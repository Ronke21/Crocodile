<text>Lawrence Dale &quot;Larry&quot; Bell (April 5, 1894 – October 20, 1956) was an American industrialist and founder of Bell Aircraft Corporation.

==Biography==
Bell was born in Mentone, Indiana, and lived there until 1907, when his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He joined his older brother Grover and stunt pilot Lincoln Beachey as a mechanic in 1912. Grover Bell was killed in a plane crash the following year, and Lawrence vowed to quit aviation for good; however, he went to work for the Glenn L. Martin Company after friends convinced him to return to the industry. He became Martin&#x27;s shop foreman at age 20, and later the company&#x27;s general manager, wanting to become partner. On July 17, 1915, he married Lucille Mainwaring (1891–1970); their marriage, without children, lasted for thirty-three years.

He left Martin in 1928 to join Consolidated Aircraft in Buffalo, New York, eventually becoming vice president and general manager. When Consolidated relocated to San Diego, Bell stayed in Buffalo and founded his own company with 56 employees, Bell Aircraft Corporation, on July 10, 1935. On a government-sponsored &quot;spy tour&quot; to Germany with 44 other industrialists in 1938, he saw the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter, and used the layout of a German aircraft factory for his Niagara Falls plant. Bell Aircraft built the P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra fighter aircraft during World War II. Bell&#x27;s P-59 Airacomet fighter was America&#x27;s first jet-powered aircraft. Postwar, the company produced the Bell X-1, the first aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight. The company began developing helicopters in 1941, with the Bell 30 taking its maiden flight in 1943. This early model evolved into the Bell 47, the first helicopter to be certified for civilian use. The Model 47 saw worldwide success, with over 5,600 being built, serving notably in the Korean War, and in innumerable civilian roles. Bell&#x27;s greatest enduring legacy is perhaps the UH-1 Iroquois, with over 16,000 produced, advanced versions of which remain in production. The &quot;Huey&quot; transformed US Army aviation during the Vietnam War, and became one of the most recognizable aircraft in history.

For his role in the X-1&#x27;s first supersonic flight, he shared the 1947 Collier Trophy with pilot Chuck Yeager and John Stack, a research scientist with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (now NASA). He was awarded the Society of Automotive Engineers&#x27; Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1944, and was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame (1977), the Army Aviation Hall of Fame (1986), and the International Aerospace Hall of Fame (2004).

<text>Frank D. Celebrezze Jr. (November 13, 1928 – March 21, 2010) was an American politician and jurist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court from 1978 to 1986.

==Career==
Celebrezze was elected as a judge of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1972, defeating Republican Robert E. Leach. He was re-elected in 1974, defeating Republican Sheldon A. Taft. Celebrezze also was elected to and served in the Ohio State Senate.

In 1978, he was elected as Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, defeating Republican Thomas M. Herbert. Celebrezze was re-elected chief justice in 1980, defeating Sara J. Harper.

In 1986, Celebrezze was defeated in a bid for another term as chief justice by Thomas J. Moyer. The race between Celebrezze and Moyer was fierce, with Moyer&#x27;s campaign accusing Celebrezze of having links to organized crime. That year Celebrezze brought a successful libel suit against &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; of Cleveland, based on an article that alleged that Celebrezze&#x27;s campaign had accepted contributions from groups with organized crime connections.

In 1994, Celebrezze ran for a seat on the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eighth District; he lost to common pleas court Judge Terrence O&#x27;Donnell.

==Family==
Celebrezze was the son of Cleveland politician Frank D. Celebrezze I and the nephew of Anthony Celebrezze, who served in the cabinets of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. His first cousin, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., was an elected official and candidate for Ohio governor. His brother, James P. Celebrezze, also served on the Ohio Supreme Court.

<text>Kathleen Louise Worley (March 16, 1958 – June 6, 2004) was an American comic book writer, best known for her work on &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;, a sexually explicit anthropomorphic animal comic book series about a female stripper. Worley was also a musician, and a writer and performer for the science fiction comedy radio program Shockwave Radio Theater.

==Biography==
Worley was born in Belleville, Illinois on March 16, 1958. After moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota in the 1970s, she became one of the early contributors the Shockwave Radio Theater there.

While in the process of divorcing from her husband, she and cartoonist and musician Reed Waller began a romantic and professional relationship. Moving in together, they wrote songs and performed, both as a duet and with local bands, as well as being popular figures at Minicon and other science fiction conventions.

In the mid 1980s, Waller and Worley began collaborating on &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;, which had originated as a strip by Waller in the local fanzine &quot;Vootie&quot;, before evolving into a nationally distributed comic book series published by Kitchen Sink Press. Four pages into issue #2, Waller suffered writer&#x27;s block, and Worley offered &quot;a few tentative suggestions about directions for the storyline, new characters, anything she could think of that might help...&quot; At his invitation, she became the series&#x27; writer, enhancing its characterization and themes. In 1988, Waller identified them both as bisexual in the letters column of the series.

&quot;Omaha&quot; went on hiatus when Worley and Waller were both injured in a car accident; this hiatus was greatly extended when they had an acrimonious parting, which made their attempts at working together difficult. During this time, Worley wrote comics for various publishers, including &quot;Mulkon Empire&quot; for Tekno Comix, &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; for Dark Horse, &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; for Disney, and a &quot;Year One&quot; annual issue of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. She married comic book writer Jim Vance, with whom she moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and had a son and daughter.

In 2002, she and Waller reached a deal with Fantagraphics to reprint &quot;Omaha,&quot; with an additional 100 pages. However, she was diagnosed with cancer, and she died June 6, 2004. Vance and Waller would later complete the &quot;Omaha&quot; series together, based on notes left by Worley.

<doc id="710742" wikidata="Q906118" url="?curid=710742" title="Disclaimer">
<text>A disclaimer is generally any statement intended to specify or delimit the scope of rights and obligations that may be exercised and enforced by parties in a legally recognized relationship. In contrast to other terms for legally operative language, the term &quot;disclaimer&quot; usually implies situations that involve some level of uncertainty, waiver, or risk.

A disclaimer may specify mutually agreed and privately arranged terms and conditions as part of a contract; or may specify warnings or expectations to the general public (or some other class of persons) in order to fulfill a duty of care owed to prevent unreasonable risk of harm or injury. Some disclaimers are intended to limit exposure to damages after a harm or injury has already been suffered. Additionally, some kinds of disclaimers may represent a voluntary waiver of a right or obligation that may be owed to the disclaimant.

Disclaimers vary in terms of their uniformity. Some may vary depending on the specific context and parties involved, while other types of disclaimers may strictly adhere to a uniform and established set of formalities that are rarely or never modified, except under official authority. Some of these formal disclaimers are required pursuant to industry regulation, qualification for protection under a safe harbor, and other situations where the exact wording of a particular clause or document may be dispositive in the event of a legal dispute. (See e.g., Product liability, Toxicity class, Rule against perpetuities, Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act.)

The presence of a disclaimer in a legally binding agreement does not necessarily guarantee that the terms of the disclaimer will be recognized and enforced in a legal dispute. There may be other legal considerations that render a disclaimer void either in whole or part.

==Tort law==

In law, a disclaimer is a statement denying responsibility intended to prevent civil liability arising for particular acts or omissions. Disclaimers are frequently made to escape the effects of the torts of negligence and of occupiers&#x27; liability towards visitors. The courts may or may not give effect to the disclaimer depending on whether the law permits exclusion of liability in the particular situation and whether the acts or omissions complained of fall within the wording of the disclaimer.

A disclaimer may take effect as a term of the contract between the person making the disclaimer and the person who is thereby prevented from suing. This kind of disclaimer is, for example, invariably found in the &#x27;terms and conditions&#x27; that a software user is confronted with when first installing the software. There will often be term(s) excluding any liability for any damage that the software might cause to the rest of the user&#x27;s software and hardware. By clicking &quot;I Agree&quot; in the dialogue box, users are agreeing to this disclaimer as a matter of contract between themselves and the software company.
At common law, disclaimers can also have effect as conditions of a license (i.e. permission) to enter the land. An occupier of land will have certain duties to take care for the personal safety of people he or she allows onto the premises. By placing a sign at the entrance to the premises, such as &quot;visitors enter at their own risk&quot;, the occupier may be able to stop entrants from successfully suing in tort for damage or injury caused by the unsafe nature of the premises. Warnings or disclaimers contained in signs may, by a slightly different legal analysis leading to the same result, allow the person who would otherwise be responsible to rely on the defense of consent.

Under UK law, the validity of disclaimers is significantly limited by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. By virtue of the Act, a business cannot use a contract term or a notice to exclude or restrict its liability for negligence causing death or personal injury. In the case of other loss or damage, a disclaimer will only be effective so long as it is reasonable in all the circumstances. The common law in other nations may also place legal limits on the validity of disclaimers; for instance, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission successfully prosecuted Target Australia for the use of inaccessible disclaimers in advertisements (the televised advertisements in question contained disclaimers that were only shown on screen for 1.50 seconds).

In the United States, disclaimers on the sale of goods are covered by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, but details vary by state. Unless considered unconscionable, disclaimers are generally enforceable as part of a contract between knowledgeable parties of comparable bargaining power, but most states do not allow a party to limit their liability for gross negligence.

== Patent law ==
In patent law, a disclaimer identifies, in a claim, subject-matter that is not claimed. By extension, a disclaimer may also mean the action of introducing a negative limitation in a claim, i.e. &quot;an amendment to a claim resulting in the incorporation therein of a &quot;negative&quot; technical feature, typically excluding from a general feature specific embodiments or areas&quot;. The allowability of disclaimers is subject to particular conditions, which may vary widely from one jurisdiction to another.

A prosecution disclaimer is another type of disclaimer in patent law. Under United States patent law a prosecution disclaimer is a statement made by a patent applicant during examination of a patent application which can limit the scope of protection provided by the resulting patent. It is one type of file-wrapper estoppel, the other being prosecution history estoppel.

== Estate law ==

In estate or inheritance law, a disclaimer (also called disclaimer of interest) is a written document voluntarily signed by an heir to an estate in which the said heir does not accept (disclaims) the part of the estate of a deceased person which the heir is entitled to receive. The disclaimed part of the estate is then inherited not necessarily by a person of the disclaiming heir&#x27;s choice, but by the next heir in line to receive that part of the estate as if the disclaiming heir were also deceased, either according to the will, beneficiary designation, or the laws of intestacy. Government tax agencies have further rules on such disclaimers. Reasons for such disclaimers may include the imminent death of the disclaimant or the fact that the disclaimant already has enough wealth.

== Literature ==
The all persons fictitious disclaimer is a standard disclaimer used in works of fiction in an attempt to avoid liability for defamation.

In the case of fan fiction, the author will usually give a disclaimer saying that the author of the fan fiction does not, in any way, profit from the story and that all creative rights to the characters belong to their original creator(s).

<doc id="710750" wikidata="Q7968216" url="?curid=710750" title="WapTV">
<text>WapTV now Miniweb was the name given to the company which originated the WTVML (Worldwide TV Mark-up Language) as a content format for the delivery of Interactive TV applications using Internet Servers. The system is an Interactive television technology platform comprising a mobile browser, a markup language, and a significant collection of associated software tools and services.

The mobile browser and mark-up language are both based upon the Open Mobile Alliance WML 1.3 specification. The WTVML mobile browser is currently available only as an OpenTV application, although an MHP version of the WapTV browser has been built for demonstration and proof of concept. An emulator exists, based on Craftwork&#x27;s, STBe OpenTV middleware emulation.

The WTVML markup language is a heavily extended superset of the WAP Forum WML 1.3 specification. WML content originally designed for wireless delivery to mobile phone handsets will work without modification on the WTVML platform, with the exception that any WBMP images will not appear on the Sky Interactive mobile rowser. WTVML version 6.1 was published as an ETSI standard in June 2004.

The mobile browser and the WTVML markup language were originally developed by Ian Valentine, Patrick Sansom Andrew Andy Hynes who founded WAPTV Ltd. The company and its technology was partly acquired by British Sky Broadcasting in 2000, and fully acquired in 2001. Platform development has continued within BSkyB, and version 7 of the mobile rowser and WTVML markup language was released in Q3 2004. The mobile rowser and WTVML markup then became the cornerstone of British Sky Broadcasting&#x27;s interactive platform strategy.

The platform brings internet-style content and interactivity to the Sky Digital platform by deploying a purpose-built WML mobile browser to the Sky Digital set-top-box over the satellite broadcast stream. Web site owners simply have to serve well formatted WTVML from their web servers to allow Sky set-top boxes and consumers to fully interact with their web services. In March 2007, Sky together with some of the Waptv founders &quot;spun off&quot; the technology into a new Company &quot;Miniweb&quot;, with the goals of furthering the work on WTVML in a global forum, and enabling the deployment of the system in other networks and devices.

One of the goals in the foundation of &quot;Miniweb Interactive&quot; was to facilitate the interoperability of Interactive TV content and Services across multiple types of TV network and devices, as it was considered that a lack of TV Centric internet standards has inhibited the ubiquitous deployment of Internet services to TVs once they become connected via Broadband. Hence the name &quot;Miniweb&quot; so called because the TVML technology had the capability of creating a &quot;mini web&quot; of TV Sites (Apps) which inter-operated across different TV middleware and chip-sets.

New IPTV networks have the need for a TV Browser in their set-top boxes and various solutions exist, however as of 2007, the WTVML mobile rowser is probably the widest deployed TV Browser and has a growing community of compatible Interactive TV Sites.

TV Sites for the OpenTV based mobile browsers are therefore web sites with a WTVML skin, and are often given a &quot;wtv.&quot; sub-domain rather than a &quot;www.&quot; sub-domain. Until the introduction of Sky HD in 2006, most Sky set-top boxes uses a standard 28.8 kbit/s modem to pull content across the online link. Because WTVML content is compiled into an encoded format by an online gateway before transmission, it must be decoded on the set-top-box before it can be drawn to the screen. For optimal performance it is recommended that WTVML files (decks) for download are no more than 70 K in size, with individual cards within each deck no more than 5 K in size. When fully loaded, the browser comprises three separate virtual layers, devoted to MPEG-4 &amp; JPEG still image presentation, MPEG video presentation and OnScreen Display (OSD) presentation respectively.

Developers can combine modes to produce very rich and diverse interactive TV interfaces. Multiple modes can be defined as a &quot;modeset&quot;. Different modes in the modeset can be referenced from the WML cards and associated with service domains, allowing the browser to change its style as the user navigates from one service to another. A modeset is a collection of one or more modes defined in a standalone XML file. A modeset is referenced at deck level from the mode attribute of the wml element. A developer can define multiple modes within a single modeset, and can initiate changes between Modes within that Modeset at card level.

The mobile browser can access Broadcast Resources as well as online resources delivered from a WTVML enabled web server. Broadcast Resources are content elements that are delivered in the satellite broadcast stream.

A &quot;doset&quot; can be used to specify a set of menu dos that can be easily applied to many cards and across many services. The doset is defined in an XML file that is referenced from the dosrc attribute of the modeset element. A single doset can be referenced by multiple modesets, and so can easily be applied across multiple domains and services.

The names and locations of font resources for use within a service are defined by an XML document usually called fontset.xml. This document must be available from a URL, and is referred to from the fontsrc attribute of the WML.

<text>The Chicago Public Library (CPL) is the public library system that serves the City of Chicago in the U.S. state of Illinois. It consists of 81 locations, including a central library, three regional libraries, and branches distributed throughout the city&#x27;s 77 Community Areas. CPL was founded in 1872, in the wake of the Great Chicago Fire.

The American Library Association reports that the library holds 5,721,334 volumes, making it the ninth largest public library in the United States by volumes held, and the 30th largest academic or public library in the United States by volumes held. The Chicago Public Library is the second largest library system in Chicago by volumes held (the largest is the University of Chicago Library). The library is the second largest public library system in the Midwest, after the Detroit Public Library. Unlike many public libraries, CPL uses the Library of Congress cataloging classification system rather than Dewey Decimal.

==History==
In the aftermath of the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, Londoner A.H. Burgess, with the aid of Thomas Hughes, drew up what would be called the &quot;English Book Donation&quot;, which proposed that England should provide a free library to the burnt-out city. The Chicago Public Library was created directly from the ashes of the great Chicago Fire. Burgess wrote on December 7, 1871 in &quot;The Daily News&quot; that &quot;I propose that England should present a Free Library to Chicago, to remain there as a mark of sympathy now, and a keepsake and a token of true brotherly kindness forever...&quot;

After circulating requests for donations throughout English society, the project donated 8,000 books. Private donors included Queen Victoria, Benjamin Disraeli, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, John Stuart Mill, John Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold.

In Chicago, town leaders petitioned Mayor Joseph Medill to hold a meeting and establish the library. The meeting led to the &quot;Illinois Library Act of 1872&quot;, which allowed Illinois cities to establish tax-supported libraries. In April 1872, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance establishing the Chicago Public Library. In the rebuilding section of the city, on January 1, 1873, the Chicago Public Library officially opened its doors in an abandoned iron water tank at LaSalle and Adams Streets. The collection included 3,157 volumes. The water tank was in diameter, high and with a foundation. A two-story office building was soon built around it to hold city offices, and a third floor reading room was built for the library.

On October 24, 1873, William Frederick Poole was elected the first head librarian by the library&#x27;s board of directors. Poole was mainly concerned during his tenure on building the circulation. In 1874, circulation services began with 13,000 out of 17,533 available for lending. The library moved from place to place during its first 24 years. Eleven years it spent on the fourth floor of city hall. In 1887, Poole resigned to organize the private, research Newberry Library of Chicago.

On October 15, 1887, Frederick H. Hild was elected the second Librarian of the Chicago Public Library and securing a permanent home was his primary drive. Ten years later, the Central Library was opened. Designed by the Boston firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge in the same academic classical style as their building for the Art Institute of Chicago, it is located on Michigan Avenue between Washington Street and Randolph Street on land donated by the Grand Army of the Republic, a Civil War Veterans group led by John A. Logan, a Civil War General and U.S. Senator from Illinois. In return for the land, the Library was to maintain a Civil War collection and exhibit in a G.A.R. room until the last northern Civil War veteran died. The library would remain on this site for the next 96 years. The building is now the Chicago Cultural Center.

Henry Eduard Legler assumed the leadership of the Chicago Public Library on October 11, 1909. Previously a Wisconsin Progressive, he was well known as an aggressive advocate of the expansion of library service. In 1916, Legler presented his &quot;Library Plan for the Whole City&quot;, the first comprehensive branch library system in the nation. A landmark in library history, the plan called for an extensive network of neighborhood library locations throughout Chicago. The goal of the plan was to bring &quot;library service within the walking distance of home for every person in Chicago who can read or wants to use books.&quot;
Legler was succeeded by his assistant Carl B. Roden in 1918. Roden served as Chief Librarian until 1950. The South Chicago Branch library history from 1937-1947 has been explored by Latham who focused on its service to an industrial community and adult education. She has also examined the role of the John Toman Branch library from 1927-1940.

Roden was succeeded in 1951 by Chief Librarian Gertrude E. Gscheidle. During her tenure the Library expanded its service to Chicago&#x27;s neighborhoods by modernizing its bookmobile services.
In the 1960s several new neighborhood branch libraries were constructed or were established in leased storefronts or reading rooms.

The two-story, modernist Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, named after the &quot;Father of Modern Black Historiography,&quot; opened its doors in December 1975, to serve as the South Side. A decade later, Chicago Public Library replaced its north side regional library when the post-modernist Conrad Sulzer Regional Library opened to the public in late 1985. The Woodson regional branch library features the Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection, one of the largest repositories of African-American archival information in the Midwest. It holds the papers of many notable Chicagoans, such as John H. Sengstacke, Robert S. Abbott, Doris E. Saunders, Timuel Black, Rev. Addie L. Wyatt, and numerous others.

The class politics of urban public librarianship through &quot;outreach&quot; efforts during the federal War on Poverty uses the Chicago Public Library as a case study during the 1970s under director Alex Ladenson.

In 1974, the board of directors authorized an $11 million renovation of the Central Library. While the restoration of the original central library proved a great success, the collections remained warehoused outside the old library while the City debated the status of the future of the central library. One plan was to move the library to the former Rothchild/Goldblatts Department Store which stood empty on Chicago&#x27;s State Street and had reverted to City ownership.

From 1982 to 1985, Amanda Sullivan Randle Rudd rose to become the first African-American to head of the Chicago Public Library system. Rudd had experienced segregated libraries during her childhood in South Carolina. Her stewardship in Chicago saw a particular focus on literacy services, and she strongly mentored younger colleagues, including a future Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden.

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; editorial board and Cindy Pritzker, then President of the Library Board, launched a grassroots campaign to build a new state-of-the-art central library. On July 29, 1987, Mayor Harold Washington and the Chicago City Council authorized a design and construction competition for a new, one-and-a-half block $144 million library at 400 South State Street.

In 1991, the Harold Washington Library Center, became Chicago&#x27;s new central library. It is named for the late mayor Harold Washington. It was the world&#x27;s largest municipal public library at the time of its opening. It is accessible from the Brown, Orange, Purple and new Pink Line trains at the &quot;Library&quot; stop, from the Blue Line at the &quot;LaSalle&quot; and &quot;Jackson&quot; stops, as well as from the Red Line at the &quot;Jackson&quot; stop.

In January 1994, Mary A. Dempsey was appointed Library Commissioner by Mayor Richard M. Daley and served in that role until January 2012. Under her direction, the Library launched the largest branch building program in its history, constructing or renovating 44 branch libraries; installed more than 2500 free public access computers and wifi throughout the library system; completed 2 strategic plans; established professional development and training programs for all library staff; and launched signature programs such as One Book, One Chicago; YOUmedia the museum and Ravinia free admission programs; Teen Volume; Law at the Library; and Money Smart financial literacy programs for adults and teens. The library&#x27;s success in revitalizing communities through branch library development was analyzed by Robert Putnam in 2003.

The &quot;Charlotte Kim Scholar in Residence Program&quot; took place from 1999–2008. Scholars included Camila Alire (1999); Leigh S. Estabrook (2002); Kathleen de la Peña McCook (2003); Joan C. Durrance (2004); Michael Stephens (2005); Maureen Sullivan (2006); George Needham (2007) and Patricia Martin (2008).

&quot;The Engaged Library: Chicago Stories of Community Building&quot; published by the Urban Library Council (2006) highlights several Chicago public libraries and their efforts in strengthening the community and effectively enhancing the well-being and capacities of urban neighborhood residents, associations, non-profits and public institutions.

Brian Andrew Bannon was appointed Library Commissioner effective March 2012.

Some of the free programming the Chicago Public Library offers include: The One Book One Chicago program, The Summer Learning Challenge, Bookamania (held every November), Kids Museum Passport Program (allows patrons free admission to a variety of Chicago&#x27;s world-class institutions), and Words and Music Program (which provides patrons with free lawn tickets to selected Ravinia concerts). The library also offers a free homework help desk daily in order to serve struggling students after school.

The Chicago Public Library offers free lecture series covering a variety of topics including: Law at the Library (a free monthly lecture series that offers participants the opportunity to speak with a legal professional about a variety of legal topics), Money Smart (a series of financial literacy programs), and Author Series.

The Chicago Public Library provides access to a large selection of databases, most of which are also available for use at home or other remote location with a Chicago Public Library card. Internet computers are available for anyone with a Chicago Public Library card. Also, anyone can use the Wi-Fi on their own laptops, tablets and smartphones without a library card.

In June 2013, the library announced a $1 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation establishing a partnership between the Chicago Public Library and the public library system of Aarhus, Denmark.

That same month, the Library opened its Innovation Lab, featuring a Maker Lab with 3D software, milling machine, laser cutters, and 3D printers. The space has proven highly successful in offering free access to the latest in advanced manufacturing technology and was awarded the Chicago Innovation Awards Social Innovator Award in October 2013.

In late 2013, a study released by the Information Science Department of Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany ranked Chicago Public Library first in the United States and third in the world, when comparing 31 major urban libraries taking leadership roles in supporting &quot;smart cities&quot; in a &quot;knowledge economy.&quot;

Andrea Telli was appointed Library Commissioner effective June 2019.

In 2019, CPL became the largest public library system in the United States to eliminate fines for borrowed overdue items. All existing fines were forgiven. There will still be due dates, and patrons are still required to return items or replace them to continue their borrowing privileges.

Chris Brown was appointed Library Commissioner effective February 2021.

In 2023, the CPL celebrated its 150th anniversary with an exhibit exploring the history of its branches.

<doc id="710768" wikidata="Q7738769" url="?curid=710768" title="The Hangovers (Cornell University)">
<text>The Hangovers are a men&#x27;s collegiate a cappella ensemble based at Cornell University. Founded in 1968, they are the oldest active &quot;a cappella&quot; group on campus and are the official &quot;a cappella&quot; subset of the Cornell University Glee Club, itself the oldest student organization of any kind at Cornell University. The Hangovers&#x27; repertoire consists mainly of popular songs arranged for the ensemble by its members and alumni, but the group also performs traditional Cornell songs, as well as selections from the Glee Club repertoire on occasion.

The Hangovers have competed in international competitions such as the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, advancing to the semifinals in 2001. The Hangovers can be heard on the PBS American Experience documentary &quot;Rescue at Sea.&quot; The Hangovers have performed for Helmut Schmidt, the widow of Anwar Sadat, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger, Cornell alumna Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and other notables.

==History==
The group&#x27;s name is taken from the name that was given to fifth-year students in Cornell&#x27;s five-year architecture and engineering programs of the 1960s. After their fourth (senior) year, students in these programs had to &quot;hang over&quot; an additional year to complete their degrees. Several of the group&#x27;s original members were &quot;hangovers&quot; in this sense at the time of the group&#x27;s formation, hence the name. The double entendre of the more widely accepted meaning of the word is intentional, and is a theme carried on in the titles of the ensemble&#x27;s concerts and albums.

The Hangovers, at years old, are the oldest active a cappella ensemble at Cornell University. The previous holders of that distinction, the Cayuga&#x27;s Waiters, split from the Cornell University Glee Club in 1956 and existed as an independent ensemble until their dissolution in 2017.

==Concerts==

The Hangovers have two major on-campus concerts every year, one in the Fall semester and one in late in the Spring semester. The Fall concert is named Fall Tonic, a title resurrected in and used since 1980 in homage to the Sherwoods, who preceded the Hangovers as a Glee Club subset and had an annual autumn concert of the same title. The first guest groups at the 1980 Fall Tonic were Yale&#x27;s Proof in the Pudding, University of Rochester&#x27;s Yellowjackets, and Cornell&#x27;s Nothing But Treble.

The Hangovers&#x27; Spring concert, in keeping with their penchant with alcoholic double entendres, is called Happy Hour. The first Happy Hour was held in Barnes Hall in the early spring of 1993. Happy Hour II, and every Happy Hour since, has been held in Sage Chapel (due to its increased seating capacity and it being home to many Cornell University Glee Club events). Happy Hour II was also the first to be held the night before Slope Day (as a &quot;kick-off&quot; event).

==Recordings==

The Hangovers have released numerous albums over the years, the titles of which are all puns on drinking, or drinking-related themes. As Michael Slon points out in his book Songs From The Hill, one album, &quot;Behind Bars&quot;, manages to achieve a quadruple-entendre: first, for the normal meaning of the phrase, meaning &quot;incarcerated&quot;; second, the reference to bars as drinking establishments; third, an allusion to bars as a period of music, and finally, as a reference to the striped rugby shirts the Hangovers wear at some performances. In 1980, their original single titled &quot;Facetime&quot; received national recognition and earned mention in Yale&#x27;s &quot;Guide to Selective Colleges.&quot; The song was recently re-recorded on the album &quot;Blackout&quot; with another original song, &quot;River to the Sea&quot;.

The Hangovers have released sixteen albums and one EP:

* &quot;The Hangovers&quot; (1970; re-released in 2001 on CD)
* &quot;Slightly Sober&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Facetime&quot; (1981)
* &quot;Hangin&#x27; Out&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Cheers&quot; (1986)
* &quot;Behind Bars&quot; (1989)
* &quot;On The Rocks&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Moonshine&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Spirits&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Shot In The Dark&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Vintage&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Blackout&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Three Sheets to the Wind&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Final Draught&quot; (2013)
* &quot;A Flight (EP)&quot; (2015)
* &quot;Open 5th&quot; (2018)
* &quot;Speak Easy&quot; (2024)

&quot;Three Sheets to the Wind&quot; received four award nominations for the 2009 Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards: Best Male Collegiate Album, Best Humor Song (&quot;You Got a &#x27;C&#x27; &quot;), Best Male Collegiate Solo (Evan Graham for &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot;), and Best Hip-Hop/R&amp;B Song (&quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot;). &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; was also featured on the 2009 Best of College A Cappella compilation album.

==Other performances and tours==
Independently of the Cornell University Glee Club, the Hangovers have performed extensively with other collegiate a cappella groups, primarily in the Eastern United States. The ensemble has gone on numerous domestic and international tours, traveling to Germany with the Glee Club in 1970, and making their first solo tour to Bermuda in 1971.

On a 1995 tour to Japan, the Hangovers received attention by donating half of their tour profits to the Kobe Earthquake Relief Fund; on a subsequent tour to Japan and Korea in the spring of 1998, they performed on Inter-FM, a Western-music radio station, in addition to other performances at such venues as the Tokyo-American Club, the United States naval base in Atsugi, Seoul National University, Ewha University and concluded the tour at the Seoul National Arts Center as a guest group for the Seoul National Orchestra.

The Hangovers have also toured Antigua, Jamaica, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Holland, and France; the 2003 tour through Europe had corporate sponsorship. In March 2004, they were shown performing on the Brazilian national evening news, Jornal Nacional. In January 2006, the Hangovers performed to a sold-out audience at the French embassy in Washington, D.C. The Hangovers toured Spain in Spring 2019, including stops in Madrid and Barcelona. The group&#x27;s most recent international tour brought them to London and Paris in January of 2023. 

==Alumni==
The Hangovers have an active network of alumni, who return to Cornell in large numbers for Fall Tonic and also join the current members to sing at the Treman Concert every year during Cornell&#x27;s Reunions Weekend. Alumni include such notables as Alan Keyes, Dave Ross and Michael B. Polk. Numerous alumni are also involved in post-collegiate a cappella projects. Notable among these are members of the Tone Rangers, a Washington, D.C.–based a cappella group composed almost entirely of Hangovers and Yale University Whiffenpoofs alumni, and The Breakers, a group of former Hangovers who recently toured Malaysia.

<text>Oral literature, orature, or folk literature is a genre of literature that is spoken or sung in contrast to that which is written, though much oral literature has been transcribed. There is no standard definition, as anthropologists have used varying descriptions for oral literature or folk literature. A broad conceptualization refers to it as literature characterized by oral transmission and the absence of any fixed form. It includes the stories, legends, and history passed through generations in a spoken form.

==Background==
Pre-literate societies, by definition, have no written literature, but may possess rich and varied oral traditions—such as folk epics, folk narratives (including fairy tales and fables), folk drama, proverbs and folksongs—that effectively constitute an oral literature. Even when these are collected and published by scholars such as folklorists and paremiographers, the result is still often referred to as &quot;oral literature&quot;. The different genres of oral literature pose classification challenges to scholars because of cultural dynamism in the modern digital age.

Literate societies may continue an oral tradition — particularly within the family (for example bedtime stories) or informal social structures. The telling of urban legends may be considered an example of oral literature, as can jokes and also oral poetry including slam poetry which has been a televised feature on Russell Simmons&#x27; &quot;Def Poetry&quot;; performance poetry is a genre of poetry that consciously shuns the written form.

Oral literatures forms a generally more fundamental component of culture, but operates in many ways as one might expect literature to do. The Ugandan scholar Pio Zirimu introduced the term orature in an attempt to avoid an oxymoron, but &quot;oral literature&quot; remains more common both in academic and popular writing. &quot;The Encyclopaedia of African Literature&quot;, edited by Simon Gikandi (Routledge, 2003), gives this definition: &quot;Orature means something passed on through the spoken word, and because it is based on the spoken language it comes to life only in a living community. Where community life fades away, orality loses its function and dies. It needs people in a living social setting: it needs life itself.&quot;

In &quot;Songs and Politics in Eastern Africa&quot;, edited by Kimani Njogu and Hervé Maupeu (2007), it is stated (page 204) that Zirimu, who coined the term, defines orature as &quot;the use of utterance as an aesthetic means of expression&quot; (as quoted by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, 1988). According to the book &quot;Defining New Idioms and Alternative Forms of Expression&quot;, edited by Eckhard Breitinger (Rodopi, 1996, page 78): &quot;This means that any &#x27;oral society&#x27; had to develop means to make the spoken word last, at least for a while. We tend to regard all the genres of orature as belonging to the homogeneous complex of folklore.&quot;

Building on Zirimu&#x27;s orature concept, Mbube Nwi-Akeeri explained that Western theories cannot effectively capture and explain oral literature, particularly those indigenous to regions such as Africa. The reason is that there are elements to oral traditions in these places that cannot be captured by words alone, such as the existence of gestures, dance, and the interaction between the storyteller and the audience. According to Nwi-Akeeri, oral literature is not only a narrative, but also a performance.

==History of oral literature==
Oral tradition is seen in societies with vigorous oral conveyance practices to be a general term inclusive of both oral literature and any written literature, including sophisticated writings, as well, potentially, as visual and performance arts which may interact with these forms, extend their expression, or offer additional expressive media. Thus even where no phrase in local language which exactly translates &quot;oral literature&quot; is used, what constitutes &quot;oral literature&quot; as understood today is already understood to be part or all of the lore media with which a society conducts profound and common cultural affairs among its members, orally. In this sense, oral lore is an ancient practice and concept natural to the earliest storied communications and transmissions of bodies of knowledge and culture in verbal form from the dawn of language-based human societies, and &#x27;oral literature&#x27; thus understood was putatively recognized in times prior to recordings of history in non-oral media, including painting and writing.

Oral literature as a concept, after 19th-century antecedents, was more widely circulated by Hector Munro Chadwick and Nora Kershaw Chadwick in their comparative work on the &quot;growth of literature&quot; (1932–40). In 1960, Albert B. Lord published &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot;, which influentially examined fluidity in both ancient and later texts and &quot;oral-formulaic&quot; principles used during composition-in-performance, particularly by contemporary South Slavic bards relating long traditional narratives.

From the 1970s onwards, the term &quot;Oral literature&quot; appears in the work of both literary scholars and anthropologists: Finnegan (1970, 1977), Görög-Karady (1976), Bauman (1986), in the World Oral Literature Project and in the articles of the journal &quot;Cahiers de Littérature Orale&quot;.

==Deaf culture==

Although deaf people communicate manually rather than orally, their culture and traditions are considered in the same category as oral literature. Stories, jokes and poetry are passed on from person to person with no written medium.

<text>A partial zero-emission vehicle, in the United States, is an automobile that has zero evaporative emissions from its fuel system, has a 15-year (or at least 150,000-mile) warranty on its emission-control components, and meets SULEV tailpipe-emission standards.

== Definition and history ==
In California, PZEVs have their own administrative category for low-emission vehicles. The category was made in a bargain between automakers and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), so that automobile makers could delay making mandated zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)—battery electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles.

The super-ultra-low-emission vehicle (SULEV) standard is more stringent than the ultra-low-emission vehicle (ULEV) and low-emission vehicle standards. All emissions-related components, including the electric-propulsion parts of hybrid electric vehicles, must be warranted for 15 years or 150,000 miles.

Advanced Technology PZEVs (AT-PZEVs) are at least as &quot;clean&quot; as regular PZEVs. CARB also prepared a TZEV (Transitional ZEV, formerly Enhanced AT-PZEV) category for plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and hydrogen vehicles. (Not to be confused with Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles which are certified as ZEV or Zero Emission Vehicles.) In addition to the 15 year or 150,000 mile warranty (dependent on the automaker for warranty length) for zero evaporative (fuel system) emissions, and SULEV tailpipe emissions, PHEVs must also warranty their traction battery for 10 years or 150,000 miles. While PHEVs and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles exist, none meet this stringent standard.

Except some hybrids and alternative-fuel vehicles, PZEVs do not inherently offer consumers any kind of incentives other than the extended emissions warranty. In particular, PZEV vehicles do not automatically qualify for the hybrid vehicle tax credit or for the &quot;clean air vehicle&quot; decal that used to allow hybrid car drivers to use car-pool lanes.

PZEVs do, however, provide benefits to the originating automaker in the form of ZEV credits. Automakers must have a certain number of ZEV credits based on the number of vehicles they sell annually in California, with exceptions granted for small volume manufacturers. Without ZEV credits, automakers cannot sell in California. Automakers with excess credits can sell them. No automaker has ever missed compliance.

Originally, PZEVs were available only in California, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont, some regions near those states, and Canada. The six &quot;clean-car states&quot; had implemented California&#x27;s motor-vehicle pollution-control rules. Other states soon began implementing these standards, including Alaska, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington, and PZEVs are now widely available in the United States.

<text>Sir Edward Frederick William David Walugembe Mutebi Luwangula Mutesa II (19 November 1924 – 21 November 1969) was a Ugandan royal and statesman who served as the first president of Uganda from 1962 to 1966, when he was overthrown by Milton Obote. Mutesa was also the Kabaka (king) of the traditional kingdom of Buganda in Uganda from 22 November 1939 until his death in 1969. 

He was often referred as King Freddie by the foreign press, a name rarely used in Uganda. An ardent defender of Buganda&#x27;s interests, especially its traditional autonomy, he often threatened to make the kingdom independent both before and after Uganda&#x27;s independence to preserve it. These firm convictions also later led to conflicts with his erstwhile political ally Milton Obote, who would eventually overthrow him.

Mutesa was crowned Kabaka on his 18th birthday in 1942, three years after the death of his father Daudi Cwa II of Buganda during British colonial rule in Uganda. In 1953, he attempted to have Buganda secede to retain the kingdom&#x27;s independence from a proposed British colonial federation in East Africa. He was deposed and exiled by British colonial governor Andrew Cohen, but was allowed to return to the country two years later in the wake of a popular backlash known as the Kabaka Crisis under the terms of the 1955 Buganda Agreement.

In the years preceding Uganda&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, Mutesa became part of the monarchist Kabaka Yekka party which then formed a coalition with Milton Obote&#x27;s Uganda People&#x27;s Congress. The year after Uganda&#x27;s independence, Mutesa was named the first President of Uganda (then a non-executive position) in 1963 with Obote as Prime Minister. Mutesa&#x27;s alliance with Obote collapsed in 1964 over the Ugandan lost counties referendum. It worsened in 1966, resulting in Obote overthrowing him and forcing him into exile in the United Kingdom, where he died three years later.

==Early life==
Mutesa was born at the house of Albert Ruskin Cook in Makindye, Kampala, on 19 November 1924, the fifth son of the Kabaka Daudi Cwa II, who reigned between 1897 and 1939. Mutesa&#x27;s mother was Lady Irene Drusilla Namaganda, of the Nte clan. He was educated at King&#x27;s College Budo, a prestigious school in Uganda.

Upon the death of his father on 22 November 1939, he was elected Kabaka by the Lukiiko at the age of 15 and was installed outside the Lubiri at Mengo on 25 November 1939. He reigned under a Council of Regents until he came of age and assumed full powers.

==Education==
He attended King&#x27;s College Budo before he went to England to complete his education at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he joined the University Officer Training Corps and was subsequently commissioned as a captain in the Grenadier Guards.

==Reign==
Mutesa II was crowned as &quot;Kabaka&quot; at Buddo on 19 November 1942, his eighteenth birthday. At that time, Buganda was still part of the Uganda Protectorate, a territory within the British Empire.

The years between 1945 and 1950 saw widespread protests against both the Governor of Uganda&#x27;s and &quot;Kabaka&quot; Mutesa&#x27;s governments.

In the early 1950s the British Government floated the idea of uniting British East Africa (Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika) into a federation. Africans feared that this would lead to their coming under the control of Kenya&#x27;s white settler community, as had happened in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Baganda, fearing they would lose the limited autonomy they had under British rule, were particularly opposed. Mutesa himself opposed the proposal, and thus came into conflict with the British Governor, Sir Andrew Cohen, prompting the Kabaka crisis. In 1953, the &quot;Lukiiko&quot; (Parliament) of Buganda sought independence from the Uganda Protectorate, with Mutesa himself demanding that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate of Uganda and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Governor Cohen&#x27;s response was to depose and exile the &quot;Kabaka&quot; on 30 November, creating massive protests among the Baganda. Mutesa&#x27;s forced departure, carried out by Wing Commander Clive Beadon, made him a martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism set off a storm of protest. Cohen could find no one among the Baganda willing and able to mobilise support for his schemes. After two years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate &quot;Kabaka Freddie&quot;, who returned to Kampala on 17 October 1955 under a negotiated settlement which made him a constitutional monarch and gave the Baganda the right to elect representatives to the kingdom&#x27;s parliament, the &quot;Lukiiko&quot;. Mutesa&#x27;s standing up to Cohen greatly boosted his popularity in the kingdom.

In 1962, Uganda became independent from Britain under the leadership of Milton Obote. Under the country&#x27;s new constitution, the Kingdom of Buganda became a semi-autonomous part of a new Ugandan federation. The federal Prime Minister was Obote, the leader of the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC), which entered a governing coalition with the dominant Buganda regional party, Kabaka Yekka. The post of Governor-General of Uganda was abolished with the attainment of republican status and replaced by a non-executive President.

Obote and the UPC reached a deal with Mutesa to support his election to the Presidency of Uganda. In a session of Parliament on 4 October 1963, Mutesa was elected President via secret ballot with the support of over two thirds of the members.

In 1964, the coalition between Mutesa and Obote&#x27;s parties collapsed over the imposition, against Mutesa&#x27;s will, of a referendum to decide the fate of two &quot;lost counties&quot;. Residents of the two counties voted overwhelmingly in favour of their return from Buganda to Bunyoro. In 1966, Mutesa&#x27;s estrangement from Obote merged with another crisis. Obote faced a possible removal from office by factional infighting within his own party. He had the other four leading members of his party arrested and detained, and then suspended the federal constitution and declared himself President of Uganda in February 1966, deposing Mutesa. The Buganda regional Parliament passed a resolution in May 1966 declaring that &quot;de jure&quot; Buganda&#x27;s incorporation into Uganda had ended with the suspension of the constitution and requesting the federal government to vacate the capital city, which was in Buganda. Obote responded with an armed attack upon the &quot;Kabaka&quot;″s palace, sending Mutesa into exile in the United Kingdom via Burundi, and in 1967 a new constitution abolished all of Uganda&#x27;s kingdoms, including Buganda.

== Exile ==
While in exile, Mutesa wrote an autobiography, &quot;The Desecration of My Kingdom&quot;.

Mutesa died of alcohol poisoning in his London flat, No. 28 Orchard House in Rotherhithe, in 1969. Identified by the Metropolitan Police as suicide, the death has been viewed as assassination by those who claim Mutesa may have been force-fed vodka by agents of the Obote regime. Mutesa was interviewed in his flat only a few hours before his death by the British journalist John Simpson, who found that he was sober and in good spirits. Simpson reported this to the police the following day on hearing of Mutesa&#x27;s death, but this line of inquiry was not pursued.

After Mutesa&#x27;s body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley, it was provisionally interred in a vault in the catacombs of St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Kensal Green Cemetery, West London on Wednesday 3 December 1969. This was after a requiem service that was held at Wellington Barracks Chapel. It was attended by Democratic Party (DP) leader, Ben Kiwanuka, Bishop Adrian Kivumbi Ddungu of Masaka Diocese and Monsignor Anatoli Kamya who represented Kampala Archdiocese. The requiem service was jointly conducted by Bishop C.E Stuart, John Taylor and Rev. S.J Davies. His body was finally repatriated back to Uganda in 1971 after the overthrow of Obote and given a state funeral at Kasubi Nabulagala. The president who ordered the state funeral was Idi Amin, who as army commander had led the assault on Mutesa&#x27;s palace in 1966. It is said by many accounts that while in exile in London, &quot;King Freddie&quot; was both financially strapped and lost.

==Married life==

<doc id="710776" wikidata="Q3242291" url="?curid=710776" title="Chief constable">
<text>Chief Constable is the rank used by the chief police officer of every territorial police force in the United Kingdom except for the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police, as well as the chief officers of the three &#x27;special&#x27; national police forces, the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary. The title is also held by the chief officers of the principal Crown Dependency police forces (the Isle of Man Constabulary, States of Guernsey Police Service, and States of Jersey Police) and the Sovereign Base Areas Police in Cyprus. The title was also held, &quot;ex officio&quot;, by the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers under the Police Reform Act 2002. It was also the title of the chief officer of the Royal Parks Constabulary until this agency was disbanded in 2004.

Throughout the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies there are currently fifty chief constables. These consist of the chief officers of 37 English territorial forces outside London, four Welsh territorial forces, the Police Service of Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, three special national forces and three Crown Dependency constabularies.

The chief officers of some police departments in Canada also hold the title of chief constable.

==History==
The title is derived from the original local parish constables of the 18th century and earlier. &quot;Constable&quot; and &quot;constabulary&quot; were terms adopted in an attempt to provide a historical link with the older forces – the term is derived from the Latin &quot;comes stabuli&quot; (keeper of the stables) – and to emphasise local control. Much of the debate about policing in the early 19th century, when modern police forces were introduced in the United Kingdom, concerned fears that the new forces might become paramilitary agents of central government control. To this day other British police ranks, such as inspector and superintendent, are determinedly non-paramilitary – only police sergeants hold a quasi-military rank and even then the term sergeant had long existed as a non-military officer of subordinate rank.

The County Police Act 1839 gave the counties of England and Wales the opportunity to establish full-time police forces, headed by a chief constable who was appointed by the justices of the peace of the county. The first county to implement this was Wiltshire Constabulary, which appointed Captain Samuel Meredith RN its first chief constable on 28 November 1839. Other counties followed this pattern; for instance, Essex appointed its first chief constable on 11 February 1840.

Originally, most borough police forces were commanded by a head constable, although this rank was superseded by chief constable in most forces in the later 19th century and early 20th century and was almost completely abolished by the Police Act 1919. Liverpool City Police was the only large force to retain it until then.

The first woman to hold the rank of chief constable was Pauline Clare, appointed Chief Constable of the Lancashire Constabulary on 14 June 1995.

==Characteristics of office==

The population of areas for which chief constables are responsible varies from under a hundred thousand to two or three million, and it is commonplace for chief constables for larger force areas to be drawn from the chief constables of smaller forces. A chief constable has no senior officer. Prior to 2012, a chief constable was responsible to a police authority. In England and Wales, the chief constable is now appointed by and accountable to the Police and Crime Commissioner of their service, or to an elected mayor, who may also dismiss the chief constable.

The chief constable&#x27;s badge of rank, worn on the epaulettes, consists of crossed tipstaffs in a laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown. This is similar to the insignia of a lieutenant-general in the British Army, and is also worn by an assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police.

The chief constable is assisted by a deputy chief constable (DCC) and one or more assistant chief constables (ACC). The chief constable, DCC and ACCs are collectively known as the &quot;chief officers&quot; of a force.

==Salaries==
The salaries of chief constables vary from force to force, primarily on the basis of the population of their force&#x27;s territory, but the amounts are fixed centrally. As of 2022, the highest paid is the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, on £230,000, in recognition of the unique security challenges and political sensitivity of that office. Other salaries range from £181,455 in the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, down to £127,017 in Central Scotland. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and their deputy are paid significantly more than any chief constable, partly because the Metropolitan Police has national anti-terrorism and security duties that overlap with other local forces, but also because the Metropolitan Police is by far the largest force in the country. As of 2011, the commissioner earns an annual salary of £260,088, whilst their deputy earns £214,722.

==Metropolitan Police==

In London, the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police are led by commissioners rather than chief constables. Chief constable was, however, a lower rank in the Metropolitan Police which existed between 1886 and 1946.

In 1869, the divisions of the Metropolitan Police were grouped into four districts, and four new officers called district superintendents were appointed to command them, ranking between the divisional superintendents and the two assistant commissioners. These officers were to be generally military officers, civil servants or lawyers who were directly appointed to the rank. This caused a certain amount of concern, since some saw it as the creation of an &quot;officer class&quot; for the police, which had always been resisted. Their rank badge consisted of crossed tipstaves in a wreath.

In 1886, the rank of district superintendent was renamed chief constable, as it was decided that it could be confused with the divisional superintendents. Unlike their superiors, chief constables were actually sworn into the office of constable, hence the name. A fifth chief constable was later created in the Criminal Investigation Department. In 1919 the rank became junior to the new rank of deputy assistant commissioners, who took over the districts in 1933, with the chief constables remaining as their deputies until the latter rank was finally renamed deputy commander in 1946.

<doc id="710778" wikidata="Q1207629" url="?curid=710778" title="Cradle of civilization">
<text>A cradle of civilization is a location and a culture where civilization was developed independent of other civilizations in other locations. A civilization is any complex society characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems and graphic arts).

Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization: Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient India and Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in Afro-Eurasia (previously called the Old World), while the Caral–Supe civilization of coastal Peru and the Olmec civilization of Mexico are believed to be the earliest in the Americas – previously known in Western literature as the New World. All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance (except possibly Caral–Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus to support the centralized government, political leaders, religious leaders, and public works of the urban centers of the early civilizations.

Less formally, the term &quot;cradle of civilization&quot; is often used to refer to other historic ancient civilizations, such as Greece or Rome, which have both been called the &quot;cradle of Western civilization&quot;.

==Rise of civilization==
The earliest signs of a process leading to sedentary culture can be seen in the Levant to as early as 12,000 BC, when the Natufian culture became sedentary; it evolved into an agricultural society by 10,000 BC. The importance of water to safeguard an abundant and stable food supply, due to favourable conditions for hunting, fishing and gathering resources including cereals, provided an initial &quot;wide spectrum economy&quot; that triggered the creation of permanent villages.

The earliest proto-urban settlements with several thousand inhabitants emerged in the Neolithic which began in Western Asia in 10,000 BC. The first cities to house several tens of thousands were Uruk, Ur, Kish and Eridu in Mesopotamia, followed by Susa in Elam and Memphis in Egypt, all by the 31st century BC (see Historical urban community sizes).

Historic times are marked apart from prehistoric times when &quot;records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations&quot;—in written or oral form. If the rise of civilization is taken to coincide with the development of writing out of proto-writing, then the Near Eastern Chalcolithic (the transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age during the 4th millennium BC) and the development of proto-writing in Harappa in the Indus Valley of South Asia around 3,300 BC are the earliest instances, followed by Chinese proto-writing evolving into the oracle bone script, and again by the emergence of Mesoamerican writing systems from about 900 BC.

In the absence of written documents, most aspects of the rise of early civilizations are contained in archaeological assessments that document the development of formal institutions and the material culture. A &quot;civilized&quot; way of life is ultimately linked to conditions coming almost exclusively from intensive agriculture. Gordon Childe defined the development of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution of Western Asia, triggering the development of settled communities, and the urban revolution which also first emerged in Western Asia, which enhanced tendencies towards dense settlements, specialized occupational groups, social classes, exploitation of surpluses, monumental public buildings and writing. Few of those conditions, however, are unchallenged by the records: dense cities were not attested in Egypt&#x27;s Old Kingdom (unlike Mesopotamia) and cities had a dispersed population in the Maya area; the Incas lacked writing although they could keep records with Quipus which might also have had literary uses; and often monumental architecture preceded any indication of village settlement. For instance, in present-day Louisiana, researchers have determined that cultures that were primarily nomadic organized over generations to build earthwork mounds at seasonal settlements as early as 3400 BC. Rather than a succession of events and preconditions, the rise of civilization could equally be hypothesized as an accelerated process that started with incipient agriculture and culminated in the Oriental Bronze Age.

==Single or multiple cradles==
Scholars once thought that civilization began in the Fertile Crescent and spread out from there by influence. Scholars now believe that civilizations arose independently at several locations in both hemispheres. They have observed that sociocultural developments occurred along different timeframes. &quot;Sedentary&quot; and &quot;nomadic&quot; communities continued to interact considerably; they were not strictly divided among widely different cultural groups. The concept of a cradle of civilization has a focus where the inhabitants came to build cities, to create writing systems, to experiment in techniques for making pottery and using metals, to domesticate animals, and to develop complex social structures involving class systems.

Today, scholarship generally identifies six areas where civilization emerged independently: the Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and the Levant; the Nile Valley; the Indo-Gangetic Plain; the North China Plain; the Andean Coast; and the Mesoamerican Gulf Coast.

==Cradles of civilization==

===Fertile Crescent===
The Fertile Crescent comprises a crescent-shaped region of elevated terrain in West Asia, encompassing regions of modern-day Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq, extending to the Zagros Mountains in Iran. It stands as one of the earliest regions globally where agricultural practices emerged, marking the advent of sedentary farming communities.

By 10,200 BC, fully developed Neolithic cultures, characterized by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7600 to 6000 BC) phases, emerged within the Fertile Crescent. These cultures diffused eastward into South Asia and westward into Europe and North Africa. Among the notable PPNA settlements is Jericho, located in the Jordan Valley, believed to be the world&#x27;s earliest established city, with initial settlement dating back to around 9600 BC and fortification occurring around 6800 BC.

Current theories and findings identify the Fertile Crescent as the first and oldest cradle of civilization. Examples of sites in this area are the early Neolithic site of Göbekli Tepe (9500–8000 BC) and Çatalhöyük (7500–5700 BC).

====Mesopotamia====

In Mesopotamia (a region encompassing modern Iraq and bordering regions of Southeast Turkey, Northeast Syria and Northwest Iran), the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation. Neolithic cultures emerged in the region from 8000 BC onwards. The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies. It is because of this that the Fertile Crescent region, and Mesopotamia in particular, are often referred to as the cradle of civilization. The period known as the Ubaid period (c. 6500 to 3800 BC) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain, although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium. It was during the Ubaid period that the movement toward urbanization began. Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities, particularly in Northern Mesopotamia (later Assyria), and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south.

Around 6000 BC, Neolithic settlements began to appear all over Egypt. Studies based on morphological, genetic, and archaeological data have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent in the Near East arriving in Egypt and North Africa during the Egyptian and North African Neolithic Revolution and bringing agriculture to the region. Tell el-&#x27;Oueili is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period, around 5400 BC, and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period. In the south, the Ubaid period lasted from around 6500 to 3800 BC.

Sumerian civilization coalesced in the subsequent Uruk period (4000 to 3100 BC). Named after the Sumerian city of Uruk, this period saw the emergence of urban life in Mesopotamia and, during its later phase, the gradual emergence of the cuneiform script. Proto-writing in the region dates to around 3800 BC, with the earliest texts dating to 3300 BC; early cuneiform writing emerged in 3000 BC. It was also during this period that pottery painting declined as copper started to become popular, along with cylinder seals. Sumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were most likely headed by a priest-king (&quot;ensi&quot;), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women. It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure.

The Jemdet Nasr period, which is generally dated from 3100 to 2900 BC and succeeds the Uruk period, is known as one of the formative stages in the development of the cuneiform script. The oldest clay tablets come from Uruk and date to the late fourth millennium BC, slightly earlier than the Jemdet Nasr Period. By the time of the Jemdet Nasr Period, the script had already undergone a number of significant changes. It originally consisted of pictographs, but by the time of the Jemdet Nasr Period it was already adopting simpler and more abstract designs. It is also during this period that the script acquired its iconic wedge-shaped appearance.

Uruk trade networks started to expand to other parts of Mesopotamia and as far as North Caucasus, and strong signs of governmental organization and social stratification began to emerge, leading to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900 BC). After the Early Dynastic period began, there was a shift in control of the city-states from the temple establishment headed by council of elders led by a priestly &quot;En&quot; (a male figure when it was a temple for a goddess, or a female figure when headed by a male god) towards a more secular Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great). The Lugals included such legendary patriarchal figures as Enmerkar, Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh, who supposedly reigned shortly before the historic record opens around 2700 BC, when syllabic writing started to develop from the early pictograms. The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas. Neighboring Semitic groups, including the Akkadian speaking Semites (Assyrians, Babylonians) who lived alongside the Sumerians in Mesopotamia, adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own. The earliest ziggurats began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period, although architectural precursors in the form of raised platforms date back to the Ubaid period. The Sumerian King List dates to the early second millennium BC. It consists of a succession of royal dynasties from different Sumerian cities, ranging back into the Early Dynastic Period. Each dynasty rises to prominence and dominates the region, only to be replaced by the next. The document was used by later Mesopotamian kings to legitimize their rule. While some of the information in the list can be checked against other texts such as economic documents, much of it is probably purely fictional, and its use as a historical document is limited.

Eannatum, the Sumerian king of Lagash, established the first verifiable empire in history in 2500 BC. The neighboring Elam, in modern Iran, was also part of the early urbanization during the Chalcolithic period. Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the Ancient Near East. The emergence of Elamite written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, where slightly earlier records have been found. During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC. The Semitic-speaking Akkadian empire emerged around 2350 BC under Sargon the Great. The Akkadian Empire reached its political peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. Under Sargon and his successors, the Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as Elam and Gutium. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire and the overthrow of the Gutians, there was a brief reassertion of Sumerian dominance in Mesopotamia under the Third Dynasty of Ur. After the final collapse of Sumerian hegemony in Mesopotamia around 2004 BC, the Semitic Akkadian people of Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major Akkadian-speaking nations: Assyria in the north (whose earliest kings date to the 25th century BC), and, a few centuries later, Babylonia in the south, both of which (Assyria in particular) would go on to form powerful empires between the 20th and 6th centuries BC. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Semitic Assyrian-Babylonian population.

====Ancient Egypt====
 

The developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (10,200 BC) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7600 to 6000 BC) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards. Contemporaneously, a grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunters, fishers, and gathering people using stone tools along the Nile. Geological evidence and computer climate modeling studies also suggest that natural climate changes around 8000 BC began to desiccate the extensive pastoral lands of northern Africa, eventually forming the Sahara. Continued desiccation forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. The oldest fully developed neolithic culture in Egypt is Fayum A culture that began around 5500 B.C.

By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of inter-related cultures as far south as Sudan, demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in northern Upper Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and use of copper. The oldest known domesticated bovine in Africa are from Fayum dating to around 4400 BC. The Badari cultures was followed by the Naqada culture, which brought a number of technological improvements. As early as the first Naqada Period, Amratia, Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes. By 3300 BC, just before the first Egyptian dynasty, Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, known as Upper Egypt to the south, and Lower Egypt to the north.

Egyptian civilization begins during the second phase of the Naqada culture, known as the Gerzeh period, around 3500 BC and coalesces with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt around 3150 BC. Farming produced the vast majority of food; with increased food supplies, the populace adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle, and the larger settlements grew to cities of about 5,000 residents. It was in this time that the city dwellers started using mud brick to build their cities, and the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect became popular. Copper instead of stone was increasingly used to make tools and weaponry. Symbols on Gerzean pottery also resemble nascent Egyptian hieroglyphs. Early evidence also exists of contact with the Near East, particularly Canaan and the Byblos coast, during this time. Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt, also underwent a unification process. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule.
The Early Dynastic Period of Egypt immediately followed the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Naqada III archaeological period until about the beginning of the Old Kingdom, c. 2686 BC. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Thinis to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by a god-king. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labor, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.

Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the subsequent Old Kingdom, fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration. Some of ancient Egypt&#x27;s crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order. Along with the rising importance of a central administration there arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.

===Ancient India===


One of the earliest Neolithic sites in the Indian subcontinent is Bhirrana along the ancient Ghaggar-Hakra riverine system in the present day state of Haryana in India, dating to around 7600 BC. Other early sites include Lahuradewa in the Middle Ganges region and Jhusi near the confluence of Ganges and Yamuna rivers, both dating to around 7000 BC.

The aceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh in present-day Pakistan lasts from 7000 to 5500 BC, with the ceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasting up to 3300 BC; blending into the Early Bronze Age. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in the Indian subcontinent. It is likely that the culture centered around Mehrgarh migrated into the Indus Valley in present-day Pakistan and became the Indus Valley Civilisation. The earliest fortified town in the region is found at Rehman Dheri, dated 4000 BC in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa close to River Zhob Valley in present-day Pakistan . Other fortified towns found to date are at Amri (3600–3300 BC), Kot Diji in Sindh, and at Kalibangan (3000 BC) at the Hakra River.

The Indus Valley Civilization starts around 3300 BC with what is referred to as the Early Harappan Phase (3300 to 2600 BC), although at the start this was still a village-based culture, leaving mostly pottery for archaeologists. The earliest examples of the Indus script date to this period, as well as the emergence of citadels representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life. Trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including lapis lazuli and other materials for bead-making. By around 2600 BC, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, dates, and cotton, as well as animals, including the water buffalo.

2600 to 1900 BC marks the Mature Harappan Phase during which Early Harappan communities turned into large urban centers including Harappa, Dholavira, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Rupar, and Rakhigarhi, and more than 1,000 towns and villages, often of relatively small size. Mature Harappans evolved new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin and displayed advanced levels of engineering. As seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and the recently partially excavated Rakhigarhi, this urban plan included the world&#x27;s first known urban sanitation systems: see hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley civilization. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes. The housebuilding in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the housebuilding of the Harappans. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts.

The people of the Indus Civilization achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. A comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the Indus territories. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in Lothal in Gujarat, was approximately 1.704 mm, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the Bronze Age. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weights. These chert weights were in a ratio of 5:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28 grams, similar to the English Imperial ounce or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871. However, as in other cultures, actual weights were not uniform throughout the area. The weights and measures later used in Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; (4th century BC) are the same as those used in Lothal.

Around 1800 BC, signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BC most of the cities had been abandoned. Suggested contributory causes for the localisation of the IVC include changes in the course of the river, and climate change that is also signalled for the neighbouring areas of the Middle East. many scholars believe that drought led to a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia contributing to the collapse of the Indus Civilization. The Ghaggar-Hakra system was rain-fed, and water-supply depended on the monsoons. The Indus Valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800 BC, linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time. The Indian monsoon declined and aridity increased, with the Ghaggar-Hakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the Himalaya, leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable. Aridification reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilization&#x27;s demise, and to scatter its population eastward. As the monsoons kept shifting south, the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities. The residents then migrated away into smaller communities. However trade with the old cities did not flourish. The small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow development of trade, and the cities died out. The Indo-Aryan peoples migrated into the Indus River Valley during this period and began the Vedic age of India. The Indus Valley Civilization did not disappear suddenly and many elements of the civilization continued in later Indian subcontinent and Vedic cultures.

===Ancient China===

Drawing on archaeology, geology and anthropology, modern scholars do not see the origins of the Chinese civilization or history as a linear story but rather the history of the interactions of different and distinct cultures and ethnic groups that influenced each other&#x27;s development. The specific cultural regions that developed Chinese civilization were the Yellow River civilization, the Yangtze civilization, and Liao civilization. Early evidence for Chinese millet agriculture is dated to around 7000 BC, with the earliest evidence of cultivated rice found at Chengtoushan near the Yangtze River, dated to 6500 BC. Chengtoushan may also be the site of the first walled city in China. By the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution, the Yellow River valley began to establish itself as a center of the Peiligang culture, which flourished from 7000 to 5000 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead. With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators. Its most prominent site is Jiahu. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (6600 BC) are the earliest form of proto-writing in China. However, it is likely that they should not be understood as writing itself, but as features of a lengthy period of sign-use, which led eventually to a fully-fledged system of writing. Archaeologists believe that the Peiligang culture was egalitarian, with little political organization.

It eventually evolved into the Yangshao culture (5000 to 3000 BC), and their stone tools were polished and highly specialized. They may also have practiced an early form of silkworm cultivation. The main food of the Yangshao people was millet, with some sites using foxtail millet and others broomcorn millet, though some evidence of rice has been found. The exact nature of Yangshao agriculture, small-scale slash-and-burn cultivation versus intensive agriculture in permanent fields, is currently a matter of debate. Once the soil was exhausted, residents picked up their belongings, moved to new lands, and constructed new villages. However, Middle Yangshao settlements such as Jiangzhi contain raised-floor buildings that may have been used for the storage of surplus grains. Grinding stones for making flour were also found.

Later, Yangshao culture was superseded by the Longshan culture, which was also centered on the Yellow River from about 3000 to 1900 BC, its most prominent site being Taosi. The population expanded dramatically during the 3rd millennium BC, with many settlements having rammed earth walls. It decreased in most areas around 2000 BC until the central area evolved into the Bronze Age Erlitou culture. The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the Majiayao culture site (3100 to 2700 BC).

Chinese civilization begins during the second phase of the Erlitou period (1900 to 1500 BC), with Erlitou considered the first state level society of East Asia. There is considerable debate whether Erlitou sites correlate to the semi-legendary Xia dynasty. The Xia dynasty (2070 to 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient Chinese historical records such as the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, first published more than a millennium later during the Western Zhou period. Although Xia is an important element in Chinese historiography, there is to date no contemporary written evidence to corroborate the dynasty. Erlitou saw an increase in bronze metallurgy and urbanization and was a rapidly growing regional center with palatial complexes that provide evidence for social stratification. The Erlitou civilization is divided into four phases, each of roughly 50 years. During Phase I, covering , Erlitou was a rapidly growing regional center with estimated population of several thousand but not yet an urban civilization or capital. Urbanization began in Phase II, expanding to with a population around 11,000. A palace area of was demarcated by four roads. It contained the 150x50 m Palace 3, composed of three courtyards along a 150-meter axis, and Palace 5. A bronze foundry was established to the south of the palatial complex that was controlled by the elite who lived in palaces. The city reached its peak in Phase III, and may have had a population of around 24,000. The palatial complex was surrounded by a two-meter-thick rammed-earth wall, and Palaces 1, 7, 8, 9 were built. The earthwork volume of rammed earth for the base of largest Palace 1 is 20,000 m³ at least. Palaces 3 and 5 were abandoned and replaced by Palace 2 and Palace 4. In Phase IV, the population decreased to around 20,000, but building continued. Palace 6 was built as an extension of Palace 2, and Palaces 10 and 11 were built. Phase IV overlaps with the Lower phase of the Erligang culture (1600–1450 BC). Around 1600 to 1560 BC, about 6 km northeast of Erlitou, a culturally Erligang walled city was built at Yanshi, which coincides with an increase in production of arrowheads at Erlitou. This situation might indicate that the Yanshi city was competing for power and dominance with Erlitou. Production of bronzes and other elite goods ceased at the end of Phase IV, at the same time as the Erligang city of Zhengzhou was established to the east. There is no evidence of destruction by fire or war, but, during the Upper Erligang phase (1450–1300 BC), all the palaces were abandoned, and Erlitou was reduced to a village of .

The earliest traditional Chinese dynasty for which there is both archeological and written evidence is the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BC). Shang sites have yielded the earliest known body of Chinese writing, the oracle bone script, mostly divinations inscribed on bones. These inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of Chinese civilization. Some historians argue that Erlitou should be considered an early phase of the Shang dynasty. The U.S. National Gallery of Art defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the period between about 2000 and 771 BC; a period that begins with the Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of Western Zhou rule. The Sanxingdui culture is another Chinese Bronze Age society, contemporaneous to the Shang dynasty, however they developed a different method of bronze-making from the Shang.

===Ancient Andes===

The earliest evidence of agriculture in the Andean region dates to around 9000 BC in Ecuador at sites of the Las Vegas culture. The bottle gourd may have been the first plant cultivated. The oldest evidence of canal irrigation in South America dates to 4700 to 2500 BC in the Zaña Valley of northern Peru. The earliest urban settlements of the Andes, as well as North and South America, are dated to 3500 BC at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area, and Sechin Bajo near the Sechin River. Both sites are in Peru.

The Caral–Supe or Norte Chico civilization is understood to have emerged around 3200 BC, as it is at that point that large-scale human settlement and communal construction across multiple sites becomes clearly apparent. In the early 21st century, Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Shady established Caral–Supe as the oldest known civilization in the Americas. The civilization flourished near the Pacific coast in the valleys of three small rivers, the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters of sites. Further south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River. Notable settlements include the cities of Caral, the largest and most complex Preceramic site, and Aspero. Norte Chico is distinguished by its density of large sites with immense architecture. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.

Norte Chico is unusual in that it completely lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. Nevertheless, the civilization exhibited impressive architectural feats, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas, and an advanced textile industry. The platform mounds, as well as large stone warehouses, provide evidence for a stratified society and a centralized authority necessary to distribute resources such as cotton. However, there is no evidence of warfare or defensive structures during this period. Originally, it was theorized that, unlike other early civilizations, Norte Chico developed by relying on maritime food sources in place of a staple cereal. This hypothesis, the Maritime Foundation of Andean Civilization, is still hotly debated; however, most researches now agree that agriculture played a central role in the civilization&#x27;s development while still acknowledging a strong supplemental reliance on maritime proteins.

The Norte Chico chiefdoms were &quot;...almost certainly theocratic, though not brutally so,&quot; according to Mann. Construction areas show possible evidence of feasting, which would have included music and likely alcohol, suggesting an elite able to both mobilize and reward the population. The degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain, but architectural construction patterns are indicative of an elite that, at least in certain places at certain times, wielded considerable power: while some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral, appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases. As further evidence of centralized control, Haas points to remains of large stone warehouses found at Upaca, on the Pativilca, as emblematic of authorities able to control vital resources such as cotton. Economic authority would have rested on the control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that the scope of this economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were at the center of a broad regional trade network centered on these resources.

&quot;Discover&quot; magazine, citing Shady, suggests a rich and varied trade life: &quot;[Caral] exported its own products and those of Aspero to distant communities in exchange for exotic imports: &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells from the coast of Ecuador, rich dyes from the Andean highlands, hallucinogenic snuff from the Amazon.&quot; (Given the still limited extent of Norte Chico research, such claims should be treated circumspectly.) Other reports on Shady&#x27;s work indicate Caral traded with communities in the Andes and in the jungles of the Amazon basin on the opposite side of the Andes.

Leaders&#x27; ideological power was based on apparent access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: an image of the Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers. The act of architectural construction and maintenance may also have been a spiritual or religious experience: a process of communal exaltation and ceremony. Shady has called Caral &quot;the sacred city&quot; (&quot;la ciudad sagrada&quot;): socio-economic and political focus was on the temples, which were periodically remodeled, with major burnt offerings associated with the remodeling.

Bundles of strings uncovered at Norte Chico sites have been identified as quipu, a type of pre-writing recording device. Quipu are thought to encode numeric information, but some have conjectured that quipu have been used to encode other forms of data, possibly including literary or musical applications. However, the exact use of quipu by the Norte Chico and later Andean cultures has been widely debated. The presence of quipu and the commonality of religious symbols suggests a cultural link between Norte Chico and later Andean cultures.

Circa 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. Pottery eventually developed in the Amazon Basin and spread to the Andean culture region around 2000 BC. The next major civilization to arise in the Andes would be the Chavín culture at Chavín de Huantar, located in the Andean highlands of the present-day Ancash Region. It is believed to have been built around 900 BC and was the religious and political center of the Chavín people.

===Mesoamerica===


Maize is believed to have been first domesticated in southern Mexico about 7000 BC. The Coxcatlan Caves in the Valley of Tehuacán provide evidence for agriculture in components dated between 5000 and 3400 BC. Similarly, sites such as Sipacate in Guatemala provide maize pollen samples dating to 3500 BC. Around 1900 BC, the Mokaya domesticated one of the dozen species of cacao. A Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating to this time. The Mokaya are also thought to have been among the first cultures in Mesoamerica to develop a hierarchical society. What would become the Olmec civilization had its roots in early farming cultures of Tabasco, which began around 5100 to 4600 BC.

The emergence of the Olmec civilization has traditionally been dated to around 1600 to 1500 BC. Olmec features first emerged in the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, fully coalescing around 1400 BC. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos River basin. This environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class and an associated demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The aspect of Olmec culture perhaps most familiar today is their artwork, particularly the Olmec colossal heads. San Lorenzo was situated in the midst of a large agricultural area. San Lorenzo seems to have been largely a ceremonial site, a town without city walls, centered in the midst of a widespread medium-to-large agricultural population. The ceremonial center and attendant buildings could have housed 5,500 while the entire area, including hinterlands, could have reached 13,000. It is thought that while San Lorenzo controlled much or all of the Coatzacoalcos basin, areas to the east (such as the area where La Venta would rise to prominence) and north-northwest (such as the Tuxtla Mountains) were home to independent polities. San Lorenzo was all but abandoned around 900 BC at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred 950 BC, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion. The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.

La Venta became the cultural capital of the Olmec concentration in the region until its abandonment around 400 BC; constructing monumental architectural achievements such as the Great Pyramid of La Venta. It contained a &quot;concentration of power&quot;, as reflected by the sheer enormity of the architecture and the extreme value of the artifacts uncovered. La Venta is perhaps the largest Olmec city and it was controlled and expanded by an extremely complex hierarchical system with a king, as the ruler and the elites below him. Priests had power and influence over life and death and likely great political sway as well. Unfortunately, not much is known about the political or social structure of the Olmec, though new dating techniques might, at some point, reveal more information about this elusive culture. It is possible that the signs of status exist in the artifacts recovered at the site such as depictions of feathered headdresses or of individuals wearing a mirror on their chest or forehead. &quot;High-status objects were a significant source of power in the La Venta polity political power, economic power, and ideological power. They were tools used by the elite to enhance and maintain rights to rulership&quot;. It has been estimated that La Venta would need to be supported by a population of at least 18,000 people during its principal occupation. To add to the mystique of La Venta, the alluvial soil did not preserve skeletal remains, so it is difficult to observe differences in burials. However, colossal heads provide proof that the elite had some control over the lower classes, as their construction would have been extremely labor-intensive. &quot;Other features similarly indicate that many laborers were involved&quot;. In addition, excavations over the years have discovered that different parts of the site were likely reserved for elites and other parts for non-elites. This segregation of the city indicates that there must have been social classes and therefore social inequality.

The exact cause of the decline of the Olmec culture is uncertain. Between 400 and 350 BC, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously. This depopulation was probably the result of serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers, in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by tectonic upheavals or subsidence, or the silting up of rivers due to agricultural practices. Within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BC, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some 550 km (330 miles) to the southeast.

The Olmecs are sometimes referred to as the mother culture of Mesoamerica, as they were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed. However, the causes and degree of Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades. Practices introduced by the Olmec include ritual bloodletting and the Mesoamerican ballgame; hallmarks of subsequent Mesoamerican societies such as the Maya and Aztec. Although the Mesoamerican writing system would fully develop later, early Olmec ceramics show representations that may be interpreted as codices.

==Cradle of Western civilization==

The origins of Western civilization can be traced back to the ancient Mediterranean world. There is academic consensus that Classical Greece was a major culture that provided the foundation of modern Western culture, philosophy, democracy, art, science, aesthetics, theatre, as well as building designs and proportions and architecture.

Along with Greece, Ancient Rome has sometimes been described as a birthplace or as the cradle of Western Civilization because of the role the city had in politics, republicanism, law, architecture, warfare and Western Christianity.

Western Civilization is also closely associated with Christianity, the predominant religion in the West, which has its origins in Judaism—the ethnic religion of the Jewish people—and Greco-Roman philosophy. Christianity emerged as a sect within Judaism and inherited many of its foundational beliefs, scriptures, and ethical principles from Jewish tradition. Christian ethics, influenced by its Jewish roots, has significantly influenced the foundational principles of Western societies.

The blending of Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian traditions in shaping Western civilization has led scholars to describe it as emerging from the legacies of Athens and Jerusalem, or Athens, Jerusalem, and Rome.

==Other uses==
The phrase &quot;cradle of civilization&quot;... plays a certain role in national mysticism. It has been used in Eastern as well as Western cultures, for instance, in Indian nationalism (&quot;In Search of the Cradle of Civilization&quot; 1995) and Taiwanese nationalism (&quot;Taiwan;— The Cradle of Civilization&quot; 2002). The terms also appear in esoteric pseudohistory, such as the Urantia Book, claiming the title for &quot;the second Eden&quot;, or the pseudoarchaeology related to Megalithic Britain (&quot;Civilization One&quot; 2004,
&quot;Ancient Britain: The Cradle of Civilization&quot; 1921).

==Timeline==

The following timeline shows a timeline of cultures, with the approximate dates of the emergence of civilization (as discussed in the article) in the featured areas, the primary cultures associated with these early civilizations. It is important to note that the timeline is not indicative of the beginning of human habitation, the start of a specific ethnic group, or the development of Neolithic cultures in the area – any of which often occurred significantly earlier than the emergence of civilization proper.

The dates given are only approximate as the development of civilization was incremental and the exact date when &quot;civilization&quot; began for a given culture is subject to interpretation.

<text>Princess Thyra of Denmark (Thyra Amalie Caroline Charlotte Anna; 29 September 1853 – 26 February 1933) was the youngest daughter and fifth child of Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. In 1878, she married Ernest Augustus, the exiled heir to the Kingdom of Hanover. As the Kingdom of Hanover had been annexed by Prussia in 1866, she spent most of her life in exile with her husband in Austria.

Thyra was the sister of King Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, King George I of Greece, Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia and Prince Valdemar of Denmark.

==Birth and family==

Thyra was born on 29 September 1853 at the Yellow Palace, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen. She was the third daughter and fifth child of Prince Christian and Princess Louise of Denmark. As a child, she shared a bedroom with her elder sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, and was taught how to sew and knit her own clothes and socks. Her family had been relatively obscure but happy until her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen with the consent of the great powers to succeed his childless distant cousin, Frederick VII, to the Danish throne. Just two months before Thyra&#x27;s birth, the new Act of Succession had been passed and Prince Christian was given the title of Prince of Denmark.

== Early life ==

 In 1863, when Thyra was 10 years old, King Frederick VII died, and her father succeeded to the throne of Denmark as King Christian IX. Earlier the same year, her brother Vilhelm had been elected King of Greece, and her sister Alexandra had married Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. In 1866, her other sister Dagmar married the Tsarevich of Russia, Alexander. Princess Thyra was confirmed on 27 May 1870 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen.

In 1871, at 18 years of age, Thyra had an affair with Vilhelm Frimann Marcher, a lieutenant in the cavalry, which resulted in a pregnancy. To avoid scandal, Thyra fled to Greece to be with her brother, George I of Greece. When her father Christian IX learned that Thyra was &quot;unwell&quot;, from the Greek media, he rushed to Greece to be with her. When Thyra gave birth in Athens, the baby was immediately given up for adoption. The Danish press was told Thyra had been taken ill with jaundice.

Thyra was an attractive and gentle young woman, with dark hair and dark blue eyes, and Queen Louise wanted her youngest daughter to make a good marriage as her elder daughters had. Thyra&#x27;s first suitor was King William III of the Netherlands, but as he was thirty-six years older than she was, she rejected him.

==Marriage==
During a family visit to Germany in 1878, Louise and Alexandra left, saying that they were going to attend an optician consultation. However, they were actually arranging a meeting between Thyra and Ernest Augustus of Hanover, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Ernest Augustus was the eldest child and only son of the exiled King George V of Hanover and his wife, Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. Thyra wrote in her journal that she was &quot;very excited&quot; to meet the Crown Prince. Ernest Augustus had been born as a Crown Prince of Hanover, but in 1866 his father had been deprived of his throne, when the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia after siding with Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. Ernest Augustus had Cumberland Castle in Gmunden, Austria, built in 1882 as exile seat. Despite this, Thyra wrote that she believed Ernest Augustus would one day ascend the Hanoverian throne.
Upon meeting, Thyra&#x27;s hand was immediately kissed by Ernest Augustus, while Alexandra peeked from around the corner. After some time, Thyra proposed to Ernest Augustus. While Thyra&#x27;s family was excited, Queen Victoria stated that her engagement was &quot;completely without foundation&quot; after failing to marry off one of her own sons to Thyra. In December 1878, Thyra married Ernest Augustus at the Chapel Royal of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen.
==Later life==
After the wedding, the couple took up residence in Gmunden, Upper Austria, where Thyra lived for the rest of her life at the large Schloss Cumberland. They also had a townhouse in Vienna. The couple had six children, three sons and three daughters.

Her husband died on 14 November 1923. Thyra survived him by nine years and died in Gmunden, Upper Austria, on 26 February 1933.

==Issue==

The Duke and Duchess of Cumberland and Teviotdale had six children:

<text>The Bulls (known for sponsorship reasons as the [[Vodacom]] Bulls) are a South African professional rugby union team based in Pretoria. They play their home matches at Loftus Versfeld. They compete in the United Rugby Championship, having competed in the Super Rugby competition until 2020. Prior to 1998, the Bulls competed in the then-Super 12 as Northern Transvaal, as in those years South Africa was represented in the competition by its top four Currie Cup sides from the previous season, instead of the modern Super Rugby teams.

The side won the Super 14 in 2007, 2009 and 2010, placing them among the most successful teams in Super Rugby history with three titles. They were the most successful team of the Super 14 era (2006–10), winning three out of the five titles. They are the most successful South African team, and the only South African team to win a Super Rugby title.

The Currie Cup team has been seen playing as the Bulls and not the Blue Bulls since the 2020-21 season. This is a move to rebrand all the teams under one name and not only the Bulls rebranded their Currie Cup name but the Sharks and Lions also modified their names. 

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Prior to the professional Super Rugby competition, Northern Transvaal competed in the Super 10, which was a tournament featuring ten teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tonga and Western Samoa, which ran from 1993 to 1995. The top three teams from the previous Currie Cup season qualified for each of the Super 10 tournaments.

Northern Transvaal competed in the 1993 season, where they were grouped in Pool B alongside Transvaal, New South Wales, North Harbour and Waikato. Transvaal finished at the top of the pool, with Northern Transvaal finishing third, behind New South Wales. Northern Transvaal did not qualify for the Super 10 (Southern Hemisphere competition)#1994 Super 10 or 1995 seasons.

=== Early Professional Era (1996–2005) ===
After rugby union went professional, the Super 10 tournament was restructured. The Super 12 was created, and was to be competed by teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Both Australia and New Zealand adopted new franchise models for their teams, whereas South Africa chose to use the Currie Cup to decide what teams were to be promoted in the Super 12 each season.

Competing in the inaugural Super 12 season of 1996, Northern Transvaal were one of the 12 teams. The side won eight of their 11 games and finished third on the table – behind only Auckland and Queensland. Jannie Kruger finished the season in the top three leading point-scorers, behind only Matt Burke and John Eales. The side was however soundly defeated in a semi-final by the Auckland Blues, with the final score being 48 points to 11. The game was played at Eden Park in Auckland.

After their fairly successful performance in the opening competition, the subsequent competition of 1997 saw them with three wins and three draws from 11 games. They finished at eighth. Following the 1997 season, South Africa adopted a similar franchise system to that of Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s, abolishing the Currie Cup promotion system in favour of creating new franchises. The Bulls were formed as one of the four new teams. They did not make the semis in the 1998 season. The Bulls were considered one of the worst teams in the Super 12 competition, finishing last or second to last for five consecutive seasons from 1998 to 2003. In 2002, they became the first team ever to go through an entire Super Rugby season without winning a single game. This record remained until the Lions repeated the feat during the 2010 season. After finishing fourth in the inaugural competition, they did not make the semis again until the years 2003.

The Bulls finished in 6th place in both 2003 and 2004, though still missing out on a finals position. They equalled there 1996 performance in 2005, although there was a very poor start to the season, it was followed by six straight wins to earn them a semi-final berth, where they were defeated by the New South Wales Waratahs. Bryan Habana finished in the top three try-scorers by the end of the season, and was short-listed for IRB player of the year.

=== Super 14 Era (2006–10) ===

In 2006, the Super 12 became the Super 14, with the addition of two new franchises, the Cheetahs and the Western Force. By the last round of the 2006 season, the Bulls, along with the Brumbies and Sharks were all in contention to take the fourth and final position on the ladder to make the semi-finals. After the Brumbies were defeated 33 to 3 by the Crusaders, the Bulls or Sharks could mathematically take the fourth spot. The Bulls defeated the Stormers at Newlands in Cape Town 43 points to 10, which ensured they went through to the semi-finals. The Bulls travelled to Christchurch where they were defeated 35 to 15 at Jade Stadium and knocked out of the finals.

The Bulls lost their first game of the 2007 Super 14 season, going down to the Sharks in Durban 17 points to 3. Entering week 14, the last round of the regular season, the Bulls were chasing an unlikely 72-point win over the Queensland Reds in order to move into second place and get a home semi-final. At Loftus, the Bulls defeated the Reds 92 points to 3, with the 89-point margin of victory setting a new Super rugby record. The Bulls ran in 13 tries with four players getting doubles and Derick Hougaard kicking 11 conversions. The Sharks finished first, so it became the first time that both home venues in the semi-finals was in South Africa.

The Bulls defeated the Crusaders in their semi-final by 27 points to 12, with Derick Hougaard kicking eight penalties and a drop-goal. The Sharks ensured a home-final in the 2007 Super 14-competition by defeating the Blues with a scoreline of 34–18.

When the Bulls met the Sharks in the Super 14 final at the Absa Stadium in Durban the match turned out to be a tight, nervous affair with the Bulls initially being guilty of indiscipline and making a lot of mistakes. The Sharks carried a 14–10 advantage into half-time after a JP Pietersen try cancelled out one from Pierre Spies. The second half of the match was just as nail-biting, with the Bulls gaining the ascendancy in the match, but failing to turn their rising amount of possession into points. A Derick Hougaard penalty closed the gap to 14–13, after which the Bulls made several onslaughts on the Sharks line, only to lose the ball at critical stages. Their match looked to be all but over for the Bulls when Albert van den Berg barged over the line for a Sharks try two minutes from full-time to stretch their lead to six points. However, François Steyn failed with the conversion attempt, and the Bulls restarted with barely seconds on the clock. After regaining the ball from the kick-off, play went through several phases before Bryan Habana received the ball on the right wing. He cut infield and scored the most dramatic of match winning tries, more than a minute after official play. The try was converted by Derick Hougaard and the Bulls won the match 20–19. In 2009 the Bulls again won the Super 14, defeating the Chiefs 61 – 17 in the final in Pretoria.

In 2010 the Bulls again finished top of the log by beating the Crusaders in a home semi final to secure a home final. Because the FIFA World Cup was being hosted by South Africa that year and Loftus was included as a venue, they had to play the semi and final in Soweto, a first in Super Rugby history. The Stormers had beaten the Waratahs at home and would face off with the Bulls in the Final. The Bulls won the final once again in dramatic style when Francois Hougaard sidestepped the Stormers fullback Joe Petersen to score an impressive try.

=== Super Rugby Era (2011–2020) ===
The Bulls only managed the Super Rugby South African Conference trophy in 2013 and they were three time conference runner-up in 2012, 2014 and 2019. They also reached the Qualifiers twice and Semi-final once but lost all three play-off matches.

After the 2020 Super Rugby season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a replacement tournament was announced for each country. The South African tournament was called Super Rugby Unlocked and the Bulls were crowned the champions after ending top of the log.

The South African teams withdrew from the competition entirely, making the Bulls the only South African winners of any form of the Super Rugby trophy.

=== Pro14 and United Rugby Championship Era (2021–present) ===

The Pro14 Rainbow Cup was announced as an end-of-season cup competition to introduce the South African teams after their withdrawal from Super Rugby. After the regular season the top of the South African log Bulls faced European top Benetton in the final in Italy. The Bulls lost their first match in Europe as well as the Pro14 Rainbow Cup final 35–8.

The 2021–22 season was a tough start for the Bulls with two straight losses in Europe against Leinster 31-3 and Connacht 34–7. The Bulls got their first win in Europe on 9 October 2021 beating Cardiff Blues 29–19.

They went on to finish in 4th place on the overall standings after regular season, securing a home quarter-final.

== Location ==

The team is centred around the Blue Bulls Rugby Union, whose catchment covers Pretoria as well as Limpopo, but also draws players from the Falcons Rugby Union, who represent the East Rand. Through 2005, the Bulls also drew players from the Pumas Rugby Union and Leopards Rugby Union, but in the realignment of franchise areas that came from the expansion of Super 12 to Super 14, these unions were moved into the Lions.

== Stadium ==
The Bulls play all their home matches at the Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria, which is also the home of the Blue Bulls during the Currie Cup season. The stadium is also a regular host for Springboks Test matches, and was a venue during the 1995 Rugby World Cup which South Africa hosted. Loftus was a venue for Pool D matches including France v Tonga, Scotland v Tonga and France v Scotland. Loftus was also used twice during the finals stages – for the New Zealand v Scotland quarter-final and the England v France third place play-off.

The ground has been used for rugby since 1908, and in 1932 the stadium was renamed to Loftus Versfeld in honor of Robert Owen Loftus Versfeld, the founder of organized rugby in Pretoria. The stadium has undergone numerous renovations over the years, and is currently capable of holding 51,762 spectators.

== Primary sponsor ==
Since 2005, the team&#x27;s main sponsor has been mobile communications company Vodacom. On the team&#x27;s website and all team-issued press releases, the Bulls are referred to as the Vodacom Bulls.

<doc id="710793" wikidata="Q324076" url="?curid=710793" title="Dynorphin">
<text>Dynorphins (Dyn) are a class of opioid peptides that arise from the precursor protein prodynorphin. When prodynorphin is cleaved during processing by proprotein convertase 2 (PC2), multiple active peptides are released: dynorphin A, dynorphin B, and α/β-neoendorphin. Depolarization of a neuron containing prodynorphin stimulates PC2 processing, which occurs within synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Occasionally, prodynorphin is not fully processed, leading to the release of &quot;big dynorphin&quot;. &quot;Big dynorphin&quot; is a 32-amino acid molecule consisting of both dynorphin A and dynorphin B.

Dynorphin A, dynorphin B, and big dynorphin all contain a high proportion of basic amino acid residues, in particular lysine and arginine (29.4%, 23.1%, and 31.2% basic residues, respectively), as well as many hydrophobic residues (41.2%, 30.8%, and 34.4% hydrophobic residues, respectively). Although dynorphins are found widely distributed in the CNS, they have the highest concentrations in the hypothalamus, medulla, pons, midbrain, and spinal cord. Dynorphins are stored in large (80–120 nm diameter) dense-core vesicles that are considerably larger than vesicles storing neurotransmitters. These large dense-core vesicles differ from small synaptic vesicles in that a more intense and prolonged stimulus is needed to cause the large vesicles to release their contents into the synaptic cleft. Dense-core vesicle storage is characteristic of opioid peptides storage.

The first clues to the functionality of dynorphins came from Goldstein et al. in their work with opioid peptides. The group discovered an endogenous opioid peptide in the porcine pituitary that proved difficult to isolate. By sequencing the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, they created a synthetic version of the peptide with a similar potency to the natural peptide. Goldstein et al. applied the synthetic peptide to the guinea ileum longitudinal muscle and found it to be an extraordinarily potent opioid peptide. The peptide was called dynorphin (from the Greek &quot;dynamis&quot;, meaning power) to describe its potency.

Dynorphins exert their effects primarily through the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein-coupled receptor. Two subtypes of KORs have been identified: K1 and K2. Although KOR is the primary receptor for all dynorphins, the peptides do have some affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor. Different dynorphins show different receptor selectivities and potencies at receptors. Big dynorphin and dynorphin A have the same selectivity for human KOR, but dynorphin A is more selective for KOR over MOR and DOR than is big dynorphin. Big dynorphin is more potent at KORs than is dynorphin A. Both big dynorphin and dynorphin A are more potent and more selective than dynorphin B.

==Production==
Dynorphin is produced in many different parts of the nervous system, including the hypothalamus, the striatum, the hippocampus and the spinal cord. Gene expression patterns from the Allen Brain Atlases in mouse, macaque and humans can be seen here.

Dynorphin has many different physiological actions, depending upon its site of production.
* For example, dynorphin that is made in magnocellular vasopressin neurons of the supraoptic nucleus is important in the patterning of electrical activity. Dynorphin produced in magnocellular oxytocin neurons is a negative feedback inhibitor of oxytocin secretion.
* Dynorphin produced in the arcuate nucleus and in orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus affects the control of appetite.

==Analgesia==
Dynorphin has been shown to be a modulator of pain response. Han and Xie found that injecting dynorphin into the subarachnoid space of the rat spinal cord produced dose-dependent analgesia that was measured by tail-flick latency. Analgesia was partially eliminated by opioid antagonist naloxone.

Han and Xie found dynorphin to be 6-10 times more potent than morphine on a per mole basis. In addition, morphine tolerance did not reduce dynorphin-induced analgesia. Ren et al. demonstrated some of the complexities related to dynorphin induced analgesia. The authors found that combining subanalgesic levels of morphine and dynorphin A1-13, a version of dynorphin A containing only the first 13 amino acids of the peptide, in the rat spinal cord had additive effects. However, when dynorphin A1-13 was injected into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) region of the brain, it had an antagonist effect on morphine-induced analgesia.

A study by Lai et al. found that dynorphin might actually stimulate pain. The group found that it acts on the bradykinin receptor as well as KOR. The N-terminal tyrosine of dynorphin A is necessary to activate opioid receptors such as KOR, but is unnecessary in binding to bradykinin receptors. Lai et al. studied the effects of dynorphin A2-13 that did not contain the N-terminal tyrosine. Based on the results of dynorphin A2-13, the authors proposed a mechanism in which dynorphin A activates bradykinin receptors and thus stimulates pain response.

According to this mechanism, dynorphin activates bradykinin receptors, which triggers the release of calcium ions into the cell through voltage-sensitive channels in the cell membrane. Blocking bradykinin receptors in the lumbar region of the spinal cord reversed persistent pain. A multiple pathway system might help explain the conflicting effects of dynorphin in the CNS.

Svensson et al. provided another possible mechanism by which dynorphin might cause pain in the spinal cord. The authors found that administration of truncated dynorphin A2-17, which does not bind to opioid receptors, causes an increase in phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in microglia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activated p38 has been previously linked to the NMDA-evoked prostaglandin release, which causes pain. Thus, dynorphin could also induce pain in the spinal cord through a non-opioid p38 pathway.

Other studies have identified a role for dynorphin and kappa opioid receptor stimulation in neuropathic pain. This same group also showed that the dynorphin-KOR system mediates astrocyte proliferation through the activation of p38 MAPK that was required for the effects of neuropathic pain on analgesic responses. Taken together, these reports suggest that dynorphin can elicit multiple effects on both Kappa opioid, and non-opioid pathways to modulate analgesic responses.

==Addiction==
Cocaine addiction results from complex molecular changes in the brain following multiple exposures to cocaine. Dynorphins have been shown to be an important part of this process. Although a single exposure to cocaine does not affect brain dynorphin levels, repeated exposures to the drug increases dynorphin concentrations in the striatum and substantia nigra in rats.

One proposed molecular mechanism for increased dynorphin levels involves transcriptional regulation by CREB (3’, 5’-monophosphate response element binding protein). According to the model proposed by Carlezon et al., use of cocaine increases the expression of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA leads to the activation of CREB, which increases the expression of dynorphin in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, brain areas important in addiction. Dynorphin decreases dopamine release by binding to KORs on dopamine nerve terminals.

=== Cocaine ===

Carlezon et al. performed several experiments to validate this model. They found that, when mice were injected with cocaine, they preferred to be in the place where they were injected (showed stronger place preference) significantly more than control mice (injected with saline) did. However, in mice overexpressing CREB under a constitutive promoter, place aversion was observed. This indicates that increasing CREB reverses the positive effects of cocaine. Northern blot analysis several days after CREB overexpression showed a marked increase in dynorphin mRNA in the nucleus accumbens.

Blocking KORs with an antagonist (norBNI) blocked the aversive effects caused by CREB overexpression. Thus, cocaine use ultimately appears to lead to an increase in the transcription of prodynorphin mRNA. Dynorphin inhibits dopamine release, which could account the reinforcing properties of cocaine.

There is also evidence suggesting that increased amounts of dynorphin can protect humans from cocaine addiction. According to research at Rockefeller University, the gene for dynorphin is present in two versions: a “high output” and a “low output” functional variation. The high output functional variation of the gene contains polymorphisms in the promoter regions that are speculated to cause it to produce more copies of dynorphin mRNA, which would give people carrying this variation a “built-in defense system” against drug addiction.

==Stress and depression==
Land et al. first described a mechanism of dysphoria in which corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) provokes dynorphin release. While control mice displayed aversive behaviors in response to forced swim tests and foot shocks, mice lacking dynorphin did not show any such signs of aversion. They noted that injecting CRF led to aversive behaviors in mice with functional genes for dynorphin even in the absence of stress, but not in those with dynorphin gene deletions. Place aversion was eliminated when the receptor CRF2 was blocked with an antagonist.

Together these results led Land et al. to conclude that dysphoric elements of stress occur when CRF2 stimulates dynorphin release and activates KOR. The group further postulated that this pathway might be involved in drug seeking behavior. In support of this, it was shown previously that stress can reinstate cocaine-seeking behavior in mice through a CRF mechanism.

Dynorphin has also been shown to influence drug seeking behavior and is required for stress-induced, but not prime-induced, reinstatement of cocaine seeking. A downstream element of this pathway was later identified by Bruchas et al. The authors found that KOR activates p38, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, through phosphorylation. Activation of p38 is necessary to produce KOR-dependent behaviors.

Because of its role in mediating dysphoria, dynorphin has also been investigated in relation to depression. Newton et al. studied the effects of CREB and dynorphin on learned helplessness (an animal model for depression) in mice. Overexpression of dominant negative CREB (mCREB) in transgenic mice had an antidepressant effect (in terms of behavior), whereas overexpressing wild-type CREB caused an increase in depression-like symptoms. As described previously, CREB increases transcription of prodynorphin, which gives rise to different dynorphin subtypes. Newton et al. supported this mechanism, as the mCREB was colocalized with decreased expression of prodynorphin. Also, direct antagonism of dynorphin caused antidepressant-like effects similar to those seen with mCREB expression. Thus, the CREB-dynorphin pathway regulates mood as well as cocaine rewards.

Shirayama et al. used several animal depression models in rats to describe the effects of dynorphins A and B in depression. The authors found that learned helplessness increases the levels of dynorphins A and B in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens and that injecting KOR antagonist norBNI induces recovery from learned helplessness. Immobilization stress causes increases in the levels of both dynorphins A and B in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Forced swim stress increases the levels of dynorphin A in the hippocampus. Shirayama et al. concluded that both dynorphins A and B were important in stress response. The authors proposed several mechanisms to account for the effects of the KOR antagonist norBNI on learned helplessness. First, increased dynorphin levels block the release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in plasticity in the hippocampus, which would inhibit new learning.

Blocking dynorphin effects would allow glutamate to be released and restore functional plasticity in the hippocampus, reversing the phenomenon of learned helplessness. In addition, blocking dynorphin would enhance dopamine signaling and thus reduce depressive symptoms associated with stress. The authors suggest that KOR antagonists might have potential in treating depression in humans.

==Appetite and circadian rhythms==
Dynorphins are important in maintaining homeostasis through appetite control and circadian rhythms. Przewlocki et al. found that, during the day, dynorphins are naturally elevated in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary (NI pituitary) and depressed in the hypothalamus. This pattern is reversed at night. In addition, mice deprived of food and water, or of water alone, had increased levels of dynorphin in the hypothalamus during the day. Deprivation of water alone also decreased the dynorphin levels in the NI pituitary. These findings led Przewlocki et al. to conclude that dynorphins are essential in maintaining homeostasis.

Dynorphin has been implicated as an appetite stimulant. A number of studies in rats have shown that increasing the dynorphin levels stimulates eating. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, can reverse the effects of elevated dynorphin. This inhibition is especially strong in obese animals or animals that have access to particularly appealing food. Inui et al. found that administering dynorphin to dogs increased both their food and water intake.

Dynorphin plays a role in the eating behavior of hibernating animals. Nizeilski et al. examined dynorphin levels in the ground squirrel, which undergoes periods of excessive eating and periods of starvation before winter. They found that dynorphin levels increased during the starvation periods. Berman et al. studied the levels of dynorphin during periods of food restriction. The group found that while food did not alter the expression of dynorphin B, it increases dynorphin A levels in several rat brain regions (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis).

Recent research on dynorphin knockout mice did not find differences between knockout and control animals in food intake, but found that fat storage was reduced in male knockout mice. Fatty acids were oxidized more quickly in knockout animals.

Studies have also shown that ingesting a high-fat diet increases the gene expression of dynorphin in the hypothalamus. Thus, dynorphin may cause overeating when a high-fat diet is available. Morley &amp; Levine were the first to describe the role of opioid peptides in stress-related eating. In their study, mice had their tails pinched (causes stress), which induced eating. Stress-related eating was reduced by injecting naloxone, an opioid peptide antagonist.

Mandenoff et al. proposed that, although endogenous opioids are not necessary to maintain body weight and energy expenditure under predictable circumstances, they become activated under stressful conditions. They found that endogenous opioids, such as dynorphin, stimulate appetite and decrease energy expenditure. Taken together, the studies above suggest an important evolutionary mechanism in which more food is eaten, more nutrients are stored, and less energy is expended by an organism during times of stress.

==Temperature regulation==
In addition to their role in weight control, dynorphins have been found to regulate body temperature. Opioid peptides were first investigated in hyperthermia, where it was found that MOR agonists stimulate this response when injected into the periaqueductal gray (PAG) region of the brain. Xin et al. showed that delivery of dynorphin A1-17 (a KOR agonist) through microdialysis into the PAG region induced hypothermia in rats. The authors found that the severity of hypothermia was proportional to the dose of dynorphin A1-17 administered. Hypothermia could be prevented by administering KOR antagonist norBNI to the rat. Xin et al. hypothesized that while MOR agonists mediate hyperthermia, KOR agonists, such as dynorphin, mediate hypothermia.

Sharma and Alm found that subjecting rats to heat (38˚C) caused dynorphins to be upregulated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and the brain stem. Further, authors found that administration of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors reduced dynorphin A1-17 levels in the brain and attenuated symptoms related to heat stress. Sharma and Alm concluded that hyperthermia increases dynorphin levels, which may cause damage and promote heat stress reaction. They further hypothesized that nitric oxide was part of this mechanism. Ansonoff et al. found that hypothermic effects are mediated through K1 (κ-opioid receptor 1), but not K2. The authors applied a KOR agonist to K1 knockout mice, which eliminated hypothermic response. Thus, K2 does not appear to have a role in the hypothermic mechanism.

==Clinical significance==
Dynorphin derivatives are generally considered to be of little clinical use because of their very short duration of action.

<doc id="710794" wikidata="Q1035160" url="?curid=710794" title="Hello Nasty">
<text>Hello Nasty is the fifth studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 14, 1998, by Grand Royal and Capitol Records. The album sold 681,000 copies in its first week, debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and won Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (for &quot;Intergalactic&quot;) at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. In &quot;Beastie Boys Book&quot; (2018), Ad-Rock said he felt &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; was the group&#x27;s &quot;best record&quot;.

==Background==
The album was released on July 14, 1998, just over four years after the previous Beastie Boys album, &quot;Ill Communication&quot;. It marked the addition of DMC champion Mix Master Mike to the group&#x27;s line-up, and was the last time the band worked with percussionist Eric Bobo or a co-producer. There are several guest vocalists on the album, including Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, and Jamaican dub musician Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry on &quot;Dr. Lee, PhD&quot;.

On the many musical styles on the album, Mike D said in 1998: &quot;We spent so much time in the studio that we weren&#x27;t in touch with the things that happened around us, not what&#x27;s going on in the music scene and not what other people think about our music. We didn&#x27;t even hear other opinions; we were rather reclusive. You know, there is nothing planned on the album, we didn&#x27;t plan anything. All you hear are different sounds, sounds we experimented with, nothing else. Maybe that&#x27;s our problem: we were so far removed from everything, it was like being underground, really underground, like in a hole in the ground.&quot;

The title of the album was allegedly inspired by the receptionist of the band&#x27;s NY-based publicity firm Nasty Little Man, who would answer the phone with the greeting &quot;Hello, Nasty.&quot;

There were CD, double-vinyl LP, MiniDisc, and cassette tape releases of the album. One of the cassette formats was packaged for a limited run by BioBox in a small cardboard box, rather than a clear plastic case, in an attempt to distinguish the retail product and augment sales.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Hello Nasty&quot; received mostly positive reviews upon its release. Caroline Sullivan, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, named it the &quot;Pop CD of the Week&quot; and said it &quot;fills a gap created by the current profusion of serious rock bands like Radiohead; elbowing its way up front, [and letting] rip with adolescent vigour.&quot; She went on to summarize the record as &quot;the perfect party soundtrack by the perfect party band.&quot; &quot;Select&quot;″s John Harris praised the Beastie Boys&#x27; lyrics for being as &quot;fantastically off-beam as ever&quot;, while at the same time noting that they had &quot;broadened their musical vistas yet further&quot;. Although AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt the album&#x27;s ending was &quot;a little anticlimactic&quot;, he also saw &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; as a progressive step forward from the group&#x27;s 1992 LP &quot;Check Your Head&quot; and praised the contributions of the group&#x27;s new recruit, Mix Master Mike: &quot;Hiring DJ Mixmaster Mike turned out to be a masterstroke; he and the Beasties created a sound that strongly recalls the spare electronic funk of the early &#x27;80s, but spiked with the samples and post-modern absurdist wit that have become their trademarks.&quot; In his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne highlighted the album&#x27;s multi-genre sound as its most engaging aspect:

&quot;Hello Nasty&quot; is a sonic smorgasbord in which the Beasties gorge themselves with reckless abandon. They dabble in lounge-pop kitsch (the loser put-down &quot;Song for the Man&quot;), make like a summit of Santana and Traffic (the Latin-flavored &quot;Song for Junior&quot;), and subtly incorporate a drum-and-bass shuffle into the mix (&quot;Flowin&#x27; Prose&quot;). The melange makes for a looser, more free-spirited record than their earlier albums; the music invites you in, rather than threatening to shut you out.

<text>Mathis S.A. was an automobile manufacturer in Alsace that produced cars between 1910 and 1950. Founder Émile Mathis (1880–1956) was born in Strasbourg and died in Geneva.

==Hermès-Simplex==

Émile Mathis was a leading car dealer in Strasbourg, Alsace, handling Fiat, De Dietrich and Panhard-Levassor, among other makes from his Auto-Mathis-Palace. Two models were designed for him by the young Ettore Bugatti. Made at his Graffenstaden factory he marketed them under the brand Hermes with 28, 40, or 98 hp engines. They were Mercedes-like cars with chain drives. Designer and racing-driver Dragutin Esser then created two cars of 2025 cc and 2253 cc which were built under license from Stoewer.

==Mathis==
The Mathis &quot;8/20 PS&quot; was first offered in 1910 but the first real success came just before World War I with two smaller models: &quot;Babylette&quot; had a 1.1 L engine and &quot;Baby&quot; had a 1.3 L engine. There was also a Mathis-Knight model.


During World War I, Mathis was sent by the German government (Alsace was then part of Germany) to Switzerland to buy tyres and after one of these trips, he went to France and remained there. After the war, Alsace became part of France and he was able to return to his factory.

After the war, the firm&#x27;s production increased quickly and soon became No.4 in France making more than 20,000 cars in 1927. Mathis attempted to compete with Citroën. The &quot;SB&quot; model of 1921 was followed by a six-cylinder model (1188 cc) in 1923 and an eight-cylinder in 1925. From 1927, Mathis followed a one-model policy. &quot;MY&quot; has a side-valve four-cylinder engine (1.2 L). Not surprisingly, the next year saw the &quot;Emysix&quot;, with a 2288 cc six-cylinder.
===Matam, Durant===
In 1930 there was an unsuccessful attempt to co-operate with William Crapo Durant (the founder of General Motors in 1908). Their ambitious plan was to make 100,000 cars in Durant&#x27;s Lansing, Michigan plant. However, Durant ran out of money before production could begin so Mathis stayed in France. The American company was Matam, Mathis-America.

===Depression===
A short-lived model named &quot;FOH&quot; in 1931 had a 3 Litre straight-eight-cylinder engine. More modern and successful was the 1445 cc &quot;Emyquatre&quot; in 1933, which possessed a synchromesh gearbox, hydraulic brakes and independent front suspension. &quot;Emyhuit&quot; (obviously, an 8-cylinder) came too late to prevent Mathis from a fast decline. The Mathis factories were closed.
===Ford and Matford===
Automobiles Ford S.A. Française&#x27;s operations became uneconomic with the sudden erection of tariff barriers in 1932 against imported components, mainly from Britain. Ford and Mathis entered protracted and uncomfortable negotiations. In 1934 a joint venture of Ford and Mathis emerged (Matford SA Française, Strasbourg). Matford, which copied the style of contemporary British Ford models, soon became one of the biggest competitors - the original Mathis factory closed down in 1935. The last models featured a V-shaped windscreen. Matford ceased production in 1939.

===Second World war===
Émile Mathis regained his Strasbourg factory just before World War II, but by now it was clear that he would not be able to remain so close to a part of the Franco-German frontier which was expected to be a major zone of protracted conflict. Matthis, as an Alsatian, had been conscripted into the German army during the First World War but in 1916 had deserted from the German army (with a large amount of cash) while on a mission to buy trucks in Switzerland, and had then joined the French army. French defeat in June 1940 therefore found Émile Mathis high on the &quot;wanted&quot; list of the victorious Germans, but he was careful to get away in time and spent the rest of war in the United States with his company Matam.

The plant at Poissy that opened in 1940 was not a Matford plant but a Ford of France plant, although the Ford 472A produced in it was little changed from the prewar Matford joint venture product.

===Post-war===
Mathis was left with his Strasbourg plant which was still relatively new but which had been largely destroyed by bombing. Mathis concentrated, initially, on rebuilding the plant, and this project seems to have been more or less completed by 1948.

Having spent the war in United States, Mathis was not well connected with the post-Vichy political class. After the war the company was not one of the automakers included in the Pons Plan. The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and civil servants: exclusion from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials. Nevertheless, Mathis tried to find new projects: these included the &quot;flattened egg-shaped&quot; 700 cc three-wheeler (&quot;Mathis VL333&quot;) first exhibited in 1945. When this failed to find favour with the authorities he switched tack, producing a front-wheel drive prototype with a flat-six (2.8 L) engine, and an eyecatching &quot;panoramic&quot; style windscreen. These post-war projects failed, and the factory was only kept going by making engines for light aircraft and components for Renault. The Mathis company closed in 1950.

==Aero-engines==
Mathis introduced a range of aero-engines intended for the Post-war light aircraft industry but few designs evolved past the prototype stage, with the notable exception of the Mathis G4. Mathis aero-engines that reached production, prototype or advanced design stages are listed here:

* Mathis G4
* Mathis G4R
* Mathis G7
* Mathis G7R
* Mathis G8
* Mathis G8R
* Mathis G14R
* Mathis G14RS
* Mathis Vesta 42
* Mathis Vesta 42B
* Mathis Vesta 42E
* Mathis 175H

The plant was eventually bought by Citroën in 1954. Émile Mathis died in Geneva, 3 August 1956.

<doc id="710809" wikidata="Q594570" url="?curid=710809" title="Samuel Dexter">
<text>Samuel Dexter (May 14, 1761May 4, 1816) was an early American statesman who served both in Congress and in the Presidential Cabinets of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Dexter was a 1781 graduate of Harvard College. After receiving his degree he studied law, attained admission to the bar in 1784, and began to practice in Lunenburg, Massachusetts.

A Federalist, Dexter served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1788 to 1790. In 1792 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and he served in the 3rd United States Congress. The state legislature subsequently elected Dexter to the United States Senate, and he served from March 1799 to May 1800. Dexter resigned his senate seat to accept appointment as the fourth United States Secretary of War, and he served from 1800 to 1801. In January 1801, Dexter was appointed the third United States Secretary of the Treasury, and he served until resigning in the day before his fortieth birthday.

After leaving office, Dexter practiced law in Washington, D.C. until he returned to Boston in 1805. Dexter joined the Democratic-Republican Party because of its support for the War of 1812, and he was a candidate for governor in 1814 and 1815. In 1815, Dexter declined President James Madison&#x27;s appointment as Minister to Spain. He was a candidate for governor again in 1816, but died on May 4, 1816, aged 54, while visiting his son in Athens, New York. Dexter was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Boston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Samuel Dexter, a Massachusetts politician and Hannah (Sigourney) Dexter. He was the grandson of Samuel Dexter, the fourth minister of Dedham. Dexter graduated from Harvard University in 1781 and then studied law in Worcester under Levi Lincoln Sr., the future Attorney General of the United States. After he passed the bar in 1784, he began practicing in Lunenburg, Massachusetts.

== Congressional career ==
He was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives and served from 1788 to 1790. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Federalist, serving in the 3rd Congress. He served in the United States Senate from March 4, 1799, to May 30, 1800 (the 6th Congress). Between his terms in Congress, he unsuccessfully ran in the 9th congressional district in 1796.

During a House discussion on a Naturalization Bill in 1795, Virginia Representative William Branch Giles controversially suggested that all immigrants be forced to take an oath renouncing any titles of nobility they previously held. Dexter responded by questioning why Catholics were not required to denounce allegiance to the Pope, because priestcraft had initiated more problems throughout history than aristocracy. Dexter&#x27;s points caused an infuriated James Madison to defend American Catholics, many of whom, such as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, had been good citizens during the American Revolution, and to point out that hereditary titles were barred under the Constitution in any event.

In December 1799, he wrote the Senate eulogy for George Washington. Dexter served in the Senate for less than a year, and resigned in order to accept his appointment as United States Secretary of War in the administration of President John Adams.

== Tenures as Secretary of War and Secretary of the Treasury ==
During his time at the War Department he urged congressional action to permit appointment and compensation of field officers for general staff duty.

When Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott Jr. resigned in December 1800, Adams appointed Dexter as interim secretary, and Dexter served from January to May 1801. With incoming President Thomas Jefferson wanting to delay his choice for Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, for a recess appointment in May, Dexter agreed to retain his duties as Secretary of the Treasury for the first two months of Jefferson&#x27;s term. In a letter to his wife on March 5, 1801, Gallatin said that Dexter had behaved &quot;with great civility.&quot;

== Later life ==
He returned to Boston in 1805 and resumed the practice of law. He also invested in the Dedham Manufacturing Company.

He left the Federalists and became a Democratic-Republican because he supported the War of 1812. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1814, 1815 and 1816.

Dexter was an ardent supporter of the temperance movement and presided over its first formal organization in Massachusetts. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1800.

== Death and legacy ==
Dexter died at the age of fifty-four in Athens, New York on May 4, 1816, ten days shy of his fifty-fifth birthday. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Simon Newton Dexter and Andrew Dexter Jr. were his nephews.

Samuel W. Dexter, founder of Dexter, Michigan, was his son.

<doc id="710813" wikidata="Q1264106" url="?curid=710813" title="Tim Keefe">
<text>Timothy John Keefe (January 1, 1857 – April 23, 1933), nicknamed &quot;Smiling Tim&quot; and &quot;Sir Timothy&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He stood tall and weighed . He was one of the most dominating pitchers of the 19th century and posted impressive statistics in one category or another for almost every season he pitched. He was the second MLB pitcher to record 300 wins. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964.

Keefe&#x27;s career spanned much of baseball&#x27;s formative stages. His first season was the last in which pitchers threw from 45 feet, so for most of his career he pitched from 50 feet. His final season was the first season in which pitchers hurled from the modern distance of 60 feet, 6 inches.

==Early life==
Keefe was born on January 1, 1857, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father, Patrick, was an Irish immigrant who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was a prisoner of war for several years. All four of Patrick&#x27;s brothers were killed in the war; Tim had been named after two of them. Tim&#x27;s brother became a major and fought in the Spanish–American War.

After the war, Patrick had high expectations for his son, and the two frequently fought over Tim&#x27;s pursuit of baseball. With the help of local former pitcher Tommy Bond, Keefe persisted and became known as a standout local pitcher by 1876. Keefe&#x27;s early professional career included minor league stints in Lewiston, Clinton, New Bedford, Utica, and Albany.

==Major league career==
Keefe entered the major leagues in 1880 with the Troy Trojans. He immediately established himself as a talented pitcher, posting an astounding 0.86 ERA in 105 innings pitched, a record that still stands. (He also posted the best Adjusted ERA+ in baseball history in 1880.) Despite the sterling ERA, he managed but a 6–6 record, pitching in 12 games, all complete games.

In 1883, after the Trojans folded, Keefe rose to stardom with the New York Metropolitans of the American Association under manager &quot;Gentleman&quot; Jim Mutrie and had one of the most dominating seasons in baseball&#x27;s early history. On July 4 of that year, Keefe pitched both ends of a doubleheader against Columbus, winning the first game with a one-hitter; the second a two-hit gem. He went 41–27 over 619 innings pitched with a 2.41 ERA and 361 strikeouts. His 1884 campaign was almost as dominant, winning 37 games, losing 17, and striking out 334.

In 1885, John B. Day, who owned the Metropolitans and the New York Giants of the National League, moved Keefe and Mutrie to the Giants. Here, Keefe joined future Hall of Famers Buck Ewing, Monte Ward, Roger Connor, Mickey Welch, and &quot;Orator&quot; Jim O&#x27;Rourke to form an outstanding team that finished with a fine 85–27 record. Keefe went 32–13 with a 1.58 ERA and 227 strikeouts. In 1887, Keefe sat out several weeks of the season after he struck a batter in the head with a pitch; he was said to have suffered a nervous breakdown.

He had arguably his greatest season in 1888, when he led the league with a 35–12 record, 1.74 ERA and 335 strikeouts (see Triple Crown). He won 19 consecutive games that season, a record that stood for 24 years. The Giants played the St. Louis Browns of the American Association in a postseason series for the Dauvray Cup, and Keefe added four more wins to his tally. Keefe even designed the famous all-black &quot;funeral&quot; uniforms the Giants wore that season.

Keefe was very well paid for his career, yet he was a leading member of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, an early players&#x27; union that fought for the welfare of players. He assisted his brother-in-law Monte Ward to form the Players&#x27; League for the 1890 season. As a co-organizer of the Players&#x27; League, he recognized that he might be financially vulnerable if the league failed to make money. Keefe transferred ownership of his real estate assets to his mother so that they would remain safe from any legal rulings.

Shortly before the Players&#x27; League was founded, Keefe had started a sporting goods business in New York with W. H. Becannon, a former employee of baseball owner and sporting goods entrepreneur Albert Spalding. Keefe and Becannon manufactured the Keefe ball, the official baseball of the league. Spalding and the other NL owners fought against the new league, employing legal and financial maneuvers (such as slashing NL ticket prices) that made competition difficult. The Players&#x27; League folded after one season.

In the 1891 preseason, Keefe refused a salary offer of $3,000 from New York; he had earned $4,500 in the previous season. Keefe said, &quot;I want to play in New York, but I never will for a $3,000 salary... To tell you the truth, however, I do not think I am wanted in the New York team, and this cutting method is being pursued to keep me out.&quot; Keefe ultimately signed with the team for a $3,500 salary.

During the 1891 season, Keefe was released by New York. He was drawing a high salary and was not meeting the expectations of the team&#x27;s leadership. After his release, Keefe said, &quot;I hate to leave New York, am very fond of it, and would do all in my power for New York, but what am I to do? I have been systematically done by the New York Baseball Club... They would not let me play, and when I did get a chance, I worked under a disadvantage. I feel that I am just as good a player as I ever was.&quot;

Keefe moved to the Philadelphia Phillies after his release from the Giants. He retired after the 1893 season with 342 wins (10th all time), a 2.62 ERA, and 2,562 strikeouts. His 2,562 strikeouts were a major league record at the time of his retirement. He was also the first pitcher to achieve three 300-plus strikeout seasons, done during his dominating prime in the 1880s in which he won the most games of the decade with 291. He still holds the record for having wins in the most ballparks, with 47.

Keefe was nicknamed &quot;Sir Timothy&quot; because of his gentlemanly behavior on and off the field. He never drank or smoked.

==Later life and legacy==

Late in his playing career, Keefe began to coach college baseball and he continued in this capacity after his retirement as a player. Beginning in the spring of 1893, Keefe began to work as a pitching coach for Harvard. Keefe also worked as an umpire for a total of 243 major league games; his most active year was 1895, when he umpired 129 games. He was also involved in real estate. He died in his hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 76.

Keefe was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964 after being elected by the Veterans Committee. Six players were inducted that year, and Keefe was one of five who had been voted in by the Veterans Committee.

<doc id="710818" wikidata="Q1393650" url="?curid=710818" title="Sharks (rugby union)">
<text>The Sharks (known as the [[Hollywoodbets]] Sharks as they are their title sponsor) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. They compete internationally in the United Rugby Championship and Champions Cup, having competed in the Super Rugby competition until 2020. They are centred on the union, also based in Durban and drawing players from all of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. The team plays its home matches at the Hollywoodbets Kings Park Stadium in Durban.

In 1993–1995 South Africa was represented in the Super 10 by their three top unions (top three teams from the previous years Currie Cup). Natal (as they were called then) qualified in 1993 and 1994. Natal were runners-up in 1994 after having lost to Queensland 21–10 in the final. In 1996 and 1997 South Africa was represented in the Super 12 by their four top unions rather than franchises, and Natal qualified and competed both years. They have never won the Super Rugby competition, but have reached the final four times, as Natal in 1996 and as the Sharks in 2001, 2007 and 2012.

The side sports many Springbok players, including Aphelele Fassi, Ox Nche, Makazole Mapimpi, Lukhanyo Am, Bongi Mbonambi, most capped Springbok Eben Etzebeth and double Rugby World Cup winning captain Siya Kolisi. They have also featured many international stars including France international Frédéric Michalak and former Australian International Ben Tapuai.

Four times Super Rugby runners-up, in May 2024, Sharks finally won their first major honour, and became the first South African team to ever win a European trophy, by defeating Gloucester Rugby in the final of the 2023–24 EPCR Challenge Cup at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

==History==
Natal competed in the inaugural Super 10 during the 1993 season. They were in Pool A along with Auckland, Western Samoa, Queensland and Otago. They finished second in the pool on 12 points, behind Auckland on 16. The next season they played in Pool B with New South Wales, Western Samoa, Auckland and Waikato, and finished at the top of the pool to face Pool A winners Queensland in the final in Durban. Natal lost the game 21 to 10. Natal did not play in the 1995 series.

The Sharks&#x27; Currie Cup team played in the first Super 12 season, in 1996. After 11 games the Sharks finished fourth in the final standings, enough to get them through to the finals. They defeated Queensland at Ballymore 43 to 25 to get into the first Super 12 championship game. They finished inaugural runners-up, losing to Auckland 45 to 21 in Auckland. The following season Natal finished fourth once again, but lost their semi-final against Auckland.

In 1998 the Coastal Sharks (as the team was now styled) won 7 of their 11 games, and finished in their best position yet, third place. They were however defeated by the Crusaders in the semi-finals. The following season the Sharks missed the finals, finishing 7th. In 2000 the Sharks finished last in the final standings. However the next season they came second – at the time their best ever finish – and after defeating the Cats, went to Canberra for the final, which they lost against the Brumbies.

In 2002 the Sharks missed the finals after finishing 10th on the season table. The following season they came 11th. 2004 was a better season for the team, coming in at 7th after the regular season. However, in 2005 saw them slump to 12th.
In 2006, the Super 12 was expanded and became the Super 14. In the first Super 14 season the Sharks narrowly missed the finals, missing out on a 4th-place finish on points difference. In 2007 they were top of the table and became the first South African side to host a Super 12 or 14 final. The Sharks fought hard in the final but lost to the Bulls after a try by Bryan Habana.

In 2011 the Super Rugby competition was expanded again to feature an additional team from Australia changing the competition to the Super Rugby tournament. The 2012 season saw the Sharks struggle in the first few weeks, but a run of good form saw them lose only one of their last seven games to sneak into the playoffs in 6th position. They had to travel to Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane, Australia for the qualifier against The Reds, whom they beat 30–17 to reach the semi-finals. They then had to travel another 11 000 km back to Cape Town to face the Stormers, they were not given much of a chance after having crossed the Indian for the second time in as many weeks, but again they prevailed 26–19. Having beaten the Crusaders in the other semi-final, the Chiefs claimed home ground advantage for the final. After travelling over the Indian yet again (the third time in three weeks, 55 000 km travelled in total) to Hamilton, the Sharks met the Chiefs for the final, but the fairytale was not to be, and they were defeated 37–6 by the Chiefs, who claimed their first ever Super Rugby title.

The Sharks did manage to win the South African Conference and trophy once in 2014. However, after the then Director of Rugby Jake White left the club to take up a coaching role at Montpellier he left his assistant coach Brad McLeod-Henderson in charge of the Super Rugby side. After a disastrous 2015 season finishing 11th, McLeod-Henderson left the Sharks and was replaced by Gary Gold. Gold only lasting one year at the team, however the Sharks managed a four-year run of quarter final finishes between 2016 and 2019. The Sharks lead the 2020 season on 24 points having played 7 games with the Crusaders and Brumbies both on 23 points having played 6 games. The season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was never completed.

With the Covid pandemic limiting travel, regional Super Rugby tournaments were hosted, with the South African sides taking part in Super Rugby Unlocked. The tournament was heavily affected by the pandemic and several games were cancelled, nonetheless the Sharks managed a third-place finish. It was announced in 2021 that the South African franchises would leave Super Rugby, and that South Africa would be represented by the 4 top franchises in the newly renamed United Rugby Championship. Due to the pandemic still causing problems for international travel another temporary regional tournament was announced, called the Pro14 Rainbow Cup. The South African sides competed in the &#x27;Rainbow Cup SA&#x27;. The Sharks finished second behind the Bulls who went on to lose against the European leg winners, Benetton Treviso. The Sharks played their first official URC game against Munster in Ireland on 25 September 2021.

In 2021 it was announced that an American consortium under the name &#x27;MVM Holdings&#x27; in partnership with Roc Nation, an entertainment agency owned by rapper JayZ, would buy a 51% majority stake in the Sharks franchise. Roc Nation later aided in the purchase of the English side Saracens by a consortium of investors.

==The Sharks brand==

After being informally called the Banana Boys or &quot;&quot; for a substantial length of time it was decided in 1995 that Natal would go ahead with new branding – The Sharks. This brand was conceived, presented and initially executed by Terry Kukle of Tag International Media. The Sharks mascot Sharkie was launched in 1995. To achieve this a substantial budget was allocated to refine this vision that would include the match facilities, the pre-and post-match activities and the team. The local press at first were very hesitant to accept the new name and branding and fans were polarised by the radical proposed change that flew in the face of rugby tradition and convention. After much controversy in the media (which very rapidly brought the proposed brand to everyone&#x27;s attention) and a very successful season supported by great products and promotions, the Sharks were embraced by all. The Sharks&#x27; marketing has been widely acknowledged in marketing and rugby circles as best practice and included as a successful case study in many marketing textbooks.

There was initially significant resistance from many quarters. This resistance was ascribed to the traditional attitudes of the rugby-loving stakeholders. However, the strategy was successful and the success of the marketing has been widely acknowledged. Crowd attendances, merchandising, suite holder and season ticket sales have all been very successful. The brand is now internationally recognised and the branding strategy is reaping dividends for all its stakeholders. As a result, since the mid-1990s the Sharks have become one of the most well-recognised and popular unions in the South African rugby landscape. The Sharks are well supported across South Africa, with sizable fan bases in all major cities including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Most of their supporters however live in KwaZulu-Natal Province, particularly in and around Durban and Pietermaritzburg.

==Stadium==

Hollywoodbets Kings Park Stadium in Durban is the home ground of The Sharks. It is locally known as &quot;The Shark Tank&quot;. It currently has a capacity of 54,000. In addition to being the home of the Sharks, it is also used during the Currie Cup for the . The ground was originally built in 1968, but have been worked on numerous times. A major upgrade occurred for the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

==Region==

When the Super Rugby franchise system was launched in South Africa in 1998, the team was called the Coastal Sharks and covered the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, therefore drawing players from the , and Currie Cup teams. This lasted until 2005, when the Eastern Cape attempted to launch their own Super Rugby franchise, the Southern Spears. That meant that the Border Bulldogs and Mighty Elephants teams were aligned with the Spears (and later Southern Kings) franchise and the Sharks were effectively affiliated with one provincial union only, namely KwaZulu-Natal.

==Current squad==

The Sharks squad for the 2024–25 United Rugby Championship is:

==Coaches==
===History===
The Sharks were coached by Former Springbok coach Ian McIntosh between 1996 and 1999, with Hugh Reece-Edwards as his assistant. In 2000, Reece-Edwards took over as coach with Jake White and Allister Coetzee as assistants.

All three were replaced the following year however, as Rudolf Straeuli was appointed coach, with Kobus van der Merwe as his assistant. In 2002, Clinton Isaacs replaced Van der Merwe as Straeuli&#x27;s assistant.

Kevin Putt was appointed as Straeuli&#x27;s replacement when he was appointed Springbok coach, with Theo Jansen van Rensburg as assistant. Dick Muir replaced Putt in 2006 and pulled in John Plumtree as his assistant. Plumtree took over the head coaching position for the 2007 Currie Cup, whilst Muir took time off to add to his qualifications and learn from some of the most successful coaches in rugby history, such as Sir Clive Woodward. Muir took The Sharks to the 2007 Super 14 final at home and was later seconded as an assistant coach to Peter de Villiers with the national side.

John Plumtree took over as full-time coach in 2008 where he found immediate success, taking the Sharks to their first Currie Cup title since 1996 when they defeated the Blue Bulls in Durban. He repeated that feat in 2010 when his team beat Western Province in the Kings Park final. Following their Super Rugby Final&#x27;s appearance in 2012, the Sharks produced a lacklustre season in 2013, finishing 8th on the combined log and 4th of 5 teams in the South African division. Plumtree&#x27;s final season as Sharks coach was marred by a roster depleted of injuries and perceived tactical challenges.

Soon after the Sharks&#x27; appointment of former Springbok and Sharks captain John Smit as team CEO in mid 2013, news reports emerged that White had contacted former Springbok Brendan Venter to assume a short-term coaching role for the Sharks. Following days of media reports speculating on Plumtree&#x27;s job security, the Sharks announced that Plumtree would not be brought back following the end of the Super Rugby Campaign. Venter was soon appointed as the Director of Rugby for the 2013 Currie Cup campaign, with coaches Brad McLeod-Henderson (forwards) and Sean Everitt (backs) assuming the day-to-day coaching responsibilities. Following the end of the Sharks&#x27; successful 2013 Currie Cup campaign, Venter stepped down as Director of Rugby. Former Springboks&#x27; coach Jake White, looking to return to coaching in South Africa, was soon hired to succeed Venter as the Sharks&#x27; Director of Rugby and Super Rugby coach, with McLeod-Henderson and Everitt remaining as his full-time assistant coaches.

At the end of 2014 White resigned as Super Rugby coach and Director of Rugby, and former Kobelco Steelers coach Gary Gold was hired as Head Coach and Super Rugby coach for the 2015 Super Rugby Season. McLeod-Henderson resigned after a poor Super Rugby Campaign and Gary Gold assumed the reigns as Currie Cup coach for 2015, Director of Rugby and the Super Rugby coach for 2016.

Towards the end of 2016 Gary Gold left the Sharks and assistant coach Robert du Preez became coach for the 2016 Currie Cup campaign, as well as the Super Rugby coach from 2017. Du Preez would lead the Sharks to the quarter-finals of Super Rugby for three consecutive years, but did not manage to progress beyond that stage.

For the 2020 season, du Preez stepped down and Sean Everitt was appointed head coach, with David Williams (backline and attack) and Brent Janse van Rensburg (forwards) as his assistants.

On 28 November 2022 the Sharks played in a 0–35 home defeat to the Welsh side Cardiff. This marked the first time in franchise history the Sharks had failed to score a single point in a home game. Something the provincial Currie Cup side had also never done in the professional era. The last game in which the provincial side had failed to score a point at home was in 1972 against England. 
The following day it was announced that then head coach Sean Everitt would be stepping down with immediate effect, and director of rugby Neil Powell would take over all of the responsibilities.

At the end of the 2022–23 season, it was announced that John Plumtree would be returning to the Sharks for the forthcoming season, once again as head coach, with Powell returning to the role of Director of Rugby.

<text>The Adventures of Pinocchio is a 1996 fantasy comedy family film, directed by Steve Barron and based on the original 1883 novel of the same name by Carlo Collodi. Barron collaborated with Sherry Mills, Tom Benedek and Barry Berman on the screenplay. It was an American, British, French, Czech, and German venture produced by New Line Cinema, The Kushner-Locke Company, Savoy Pictures, Pangaea Holdings and Twin Continental Films. It stars Martin Landau and Jonathan Taylor Thomas. It was a critical and commercial failure which led the sequel, &quot;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, straight to video.

==Plot==
In 18th century in a forest, Italian woodcarver Geppetto carves a heart into a pine tree, expressing his secret love for a woman named Leona. Years later, Geppetto finds the remains of the tree and carves a marionette out of it, naming him Pinocchio. Due to the heart&#x27;s magic, Pinocchio comes to life.

Pinocchio meets a pair of thieves, Volpe and Felinet, who work for Lorenzini, a sinister theater director and puppet master. Lorenzini tries to purchase Pinocchio, but Geppetto refuses to sell his son.

Pinocchio gets into a fight with the rowdy Lampwick and when he lies about it, his nose grows longer and he is kicked out of the class. Pinocchio ends up causing damage to a local bakery, and Geppetto is arrested as a result. Pinocchio flees home, meeting a talking cricket, Pepe, who tells Pinocchio to behave and stay out of trouble to become a real boy. The next day, Pinocchio and Geppetto are put on trial at court. Lorenzini enters, offering to pay off the debt if Pinocchio is given over to him. Geppetto reluctantly agrees.

Pinocchio becomes the star of Lorenzini&#x27;s productions, and is given gold coins as payment. Pinocchio rescues several of Geppetto&#x27;s puppets from being burnt by Lorenzini, unintentionally setting the theater on fire.

Pinocchio spots a stage coach passing by, carrying Lampwick and other boys, travelling to Terra Magica, a hidden fun-fair for boys to do as they please. Drinking the water of Terra Magica turns them into donkeys. The fun-fair turns out to belong to Lorenzini, who sells the donkeys off to circuses and farms. Pinocchio has Lampwick kick Lorenzini into the cursed water, transforming him into a sea monster and forcing him to flee into the ocean. The boys and donkeys escape the fun-fair, and Pinocchio reunites with Leona at the beach before setting out to find his father at sea.

After trying and failing to find Geppetto out at sea, Pinocchio and Pepe are consumed by the sea monster. Both are reunited with Geppetto inside his stomach, which both Pepe and Gepetto describe as smelling like &quot;rotten chili peppers&quot;. As they attempt to escape the sea monster, they find that his throat is too small to enter through. Pinocchio lies to extend his nose and make the passage in the monster&#x27;s throat larger, causing his nose to break. The monster starts to choke, spitting Geppetto and Pinocchio out, before suffocating and sinking to the depths. On land, Pinocchio apologizes to Geppetto for not being a real boy, but Geppetto tells him that he is real to him and they embrace. As Pinocchio begins to cry, the tears land on the heart carving and the same magic that brought him to life transforms him into a real boy. Pinocchio tricks Volpe and Felinet, into drinking the cursed water and turns them into a real fox and real cat. Back at home, Geppetto and Leona marry while Pinocchio goes off to play with Lampwick, who among many others has turned back into a boy after performing many good deeds.

==Reception==
Critically, &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; received a 35% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews with the consensus: &quot;&quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; is an admirably faithful adaptation of the source material, but it may be too frightening for younger viewers – and too dull for older ones.&quot;

On the television review series &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Roger Ebert expressed disappointment with the film, while Gene Siskel praised the special effects, and remarked that he believed the film to be a faithful adaptation of the book, as opposed to Disney&#x27;s interpretation, which strayed significantly from it. Ebert gave the film a two out of four stars and said, &quot;The story is told with visual grace, but lacks excitement. Even Pinocchio&#x27;s little cricket friend seems more like a philosopher than a ringmaster. Smaller children may be caught up by the wonder of it all, but older children may find the movie slow and old-fashioned.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mostly positive review, writing &quot;&quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; is a well-crafted and gently charming version of the classic 1883 novel by Carlo Collodi. Unfortunately, this live-action, non-musical adaptation must compete with vivid (and, in many cases, video-enhanced) memories of Disney&#x27;s beloved 1940 animated feature.&quot;

In her seminar &quot;The Persistent Puppet: Pinocchio&#x27;s Heirs in Contemporary Fiction and Film&quot;, Rebecca West found &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; to be relatively faithful to the original novel, although she noted major differences, such as the replacement of the Blue Fairy by the character of Leona. Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave the film a negative review, writing &quot;Despite the interesting differences between the latest &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, which mixes animated and live characters, and the wholly animated Disney version, the new film simply doesn&#x27;t generate much magical enchantment.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
==Sequel==
A sequel was released in 1999 called &quot;The New Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;. Landau reprised his role as Geppetto, while Kier was recast as Lorenzini&#x27;s estranged wife, Madame Flambeau. Gabriel Thomson played the title role, replacing Jonathan Taylor Thomas. It was shot in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg.

<text>Hemshof is one of the oldest city districts of Ludwigshafen Am Rhein, Germany. It is located above the &quot;Nord&quot; district. The first settlement in Hemshof is believed to have been built by the Celts in 516, not as a city but as a small farm.
In the 19th century the Hemshof became an important living district for the workers in the BASF.

<text>Calydon (; , ) was a Greek city in ancient Aetolia, situated on the west bank of the river Evenus, 7.5 Roman miles (approx. 11 km) from the sea.
Its name is most famous today for the Calydonian boar that had to be overcome by heroes of the Olympian age.

==Mythology==
According to Greek mythology, Calydon was founded by Aetolus in the land of the Curetes, and was called Calydon, after the name of his son, Calydon. Calydon and the neighbouring town of Pleuron are said by Strabo to have been once the &quot;ornament&quot; of Greece, but by his time (late 1st century BC) had sunk into insignificance. It is frequently mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; by Homer, who celebrates the fertility of the plain of &quot;lovely&quot; Calydon. In the earliest times the inhabitants of Calydon appear to have been engaged in incessant hostilities with the Curetes, who continued to reside in their ancient capital Pleuron, and who endeavoured to expel the invaders from their country. A vivid account of one of the battles between the Curetes and Calydonians is given in an episode of the &quot;Iliad.&quot;

The heroes of Calydon are among the most celebrated of the heroic age. It was the residence of Oeneus, father of Tydeus and Meleager, and grandfather of Diomedes. In the time of Oeneus Artemis sent a monstrous boar (the Calydonian Boar) to lay waste the fields of Calydon, which was hunted by Meleager and numerous other heroes. The Calydonians took part in the Trojan War under their king Thoas, the son (not the grandson) of Oeneus.

==History==
Calydon is not often mentioned in the historical period. In 391 BC, it was recorded as being in the possession of the Achaeans, but the means of possession are unclear; however, it is better documented that Naupactus was given to the Achaeans at the close of the Peloponnesian War, and it was probably the Achaeans settled at Naupactus who gained possession of the town. In the above-mentioned year the Achaeans at Calydon, were so hard pressed by the Acarnanians that they applied to the Lacedaemonians for help; and Agesilaus II in consequence was sent with an army into Aetolia. Calydon remained in the hands of the Achaeans till the overthrow of the Spartan supremacy by the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), when Epaminondas restored the town to the Aetolians. In the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey (in 48 BC) it still appears as a considerable place; but a few years afterwards its inhabitants were removed by Augustus to Nicopolis, which he founded to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. It continues however to be mentioned by the later geographers.

Calydon was the headquarters of the worship of Artemis Laphria, and when the inhabitants of the town were removed to Nicopolis, Augustus gave to Patrae in Achaea the statue of this goddess which had belonged to Calydon. There was also a statue of Dionysus at Patrae which had been removed from Calydon. Near Calydon there was a temple of Apollo Laphrius; and in the neighbourhood of the city there was also a lake celebrated for its fish.

Its site is located north of the modern Evinochori. One of the tunnels of the A5 motorway crosses under the ruins of Calydon, and is named the Calydon Tunnel () after it.

==Archaeology==
Previous and more recent excavations have revealed many buildings including:

* the Hellenistic theatre of an unusual square plan
* the Hellenistic Heroon (palaestra) with a rich tomb underneath the Heroon
* the Artemis Laphria sanctuary with the temple of Artemis, smaller temple of Apollo, and remains of other buildings spanning the Geometric to the Hellenistic period
* the Lower Acropolis where excavations were carried out recently uncovering a house from the 2nd cent BC
* the Lower Town where a peristyle house and kilns were found

==Finds==
Many finds from the site including ancient terracottas from the temple of Artemis are exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Agrinion and in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens.

<doc id="710830" wikidata="Q661668" url="?curid=710830" title="William Eustis">
<text>William Eustis (June 10, 1753 – February 6, 1825) was an early American physician, politician, and statesman from Massachusetts. Trained in medicine, he served as a military surgeon during the American Revolutionary War, notably at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He resumed medical practice after the war, but soon entered politics.

After several terms in the state legislature, Eustis won election to the United States Congress in 1800, serving as a moderate Democratic-Republican. He briefly returned to state politics after losing reelection in 1804, and was chosen to be Secretary of War in 1809 by President James Madison. Due in part to his inexperience at managing the army and a lack of preparedness, the military failures in the early months of the War of 1812 were laid on his shoulders, leading to his resignation.

Madison then appointed Eustis Minister to the Netherlands, a post he held from 1814 until 1818. After another period in Congress, he was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1822. A popular successor to long-serving John Brooks, Eustis died in office in 1825. His Boston mansion, built in the 1750s by royal governor William Shirley, is known as the Shirley-Eustis House and is a National Historic Landmark.

==Early years and military service==
William Eustis was born on June 10, 1753, in Cambridge, to Benjamin Eustis, a prominent Boston doctor, and Elizabeth (Hill) Eustis. He was the second surviving son of twelve children. He was educated at the Boston Latin School before he entered Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1772. While at Harvard he belonged to an undergraduate militia unit called the Martimercurian Band.

After graduation he studied medicine under Dr. Joseph Warren, a well-known Patriot political leader. When the Battles of Lexington and Concord sparked the American Revolutionary War in April 1775, Warren and Eustis both worked in the field, tending the injured revolutionaries. Warren secured for Eustis a commission as regimental surgeon to the rebel artillery. Eustis helped care for the wounded at the June 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill, in which Warren was killed. He served with the Continental Army in the New York and New Jersey campaign, refusing a lieutenant colonel&#x27;s commission offered by artillery chief Henry Knox. During his Continental Army service, Eustis met and established an enduring friendship with New Jersey native Aaron Burr.

In 1777 Eustis was placed in command of a military hospital established at the former residence of Loyalist Beverley Robinson north of New York City, where he remained for the duration of the war. In September 1780 he played a minor role in events surrounding the flight of traitor Benedict Arnold: he treated Arnold&#x27;s wife Peggy, who was seemingly hysterical over the sudden departure of her husband and the discovery of his plot.

After the war Eustis returned to medical practice in Boston. He was once again called on to serve in military matters when Shays&#x27; Rebellion broke out in western Massachusetts in 1786, becoming surgeon to the militia force raised by General Benjamin Lincoln that quashed the rebellion in the early months of 1787. Eustis was admitted as an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Massachusetts when it was established in 1783. He later served as Vice President of the Massachusetts Society from 1786 to 1810, and again from 1820 to 1821.

==Legislator==
Eustis was elected to the Massachusetts General Court (the state legislature) from 1788 to 1794, which he left because he was &quot;sick of&quot; the political gamesmanship in the body. He was thereafter chosen to serve on the Governor&#x27;s Council for two years. In 1800 he ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. During his successful campaign against Josiah Quincy, Eustis was charged with either authoring, or being complicit in the production of, letters that formed a part of the 1783 Newburgh Conspiracy, a threatened uprising in the Continental Army. Eustis publicly denied being the author of the letters, but was silent on his role in the affair. (John Armstrong later admitted to writing the letters, and Eustis acknowledged some years later that he was privy to the plot.)

Eustis was a moderate Democratic-Republican who did not seek the significant reforms more radical Republicans wanted. He demonstrated this by voting against President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801, a Federalist bill passed in the late days of the John Adams administration that had greatly expanded the number of seats on the federal bench. He was also one of six Democratic-Republicans in the House to oppose the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1802 Eustis was reelected, defeating John Quincy Adams, and in a rematch of the 1800 election with Quincy, Eustis was defeated by fewer than 100 votes. While in the House, he was one of the impeachment managers appointed by the House of Representatives in 1804 to conduct the impeachment proceedings (the first such action to succeed) against John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for New Hampshire. In 1804 he argued in favor of arming merchant vessels headed for the West Indies.

==Secretary of War==

When James Madison became president in 1809, he sought to enhance the status of the Democratic-Republicans in Federalist-dominated New England. To that end he chose Eustis to be his Secretary of War. Eustis was not a good choice for the post, lacking the necessary administrative skills and detailed military background. He also had difficult relations with James Wilkinson and Wade Hampton, two senior army commanders.
Eustis made a major push to update the military&#x27;s field manuals, which had not changed since the Revolutionary War. After acquiring copies of manuals published in 1791 for use by the armies of the French Republic, Eustis commissioned a translation and lobbied for adoption of new manuals based on French tactics. Although a new manual was ready for use in 1812, it was not well received by the officer corps, and was not used in the war that broke out that year.

As tensions grew between the United States and Great Britain, Eustis made modest moves to improve military readiness, but did not otherwise distinguish himself or introduce other initiatives or proposals. When the War of 1812 began, the army&#x27;s logistics were in shambles, and it had no overall commander, forcing Eustis to make detailed decisions for nine military districts. When the war began poorly with the surrender of General William Hull at Detroit, Eustis was severely criticized. Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin wrote that there was &quot;a total want of confidence&quot; in Eustis that was felt &quot;through every ramification of the public service.&quot; Eustis tendered his resignation in December 1812, and Secretary of State James Monroe took over his duties until John Armstrong assumed the office on February 13, 1813.

==Netherlands minister==
Eustis was next appointed minister of the United States to the Netherlands by President Madison, serving from 1814 to 1818. Madison believed the post to be important for sounding out conditions in Europe due to The Hague&#x27;s historical use as a neutral ground for negotiations, and he instructed Eustis to track European diplomatic sentiment. However, the status of the Dutch declined after the defeat of Napoleon, and the post was not particularly active. Eustis unsuccessfully pursued claims against the Dutch for seizures of American goods and ships that had taken place during the reign of Louis Bonaparte over the Kingdom of Holland (the claims were eventually acknowledged by France). Eustis was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. Eustis and Albert Gallatin, then the US Ambassador to France, negotiated a new commerce treaty with the Dutch government in 1817; it was ratified in 1818. Eustis was at a disadvantage due to his lack of French language skill, and was recalled in 1818 after the Dutch government reduced its American delegation head to a chargé d&#x27;affaires. While in Europe Eustis renewed an acquaintance with the Marquis de Lafayette, with whom he had served in the Revolutionary War.

==Later offices==

Upon his return from Europe, Eustis purchased the mansion in Roxbury built by royal governor William Shirley in the 1750s (which is now known as the Shirley-Eustis House). Eustis was again elected to Congress in a special election called after the resignation of Representative Edward Dowse. He served from 1820 to 1823, presiding as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Military Affairs. In the debate on the admission of Missouri as a state (leading to the Missouri Compromise), Eustis made an impassioned speech in opposition to proposed language in the Missouri Constitution forbidding the entry of free blacks into the state.

He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts three times (1820–22), losing each time to the popular moderate Federalist John Brooks. In 1823 Eustis won the seat in a highly contentious contest with the unpopular arch-Federalist Harrison Gray Otis. Republicans presented Eustis as a moderate successor to Brooks who would be less partisan than Otis, and also highlighted his Revolutionary War experience. He carried Federalist strongholds in Hampshire and Essex Counties, and very nearly defeated in Otis in Boston. Eustis&#x27; victory in the election (combined with a Republican sweep of the legislature the following year) marked the effective end of the Federalist Party in Massachusetts.

Eustis was a popular governor, continuing Brooks&#x27; moderate policies. He nominated his lieutenant governor, Levi Lincoln Jr., to the state&#x27;s high court, and won reelection in 1824 with former Representative Marcus Morton as his lieutenant. While governor he received his old friend Lafayette when he toured the United States. In March–April 1824, perhaps due to his popularity, William Eustis was honored with a single vote at the Democratic-Republican Party Caucus to be the party&#x27;s candidate for U.S. Vice President at the election later that year.

Eustis died in Boston of pneumonia while governor on February 6, 1825. His funeral and temporary interment took place Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground, and he was memorialized by his friend Edward Everett. He was later reinterred at Lexington&#x27;s Old Cemetery.

==Personal life==

During the Revolutionary War Eustis became close friends with Aaron Burr, a friendship that deepened in the 1790s. Burr and Eustis exchanged letters on the most intimate subjects, recommending potential romantic partners to each other and sharing a taste for well-educated women. Eustis aided Burr on one occasion by helping him find accommodations for a young woman whose mother had been involved in an adulterous relationship with Alexander Hamilton; she was placed in a Boston-area boarding school. Eustis may have also been the subject of a teenage crush by Burr&#x27;s daughter Theodosia, who shared intimate details of her life with him (including medical conditions emanating from a difficult pregnancy) well into adulthood.

Eustis was for many years a confirmed bachelor, described as urbane and charming. He married Caroline Langdon in 1801; they had no children. She was the sister of Henry Sherburne Langdon, who had married Eustis&#x27; sister Ann, and the daughter of Woodbury Langdon, a prominent Portsmouth, New Hampshire, merchant and judge. His wife survived him by forty years, after which his Boston property was divided among relatives. The mansion fell into decay, but was acquired by preservationists in 1913 and restored to its 19th-century grandeur in the late 20th century. It is now a house museum and a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Masterton () is a large town in the Greater Wellington Region of New Zealand that operates as the seat of the Masterton District (a territorial authority or local-government district). It is the largest town in the Wairarapa, a region separated from Wellington by the Remutaka ranges. It stands on the Waipoua stream between the Ruamāhunga and Waingawa Rivers – 100 kilometres north-east of Wellington and 40 kilometres south of Eketāhuna.

Masterton has an urban population of , and a district population of 

Masterton businesses includes services for surrounding farmers. Three new industrial parks are being developed in Waingawa, Solway and Upper Plain. The town functions as the headquarters of the annual Golden Shears sheep-shearing competition.

==Suburbs==
Masterton suburbs include:
* Lansdowne, Te Ore Ore on the northern side
* Eastside and Homebush on the eastern side
* Upper Plain, Fernridge, Ngaumutawa, Ākura and Masterton West on the western side
* Kuripuni and Solway on the southern side

==History and culture==

===Early history===

Masterton was founded in 1854 by the Small Farms Association. The association was led by Joseph Masters – after whom the town was named – and aimed to settle working people in villages and on the land. At first Masterton grew slowly, but as its farming hinterland became more productive it began to prosper.

In the 1870s, it overtook Greytown as Wairarapa&#x27;s major town. It became a borough in 1877 and was reached by the railway line from Wellington in 1880. The railway became for a time the main line from Wellington to the north of New Zealand, and its arrival cemented the town&#x27;s position as the Wairarapa region&#x27;s main market and distribution centre.

Waipoua timber mill was producing butter boxes as early as 1884.

In April 1965, one of the country&#x27;s worst industrial accidents occurred at the General Plastics Factory on 170 Dixon Street.

During World War II two battalions of the United States Marine Corps were stationed in Masterton.

===Modern history===

In essence, providing support services for rural industry – living off the sheep&#x27;s back – Masterton&#x27;s real growth ended with that sector&#x27;s retrenchment after the 1974 British entry to the trade and political grouping now the European Union. Efforts to decentralise industry to New Zealand&#x27;s provinces gave Masterton a print works and some other industries, but the lost economic activity was not restored.

From the 1970s, people and businesses left for opportunities elsewhere. In the 1980s, with government deregulation and protective tariffs lifted, more businesses closed, and the town declined further.

It did not quite qualify to be a city by 1989 when the minimum population requirement for that status was lifted from 20,000 to 50,000.

===Marae===

Te Oreore marae and Ngā Tau e Waru meeting house, located in Masterton, is affiliated with the iwi of Ngāti Kahungunu and its hapū of Kahukuraawhitia, Kahukuranui, Ngāti Te Hina, Tahu o Kahungunu, Tamahau and Whiunga, and with the iwi of Rangitāne, and its hapū of Hinetearorangi, Ngāi Tamahau, Ngāti Hāmua, Ngāti Taimahu, Ngāti Tangatakau, Ngāti Te Noti, Ngāti Te Raetea and Ngāti Te Whātui.

In October 2020, the Government committed $2,179,654 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Ngāi Tumapuhia a Rangi ki Okautete, Motuwairaka, Pāpāwai, Kohunui, Hurunui o Rangi and Te Oreore marae. The projects were expected to create 19.8 full time jobs.

Another local marae, Ākura Marae, is affiliated with the Ngāti Kahungunu hapū of Ngāti Te Ahuahu and Ngāti Te Hina. and with the Rangitāne hapū of Ngāti Mātangiuru and Ngāti Te Hina.

==Climate==
Masterton enjoys a mild temperate climate (Köppen: Cfb), grading towards a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csb). Due to the geography of the Wairarapa valley and the Tararua Range directly to the west, the town&#x27;s temperature fluctuates more than the nearby inland city of Palmerston North. Masterton experiences warmer, dry summers with highs above 30 °C possible and colder winters with frequent frost and lows below 0 °C.

==Government==

Between 1877 and 1989, Masterton Borough Council administered the area. An early mayor was the storekeeper Myer Caselberg (1886–1888).

The Masterton District Council (MDC) is the Masterton District territorial authority. It is made up of an elected mayor, a deputy mayor/councillor, and seven additional councillors. They are elected under the First Past the Post system in triennial elections, with the last election being held on Saturday 15 October 2022.

The current council members are: Gary Caffell (M), general ward; Bex Johnson (DM), Tom Hullena, Tim Nelson, Craig Bowyer, at large; David Holmes, Stella Lennox, Brent Goodwin, Māori ward; Marama Tuuta.

Nationally, Masterton is part of the general electorate and the Māori electorate.

===Politics 2013 to 2016===
Applications for local government reorganisation from the Greater Wellington Regional Council and the Wairarapa district councils in mid-2013 led to a proposal from the Local Government Commission for a region-wide unitary authority. In June 2015, the Commission decided not to proceed with this proposal due to lack of public support. Instead, because about 40 per cent of submissions suggested alternatives to the status quo, the Commission decided to work with councils and the community to achieve some consensus on the challenges it faced, and to collaborate in identifying possible options to address the challenges.

==Education==
Masterton&#x27;s schools were reviewed in 2003 to take into account a changing demographic of the population, with several primary schools closing and merging. Today, there are five state primary schools in the township – four state contributing primaries: Douglas Park, Fernridge, Masterton Primary and Solway; and one state full primary: Lakeview. In addition, there are five state full primary schools in the surrounding district: Mauriceville, Opaki, Tinui, Wainuiouru and Whareama, and two state-integrated primaries: St Patrick&#x27;s, a Catholic contributing primary, and Hadlow, an Anglican full primary.

Masterton Intermediate School, with over 500 students, is the only intermediate school in Masterton (and the Wairarapa), bridging the gap between the state contributing primary schools and the secondary schools.

Two state secondary schools serve Masterton: Wairarapa College is the largest of the two with 1050 students, serving the western side of the town, while Makoura College with 320 students serves the eastern side of town. Four state-integrated schools also serve the town: Chanel College is a coeducational Catholic school with its own intermediate department; Rathkeale College and St Matthew&#x27;s Collegiate are Anglican boys and girls schools respectively, with St Matthew&#x27;s having an intermediate department; and Solway College is a Presbyterian girls school with intermediate. There is also a composite (primary/secondary combined) Māori immersion school in the town: Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Wairarapa.

Masterton has its own polytechnic, run by UCOL (Universal College of Learning).

The Masterton District Library and Archive, situated on Queen Street, are part of the Lower North Island SMART Libraries group, which involves sharing books and information between 22 libraries.

==Media==
===Newspapers===
There are several newspapers circulated in Masterton, including two daily publications (&quot;Wairarapa Times-Age&quot;, &quot;The Post&quot;) and a free community title, &quot;Wairarapa Midweek&quot;.
The &quot;Wairarapa Times-Age&quot; is the only daily newspaper based in Masterton. Formed by a merger between the &quot;Wairarapa Age&quot; and the &quot;Wairarapa Daily Times&quot; on 1 April 1938, The &quot;Wairarapa Times-Age&quot; has an audited paid circulation of 5,427. The Wairarapa Times-Age is owned by Stuff Group which bought the &quot;Wairarapa Times-Age&quot; from National Media Limited in May 2024. 

The &quot;Wairarapa Midweek&quot;, a weekly community paper with an audited circulation of 21,186, is distributed every Wednesday along with the TA Property. The &quot;Wairarapa Times-Age&quot; building at 70 Chapel Street no longer holds the presses, and the space was used by the nascent Masterton Fab lab which has now relocated to UCOL.

Fairfax NZ owned The Post is widely circulated in the Masterton district. The Wellington-based metropolitan daily newspaper has an office, Media House, at 123 Chapel Street in Masterton. The Dominion-Post has an audited paid circulation of 55,496.

===Radio===
Masterton is serviced by one local radio station. Wairarapa&#x27;s MORE FM 89.5 or 105.9 for the coastal frequency. MORE FM broadcasts locally from 6am to 10am daily from studios in Kuripuni. The station was founded by controversial Broadcaster Paul Henry, as TODAY FM 89.3 in Carterton, in 1991. Later the station was rebranded as Hitz 89FM, Wairarapa&#x27;s Best Music.

===Television===
Television coverage reached Masterton in 1963, after the Otahoua transmitter east of the town was commissioned to relay Wellington&#x27;s WNTV1 channel (now part of TVNZ 1). The town was early receiving television, since the Otahoua transmitter was required to repeat the signal from the Mount Victoria (and later Mount Kaukau) transmitter in Wellington to the Wharite Peak transmitter near Palmerston North (also commissioned in 1963). Digital terrestrial television (Freeview HD) was introduced to the Masterton area in July 2011, in preparedness for the area&#x27;s digital switchover in September 2013. The service broadcasts from the Popoiti transmitter, south of the township.

==Utilities==
===Water and drainage===

==== Water supply ====
Masterton&#x27;s water is piped from the Waingawa through a Masterton District Council treatment plant on the river, about 10 kilometres west of the town. The water is clarified and filtered, then chlorinated and fluoridated. Lime is added to neutralise the pH to protect the pipes. There is a fluoride-free drinking water tap in Manuka Reserve in Manuka Street.

Typhoid epidemics broke out each year in Masterton and in 1896 Parliament approved a Borough Council loan to build a drainage and water supply system. Work on the water supply did not begin until 1899 delayed by disagreements over the appropriate sources for water. It was finished at the end of 1900 when at the formal opening ceremony there was enough pressure to send a jet right over the Post Office tower to the accompaniment of the Masterton Municipal Brass Band. The mayor, Mr Pownall, said he was now ready to pour cold water on the scheme&#x27;s opponents. A covered reservoir and treatment plant at Fernridge was supplied by an intake from springs beside the Waingawa four miles further up river. The main was duplicated in 1915. It was replaced by the current system, completed in 1983.

==== Wastewater ====
A sewage system was completed in 1901. It drained through settlement ponds and filter beds to the Ruamahanga River south of the town. The sewage farm&#x27;s system included a newfangled &quot;septic tank&quot; which was subject to failures.

In 2012, after a period of heavy rain, eels were found in a Masterton street. In 2013, when the existing treatment pond at the Homebush wastewater treatment plant was being replaced with a new pond, the council had to relocate an estimated 85,000 eels that were living in the old pond. Around half of the eels (about 20 tonnes), were rescued by the iwi Ngati Kahungunu for relocation into other Wairarapa lakes and streams.

In March 2022, following periods of heavy rain, high levels of groundwater infiltration into the sewage network led to the emergency discharge of treated sewage into the Ruamahanga River from the Homebush wastewater treatment plant for a period of one week. In April 2023, the council was strongly criticised for continuing incidents of overflow of raw sewage into properties in Cockburn Street during periods of heavy rain, a recurring problem that dates from 2006.

===Energy===
The Wairarapa Electric Power Board was established in Carterton in 1920 to supply the Wairarapa with electricity from the Kourarau hydropower station at Gladstone, southeast of both towns. Masterton was connected to Mangahao on 17 May 1925 when the transmission line from Bunnythorpe to Masterton (via Woodville and Mangamaire) and the Masterton substation were commissioned. The Wairarapa Electric Power Board moved to headquarters in Masterton in the 1950s. The power board, then named Wairarapa Electricity, dissolved following the 1998 electricity sector reforms. The retail business was sold to Genesis Energy and the distribution lines business sold to Powerco. Today Powerco continues to operate the local distribution network in the town and surrounding district with electricity fed from Transpower&#x27;s national grid at its Masterton substation in Waingawa.

Masterton Gas Company was established by the Borough Council in 1886 by the corner of Bannister and Kirton Streets. About 20 years later it was moved to the end of Bentley Street, just south of the railway station. The large quantities of coal were brought in by rail. By 1945 it had become clear consumers preferred electricity and the gasworks closed in the 1950s.

There is no natural gas network in Masterton, making it the largest North Island urban area without one. There has been no more than a proposal to connect Masterton to the North Island natural gas network via a branch off the Palmerston North to Hastings high-pressure pipeline, commissioned in 1983.

===Telephone===
The Masterton magneto telephone exchange opened on 31 January 1897, with 53 subscribers. On 31 May 1919, Masterton became the first town in New Zealand to have a fully automatic (Western Electric 7A Rotary) telephone exchange.

Masterton and nearby Carterton were the first towns in New Zealand to introduce the emergency number 111, in September 1958.

Before the 1991 to 1993 changes, the area code for Masterton was 059. Today the area code is 06, and numbers generally begin with 370, 372 (rural areas), 377, 378 and 946. Numbers beginning 946 are businesses.

===Internet===
On 3 December 2015 the UFB rollout to the town was completed.

==Transport==

Masterton is very well served by public transport, with rail and bus links. Despite Masterton and the Wairarapa valley being reasonably close to Wellington, they are separated by the Rimutaka Ranges with State Highway 2 cutting a winding hill road through the range, and the Rimutaka railway tunnel. The Wairarapa Line railway allows access to Wellington, Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt.

Unlike other parts of the country, the Wairarapa has seen passenger rail services remain, largely due to its proximity to Wellington and the Rimutaka Tunnel&#x27;s advantage over the Rimutaka Hill road. There has been talk of constructing a road tunnel through the ranges for decades, but this has been ruled out due to the extremely high cost. According to the latest transportation plan from the Greater Wellington Regional Council, the only work planned is for upgrades to the Rimutaka Hill road and the addition of passing lanes between Featherston and Masterton.

Masterton is linked to Wellington and the Hutt Valley by the Wairarapa Connection, a Tranz Metro passenger service run for Greater Wellington Region&#x27;s Metlink, primarily operating at peak times serving commuters from Masterton and the Wairarapa with five return services on Monday to Thursday, six on Friday and two at weekends and public holidays. There are three railway stations in the town; Masterton, Renall Street and Solway. Four stations north of Masterton used to operate at Opaki, Kopuranga, Mauriceville and Mangamahoe. Services to these stations ceased between 1969 and 1988. To cope with an increase in logging in the Wairarapa, an additional 2.5 hectare rail freight hub has been operational in Norfolk Road, Waingawa since March 2016.

===Bus===
There is a local Metlink bus service in Masterton operated by Tranzit. The buses operate on five routes: three suburban and two regional, including:
There is also the MPN: Masterton to Palmerston North (via Woodville) service, not operated under the Metlink brand.

===Air===
Hood Aerodrome is 2 miles southwest of the town of Masterton. As of 2015, there are no commercial flights from Hood Aerodrome. From early 2009 until late 2013, Air New Zealand provided flights to Auckland, operated by subsidiary Eagle Airways six days a week, mainly to serve business customers in the Wairarapa. There have been a few other unsuccessful attempts at commercial air travel in Masterton, mostly failing due to its proximity to major airports in Wellington and Palmerston North. The most significant was by South Pacific Airlines of New Zealand (SPANZ), which operated daily flights using DC3s during the sixties to destinations nationwide until the airline&#x27;s closure in 1966.
== Queen Elizabeth Park ==

Queen Elizabeth Park covers more than near the heart of Masterton on land set aside for the purpose in 1854. Its most notable aspects are the Giant Sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) trees planted in 1875, its other mature trees, and sheltered oval cricket ground. Queen Elizabeth came to Masterton Park in 1954 to be noisily welcomed by the mayor and the citizens and every schoolchild of the Wairarapa. After that, she rested at the Empire hotel, waved to the crowd from the balcony and graciously gave her own name for the park.

=== Miniature railway ===

The park contains a miniature railway, built by the Jaycees and opened in 1972 by Norman Kirk. It has a single station, Waipoua, and is upkept by a group of volunteers. A ride on the train costs $1, a fare that has been unchanged since 1984. The line has a steam locomotive, restored in 2021, which formerly operated at Gisborne and at Caroline Bay, Timaru, where a steam locomotive was operating in 1942. The locomotive&#x27;s origin is unknown, though it is similar to many Atlantic steam engines built by Bassett-Lowke from 1911.

== Museum ==
Aratoi Wairarapa Museum of Art and History opened in Masterton in 1969. A sculpture by Barbara Hepworth was the first item in the museum&#x27;s collection. It now contains almost 4,000 items.

==Sports==
In rugby union, Heartland Championship team Wairarapa Bush is based in Masterton, playing their home games at Memorial Park.

In association football, Central Premier League side Wairarapa United play some of their home games at Masterton; also playing in Carterton.

In cricket, the Hawke Cup team Wairarapa have their headquarters in Masterton. Their home ground is Queen Elizabeth Park.

Masterton has an all-weather athletics track at the Colin Pugh Sports Bowl in Lansdowne.

A motorcycle speedway track known as Penlee Speedway existed on the Norfolk Road during the 1970s and 1980s. It opened in November 1971 and was a significant venue for important speedway events, including the final of the New Zealand Solo Championship in 1978 and 1984.

<doc id="710837" wikidata="Q1405771" url="?curid=710837" title="Manston Airport">
<text>Manston Airport was a British airport. Originally operated as RAF Manston, from 1916, it has also operated as a commercial airport and was known as Kent International Airport and, briefly, London Manston Airport. It has been closed since 2014. Located in the parish of Minster-in-Thanet and partly adjacent to the village of Manston in the Thanet district of Kent, England, north-east of Canterbury. 

The single runway is located about from the coastline at above sea level.

It has the 11th-longest civilian runway in the United Kingdom (after Heathrow&#x27;s two runways, Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester, Stansted, East Midlands, Doncaster, Prestwick and Belfast International), in length. When operational, Manston was capable of handling some of the larger long-haul aircraft, but the runway was not long enough for the largest passenger or freight types at their maximum take-off weights. The runway was originally built with three &quot;lanes&quot; during the Second World War to handle emergencies, and is among the widest in Europe.

Since its closure, the airport has been used as an emergency lorry park in the event of temporary cross-Channel traffic problems, a filming location, including for the 2023 Sam Mendes film Empire of Light and has hosted a variety of aviation events, including the 2023 British Open Paramotor Championships and a general aviation fly-in event (May 2023).

Since 9 July 2019, Manston has been owned by RiverOak Strategic Partners and is the subject of a Development Consent Order to be reopened as an airfreight hub. The DCO was granted by the Secretary of State for Transport in July 2020 and again in August 2022, with the most recent decision subject to a judicial review hearing in July 2023. The owners of the airport propose to reopen the airport for air cargo flights in 2028. 

==History==

===Origins===

At the outset of the First World War, the Isle of Thanet was equipped with a small and precarious landing strip for aircraft at St Mildred&#x27;s Bay, Westgate-on-Sea, on top of the chalk cliffs, at the foot of which was a promenade which had been used for seaplane operations. The landing grounds atop the cliff soon became the scene of several accidents, with one plane failing to stop before the end of the cliffs and tumbling into the sea, which, fortunately for the pilot, had been on its inward tide.

In the winter of 1915–1916, early aircraft began to use the open farmlands between Minster and Manston as a site for emergency landings. The Admiralty Aerodrome at Manston was opened in response. A training school, originally set up to instruct pilots in the use of the new Handley Page Type O bombers, was soon established. By the close of 1916, there were already two units stationed at Manston: the Operational War Flight Command and the Handley Page Training School.

Its location near the Kent coast gave Manston some advantages over other aerodromes, and regular additions in men and machinery were soon made, particularly from RAF Detling, in early days. By 1917 the Royal Flying Corps was well established and taking an active part in the defence of Britain.

===Battle of Britain and the Second World War===
Manston was used as a forward base by many squadrons during the Second World War, owing to its location close to the front line. It was frequently attacked and heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain. Barnes Wallis used the base to test his bouncing bomb on the coast at nearby Reculver, prior to the Dambusters raid.

Hawker Typhoon and Gloster Meteor squadrons were based at Manston during the war. On 27 July 1944, RAF 616 Squadron became the first allied jet equipped squadron in the world to become operational, using Meteors to intercept German V-1 flying bombs aimed at London. Manston&#x27;s position close to the front line and its long and broad three lane runway (built during the war, along with the runways at Woodbridge and Carnaby near Bridlington) meant the airfield was heavily used by badly damaged planes that had suffered from ground fire, collisions, or air attack. The airfield became a &quot;graveyard&quot; for heavy bombers and less-damaged aircraft, offering spare parts for allied aircraft in need of repair. The museum on site displays some aerial views dating from this era and the post-war years.

===Post-war military and civil use===
During the Cold War of the 1950s, the United States Air Force used Manston as a Strategic Air Command base for its fighter and fighter-bomber units. The USAF withdrew from Manston in 1960, and the airfield became a joint civilian and RAF airport, employed for occasional package tour and cargo flights, alongside its continuing role as an RAF base. Air Cadets used the northern side of the airfield as a gliding site, and an Air Experience Flight flying de Havilland Chipmunks was based there. Manston was used as a diversionary airfield for emergency military and civilian landings.

Manston became Kent International Airport from 1989, and a new terminal was opened by Sarah, Duchess of York. Summer season charter flights operated by Dan-Air to Palma, Mallorca were introduced on Saturdays, using BAC One-Elevens. The Yugoslavian carrier Aviogenex operated regular charters to the then-popular beach resorts of the then Yugoslavia on behalf of the now defunct Yugotours.

Kent International Airport was initially a civilian area within the former RAF Manston that included the existing terminal building and an apron where passengers embarked and freighters were loaded. The runway was not included within this enclave. In 1988, the owners of Kent International Airport signed a 125-year legal agreement with the RAF that obliged the RAF to maintain the runway, as well as to provide ongoing air traffic control and fire and rescue services. The cost of providing these was estimated at up to £3m per annum by the Ministry of Defence.

===Sale and commercial operations===
After an absence of regular charter services, Aspro Holidays operated a series of summer charter services during the 1992–93 summer season with its in-house airline Inter European Airways to Palma, Mallorca and Larnaca, Cyprus using the Boeing 737, and added a service to Heraklion, Crete, which was often operated using its larger Boeing 757 airliner. When Aspro was taken over by Airtours, the flights ceased. The early 1990s also saw weekly flights to Larnaca, Cyprus by Cypriana Holidays, with Eurocypria operating the inbound flight via Norwich as a split load. The service continued for approximately two summer seasons before Cypriana went into administration.

A 1993 report by the Department of Trade and Industry examined runway capacity in south east England and found Manston unsuitable for development as a major airport because of its proximity to a town. Nevertheless, in 1998, Thanet District Council produced the Isle of Thanet local plan, which recognised the economic development potential of abandoned sections of the old military airfield, particularly on its north-western edge. After the plan was published, the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to sell RAF Manston, and following a ruling by government instructing government departments to generate money through the sale of surplus assets, the MoD sold Manston.

After the RAF left, local Labour MP Stephen Ladyman opposed the decision to sell the base to property developer Wiggins Group plc. The RAF faced a compensation claim of £50–100 million if it then closed the base and terminated its earlier agreement with Kent International Airport. The MoD sold the site at the end of March 1999 for £4.75m to the Wiggins Group, which inherited the legal agreement obliging the RAF to continue maintenance of the airfield. Within six months, the RAF announced that it was leaving the airfield.

The airfield site comprises .

===Expansion===

In December 2003 a Government White Paper on The Future of Air Transport stated that Manston &quot;could play a valuable role in meeting local demand and could contribute to regional economic development&quot;, and would support development in principle, &quot;subject to relevant environmental considerations&quot;.

Development began in 2004 in an attempt to make it a budget airline hub. Irish airline EUjet, formed in 2002, began scheduled flights in September 2004 to UK destinations such as Manchester, Edinburgh, and international destinations Dublin and Geneva with a small fleet of Fokker 100 airliners. New car parks and a direct coach service from Bluewater via Chatham were introduced to support these flights.

In May 2004, the airport operator PlaneStation bought 30% of the shares in EUjet, and in January 2005 it completed its takeover by acquiring the remaining 70%. On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration and all EUjet flights ended, along with all non-freight operations at the airport, owing to financial difficulties with the airline and airport owner, PlaneStation. Its business plan was ambitious and when the bank lenders foreclosed many passengers were left stranded abroad. London Manston Airport plc went into liquidation. Operations then temporarily ceased, and Manston&#x27;s aerodrome traffic zone and radar services were suspended, until after a new buyer could be found.

The sale of Manston to Infratil, a company based in Wellington, New Zealand and owner of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, was completed on 26 August 2005. In July 2006 a charter route between Manston and Norfolk, Virginia, was announced: it was cancelled prior to commencement because of low bookings. It was to be operated by tour operator Cosmos in conjunction with Monarch Airlines.

Luxembourg-based Cargolux started flying for Ghana Airways from Accra to Kent International on 17 April 2007.

Charter flights were operated from Manston by Seguro Travel Ltd, operating as Kent Escapes. The 2007 Kent Escapes flights were operated by Sky Wings using a McDonnell Douglas MD-80. Seguro then swapped operators on 16 August and flights were taken over by BMI for a period. At the end of the season, flights were operated by Futura International Airways, a Spanish-based airline, using the Boeing 737. Futura ceased trading during September 2008 and Seguro on 10 September 2008.
On 15 February 2010, former airport CEO Matt Clarke and Flybe head of PR Niall Duffy announced a daily service operated by Flybe from Manston to Edinburgh, Kirkwall, and Sumburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. The services were the first daily scheduled routes at Manston since the collapse of EUjet in 2005. Dash-8Q400 aircraft were used. Air Southwest announced seasonal charter services to Jersey every Saturday using Dash-8 aircraft. The Flybe services to Kirkwall and Sumburgh were operated by the once-daily flight to Edinburgh and then by Loganair to the onward destinations.

Departures were offered during summer 2011 to Funchal, Madeira with specialist operator Atlantic Holidays, operated by UK charter airline Monarch Airlines but then discontinued.

Newmarket Holidays continued to offer irregular charter flights during the summer months to Verona and Naples in Italy, as well as Porto in Portugal using the Lithuanian charter airline Small Planet Airlines for the summer 2013 season.

Iran Air used Manston as a fuel stop for flight 710 from Heathrow to Tehran due to fuel disputes in London, until 1 December 2011.

=== Decline ===
On 22 December 2011, Flybe spokesman Niall Duffy announced that all Flybe services would cease from Manston Airport by 25 March 2012.

On 8 March 2012, Infratil announced it would dispose of its European airport operations, placing Kent International and Glasgow-Prestwick airports up for sale. Manston and Prestwick had been running at a loss, and in May 2011 Infratil&#x27;s annual report showed that losses from its European airports grew from £9 million to £11 million in 2010.

On 31 July 2012 a pressure group Why Not Manston? was formed, aiming to support greater use of Manston airport.

On 14 November 2012, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced twice daily flights from Manston to Amsterdam, with onward connections via the KLM network. The first flight was with a Fokker 70 on 2 April 2013.
From July 2013, British Airways has operated test flights and crew training for the Airbus A380 from Manston, which was followed by a similar exercise for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

On 15 October 2013, Infratil announced it would sell the airport to a company wholly owned by Ann Gloag, co-founder of Stagecoach Group. Manston Skyport Ltd took over running the former airport on 29 November 2013.

=== Closure ===
On 19 March 2014, it was announced that a 45-day consultation period into the closure of the former airport had begun. Daily losses were said to be £10,000. The airport&#x27;s chief executive announced that the airport could close on 9 April 2014, and on 25 March 2014 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced the end of its flights to Amsterdam by 10 April, and Manston&#x27;s last scheduled flight departed for Amsterdam on 9 April 2014.

On 12 April 2014, Newmarket Holidays said its Verona and Naples seasonal charter flights would move to the expanding Lydd Airport.

The closure of the former airport was announced on 6 May 2014; this took place on 15 May 2014.

=== Lorry park ===
On 31 July 2015, it was announced that the site might be used to house overflow lorries from Operation Stack, an emergency procedure to be used when services across the English Channel, such as those through the Channel Tunnel or from the Port of Dover, were disrupted. To prevent lorries from parking on the motorway during busy periods, freight traffic bound for the Port of Dover might be diverted to the airfield and held until it can be directed to the ferry services.

On 26 October 2016, local newspaper the &quot;Thanet Extra&quot; reported that the owners of the site had received payments totalling £3.539 million from the Department for Transport to keep Manston Airport on standby as a lorry park for Operation Stack.

Manston was switched to Operation Brock, a plan for the event of a no-deal Brexit, when it superseded Operation Stack in 2019. In December 2020, the airport runway was used as a lorry park when the French border was closed to traffic from the UK due to a new strain of coronavirus being found there.

=== Future ===

In July 2019, it was announced the airport may restart operations by 2022, its new owner RiverOak Strategic Partners (RSP) had revealed. RSP, a London-based company incorporated in 2016 specifically to reopen the Kent airport, told the BBC it planned &quot;short-haul and cargo flights&quot; at the site. The company confirmed in a statement dated 3 July that it would purchase the airport from the then owners Stone Hill Park (SHP), which had originally planned to develop the area into housing, a business park, a country park, and sports village.

In August 2022 RSP announced that it had received the redetermined Development Consent Order, from the Department for Transport. Following proposed investment of £500 million it expected to restart flights in 2025. now changed to 2028 if funding can be secured.

==Redevelopment proposals==
Following closure, a campaign was launched to reopen the airport, although the airport&#x27;s owner stated its intention to redevelop the site.

In 2014, an American private equity group, RiverOak Investments, put forward a proposal to acquire the site and reopen it as an airport, with an initial emphasis on cargo and the recycling of aircraft. This would have required the local council to use a compulsory purchase order (CPO), with RiverOak as indemnity partner, covering the costs incurred. In a council cabinet meeting on 11 December 2014, the Labour-controlled cabinet decided not to proceed with a CPO at the present time, stating
RiverOak being the only candidate in the initial soft market testing, no further action was to be taken on the CPO until other suitable candidates had been sought through a further round of soft market testing. After a change in the control of the local council in the 2015 elections, the newly elected council decided to look again at using a CPO to re-open the former airport.

Subsequent to the DfT report commissioned from PwC, into the decision not to proceed, a second examination of RiverOak took place, following the suggestions made by PwC. RiverOak failed to provide the information required by the council to proceed with a CPO, leading TDC to decline to proceed with a CPO using RiverOak as indemnity partner for a second time.

In December 2015, it was announced that RiverOak would undertake a Development Consent Order (DCO) process to acquire permission from central government to reopen the airport. A pre-application enquiry was made to the Planning Inspectorate in January 2016.

In June 2016, the site owner submitted a planning application to Thanet District Council, seeking permission for 2,500 homes, commercial sectors and public parkland, under the name Stone Hill Park.

The Planning Inspectorate launched an inquiry into the proposed change of use of buildings on the site from aviation to non-aviation in July 2016. In August 2016, Thanet Council commissioned AviaSolutions, an aviation consulting firm, to conduct a study into the feasibility of the site reopening as an airport.

During August 2016, the developers of the proposed Stone Hill Park criticised RiverOak, stating a belief that the company would develop Manston into a &quot;24/7 industrial scale cargo hub&quot;. This view was supported by a campaign group, No Night Flights, which also warned of daily and nightly flights to and from the airport. RiverOak subsequently made public a media statement discussing inaccuracies in the allegations by No Night Flights.

AviaSolutions released its findings in October 2016, stating that it did not believe an airport would be successful in the long-term on the site. RiverOak Strategic Partners responds to the Avia report saying that &quot;basic factual errors and questionable methodology, together with a decision to ignore six respected and publicly available air freight studies, has led to a set of conclusions about Manston Airport that are unsafe for Thanet Council to rely on and therefore render the report unusable.&quot;

In November 2016, it was made public that Edi Truell, a leading city financier and previously the pensions and investments adviser to the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, was keen to acquire Manston and return it to an operational airport. That month, the date for the public inquiry was announced as 24 January 2017 after the previous meeting due 1 November 2016 was postponed.

In February 2017, it became public that Disruptive Capital, with Edi Truell as chairman was to commission a report on its plans for Manston Airport. After a response to the news by Stone Hill Park, Truell made public his team&#x27;s investment in 14 airports around the world and $68 billion of long-term infrastructure investments.

In February 2017, RiverOak Strategic Partners spent its first day on site after gaining access to Manston Airport to carry out work as part of their development consent order (DCO).

In May 2017, it was announced that a new potential aviation investor was intending to approach Thanet District Council regarding a compulsory purchase order. Dale Crawford of DTD Consult is acting as spokesperson for the investment group, said to be a US logistics company with roots in Europe which already has plans to base 12 of its clients&#x27; aircraft at the site and able to invest over £100 million.

In July 2017 the Planning Inspectorate announced that, following its inquiry, it had thrown out the four applications for change of use of the Manston site to non-aviation uses.

In June and July 2017, almost 2,000 people attend statutory consultation meetings for RiverOak Strategic Partners&#x27; (RSP&#x27;s) proposals for Manston Airport. A further round of statutory consultation events is held in January and February 2018

The Development Consent Order examination stage closed on 9 July 2019 and permission was given for the sale to go ahead. The Development Consent Order was granted by the Transport Secretary in July 2020 but quashed by the High Court in February 2021 due to insufficient explanation of reasons to go against a 2019 examining authority report.

In August 2022, the minister again approved the DCO to bring the airfield back into use. A spokesman from RSP stressed their aim was to build an airport which was net zero-carbon from the start, and that because of the great shortage of air-freight capacity locally, considering mixed mode operations as a whole, cargo flights to/from the airport would actually reduce CO₂ emissions -- they claimed that most goods to/from SE England were trucked to French (and other nearby) airports for onward air freight. They said that once a plane was at its cruising altitude, it used less fuel than a set of trucks bearing the same goods by road, so if an item has to travel by air for some part of the journey, it is good to choose airports which minimise trucking distances.

In May 2024 a Judicial Review to challenge the reopening and redevelopment of Manston airport was rejected by the Court of Appeal in London which means that the DCO remains valid.

==Airline operations ==
At the time of closure, (April 2014), there were various cargo services and one passenger service (KLM to Amsterdam) operating from Manston. Cargo flights before closure were operated by Cargolux to Johannesburg–OR Tambo, Luxembourg, Maastricht and Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta; and by Saudia Cargo to Amsterdam, Dammam, Jeddah, Johannesburg–OR Tambo and Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta.

==Non-passenger operations==
Two museums, the RAF Manston History Museum and the Spitfire and Hurricane memorial, are located on the northern edge of the airfield.

The large hangar was originally built and used by Invicta International Airlines; between 1987 and 2004 Modern Jet Support Centre Ltd used it for Boeing 707 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 servicing, before entering administration; between 2006 and early 2009 it was used by airline DAS Air Cargo (which was taken over by Continental Aviation Services in November 2007) to maintain its aircraft as well as those of World Airways, Omni Air International, Gemini Air Cargo, and Avient Aviation, before entering administration. AvMan Engineering Ltd took over the hangar in 2009, and has CAA approval to work on BAe-146 and their ALF502 / LF507 engines.

A helicopter business remains operational, located immediately outside of the airport curtilage.

A second helicopter business, Polar helicopters, remains operational on the airfield and provides a radio service for overflying aircraft.

==Search and rescue base==

RAF Manston was home to a helicopter search and rescue (SAR) flight from No. 22 Squadron RAF from 1961, operating Westland Whirlwind HAR.2/HAR.10 aircraft. The flight was withdrawn in 1969, but an outcry led to the RAF contracting Bristow Helicopters from 1971 to 1974 to provide a continuing service (using Whirlwind Series 3s). In 1972, the Bristow crew was awarded the Wreck Shield for Most Meritorious Rescue in 1972 by the Department of Trade and Industry.

The RAF returned in 1974, with No. 72 Squadron RAF operating two Westland Wessex HC.2 aircraft to replace the Bristow operation. The flight was transferred back to No. 22 Squadron in June 1976. In 1988 No. 202 Squadron RAF moved to Manston with its Westland Sea King HAR.3, when the Wessex helicopters moved to RAF Coltishall. The Sea Kings remained at Manston until July 1994, when the SAR base closed, transferring SAR English Channel coverage to RAF Wattisham.

It was announced that Manston would be a location for the new 10-year SAR contract, operated by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Manston was intended to have a new £7 million, custom built facility operational from April 2015, hosting two new AgustaWestland AW189 helicopters. These plans were cancelled after the airport&#x27;s closure was announced.

==Constraints==
Manston&#x27;s flight path passed over the town of Ramsgate, a seaside resort of some 40,000 residents, situated about from the eastern end of the runway. To one side of the runway lies the village of Cliffsend, whose housing is less than from it. Manston village stands to the northeast of the passenger terminal.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 11 August 2010 a Douglas DC-8-63F YA-VIC of Afghanistan&#x27;s Kam Air suffered a tailstrike on take-off, destroying an approach light. The aircraft was operating an international cargo flight from Manston to Buenos Aires via the Cape Verde Islands. The incident was caused by excess fuel, and an underestimation of the mass of the cargo, making the aircraft overweight. After being informed of the tailstrike, the crew continued the flight to the Cape Verde Islands. Inspection on arrival revealed that a tailstrike had indeed occurred, although the tailstrike indicator was within limits.

The incident was investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which made four safety recommendations. As a direct result, Kam Air was banned from operating within the European Union. The three crew were dismissed, and Kam Air announced that it would withdraw its two DC-8s from service.

<doc id="710842" wikidata="Q179833" url="?curid=710842" title="Sumgait">
<text>Sumgait (; , ) is a city in Azerbaijan, located near the Caspian Sea, on the Absheron Peninsula, about away from the capital Baku. The city had a population of 422,600 at the 2019 Census, (excluding the population in the occupied territories at the time of Census) making it the second largest city in Azerbaijan after Baku.

The city has a territory of . It was founded as a suburb of Baku in 1944 and received city status on 22 November 1949, growing into a major industrial center during the Soviet period. The municipality of Sumgait also includes the settlements of Jorat and Haji Zeynalabdin. It is home to Sumqayit State University.

== Etymology ==
The name of city comes from the name of the Mongolian tribe Sugaut (Sagait).

According to local folklore the city is named after the Sumgait River. One folk legend tells the tale of a hero by the name of &quot;Sum&quot;, who is chosen by the community to fight a monster that was blocking the Sumgait River. Sum eventually manages to kill the monster, but when the river is released he is swept away by the waters and never seen again. After that, his beloved, Jeyran, inconsolable due to Sum&#x27;s disappearance, would go to the river and cry &quot;Sum qayıt!&quot; (which means &quot;Sum, come back!&quot; in Azerbaijani). So the river became known as Sumgait, after which the city was named.

== History ==
=== Medieval era ===
According to historians, Medean tribes lived in the area in ancient times. During the construction boom, when the foundation of the executive power building was being excavated, remains of an ancient caravanserai along with personal items and kitchenware was found at the site.

The first reports of settlements at the present site of Sumgait were in 1580, when English traveller H. Barrow mentioned Sumgait in his writings and in 1858, when Alexander Dumas wrote about the area in his memoirs &quot;Trip to Caucasus&quot;, although nothing substantial was created on the site until the Soviet Union gained control over the area in the 1920s.

=== Soviet period ===
Following the politics of &quot;glasnost&quot;, initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region of the Azerbaijani SSR.

The Sumgait pogrom against the local Armenian population on 27–29 February 1988 was one of the first violent events of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It killed more than 30 people, wounded some 200, and produced thousands of refugees; most of the victims were Armenians who constituted a large minority of the population.

=== Republic era ===
After the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, the city became home to a number of Azerbaijani refugees internally displaced persons, mainly from Qubadli and Zengilan regions. In 1994, Heydar Aliyev initiated a large-scale Free Economic Area project on the territory of the city.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
=== Environment ===
As a result of the Soviet planning of the industrial boom era, the city became heavily polluted. Soon after Azerbaijan&#x27;s independence, the industrial sectors went into decline. The Absheron Peninsula (which consists of Sumgait, Baku and the Absheron District) was considered by scientists to be the most ecologically devastated part of Azerbaijan. The city was known for its children&#x27;s cemetery, known as the &quot;Baby Cemetery&quot; which contains many graves of infants born with deformities and mental retardation that were further complicated by the lack of adequate medical care for the poor. Sumgait was named as most polluted place on Earth by the U.S.-based environmental group the Blacksmith Institute in 2006 and placed on their list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Polluted Places&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2007. The report noted the former Soviet industrial base was polluting the local environment with industrial chemicals like chlorine and heavy metals. The report also mentioned cancer rates in Sumgait were as much as 51% higher than the national average and that genetic mutations and birth defects were commonplace.
The city administration prepared an environmental protection plan for 2003–2010 which has been steadily decreasing the levels of pollution to minimal. The program oversees 118 activities aimed at minimizing pollution at all possible levels of economic production. The program was prepared with the participation of all industrial enterprises in the city and its enforcement is being regulated by the executive power of the city. For instance, the amount of wastewater from industrial production went down from during the 1990s to in 2005. Solid waste went down from 300,000 to 3,868 tons a year. The World Bank has issued a loan to the Azerbaijani government for construction of a burial range for mercury waste.

== Administrative divisions ==

The municipality of Sumgait consists of the city of Sumgait and the municipalities of Jorat and Haji Zeynalabdin. Executive power in the city is held by the mayor, presently Zakir Ferejov.

== Demographics ==
According to the State Statistics Committee, as of 2018, the population of city was 341,200 people, having increased by 84,500 (about 33 percent) from 256,700 people in 2000. The population consists of 168,300 men and 172,900 women. More than 23 percent of the population consists of young people and teenagers aged 14–29.
===Ethnic composition===
Azerbaijanis comprise 85% of the population, Talysh 5%, Lezgins 5%, Russians 2%, Turkish 1%, and others 2%. Prior to February 1988, Sumgait was home to 20,000 Armenians, who were displaced as a result of the Sumgait pogrom.

=== Religion ===
Sumgait did not have a mosque until after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the 2010s, the city emerged as a center for Salafism in Azerbaijan, a form of Sunni Islam that advocates a return to Islam&#x27;s earliest practices. The Syrian Civil War and emergence of ISIL forced authorities to take action on crackdown of perceived religious radicals in Sumgait.

== Economy ==

In 1935, the Soviet government decided to develop heavy industry in the Absheron Peninsula, and the future location of Sumgait was chosen based on its proximity to Baku and its key position on the existing railroad lines.

Between 1938 and 1941, a thermal power station was constructed to power Baku&#x27;s growing petroleum industry. This was soon followed by more heavy industries. Due to World War II the construction of the area stopped and resumed in 1944 when metallurgical and chemical plants were constructed and put into operation. The first production of &quot;Sumgait Chemical Plant&quot; led to a rapid growth and construction boom, creating a new job market, and a need for a resident population. In 1949, Sumgait gained official city status according to the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR. In 1952, a tube-rolling plant delivered its first produce thus developing black metallurgy production in Azerbaijan. The same year, another new Synthetic Rubber Production Plant started its operations producing ethylene obtained from oil. Operations at &quot;Sumgait Steel Processing Plant&quot; and &quot;Sumgait Aluminium Plant&quot; were commenced in 1953 and 1955, respectively. In 1957–1955, a number of scientific research facilities and cultural centres were built, leading to further development of the city infrastructure. In 1960, authorities started building the Petroleum Chemical Factory, the largest in Europe at the time. From 1961 through 1968, a brick-producing factory, a polymer construction materials industrial complex, a phosphor production plant were built. In the 1970–80s, light industry and mechanical engineering facilities were added to the industrial base of the city. By the end of the 1980s, Sumgait was already the centre of the chemical industry of the USSR.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Sumgait has remained Azerbaijan&#x27;s second-biggest industrial centre after Baku. Some of the most significant companies operating in the city are Azerpipe, Azeraluminium, Sumgait Aluminium, Sumgait Superphosphate, glass producer Khazar OJSC, Sumgait Knitted Goods Factory, and Sumgait Compressors, many of which have been privatized.

In 2011, the development of Sumgait Technologies Park (STP) and Sumgayit Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP) started to receive investor attention. The complex will host pharmaceutical, construction, and agricultural businesses, in addition to chemical, automotive, and electronics producers. It is meant as a self-sufficient complex, which will include residential facilities, an exhibition center, laboratories, sports center, schools, and hospitals. SCIP aims to attract domestic and foreign investors, and its management has already received proposals for 20 investment projects in the complex.

The flora of the park includes 39 types of trees. Events of the 1990s, such as the Black January tragedy and First Nagorno-Karabakh War, led to the establishment of &quot;Stars&quot; (Ulduzlar) and &quot;20 January Monument&quot; monuments in the park. In the eastern section of the park, Shehidler Khiyabani, similar to Martyrs&#x27; Lane in Baku, was established as a burial ground for thousands of soldiers from Sumgait who died during the war.

<doc id="710861" wikidata="Q1210146" url="?curid=710861" title="Lions (United Rugby Championship)">
<text>The Lions (known as the Emirates Lions for sponsorship reasons) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Johannesburg in the Gauteng province. They competed in the Super Rugby competition until 2020, and have competed in the United Rugby Championship since 2021. They are the successor of the teams known as Transvaal (1996), Gauteng Lions (1997) and the Cats (1998–2006).

They had varied results in Super Rugby, finishing at the bottom of the table six times (in 1998, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012), but reaching the semifinal stage five times (in 2000, 2001, 2016, 2017 and 2018). They reached their first final in 2016 – where they lost to the 20–3 in Wellington – The Lions made the final again in 2017 but this time on their own ground but unfortunately lost again against the mighty Crusaders with the final score being 17-25.The team reached their 3rd consecutive final in 2018 when they lost against the 38–17 in Christchurch that left most questioning if the shortfall was due to Jaco not being picked for the match and if the Lions only real threatening player was Jaco Strydom . The team plays its home matches at Ellis Park Stadium.

The team faced relegation from the Super 14 after the Southern Spears won a court ruling that they should be included in the competition in place of the lowest ranked South African team in the 2006 competition. However, the Spears and the country&#x27;s national federation, the South African Rugby Union, reached a settlement of their legal case. By the terms of the settlement, announced on 16 November 2006, the financially troubled Spears abandoned their case.

As part of a second attempt to introduce Super Rugby into the Eastern Cape, the South African Rugby Union mandated that the Lions, who finished bottom of the 2012 Super Rugby table, would be replaced in the 2013 competition by the Southern Kings from Port Elizabeth. The Lions&#x27; exclusion lasted just one season as they regained their place in Super Rugby for the 2014 season by beating the Southern Kings in a two leg playoff after the Kings finished bottom of the 2013 South African conference.

==History==
===Transvaal (1993–1995)===
The Super 10 was a rugby union tournament featuring ten teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tonga, and Western Samoa. The competition ran for three years from 1993 to 1995 and was the predecessor of the Super 12 and Super 14, now known as Super Rugby.
Transvaal won the competition in 1993 beating Auckland 20–17 at Ellis Park in the final after winning all four their pool games and were finalists again in 1995, losing to Queensland.

===Transvaal/Gauteng Lions (1996–1997)===
When the Super 12 was launched in 1996, both Australia and New Zealand created franchise-based models for their teams in the new tournament. South Africa used the previous seasons Currie Cup to determine what provinces would play in the new international tournament. Transvaal played in the first ever season, winning three of their 11 fixtures, finishing in 10th position on the end of season ladder, above the Canterbury Crusaders and the Western Province.

Transvaal were again promoted to the Super 12 for the 1997 season, and played under the title of the Gauteng Lions. The Lions&#x27; season was a lot more successful than their results in the inaugural season. The Lions won and lost five matches, and drawing one, to finish in fifth place overall on the end of season table, two points behind the fourth-placed Natal Sharks, narrowly missing out on a place in the finals.

===Cats (1998–2005)===
For the 1998 season SA Rugby changed the Currie Cup qualification process for the Super 12, following Australia and New Zealand by forming provincial franchises. The Cats, or Golden Cats were established as one of the four new franchises, and were centered around the Golden Lions, as well as the Leopards and Pumas, as well as drawing from the Free State, Griffons and Griquas. The Cats home ground was to be shared between Ellis Park and the Free State Stadium.

The Cats did not make the finals in their first two seasons, but the appointment of former New Zealand coach Laurie Mains for the 2000 season signalled a change in fortunes. After defeating the Bulls in Pretoria in the opening round, they also defeated the Stormers at home in round two. However, the Cats&#x27; good fortunes soon went sour as they fell to four straight losses, even going down 64–0 to the Brumbies. The losing streak was snapped when the Cats pulled off a one-point victory over the Sharks in Durban. Following a bye, the Cats stormed through the remainder of the season undefeated to finish in fourth position, their best finish yet, as well as qualifying for a semi-final.

The semi-final was played at the Brumbies&#x27; home ground in Canberra, with the homeside winning 28–3 to knock the Cats out of the finals. The 2001 Super 12 season started off in a positive style for the Cats; defeating the Stormers 29–24, and then crushing the Highlanders 56–21, as well as narrowly losing a reply of last season&#x27;s semi-final against the Brumbies 19–17. The Cats qualified for the finals again, finishing in third place bettering last season&#x27;s fourth. However, they were again knocked out in the semi-finals, losing 30–12, this time to the Sharks. The Cats did not qualify for the finals the next few seasons. Then the Super 12 was expanded into the Super 14 for the 2006 season, with the addition of two new teams; the Cheetahs and the Western Force. The Cats finished in 13th place overall.

===Lions (2006–present)===
On 8 September 2006, the Golden Lions Rugby Union, the union that at the time operated both the Golden Lions and the Cats, announced that the team would be known in the future as the Lions, and unveiled a new logo.

During the 2010 Super 14 season, the Lions lost all 13 games of the season, setting a new record. The previous record was held by the Bulls, with 0 wins from the 11-game season in 2002. On 20 January 2011, the club announced a 3-year sponsorship deal with telecoms company MTN. From 2011 to 2012 they were known as the MTN Lions for sponsorship reasons. Ivor Ichikowitz and Robert Gumede pledged to purchase a 49.9% stake in the club through their investment company GumaTac in October 2010. The deal fell apart in 2011 due to differences with GLRU executives. In February 2011, the club signed Springbok fly-half Butch James among other high-profile signings Lionel Mapoe, Pat Cilliers and Rory Kockott.

====Relegation and Lions Challenge Series, 2012–====
After finishing on the bottom of the Super Rugby table for the third time in five seasons, South African Rugby Union (SARU) officials voted in August 2012 to relegate the Lions from the competition and promote the Eastern Cape-based Southern Kings. On 10 January 2013, the GLRU launched a schedule of 16 matches called the 2013 Lions Challenge Series. This series would begin on 19 January against Russia, and conclude on 20 July against Top 14 team Grenoble, to be followed by the Super Rugby promotion/relegation play-off.
At the launch of the series, President Kevin de Klerk said:
We took major umbrage to the decision made in Cape Town last year to relegate us, and the easy route would have been to play the blame game and look for scapegoats... But we have decided to get on with the rugby and ensure we continue to serve our stakeholders.&quot;
Several of the scheduled Lions Challenge games, including a proposed tour to the United States, never took place. Thus the idea of a Challenge Series was perceived to have failed. But despite not having the best lead up to the important Super Rugby promotion match-up with the Southern Kings later that year, the Lions ended up winning the two legged series. Thus they were promoted back into Super Rugby for 2014.

====Resurgence: 2014–present====
Determined to establish themselves as a top team in Super Rugby, the Lions made wholesale changes to the team, including hiring Johan Ackermann and Swys de Bruin as main coaches, overhauling much of the playing squad, and adopting a much more open and fluid playing style. The Lions returned to Super Rugby by defeating the Cheetahs in their first match back in the competition. They ended up winning 7 out of 16 matches and ended 12th, above the Reds, Cheetahs and Rebels.
The 2015 season brought even more success to the union as they won 9 out of 16 matches, including 3 out of 4 matches on tour to Australasia. The Lions lost out to a spot in the play-offs when they drew to the Stormers in their final group stage match.
The 2016 season was expanded to 18 teams with the Jaguares (Argentina), Sunwolves (Japan) and Southern Kings (South Africa) joining the competition. The Lions would start the season on tour beating the Sunwolves and Chiefs but losing to the Highlanders in the final game. The Lions would go on to win 11 out of 15 matches in the group stages to top the Africa 2 conference and top the Africa group and were awarded with their first conference trophy. They ended 2nd on the overall log and qualified for their first knockout match since being re-branded as the Lions. In the quarter-final they beat the Crusaders and the Highlanders in the semi-final to qualify for their first final since the current Super Rugby competition began in 1996. On 6 August they played in the final against The Hurricanes away from home with cold, wet and windy conditions that would favor the home team, as they lost 20–3.
In the 2017 season the Lions would get an easier draw, which meant they only had to face Australian teams and no New Zealand teams. With this advantage they would win 14 out of 15 matches, only losing one game away from home to the Jaguares due to sending another weaker team to Argentina. The Lions would not regret the decision as they would top the overall log to gain home advantage throughout the playoffs. The Lions would go on to beat the Sharks in the quarter-final and were tasked to face their first New Zealand opposition in the semi-final, the Hurricanes, whom they would defeat. The Lions became only the second South African franchise since the Bulls (2009, 2010) to qualify for back-to-back finals. They hosted the final at Emirates Airline Park against the Crusaders (setting the record for attendance at a Super Rugby final in the process), but lost 25–17 as they were forced to play much of the match short-handed after second-rower Kwagga Smith was sent off for a late tackle in the air. This was Ackermann&#x27;s final game as head coach, having previously accepted a move to Aviva Premiership side Gloucester Rugby for 2017-18: de Bruin was promoted as his replacement for 2018.

===Season summaries===
The following table summarises the Lions&#x27; results in their Super Rugby seasons:

==Location==
They are based in New Doornfontein, Johannesburg, and have always been centred around the Lions union (Johannesburg), drawing players from that union since the inception of the competition as Super 12 in 1996.

Through 2005, the Cats also drew players from the two unions based in Free State —the Free State Cheetahs (Bloemfontein) and Griffons (Welkom)— and the Griquas (Northern Cape). That arrangement ended when the Cheetahs were admitted to the competition.

Starting in 2006, they drew players from the Leopards (North West) and Pumas (Mpumalanga) unions, which previously were in the franchise areas of the Bulls.

From the start of 2017, they could only draw players from the Griquas (Northern Cape).

As of 2020, only players contracted by the Lions franchise were drawn.

===Stadium===
The Lions&#x27; home ground is Ellis Park Stadium (known for sponsorship reasons as Emirates Airline Park), named after an employee from the Johannesburg City Council, Mr JD Ellis, with whom the rugby union negotiated to acquire the land on which the stadium is built. Ellis Park has hosted a number of memorable matches including the 1995 Rugby World Cup final, which was played between the All Blacks and South Africa, which saw South Africa win the William Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.

==Current squad==

The Lions squad for the 2024–25 United Rugby Championship is.

==Captains==
==Coaches==
The current head coach of the Lions super rugby team is Ivan van Rooyen, who has taken over from Swys de Bruin.

<text>Sîn-lēqi-unninni ( ) was a &quot;mašmaššu&quot; who lived in Mesopotamia, probably in the period between 1300 BC and 1000 BC. He is traditionally thought to have compiled the best-preserved version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. His name is listed in the text itself, which was unorthodox for works written in cuneiform. His version is known by its &quot;incipit,&quot; or first line &quot;ša nagba īmuru&quot; (&quot;He who saw the deep&quot; or &quot;The one who saw the Abyss&quot;). The extent to which his version is different from earlier texts is unknown; Andrew R. George argues that Sîn-lēqi-unninni &quot;gave [The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;] its final, fixed form&quot;. Tigay acknowledges that Sîn-lēqi-unninni shifted &quot;Gilgamesh&#x27;s greatness from deeds to the acquisition of knowledge&quot;. At time it was also known as &quot;Gilgamesh series&quot; (&quot;iškar Gilgāmeš&quot;).

The prologue features the only instance of first person narration by Sîn-lēqi-unninni. His version includes Utnapishtim&#x27;s story of the Flood in tablet XI and, in tablet XII, the Sumerian &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot;.

Sîn-lēqi-unninni&#x27;s name means &#x27;Sîn (the Moon God) is one who accepts my prayer&#x27;. It is also sometimes transcribed, albeit less probably, as &#x27;Sîn-liqe-unninni&#x27;, meaning &#x27;O Sîn! Accept my prayer&#x27;. Several Úruk families in the Neo-Babylonian, Achaemenid and Seleucid periods claimed Sîn-lēqi-unninni as their ancestor, specifically those who acted as scribes and &quot;kalû&quot;, creating something of a &quot;dynasty of intellectuals&quot;. Sîn-lēqi-unninni may have been a legendary figure, with a list from the first millennium B.C. describing him as &quot;Gilgamesh&#x27;s wise councilor&quot;.

<doc id="710867" wikidata="Q338427" url="?curid=710867" title="Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby">
<text>Edward George Villiers Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby (4 April 1865 – 4 February 1948), styled The Hon. Edward Stanley from 1886–93 and Lord Stanley from 1893 to 1908, was a British peer, soldier, Conservative politician, diplomat and racehorse owner. He was twice Secretary of State for War and also served as British Ambassador to France.

==Early life and education==
Stanley was born at 23 St James&#x27;s Square, London, the eldest son of Hon. Frederick Stanley (later the 16th Earl of Derby) by his wife, Lady Constance Villiers. Frederick Stanley was the second son of Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, who was three times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Villiers was the daughter of the Liberal statesman George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. Edward Stanley was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, where he boarded as a pupil of Stanley House, named in honour of his paternal grandfather the 14th Earl.

==Military career==
Stanley initially received a lieutenant&#x27;s commission in a militia unit, the 3rd Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) (commanded by his father), on 4 May 1882, and then joined the Grenadier Guards as a lieutenant from 6 May 1885. He was seconded as aide-de-camp to the Governor General of Canada, his father, between 8 August 1889 and 1891. He was again seconded from his regiment on 10 July 1892, to take his seat in the House of Commons. He resigned his commission on 3 April 1895.

On 11 January 1899, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the reserve of officers, and on 17 May, was made honorary colonel of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. Lord Stanley served on the staff in the Second Boer War, and was appointed Chief Press Censor at Cape Town, graded as assistant adjutant-general, on 18 January 1900. He accompanied Lord Roberts&#x27;s headquarters as Press Censor when he left Cape Town, and was mentioned in despatches of 31 March 1900 by Roberts for his &quot;tact and discretion&quot; in that role. He was appointed Roberts&#x27; private secretary on 25 July 1900. and was again mentioned in despatches of 2 April 1901 for his &quot;thorough knowledge of men and affairs&quot;. He was appointed honorary colonel of the 6th (Militia) Battalion, Manchester Regiment on 24 December 1902, of the 5th Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) in the Territorial Force (TF) on 15 June 1908 (the fourth successive Earl of Derby to hold the appointment), of the 4th and 5th TF Battalions of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment on 18 June 1909 and 17 May 1899 respectively, and of the Lancashire and Cheshire Heavy Brigade, Royal Artillery on 26 February 1921.

==Political career==
Derby entered Parliament for Westhoughton in 1892, and served under Lord Salisbury as a Lord of the Treasury between 1895 and 1900 and under Salisbury and later Arthur Balfour as Financial Secretary to the War Office between 1901 and 1903. In October 1903 he entered the cabinet as Postmaster General, a post he held until the government fell in December 1905. He lost his seat in the 1906 general election. In 1908 he succeeded his father in the earldom and took his seat in the House of Lords.
In August 1914 Lord Derby organised one of the most successful recruitment campaigns to Kitchener&#x27;s Army in Liverpool. Over two days, 1500 Liverpudlians joined the new battalion. Speaking to the men he said: &quot;This should be a battalion of pals, a battalion in which friends from the same office will fight shoulder to shoulder for the honour of Britain and the credit of Liverpool.&quot; Within the next few days, three more pals battalions were raised in Liverpool. In October 1915, as Director-General of Recruiting, he instituted the Derby Scheme, a halfway house between voluntary enlistment and conscription (which the Government was reluctant to adopt). It was not sufficiently successful in spite of the fact that the execution of Nurse Edith Cavell by the Germans on 12 October 1915 was used in recruitment rallies and conscription followed in 1916.

In July 1916 Derby returned to the government when he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War by H. H. Asquith, and in December 1916 he was promoted to Secretary of State for War by David Lloyd George. In this position he was a strong supporter of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir William Robertson and of the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, Field Marshal Haig. Haig privately had little respect for him, writing to his wife (10 January 1918) that Derby was &quot;like the feather pillow, bear[ing] the mark of the last person who sat on him&quot; and remarking that he was known in London as the &quot;genial Judas&quot;. Robertson&#x27;s biographer writes that during the crisis over Robertson&#x27;s removal Derby &quot;made himself ridiculous&quot; by asking everyone, including the King, whether or not he should resign, and then in the end not doing so, only to be removed from the War Office a few weeks later.

Derby and John Joseph Woodward (who was also secretary) jointly founded the ex-servicemen&#x27;s organisation, the Comrades of the Great War in 1917 as a right-wing alternative to the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers (NADSS) and the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers (NFDSS), the latter of whom had put a candidate up against his son Lord Stanley in the 1917 Liverpool Abercromby by-election. The rival groups later merged into the British Legion formed in 1921.

In April 1918 he was made Ambassador to France, which he remained until 1920. In April 1921 he was sent secretly to Ireland for talks with Éamon de Valera, and it is likely that these talks paved the way for the truce which in turn led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He again served as Secretary of State for War under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin from 1922 to 1924. Derby was made a CB in 1900, sworn of the Privy Council in 1903, KCVO in 1905 and a GCVO in 1908, Knight of the Garter in 1915, GCB in 1920. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Manchester in 1934.

==Other public positions==
Derby was Lord Mayor of Liverpool between 1911 and 1912. He served as honorary president of the Rugby Football League, and donated a cup for the French authorities to use for a knock-out competition, much as his father had done for ice hockey with the Stanley Cup. This is now known as the Lord Derby Cup. Between 1937 and 1947 he was the president of the National Playing Fields Association (now renamed Fields in Trust). He was also, from 1929 to 1945, the chairman of the Pilgrims Society, becoming their president, until his death in 1948. Derby served as East Lancashire Provincial Grand Master of Freemasonry from 1899 until his death. He also held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire between 1928 and 1948. Another contribution made to English rugby league was the match between St Helens and Wigan being named &#x27;the derby&#x27; as the clubs reside in opposite ends of Lord Derby&#x27;s estate, this is a term used globally between rival clubs from a similar location however there is only one domestic league match named &#x27;the Derby&#x27;.

==Horse racing==

The Epsom Derby was named after the 12th Earl while The Oaks was named after the 12th Earl&#x27;s house near Epsom. Derby followed the family tradition and was one of the most prominent owner breeders during the first half of the 20th century. Among his stables&#x27; important wins were:

* Epsom Derby (3): 1924, 1933, 1942
* Epsom Oaks (2): 1928, 1945
* St. Leger Stakes (6): 1910, 1919, 1923, 1928, 1933, 1943
* 1,000 Guineas (7): 1916, 1918, 1923, 1930, 1936, 1943, 1945
* 2,000 Guineas (2): 1926, 1944

Amidst great fanfare that included making the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, in 1930 the 17th Earl visited Louisville, Kentucky, with Joseph E. Widener where he was the honoured guest of Churchill Downs president Col. Matt Winn at the 56th running of the Kentucky Derby.

His biggest achievement, though, was his breeding of the horse Phalaris. A champion sprinter and a stallion par excellence, Phalaris was responsible for establishing the most dominant sire line in Europe and later, the United States through his four sons – Sickle, Pharamond, Pharos and Fairway.

==Marriage and issue==
Lord Derby married Lady Alice Montagu, daughter of William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, and Louisa von Alten, and step-daughter of the leading Liberal politician Lord Hartington, at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, on 5 January 1889. Lady Alice was also a lady-in-waiting to her friend, Queen Alexandra.

The couple had three children together:

*Lady Victoria Alice Louisa (24 June 1892 – 26 November 1927); married firstly in 1915 Liberal politician Neil Primrose (1882–1917); married secondly in 1919 the Conservative politician Malcolm Bullock. 
*Edward, Lord Stanley (1894–1938), father of John Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby 
*Hon. Oliver Stanley (4 May 1896 – 10 December 1950), married in 1920 Lady Maureen Vane-Tempest-Stewart, daughter of 7th Marquess of Londonderry and the Hon. Edith Chaplin

Their two sons achieved the rare distinction of sitting in the same Cabinet between May and October 1938 until Edward&#x27;s death. Their only daughter, Lady Victoria, died aged 35, from a fractured skull sustained in a horse-riding accident caused by striking her head on a low iron railway arch.

Lord Derby died in February 1948 at the family seat of Knowsley Hall, Lancashire, aged 82. His other country seat was Coworth Park at Sunningdale in Berkshire. He was succeeded in the earldom by his grandson, Edward. He is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Knowsley. The Countess of Derby died in July 1957.

==Legacy==
Many good stories are told of Lord Derby, including the following, which is surely apocryphal not least because he was a man of utter probity. He was spotted by a steward feeding one of his horses shortly before the start of a race. When challenged, His Lordship explained the substance was sugar, and promptly ate a lump himself to show that it was innocuous. &quot;Keep the creature on a tight rein until a furlong out, then let him have his head, He&#x27;ll do the rest&quot;. His Lordship added, almost as an afterthought: &quot;If you hear anything coming up behind you, don&#x27;t worry and don&#x27;t turn round, it will only be me&quot;.
A county directory of 1903 describes Coworth House as &quot;an ancient building standing in a thickly wooded park&quot;. As Derby also owned Knowsley Hall in Lancashire, his principal country seat, and a London townhouse in Stratford Place, St James&#x27;s, Coworth tended to be occupied only during Ascot race meetings. The Derby landholdings in 1833 consisted of some seventy thousand acres in Lancashire, Cheshire, Surrey and Kent in England and Flintshire in Wales, but not a single acre in Derbyshire. The Landholding produced a rent-roll of £163,273 p.a.
On 9 January 1923, the Earl sold 143 acres of land known as the Keston Lodge Estate in Kent for £6000 to the property developer Frederick Rogers who renamed it Keston Park.

Coworth House continued with Lord Derby until his death in 1948. It then became the home of Lady Derby, who died there on 24 July 1957, aged ninety-four. A month later her former home was advertised for sale in &quot;The Times&quot;; and at this or a subsequent date was converted to use as a Roman Catholic convent school. The next owner is thought to have been Vivian &#x27;White&#x27; Lloyd who died in 1972.

==Screen portrayals==
Lord Derby was portrayed by Frank Middlemass in an episode of the 1981 TV miniseries &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot;.

<text>Skycity Auckland is an entertainment complex and casino in the central business district of Auckland, New Zealand, between Victoria and Federal Streets. Located at the base of the Sky Tower, it was the second casino in New Zealand, and is the only casino in Auckland.

==Facilities==
The complex includes the Sky Tower, the Sky City Theatre with an auditorium with 700-seats, many bars and restaurants, and three hotels, with one scheduled to open in 2021. The casino was last refurbished in 2006, and has approximately 1,600 gambling machines, 100 gambling tables and rooms for VIP / high-stakes gamblers.

In September 2013, it was announced that Skycity Auckland had purchased a 21m motor yacht &quot;Horizon II&quot; for corporate entertainment.

In February 2018, Skycity Auckland opened New Zealand&#x27;s first purpose-built e-sports broadcasting studio, located on Level 2 of the Sky Tower, formerly known as XO Bar.

==History==

The Sky Tower, convention centre and hotel were all built by Fletcher Construction and completed by 1997.

Skycity&#x27;s casino was the second casino in the country. At the time of its construction, it was controversial, just like the Sky Tower itself. Unlike the city&#x27;s icon towering above it, major figures like former Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard have remained critical of the casino, though he acknowledged that the complex itself has been positive for the city. However, there is criticism from various sources that the casino creates problem gambling and does not ban problem gamblers proactively enough.

The casino provides almost 2000 jobs and has returned NZD $670 million in dividends to mainly Australian shareholders, from more than eight million visitors that have passed through, 15% from overseas. NZD $18.6 million was also paid to community organisations and trusts in the same time. 1.5% of the operating profit has to be paid out to charity according to law.

With profits at its parent, the Skycity Entertainment Group falling, it was announced in May 2007 that around 230 staff of SkyCity Auckland would be let go within the following 12–18 months, though it was thought likely to be mostly through turnover attrition, and would be focused on management staff.

On 11 May 2020, SkyCity announced that it would be slashing 700 jobs as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. A month earlier, SkyCity had slashed 200 jobs.

On 9 May 2024, SkyCity Auckland agreed to close for five days after failing to stop a problem gambler from spending over a NZ$1 million in pokies.

==Hotels==
Skycity Hotel, Auckland is a four-star hotel and was opened in January 1996. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s busiest hotels and is located inside the main Auckland complex and serves mainly families, business travellers and gamblers who play at the casino. It offers 323 rooms which were refurbished in 2013. Hotel guests may use all the facilities in the complex.

The Grand by Skycity is a luxury 5 star hotel which was officially opened by Prime Minister Helen Clark in April 2005 after costing $85 million to construct. It is not located inside the main complex but is located on Federal Street which is adjacent and is also connected by a skybridge.

== Events ==
In 2019, the Skycity Convention Centre played host to two world boxing title events, promoted by Bruce Glozier and Steve Deane of Rival Sports Promotions. The first event took place on March 30 Geovana Peres took on Lani Daniels for the WBO World women&#x27;s light heavyweight title dubbed History in the making. The event sold out with 680 table tickets and was prerecorded to broadcast on Sky Sports TV later in the week. On 30 July, Bruce Glozier of Rival Sports Promotion announced the second world title event, Geovana Peres vs Claire Hafner. As part of promoting the event, Geovana Peres did a world first by doing boxing pad work outside on top of the Sky Tower, 193 metres in the air. The event sold out with over 1000 tickets and was broadcast live on Sky Sports 3 TV.

== New convention centre ==
In May 2013, the Government came to a deal with Skycity to build a new convention centre worth $402 million in exchange for gambling concessions. The concessions would allow Skycity to install an extra 230 poker machines, 40 gambling tables, as well as a further 12 gambling tables that could be substituted for automated table game player stations (but not poker machines). Skycity would also receive an extension to their casino licence, from its expiry in 2021 until 2048. In exchange, Skycity would be required to meet the full costs of the convention centre project.

Describing the benefit for New Zealand, Economic Development Minister, Steven Joyce said the convention centre would add an estimated $90 million a year to the local economy, create 1,000 jobs during construction and 800 jobs once the centre is running.

In 2015 it was announced that the anticipated cost of the convention centre had increased by $70–$130 million, to a total maximum of $530 million. Prime Minister John Key said he was considering making up the shortfall by giving Skycity public tax money to finish the project – as it would be an &quot;eyesore&quot; if the extra funding was not made available. Two days later on 12 February, following criticism in the media and in Parliament, the Prime Minister described the use of taxpayer funds as the &quot;least preferred option&quot;. Subsequently, on 15 February, it was announced that instead of seeking funding from the government for project over-runs, Skycity would instead be allowed to build a convention centre which was slightly smaller, so that total costs would remain about $400 million. The other option was that Skycity could put in funds of its own to build a large convention centre. The Labour Party claimed the move was a win for those who were opposed to public money bailing out the deal.

=== 2019 convention centre fire ===

A fire in the roof and upper part of the new convention centre started on 22 October 2019 while the building was still under construction. The fire burned for about two days, partly as a result of a decision to sacrifice the roof in order to try to save the lower part of the building by improving safety and access for firefighters working under the roof. After the roof had mostly burned away the remaining fire was extinguished.

The fire caused widespread disruption to Auckland&#x27;s central business district and the air pollution in the city to exceed safe levels for the first time in over ten years.

<text>The Stormers (known for sponsorship reasons as the DHL Stormers) and the academic team DHL Stormers is a South African professional rugby union team based in Cape Town in the Western Cape that competes in the United Rugby Championship, a trans-hemispheric competition that also involves sides from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. They competed in the Super Rugby competition until 2020. They have won one major international championship, the 2021-22 United Rugby Championship, and seven South African &#x27;conference&#x27; titles, five in the South African Conference of Super Rugby, and two in the URC equivalent, the South African Shield.

==Background==
Stormers are centred on the Western Province Currie Cup side, but also draw players from the Boland Cavaliers (covering the Cape Winelands and West Coast districts, with home matches in Wellington). Through 2005, they also drew players from the SWD Eagles (George), which meant that they drew players from all three unions in the Western Cape Province. However, the general realignment of franchise areas resulting from the expansion of the competition resulted in the Eagles being moved to the area of the Southern Spears (later succeeded by the Southern Kings).

Before 1998, South Africa did not use a franchise system for the Super 12, instead sending the top four unions from its domestic competition, the Currie Cup, into the Super 12. In 1996, the Stormers qualified and competed in the Super 12 as Western Province. In 1997, they did not qualify, the 4th South African team being the Orange Free State (now the Free State Cheetahs at Currie Cup level; the region would later be represented in Super 12 by the Cats (now known as the Lions) and in Super 14 by the Cheetahs).

The Stormers played their first ever final, against the Bulls in front of 36,000 fans in Johannesburg, in 2010 after beating the Waratahs in the semi-final stage but ultimately lost to the Bulls. In the two previous years in which they reached the semi-finals, 1999 and 2004, they were eliminated by the Highlanders and Crusaders.

They made consecutive home semifinals in 2011 and 2012, but lost both at Newlands to the Crusaders and the Sharks respectively. In 2015 they won the South African conference for a third time, before losing their home quarterfinal against the Brumbies.

In 2021–22, the Stormers, with their other South African Super Rugby colleagues the Bulls, the Sharks and the Lions, left Super Rugby to join the newly renamed United Rugby Championship with teams from Ireland, Scotland, Italy and Wales. Their first season in the URC was a success, winning the South African shield as the top team in their national conference, followed by the overall URC title with a win against the Bulls in the 2022 final. On 2 June 2022 it was confirmed that the four South African URC franchises, and the former Pro 14 franchise, the Cheetahs would be entering the European Professional Club Rugby competitions for the first time in 2022–23, with the Stormers in the first tier European Rugby Champions Cup.

==History==
With the launch of the Super 12 in 1996, both Australia and New Zealand adopted franchise-based models for their provincial teams that were to compete in the new competition. However, the South Africa teams were to be determined by the results of the previous season&#x27;s Currie Cup, with the top four sides gaining entry in the Super 12. Newlands did see Super 12 competition during the era when this model of competition was used, with the Western Province gaining promotion for the inaugural season of 1996. However, the team did not perform that well, winning only three matches from 11 fixtures, and finishing second last on the table, though Transvaal and the Wellington Hurricanes both won the same number of games as the Western Province, they finished higher, due to a superior for and against.

The following season, in 1997, the Western Province did not gain promotion to the Super 12, and the Cape Town area was not represented that season, as the South Africa teams in competition were instead the , Gauteng Lions, Free State and Northern Transvaal. The next season, South Africa adopted a similar system to that of New Zealand&#x27;s and Australia&#x27;s, creating four new provincial sides, and abolishing qualification through the Currie Cup. One of the sides created was the Stormers, or the Western Stormers. The Stormers&#x27; first season was fairly similar to that of the Western Province&#x27;s in 1996, winning just the three games out of 11 fixtures, though they finished in ninth place overall on the table.

The 1999 Super 12 season was far more successful for the Stormers, as they lost only three matches during the regular season; against the ACT Brumbies, the Otago Highlanders and fellow South African team, the Cats, though the Stormers ended up finishing higher on the table than all of those sides, finishing in second place overall, behind the Queensland Reds. The Stormers thus qualified for the semi-finals for the first time and, due to their log position, hosted their semi-final in Cape Town. However, they were defeated by the Otago Highlanders, 33 points to 18.

In 2000, the Stormers fell just short of making the finals again, as they finished in fifth position, with a total of 31 points, just one point behind the Cats and Highlanders who both made it to the semi-finals, on 32 points. The following season - 2001 - saw the Stormers move further away from a place in the finals, as they won only five of their 11 fixtures and finished in seventh place on the log. The following season was not any better for the Stormers, despite starting the season with an optimistic 40 to 18 win over the Sharks, the Stormers ended up finishing in ninth place on the log.

The 2004 season saw the Stormers return to the success of 1999, as they qualified for the play-offs again. The team finished in third place overall, with seven wins, and on 34 points, one point more than the fourth placed Chiefs. The Stormers travelled to Jade Stadium in Christchurch, where they met the Crusaders in the semi-final. The home team won, defeating the Stormers 27 points to 16. The following season the Stormers fell to ninth place on the table come the end of the regular season, far from finals contention.

For the 2006 season, the Super 12 became the Super 14, with the addition of two new teams; one from Australia, the Western Force, and one from South Africa, the Cheetahs. The Stormers won four of the now 13 regular rounds, finishing in 11th place in the final standings.

The year 2008 was one of revival for the Stormers after Kobus van der Merwe was fired and ex-Cheetahs coach, Rassie Erasmus, was brought in as head coach and WP Director of Rugby. Rassie Erasmus was hoping for a top half of the table finish, however the Stormers exceeded expectations and after losing their first 3 games of the season fought back to finish tied for 4th place on the log, missing out on an away semi final due to an inferior points difference to the Hurricanes.

After a poor 2009, Allister Coetzee was appointed the coach and the Stormers reshuffled their squad, bringing in many new faces including Springbok stars Jacque Fourie and Bryan Habana, while losing a host of players such as Springbok centre Jean de Villiers (Munster), fullback Percy Montgomery (Retired) and controversial flank Luke Watson (Bath). The Stormers enjoyed a successful start to their 2010 campaign, winning 5 of their first 6 games. They then started their four match tour of the Antipodes and while they disappointingly lost to the then last-placed Western Force and a resurgent Queensland Reds, they defeated the Blues and Chiefs to be firmly in semi-final contention at the end of the tour. They returned home to South Africa and after cruising past the Crusaders, they lost to the Sharks. This meant that they had to win their last game against the Bulls to claim a home semi-final. The Bulls, already qualified in first position, fielded a weakened line-up and the Stormers duly beat them 38–10 for their first home semi-final since 1999. In the semi-final against the Waratahs a win was never in doubt as they beat the men from Sydney 25–6, the game&#x27;s only try being a spectacular individual effort by Juan de Jongh. With the Bulls winning the other semi against the Crusaders, an all South African final was ensured.

After a great semifinal performance, the Stormers went down in the final 25–17 to the Bulls at the historic Orlando Stadium. The Stormers started slowly with a try against the run of play from Francois Hougaard but time ran out as they took the ascendency.

In 2012, the Stormers topped the log for the first time, after being undefeated at home and winning almost all their South African conference games, the Stormers headed to the Semi Finals with a guaranteed home final if they won, however the Sharks managed to knock out the Cape side and left them wondering for a second straight year, this was to be revenged in October when Province gave the Sharks payback by winning the Currie Cup against them.

In 2013 the Stormers had a tough start to the season, and despite winning their last six matches it was not enough to secure a play-off spot as they ended the season in seventh place, the following year the Cape side ended in 11th place after winning nine and losing nine games, however in 2015 they managed to qualify for the play-off once more after winning the South African conference before going down to the Brumbies in a home play-off match at Newlands.

With the departure of Allister Coetzee at the end of the 2015 season, the Stormers appointed former Springbok centre Robbie Fleck as the new head coach in 2016.

With 2020 being the last season at Newlands rugby stadium, a new head coach in John Dobson and a forward pack loaded with world cup winning Springboks, the class of 2020 will fancy their chances of bringing back some long-awaited silverware as a farewell gift to the old faithful.

In December 2023, it was announced that 74% of the shares in WP Professional Rugby (Pty) Ltd had been acquired by the Red Disa consortium, consisting of the Cape Town-based investment holding company Fynbos Ekwiteit, Ardagh Glass Packaging and the investment company Marble Head Investments.

In March 2024, it was announced that the vacant position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) had been filled by Johan le Roux. At the same time, John Dobson has now taken on the role of Director of Rugby in addition to his duties as Head Coach of the Stormers.

==Strip==
The first (Western) Stormers jersey and logo in 1998 combined the colours of the three Unions who made up the regional franchise – WP, SWD and Boland. There were a myriad of colours in the jersey – blue, white, red, green, gold – and a triangular logo with a wave affect inside. Some liked the look, most did not. One newspaper scribe wrote: &quot;It looks like scrambled eggs with a box of Smarties thrown in!&quot;

In 1999 came a dramatic change from the &quot;loud&quot; look to a simple black jumper and shorts, with black and white &quot;Barbarian&quot; socks, bold numbering and the now familiar lightning bolt logo on the breast. The move to black was done with the express purpose of appealing to a much wider audience. Black became one of the core attributes of the Stormers brand.

2007, however, saw a move away from black to navy blue as the Stormers and WP brands converged.

In 2011, white bars across the front of the navy blue jersey was introduced in order to bring it further in line with the WP brand

In 2013 the colour was changed from blue to royal blue, the original colour of WP Rugby. When held to low light however, the jerseys show two different shades of blue.

From their inception until 2017, the Stormers&#x27; uniforms were made by international sportswear giants Adidas, who had likewise supplied Western Province&#x27;s playing strip since 1983. However, from 2018 onwards WPRFU officials announced that both the Stormers and Province would wear unbranded jerseys manufactured by local firm Genuine Connection, who had previously been contracted by Adidas to produce their team-issue playing kits since the year 2000.

==Stadium==


The first official matches played at Newlands were in 1890. The ground has been continually developed over the past century, entirely by the efforts of the Western Province Rugby Football Union and its administrators. The stadium has taken on various names over the years due to sponsorship of the Western Province side, but is today simply named Newlands, a decision made by former Stormers sponsors Investec. Vodacom has since taken over sponsorship of the team and stadium, but chose not to rename the stadium. Newlands has usually drawn the largest average crowds of any stadium in Super Rugby competition. In 2002 the Stormers welcomed their millionth spectator through the gates. The ground was bought in 1888, and currently has a capacity of 50,900.

There was speculation of a possible move from Newlands to the Cape Town Stadium, which was built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, the Stormers continued playing at Newlands and had one of the largest crowd attendances in Super Rugby, often attracting crowds in excess of 45,000 at home Super Rugby games.

From 2021 onwards, after 131 years at Newlands and rumours of them moving stadium, the Western Province Rugby Football Union decided to change the home ground of the Stormers to the DHL Stadium.

<doc id="710897" wikidata="Q740887" url="?curid=710897" title="Gardenia">
<text>Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Madagascar, Pacific Islands, and Australia.

The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Alexander Garden (1730–1791), a Scottish naturalist. The type species is &quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot;, as first published by Ellis in 1961.

==Description==

Gardenia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, however some species, such as those native to New Guinea, may grow to 20-30m tall. A small number of species found in tropical East Africa and southern Africa grow as small pyrophytic subshrubs. At least one species, &quot;Gardenia epiphytica&quot;, native to Gabon and Cameroon, grows as an epiphyte. Most species are unarmed and spineless, but some species such as some of those found in Africa are spinescent.

The leaf arrangement is typically opposite or verticillate may (arranged in whorls). Leaves vary by species; many species are glossy with a distinctly coriaceous (or leathery) texture such as that seen in &quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot;, whilst in others, leaves may be thin and chartaceous (or paper-like).

The flowers, particularly in the species most commonly grown in gardens, may be large and showy and white, cream or pale yellow in color, with a pleasant and strong, sometimes overpowering scent that may be more noticeable at night, something quite typical of moth-pollinated plants.

Gardenia flowers are hermaphrodite (or bisexual) with each individual flower having both as both male and female structures (that is, having both stamens and carpels) with the flower. The arrangement of the flowers on the plant are solitary or in small terminal clusters or fascicles. The flowers vary across species, but most commonly have a funnel- or cylindrical-shaped corolla tube, normally elongated and narrow distally, surrounded by 5-12 or more lobes (petals) contorted or arranged in an overlapping pattern.

==Phytochemistry==
Crocetin is a chemical compound usually obtained from &quot;Crocus sativus&quot;, which can also be obtained from the fruit of &quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot;. Gordonin is a novel methoxylated flavonol secreted in golden-colored resinous droplets of &quot;Gardenia gordonii&quot;, which is one of several critically endangered species of the Fiji Islands.

Many of the native gardenias of the Pacific Islands and elsewhere in the paleotropics contribute towards the production of a diverse array of natural products. Methoxylated and oxygenated flavonols, flavones, and triterpenes accumulate on the vegetative and floral buds as yellow to brown droplets of secreted resins. Many focused phytochemical studies of these bud exudates have been published, including a population-level study of two rare, sympatric species of Fiji, &quot;G. candida&quot; and &quot;G. grievei&quot;. The evolutionary significance of the gums and resins of gardenias in attracting or repelling invertebrate herbivores, has yet to be explored by ecologists.

==Cultivation and uses==
Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in size in some species.

&quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot; (syn. &quot;G. grandiflora&quot;, &quot;G. florida&quot;) is cultivated as a house plant. This species can be difficult to grow because it originated in warm humid tropical areas. It demands high humidity to thrive, and bright (but not direct) light. It flourishes in acidic soils with good drainage and thrives on temperatures of during the day and in the evening. Potting soils developed especially for gardenias are available. &quot;G. jasminoides&quot; grows no larger than 18 inches in height and width when grown indoors. In climates where it can be grown outdoors, it can attain a height of 6 feet. If water touches the flowers, they will turn brown.

In Eastern Asia, &quot;Gardenia jasminoides&quot; is called () in China, () in Korea, and () in Japan. Its fruit is used as a yellow dye, used on fabric and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called &quot;hwangpomuk&quot;). Its fruits are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their clearing, calming, and cooling properties.

In France, gardenias are the flower traditionally worn by men as boutonnière when in evening dress. In &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, Edith Wharton suggests it was customary for upper-class men from New York City to wear a gardenia in their buttonhole during the Gilded Age.,

Sigmund Freud remarked to the poet H.D. that gardenias were his favorite flower.

In tiki culture, Donn Beach, aka Don the Beachcomber, frequently wore a fresh lei of gardenias almost every day at his tiki bars, allegedly spending $7,800 for flowers over the course of four years in 1938. He named one of his drinks the mystery gardenia cocktail. Trader Vic frequently used the gardenia as a flower garnish in his tiki drinks, such as in the scorpion and outrigger tiara cocktails.

Several species occur in Hawaii, where gardenias are known as &quot;nau&quot; or &quot;nānū&quot;.

Hattie McDaniel famously wore gardenias in her hair when she accepted an Academy Award, the first for an African American, for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Mo&#x27;Nique Hicks later wore gardenias in her hair when she won her Oscar, as a tribute to McDaniel.

<text>James Roosevelt &quot;Tadd&quot; Roosevelt Jr. (August 20, 1879 – June 7, 1958), also called Taddy, was an American heir and member of the Roosevelt and Astor families.

==Early life==
James Roosevelt Roosevelt Jr. was born on August 20, 1879. He was the son of diplomat James Roosevelt &quot;Rosey&quot; Roosevelt (1854–1927) of the Roosevelt family and Helen Schermerhorn (née Astor) Roosevelt (1855–1893) of the Astor family. He had one sister, Helen Rebecca Roosevelt (1881–1962).

Among his large and prominent family were uncles Franklin Delano Roosevelt (who was three years younger than Tadd), who later became President of the United States, and Colonel John Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Astor IV, who died during the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Tadd&#x27;s paternal grandparents were businessman James Roosevelt I and Rebecca Brien (née Howland) Roosevelt, while his maternal grandparents were businessman William Backhouse Astor Jr. and socialite Caroline (née Schermerhorn) Astor, who was known as &quot;the&quot; &quot;Mrs. Astor&quot;.

He and Franklin both attended Groton School and Harvard University, with Tadd being ahead of Franklin. Their kinship led to Franklin often being mockingly referred to as &quot;Uncle Frank&quot; while the two attended Groton together.

==Career==
Upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1893, Tadd inherited $1,500,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars).

==Personal life==
On June 14, 1900, while still a student at Harvard, Roosevelt married 19-year-old Sadie Messinger (–1940) without the consent of his father Rosey. (In his biography on Franklin Roosevelt, Geoffrey C. Ward states that Messinger was &quot;at least 25 years-old.&quot;) Upon learning of the wedding, Rosey traveled from Hyde Park and brought Tadd home. A frequent sight at the Haymarket Dance Hall, Sadie was known by &quot;Dutch Sadie&quot; and &quot;Sadie of the Tenderloin.&quot; (Sadie is described in some accounts as a prostitute; Winston Groom described her as a &quot;hooker and sometime dancehall girl.&quot;) Rosey unsuccessfully attempted to have the marriage annulled, and both the Roosevelt and Astor families viewed the union as disgraceful. Rosey ultimately disowned Tadd; after the public scandal, which was reported in newspapers at the time, the father had a heart attack, which FDR blamed on Tadd&#x27;s marriage. In October 1900, FDR wrote to Sara Roosevelt, &quot;One can never again consider him a true Roosevelt. It would be well for him not only to parts unknown, but to stay there and begin life anew.&quot;

In 1907, Tadd was arrested for speeding on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. He lived in Florida for a time. In February 1917, Tadd was again arrested in Florida, and a local court in Volusia County reportedly ordered him to stay in Florida &quot;pending a settlement of a divorce suit.&quot; In 1911, he reportedly lived in Daytona under the name &quot;M. S. King&quot;; the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported in 1917 that the Roosevelt family had prevailed in achieving a separation, in which Sadie was to receive a $10,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) annual income. A court soon granted $625 (equivalent to $ in dollars) per month alimony to Sadie, pending settlement of the divorce. At the time, Tadd was reported to be the Floridian paying the highest income taxes, having a $12,000,000 fortune (equivalent to $ in dollars).

==Later years and death==
By October 1921, Tadd and Sadie were reportedly no longer living together. However, they remained married until her death in 1940. Biographer Jean Edward Smith writes that Tadd and Sadie remained together until her death. They had no children.

After returning to New York, Tadd Roosevelt supported himself as an auto repairman. He reportedly did not use his large inheritance and was estranged from his family, communicating only to tell the Astor family that his money should be given to the Salvation Army upon his death.

Roosevelt died in Manhattan on June 7, 1958. A recluse in his later years, his fortune was donated to the Salvation Army, which received some $5 million.

<text>Homes Not Jails is an American organization that is affiliated with the San Francisco Tenants Union. It describes itself as an all-volunteer organization committed to housing homeless people through direct action. The group was formed in 1992. Homes Not Jails does public actions as well as legislative advocacy and squatting (occupying empty buildings for free). Homes Not Jails groups do &quot;housing takeovers&quot;, acts of civil disobedience in which vacant buildings are publicly occupied, to demonstrate the availability of vacant property and to advocate that it be used for housing. The group has done many such occupations. Homes Not Jails has also done and assisted with hundreds of &quot;covert&quot; squats in which vacant buildings are broken into so that people in need of housing can move in.

==History==
Homes Not Jails began in 1992 in the wave of homeless activist groups that began nationwide following the economic recession of the 1980s. In addition to traditional homeless advocacy, Homes Not Jails has used squatting as a tactic since its first public takeover. The group began in fall of 1992 with the takeover of a building at 90 Golden Gate Avenue in the Tenderloin District. On Thanksgiving Day, shortly after this first occupation, the group held a rally and marched to another building at 250 Taylor Street, and publicly occupied it. There were originally about 30 members. Homes Not Jails has had extensive media coverage of its advocacy in support of affordable housing, its covert housing of people in vacant buildings, and its protection of buildings slated for demolition.

San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto introduced legislation in 2004 sponsored by Homes Not Jails that would allow the city to seize abandoned buildings and give them to nonprofit housing groups; these could employ homeless people to repair and live in them.

==Sweat equity==
Sweat equity is the cornerstone of the Homes Not Jails philosophy. It is formulated to address the problem that most affordable housing is unaffordable for people with no income or people on General Assistance, Supplemental Security Income, or Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

==Covert squatting==
Homes Not Jails relies on lists of addresses supplied by sympathizers and search teams. At least one search team a week has been organized since 1992. On any given search the teams open one to a half-dozen vacant buildings. From 1994 to 1999 over 250 search teams have opened between 700 and 800 buildings.

<text>My Girl 2 is a 1994 American comedy-drama film. A sequel to the 1991 film &quot;My Girl&quot;, it was directed by Howard Zieff from a screenplay written by Janet Kovalcik, and starring Dan Aykroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis, Anna Chlumsky and Austin O&#x27;Brien. Cast members Aykroyd, Curtis, Chlumsky and Richard Masur reprised their roles in the film which follows a now-teenaged Vada Sultenfuss, who travels from her home in suburban Pennsylvania to Los Angeles to find more information about her deceased mother.

A book based on the script was written by Patricia Hermes in 1994.

==Plot==

Vada Sultenfuss has matured from the 11-year-old hypochondriac in 1972 to a more serious teenager in early 1974. Her father Harry and his new wife Shelly DeVoto, whom he dated in the first film, are expecting a baby, and they all still live in the Sultenfuss funeral parlor in Madison, Pennsylvania. To accommodate the new baby, Vada moves into her late Gramoo&#x27;s old bedroom. She struggles with these adjustments, along with figuring boys out. One of them from school, Kevin, seems to like her friend Judy, but Vada wonders if he likes her, too. Both her father and Shelly try to give Vada some boy advice, but it backfires.

Vada receives a school assignment to write an essay on someone she admires but has never met. She decides to write about her late mother, Margaret Ann Muldovan (Maggie), but has few sources to go on, all confined to a small box. Among its contents are programs of plays her mother acted in, a passport, and a mystery paper bag with a date scribbled on it. Vada expresses her desire to travel someday, so Shelly concocts a plan for her to go to Los Angeles during her spring break, where she can stay with her uncle Phil and do research on her mother, who lived in L.A. growing up. Initially against the idea, believing Vada is too young to be traveling by herself, and fearing what might happen to her there, Harry lets Vada take the five-day trip.

On arriving in L.A., Vada confronts a boy her age named Nick, who shows up at the airport instead of Phil. He is the son of Phil&#x27;s girlfriend Rose, who runs a car repair shop where Phil is now a mechanic. Vada notices that her uncle has trouble with commitment, while he and Rose live together. Although annoyed at first about sacrificing his own spring break, Nick helps Vada with the difficult search of learning more about her mother taking her around the city.

First planning to visit her mother&#x27;s high school, Vada discovers that it was destroyed in a fire. Nevertheless, she and Nick eventually track down a yearbook and meet several people who knew Maggie, including a police officer, photographer and film director. Vada also meets her favorite poet, Alfred Beidermeyer, who also lives in L.A., but is dismayed when he advises her not to become a writer. Later in the trip, Nick and Vada sneak out to catch some Hollywood attractions, during which time Vada also gets her ears pierced, despite Nick&#x27;s opposition.

Vada learns some shocking things about her mother, such as being suspended from school for smoking, and having another husband before her father named Jeffrey Pommeroy. Emotionally crushed by the latter, Vada suspects that Jeffrey may actually be her father instead. Realizing he holds the key to more about her mother, she gets help from the police to locate him. Vada goes to see Jeffrey, who instantly remembers Maggie. He provides Vada with valuable information for her essay, including a home movie and the answer behind the date written on the paper bag. Viewing the home movie touches Vada, as she watches her mother. Jeffrey also assures Vada that he is not her father, explaining they divorced before Vada was born, because her mother wanted stability and a family, which her father, Harry, was able to provide.

Meanwhile, Phil tries to prove his love to Rose, after a man owning a fancy car repeatedly stops by the repair shop and tries to sweep her away by continuously flattering her. When Phil finally gets the courage to show how much she means to him, he proposes to her.

As Vada is ready to head home, she and Nick share a goodbye kiss at the airport before she boards the plane. He has left her a gift of earrings in her backpack. When she returns home, she finds out that Shelly just had the baby and heads to the hospital to see her new half-brother. To calm his crying, Vada holds him and sings &quot;Smile&quot;, a song she heard her mother singing in the home movie. Vada receives an A+ on her essay, and hopes to share what she learned during her trip with her brother someday.

==Release==
The film debuted at number 4 at the U.S. box office, earning approximately $5 million during its opening weekend. It went on to gross $17,359,799 domestically and $11 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $28 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;My Girl 2&quot; holds a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on fifteen reviews.

Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was critical of the film, writing that its &quot;dubious scenario is made even more so by the treacly approach of director Howard Zieff and screenwriter Janet Kovalcik. Everything in this film is sugared with sermons about the importance of Being Yourself. Vada doesn&#x27;t experience any twinges of rage at the loss of her mother or any misgivings about her quest. She&#x27;s preternaturally mature.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, commended it as &quot;appealingly sentimental,&quot; adding: &quot;Where the first movie forced Vada to face some jarring realities (a best friend&#x27;s death, a grandmother&#x27;s senility) and was heavily salted with mortuary humor, the atmosphere of the sequel is softer and more golden. Among other things, the film is a nostalgic valentine to Los Angeles in palmier days when the city still wore the mystique of a laid-back, post-hippie lotus land.&quot;

Roger Ebert awarded the film two out of four stars, noting that it &quot;seems inspired mostly by the opportunity to recycle the title of a successful film. Scrutinizing the popularity of the first film, perhaps the producers thought it depended on gentle sentimentality, in which a likable young girl deals with the loss of loved ones. As an idea for a series, this is fairly dangerous...  I think it&#x27;s time to give Vada a break, before she becomes a necrophile, and starts spending all of her time upstairs like Emily Dickinson, writing bleak little poems.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film a &quot;pleasant, painless and, as sequels go, genuinely ambitious,&quot; but conceded that it &quot;may not be enough...  to broaden its appeal beyond its obvious target audience of preteen and young adolescent girls (and, of course, tag-along parents and boyfriends).&quot;

===Home media===
Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on June 11, 1996. It was released for the first time on DVD in the United States on December 3, 2002.

==Awards==
For her performance, Chlumsky won a Young Artist Award for &quot;Best Performance by a Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture&quot;; Thomson and O&#x27;Brien were also nominated for Young Artist Awards for their roles.

==Cancelled sequel==
For several years &quot;Still My Girl&quot; (aka &quot;My Girl 3&quot;) was proposed as the third motion picture in the &quot;My Girl&quot; movie franchise and it was in development at Columbia Pictures. In his 2003 United Kingdom talk show interview with host Michael Parkinson, Dan Aykroyd stated that Columbia had an interest in &quot;getting this off the ground&quot; and strong interest in Anna Chlumsky returning to her role as Vada. In 2009, both Chlumsky and Aykroyd were still attached to the project but as the time passed it was becoming less and less likely that it would ever go into production. In April 2012, Chlumsky &quot;put to rest&quot; any rumors that such a film was in development.

<text>The Japanese archipelago (Japanese: , &quot;Nihon Rettō&quot;) is an archipelago of 14,125 islands that form the country of Japan. It extends over from the Sea of Okhotsk in the northeast to the East China and Philippine seas in the southwest along the Pacific coast of the Eurasian continent, and consists of three island arcs from north to south: the Northeastern Japan Arc, the Southwestern Japan Arc, and the Ryukyu Island Arc. The Daitō Islands, the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc, the Kuril Islands, and the Nanpō Islands neighbor the archipelago.

Japan is the largest island country in East Asia and the fourth-largest island country in the world with . It has an exclusive economic zone of .

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Mainland Japan&quot; is used to distinguish the large islands of the Japanese archipelago from the remote, smaller islands; it refers to the main islands of Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. From 1943 until the end of the Pacific War, Karafuto Prefecture (south Sakhalin) was designated part of the mainland. Geographically speaking the term &quot;mainland&quot; is somewhat inaccurate, as this refers to an expanse of territory that is attached to a continental landmass.

The term &quot;home islands&quot; was used at the end of World War II to define the area where Japanese sovereignty and constitutional rule of its emperor would be restricted. The term is also commonly used today to distinguish the archipelago from Japan&#x27;s colonies and other territories.

== Palaeogeography ==

==Geography==

The archipelago consists of 14,125 islands (here defined as land more than 100 m in circumference), of which 430 are inhabited. The five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Honshu is the largest and referred to as the Japanese mainland.

The topography is divided as:
*Hokkaido, Honshu, and Shikoku and its surrounding islands;
*Kyushu and the Ryukyu arc, which is composed of the Ryukyu Islands and other surrounding islands;
*Eastern part of Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands;
*Nanpō Islands and the Izu Peninsula (part of Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc).

<text>In most Unix and Unix-like operating systems, the codice_1 (&quot;process status&quot;) program displays the currently-running processes. The related Unix utility codice_2 provides a real-time view of the running processes.

==Implementations==
KolibriOS includes an implementation of the command. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. In Windows PowerShell, codice_1 is a predefined command alias for the codice_4 cmdlet, which essentially serves the same purpose.

==Examples==

# ps
 PID TTY TIME CMD
 7431 pts/0 00:00:00 su
 7434 pts/0 00:00:00 bash
18585 pts/0 00:00:00 ps
Users can pipeline codice_1 with other commands, such as less to view the process status output one page at a time:
$ ps -A | less
Users can also utilize the codice_1 command in conjunction with the codice_7 command (see the codice_8 and codice_9 commands) to find information about a single process, such as its id:
$ # Trying to find the PID of `firefox-bin` which is 2701
$ ps -A | grep firefox-bin
2701 ? 22:16:04 firefox-bin
The use of codice_8 simplifies the syntax and avoids potential race conditions:

$ pgrep -l firefox-bin
2701 firefox-bin
To see every process running as root in user format:

# ps -U root -u
USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TT STAT STARTED TIME COMMAND
root 1 0.0 0.0 9436 128 - ILs Sun00AM 0:00.12 /sbin/init --
==Header line==

* = Often abbreviated

==Options==
codice_1 has many options. On operating systems that support the SUS and POSIX standards, codice_1 commonly runs with the options -ef, where &quot;-e&quot; selects every process and &quot;-f&quot; chooses the &quot;full&quot; output format. Another common option on these systems is -l, which specifies the &quot;long&quot; output format.

Most systems derived from BSD fail to accept the SUS and POSIX standard options because of historical conflicts. (For example, the &quot;e&quot; or &quot;-e&quot; option will display environment variables.) On such systems, codice_1 commonly runs with the non-standard options aux, where &quot;a&quot; lists all processes on a terminal, including those of other users, &quot;x&quot; lists all processes without controlling terminals and &quot;u&quot; adds a column for the controlling user for each process. For maximum compatibility, there is no &quot;-&quot; in front of the &quot;aux&quot;. &quot;ps auxww&quot; provides complete information about the process, including all parameters.

<text>California Men&#x27;s Colony (CMC) is an American male-only state prison located northwest of the city of San Luis Obispo in San Luis Obispo County, California, along the central California coast approximately halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

==Facilities==
CMC has two separate facilities on its : East and West. The minimum-security West facility includes Level I (&quot;without a secure perimeter&quot;) housing and Level II (&quot;with secure perimeter fences and armed coverage&quot;) open dormitories. The medium-security east facility has level III with individual cells, fenced perimeters and armed coverage, with housing divided into four quadrangles, as well as a licensed hospital and mental health delivery system.

As of Fiscal Year 2006/2007, CMC had a total of 1,870 staff and an annual operating budget of $151 million.

As of January 31, 2023, CMC had an inmate population of 3,254, or 85.3% of its design capacity.

==Programs==
CMC has been called a &quot;country club&quot; and &quot;garden spot&quot; among California prisons because of its wide variety of vocational, educational and psychological-treatment programs. Notable CMC programs include:

* Arts in Corrections, &quot;designed to rehabilitate inmates through art.&quot; 
* A &quot;Level I camp program for fire suppression, conservation and other community service work.&quot; The jobs include &quot;trash pickup and removal&quot; at Port San Luis Harbor District properties, including Avila Beach.
* Central Coast Adult School, which &quot;aims to reduce the recidivism rate and help inmates rejoin the work force.&quot;
* Prison Industry Authority, which &quot;manufactures and ships millions of dollars of prison-made products annually.&quot;
* Prisoners Against Child Abuse, which &quot;donates more than $100,000 a year to local children&#x27;s organizations.&quot;
* Narcotics Anonymous.
* Alcoholics Anonymous.

==History==
The West Facility opened in 1954 and the East Facility opened in 1961. Three female former CMC workers won a 1998 settlement for $4.3 million as a result of a sexual harassment lawsuit, which was &quot;the largest such settlement ever for the Department of Corrections.&quot; A San Luis Obispo County grand jury produced a 2005 report observing that &quot;while old and overcrowded, CMC was well maintained.&quot; The West facility is slated for closure.

==Notable inmates==
* Bobby Beausoleil, convicted murderer associated with the Manson Family (though convicted of a crime pre-dating the Tate/LaBianca murders), was incarcerated at CMC during the 1990s. His wife, Barbara, lived nearby for years.
* Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris met at CMC in 1978, before they committed their crime spree.
* In 1996, Christian Brando was released from CMC &quot;after serving five years of a 10-year term in the fatal shooting of his half sister&#x27;s boyfriend.&quot;
* Bruce McGregor Davis, convicted Manson Family murderer serving two life sentences for his parts in two Manson Family murders. 
* Richard Allen Davis was paroled from CMC in June 1993 &quot;after serving half of a 16-year sentence&quot; for kidnapping.
*Rapper Tracy Lamar Davis (a.k.a. Big Tray Deee) was convicted for attempted murder in 2005 for firing at rival gang members. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison but was released after nine years on April 3, 2014.
* Jim Gordon, the drummer, spent some time at CMC after killing his mother in 1983.
* Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson was in CMC between 1984 and October 1986 &quot;for sexually assaulting two teenage girls and then trying to bribe them not to testify against him.&quot;
* Larry Hurwitz. The &quot;Starry Night&quot; murderer.
* Maulana Karenga was incarcerated in 1971 after being convicted of felony violence against a woman victim who testified he tortured her. 
* Charles Keating Jr. began his stay at CMC in 1992, but his state and federal convictions were overturned, so he was released in October 1996.
* Suge Knight was incarcerated at CMC beginning in February 1997 but was later transferred to Mule Creek State Prison.
* Timothy Leary was imprisoned at CMC after being sentenced in March 1970 for possession of marijuana, but escaped from the West facility in September 1970 with the assistance of the Weatherman organization. He had been placed in &quot;the least security-rated institution in the state&quot; because &quot;he did not &#x27;represent either violence potential or serious escape risk&#x27;.&quot; After spending time with Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria and attempting to &quot;gain political asylum&quot; in Switzerland, Leary was arrested in Afghanistan in January 1973. After being convicted of &quot;escape from a minimum security prison,&quot; he was sent to California Medical Facility.
* Danny Masterson, an actor best known for his work on the sitcom &quot;That 70’s Show &quot; (1998–2006), is currently incarcerated at CMC as of February 2024 after being convicted of rape. Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, which means he might be eligible for parole after serving 25½ years. His lawyers have said they will appeal the conviction.
* Demetrius &quot;Hook&quot; Mitchell was at CMC between 2000 and 2004. Much of the film documentary &quot;&quot; was filmed while Hook was at CMC.
* Herbert Mullin &quot;spent nearly 20 years&quot; at CMC &quot;before being transferred to Mule Creek in 1993.&quot;
*Prominent Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton was at CMC between 1968 and 1970. He was confined to his cell because he refused to work.
* Craig Peyer, former CHP officer convicted of murdering Cara Knott while on duty. His next parole hearing will be in 2027.
* Mark Rogowski, former professional skateboarder pleaded guilty on March 20, 1991 to the murder (first-degree) and rape of Jessica Bergsten. 
* Lawrence Singleton in 1987 &quot;earned an early release [from CMC] through a work program and good behavior&quot; after having served 8 years of a 14-year sentence.
* Edgar Smith, now at High Desert State Prison (California), had a parole hearing in March 2007.
* Ike Turner served 18 months of a four-year sentence at CMC between March 1990 and September 1991 for cocaine possession offenses.
* Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson was at CMC between the early 1970s and 1993, where he &quot;married and fathered three children during conjugal visits&quot; and &quot;began operating a nonprofit Christian ministry that distributed audio tapes and solicited donations.&quot; He was then transferred to the medium-security Mule Creek State Prison. A spokesman for the prison stated that the move was &quot;part of the routine shuffling of inmates around the state&quot;; however, others said that it was related to pressure from the family of Sharon Tate, recommendations of the state Board of Prison Terms, and the actions of a state senator.
* Jean-Pierre Michael Wehry was arrested in the 2006 Riverside, California &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; sting. He received the longest sentence in &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; history (75 years to life) due to California&#x27;s three-strikes law and remains incarcerated. He released an autobiography titled &quot;In For Life: Confessions of a Three-Strikes Prisoner&quot; under the pen name Damien Lartigue.
* Richard Allen Minsky, convicted serial rapist.
* John Timothy Earnest, perpetrator of the Poway synagogue shooting where he murdered one and injured three.

<text>AK Press is a worker-managed, independent publisher and book distributor that specializes in publishing books about anarchism and the radical left. Operated out of Chico, California, United States, with a branch in Edinburgh, Scotland, the company is collectively owned.

==History==
AK was founded in Stirling, Scotland, by Ramsey Kanaan in 1987 as a small mail-order distribution outlet, eventually expanding into independent publishing and moving the Scotland base of operations to Edinburgh, Scotland, and later opening a US base of operations in Oakland, California. The press was named for Kanaan&#x27;s mother, Ann Kanaan. Kanaan and several other members of AK Press left in 2007 to form PM Press. 

After operating out of the Bay Area for decades, in March 2015, a deadly fire at a warehouse complex in West Oakland, California, damaged AK Press&#x27;s warehouse and prompted the press to relocate to their present base in Chico.

In 2020, AK Press joined as a founding member of the Radical Publishers&#x27; Alliance, a group of politically oriented book publishers and magazines around the world.

== Operations ==
AK Press is organized as a collective, akin to a workers&#x27; co-operative. The press is owned by all members of the collective, works without bosses or hierarchy, and uses collective decision-making processes, following anarchist principles. 

Works published by AK Press include classic anarchist texts by Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Errico Malatesta, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and Voltairine de Cleyre, as well books on the history of anarchism and of anarchist struggles like the Spanish Revolution and the Makhnovshchina. They also publish on topics related to ongoing anti-fascism and contemporary anarchism, such as prison abolition, the environmental movement, anti-capitalism, feminism, and anti-racism. Noted authors include Noam Chomsky, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, and Harsha Walia.

AK Press regularly publishes in collaboration with the Institute for Anarchist Studies, the Kate Sharpley Library, and World War 3 Illustrated. They also publish the Emergent Strategy Series, edited by adrienne maree brown and inspired by her book of the same name, including books by queer Black feminists Alexis Pauline Gumbs and Alexis de Veaux. Their Black Dawn series is noted for releasing speculative fiction with anarchist and political themes, including books by Margaret Killjoy and adrienne maree brown, among others.

In both the US and UK, the business tables at anarchist bookfairs, conferences, activist gatherings, and literary festivals. The company also sells clothing, buttons, stickers, and various other related items.

<text>St. Clair Avenue is a major east-west street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was laid out in the late 18th century by the British as a concession road (the Third Concession), north of Bloor Street and north of Queen Street.

St. Clair Avenue has two sections. The western section extends from Moore Park in the east to Scarlett Road in the west, a distance of approximately . An eastern section picks up on the far side of the Don Valley at Taylor Creek Park, extending for to Kingston Road. Like all streets in Toronto which cross Yonge Street, St. Clair is divided into separate East and West sections, each with its own street numbers beginning at Yonge Street. Unlike most other concession-road streets in Toronto, St. Clair does not extend west into Etobicoke, due to the northern arc of Dundas Street crossing the Humber River near its western terminus, forming a link to Burnhamthorpe Road, its approximate equivalent arterial.

St. Clair Avenue West has heavy automotive and public transit traffic. Over half the commuters in rush hour traffic travel by the 512 St. Clair streetcar line which connects with St. Clair subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University and St. Clair West station also on the Line 1 Yonge-University subway. The eastern section of St. Clair Avenue East is serviced by the 8 Broadview and 102 Markham Road bus routes.

== Name ==
St. Clair Avenue takes its name from Augustine St. Clare, a character from the novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The Grainger family, who rented a farm near the present-day intersection of Avenue Road and St. Clair, had viewed a stage production of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; Two members of the family, Albert and Edwin, adopted names of two characters as their middle names as each boy had no given middle name. Edwin added Norton to his name, and Albert chose St. Clare, although he used the incorrect spelling of St. Clair, as it was used in the theatre program. (Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River use the same spelling, though they are named for the actual Saint Clare of Assisi, on whose feast day they were encountered by Sieur de La Salle.) As a joke, Edwin and Albert made street signs using their names and posted them at Yonge and St. Clair. The St. Clair sign survived for a while and the name became adopted as the name for the 3rd Concession Road. The first known printed use of the St. Clair name was in an 1878 publication, &quot;Illustrated Historical Atlas of the County of York&quot;.

In 1913, a Roman Catholic church was built in the Earlscourt District, and named after the actual Saint Clare. St. Clare&#x27;s Church is at 1118 St. Clair Avenue West, on the north side of the street, east of Dufferin. The parish opened the St. Clare&#x27;s Catholic School, an elementary school, next door in 1910.

== History ==
The first settlement on St. Clair was at Yonge Street, where the Heath family bought land in 1837. A thriving neighbourhood, Deer Park, was established by the 1850s. The next settlement was about west, at Old Weston Road (then Weston Road), where settlement of Carlton Village began in the late 1840s. The western end of St. Clair experienced substantial development, with the municipalities of West Toronto, Earlscourt, Dovercourt, and Oakwood established there.

These municipalities were annexed by Toronto between 1908 and 1911, and the western section of St. Clair Avenue became entirely managed by the City of Toronto. To stimulate development along what was then largely a rural road, the city&#x27;s Toronto Civic Railways built a streetcar line from Yonge Street to Caledonia Road by 1912. This included the construction of a bridge across Nordheimer Ravine (after an earth berm collapsed) as well as what was termed the &quot;Lauder Fill&quot;: the burying of the western branch of Garrison Creek, the final section to be routed into the city&#x27;s stormwater system.

The growth of the inner suburbs of Leaside, Rosedale and Moore Park prompted the city of Toronto to approach the operators of Mount Pleasant Cemetery in 1912 with the goal of extending the short Mount Pleasant Road south through the cemetery to connect with St. Clair. Though the operators initially refused, they later accepted the city&#x27;s offer of $100,000 ($2,095,000, adjusted for inflation) in 1915. The muddy road was opened to traffic in 1918. The construction of the Vale of Avoca through the first half of the 1920s prompted the new Toronto Transit Commission to extend the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road and then north to Eglinton Avenue.

From 1937 to 1952, St. Clair West formed part of provincial Highway 5A, providing an alternate route between Islington and Yonge Street that avoided the congestion of Bloor Street. By 1952, St. Clair was developed enough that it no longer served a provincial role; a new Toronto Bypass road under construction between Weston and Highway 11 would instead serve to divert highway traffic off local surface streets.

Much of the development from this era survives. St. Clair West is one of many streets in Toronto which has experienced little development since an initial building boom. The exception is the intersection with Yonge Street, which has experienced heavy nodal development since the opening of the St. Clair subway station there in 1954. The buildings there include the world headquarters of George Weston Foods Inc. St. Clair now intersects with two more subway stations, Warden Station in the east and St. Clair West Station near Bathurst Street, as well as Scarborough GO Station.

=== Streetcar Right-of-Way Project ===
The Toronto Transit Commission decided to upgrade the St. Clair streetcar to a dedicated right-of-way to increase service reliability when the streetcar tracks were approaching the end of their lifespan in the early 2000s. In October 2006, construction started on the right-of-way in the centre of St. Clair. St. Clair Avenue was one of the few streets in Toronto wide enough to accommodate a dedicated right-of-way without significantly reducing the width of traffic lanes.

The project was important for St. Clair West not only for the transit upgrades, but because it involved a near-total reconstruction of the street. Water mains were replaced. Overhead wires along the side of street and large wooden poles holding them up were phased out in favour of buried utilities, leaving only the single electric wires for streetcars. Unique poles and white streetlights were installed, coordinated in design with the new designer transit shelters. Trees were added, as well as ornamental pedestrian lighting along certain stretches, with the most extravagant in terms of design being in Corso Italia. The thorough redesign and reconstruction of the street was extended even to the streetcar loops. The streetcar right-of-way project upgraded the aesthetics of the public realm dramatically, though sidewalks had to be narrowed in places to accommodate the right-of-way and two lanes of traffic in each direction. The traffic lanes themselves were narrowed slightly.

==Neighbourhoods==

From east to west, the main section of St. Clair passes through several prominent neighbourhoods starting with Moore Park and Deer Park. West of Avenue Road are Forest Hill, the South Hill, Hillcrest, Wychwood, Oakwood, Earlscourt (including Corso Italia), and The Junction. The eastern section of St. Clair passes eastward starting in Parkview Hills, through Woodbine Gardens, Clairlea, Birchmount Park, and Kennedy Park to Cliffcrest.

St. Clair Avenue is well known for the high population of Portuguese, Latin American and Italian people. St. Clair is usually where the Italian and Portuguese soccer fans celebrate after a game their nations won. Over the years, the Italian and Portuguese people throughout Toronto have established a rivalry in soccer against each other. One of the largest celebrations on St. Clair Avenue was when Italy won the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which involved an estimated 300,000 fans, shutting the street down for nearly 20 blocks between Caledonia and Oakwood.

Corso Italia, Toronto&#x27;s other Italian enclave, is found on St. Clair Avenue West, between Westmount Avenue (just east of Dufferin Street) and Lansdowne Avenue. St. Clair West is also used as an umbrella term to refer to all neighbourhoods from Old Weston Road to Bathurst as they share a similar building style. Although the area has been historically referenced as predominantly Italian, it is no longer populated by any one majority. Many new homebuyers looking to purchase in the City are choosing St. Clair West for its relatively modest home prices, the pride of ownership apparent throughout its neighbourhoods, and the new St. Clair Ave. TTC streetcar right-of-way.

St. Clair Avenue holds Toronto&#x27;s biggest celebration of salsa Latino culture. The two-day street festival attracts an estimate of 250,000–500,000 people, the majority of them being from Latinos living in Toronto and all over Ontario come together to dance, eat, shop and celebrate the culture of Latin America. The festival is always held in July on the week, which it has been traditionally recognized as Latino Week in Toronto, in honour of the festival.

<doc id="710970" wikidata="Q1942010" url="?curid=710970" title="Modern primitive">
<text>Modern primitives or urban primitives are adherents of an alternative subculture in developed, Western countries who engage in body modification rituals and practices inspired by the ceremonies, rites of passage, or bodily ornamentation in what they consider &quot;traditional&quot;, non-Western cultures. These practices may include body piercing, tattooing, play piercing, flesh hook suspension, corset training, scarification, branding, and cutting.

== Origins ==
Roland Loomis, also known by his chosen name, Fakir Musafar, was one of the founders of the modern primitive movement. The 1989 RE/Search book &quot;Modern Primitives&quot; is considered as one of the first studies on of the concept of modern primitivism.

Modern primitives identify with a connection between what they see as &quot;the primitive&quot; and authenticity; &quot;in opposition to the corruptions of mainstream society&quot;.

Modern primitives may have a loose set of beliefs about their way of life, including
* Modification of the body in order to sculpt their self-image.
* Activities which reject society at large. Exploring the self is a personal statement, which society rejects.
* Resisting what they see as colonialism, and identification with anti-colonial struggles.

== Criticisms ==
Urban primitivism has been suggested as cultural appropriation and misrepresenting or &quot;bundling&quot; cultures together in a &quot;primitive&quot; setting. These have been debated, with adherents believing that these criticisms are based largely on the views of Roland Loomis rather than the culture as a whole.

<doc id="710974" wikidata="Q6269460" url="?curid=710974" title="Joint Terrorism Task Force">
<text>A Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) is an American locally-based multi-agency partnership between various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies tasked with investigating terrorism and terrorism-related crimes, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Department of Justice. The first JTTFs were established before the September 11 attacks, with their numbers increasing dramatically in the years after.

==History and organization==

The first JTTF was established in 1980 in New York City, with ten FBI special agents and ten New York City Police Department (NYPD) detectives. In 1999, the United States had 26 JTTFs; shortly after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller instructed all FBI field offices to establish formal terrorism task forces. By December 2011, there were more than 100 Joint Terrorism Task Forces nationwide, the vast majority established after the September 11 attacks. There were 113 JTTFs as of 2013, and approximately 200 JTTFs as of 2022.

JTTFs are led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice. The various investigators, analysts, and specialists who participate in JTTFs (including linguists and SWAT personnel) are drawn from more than 600 state and local agencies and 50 federal agencies (including both federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies). The FBI&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide&quot;, cited in a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, stated that more than 4,400 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and agents work in JTTFs.

The regional JTTFs coordinate their efforts through the interagency National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF), based at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. As of 2003, NJTTF was composed of representatives from 35 federal agencies and fell under the Operational Support Branch of the FBI Counterterrorism Division.

A 2013 report from the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law noted that &quot;JTTFs tend to focus on investigative work while fusion centers are geared towards information collection and analysis, but their missions are intimately related and often overlapping&quot;; JTTFs and fusion centers are sometimes &quot;co-located&quot; in the same physical working space.

== Investigations ==

Joint Terrorism Task Forces have participated in high-profile investigations, including investigations into the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, 2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot, 2009 plot by Najibullah Zazi targeting the New York City subway, Tarek Mehanna case, 2012 Jose Pimentel case, 2015 Usaama Rahim plot, Ahmad Khan Rahami&#x27;s 2016 New York and New Jersey bombings, Mark Steven Domingo&#x27;s failed 2019 plot to bomb a rally in Long Beach, California, and January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Before U.S. Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan murdered 14 people in a mass shooting at Fort Hood, the JTTF in San Diego had acquired two messages from Hasen to radical Islamic ideologue Anwar al-Aulaqi. Concerned by the content of the messages, the San Diego JTTF contacted FBI Headquarters and the JTTF based in the FBI&#x27;s Washington Field Office. The Washington Field Office did a limited assessment and concluded that Hasan was not &quot;involved in terrorist activities.&quot; In the meantime, agents in San Diego acquired 14 additional emails and messages (12 from Hasan to al-Aulaqi and two from al-Aulaqi to Hasen), but San Diego did not forward these communications to the D.C. JTTF, and neither JTTF took any action. Hasan committed the terrorist attack at Fort Hood several months later. A commission led by William H. Webster investigated the FBI&#x27;s counterterrorism intelligence in the lead-up to the Fort Hood shooting, and released its final report in 2012. The Webster Commission found that the assessment of Hasan conducted by the FBI and JTTFs was &quot;belated, incomplete, and rushed, primarily because of their workload&quot; and an &quot;exponential growth in the amount of electronically stored information.&quot; The report did, however, conclude that all the FBI and task force personnel &quot;acted with good intent&quot; and that their mistakes did not result &quot;from intentional misconduct.&quot;

==Local participation and withdrawals==

In 2005, Portland, Oregon became the first city in the nation to withdraw from a JTTF after the City Council voted 4–1 to leave. The city rejoined the task force in 2015, with the City Council voting 3–2 to approve the assignment of two of its city&#x27;s police officers to join the JTTF staff. In 2019, Portland again voted to leave the JTTF by a 3–2 vote.

After joining in 2002, San Francisco, California withdrew its police officers from the JTTF in 2017. It was later revealed in 2019 from an FBI white paper that San Francisco police officers and the FBI were not truthful about the JTTF&#x27;s violations of local law and policy, and that the police involved with JTTF thought civil rights and free speech in San Francisco were a problem.

==Criticism==
After the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the FBI began to establish or intensify working relationships with campus police departments; by January 2003, JTTFs included campus police officers from at least a dozen universities. This prompted some criticism from faculty and student organizations.

Documents obtained by various American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) affiliates in 2004, 2005, and 2006 in response to Freedom of Information Act requests showed that JTTF investigations have focused on &quot;peaceful advocacy organizations such as the School of the Americas Watch, Greenpeace, Catholic Workers Group, the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center in Colorado, and the Thomas Merton Center for Peace and Justice in Pennsylvania, among others.&quot; The ACLU has criticized these investigations, calling them &quot;inappropriate&quot; targeting of &quot;peaceful political activity having nothing to do with terrorism.&quot;

After a detective with the Fresno County, California Sheriff&#x27;s Department who was a member of the JTTF attended public meetings of Peace Fresno in 2003, the Sheriff&#x27;s Department issued a statement saying that &quot;For the purpose of detecting or preventing terrorist activities, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department may visit any place and attend any event that is open to the public, on the same terms and conditions as members of the public generally.&quot;

In June 2008, according to &quot;City Pages&quot;, the Minneapolis-based JTTF approached a source to infiltrate vegan potlucks and eventually report back to authorities on organized protesting activities in preparation for the 2008 Republican National Convention in nearby Saint Paul.

In 2010, the Justice Department Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report that criticized the FBI for investigating various domestic activist groups from 2001 to 2006, including PETA, the Thomas Merton Center, and the Catholic Worker. The OIG faulted the FBI for providing the OIG &quot;with speculative, after-the-fact rationalizations for their prior decisions to open investigations that [OIG] did not find persuasive.&quot;

A 2013 report from the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law argued that, &quot;The most significant oversight problem with assigning police officers to JTTFs is that there is no mechanism geared towards ensuring compliance with state and local laws. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that rules relating to how police officers should act in the event of a conflict between their federal and state/local obligations are sometimes unknown and almost always unclear.&quot;

<text>The Hungarian Research Centre for Linguistics () was created in 1949. It was under the supervision of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 1951 until 2019, when it was moved by a governmental decree to the supervision of Eötvös Loránd Research Network, a decision contested by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Its primary tasks include research in Hungarian linguistics, general, theoretical and applied linguistics, Uralic linguistics, and phonetics, as well as the preparation of a comprehensive dictionary of the Hungarian language, and the maintenance of its archive materials. Other research projects investigate various aspects and different variants of Hungarian. Further tasks include the assembly of linguistic corpora and databases, and laying the linguistic groundwork for computational software and applications. The Institute also operates a public advice service on language and linguistics, prepares expert reports on relevant affairs on demand, and runs the Theoretical Linguistics Undergraduate and Doctoral Program jointly with Eötvös Loránd University.

<text>Bradley Ray Richards (born May 2, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. Richards was drafted in the third round, 64th overall, by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and played for the Lightning, New York Rangers, Dallas Stars, Chicago Blackhawks, and Detroit Red Wings during his National Hockey League (NHL) career.

Richards is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, having won in 2004 with the Lightning, where he was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player during the playoffs. He also won in 2015 as a member of the Blackhawks.

==Early career==
Richards was born and raised in Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island. Since age 14, Richards has been friends with Vincent Lecavalier after they met at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, a boarding school with a renowned hockey program in Wilcox, Saskatchewan. They were roommates and soon became good friends as they were both the youngest players on their hockey team. Since then, they went on to become teammates for the Rimouski Océanic of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) and the Tampa Bay Lightning. Lecavalier was also responsible for suggesting to Lightning management after they had drafted him to draft Richards.

In his final season with Rimouski, Richards won nearly every honour possible for a Canadian junior player in the QMJHL: he earned the Jean Béliveau Trophy after leading the QMJHL with 186 points, as well as the Telus Cup, given to the league&#x27;s best offensive player; he won the QMJHL and Canadian Hockey League Plus/Minus Awards with a plus-80 mark, and was a First-Team All-Star in both the Quebec circuit and the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), as well as the CHL Player of the Year and Leading Scorer. In the post-season, Richards took home both the Guy Lafleur Trophy as MVP of the QMJHL playoffs, then the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as MVP of the 2000 Memorial Cup, as the Océanic won both the QMJHL playoff title and the CHL Memorial Cup.

==Playing career (2000–2016)==

===Tampa Bay Lightning (2000–2008)===

Richards was drafted in the third round, 64th overall, by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, having recorded 82 assists and 115 points in his draft year. During that same draft, the Lightning selected Vincent Lecavalier, Richards&#x27; teammate at both the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame and Rimouski, with the first overall pick. During the 2003–04 NHL season, the Lightning would win their first Stanley Cup, with Richards&#x27; contributions during the playoffs earning him the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the postseason, which included a record seven game-winning goals, overtaking Joe Sakic&#x27;s and Joe Nieuwendyk&#x27;s record of six. He also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season. Later that year, he won the World Cup of Hockey Championship playing on Team Canada.

On September 26, 2004, the Rimouski Océanic of the QMJHL retired Richards&#x27; jersey.

Richards played for Ak Bars Kazan in the Russian Superleague (RSL) during the 2004–05 NHL lockout on a team with fellow NHLers Ilya Kovalchuk, Alexei Kovalev, Vincent Lecavalier, Michael Nylander, Alexei Zhitnik, Dany Heatley and Nikolai Khabibulin. Richards also played for Team Canada at the 2006 Olympics.

After the Lightning were eliminated from the 2006 playoffs, the Lightning re-signed Richards to a five-year, US$39 million contract extension.

===Dallas Stars (2008–2011)===
On February 26, 2008, roughly three hours before the NHL trade deadline, Richards was traded to the Dallas Stars in a blockbuster deal (along with goaltender Johan Holmqvist) in exchange for goaltender Mike Smith, centre Jeff Halpern, winger Jussi Jokinen and a 2009 fourth-round draft pick. Richards set the Stars&#x27; franchise record of most assists in a player&#x27;s team debut game with five; the record is also a career high for Richards. In the game, Dallas defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 7–4, and Richards was named the game&#x27;s first star.

In the 2008 playoffs, Richards tied an NHL record by scoring four points in a single period in a game against the San Jose Sharks.

During the 2008–09 season, Richards tallied 16 goals and 48 points in 55 games before sustaining a broken wrist following a check from Columbus Blue Jackets forward Jakub Voráček on February 16, 2009. Richards met with a specialist the following day and missed 15 games. Richards returned to the Stars&#x27; line-up on March 21, but he then broke his other hand in the third period of Dallas&#x27; loss to San Jose. He would not return for the rest of the season, and the Stars missed the playoffs.

In the 2009 off-season, the team removed general managers Brett Hull and Les Jackson, who had traded for Richards, and fired head coach Dave Tippett, replacing the latter with Marc Crawford. Despite the new regime and the team&#x27;s woeful finish in the standings for the second-straight season, Richards enjoyed a career year, matching a personal high with 91 points scored, playing mainly alongside Loui Eriksson and roommate James Neal. Richards finished seventh in the NHL points standings that year, just behind former Lightning teammate Martin St. Louis. He also finished fourth in the NHL in total assists and second in powerplay points. However, the Stars failed to reach 2010 playoffs. After the season, Richards was named a finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy.

===New York Rangers (2011–2014)===

After becoming an unrestricted free agent, Richards signed a nine-year, $60 million contract with the New York Rangers on July 2, 2011, reuniting him with John Tortorella, his head coach from the 2004 Lightning team that won the Stanley Cup, and another member of that 2004 team, Ruslan Fedotenko. He was also approached by the Calgary Flames, Los Angeles Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

On October 8, 2011, Richards scored his first goal as a Ranger in a 2–1 shootout loss to the Anaheim Ducks. The game was played at the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm. He would go on to record 25 goals along with 41 assists during his first season with the Rangers, as well as six goals and nine assists in 20 playoff games, as the top seeded Rangers were ultimately eliminated from the 2012 playoffs by the sixth seeded New Jersey Devils in the third round in six games.

On April 19, 2013, Richards scored his first career NHL hat-trick in a game against the Buffalo Sabres.

On March 5, 2014, the Rangers acquired Martin St. Louis, reuniting the two, who were previously teammates when the Lightning won the cup in 2004. St. Louis and Richards both played integral roles in the Rangers&#x27; run to the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Kings.

On June 20, 2014, the Rangers used a compliance buyout on the remaining seven years of Richards&#x27; contract in an effort to increase salary cap space. This rendered him an unrestricted free agent, and ended the brief reunion between him and St. Louis.

===Chicago Blackhawks (2014–2015)===
On July 1, 2014, Richards signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. He wore number 91 for the Blackhawks, the first player in team history to do so, as his usual #19 was already being worn by Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews Richards played in his 1,000th career NHL game on November 16, 2014, against his former team, the Dallas Stars. In 76 regular season games with the Blackhawks, Richards scored 12 goals with 25 assists for 37 points as he played on the second line with Bryan Bickell and Patrick Kane.

The Blackhawks, with Richards, later faced one of his former teams, the Tampa Bay Lightning, in the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals. Chicago would prevail in six games, giving Richards his second Stanley Cup title. He assisted on Patrick Kane&#x27;s late 3rd period goal in the deciding Game 6 at the United Center, sealing the 4–2 series victory.

===Detroit Red Wings (2015–2016)===
On July 1, 2015, Richards signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings, worth up to $4 million with playoff bonuses. With Richards&#x27; traditional #19 retired for Steve Yzerman and #91 not having been worn in Detroit by anyone since Sergei Fedorov, Richards chose to wear #17 with the Red Wings, becoming the 3rd Prince Edward Island native to wear the jersey number with the club after Forbes Kennedy in 1958-60, and Gerard Gallant in 1985-93.

The Red Wings narrowly made the playoffs for the 25th consecutive season. Richards&#x27; late-season efforts included a game-tying goal against his former Rangers teammates on March 12 with 32 seconds remaining (the Red Wings later won the game 2–1 in overtime), and a two-point game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on April 2. He&#x27;d finish the season with 10 goals and 18 assists in 68 games. In the 2016 playoffs, Richards scored one goal as the Red Wings were eliminated in five games by the Lightning in Round 1. Had the Red Wings advanced, Richards was due a $250,000 bonus with an additional $750,000 available if they had won the second round as well.

On July 20, 2016, Richards announced his retirement from professional hockey. In a statement issued by the National Hockey League Players Association, Richards reflected on his Cup wins: &quot;Winning the Stanley Cups in Tampa Bay and Chicago was the best part of my career and I will never forget those moments. Nothing compares to enjoying that night with your team and knowing what you have accomplished together.&quot;

==Coaching Career==
On December 12, 2023, Brad Richards was selected to be a consultant for the St. Louis Blues after firing former head coach Craig Berube.

==Personal life==
During the off-season, Richards goes back to his birthplace of Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island. Richards has hosted the Brad Richards PEI Celebrity Golf Classic for the past six years. The event supports two charities: Children&#x27;s Wish Foundation, Prince Edward Island Chapter and Autism Society of Prince Edward Island. He is friends with &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; host Ron MacLean, who spends a lot of time in PEI. During his time with the Rangers, Richards lived in an apartment in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/news/brad-richards-rich-loved-manhattan-131000339--nhl.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards rented a suite at the St. Pete Times Forum (now called the Amalie Arena) for several Tampa Bay Lightning hockey games and invited families dealing with various forms of pediatric cancer to use it. After each game, he would go and visit the children who had come to watch the game. It began during the 2002–03 season and ended in 2008. When he was traded to the Dallas Stars, he continued his charity work with the Children&#x27;s Medical Center&#x27;s Oncology Department, supplying tickets for sick children. He also donates tickets to every home game to men and women in the military.

Richards underwent arthroscopic hip surgery on April 23, 2010, to repair a small labrum tear. In September 2010, he donated $500,000 to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown, PEI.

Richards and his Australian wife Rechelle have two children. Richards speaks both English and French.

<text>Canada has never maintained or possessed weapons of mass destruction. Canada participated in NATO’s nuclear mission between 1963 and 1984, which included the hosting of US nuclear weapons on its soil. Canada ratified the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in 1970.

==Nuclear weapons==
=== Introduction ===
The first US nuclear weapon entered Canada in 1950 when the US Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) stationed 11 model 1561 Fat Man atomic bombs at RCAF Station Goose Bay in Labrador. Goose Bay was used as an aircraft staging location for both the SAC and the Royal Air Force&#x27;s V Force. The bombs were landed; crews relieved; aircraft refueled, or repaired; without returning to bases in the continental US. Nuclear weapons designs of the time were easily damaged but precise devices, that required off-aircraft inspection (after landing), and environmental sheltering (at a secure warm/dry location) while their carrier aircraft was on the ground for routine maintenance or repair.

From 1963 to 1984, the US deployed a total of four tactical nuclear weapons systems in Canada, which amounted to several hundred nuclear warheads.

Throughout the Cold War, Canada was closely aligned with defensive elements of United States programs in both NORAD and NATO. In 1964, Canada sent its &quot;White Paper on Defence&quot; to U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to ensure he would not, &quot;find anything in these references contrary to any views [he] may have expressed,&quot; although &quot;references&quot; may indicate quotes or glosses in the paper attributed to him, which they wished him to verify as authentic and correct, thus making the gesture a polite courtesy.

Three of the four nuclear-capable weapons systems were withdrawn by the United States by 1972. The single system retained, the AIR-2 Genie had a yield of 1.5 kilotons, and was designed to strike enemy aircraft as opposed to ground targets.

=== Early history: World War II and into the Cold War ===
Canada&#x27;s military relationship with the United States has grown significantly since the Second World War. Although the Dominion of Canada came into being on July 1, 1867, Canadian foreign policy was determined in Britain. Canada entered the Great War in 1914 when Great Britain declared war on Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire: Constitutionally, Canada was subject to the British declaration of war, as were other British Dominion countries. Canadian foreign policy became independent in December 1931 (save for the issues of Commonwealth/Dominion war and peace) with the passage of the Statute of Westminster.
On September 10, 1939, Canada declared war on Germany, a week later than Great Britain. Following the German declaration of war on the United States on December 11, 1941, the U.S. declared war on Germany the same day. This was three days after declaring war on Japan on December 8 following the December 7 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii. Canada had actually declared war on Japan on December 7, a day earlier than the US and the UK&#x27;s declaration.

One of the first formal agreements for military cooperation was made in August 1940. Known as the Ogdensburg Agreement, it established the Permanent Joint Board on Defence.
Both the United States and Canada are founding members of the United Nations as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 1957, they signed the NORAD Agreement, which created the North American Air Defense Command to defend the continent against attacks from the USSR.

In the 1942 &quot;Quebec Agreement&quot;, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to develop the &quot;Tube Alloys&quot; Project and created a committee to manage the project which included C. D. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply. This was the code name for the British Uranium Committee project which had worked on a theoretical design for an atomic bomb. One significant contribution was a calculation of the critical mass of uranium. The mass was less than earlier estimates and suggested that development of a fission bomb was practical.
This calculation had been part of shipment of secret scientific and technical research in Great Britain that was shared with the United States to get American support for the war and American production of this new equipment. Materials shared through the Tizard Mission included the cavity magnetron which improved radar, British information related to the German Enigma machines, jet engine designs as well as the Frisch-Peierls memorandum.
Canada&#x27;s role in the Manhattan Project besides providing raw material, including uranium ore from a northern mine which may have been used in the construction of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, was to provide at least one scientist working at Los Alamos (Louis Slotin), and hosting the Montreal Laboratory which took over from Tube Alloys. Canada would continue to supply fissionable material to the US and other allies throughout the Cold War although Canada never developed indigenous nuclear weapons as did NATO allies France and the United Kingdom.

After briefly allowing nuclear weapons to be temporarily stationed in Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada agreed to a long term lease of the Goose Bay base to the US Strategic Air Command. The Americans were refused permission to stockpile bomb casings for the B-36 at Goose Bay. These bombs would have been armed in wartime with materials brought from the United States. Goose Bay was used as a base for air refueling tankers which were to support the SAC B-47 and B-52 bomber forces.

In 1951 the Pinetree Line was established north of the US-Canada border, and in 1953 Canada built the Mid-Canada Line, which was manned by the Canadian military. In 1954 the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW) was established jointly by the US and Canada in the Arctic. 
The Pinetree Line was built to control the air battle between the NORAD interceptor forces and manned Soviet bombers. Beginning with Ground-controlled interception updated from the Second World War, the system has been computerized and automated with at least four new generations of technology being employed. It was clear, even in the early years of the Cold War, that on paper, Canada and the US were to be jointly responsible for the defence of the continent. In execution, Canadian investment in air defence has decreased significantly with the decline of the intercontinental strategic bomber threat. In the 1950s the RCAF contributed fourteen squadrons of CF-100 interceptors and this was reduced to three squadrons of CF-101s by 1970. Some of this is due to improved technology but more is due to the decline of the bomber threat and reductions in Canadian military spending.

=== Inventory of Canada&#x27;s nuclear armaments ===

Goose Air Base in Labrador was the site of the first US nuclear weapons in Canada, when in 1950 the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command stationed 11 model 1561 Fat Man and Mark 4 atomic bombs at the base in the summer, and flew them out in December. While returning to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base with one of the bombs on board, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber encountered engine trouble, had to drop, and conventionally detonate, the bomb over the St. Lawrence river, contaminating the river with uranium-238. The detonation was near Saint-André-de-Kamouraska. In 1953, Strategic Air Command constructed ten new reinforced concrete buildings as part of a heavily secured weapon storage area located at , surrounded by two barbed wire fences and several armed guard towers. Goose Air Base Weapons Storage Area was the only weapons storage area in Canada constructed to house the Mark 4, AIM-26 Falcon, and AIR-2 Genie nuclear weapons. 

On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1963, the Royal Canadian Air Force delivered a shipment of nuclear warheads to the Bomarc missile site near RCAF Station North Bay. The Government of Canada never publicly admitted to the presence of nuclear weapons on Canadian bases in Canada and Germany but their presence was common knowledge at the time. It is generally understood that the Bomarc missile warheads were delivered on this cold (-13 degrees Celsius) winter night when a group of protesters stood down from a vigil at the gates of the missile site. It was said they assumed that the RCAF would be unlikely to work on this traditional evening of celebration. The delivery was photographed by the press and this revealed to the world that the delivery had taken place.

The warheads were never in the sole possession of Canadian personnel. They were the property of the Government of the United States and were always under the direct supervision of a &quot;Custodial Detachment&quot; from the United States Air Force (or Army, in the case of Honest John warheads).

Through 1984, Canada would deploy four American designed nuclear weapons delivery systems accompanied by hundreds of warheads:
* 56 CIM-10 BOMARC surface-to-air missiles.
* 4 MGR-1 Honest John rocket systems, each with four rockets and four warheads, for a total of 16 W31 nuclear warheads the Canadian Army deployed in Germany.
* 108 nuclear W25 Genie rockets carried by 54 CF-101 Voodoos.
* estimates of 90 to 210 tactical (20–60 kiloton) nuclear warheads assigned to 6 CF-104 Starfighter squadrons (about 90 aircraft) based with NATO in Europe (there is a lack of open sources detailing exactly how many warheads were deployed).
In practice, each of 36 NATO squadrons (initially six Canadian squadrons Number 1 Air Division RCAF) would provide two aircraft and pilots to a Quick Reaction Alert facility. The &#x27;Q&#x27; aircraft could be launched with an armed US nuclear weapon within 15 minutes of receiving the &#x27;go&#x27; order. This arrangement was called the NATO Quick Reaction Alert Force. It provided a dispersed force upwards of 100 strike aircraft for use on short notice. Missions were targeted at troop concentrations, airfields, bridges, assembly and choke points and other tactical targets in order to slow the massive tank formations of the Red Army as they poured into the Fulda Gap and on towards the Rhine River.

In total, there were between 250 and 450 nuclear warheads on Canadian bases between 1963 and 1972. There were at most 108 Genie missiles armed with 1.5 kiloton W25 warheads present from 1963 to 1984. There may have been fewer due to attrition of CF-101s as the program aged and as incoming CF-18s became combat-qualified. In addition, between 1968 and 1994 the United States stored the Mk 101 Lulu and B57 nuclear bombs at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland.

This number decreased significantly through the years as various systems were withdrawn from service. The Honest John was retired by the Canadian Army in 1970. The Bomarc missile was phased out in 1972 and the CF-104 Strike/Attack squadrons in West Germany were reduced in number and reassigned to conventional ground attack at about the same time. From late in 1972, the CF-101 interceptor force remained as the only nuclear-armed system in Canadian use until it was replaced by the CF-18 in 1984.

=== Cold War relationship with the US ===

Canada&#x27;s Cold War military doctrine and fate was inextricably tied with that of the United States. The two nations shared responsibility for continental air defence through NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) and both belonged to NATO and contributed forces in Europe. Should nuclear war with the USSR have broken out, Canada would have been in harm&#x27;s way because of the geographic position between both the USSR and US. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Canadian White Paper on Defence&quot; acknowledged this reality citing that, &quot;Soviet strategic planners must regard Canada and the United States as a single set of military targets no matter what political posture we might assume.&quot; This sums up Canada&#x27;s Cold War predicament well, as Canada&#x27;s geo-political relationship with the US meant that Canada would inevitably be widely devastated by any US-Soviet nuclear exchange, whether it was targeted or not. It led to a familiar phrase of the time, &quot;incineration without representation&quot;.

The DEW Line and Pinetree Line radar systems formed the backbone of continental air defense in the 1950s and 1960s. The most likely routes for Soviet aircraft attacking the United States came through Canada. In particular, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States would be approached through the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap and a line of SAGE search radars ran down the coast of Labrador and southeast to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. These stations were supported by RCAF CF-101 interceptors at Bagotville, Quebec and Chatham, New Brunswick, as well as USAF F-102 interceptors stationed at Ernest Harmon Air Base in Stephenville, Newfoundland. These were presumably equipped with nuclear-armed AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon missiles as this was a standard configuration on the F-102.

Canada hosted no intercontinental strategic bombers but the Strategic Air Command base at Goose Bay Labrador hosted a large number of KC-135 air refueling tankers. These were intended to top up the fuel tanks of the outbound B-52 strike force headed for targets in the USSR. They also supported the SAC Airborne Alert Force and would have refueled any surviving bombers returning from the USSR.

=== &quot;Incineration without representation&quot; ===
For the Canadian public, &quot;incineration without representation&quot; led to a popular belief that the doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) was in Canada&#x27;s best interest. MAD was the Cold War doctrine which held that as long as both the US and USSR possessed significant nuclear arsenals, any nuclear war would assuredly destroy both nations, thereby discouraging either state from launching any nuclear offensive. For Canadians, MAD was appealing in this light, as Canada was unlikely to emerge from any nuclear exchange unscathed given its position between the two countries, considering that any weapons shot down or falling short were likely to fall on Canadian soil.

In Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Defence White Paper&quot;, this dynamic was noted:

:&quot;One of the most important changes in international affairs in recent years had been the increase in stability of nuclear deterrence, and the emergence of what is, in effect, nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviet Union. Each side now has sufficient nuclear strength to assure devastating retaliation in the event of a surprise attack by the other, and thus neither could rationally consider launching a deliberate attack.&quot;

Even as late as 1987, Prime Minister Mulroney&#x27;s &quot;Defence White Paper&quot; acknowledged that, &quot;each superpower now has the capacity to obliterate the other,…the structure of mutual deterrence today is effective and stable. The Government believes that it must remain so.&quot; Given the prospect of &quot;incineration without representation&quot;, Canadians seemed to feel that the doctrine which most encouraged restraint was the strategically soundest one to support.

Canadians were still nervous about U.S. foreign policy, however. In 1950, when U.S. President Harry S. Truman announced that Washington had not entirely ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson recalled that the remarks caused Ottawa to collectively &quot;shudder&quot;. One Cold War contemporary observer even remarked that,

:&quot;Canadians often think that their neighbour to the south exhibits wild swings of emotional attachments… with other countries; that it is impatient, is prone to making sweeping judgments, and generally lacks sophistication and subtlety in its approach to the Soviet bloc and the cold war.&quot;

However, if Canadian leadership was nervous about U.S. foreign policy, they did not voice their discontent through actions. Canada was consistently and significantly cooperative with the United States when it came to nuclear weapons doctrine and deployments through the Cold War.

=== Continued cooperation with the U.S. to present ===
The Government of Canada formally agreed to every major North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) strategic document, including those that implied a US strike-first policy. This may suggest that successive Canadian governments were willing to follow US and NATO doctrine even if said doctrine was counter to the publicly favoured (and politically supported) doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction. Professors J.T. Jockel and J.J. Sokolsky explore this assertion in-depth in their article &quot;Canada&#x27;s Cold War Nuclear Experience&quot;. Furthermore, Canada allowed for forward deployment of US bombers and participated actively and extensively in the NORAD program; as well, Canada cooperated with the US when it came to research, early warning, surveillance and communications. Canada was second only to West Germany in hosting nuclear related facilities. In short, the Canadian Government was thoroughly committed to supporting US nuclear doctrine and deployments through the Cold War, in spite of any popular reservations concerning this dynamic.

While it has no more permanently stationed nuclear weapons as of 1984, Canada continues to cooperate with the United States and its nuclear weapons program. Canada allows testing of nuclear weapon delivery systems; nuclear weapon carrying vessels are permitted to visit Canadian ports; and aircraft carrying nuclear warheads are permitted to fly in Canadian airspace with the permission of the Canadian government. There is, however, popular objection to this federal policy. Over 60% of Canadians live in cities or areas designated &quot;Nuclear Weapons Free&quot;, reflecting a contemporary disinclination toward nuclear weapons in Canada. Canada also remains under the NATO &#x27;nuclear umbrella&#x27;; even after disarming itself in 1984, Canada has maintained support for nuclear armed nations as doing otherwise would be counter to Canadian NATO commitments.

==Chemical weapons==
During both World War I and World War II, Canada was a major producer and developer of chemical weapons for the Allied war effort. These were used in combat in World War I, but not in World War II. Human experimentation was carried out during World War II, with Experimental Station Suffield becoming the leading research facility. Thousands of Canadian soldiers were exposed to mustard gas, blister agents, tear gas, and other chemical agents, and some were permanently injured as a result. Following both world wars, Canadian military forces returning home were directed to dump millions of tons of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) into the Atlantic Ocean off ports in Nova Scotia; an undetermined amount of these UXOs are known to be chemical weapons. The 1972 London Convention prohibited further marine dumping of UXOs, however the chemical weapons existing off the shores of Nova Scotia for over 60 years continue to bring concern to local communities and the fishing industry.

Human testing of chemical weapons such as sarin, mustard gas, and VX gas continued in Canada into the early 1970s. These tests left Canada with large stockpiles of chemical weapons. Canada eventually abandoned the use of lethal chemical weapons, and had to devote a great deal of effort to safely destroying them. Since 1990, the Biological and Chemical Defence Review Committee has conducted annual site visits and inspections to verify that all remaining military activities involving chemical warfare agents are defensive in nature. Canada ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention on September 26, 1995. Canada still employs riot control agents, such as tear gas and pepper spray, which are classified as non-lethal weapons for domestic law enforcement purposes.

==Biological weapons==
Canada had a biological warfare research program in the early to middle part of the 20th century. Canadian research involved developing protections against biowarfare attacks and for offensive purposes, often with the help of the UK and the US. Canada has thus experimented with such things as weaponized anthrax, botulinum toxin, ricin, rinderpest virus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, plague, Brucellosis and tularemia. CFB Suffield is the leading research centre. Canada says it has destroyed all military stockpiles and no longer conducts toxin warfare research. As with chemical weapons, the Biological and Chemical Defence Review Committee has since 1990 conducted annual site visits and inspections at CFB Suffield and elsewhere to verify that all remaining military activities involving biological warfare agents are purely defensive in nature. Canada ratified the Biological Weapons Convention on September 18, 1972.

==Disarmament==
Canada is a member of every international disarmament organization and is committed to pushing for an end to nuclear weapons testing, reduction in nuclear arsenals, a ban on all chemical and biological weapons, bans on weapons in outer space, and blocks on nuclear proliferation. However, in recent years it has become less vocal on the issue of disarmament; the need for increased border defence, particularly in the Territories, has recently overshadowed other issues in military circles.

Canada maintains a division of its Foreign Affairs department devoted to pursuing these ends. It also dedicates significant resources in trying to verify that current treaties are being obeyed, passing much information on to the United Nations. In the 1970s, Canada discussed building a reconnaissance satellite to monitor adherence to such treaties, but these plans were shelved. A public furor arose in 1983, when the Canadian government approved a plan to test cruise missiles in Alberta.

Canada continues to promote peaceful nuclear technology exemplified by the CANDU reactor. Unlike most designs, the CANDU does not require enriched fuel, and in theory is therefore much less likely to lead to the development of weapon-grade fissionables. However, like all power reactor designs, CANDU reactors produce and use plutonium in their fuel rods during normal operation (roughly 50% of the energy generated in a CANDU reactor comes from the &quot;in situ&quot; fission of plutonium created in the uranium fuel), and this plutonium could be used in a nuclear explosive if separated and converted to metallic form (albeit only as reactor-grade plutonium, and therefore of limited military usefulness). Accordingly, CANDU reactors, like most power reactors in the world, are subject to safeguards under the United Nations which prevent possible diversion of plutonium. CANDU reactors are designed to be refuelled while running, which makes the details of such safeguards significantly different from other reactor designs. The end result, however, is a consistent and internationally accepted level of proliferation risk. The CANDU reactor was also proposed as a means of destroying surplus plutonium through using MOX fuel due to its capability of online fuel shuffling providing flexibility to deal with different reactor kinetics.

<text>The Open Constitution Initiative (OCI) (), sometimes referred to in English as Gongmeng, was an organization consisting of lawyers and academics in the People&#x27;s Republic of China that advocated for the rule of law and greater constitutional protections. It was established by Peking University Law School scholars Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, Yu Jiang, and Zhang Xingshui in 2003, and was shut down by the Chinese government in 2009.

== Proposed Constitutional Amendments ==

In 2004, the group proposed amendment to include “human rights” in the Constitution, and petitioned it to the National People&#x27;s Congress.

==Background==
Since 2002, online independent media and tabloids have played an important role in political discourse within Chinese society. Many Chinese intellectuals have used the Internet to discuss the possible evolution of Chinese politics. The OCI is a group of such intellectuals whose website contained essays about constitutional issues and the protection of citizen&#x27;s rights. One notable lawyer who is part of the group is Xu Zhiyong.

==Activities==

===2003===
Xu Zhiyong, Teng Biao, and another doctoral student from Peking University raised the unconstitutionality of the investigation in the Sun Zhigang case; initiated a grassroots local people’s congress primary election procedure.

===2004===
Participated in the drafting of a proposed amendment to include “human rights” in the Constitution, submitted to the National People&#x27;s Congress; followed the Henan incident where authorities forcibly closed the HIV/AIDS orphanage known as “Home of Care and Love”; defended Yu Huafeng and Cheng Yizhong, the General Manager and Editor in Chief, respectively, of the Southern Metropolitan Daily; participated in representing the four innocent Chengde citizens who were sentenced, five times, to the death penalty; organized a symposium to discuss the legitimacy of the relocation of the Beijing Zoo. 

On 8 June 2004, Chinese internet authorities shut down its web site without specifying a precise reason. The crackdown came during a time of heightened political tension regarding the Taiwan Straits and the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and also during events symbolic of China&#x27;s increasing international interdependence, such as the visit of the Greek Olympian envoy.

===2005===
Conducted research on China’s petitioning (“xinfang”) system; pushed for Local People’s Congress Delegate Reception Day; researched the local people’s congress system; began writing the 2005 Report on the Development of Human Rights in China.

===2006===
Completed the 2005 Report on the Development of Human Rights in China; followed the Beijing taxi price hike and reform of the management system; completed the Research Report on China’s Xinfang System; monitored the direct election of the Haidian District of Beijing Municipality Local People’s Congress; spoke out for the education rights of migrant children; wrote proposed legislative amendments to the Beijing Measures on the Administration of Dog Ownership.

===2007===
Assisted with the administrative suit on behalf of victims of the illegal brick kilns; followed the Zhongguancun demolition and relocation case; launched various citizen participation activities.

===2008===
Organized a Pro Bono Legal Aid Team to conduct public interest litigation on behalf of victims of the tainted milk scandal; promoted direct elections within the Beijing Lawyers Association.

===2009===
Released an investigative report into the causes of the 3.14 incident in Tibet; launched activities to promote open government information, including requesting the disclosure of three specific types of public expenditures; hosted a legal organization training workshop where legal knowledge relating to rights defence and elections was discussed; provided legal aid to Deng Yujiao, victims of &quot;black jails&quot;, and petitioners; launched residence committee elections and organized symposiums on Green Dam, mental disability, and many more issues; in order to guide public opinion on a path of rational development, expressed public opinion on many important issues. 

The organization published a report criticising the Chinese government&#x27;s policy towards Tibet, alleging that propaganda was being used to mask failings in its Tibet policy, such as ethnic inequality and creating &quot;an aristocracy of corrupt and abusive government officials&quot;. It has been regarded as a more balanced view of the situation in Tibet and has had approval circulating through discussion websites in China, though the Chinese government has yet to comment. 

===Closure===
On July 14, 2009, the organization was fined 1.46 million RMB. On July 17, 2009, authorities declared the organization &quot;illegal&quot; and shut it down. On 29 July 2009, Xu Zhiyong was arrested on charges of &#x27;tax evasion&#x27;. He was subsequently released on bail on 23 August 2009. On August 21, 2010, the public security bureau of Beijing dropped all the charges, returned all its items formerly held in custody, and released Xu from bail. Xu and others continued their works and activities with a new organization name Gongmin (&quot;citizen(s)&quot;, ). However, his administrative assistant, Zhuang Lu, is reported to have disappeared, possibly held in a detention house in Beijing.

<doc id="711002" wikidata="Q10752019" url="?curid=711002" title="2004 Venezuelan recall referendum">
<text>The Venezuelan recall referendum of 15 August 2004 was a referendum to determine whether Hugo Chávez, then President of Venezuela, should be recalled from office. The recall referendum was announced on 8 June 2004 by the National Electoral Council (CNE) after the Venezuelan opposition succeeded in collecting the number of signatures required by the 1999 Constitution to effect a recall. The result of the referendum was not to recall Chávez (59% no).

The opposition Coordinadora Democrática declared that fraud had taken place and published a preliminary report supporting the conclusions. The Carter Center, the electoral observers and other analysts denied fraud, saying the referendum was performed in a free and fair manner. The Carter Center released a paper and statistical analysis at the request of the NGO Súmate to evaluate a study by Ricardo Hausmann and Roberto Rigobon, reaffirming the center&#x27;s original conclusions.

Statistical evaluations published in 2006 and 2011 concluded that fraud was committed.

==Petition==
The recall mechanism was introduced into Venezuelan law in 1999 under the new Constitution drafted by the National Constituent Assembly and sanctioned by the electorate in a referendum. Under its provisions, an elected official can be subjected to a recall referendum if a petition gathers signatures from 20% of the corresponding electorate. Thus, to order a presidential recall vote in 2004, 2.4 million signatures were needed - 20% of the national electorate.

===Constitutional basis===
The recall referendum is provided for in two articles of the 1999 Constitution:
:

:

=== Protests ===

In February 2003, the National Electoral Council announced that the signatures presented to request the recall referendum had to be examined a second time. Protests against the decision began on 27 February 2004 in Caracas and fifteen other cities of the country, lasting five consecutive days. Negotiations between the opposition and government agreeing on signatures led to the end of the protests. During the protests, 9 people were killed, of which at least 4 were due to the response of security officials, hundreds were injured and 300 were arrested.

===Signature collection drive===
In August 2003, about 3.2 million signatures were presented by &quot;Súmate&quot;, a Venezuelan volunteer civil association, founded in 2002. These signatures were rejected by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on the grounds that they had been collected prematurely; i.e., before the midpoint of the presidential term.

In September 2003, that the government used a &quot;rapid reaction&quot; squad to raid the offices of CNE, the government body overseeing the petition drive, where the petitions were stored.

In November 2003, the opposition collected a new set of signatures, with 3.6 million names produced in four days. The CNE rejected the petition, saying that only 1.9 million were valid, while 1.1 million were dubious and 460,000 completely invalid. Reaction to the decision to reject the petition (for the second time) resulted in riots that led to nine dead, 339 arrested, and 1,200 injured.

The petitioners appealed to the Electoral Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court. The court reinstated over 800,000 of the disputed signatures, bringing the total to 2.7 million, above the 2.4 million needed to authorise the referendum. However, about a week later, the Constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court overturned the Electoral chamber&#x27;s ruling alleging that the latter did not have jurisdiction for that ruling.

The list of signatories was subsequently collected by the government.

The names of petition signers were posted publicly online in what became known as the Tascón List. The president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation was quoted by the Associated Press as claiming that the Chávez government had begun dismissing petition signers from government ministries, the state oil company, the state water company, the Caracas Metro, and public hospitals and municipal governments controlled by Chávez&#x27;s party. The Associated Press also quoted Venezuela&#x27;s Health Minister as justifying petition related layoffs by saying &quot;all those who have signed to activate the recall referendum against President Chávez should be fired from the Health Ministry&quot;. He retracted these remarks several days later by saying that they were his own personal opinions and not a matter of public policy.

The CNE later admitted that 15,863 signatures of those signatures that were verified in May 2004 belonged to people who had died in 2003.

===Timing===
The date chosen for the recall referendum was significant: had the recall vote been held on 19 August or later, Chávez would have been into the fifth year of his six-year term and had he been voted out, Vice President José Vicente Rangel would have taken over and served out the rest of Chávez&#x27;s presidency (in accordance with Article 233 of the Constitution, above). With the vote called for 15 August, Chávez was not yet into the last two years of his term in office; an unfavourable result would therefore have meant the calling of fresh presidential elections within the following 30 days. Chávez had expressed his clear intention to stand in the election, had he been recalled; the opposition factions, however, maintained that he would have been disqualified from doing so.

==Campaign==

Between late May 2004, when the CNE set the referendum date, and 15 August, the date chosen, a contentious campaign took place, with both sides convinced of victory.

==Opinion polls==
Although support for Chávez had been low in 2003 and early 2004, polling data showed a shift as the campaign got under way. Most polls, including those by firms linked to the opposition which had showed low support for Chávez in 2003 and early 2004, predicted a rejection of the recall in the weeks before the referendum.

Pre-referendum polls, both by opposition and by pro-Chávez groups, during the previous months and weeks predicted the &quot;No&quot; vote to win by a margin of between 5% and 31%. For example, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research (GQR) Inc. and DATOS, both commissioned by the opposition, found margins in favour of &quot;No&quot; by 5% and 12% respectively in June 2004; Datanálisis found a margin of 14% in favour of Chávez in June. On 11 August, Robert Jensen wrote that recent polls ranged from 8% to 31% for margins in favour of the &quot;No&quot; vote.

==Ballot==

The following question was put to the Venezuelan electorate:
:&quot;¿Está usted de acuerdo con dejar sin efecto el mandato popular otorgado mediante elecciones democráticas legítimas al ciudadano Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías como presidente de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela para el actual período presidencial? ¿NO o SÍ?&quot;
Translated into English:
:&quot;Do you agree to revoke, for the current term, the popular mandate as President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela conferred on citizen Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías through democratic and legitimate elections? NO or YES?&quot;

For the recall to be successful, there were three conditions:
* A turnout of at least 25% of the country&#x27;s 14.25 million registered voters.
* More votes against Chávez than the number who voted for him in the 2000 presidential election (3.76 million).
* More &quot;yes&quot; votes cast than &quot;no&quot; votes.

==Referendum day==
Polling stations opened at 6 am Venezuelan time on 15 August 2004. Later in the day, faced with a 70% turnout, lengthy queues of waiting voters, and delays exacerbated by the use of novel electronic voting equipment and fingerprint scanners, the electoral authorities agreed to extend the close of voting twice: a four-hour extension of the deadline that took it to 8 p.m., followed by an additional four hours announced later in the evening, which took it to midnight.

A record number of voters turned out to defeat the recall attempt with a 59% &quot;no&quot; vote. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, who was in Venezuela to observe the electoral process, said of the patiently waiting Venezuelan electors, &quot;This is the largest turnout I have ever seen.&quot; In previous presidential elections, turnout figures were at an average 55%.

All Venezuelans aged 18 and up whose names appear on the electoral roll were eligible to vote, including those residing abroad: polling stations were set up in Venezuelan embassies and consulates abroad.

===Parody recording===
At 3:50pm local time on 15 August, CNE rector Jorge Rodríguez and CNE president Francisco Carrasquero announced on national television that they had found an audio CD where a imitation voice of Carrasquero declared that the opposition had won the referendum with a total of 11,436,086 &quot;yes&quot; votes, and that Chávez&#x27;s mandate was thereby revoked. Since this was several hours before the closing of the polling booths, and since Carrasquero declared the recording to be fake, this appeared to be a case of attempted sabotage of the referendum. The attorney-general was called on to conduct a full inquiry into the incident and to locate and arrest those responsible for the spurious audio recording.

Journalist Fausto Malavé declared in an interview in RCR that the recording was an evident parody that had been circulating in city streets for at least two months, claiming that it was surprising that it was only brought to public attention then. He also expressed concern at the significance that was attributed to it by the CNE.

===Exit polling===
Coordinadora Democrática commissioned an exit poll from the American firm of Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland, which showed Chávez losing by a 60–40 margin. PSB used volunteers from Súmate, a NGO which was the primary organizer of the recall referendum, and involved around 200 polling places out of 8500. With over 20,000 responses the exit poll produced a much larger amount of data than most opinion polls (typically around 1000 responses), leading to an extremely low sampling error. However, the Center for Economic and Policy Research suggested that since the chance of sample error in the exit poll was so low and observers did not find any signs of fraud, it may have been the survey&#x27;s methodology that led to the discrepancy in results. PSB was criticized in the press for how the poll was carried out considering the Súmate group had been involved in organizing the recall and was considered anti-Chávez by the Venezuelan government.

Publication or broadcast of exit polls was banned by electoral authorities, but results of the PSB poll went out to media outlets and opposition offices several hours before polls closed. Jimmy Carter said that Súmate &quot;deliberately distributed this erroneous exit poll data in order to build up, not only the expectation of victory, but also to influence the people still standing in line&quot;.

==Result==
The preliminary result was announced on 16 August 2004 on national television and radio after 94% of the vote had been counted, with 58% having voted no and 42% voted yes.. According to these early-morning results, the first condition (a quorum of 25% of the electorate) had been satisfied. The second condition (more votes against Chávez than he received in 2000) would probably be satisfied. However, the third condition (a simple majority: more people voting &quot;yes&quot; than &quot;no&quot;) had clearly failed.

The final results showed 59% had voted no.

==Disputes==
===Electoral fraud complaints===
After the preliminary results were broadcast, the opposition Coordinadora Democrática declared that fraud had taken place, stating that its own data (the Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland exit poll, which was performed by volunteers from Súmate, the NGO which had organized the referendum) put the &quot;Yes&quot; vote at 59% and the &quot;No&quot; vote at 40%. Their exit poll showed the opposite result to the official voting data, predicting that Chávez would lose by 20%, whereas the election results showed him to have won by 20%. A poll company representative, Schoen commented, &quot;I think it was a massive fraud&quot;. Coordinadora Democrática also told the press that no opposition representation was present when the votes were counted and that the physical ballots had not yet been taken into account.

Constitutional lawyer Tulio Álvarez, representative of the Coordinadora Democrática, published a preliminary report entitled &quot;Fraud to Democracy&quot;, the result of the work of 40 professionals diversified in 14 thematic areas, concluding that &quot;qualitative, continued, selective, massive fraud&quot; occurred in the manual and automated procedures, for which the coalition decided to challenge the process. The report explains that it was detected that in Venezuela the scheme of the electoral population averages was broken and in two months it went from 48 points to 53 points of proportion in the electoral population, meaning that close to 1.8 million people who never voted were accounted for, a mobilization of a non-existent population was made to commit fraud in the manual voting according to the report. The study states that mostnew registrants were oriented to rural centers or urban areas of manual voting, in an attempt to disguise the electronic fraud with a voting trend in favor of the &quot;No&quot; option. In the automated process, a collective manipulation of 28% of the vote was detected, which &quot;compromises officials of the National Electoral Council and of the company in charge of the automation&quot;. Likewise, evidence of &quot;bidirectionality of communication&quot; was found, since according to the data obtained from CANTV there was traffic to and from the machines before printing the ballots, and it is indicated that there was &quot;a pattern of communications intervention. At certain hours, traffic was concentrated to receive information, send and manipulate it&quot;, transmissions &quot;outside the allowed hours, since 7:00 a.m.&quot;, when it was established that &quot;the machine would not be connected until the closing of the process&quot;.

Some individuals have disputed the center&#x27;s endorsement of the electoral process in the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004. Fox News&#x27; Doug Schoen told Michael Barone at &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the Venezuelan central commission. There are widespread reports of irregularities and evidence of fraud, many of them ably recorded by Mary Anastasia O&#x27;Grady in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; last week. Carter is untroubled by any of this, and declares that Chavez won &#x27;fair and square.&#x27;&quot; The Carter Center looked into the allegations and released a paper and statistical analysis reaffirming their original conclusions.

===Process endorsements===
The day before the polling, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter expressed confidence that the vote would proceed in a calm and orderly fashion. Carter commented that, &quot;I might project results that will be much more satisfactory than they were in 2000 in Florida&quot;.

On the afternoon of 16 August 2004, Carter and OAS Secretary General César Gaviria gave a joint press conference in which they endorsed the preliminary results announced by the CNE. The monitors&#x27; findings &quot;coincided with the partial returns announced today by the National Elections Council&quot; said Carter, while Gaviria added that the OAS electoral observation mission&#x27;s members had &quot;found no element of fraud in the process&quot;. Directing his remarks at opposition figures who made claims of &quot;widespread fraud&quot; in the voting, Carter called on all Venezuelans to &quot;accept the results and work together for the future&quot;. The Carter Center &quot;concluded the results were accurate.&quot;

The U.S. Department of State accepted that the results of the subsequent audit were &quot;consistent with the results announced by (Venezuela&#x27;s) National Electoral Council.&quot; John Maisto, U.S. Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States, added that the results of the referendum &quot;speak for themselves&quot;, saying that the quest for Venezuelan democracy &quot;does not end with a single electoral process or referendum&quot; and urging the &quot;democratically elected government of Venezuela to address and recognize the legitimate concerns, rights, and aspirations of all of its citizens&quot;. Regarding the recall effort, in testimony before the U.S. Senate, Maisto also pointed out that Carter had said that &quot; &#x27;expression of the citizen must be privileged over excessive technicalities&#x27; in resolving issues surrounding the tabulation of the signatures&quot;.

European Union observers did not oversee the elections, saying too many restrictions were put on their participation by the Chávez administration.

===Analyses===
Economists Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard University and Roberto Rigobón of the MIT Sloan School of Management performed a statistical analysis at Súmate&#x27;s request, analyzing how fraud could have occurred during the referendum. They concluded that the vote samples audited by the government were not a random representation of all precincts, noting that the Chávez-backed CNE had &quot;refused to use the random number generating program offered by the Carter Center for the 18 August audit and instead used its own program installed in its own computer and initialed with their own seed.&quot; They also noted that opposition witnesses and international observers were not allowed near the computer hub on election day. According to &quot;the Wall Street Journal&quot;, a computer-science professor at Johns Hopkins University said, &quot;The Hausmann/Rigobon study is more credible than many of the other allegations being thrown around.&quot; The Carter Center looked into the allegations and released a paper with a statistical analysis in response; this stated that the audit sample data, in particular the statistical correlation between the number of &quot;Yes&quot; voters and the number of petition signatories in each audited voting centre, were consistent with nationwide results, and reaffirmed the Carter Center&#x27;s earlier conclusions.

The Center for Economic and Policy Research drew on the Carter Center analysis and elaborated on the issue, criticising Hausmann and Rigobón&#x27;s statistical model. Furthermore, the CEPR analysis noted that &quot;although Hausmann and Rigobón&#x27;s analysis does not require this data to be accurate, it does require that its errors be uncorrelated with those of the signatures, something that cannot be assumed without any verifiable knowledge or observation of where the data came from.

Javier Corrales wrote in the Foreign Policy Magazine that the opposition was &quot;shocked not so much by the results as by the ease with which international observers condoned the Electoral Council&#x27;s flimsy audit of the results.&quot; The sample for the audit was selected by the government controlled National Electoral Council and, according to the opposition, was not of sufficient size to be statistically reliable.

Election observers insisted that no fraud had taken place, but scholarly analyses published over the years to come disagreed. A statistical study by Maria M. Febres Cordero and Bernardo Márquez was published in 2006 in a peer-reviewed academic statistics journal. The study used cluster analysis to review differences in vote patterns between voting certificates on the basis that voters were randomly assigned to certificates (each voting center had on average 2 or 3 certificates, typically for computerised and manual voting systems). It concluded: &quot;[The] Venezuelan opposition has statistical evidence to reject the official results given by the CNE. The irregularities detected were observed consistently in numerous voting centers and the magnitude of the irregularities imply that the official results do not reflect the intention of voters with statistical confidence.&quot; They estimated that 56.4% had voted yes to recall Chavez, as opposed to the official result of 41%.

The presence of systemic election fraud was also supported by six analyses in a special section in the November 2011 issue of &quot;Statistical Science&quot;. Raquel Prado and Bruno Sansó examined the exit polls; Luis Raul Pericchi and David A Torres examined the no-votes against the Newcomb-Benford law; Isbelia Martin discovered anomalous patterns in telecommunications; Ricardo Hausmann and Roberto I. Rigobón analyzed patterns related to exit polls; Raúl Jiménez examined the distribution of valid votes, null votes, and abstentions in each precinct; while Gustavo Delfino and Guillermo Salas reported on the anomalous relation between signatures requesting the recall, and the yes-votes. The section is introduced by an article written by Alicia L. Carriquiry. One of the papers, by Hausmann and Rigobón, was a later version of a paper disputed by the Carter Center, and contains a response to that criticism.

<doc id="711003" wikidata="Q2545719" url="?curid=711003" title="Love of Life">
<text>Love of Life is an American soap opera televised on CBS from September 24, 1951, to February 1, 1980. It was created by Roy Winsor, whose previous creation &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; premiered three weeks before &quot;Love of Life&quot;; he created &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; two and a half years later.

==Production==
&quot;Love of Life&quot; was originally taped at Liederkranz Hall on East 58th Street in Manhattan. Mike and Buff (Mike Wallace), Ernie Kovacs, and &quot;Douglas Edwards and the News&quot;, as well as &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; were also recorded from that location. The program originated at other studios in Manhattan, but primarily at the CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street and CBS&#x27; Studio 52 behind the Ed Sullivan Theater. In 1975, the series moved to make way for a nightclub that became known as Studio 54. Until its final episode in 1980, &quot;Love of Life&quot; was taped in Studio 41 at the CBS Broadcast Center.

===Format===
Unlike most other soap operas, &quot;Love of Life&quot; was originally not split up into segments dictated by commercial breaks. Because the show was owned by packaged-goods giant American Home Products and merely licensed to CBS, all commercials were for AH products, and occurred before or after the show. In the 1960s, one commercial break was allotted around the middle of the program, but this was mostly to allow affiliates to reconnect with the feed after airing local commercials. &quot;Love of Life&quot; adopted the &quot;five segments per half-hour&quot; standard in the 1970s.

==Broadcast history==

&quot;Love of Life&quot; began, as most other television serials of that era, as a 15-minute program, airing at 12:15 pm Eastern Time (11:15 am Central). The program became so popular, CBS expanded it to 30 minutes on April 14, 1958, moving it to noon/11:00. During the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Love of Life&quot; generally placed among the top six soaps in the ratings. On October 1, 1962, the program&#x27;s running time was reduced by five minutes to accommodate an abbreviated network newscast.

To accommodate the new in-house serial &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, on September 8, 1969, CBS moved &quot;Love of Life&quot; ahead 30 minutes to 11:30/10:30, restoring it to a full 30-minute runtime. The timeslot change put the series up against the highly popular &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; on NBC, causing &quot;Love of Life&quot;″s audience share dropped from fifth place in the Nielsen daytime ratings during the 1968–1969 season to 11th in the 1969–1970 season. This helped give NBC a major win in 1971 as &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, and the serial &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; all reached the top-five-rated shows among daytime network programs. On March 26, 1973, episodes were again reduced to fit a 25-minute slot to accommodate a newscast. By this time, CBS had assumed production from the original packager, AHP, as it had with &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;.

CBS canceled its in-house soaps &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; and &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; in 1973, and &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; in early 1974. &quot;Love of Life&quot; managed to escape cancellation due to a brief rise in the ratings in the mid-1970s, which was due to Meg&#x27;s return to the storyline. The show&#x27;s ratings climbed as high as ninth, above &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, in the 1975–1976 television season.

On April 23, 1979, CBS moved &quot;Love of Life&quot; to the 4:00/3:00 pm slot that had opened up when the network canceled &quot;Match Game&quot;. Episodes once again were expanded to 30 minutes. However, ratings plummeted following the move; an increasing number of CBS affiliates pre-empted the serial to show more profitable syndicated programming as many ABC affiliates had done to &quot;Love of Life&#x27;s&quot; former CBS sister soap &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which had been airing on ABC for the last four years, also in the 4:00 pm time slot after being cancelled by CBS four years earlier due to the expansion of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to a full hour in December 1975. In September 1979, a new, daily, syndicated version of &quot;Match Game&quot; was introduced; in some markets, the show was aired against or, on CBS stations, in place of &quot;Love of Life&quot;.

Despite CBS moving the show to the 4:00/3:00 timeslot, some affiliates chose to air it at earlier timeslots in pattern with the other soaps. For example, in Indianapolis, then-CBS affiliate WISH-TV aired &quot;Love of Life&quot; at 3:30 (Eastern) while airing &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; reruns at 4:00. Many West Coast stations, such as CBS-owned KNXT (now KCBS-TV) in Los Angeles, did this, as well, keeping &quot;Love of Life&quot; in tandem with the other soaps by airing it at 2:30 Pacific time, after &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Other stations, such as then-O&amp;O KMOX-TV (now KMOV) in St. Louis, kept the show in late morning at 11:00 (Central). Additionally, WDVM-TV (now WUSA) in Washington, DC, chose to keep &quot;Love of Life&quot; at 11:30 while pre-empting &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. In the soap&#x27;s home market of New York City, WCBS-TV aired it at noon.

Within 10 months, CBS realized that the 4:00 slot did not work for &quot;Love of Life&quot; in light of affiliate tape-delays and pre-emptions, and subsequently cancelled the show. Its final episode aired on February 1, 1980; atypical for a soap opera concluding its run, the remaining storylines ended on a cliffhanger, a byproduct of the limited turnaround between the cancellation announcement and the end of production for writers to adequately resolve the plots. The following Monday, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; expanded to an hour, with &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; moving into the 4:00/3:00 timeslot in most markets following &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. According to rumors, once CBS cancelled &quot;Love of Life,&quot; they intended to use the show&#x27;s New York studio space for the 1980 Winter Olympics, which took place later that month in Lake Placid, New York.

Director Larry Auerbach said that he lamented the network&#x27;s 4:00/3:00 slot choice on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; the day &quot;Love of Life&quot; finished airing, feeling that the slot was better suited to airing shows that appealed to kids after school.

==Storyline==

===1951–1960===
The original story was a morality play of good versus evil, illustrated by the interactions between two sisters, Vanessa Dale (originally Peggy McCay) and Meg Dale (originally Jean McBride, from 1951 to 1958). Vanessa (often referred to as &quot;Van&quot; for short) was &quot;the good girl&quot;. She stood up for what was right in life and in her community. Meg was the schemer and all-around &quot;bad&quot; girl, as well as the mother of &quot;Beanie&quot; (later &quot;Ben&quot;) Harper, originally played by Dennis Parnell. While Van disapproved of Meg&#x27;s actions, she still loved her and taught the audience the value of forgiveness which often involved Beanie, and his strained relationship with Meg, his mother. The show was painted black-and-white in this regard, which was evident in the tagline recited at the beginning of each of the earlier episodes: &quot;&quot;Love of Life&quot;: The exciting story of Vanessa Dale and her courageous struggle for human dignity.&quot;

The show changed directions when the character of Meg was phased out and the show changed locales; first set in the fictional town of Barrowsville, it moved to Rosehill, where it remained for the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

The actress who originated the role of Van (Peggy McCay) left the show in 1955, and was replaced by actress Bonnie Bartlett (1955–1959). Bartlett was subsequently replaced by Audrey Peters, who played Van for the rest of the run (1959–1980). Peters had an unusual debut – Bartlett had played the role of Vanessa up to Vanessa&#x27;s wedding day. The next day, when Vanessa walked down the aisle, Bruce Sterling raised Vanessa&#x27;s veil and revealed Audrey Peters. Peters admitted that, during the wedding reception scenes afterward, she did not know the names of all the characters who were interacting with Vanessa, so she called everyone &quot;dear&quot;.

===1960–1973===
In the 1960s, most of the drama was focused on Van and her new marriage to Bruce Sterling (played by Ron Tomme). The late 1960s involved attempts to shake up the somewhat staid atmosphere through campus unrest and a return of Vanessa&#x27;s first husband, who had been killed off in the mid-1950s. Her ex-husband was an amnesiac going by the name of Matt Corby. Vanessa divorced Bruce to reunite with her first husband, outraging many in the audience who could not accept their heroine getting a divorce.

The other major story of the late 1960s involved Tess Krakauer and Bill Prentiss, played by real-life couple Toni Bull Bua and Gene Bua. Tess and Bill had the perfunctory tortured love story, including separations, children, and murder trials, until Bill died of a &quot;rare blood disease&quot; in 1972 and Tess left town in 1973.

===1973–1980===

As ratings began to slide in the 1970s, Meg and her son Ben Harper were reintroduced. Meg was played by Tudi Wiggins from 1974 to 1980. Ben, now an adult, was most notably played by Christopher Reeve from 1974 to 1976 and later recast and played by Chandler Hill Harben from 1976 to 1980. Under the reins of Claire Labine and Paul Avila Mayer, the show returned to the original &quot;good Vanessa, bad Meg&quot; theme. In one episode, Meg called her son&#x27;s newborn daughter Suzanne a &quot;bastard&quot;, one of the first times the word was spoken on daytime television.

After Labine and Mayer left in 1975 to develop the ABC serial &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, the show lost the original intended focus. Emphasis was increased on gritty story lines (for example, Ben, now played by Chandler Hill Harben, was nearly raped while in prison serving time for bigamy), but these were not warmly received by the audience, and the ratings dropped. The show occupied a vulnerable timeslot. Since the beginning, &quot;Love of Life&quot; had aired in the late morning – and few soaps had been successful when airing before noon. The show&#x27;s ratings had been respectable but middling in the 1950s and 1960s, but dropped sharply in the early 1970s. In 1976, Rick Latimer (Jerry Lacy) and his wife Cal (Roxanne Gregory) welcomed a young vet Michael Blake (Richard E. Council) into their garage apartment. Michael&#x27;s secret &quot;crush&quot; on Cal led to a vacation rendezvous and a fatal boating accident resulting from Blake&#x27;s failed attempt to save Cal&#x27;s son (Hank) from a sudden lake squall. Their son survived, but Blake drowned. Rick, Cal, and their son left Rosehill for Montreal to start a new life.

On April 23, 1979, in a last-ditch effort to save &quot;Love of Life&quot;, CBS moved the show to 4:00 pm. Head writers Jean Holloway and Ann Marcus&#x27; stories did not catch on with the audience.

&quot;Love of Life&quot; ended its run with a cliffhanger on February 1, 1980. After testifying in a trial, Betsy Crawford (Margo McKenna) collapsed while leaving the stand. No other networks picked up the show, and the cliffhanger remained unresolved. The final shot of the series was of longtime director Larry Auerbach, portfolio in hand, walking through the empty sets and out the CBS Broadcast Center Studio 41 gate, as Tony Bennett&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together Again&quot; played.

<text>Anne Clare Cools (born August 12, 1943) is a Canadian retired senator and the longest serving member of the Senate of Canada. As a social worker, Cools was a pioneer in the protection of women from domestic violence, running one of the first domestic violence shelters in Canada.

==Personal life and education==
Cools was born and raised in Barbados, as the daughter of pharmacist Lucius Unique Cools and Rosita Gordon Miller Cools, who owned a sugar plantation. Both her grandfather and an uncle were politically active on the island. When she was four years old, two of her siblings died. In Barbados, Cools attended Queen&#x27;s College Girls School. In 1957, when she was 13 years old, her family immigrated to Canada, where she studied at Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee High School in Montreal. Cools received a B.A. degree in social sciences, sociology and psychology from McGill University. Cools is married to business consultant Rolf Calhoun. Her personal interests include classical music, playing the piano, reading, gardening and dogs.

=== Early Career ===
Early in her career, Cools worked as a student coordinator, responsible for supervising students and training them to be social workers. She was employed by the University of Toronto, in the Faculty of Social Work from 1978-1978; by the Ryerson Polytechnic Institute (now Toronto Metropolitan University) from 1978 to 1980. She worked at Seneca College from 1977 to 1989.

== Advocacy ==
=== Racism ===
In February 1969, Cools participated in a 13 day long civil disobedience sit-in at Sir George Williams University (later Concordia University), where over 400 students occupied the computer center to protest the school&#x27;s inadequate handling of complaints of racism against a professor. When the riot-police stormed the building, some floors were set on fire, computers were destroyed and computer cards and paper rained down from the 9th floor onto the street below, where there was a counter-demonstration chanting &quot;let the niggers burn&quot;. While Cools was nowhere near the 9th floor, she was one of 97 students arrested, and unlike most of them, Cools refused to plead guilty to be set free, instead, she served two months in jail. About the affair, she has said &quot;it took me a long time to recover... it shocked me to my core&quot;. In 1981, she was granted the pardon by the National Parole Board of Canada.

===Domestic violence===
As a social worker, Cools was one of the pioneers in the protection of women from domestic abuse. In 1974, Cools moved to Toronto where she founded and served as the executive director for &quot;Women in Transition Inc.&quot;, one of the first shelters for domestic violence victims in Canada. With a high demand for its services, Cools obtained funding for and opened a second shelter in 1987. She co-organized Canada&#x27;s first domestic violence conference, &quot;Couples in Conflict&quot;.

Cools has presented evidence that men and women are equally capable of domestic violence and aggression, which is not a gendered characteristic, but a human pathology of intimacy. In January 2016, in a &quot;Canadaland&quot; audio podcast interview with Desmond Cole, Cools supported and cited the work of the English domestic violence pioneer and expert Erin Pizzey, when she claimed that women are equally violent as men in domestic violence conflicts.

===Child custody===
Cools is a strong advocate for children&#x27;s rights, that they after divorce should have continuing relationships with both mothers and fathers, and the importance of fathers for the children&#x27;s development. In the 1990s, Cools was instrumental in the creation of and served on the Senate/House Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access, which in December 1998 issued its report, &quot;For the Sake of the Children&quot;. A principal recommendation of this report was that following a relationship breakdown, shared parenting should be presumed to be in the best interests of the child. She was candid in her criticism of the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien when proposed legislation to be introduced in the House of Commons was shelved after intense lobbying by women&#x27;s groups.

===Feminism===
While a strong advocate for women and domestic violence victims, she has also criticized certain aspects of the feminist movement, e.g. stating that &quot;this feminism that has grown up suddenly in the last few years, where all virtue and goodness are stacked up on the side of women, and all evil and violence is stacked up on the side of men—well, human nature doesn&#x27;t work that way.&quot; 

===Community Outreach===
In addition to her work as social worker, Cools was actively involved in several community organizations. She was a member of the Board of Directors of the Black Education Project, a volunteer-run organization created to address racial inequalities in Toronto&#x27;s education system. She also served on the board of Black Theatre Canada, the Pauline McGibbon Cultural Centre, and the Social Planning Council of Metropolitan Toronto. 

==Political career==
===National Parole Board===
From 1980 to 1984, Cools served on the National Parole Board of Canada, which is the parole board for federal prisoners.

=== Canadian House of Commons ===
She twice sought election to the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada. She lost the Liberal nomination in a highly contested race against John Evans for the 1978 by-election in Rosedale. Her campaign for the nomination was documented in the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;The Right Candidate for Rosedale&quot;. She ran again in 1979, and won the nomination but was defeated in both the 1979 and 1980 elections by Progressive Conservative candidate David Crombie.

=== Canadian Senate ===
In 1984, Cools was appointed to the Senate of Canada by governor general Edward Schreyer, on the recommendation of prime minister Pierre Trudeau, becoming the first black person in the Canadian senate. She had designated herself as representing the Senate division of Toronto-Centre-York.

Cools became increasingly critical of the Liberal governments of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, and of same-sex marriage. On June 9, 2004, she announced that she was crossing the floor to join the Conservative Party of Canada.

In the fall of 2006, Cools was barred from her committee duties for the Conservative Party, after questioning a new government accountability bill. In 2007, Cools was ousted from the Conservative party group after accusing two fellow senators of having grabbed and assaulted her. She also mentioned that she had witnessed a senator hitting a child. She sat as a non-affiliated Senator from 2007 until 2017 when she joined the Independent Senators Group.

From the retirement of Lowell Murray on September 26, 2011, until her own retirement on August 12, 2018, Cools was the longest-serving member of the Senate. She is the first female black Senator in North America. With the retirement of Charlie Watt, Cools was the last Senator appointed by Pierre Trudeau remaining in the Senate.

<doc id="711012" wikidata="Q249838" url="?curid=711012" title="Vice (magazine)">
<text>Vice (stylized in all caps) is a Canadian-American magazine focused on lifestyle, arts, culture, and news/politics. It was founded in 1994 in Montreal as an alternative punk magazine, and its founders later launched the youth media company Vice Media, which consists of divisions including the printed magazine as well as a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint. As of February 2015, the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief is Ellis Jones.

On 15 May 2023, Vice Media formally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as part of a possible sale to a consortium of lenders including Fortress Investment Group, which will, alongside Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital, invest $225 million as a credit bid for nearly all of its assets. In February 2024, CEO Bruce Dixon announced additional layoffs and that the website Vice.com will no longer publish content. The print magazine returned in September 2024.

==History==
The precursor to &quot;Vice&quot; magazine was founded in October 1994 in Montreal under the name &quot;Voice&quot; (later &quot;Voice of Montreal&quot;), by Interimages Communications. It was a spin-off of the English-language portion of &quot;Images&quot; magazine, a multicultural publication founded in the early 1990s by Dominique Ollivier with Alix Laurent, under the name &quot;Voice of Montreal&quot;. Issue no. 1 lists Laurent and Ollivier as publishers, with Suroosh Y. Alvi as editor and Gavin McInnes as assistant editor, with Shane Smith joining the magazine&#x27;s staff later. The magazine was established under a job creation program of the Quebec government to allow social welfare recipients to gain work experience. It focused on Montreal&#x27;s alternative cultural scene, including music, art, trends and drug culture, to compete with the already established &quot;Montreal Mirror&quot;. During the 1990s, Montreal&#x27;s Plateau Mont-Royal/Mile-End neighbourhood was home to a burgeoning subculture with the advent of collectives such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dummies Theatre, Bran Van 3000 and later Arcade Fire. Alvi, McInnes and Smith bought out the publisher and changed the magazine&#x27;s name to &quot;Vice&quot; in 1996.

Richard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in 1999. Following the relocation, the magazine quickly developed a reputation for provocative and politically incorrect content. Under Szalwinski&#x27;s ownership, a few retail stores were opened in New York City and customers could purchase fashion items that were advertised in the magazine. However, due to the end of the dot-com bubble, the three founders eventually regained ownership of the &quot;Vice&quot; brand, followed by closure of the stores.

The British edition of &quot;Vice&quot; was launched in 2002 and Andy Capper was its first editor. Capper explained in an interview shortly after the UK debut that the publication&#x27;s remit was to cover &quot;the things we&#x27;re meant to be ashamed of&quot;, and articles were published on topics such as bukkake and bodily functions.

By the end of 2007, 13 foreign editions of &quot;Vice&quot; magazine were published, the Vice independent record label was functional, and the online video channel VBS.com had 184,000 unique viewers from the U.S. during the month of August. The media company was still based in New York City, but the magazine began featuring articles on topics that were considered more serious, such as armed conflict in Iraq, than previous content. Alvi explained to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in November 2007: &quot;The world is much bigger than the Lower East Side and the East Village.&quot;

McInnes left the publication in 2008, citing &quot;creative differences&quot; as the primary issue. In an email communication dated 23 January, McInnes explained: &quot;I no longer have anything to do with &quot;Vice&quot; or VBS or DOs &amp; DON&#x27;Ts or any of that. It&#x27;s a long story but we&#x27;ve all agreed to leave it at &#x27;creative differences,&#x27; so please don&#x27;t ask me about it.&quot;

At the commencement of 2012, an article in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine referred to the Vice company as &quot;Vice Media&quot;, but the precise time when this title development occurred is not public knowledge. &quot;Vice&quot; acquired the fashion magazine &quot;i-D&quot; in December 2012 and, by February 2013, &quot;Vice&quot; produced 24 global editions of the magazine, with a global circulation of 1,147,000 (100,000 in the UK). By this stage, Alex Miller had replaced Capper as the editor-in-chief of the UK edition. Furthermore, &quot;Vice&quot; consisted of 800 worldwide employees, including 100 in London, and around 3,500 freelancers also produced content for the company.

In February 2015, Vice Media named Ellis Jones editor-in-chief of &quot;Vice&quot; magazine and former UK editor-in-chief, Alex Miller, was appointed to the position of global head of content. 

In 2018, the magazine switched to a quarterly publication schedule, though issues still generally explored a single theme. The publication was put on hiatus in 2019.

In 2023, &quot;Vice&quot; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company&#x27;s lenders—Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital—agreed to purchase the company for $225 million. In February 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; highlighted that &quot;over the past half-decade, &quot;Vice&quot; has had near annual layoffs and mounting losses, and has filed for bankruptcy, making it the poster child for the battered digital-media industry&quot; and that while &quot;some observers hoped its new owners [...] would reinvest&quot; in the company, Fortress Investment Group has instead &quot;decided to make sweeping cuts&quot;.

In September 2024, Vice Media relaunched its print magazine and will publish issues quarterly. The company has a goal of reaching 20,000 subscribers within a year.

==Content==
===Scope===
&quot;Vice&quot; magazine includes the work of journalists, columnists, fiction writers, graphic artists and cartoonists, and photographers. Both &quot;Vice&quot;″s online and magazine content has shifted from dealing mostly with independent arts and pop cultural matters to covering more serious news topics. Due to the large array of contributors and the fact that often writers will only submit a small number of articles with the publication, &quot;Vice&quot;″s content varies dramatically and its political and cultural stance is often unclear or contradictory. Articles on the site feature a range of subjects, often things not covered as by mainstream media. The magazine&#x27;s editors have championed the immersionist school of journalism, which has been passed to other properties of Vice Media such as the documentary television show &quot;Balls Deep&quot; on the Viceland Channel. This style of journalism is regarded as something of a DIY antithesis to the methods practiced by mainstream news outlets, and has published an entire issue of articles written in accordance with this ethos. Entire issues of the magazine have also been dedicated to the concerns of Iraqi people, Native Americans, Russian people, people with mental disorders, and people with mental disabilities. &quot;Vice&quot; also publishes an annual guide for students in the United Kingdom.

In 2007, a &quot;Vice&quot; announcement was published on the Internet: After umpteen years of putting out what amounted to a reference book every month, we started to get bored with it. Besides, too many other magazines have ripped it and started doing their own lame take on themes. So we&#x27;re going to do some issues, starting now, that have whatever we feel like putting in them.

===Politics===
In a March 2008 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Smith was asked about the magazine&#x27;s political allegiances and he stated, &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left/right way… We don&#x27;t do that because we don&#x27;t believe in either side. Are my politics Democrat or Republican? I think both are horrific. And it doesn&#x27;t matter anyway. Money runs America; money runs everywhere.&quot;

===Website===

&quot;Vice&quot; founded its website as Viceland.com in 1996, as Vice.com was already owned. In 2007, it started VBS.tv as a domain, which prioritized videos over print, and had a number of shows for free such as &quot;The Vice Guide to Travel&quot;. In 2011, Viceland.com and VBS.tv were combined into Vice.com, also the host of the Vice Motherboard website at motherboard.vice.com.

In 2012, Vice Media was created as the parent company for &quot;Vice&quot; magazine and other properties including Vice News on HBO and the Vice.com website. The company has since expanded and diversified to include a network of online channels, including Munchies.tv, Motherboard.tv, Noisey.com, Thu.mp, and Broadly.

On 22 February 2024, Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon announced &quot;several hundred&quot; additional layoffs as the company restructures, and that the website Vice.com would no longer publish content. Some of its journalists have since spun off, such as 404 Media being a spiritual successor of the tech division &quot;Motherboard&quot; founded by its key people.

=== Book ===
* In 2007, &quot;Vice&quot; published &quot;The Vice Photo Book&quot; (), with a collection of photos of Jaimie Warren, Jerry Hsu, Michael Rababy and Patrick O’Dell. The book is divided in five parts: &quot;Vice Photographers&quot;, &quot;Vice&#x27;s Photojournalism&quot;, &quot;Vice Fashion&quot;, and the final two sections are a collage of previously published &quot;VICE&quot; photos. The book also contains interviews with some of the photographers.
* Jill Abramson: &quot;Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts.&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, New York 2019, (), S. 42–61, 147–181, 346–369 (= &quot;Chapter 2&quot;, &quot;6&quot; and &quot;11&quot;).

==Reputation==
From its beginnings as &quot;Voice of Montreal&quot;, &quot;Vice&quot; had a &quot;reputation for provocation&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Vice&quot; was described as &quot;gonzo journalism for the YouTube generation&quot;. As the magazine grew into a broader media brand, it struggled with &quot;how to distance itself from its crude past, yet hold on to enough of that reputation to cement, and grow, its authority with its core audience&quot;. Nevertheless, the magazine has continued to face controversy. In 2013, the magazine retracted parts of a fashion spread entitled &#x27;Last Words&#x27; which depicted &quot;female writers killing themselves&quot;. Also in 2013, &quot;Vice&quot; again gained unwelcome attention when the then-editor of the magazine joined millionaire software mogul John McAfee as he evaded authorities to avoid being questioned about a murder case.

===Sexual harassment at parent company===

In the late 2017, multiple stories were published citing allegations of sexual misconduct and a general &quot;boys club&quot; culture at &quot;Vice&quot; magazine&#x27;s parent company, Vice Media.

<doc id="711013" wikidata="Q17386109" url="?curid=711013" title="Jean-Serge Brisson">
<text>Jean-Serge Brisson (born June 28, 1954) is a Canadian political activist, tax reform advocate, politician, and author. He is a former leader of the Libertarian Party of Canada and gained national notoriety in the 1990s for his opposition to businesses being forced to collect the provincial sales tax (PST) without being remunerated.

==Early life==
Brisson was born in Embrun, Ontario, a small village to the east of Ottawa and raised on a dairy farm. He describes his early experiences with jobs and bosses to have put him off from ever being able to work for a boss, wanting to instead start his own business and be his own boss. He first apprenticed as a radiator technician and, in 1974, opened his own company in Embrun, Independent Radiator Co.

==Political life==

===Libertarian candidate===
Brisson has been a candidate for the Libertarian Party of Canada and the Libertarian Party of Ontario in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and Ottawa South. He has never been elected provincially or federally.

In 2004, despite being the leader of the Libertarian Party, Brisson did not run in the federal election due to his recent election to municipal council in Russell, Ontario.

===Leader of the Libertarian Party of Canada===
Brisson was elected as the leader of the party in 1999 and served until May 18, 2008. Brisson credits himself with organizing the party to be able to re-register itself as an official party with Elections Canada and for running more candidates.

===City Councillor===
Following three unsuccessful attempts (including a narrow miss in 2000), Brisson was elected to the municipal council of Russell Township in November 2003 with 1,639 votes. As Councillor he opposed municipal legislation requiring all employees of local government to be proficient in both French and English. He was defeated in his bid for re-election on November 13, 2006 in the 2006 municipal election.

In the 2010 municipal election on October 25, 2010, he unsuccessfully sought election to city council again. With 1,045 votes, he placed ninth out of the nine candidates seeking the four council sets.

===Opposition to PST collection===
In the early 1990s, Brisson refused to continue collecting the Provincial Sales Tax (PST) putting forward the idea to the then New Democratic Party of Bob Rae, that collection of any money by small business for any government is slavery. Also the Progressive Conservatives of Brian Mulroney introduced the Goods and Sales Tax (GST) in Canada to replace the manufacturing sales tax. Brisson argues that customers should be sending in their taxes to the Ontario government themselves, the Ontario government mandated that all businesses charge the sales tax when a customer was purchasing a good or service since 1961, then send that money to the government. Brisson said he never agreed to be hired as a tax collector for the provincial government, but if he was going to be doing their work, he expected to be paid the same as other provincial tax collectors, which at the time Brisson&#x27;s shop rate was approximately $30 per hour. However, the government would not pay businesses for the added responsibilities to the business, which Brisson argued was a form of slavery. Brisson documented his experience in his book titled &quot;Tea Party of One: All Governments Invited&quot;. In 1994, Brisson claims to have ceased filing income takes returns.

<text>&#x27; (also spelled &#x27;; ) is a Māori language term that is used in a similar way to LGBT. When speaking Māori, LGBT people of any culture are referred to as . In English, a person is a Māori individual who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT).

Traditionally, referred to a devoted partner of the same sex. In contemporary use, is used in response to the Western construction of &quot;sexuality, gender, and corresponding identity expressions&quot; (gender identity and sexual identity). Māori gender identifiers (, ) and gender roles protocols, participation in warfare, delineated male and female modes of dress and placement of existed prior to and outside of Western influence. The term encompasses not only aspects of sexuality but also cultural identity. incorporates both a sense of indigenous identity and communicates sexual orientation; it has become an umbrella term to build solidarity among sexuality and gender minorities within Māori communities.

 is not a new term, but the application of it is recent. The &quot;Dictionary of the Māori Language&quot;—first compiled by missionary Herbert Williams in 1832—notes the definition as &quot;intimate companion of the same sex&quot;. After a long period of disuse there has been a resurgence since the 1980s for a label to describe an individual who is both Māori and non-heterosexual. The word was found to have existed in pre-colonial New Zealand to describe relationships between people of the same sex. The existence of this word refutes the conservative Māori argument that homosexuality did not exist in Māori society prior to the arrival of Europeans.

==Hinemoa and Tūtānekai==
The classic and earliest full account of the origins of gods and the first human beings is contained in a manuscript entitled &quot;Nga Tama a Rangi&quot; (&quot;The Sons of Heaven&quot;), written in 1849 by Te Rangikāheke, of the Ngāti Rangiwewehi tribe of Rotorua. The manuscript &quot;gives a clear and systematic account of Māori religious beliefs and beliefs about the origin of many natural phenomena, the creation of woman, the origin of death, and the fishing up of lands. No other version of this myth is presented in such a connected and systematic way, but all early accounts, from whatever area or tribe, confirm the general validity of the Rangikāheke version. It begins as follows: &#x27;My friends, listen to me. The Māori people stem from only one source, namely the Great-heaven-which-stands-above, and the Earth-which-lies-below. According to Europeans, God made heaven and earth and all things. According to the Māori, Heaven (Rangi) and Earth (Papa) are themselves the source&#x27;&quot; (Biggs 1966:448).

One of the great love stories of the Māori world is the legend of Hinemoa and Tūtānekai. The story remains popular and is retold in songs, films, cultural theatre and dance. Hinemoa defies her family to claim Tūtānekai, her &quot;heart&#x27;s desire&quot;—the love-child of a chief&#x27;s wife who was not her social equal. In reading Te Rangikāheke&#x27;s original version in Māori, Ngahuia Te Awekotuku found that Tūtānekai had a male friend, , named Tiki, and Tūtānekai was &quot;nowhere near as impressed by Hinemoa as the romantic Victorian narrative had construed&quot;. After Tūtānekai became united with Hinemoa, Tiki famously grieved for the loss of his . Tūtānekai, feeling grieved as well, arranged that his younger sister marry Tiki to console him. While no-one can say Tūtānekai and Tiki were sexually involved, their relationship was accepted to be intimate beyond mere friendship, and the story illustrates the concept that in traditional Māori life was not exactly the same as constructions of contemporary homosexuality in Western societies.

==Uses==
One of the first contemporary uses of was in a report to the Public Health Commission by Herewini and Sheridan (1994), which used the term to encompass Māori gay men as well as men who have sex with men but who do not identify as gay. The historical usage of the term might not correspond with contemporary understanding of LGBT identities, while information on non-heterosexual sexuality and variations from gender roles as we understand them today has been substantially eradicated by Victorian morality brought by colonisers and Christian missionaries. Although circumstantial, there remains some evidence that lived without discrimination in pre-European times. Some contemporary Māori LGBT people use the terms &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; as a convenience, while others self-identify as to resist the colonisation of their identities and bodies which would &quot;deny access to important ancestral knowledge&quot;. Some use both terms depending on the context. Using to self-identify requires acceptance of oneself as Māori as well as being LGBT. About one fifth of Māori are young people, but the state education system does not explicitly provide for exploring multiple identities. The traditional spiritual and social roles that have played in historical Māori societies are not easily incorporated into teaching plans and despite a 2002 mandate from the Ministry of Education, there remains a &quot;wholesale absence of culturally appropriate sexuality curriculum in schools for the Māori.&quot;

Derivatives of include for bisexual, for lesbian and or for trans men or trans women. serves as an umbrella term for all these identities.

<doc id="711034" wikidata="Q4689569" url="?curid=711034" title="Africa Inland Mission">
<text>Established in 1895, Africa Inland Mission (AIM) is a Christian mission sending agency focused on Africa. Their stated mission is to see &quot;Christ-centered churches established among all African peoples.&quot; AIM established the Kapsowar Hospital in 1933. It developed into the Africa Inland Church (AIC), based in Kenya.

==History of AIM==
Africa Inland Mission had its beginning in the work of Peter Cameron Scott (1867–1896), a Scottish-American missionary who served two years in the Congo before being forced to seek medical care in Britain in 1892 because of a near-fatal illness. While recuperating, he developed his idea of establishing a network of mission stations which would stretch from the southeast coast of Africa to the interior&#x27;s Lake Chad. He was unable to interest any churches in the idea (including his own), but managed to captivate several friends in Philadelphia. In 1895 they formed the Philadelphia Missionary Council.

===Beginnings===

More important than specialized training, AIM found acceptance among tribal people based on Christian commitment and moral standing. The council was headed by Rev. Charles Hurlburt, president of the Pennsylvania Bible Institute, the organisation which provided most of the mission&#x27;s workers in its very early years.

===First mission party===
On August 17, 1895, AIM&#x27;s first mission party set off. The group consisted of Scott, his sister Margaret, and six others. They arrived off the east African coast in October, and in little over a year they established a network of mission stations which would eventually stretch from the southeast coast of the continent to the interior&#x27;s Lake Chad.

The mission had four stations — at Nzaui, Sakai (Kenya), Kilungu, and Kangundo, Manyatta, all in Kenya. Additional workers arrived from Canada and the United States and the small group expanded to fifteen.
===Scott&#x27;s death===

In December 1896, Peter Scott died of blackwater fever. The mission almost disbanded the following year when most of the workers either died or resigned. The council began to take more responsibility for the work and appointed Hurlburt director of the mission. He and his family moved to Africa and for the next two decades he provided strong, if not undisputed, leadership for the headquarters, established in 1903 at Kijabe, Kenya.

===Ministry expansion===
After Kijabe, AIM expanded to Mataara (1908), Kinyona (1911), and a dispensary (today a hospital) in Kapsowar (1933). Of the Kikuyu who showed interest in the mission and its activities, many were from what would be considered the bottom rungs of society, lacking property and power, including &quot;ahoi&quot; (landless tenants) and people who were neither &quot;mbari&quot; nor &quot;riika&quot; leaders and unlikely to be so in future. The AIM provided such people with an alternative route to power and status, just as others were being closed off, offered a refuge for some from the egregious aspects of domination by colonial chiefs and their colonial masters, and also furnished an opportunity for what some regarded as a more satisfying spiritual life within the Christian faith.

From Kenya, the mission expanded its work to neighboring countries. In 1909, a station was set up in what was then German East Africa and later became Tanzania. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt pulled some strings, persuading the Belgian government to permit a mission station in colonial Congo. Work began in Uganda in 1918; in French Equatorial Africa (Central African Republic) in 1924; Sudan in 1949; and the islands of the Indian Ocean in 1975. Besides evangelism, workers of the mission ran clinics, hospitals, schools, publishing operations, and radio programs. The Rift Valley Academy was built at Kijabe for missionary children. Scott Theological College in Kenya helped train African church leaders. The churches founded by the mission in each of its fields were eventually organised into branches of the independent Africa Inland Church which continues to work closely with the mission today.

===AIM&#x27;s goals===

Africa Inland Mission&#x27;s stated mission is see &quot;Christ centered Churches established among all African peoples.&quot; Their goal is to introduce Jesus Christ to those who have never heard of him. AIM seeks to help new believers grow strong and healthy in their faith and to see new believers enfolded into a maturing church. The organization aims to invest in the lives of current and future church leaders so they can effectively affect the lives of others who can in turn reach out to the vast population of Africa and beyond. The Mission Handbook gives AIM&#x27;s goal &quot;to plant maturing churches...through the evangelization of unreached people groups and the effective preparation of church leaders.&quot;

<text>Tocumwal ( ) is a town in the southern Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia, in the Berrigan Shire local government area. The town, north of the city of Melbourne, lies on the northern bank of the Murray River, which forms the border with Victoria.

The Newell Highway and Murray Valley Highway join at the Murray River, and form part of the main road route National Highway between Brisbane and Melbourne. At the , Tocumwal had a population of 2,682.

The name of the town is probably a corruption of the local Pangerang indigenous word, &quot;Tucumiva&quot; (or &quot;Tucumival&quot;), meaning &quot;deep hole&quot;. Near Tocumwal is a 25-metre-deep hole in granite rock, now known as &quot;The Blowhole&quot;, which is linked underground to the nearby Murray River.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the Tocumwal area was inhabited by the Ulupna and Bangerang people. The first pastoral runs were established in the 1840s. The town was established in the early 1860s and gazetted in 1862 as:

&quot;a Village to be called TOCUMWAL ... Situated on the Murray River, on the road from Albury to Deniliquin, about 50 miles west of Corowa, and 40 south-east of Deniliquin.&quot;

Tocumwal Post Office opened on 1 August 1868.

Prior to Federation, Tocumwal was an important customs point for goods moving between the then British colonies of Victoria and New South Wales.

A standard gauge branch line, from the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) Main Southern railway line at Junee, reached Narrandera in 1881 and a branch from Narrandera was completed to Tocumwal in 1898. The broad gauge Victorian Railways Melbourne-Shepparton railway line was extended to Tocumwal in 1908, creating a break-of-gauge location at Tocumwal, but the NSWGR line from Finley to Tocumwal was closed in 1987.

During World War II the town was the site of Royal Australian Air Force Station Tocumwal, which was a major Royal Australian Air Force training airfield and aircraft depot. Units included (at various times) the 5 Operational Training Unit, 7 Operational Training Unit, 7 Aircraft Depot and the Paratroop Training Unit. Today, the airfield is a renowned gliding site.

Also during the War, Tocumwal was the location of RAAF No.14 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 14 June 1944. Usually consisting of four tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000). 

After the War ended, families were housed at the American Air Force Hospital and the men travelled daily over the river to Yarroweyah, in Victoria, to work on farms, which they could then apply for under the soldier settlement scheme. The hospital was on or next to Barooga Station. Living quarters were in long Nissen huts, with three or four families in each and a shared bathroom. Single quarters were at the front and a cook was employed.

Also after the War, about 200 Air Force houses in Tocumwal were disassembled and trucked to Canberra to be reused in as government housing for workers from Melbourne and Sydney who were constructing the new capital city. Called Tocumwal houses, they remain a distinctive architectural feature in Canberra&#x27;s suburbs, such as O&#x27;Connor and Ainslie.

<text>The Esperante is a sports car made by Panoz, an American car manufacturer.

==First generation==
First shown at the 2000 New York Motor Show, the Esperante followed up on the company&#x27;s first model, the minimal Roadster. The company designed the Esperante to be easy to manufacture, with the chassis designed in five modules making extensive use of extruded aluminum. There was no welding involved, pieces were bonded and bolted together instead. Panoz also took advantage of the numerous aviation craftsmen located in and around Atlanta, for design and manufacture as well.

There have been several versions of the original Esperante: the original base model (later given the GT moniker), the GTLM coupe, the GTS, the JRD (an aftermarket upgrade brand similar to Roush Mustangs), and the Brabham. Each model has different specifications. The GTLM, for example, uses a supercharger to boost power from to , raising performance from 0–60 mph in 5 seconds to 4 seconds. The GTS on the other hand is built as a drivers&#x27; class spec car, to SCCA standards, with harness, roll cage, side bars, etc. Additionally, it is around lighter than the base Esperante, has a steel 5.8 liter V8 racing engine that produces , and is made of easily replaceable panels to facilitate small impact race repair. It can do 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.2 seconds, go up to a top speed of , and achieve 0.98 g of lateral grip.

Panoz&#x27; engines for the first generation were sourced from Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Modular V8 family.

==Racing (Panoz Esperante GTLM)==
A racing version of the Esperante known as the Esperante GT-LM was developed by Panoz for the GT2 category of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. 2006 was a year of noticeable achievement for Panoz.

The #50 Multimatic Motorsports Team Panoz Esperante GT-LM took a first place podium finish at the 55th Annual Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring beating GT2 regulars BMW, Porsche, Ferrari, and Spyker.

That June the #81 Panoz Esperante GT-LM campaigned by England-based Team LNT managed to outlast and overtake the remaining LMGT2 contenders in the final hour of the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans.

In Europe, Team LNT will be campaigning two Esperantes also. They will be competing in the British GT Championship and Le Mans Endurance Series. Team LNT will be returning to the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2007 with both the #81 and #82 cars.

During the 2007 American Le Mans season the Panoz Esperante GTLM will be managed, stateside, by Tom Milner and Team PTG. They will be campaigning two GT-LMs (#20 and #21). Team PTG scored 1 GT2 class podium in the hands of Bill Auberlen and Joey Hand in 2007 Sports Car Challenge of St. Petersburg.
