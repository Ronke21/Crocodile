<text>Spoken and written Vietnamese today uses the Latin script-based Vietnamese alphabet to represent native Vietnamese words (&quot;thuần Việt&quot;), Vietnamese words which are of Chinese origin (&quot;Hán-Việt&quot;, or Sino-Vietnamese), and other foreign loanwords. Historically, Vietnamese literature was written by scholars using a combination of Chinese characters (&quot;Hán&quot;) and original Vietnamese characters (&quot;Nôm&quot;). From 111 BC up to the 20th century, Vietnamese literature was written in Văn ngôn (Classical Chinese) using &quot;chữ Hán&quot; (Chinese characters), and then also Nôm (Chinese and original Vietnamese characters adapted for vernacular Vietnamese) from the 13th century to 20th century. 

&quot;Chữ Hán&quot; were introduced to Vietnam during the thousand year period of Chinese rule from 111 BC to 939 AD. Texts in Vietnam were written using chữ Hán by the 10th century at the latest. Chữ Hán continued to be used as the official administrative script until the 19th century with the exception of two brief periods under the Hồ (1400–1407) and Tây Sơn (1778–1802) dynasties when chữ Nôm was promoted. &quot;Chữ Nôm&quot; is a blend of chữ Hán and unique Vietnamese characters to write the Vietnamese language. It may have been used as early as the 8th century but concrete textual evidence dates to the 13th century. Chữ Nôm never supplanted chữ Hán as the primary writing system and less than five percent of the Vietnamese population used it, primarily as a learning aid for chữ Hán and writing folk literature. Due to its unofficial nature, chữ Nôm was used as a medium for social protest, leading to several bans during the Lê dynasty (1428–1789). In spite of this, a sizable body of literature in chữ Nôm had accumulated by the 19th century, and these texts could be orally disseminated by individuals in villages. 

The two concurrent scripts existed until the era of French Indochina when &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, the Latin alphabet, gradually became the current written medium of literature. In the past, Sanskrit and Indic texts also contributed to Vietnamese literature either from religious ideas from Mahayana Buddhism, or from historical influence of Champa and Khmer.

==Terminology==
In Vietnamese, Chinese characters go by several names, but all refer to the same script:

* &quot;Chữ Hán&quot; (𡨸漢) or &quot;Hán tự&quot; (漢字): &quot;words of Hán&quot; or &quot;Hán characters/words&quot;. 漢字 is also pronounced as Hanzi in Standard Chinese, Hanja in Korean, and Kanji in Japanese. 
* &quot;Hán văn&quot; (漢文): &quot;Han writing&quot; or &quot;Han literature&quot;, also pronounced as &quot;Hanwen&quot; in Standard Chinese, &quot;Hanmun&quot; in Korean, and &quot;Kanbun&quot; in Japanese. Meaning Classical Chinese.
* &quot;Chữ Nho&quot; (𡨸儒, &quot;words of Confucians&quot;).

The Vietnamese word &quot;chữ&quot; (character, script, writing, letter) is derived from a Middle Chinese pronunciation of (Modern Mandarin Chinese in Pinyin: zì), meaning &#x27;character&#x27;.

&quot;Từ Hán Việt&quot; (詞漢越, &quot;Sino-Vietnamese words&quot;) refers to cognates or terms borrowed from Chinese into the Vietnamese language, usually preserving the phonology of the original Chinese that was introduced to Vietnamese. As for syntax and vocabulary this Sino-Vietnamese language was no more different from the Chinese of Beijing than medieval English Latin was different from the Latin of Rome. Its major influence comes from Vietnamese Literary Chinese (&quot;Chữ Hán&quot;).

The term &quot;chữ Nôm&quot; (𡨸喃, &quot;Southern characters&quot;) refers to the former transcription system for vernacular Vietnamese-language texts, written using a mixture of original Chinese characters and locally coined Nôm characters not found in Chinese to phonetically represent local Vietnamese words, meanings and their sound. However, the character set for &quot;chữ Nôm&quot; is extensive, containing up to 37,000 characters, and many are both arbitrary in composition and inconsistent in pronunciation.

&quot;Hán Nôm&quot; (漢喃, &quot;&quot;Hán&quot; and &quot;chữ Nôm&quot; characters&quot;) may mean both &quot;Hán&quot; and &quot;Nôm&quot; taken together as in the research remit of Hanoi&#x27;s &quot;Hán-Nôm Institute&quot;, or refer to texts which are written in a mixture of Hán and Nôm, or some Hán texts with parallel Nôm translations. There is a significant orthographic overlap between Hán and Nôm and many characters are used in both Hán and Nôm with the same reading. It may be simplest to think of Nôm as the Vietnamese extension of Han characters. 

The term &quot;chữ quốc ngữ&quot; (𡨸國語, &quot;national language script&quot;) means Vietnamese written in the Latin alphabet.

== History ==
===General history===

&quot;Chữ Hán&quot; (Chinese characters), also known as &quot;chữ nho&quot; (Confucian script), were introduced to Vietnam during the thousand year period of Chinese rule from 111 BC to 939 AD. Although the earliest extant texts written in chữ Hán appeared in Vietnam by the 10th century, chữ Hán was the only known writing system in Vietnam at the time, and had likely been used in prior times. Chữ Hán continued to be used in Vietnam after the end of Chinese rule in the 10th century and was instated as the official court script in 1010 and 1174. The Confucian examination system in Vietnam was written in chữ Hán. It remained the official writing system of Vietnam until the 19th century with the exception of two brief periods under the Hồ (1400–1407) and Tây Sơn (1778–1802) dynasties when chữ Nôm gained ascendance.

Chữ Nôm is the adaptation of chữ Hán and creation of unique Vietnamese characters to transcribe the Vietnamese language based on approximations of Middle Chinese pronunciations. It is speculated that chữ Nôm appeared as early as the 8th century using chữ Hán to record elements of the Vietnamese language, however the earliest extant textual evidence of chữ Nôm dates to the 13th century. Chữ Nôm includes thousands of characters unique to Vietnamese not found in Chinese. Due to social circumstances and linguistic inefficiencies, chữ Nôm never replaced chữ Hán as the primary writing system in Vietnam and was only promoted during the short-lived Hồ (1400–1407) and Tây Sơn (1778–1802) dynasties. Less than five percent of the Vietnamese population used chữ Nôm and only did so as a learning aid for chữ Hán or writing folk literature. As a result of its marginalized nature and lack of institutional backing, chữ Nôm was used as a medium for social protest during the Lê dynasty (1428–1789), leading to its ban in 1663, 1718, and 1760. Gia Long, founder of the Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945), supported chữ Nôm until he became emperor and immediately reverted to chữ Hán. Despite its limited usage, a sizable body of literature in chữ Nôm had accumulated by the 19th century, and served as a written medium for oral dissemination by individuals in villages. 

The two concurrent scripts existed until the era of French Indochina when &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, the Latin alphabet, gradually became the current written medium of literature. In the past, Sanskrit and Indic texts also contributed to Vietnamese literature either from religious ideas from Mahayana Buddhism, or from historical influence of Champa and Khmer.

===Pre-writing===
During ancient times, the ancestors of the Vietnamese were considered to have been Proto-Austroasiatic (also called &quot;Proto-Mon–Khmer&quot;) speaking people, possibly traced to the ancient Dong Son culture. Modern linguists describe Vietnamese as having lost some Proto-Austroasiatic phonological and morphological features that the original Vietnamese language had. This was noted in the linguistic separation of Vietnamese from Vietnamese-Muong roughly one thousand years ago. 

===Chữ Hán===

Chinese characters are specifically called (), () or (, ) in Vietnamese. or is commonly used to describe Mandarin Chinese, as well as for Chinese in general. Possibly even a thousand years earlier, in the late first millennium BC, Yuè elites in what is now southern China may have already adopted a form of writing based on Chinese characters to record terms from their own languages. During the Chinese rule from 111 BC to 905 AD, Chinese characters had been used as the official writing of the region. Local texts written in Chinese probably also included some characters adapted to represent Proto-Viet-Mường sounds, usually personal names or Vietic toponyms that had no Chinese equivalent. According to some scholars, the adoption chữ Hán or Hán tự had been started by Shi Xie (137–226), but many disagree. 

The oldest extant poem in chữ Hán written by somebody from Vietnam was authored in 815 by Liêu Hữu Phương. Liêu had made the journey to the Tang dynasty capital of Chang&#x27;an to take the civil service examinations and failed, which he recounted in his poem. He passed the examination in the following year and received an official appointment. The poem is preserved in the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot;. By the time Vietnam became independent in 938, it is apparent that chữ Hán had become the official writing system of Vietnam without any consideration that it was a Chinese language. The &quot;Nam quốc sơn hà&quot;, a patriotic Vietnamese poem attributed to the Vietnamese general Lý Thường Kiệt (1019–1105), was said to have been read aloud as inspiration to Vietnamese troops before they fought victoriously against Chinese troops during the Song–Đại Việt war. The poem was written in Literary Chinese. It is unknown when exactly knowledge of Chinese texts became widespread in Vietnam, but a Song dynasty envoy who reached Vietnam in 987 recounts that a local monk was able to sing the last couplet of a poem written by Tang poet Luo Binwang (ca. 619–684?).

These writings were at first indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in China, Korea or Japan. These include the first poems in Literary Chinese by the monk (), the (), and many Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist scriptures. Even after the invention of chữ Nôm, the adaptation of chữ Hán to write vernacular Vietnamese, educated men were still expected to have a good understanding of chữ Hán and to be able to compose poetry in it. Nguyễn Trãi (1380–1442) composed poetry in both writing systems. This familiarity with poetry in chữ Hán enabled Vietnamese envoys to communicate with envoys from as far away as Korea.

 became the official writing script of the court in 1010 and 1174. It was mainly used by the administration and literati. It continued to serve this role until the mid-19th century during French colonial rule when the traditional writing system was abolished in favour of transliterated .

==== Sino-Vietnamese readings of ====

In Vietnam, texts were read with the vocalization of Chinese text, called (), similar to Chinese on-yomi in Japanese (), or the assimilated vocalizations in Korean (/). This occurred alongside the diffusion of Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary into vernacular Vietnamese, and created a Sinoxenic dialect. The Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank was one of the first linguists to actively employ &quot;Sino-Vietnamese&quot; to recover earlier histories of China.

=== Chữ Nôm ===
From the 13th century, the dominance of Chinese characters began to be challenged by &quot;chữ Nôm&quot;, a different writing system based on the Chinese script to transcribe native Vietnamese words. These were even more difficult than Chinese characters themselves. Nôm script borrowed Chinese characters in their phonetic and semantic values to create new characters. Whilst designed for native Vietnamese words, Nôm required the user to have a fair knowledge of chữ Hán, and thus Nôm was used primarily for literary writings by cultural elites (such as the poetry of Nguyễn Du and Hồ Xuân Hương), while almost all other official writings and documents continued to be written in classical Chinese until the 20th century.

While chữ Nôm had emerged by the 13th century, very few extant vernacular texts in Nôm predate the 15th century, and even later many texts in Nôm were translations or rewritings of works in chữ Hán. During the 15th and 16th centuries, reformist governments translated Chinese Classics into Nôm, but these translations have not survived due to being seen as subversive by successive governments. The Tây Sơn dynasty (1778–1802) mandated the use of Nôm in both government business and civil service examinations but their policy was reverted after the dynasty&#x27;s collapse. In contrast, Minh Mạng (r. 1820–1841), the second emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945), prohibited the use of Nôm in both areas.

Poetry in Nôm was pioneered by Nguyễn Trãi (1380–1442). He wrote Vietnamese poetry in Nôm using the Chinese seven-syllable pattern. Later in the 17th century, Vietnamese poetry shifted towards a native pattern of alternating lines in six and eight syllables. The epic poem, &quot;The Tale of Kieu&quot; by Nguyễn Du (1765–1820), was written in Nôm.

While Nôm never replaced chữ Hán as the primary writing system, a growing number of Buddhist, Confucian, and moral texts had added vernacular explanations in Nôm by the 17th century. Some 19th century editions of Chinese classics also included translations in Nôm, later editions of Chinese fiction started including notes or translations in Nôm, while medical writers had to use Nôm to describe local plants not found in China.

As a result of its marginalized nature and lack of institutional backing, chữ Nôm was used as a medium for social protest during the Lê dynasty (1428–1789), leading to its ban in 1663, 1718, and 1760. Gia Long (r. 1802–1820), founder of the Nguyễn dynasty, supported chữ Nôm until he became emperor and immediately reverted to chữ Hán. Despite its limited usage, a sizable body of literature in chữ Nôm had accumulated by the 19th century, and served as a written medium for oral dissemination by individuals in villages.

=== Quốc âm tân tự ===
&quot;Quốc âm tân tự&quot; (chữ Hán: 國音新字), literally &#x27;new script of national sound (language)&#x27;, was a writing system for Vietnamese proposed in the mid-19th century. Two documents written on this type of script (four pages each) are kept at the Institute for the Study of Hán-Nôm: An older unnamed manuscript, and a more recent copy called Quốc âm tân tự (國音新字). There is no information in the text of the Quốc âm tân tự that indicates the specific date and year this work was written. Based on the fact that in the preface of the work the last stroke of the character &quot;華&quot; (Hoa) has been omitted due to naming taboo, it can be guessed that this text was written during the reign of Emperor Thiệu Trị (whose mother&#x27;s name was &quot;Hồ Thị Hoa&quot; 胡氏華). At the end of the text&#x27;s preface, there is a line &quot;五星聚斗南城居士阮子書&quot; (Ngũ Tinh Tụ Đẩu Nam thành cư sĩ Nguyễn tử thư). Through this inscription, it can be known that the author of Quốc âm tân tự is a layman with the surname Nguyễn (阮) in Nam Định citadel (南定) with the nickname Ngũ Tinh Tụ Đẩu (五星聚斗).

Quốc âm tân tự is a type of phonetic syllabary script made from the strokes of chữ Hán and chữ Nôm, similar to Hiragana and Katakana of Japanese or Bopomofo in Chinese. Based on the pronunciation of Vietnamese, there are 22 &quot;cán tự&quot; (幹字) and 110 &quot;chi tự&quot; (枝字) (&quot;cán&quot; means trunk, &quot;chi&quot; means branches, &quot;tự&quot; means character). &quot;Cán tự&quot; is used to record the first consonant, and the &quot;chi tự&quot; is used to write the rhyme. Each character is named with a word that rhymes &quot;ông&quot; with the first consonant being the first consonant that the character signifies, for example, the word &quot;đ&quot; denotes the consonant &quot;đ&quot; is named &quot;đông&quot; (similar to today, the Vietnamese call the consonant &quot;đ&quot; the sound &quot;đờ&quot;). Quốc âm tân tự does not distinguish between &quot;d&quot; and &quot;gi&quot; as in Quốc ngữ (possibly because the author followed the Northern accent when &quot;d&quot; and &quot;gi&quot; sound almost the same). There is a shank used to record the initial consonant /ʔ/, which is named &quot;ông&quot;.

The author of Quốc âm tân tự used four stroke types: (一), (丨), (丶), (丿) (also including &quot;㇏&quot; as a variant of &quot;丶&quot;) to create the characters. Every character (including all &quot;trunk&quot; and &quot;branch&quot; characters) has a total of four strokes. Most of the characters only use two or three stroke types, but the total number of strokes is exactly four.

Quốc âm tân tự uses the traditional &quot;tone&quot; division, the tones are divided into four categories: &quot;bình&quot; (平), &quot;thượng&quot; (上), &quot;khứ&quot; (去), &quot;nhập&quot; (入). Each type is further divided into two degrees, &quot; âm&quot; (陰) and &quot;dương&quot; (陽). The tones in the old classification were called &quot;Âm bình&quot; 陰平 (&quot;ngang&quot;), &quot;Dương bình&quot; 陽平 (&quot;huyền&quot;), &quot;Âm thượng&quot; 陰上 (&quot;hỏi&quot;), &quot;Dương thượng&quot; 陽上 (&quot;ngã&quot;), &quot;Âm khứ&quot; 陰去 (&quot;sắc&quot;; for words that do not end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), &quot;Dương khứ&quot; 陽去 (&quot;nặng&quot;; for words that do not end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), &quot;Âm nhập&quot; 陰入 (&quot;sắc&quot;; for words that do end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/), and &quot;Dương nhập&quot; 陽入 (&quot;nặng&quot;; for words that do end in /p/, /t/, /c/ and /k/).

Tones of &quot;âm&quot; degree are marked with a small semi-circle, and tones of &quot;dương&quot; degree are marked with a small circle mark. To indicate serenity, the tone is placed next to the &quot;left foot&quot; of the word, with the bar mark placed next to the &quot;left shoulder&quot; of the word, with the accent bar placed next to the &quot;right shoulder&quot; of the text, with the accent bar placed next to the &quot;right foot&quot; of the text.

Quốc âm tân tự can be written vertically or horizontally like chữ Hán and chữ Nôm, and is a set of phonetic scripts created by the Vietnamese themselves (when chữ Nôm is a logographic system created by the Vietnamese, &quot;Quốc Ngữ&quot; is a phonetic script created by Francisco de Pina). When Quốc âm tân tự was created, it did not gain any widespread usage due to it just being a proposal, and because the political and social situation of Vietnam was too complicated at that time due to the gradual weakening of Nguyễn rule and the beginning of the French invasion.

=== Chữ Quốc ngữ ===

Vietnamese in Latin script, called &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, is the currently-used script. It was first developed by Portuguese missionaries in the 17th century, based on the pronunciation of Portuguese language and alphabet. For 200 years, chữ Quốc ngữ was mainly used within the Catholic community. However it was mainly used a tool for missionaries to learn Vietnamese. The main script for Vietnamese Catholic texts was chữ Nôm. During French administration, the alphabet was further modified and then later made a part of compulsory education in 1910.

Meanwhile, the use of chu Hán and chữ Nôm started to decline. At this time there were briefly four competing writing systems in Vietnam; &quot;chữ Hán&quot;, &quot;chữ Nôm&quot;, &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, and French. Although &quot;Gia Định Báo&quot;, the first Vietnamese newspaper in &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, was founded in 1865, Vietnamese nationalists continued to use chữ Nôm until after the First World War.

After French rule, &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot; became the favored written language of the Vietnamese independence movement.

BBC journalist Nguyễn Giang noted that while the early Christian missionaries are credited with creating the Vietnamese alphabet, what they did was not unique or difficult and would have been done later without them had they not created it. Giang further stated that the main reason for the popularisation of the Latin alphabet in the Nguyễn dynasty (the French protectorates of Annam and Tonkin) was because of the pioneering efforts by intellectuals from French Cochinchina combined with the progressive and scientific policies of the French government in French Indochina, that created the momentum for the usage of &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot; to spread. Giang stated that the Tonkin Free School only removed the stigma against using &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot; for the Nguyễn dynasty elites, but did not actually popularise it.

An important reason why Latin script became the standard writing system of Vietnam but not so in Cambodia and Laos -- which were also dominated by the French -- is because Emperors of the Nguyễn dynasty heavily promoted its usage. According to the historian Liam Kelley in his 2016 work &quot;Emperor Thành Thái&#x27;s Educational Revolution&quot; neither the French nor the revolutionaries had enough power to spread the usage of &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot; down to the village level. It was by imperial decree in 1906 that the Thành Thái Emperor parents could decide whether their children will follow a curriculum in &quot;Hán văn&quot; (漢文) or &quot;Nam âm&quot; (南音, &quot;Southern sound&quot;, the contemporary Nguyễn dynasty name for &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;). This decree was issued at the same time when other social changes, such as the cutting of long male hair, were occurring.

As a result of extensive education in &quot;chữ Quốc ngữ&quot;, Vietnamese people of today who are not versed in Chinese characters or Chinese-origin words are unable to read earlier Vietnamese texts written in Hán-Nôm. The Hán Nôm Institute is the national centre for academic research into Hán-Nôm literature. Although there have been movements to restore Hán-Nôm in Vietnam, via education in schools or usage in everyday life, almost all ancient poems and literary texts have been translated to and converted to chữ Quốc ngữ, which makes the need for literacy in Hán-Nôm almost obsolete. However, many Vietnamese find it difficult to detach themselves from their Hán-Nôm legacy, and may still feel an intimate relationship with Chinese characters.

===Sanskrit, Cham, Khmer and Indic scripts===
Sanskrit texts have often been passed over and translated to Vietnamese indirectly from Chinese texts via religious teachings from Buddhist sectors, or directly, such as from Champa and Khmer. One of the most significant landmarks still remaining to this day is the ancient &quot;Mỹ Sơn&quot; Hindu Temple which has Sanskrit and &quot;Champa&quot; inscriptions. The &quot;Võ Cạnh inscription&quot; is also the oldest Sanskrit inscription ever found in Southeast Asia, a legacy of &quot;Lâm Ấp&quot;, Champa, and Funan kingdoms. The most well-known modern Vietnamese phrase with Sanskrit phrase is from common religious Buddhist mantra नमोऽमिताभाय/ Namo Amitābhāya &quot;(Nam mô A Di Đà Phật&quot; / 南無阿彌陀佛), meaning, &quot;Hail Buddha of Infinite Light&quot; (translated directly from Sanskrit) or &quot;I pay homage to the Enlightened One immeasurable&quot; / &quot;I turn to rely on the Enlightened One immeasurable&quot;. Additionally, many sites in Vietnam have names that are Khmer in origin, from when the land was under Funan and Chenla reign, etc. For example, ស្រុកឃ្លាំង &quot;Srok Khleang&quot; is written as &quot;Sóc Trăng&quot; in Vietnamese. Hence, there is some Khmer influence in Mekong Delta, Vietnam.

===Tai Dam script===
The Tai Viet script is the abugida used by the Tai Dam people and other Southwest Tai-speaking peoples in Northern Vietnam, from 16th century to present-day, derived from the Fakkham script of Tai Lanna people.

===Jawi script===
From the onset of the 18th century, Cham communities in the Mekong Delta began adopting the Arabic-derived Jawi script. Today, the Western Cham (Cambodian and Mekong Delta Cham whom majority are Sunni Muslims) use both Jawi and Latin alphabets to write their language, compared to the Eastern Cham who are mostly Bani Muslims and Balamon and still using Akhar Thrah (traditional) script and Latin alphabets.

===Modern usage of &quot;chữ Hán&quot; and &quot;chữ Nôm&quot;===
Individual &quot;chữ Hán&quot; are still written by calligraphers for special occasions such as the Vietnamese New Year, &quot;Tết.&quot; They are still present outside Buddhist temples and are still studied for scholarly and religious purposes.

Vietnamese calligraphy (Thư pháp chữ Việt) has enjoyed tremendous success at the expense of &quot;chữ Hán&quot; calligraphy since its introduction in the 1950s.

Since the mid-1990s there has been a noticeable resurgence in the teaching of Chinese characters, both for &quot;chữ Hán&quot; and the additional characters used in &quot;chữ Nôm&quot;. This is to enable the study of Vietnam&#x27;s long history as well as cultural synthesis and unification.

For linguists, the Sino-Vietnamese readings of Chinese characters provide data for the study of historical Chinese phonology and reconstruction of the Old Chinese language.

Additionally, many Vietnamese may study Chinese characters as part of learning Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (since Japanese and Korean have a high concentration of Chinese-cognate words). In the process, they also end up with some measure of fluency with &quot;Hán–Nôm&quot; characters.

The significance of &quot;chữ Hán&quot; and &quot;chữ Nôm&quot; has occasionally entered Western depiction of Vietnam, especially since French rule. Novelist E. M. Nathanson, for example, mentions &quot;chu Hán&quot; in &quot;A Dirty Distant War&quot; (1987).

==== Mixed script ====

It is known that Ho Chi Minh wrote in a mixed Vietnamese Latin–Hán-Nôm script. 

From the Sino-Vietnamese readings, some words have ended up in common vernacular Vietnamese. For example, &quot;nhất&quot; () has come to mean &quot;first&quot; and &quot;tứ&quot; () has come to mean fourth in vernacular Vietnamese. Modern Vietnamese can be thought of as a romanised or transliteration rendering of common Hán-Nôm words, that has since been used as the main medium of language in Vietnam.

<text>Europe Transparent () was a political party in the Netherlands. The party&#x27;s founder, Paul van Buitenen, announced its establishment on 8 April 2004. In the 2004 European Parliament election the party gained two seats, after a campaign that cost no more than €4,000. Van Buitenen and the number two on the list, Els de Groen, who had written about corruption scandals in Eastern Europe, joined the Greens–European Free Alliance party group as independent members. It has not contested an election since 2004.

The party claimed to be non-ideological; they aimed to fight for more open European government, against fraud, corruption and favouring of friends. Because the pursuit of this goal was their primary occupation, they participated only to a limited extent in the normal system of debates, reports, meetings, etc.

Their ultimate goal was to be able to disband themselves when they had made the European Union transparent.

<doc id="720301" wikidata="Q1278959" url="?curid=720301" title="Party of Serbian Unity">
<text>The Party of Serbian Unity (; abbr. SSJ) was a far-right, ultranationalist political party in Serbia founded by Željko Ražnatović. After its merging into the Serbian Radical Party, the Council of Serbian Unity was the formed to be the party&#x27;s successor in 2013.

== Goals ==
The key goals of the party were:
*Unity of the Serbian people
*Preserving the integrity and territory of Serbia
*Parliamentarism and Democracy
*Preservation of tradition, family and the Cyrillic script

== History ==
In 1992, a new party formed by Ražnatović called the Civic Group – Željko Ražnatović Arkan. It gained five seats in the National Assembly during the 1992 general elections. After changing to the SSJ in 1993, the party lost its five seats for failing to receive the 5% threshold. In 1998, the party moved its headquarters from Belgrade to Jagodina.

Following the assassination of Ražnatović in 2000, Borislav Pelević became president of the party. At the last legislative election in 2003, the SSJ was a part of the For National Unity alliance. However, the coalition failed to receive any seats. The SSJ merged into the Serbian Radical Party in 2007.

On 21 January 2013, the party was re-founded as the Council of Serbian Unity by Pelević, Slobodan Radosavljević and Jelena Kostić in Belgrade. The new party took part in the 2014 parliamentary election as part of the Patriotic Front coalition, but failed to reach the 5% threshold.

<text>20/20 is the 15th studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released February 10, 1969 on Capitol Records. The LP was named for being their 20th overall release when factoring in live albums and compilations. Much of &quot;20/20&quot; consists of outtakes from earlier albums. It reached number 3 on UK record charts and number 68 in the U.S. Brian Wilson was absent during most of the album&#x27;s recording after admitting himself into a psychiatric hospital, requiring brothers Carl and Dennis to retrieve several outtakes he had recorded years earlier. While Brian does not appear on the front cover, the inner gatefold of the original vinyl release features him alone, behind an eye examination chart.

The singles &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;Bluebirds over the Mountain&quot; preceded the album&#x27;s release by several months. The former was the band&#x27;s first attempt at revisiting the surf sound they had abandoned since &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, topping UK and Australian charts, and the latter contained the B-side &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;, based on a song by Charles Manson. The other singles were &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; and a rerecorded version of &quot;Cotton Fields&quot;. In 2018, session highlights, outtakes, and alternate takes were released for the compilation &quot;I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions&quot;.

==Background==
On June 24, 1968, the Beach Boys released the album &quot;Friends&quot;, which peaked at number 126 and remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart for 10 weeks. It became the group&#x27;s worst-selling album to date, with record sales in the US estimated at 18,000 units. To recuperate from the album&#x27;s poor sales, the band quickly released the standalone single &quot;Do It Again&quot;. The song was a deliberate throwback to the group&#x27;s early surf songs, and the first time they had embraced the subject matter since 1964. It reached the US top twenty and became their second number one hit in the UK. Biographer Chrisian Matijas-Mecca wrote that &quot;while this may have been some of Brian&#x27;s strongest work of the period, it did nothing to reverse the band&#x27;s decline in popularity.&quot;

Brian Wilson said that by early 1968, the group had begun losing thousands of dollars &quot;on stupid things ... cars, houses ... bad investments ... a heck of a lot of corporation money on Brother Records, our own company, and in boosting other artists who just didn&#x27;t make it, and didn&#x27;t have a single hit.&quot; One of these artists was Ron Wilson (no relation to Brian), who co-wrote &quot;We&#x27;re Together Again&quot; with him for the Beach Boys, but the group&#x27;s recording was left unreleased. In turn, Brian produced an ultimately unsuccessful solo single for Ron, a cover of &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, which was released by Columbia Records in September. Another artist that the group worked with was ex-convict Charles Manson, who was then seeking a career as a singer-songwriter. Dennis Wilson befriended Manson and was interested in signing him to Brother Records. Brian and Carl Wilson then co-produced several tracks for Manson at the Beach Boys&#x27; private studio located in Brian&#x27;s home. These recordings remain unheard by the public.

Over the summer of 1968, Brian attempted to record an arrangement of the 1927 show tune &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. According to music writer Brian Chidester, the session tapes &quot;reveal Wilson conducting the Beach Boys to such extreme perfectionism that both he and the band seem at the end of their rope with one another&quot;. Singer Danny Hutton recalled that Brian had expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his &quot;real decline started&quot;. Afterward, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, possibly of his own volition. 

Brian&#x27;s issues were not disclosed to the public, and sessions continued in his absence. Once discharged, Brian rarely finished any tracks for the band, leaving much of his subsequent Beach Boys output for Carl Wilson to complete. Regarding Brian&#x27;s participation on the group&#x27;s recordings from then, band engineer Stephen Desper said that Brian remained &quot;indirectly involved with production&quot; through Carl. Dennis said that Brian began to have &quot;no involvement at all&quot;, which forced the group to &quot;find things that [he] worked on and try and piece it together.&quot;

==Recording and content==

===Older songs===
According to biographer Keith Badman, the &quot;20/20&quot; sessions marked &quot;the emergence of Carl and Dennis as producers and of Steve Desper as the group&#x27;s engineer. Desper is now part of the Beach Boys&#x27; fold and remains a chief engineer on their work early into the [1970s].&quot;

The two oldest tracks on &quot;20/20&quot; were sourced from late 1966 sessions for the band&#x27;s unfinished album &quot;Smile&quot;. &quot;Our Prayer&quot; is a wordless hymn composed by Brian, while &quot;Cabinessence&quot; is a song written by Brian and Van Dyke Parks. Both tracks were given additional vocal overdubs by Carl and Dennis Wilson in November 1968 at Capitol Studios. According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Brian was opposed to the inclusion of those tracks and refused the invitation to participate in the overdub sessions. Desper commented that &quot;Cabinessence&quot; was &quot;finished, more or less, with Brian&#x27;s guidance through Carl.&quot;

&quot;Bluebirds over the Mountain&quot; is a cover of the 1958 Ersel Hickey song, produced by Bruce Johnston in September 1967 at Western Studio and completed in October 1968 at Bell Sound. &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; was written and produced by Brian for the group Redwood (later Three Dog Night) between sessions for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (1967). It was completed by the Beach Boys in November 1968 at their studio.

===May – July 1968 sessions===

&quot;Do It Again&quot;, a Brian Wilson and Mike Love collaboration, was the first track that was worked on after concluding the sessions for &quot;Friends&quot;. It was recorded in May and June 1968, released as a single two weeks later, and ultimately chosen as the opening track for &quot;20/20&quot;. Brian later called it the finest song that he wrote on the album. The album mix differs slightly in that it briefly segues into another &quot;Smile&quot; outtake, &quot;Workshop&quot;, which consists of construction noises and sounds from carpentry tools. &quot;I Went to Sleep&quot; is a waltz written by Brian and Carl with a gentle mood and observational lyrics similar to other Brian songs of the period. &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot; is an instrumental produced by Bruce Johnston with the string arrangement by Van McCoy. The title came from a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article written by Shana Alexander.

Leftover tracks from these initial sessions included &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;, &quot;Well You Know I Knew&quot;, &quot;Been Way Too Long&quot; (also known as &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Too Long&quot;), &quot;Walk On By&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Together Again&quot;, &quot;Sail Plane Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Loop de Loop&quot;), &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot;, and a demo of &quot;Mona Kona&quot;. &quot;Been Way Too Long&quot; is an unfinished song started by Brian in 1967. &quot;Walk On By&quot; is a cover of the 1963 Burt Bacharach/Hal David song, recorded at Brian&#x27;s studio on the same day as the first &quot;Do It Again&quot; session. &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; was intended to be in medley with the standard &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot; is a song written and sung by Brian that was worked on for two days in June 1968. Band archivist Mark Linett said &quot;he gets so disgusted singing it that you hear him throw down his headphones and that&#x27;s the last time anybody ever heard of it.&quot; Also recorded, according to band manager Nick Grillo, was &quot;a hundred hours of [Manson&#x27;s] music at [Brian&#x27;s home] studio&quot;.

===September – November 1968 sessions===

For the majority of July and August, the Beach Boys toured the US and appeared on a few television talk shows. Most of the subsequent new material was tracked at Capitol Studios. Carl produced a rendition of the Ronettes&#x27; 1966 song &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; for the group, and it was the first time he was given a sole production credit. Brian said that he also contributed to the recording, explaining &quot;I wanted the instrumental track ... to be smooth and subliminal. I used acoustic guitars. Carl wailed on the lead.&quot; Biographer David Leaf called it &quot;the turning point in the transition of musical control in the Beach Boys from Brian to Carl&quot;. Brian also produced a version of Huddie Ledbetter&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Fields&quot; that he later called &quot;one of the best [records] we&#x27;ve ever made&quot;. The idea was suggested by bandmate Al Jardine, who thought they might be able to replicate the success of &quot;Sloop John B&quot; (1966).

&quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot; was originally written by Charles Manson under the title &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;. According to Carlin, Manson penned &quot;Cease to Exist&quot; specifically for the Beach Boys to record, and biographer Steven Gaines said that Manson &quot;reportedly&quot; wrote the song to help ease tensions within the group. Dennis produced the Beach Boys&#x27; version in September 1968, reworking the song&#x27;s bluesy structure and altering its lyric (the opening lyric &quot;Cease to exist&quot; modified to &quot;Cease to resist&quot;). The title was also changed to &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;, much to Manson&#x27;s indignation.

Dennis wrote and produced two more songs that appear on the album. &quot;Be with Me&quot; was described by Leaf as &quot;dark and eerie ... perfectly capturing his emotions of the era.&quot; &quot;All I Want to Do&quot; is a rocker that features the sounds of Dennis having sexual intercourse with a groupie. Also recorded was Dennis&#x27; &quot;A Time to Live in Dreams&quot; (released on 2001&#x27;s &quot;Hawthorne, CA&quot;) and &quot;Mona Kana&quot; (released on 2013&#x27;s &quot;Made in California&quot;).

==Packaging==
The cover photo includes every member of the group except Brian, which Matijas-Mecca referred to as &quot;a sign that the group was determined to forge their own identity without their founding architect.&quot; A photograph of Brian hiding behind an eye examination chart does appear on the gatefold cover.

==Release and reception==
Lead single &quot;Bluebirds over the Mountain&quot; (backed with &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;) was issued on November 29, 1968, in the UK (number 33) and three days later in the U.S. (number 61), becoming the group&#x27;s lowest-charting single since their 1961 debut &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;. After touring the UK in December, the Beach Boys returned to the studio to work on the album that would become &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970).

Released on February 10, 1969, &quot;20/20&quot; sold better than &quot;Friends&quot;, peaking at number 3 in the UK and reaching number 68 in the US. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Arthur Schmidt said the album was &quot;good, [but] flawed mainly by a lack of direction (a sense of direction being last evident in &quot;Wild Honey),&quot; more a collection than a whole.&quot; An uncredited writer from &quot;Hit Parader&quot; opined that it was the band&#x27;s best album since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and an improvement over the &quot;baffling&quot; &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. A reviewer for the underground paper &quot;Rat Subterranean News&quot; commented that even though it was &quot;against all my carefully established principles to like The Beach Boys,&quot; he enjoyed the LP, yet described most of side one as &quot;weak&quot;.

In August, Charles Manson and his cult of followers committed the Tate–LaBianca murders, and three months later, were apprehended by police. Their former connections with Dennis and the Beach Boys became the subject of media attention. Manson was later convicted for several counts of murder and conspiracy to murder. During the trial, Manson released his debut album, &quot;&quot;, which included his original arrangement of &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;.

Among retrospective assessments of &quot;20/20&quot;, critic Richie Unterberger wrote that it was &quot;one of their better post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; records ... The highlights, however, were a couple of &quot;Smile&quot;-session-era tunes ... as hard as they were trying to establish their identity as an integrated band in the late &#x27;60s, their new recordings were overshadowed by the bits and pieces of &quot;Smile&quot; that emerged at the time.&quot; Biographer David Leaf called it &quot;one of the most artistically interesting releases of their career and certainly one of the stronger later LPs.&quot; Peter Ames Carlin wrote that &quot;whatever the album lacked in thematic coherence, it made up in the quality of the pieces contributed by each band member.&quot; &quot;Brooklyn Vegan&quot;″s Andrew Sacher said that the first side is &quot;uneven and often disappointing&quot;, yet side two is &quot;almost flawless&quot;.

===&quot;Friends / 20/20&quot; 1990/2001 CD reissue bonus tracks===
===&quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;===


On December 7, 2018, Capitol released &quot;I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions&quot;, a digital-only compilation. Included are session highlights, outtakes, and alternate versions of &quot;20/20&quot; tracks, as well as some unreleased material by Dennis Wilson. It was released in conjunction with &quot;Wake the World: The Friends Sessions&quot;. The compilations were not issued on physical media due to the project being greenlit too late into the year, as well as the record company&#x27;s wish not to interfere with the release of &quot;The Beach Boys with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;. In 2021, &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; was followed with &quot;Feel Flows: The Sunflower and Surf&#x27;s Up Sessions&quot;.

<doc id="720333" wikidata="Q5519997" url="?curid=720333" title="Gameel Al-Batouti">
<text>Gameel Al-Batouti (; also rendered &quot;Gamil El Batouti&quot; or &quot;El Batouty&quot; in U.S. official reports; 18 october 1940 – 31 October 1999) was a pilot for EgyptAir and a former officer for the Egyptian Air Force. On 31 October 1999, he and 216 passengers and crew on board EgyptAir Flight 990 were killed when the Boeing 767-300ER he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about southeast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded and stated that the crash was caused by a series of deliberate flight control inputs to the aircraft made by Al-Batouti, while being alone in the cockpit and in the position of relief first officer. Investigators learned from another EgyptAir pilot that Al-Batouti was supposedly reprimanded for repeated inappropriate behaviour with female guests at the Hotel Pennsylvania, a New York City hotel often used by EgyptAir crews, by an EgyptAir offical who was a passenger on the flight.

== Early life ==
Al-Batouti was born in the farming community of Kafr al-Dabusi, Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. His father was a mayor and a landowner, and family members were well educated and affluent.

== Career ==
Al-Batouti had been conscripted into the Egyptian Air Force, where he was trained as a pilot and flight instructor. He then worked for a time as an instructor at the Egypt Aviation Academy. His position there was described by one colleague as &quot;high profile.&quot;

While in the Air Force, Al-Batouti served as a pilot in both the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

Al-Batouti was hired by EgyptAir on 8 September 1987. He held type ratings for the Boeing 737-200, Boeing 767-200 and the 767-300. At the time of the crash, he had logged 12,538 hours of flight time, with 5,755 as pilot in command and 5,191 in the 767.

Al-Batouti was approaching mandatory retirement (aviation regulations prevented him from flying as a commercial airline pilot after age 60), and had planned to split his time between a 10-bedroom villa outside of Cairo and a beach house near El Alamein.

At the time of his death, Al-Batouti was the most senior first officer flying the 767 at EgyptAir. He had not been promoted to captain because he declined to sit for the exam for his Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) rating. The ATPL study materials and exam are conducted in English, the international language of aviation, and Al-Batouti did not have sufficient English proficiency. Once he reached 55, the possibility of promotion was further hindered by EgyptAir policy which prevented promotions after that age. According to statements made by his colleagues to the NTSB during the Flight 990 investigation, he did not want to be promoted because, as senior first officer, he could get his preferred flight schedules, which assisted with his family situation. Despite not being promoted to captain, he was often called by that title because of his previous experience at the Egypt Aviation Academy.

Investigators learned from another EgyptAir pilot that Al-Batouti was supposedly reprimanded for repeated inappropriate behaviour with female guests at the Hotel Pennsylvania, a New York City hotel often used by EgyptAir crews. Hatem Roushdy, the EgyptAir official said to be responsible for the alleged reprimand, was a passenger on Flight 990. Investigators confirmed that shortly before the flight, Roushdy revoked Al-Batouti&#x27;s privilege of flying to the United States and informed him that Flight 990 would be his last on the route.

== EgyptAir Flight 990 ==

While Al-Batouti was momentarily alone in the cockpit when Captain Ahmed El-Habashi went to the lavatory, the aircraft suddenly went into a rapid dive nose-first, resulting in weightlessness (zero-g) throughout the cabin. Despite this, Captain El-Habashi was able to re-enter the cockpit. The speed of the 767 was now dangerously close to breaking the sound barrier, exceeding its design limits and beginning to weaken its airframe. The captain pulled back on his control column and applied full power to the engines, but neither action had any effect due to the aircraft&#x27;s speed and the engines having been shut down. The captain then deployed the speedbrakes, which slowed the aircraft&#x27;s dive, bringing it back to a safer speed. However, these abrupt maneuvers resulted in the aircraft entering a steep climb, causing g-forces to push the passengers and crew into their seats. Both engines then stopped completely, causing the aircraft to lose all electrical power and both flight recorders to stop at this point. The aircraft then fell into another steep dive and huge mechanical stress caused the left engine to separate from the wing. The aircraft began to break apart in midair at and debris crashed into the Atlantic Ocean at 1:52 am EST. All 217 people on board were killed.

Some of Al-Batouti&#x27;s final recorded words on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were &quot;Tawkalt ala Allah&quot; (), which can be translated as &quot;I rely on God&quot;, 11 times. This phrase can also be interpreted as &quot;I &quot;entrust&quot; myself unto God,&quot; hinting that he knew he was facing death, giving credence to the theory that he deliberately crashed the aircraft.

The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority disputes the cause of the crash, blaming mechanical problems rather than any action by Al-Batouti.

There was Western media speculation that Al-Batouti may have been a terrorist, although his family and friends indicated that he had no strong political beliefs.

==Personal life==
Al-Batouti was married and had five children. The youngest, a daughter who was 10 at the time of the crash, suffered from lupus, and was undergoing medical treatment in Los Angeles. Efforts had been made at EgyptAir, both at a company level and at an employee level, to provide assistance to help defray the medical expenses.

== In popular culture ==
Season 3, episode 8 of the Canadian television series &quot;Mayday&quot; titled &quot;Death and Denial&quot;, dramatizes the events and investigation of EgyptAir Flight 990. Gameel Al-Batouti was portrayed by Canadian actor Elias Zarou.

<doc id="720356" wikidata="Q848096" url="?curid=720356" title="Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom">
<text>In the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies, telephone numbers are administered by the Office of Communications (Ofcom). For this purpose, Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan, known as the &quot;National Telephone Numbering Plan&quot;, which is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations.

Telephone numbers are of variable length. Local numbers are supported from landlines. Numbers can be dialled with a &#x27;0&#x27;-lead prefix that denotes either a geographical region or another service. Mobile phone numbers have distinct prefixes that are not geographic, and are portable between providers.
==Structure==
All mobile numbers, nearly all geographic numbers, and nearly all non-geographic numbers have ten national (significant) digits after the trunk code &quot;0&quot;. The overall structure of the UK&#x27;s National Numbering Plan is:
A short sample of geographic numbers, set out in the officially approved (Ofcom) number groups:
In the United Kingdom, the &quot;area code&quot; is often referred to as a &quot;subscriber trunk dialling code&quot; (STD code) or a &quot;dialling code&quot;.
STD codes are two, three, four or, exceptionally, five digits long (after the initial zero). Regions with shorter area codes, typically large cities, permit the allocation of more telephone numbers as the local number part has more digits. Local customer numbers are four to eight digits long. The total number of digits is ten or, very rarely, nine. 

The code allocated to the largest population is (020) for London. The code allocated to the largest area is (028) for all of Northern Ireland. The UK Numbering Plan also applies to three British Crown dependencies – Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man – even though they are not part of the UK, these countries are closely related.

==Format==

Possible number formats for UK telephone numbers are:
Number ranges starting 01 can have National Significant Number (NSN) length of 10 or (very rarely) 9 digits. NSN is the number of digits after the leading 0 trunk code or +44 international prefix. The 0800 range can have NSN length as 10, 9, or 7 digits. The 0845 range can have NSN length as 10 or 7 digits. The 0500 range had NSN length as 9 digits only, and was withdrawn from use on 3 June 2017. All other UK numbers have NSN length of 10 digits. There are no telephone numbers in the UK with an NSN length of 8 digits.

==Geographic numbers==
===Standard geographic numbers===
Geographic telephone numbers in the UK always have nine or ten digits after the 0 trunk code or +44 international dialling prefix.

====Four-digit area codes====
Four-digit area codes have either six-digit subscriber numbers or a mix of five- and six-digit subscriber numbers.
* (01xxx) xxx xxx

This is the format used by most areas. It has a four-digit area code (after the initial zero) and a six digit subscriber number, and is known as 4+6 format. These area codes were changed by adding a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995. Just short of 581 areas use this format, and the area codes range from 01200 to 01998. Almost all (01xxx) area codes now have only six-digit subscriber numbers, but a small number of these areas also have some subscriber numbers only five digits in length (see next section).
Six of the four-digit area codes are known as &quot;mixed&quot; areas as they share those four digits with the twelve five-digit area codes. This leads to a restriction as to which initial digits can be used for subscriber numbers within those four-digit area codes, e.g. in the 01387 four-digit area code, subscriber numbers cannot begin with a 3 because 013873 is a separate five-digit area code; likewise in the 01946 four-digit area code, subscriber numbers cannot begin with a 7 because 019467 is a separate five-digit area code.
* (01xxx) xx xxx

This is used for forty smaller towns which have a mixture of six and five digit local numbers, each type allocated in specific DE blocks*; e.g. in the 01647 area code numbers beginning 24 and 61 have five digits (24xxx and 61xxx; known as 4+5 format) whereas all other DE blocks* within that area code have six digit numbers. The number of places with five digit subscriber numbers and an 01xxx area code has declined rapidly in recent decades. There were 511 ranges allocated across 56 different area codes in January 1998. The Big Number Change removed many, especially in Northern Ireland, and by July 2005 there were only 329 ranges in 42 codes. By April 2010 this had reduced to 324 ranges in 40 codes, with still the same number in November 2012. The 40 area codes are listed in the table below.

*A DE block is a block of numbers where (taking the area code and the subscriber number together) the initial 0 and the next six digits after it are the same for all the subscriber numbers in the block.

(These area codes, like many others, were changed by adding a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.)

====Three-digit area codes====
Three-digit area codes are generally used for the UK&#x27;s largest cities and conurbations (with the obvious exception of London) and always have seven-digit subscriber numbers and always begin 011x or 01x1. 

* (01x1) xxx xxxx

This is the geographic number format for the first round of five large cities moved to all figure dialling in the 1960s, and subsequently also used in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, eastern County Durham and south-eastern Northumberland from the 1980s onwards. These six areas have a three-digit area code matching the pattern &quot;1x1&quot; (after the initial zero) and a seven digit subscriber number, and this is known as 3+7 format. These area codes were changed by adding a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.

* (011x) xxx xxxx

This is the geographic number format for the second round of large cities and towns moved to brand-new three-digit area codes. Five of these were moved in 1995 as a part of PhONEday, with Reading then following a year later. At the time of the change, an extra digit was added to the subscriber number. These six areas have a three-digit area code matching the pattern &quot;11x&quot;, with a seven-digit subscriber number, and this is known as 3+7 format. The first three digits of the local number identifies a small area within the town or city. The former Reading area code had already been changed once, by adding a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.
====Two-digit area codes====
Two-digit area codes always have eight-digit subscriber numbers and always begin 02.
* (02x) xxxx xxxx

This is the newest geographic number format. It is used for the third round of changes for large cities and for Northern Ireland, and was formed as a part of the Big Number Change in 2000. The new area code is much shorter than the old one, and begins 02 unlike the previous 01 area codes. Numbers consist of a two-digit area code matching the pattern &quot;02x&quot;, and an eight-digit subscriber number, and this is known as 2+8 format. Numbers in these five areas are commonly misquoted, e.g. London incorrectly as 0207 or Cardiff incorrectly as 02920. 

The first four digits of the local number identifies a small area within the town, city or region. At the time of the change, the subscriber part of the number gained an extra digit in London, those in Northern Ireland gained two or three digits, and the subscriber part of the number in the other areas gained two digits. All of these areas were also subject to a previous code change, one that added a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995.
====Five-digit area codes====
Five-digit area codes have either five-digit subscriber numbers or a mix of four- and five-digit subscriber numbers.
Five-digit area codes always share their first four digits with four-digit area codes.
* (01xx xx) xx xxx and (01xx xx) xxxx

This is the oldest geographic number format and is used for twelve smaller towns and villages where the subscriber number is either five or (in one area code) four digits long. These are known as 5+5 and 5+4 format. Therefore, the STD code and the subscriber number does not always total ten digits after the initial zero trunk code. These area codes were changed by adding a &quot;1&quot; directly after the initial zero as a part of PhONEday in 1995. The number of places using these two formats has declined rapidly in recent decades and Brampton is the last place in the UK with four-digit local numbers.

The above twelve area codes and their six &#x27;parent&#x27; area codes (01387, 01524, 01539, 01697, 01768 and 01946) are known as &#x27;Mixed&#x27; areas due to multiple area codes sharing the same SABC digits (i.e. the initial zero and the following four digits).

===National-dialling-only ranges===
These ranges have subscriber numbers beginning with the digits &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, e.g.:

Currently, these numbers are mostly used as the termination points for non-geographic numbers, and by some automated systems such as alarms. As such they are not usually meant to be directly dialled. Using these numbers directly has been problematic as some mobile phone operators in the UK do not allow access to these ranges, and there may also be difficulty accessing these numbers from outside the UK.

Regulator Ofcom proposes that in future these ranges be released for wider, general-purpose use in up to 70 area codes facing number shortage but then, in order to avoid confusion with codes beginning with these digits, the area code would always have to be dialled for all calls, even from within the same geographic exchange. Accordingly, if these numbers are eventually released for general use, Ofcom proposes completely removing the ability to dial locally without the area code in areas affected.

Requiring the use of the area code also allows additional local numbers starting with normally protected Special Services numbers (such as 999, 101, 111, 112 etc.) to be used, significantly increasing the quantity of numbers available for use. This occurred on 1 November 2012 for the 01202 area code, which covers the Bournemouth area.

Recently, the carrier TalkTalk have inadvertently released parts of the 020 0011 range to the general public, with these numbers currently being in use. For example, the charity Give a Car used the number 020 0011 1664 for a while, but recently switched to a proper London number.

== Mobile telephones ==
* 07xxx xxx xxx—mobile phones and WiFi numbers.

Individual mobile phone companies are allocated different ranges within the 071xx, 073xx, 074xx, 075xx, 07624, 077xx, 078xx and 079xx prefixes. Changes to mobile phone numbers in the Big Number Change were mostly straight replacements, such as Vodafone customers on the 0378 block became 07778.
Since the advent of Mobile number portability, mobile phone number prefixes can no longer be relied on to determine the current operator of a particular mobile phone – only the original operator.

==Pagers and personal numbering==
* 07x xxxx xxxx—pagers and personal numbering (PNS).
Personal numbers beginning 070 are regulated by Phone-paid Services Authority.

Calls to 070 and 076 numbers are often charged at a much higher rate than the similar-looking 07xxx mobile telephone numbers and often they are not included in &quot;inclusive minutes&quot; in phone contracts.

From 1 October 2019, Ofcom has capped the termination or wholesale rate for calls to 070 numbers to be at the same level as for calls to mobile numbers. Ofcom &quot;expect[s] this will allow phone companies to price calls to these numbers or include them in call allowances in the same way that they do for calls to mobile [number]s&quot;.

==Non-geographic numbers==
===Non-geographic numbers charged at geographic rate===
* 03xx xxx xxxx—&quot;UK-wide&quot; numbering.

03xx is a range of non-geographic numbers introduced in 2007 as a cheaper alternative to the shared-cost non-geographic numbers (such as 0870 or 0845 numbers). In contrast to the 084x/087x range, calls to 03 numbers are considered local calls for billing purposes (i.e., like calls to a geographic number 01 or 02). This means that customers who are benefiting from inclusive minutes on mobile phone or landline calling plans are also able to call these numbers using their inclusive minutes.

There are four different ranges of numbers: those beginning 030x are reserved for qualifying public bodies and non-profit organisations; those beginning 033x can be allocated to anyone; and those beginning 034x and 037x have been allocated for migration from the matching 084x and 087x number ranges respectively.
===Corporate and VoIP numbering===
* 05x xxxx xxxx—Corporate and VoIP numbering.

Unlike 03 numbers there is no uniform pricing for 05 numbers; BT charge a number of different rates depending on the number dialled. Some are charged at geographic rate, others not. Other operators are not required to charge the same rates as BT for calling 05 numbers.
===Freephone numbers===
* 0500 xxx xxx—Freephone services allocated before 1999.

Until July 2017, the 0500 range was used for some freephone services which were originally provided by Mercury Communications Ltd (now Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide). These numbers were different from the rest of the 05 range in that they are only 9 digits in length after the 0 trunk code, e.g. 0500 007 007 (National Savings and Investments), 0500 2 88 2 91 (BBC Radio 2, 88 to 91 FM), 0500 600 600 (Crimewatch), 0500 600 700 (Watchdog) and 0500 909 693 (BBC Radio 5 Live, 909 and 693 kHz). Numerous universities, government departments, airlines, banks and businesses also used these numbers. They were allocated before the general trend of using longer numbers started in 1997 and long before the rest of the 05 range was assigned to corporate and VoIP numbering after 2000.
The range was withdrawn by Ofcom in July 2017 as a result of a series of consultations starting from 2012. The number range
08085 xxx xxx was made available to owners of 0500 xxx xxx to enable a smooth transition.

* 0800 xxx xxx, 0800 xxx xxxx and 0808 xxx xxxx—Freephone services.
There is one short &quot;special&quot; number in this range, 0800 11 11 for Childline.

Additionally, numbers in the range 0808 80x xxxx are reserved for not-for-profit helplines and as such are usually free to call from most mobile telephones. Many other numbers can also be called for free from mobiles, but this varies by network.

===Fixed-rate or special-rate services===
* 084x xxx xxxx (Special Services basic rate) – non-geographic fixed-rate or special-rate services
*087x xxx xxxx (Special Services higher rate) – non-geographic fixed-rate or special-rate services.

With the exception of 080x freephone numbers, 08xx numbers are charged above geographic rates, with some of the extra revenue going to the terminating telco. This additional revenue may be shared with the subscriber, but is often used instead to subsidise additional network services, such as fax-to-email, virtual office applications, call queuing, voicemail and easy number redirection. None of these call management services is exclusive to 08xx numbers and they could be provided on any number range.

There were a few short &quot;special&quot; numbers in this range, such as 0845 46 47 for NHS Direct; this was closed in 2014 (2015 in Wales) and replaced by NHS 111.
The usage of 0871, 0872 and 0873 numbers is regulated by PhonepayPlus.

There was widespread confusion about the cost of calling 084 and 087 numbers until 2015. They often do not qualify for discounts and bundled minutes, and can be prohibitively expensive when called from mobiles and payphones. Many major companies persist in misdescribing them as &quot;Local Rate&quot;, &quot;Lo Call&quot; (often as &quot; which can be easily misread as &#x27;local rate&#x27;) or &quot;National Rate&quot; for which the Advertising Standards Authority can take action.
====Access charge and service charge====
From 1 July 2015, the charge for calls to 084, 087, 09 and 118 numbers has been simplified. It is split into two parts: An access charge, payable to the telephone service provider – e.g. BT, EE, Sky – plus a service charge paid to the company offering the service.

Companies with 084, 087, and 09 numbers must declare the service charge element of the call cost when advertising their phone number; for example, a number may be advertised saying &quot;Calls cost 20p per minute plus your phone company&#x27;s access charge&quot;. Telecoms companies must inform their customers about their access charge for calling each number range. The EU Consumer Rights Directive requires that many entities that held 084 and 087 numbers will no longer be allowed to use them. The directive bans the usage of numbers that cost more than calling a geographic number for customer service and complaints lines, and other such purposes. Since Britain left the EU the Directive as such no longer applies, but its provisions may have been incorporated into British law.

===Other 08xx number ranges===
* 08xx xxx xxxx—Internet for schools and Inbound routing codes.

===Premium rate content services (PRS and SES)===
* 09xx xxx xxxx—Premium Rate Content Services

Numbers in the 09xx range are charged at the highest rates of any calls within the United Kingdom, and are controlled by various regulations regarding their use. The regulator is the Phone-paid Services Authority, formerly PhonepayPlus. There are a large number of charge bands, some with high pence-per-minute rates, others with a high fixed-price for the entire call.
The earlier unused 092x xxx xxxx – 099x xxx xxxx allocation for &quot;Broadband Internet Services&quot; no longer exists and was removed from the number plan in 2005.

=== Telex Service Numbers – initial Geographic Area Codes and applicable designation ===
Designation Numbers beginning 2 to 9 

10-digits long 
== Crown Dependencies ==
Although calls from UK landlines to landlines in the islands are charged at the same rate as those to other UK landlines (i.e. they are not treated as international calls), calls may be excluded from calling plans offering unlimited UK fixed-line calls.

Mobile operators may also charge more for calls to the islands and these calls are usually excluded from calling plans. Calls and SMS messages sent to island mobile phone numbers are not charged at the same rate as calls to UK mobile phone numbers.

=== Channel Islands ===
==== Guernsey ====
This area code is used for the Bailiwick of Guernsey (i.e. including Alderney and Sark).

==== Jersey ====
Several Jersey companies also have non-geographic numbers allocated.

=== Isle of Man ===
On the Isle of Man, both fixed (01624) and mobile phone (07624) numbers can be dialled locally in the six-digit format.

==Fictitious numbers==
Ofcom has also reserved certain number ranges for use in media productions, such as radio and television dramas and films; so as to avoid the risk of people having genuine telephone numbers displayed and receiving unwanted calls. This is similar to the use of fictitious telephone numbers in other countries.

In most of the large cities with three-digit area codes, a range of numbers is reserved, usually all the numbers starting with the digits 496. For fictitious numbers in other areas not using three-digit area codes, the area code 01632 is reserved; this code is not in use, although 0632 was previously used for Newcastle upon Tyne until the late 1980s (63 = NE), and briefly reallocated for use by premium rate services in the 1990s. There are also reserved ranges for fictitious mobile, freephone, and premium rate numbers.

The Post Office even produced dial centre labels for use in advertisements and film / TV with a mythical exchange called VINcent plus four digits. The numerical equivalent of VIN was 846, and all the caller got was the speaking clock (i.e. 846 is also numerical equivalent of TIM) in the big city &#x27;Director&#x27; areas.

At around the same time as the other Big Number Change changes, Ofcom revised their recommendations to update the prefixes, add additional areas and increase the size of the allocation from 10 to 1,000 numbers per block. Those changes are listed in the Big Number Change article.

In &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, the fictional Manchester suburb of Weatherfield uses the unallocated range .

Mobile numbers beginning with 07700 are frequently seen in TV dramas. These numbers have been specifically set aside for TV and radio dramas.

== Special service numbers ==
=== Emergency services and helplines ===
The UK has two free emergency numbers: the traditional 999, which is still widely used, and the EU standard 112. Both 999 and 112 are used to contact all emergency services: Police, Fire Service, Ambulance Service and Coastguard. (Standard advice for Mountain Rescue or Cave Rescue is to ask the emergency operator for the police, who oversee the communication with these two services.)

Both numbers can be called from mobile phones with the keylock on or without entering the PIN where that would otherwise be required. Although some mobile phones allow emergency calls to be attempted without a SIM card, at present the UK networks reject such calls. Since November 2009, an emergency call can be made through any UK mobile network as long as there is a SIM for any valid UK network in the handset. Although UK VOIP phone providers are required to offer 999 / 112 service, this is subject to a registration for the service and with a verified service address and users need to be aware such service may not work in a power blackout; however, International VOIP providers may not provide this service.

The chargeable number 101 was introduced for non-urgent crime and community safety calls on a trial basis in 2006. In Wales, the scheme was taken forward by all four police forces, who adopted the number for non-emergency calls on a permanent basis in early 2009. In England, the scheme was on trial until 2012, when it was adopted nationwide and the cost to call changed from 10p per call to 15p per call. In Northern Ireland, the number was introduced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in March 2014. Since 1 April 2020 the number is free to call.

The operator is obtained via 100 from landlines, while directory enquiries, formerly &quot;192&quot;, is now provided in the 118xxx range, (not to be confused with 0118, the area code for Reading.) e.g. 118 212, 118 800, 118 500, 118 118, by different companies. International operator assistance is reached through 155.

From early 2010, the pan-European 116 number range came into use for social helplines. The first three numbers allocated were Missing People using 116 000 for a missing children helpline, the NSPCC ChildLine on 116 111, and Samaritans using 116 123 for an emotional support helpline. A recent consultation for the numbers 116 106 and 116 117 has yet to see any result.

The National Health Service (NHS) can be reached on 111 for non-emergency calls (from landlines and mobiles only). In other European countries, the number 116 117 is used for a similar purpose.

The NHS has also launched a COVID-19 helpline on 119 so that these calls do not go through the 111 call centre.

Local electricity network operators can be reached on 105 to report power cuts.

Two telephone helplines within the regular code space have only eight digits: 0800 11 11 for ChildLine and 0845 4647 for NHS Direct in Wales.

The number 159 (&#x27;Call 159&#x27;) has been introduced to give a standard number for calling banks, in an effort to reduce scams where people are tricked into calling someone pretending to be their bank.

=== Speaking clock ===
Since the mid-1990s, speaking clock services have been available throughout Great Britain using the number 123. Before this, exchanges in &quot;Director&quot; areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) dialled 846 (TIM), later changing to 123; main exchanges in &quot;non-Director&quot; areas originally used &quot;952&quot;, later changing to &quot;80&quot; with the introduction of STD and eventually to &quot;8081&quot; as other recorded services were introduced on 80X1 codes. Some mobile operators allocate other services to 123, such as customer services or voicemail.

=== Automated services and access codes ===
Short codes beginning with 1 are reserved for telecom service providers&#x27; own functionality; some of the most well-known are codes for use with Caller Display:
Many fixed-line telephone subscribers, e.g. of BT, Virgin Media, SkyTalk, TalkTalk, and PlusNet, have the opportunity to use an automated messaging service which takes messages when the called number is either engaged (&quot;busy&quot;) or not answered within a given time. This can be accessed by calling 1571.

For fixed-line users, it is possible to override the carrier pre-selection (CPS) on a per-call basis, dialling a special code before the number, e.g. 1280 for BT, 1664 for LowerCall, or 1844 for Daisy. Ofcom defines the range for these as: &quot;124 to 140, 143 to 146, 148 to 149, 160 to 169, and 181 to 189, inclusive. Numbers of up to 5 digits used to access an Indirect Access Provider (&#x27;Type B Access Codes&#x27;)&quot;.

== History ==

<text>A smoke bomb is a firework designed to produce a large amount of smoke upon ignition.

==History==
Early Japanese history saw the use of a rudimentary form of the smoke bomb. Explosives were common in Japan during the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. Soft cased hand-held bombs were later designed to release smoke, poison gas, and shrapnel made from iron and pottery. The modern smoke bomb was created in 1848, by the British inventor Robert Yale. He developed 17th-century Chinese-style fireworks and later modified the formula to produce more smoke for a longer period.
Colored smoke devices use a formula that consists of an oxidizer (typically potassium nitrate, KNO3), a fuel (generally sugar), a moderator (such as sodium bicarbonate) to keep the reaction from getting too hot, and a powdered organic dye. The burning of this mixture boils the dye and forces it out of the device, where it condenses in the atmosphere to form a smoke of finely dispersed particles.

Home-made smoke bombs, even preceding Yale&#x27;s 1848 invention, were and are most commonly used in pranks and street conflicts. They are typically made from materials that burn poorly and contained in vessels with a limited air intake that inhibit combustion. Because both the ingredients and uses are unpredictable, home-made smoke bombs are often categorized as an incendiary device.

<text>The Ahom (Pron: ) or Tai-Ahom is an ethnic group from the Indian states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The members of this group are admixed descendants of the Tai people who reached the Brahmaputra valley of Assam in 1228 and the local indigenous people who joined them over the course of history. Sukaphaa, the leader of the Tai group and his 9,000 followers established the Ahom kingdom (1228–1826 CE), which controlled much of the Brahmaputra Valley in modern Assam until 1826.

The modern Ahom people and their culture are a syncretism of the original Tai and their culture and local Tibeto-Burman people and their cultures they absorbed in Assam. The local people of different ethnic groups of Assam that took to the Tai way of life and polity were incorporated into their fold which came to be known as Ahom as in the process known as Ahomisation.

Many local ethnic groups that came in contact with the Tai settlers, including the Borahis who were of Tibeto-Burman origin, were completely subsumed into the Ahom community; while members of other communities, based on their allegiance to the Ahom kingdom or the usefulness of their talents, too were accepted as Ahoms. Currently, they represent the largest Tai group in India, with a population of nearly 4.6 million in Assam. Ahom people are found mostly in Upper Assam in the districts of Golaghat, Jorhat, Sibsagar, Charaideo, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia (south of Brahmaputra River); and in Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Bishwanath, and Dhemaji (north) as well as some area of Nagaon, Guwahati.

Even though the already admixed group Ahom made up a relatively small portion of the kingdom&#x27;s population, they maintained their original Ahom language and practised their traditional religion till the 17th century, when the Ahom court as well as the commoners adopted the Assamese language.

==History==

===Origins===
The Tai speaking people came into prominence first in the Guangxi region, in China, from where they moved to mainland Southeast Asia in the middle of the 11th century after a long and fierce battle with the Northern Han Chinese. The Tai-Ahoms are traced to either Mong Mao of South China (present-day Dehong, Yunnan province of China) or to the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar.

Sukaphaa, a Tai prince of Mong Mao, and a band of followers reached Assam in 1228 with an intention of settling there. They came with a higher technology of wet-rice cultivation then extant and a tradition of writing, record keeping, and state formation. They settled in the region south of the Brahmaputra River and to the east of the Dikhow River; the Ahoms today are found concentrated in this region. Sukaphaa, the leader of the Tai group and his 9,000 followers established the Ahom kingdom (1228–1826 CE), which controlled much of the Bramhaputra valley until 1826.

===Initial formation in Assam===
In the initial phase, the band of followers of Sukaphaa moved about for nearly thirty years and mixed with the local population. He moved from place to place, searching for a seat. He made peace with the Borahi and Moran ethnic groups, and he and his mostly male followers married into them, creating an admixed population identified as Ahoms and initiating the process of Ahomisation. The Borahis, a Tibeto-Burman people, were completely subsumed into the Ahom fold, though the Moran maintained their independent ethnicity. Sukaphaa established his capital at Charaideo near present-day Sivasagar in 1253 and began the task of state formation.

===Ahomisation===
The Ahoms held the belief that they were destined by a divine force to cultivate fallow land using their wet-rice farming methods and to assimilate stateless shifting cultivators into their society. They were also conscious of their numerical minority. As a result, the Ahom polity initially absorbed Naga, Borahi and Moran, and later large sections of the Chutia and the Dimasa-Kachari peoples. This process of Ahomisation went on until the mid-16th century, when the Ahom society itself came under the direct Hindu influence. That many indigenous peoples were ceremonially adopted into Ahom clans are recorded in the chronicles. Since the Ahoms married liberally outside their own exogamous clans and since their own traditional religion resembled the religious practices of the indigenous peoples the assimilation under Ahomisation had little impediment.

===Localisation and Loss===
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the small Ahom community expanded their rule dramatically toward the west and they successfully saw off challenges from Mughal and other invaders, gaining them recognition in world history. The rapid expansion resulted in the Ahom people becoming a small minority in their own kingdom, of which they kept control. Eventually, the Ahom court, as well as the Ahom peasants took to Ekasarana dharma, Shaktism and Saivism over the traditional Ahom religion; and adopted Assamese over the Ahom language for secular purposes. 
The modern Ahom people and their culture are a syncretism of the original Tai and their culture and local Tibeto-Burman peoples and their cultures they absorbed in Assam.

The everyday usage of Ahom language ceased completely by the early 19th-century. The loss of religions is also nearly complete, with only a few priestly families practising some aspects of it. While the written language (and ritualistic chants) survive in a vast number of written manuscripts, much of the spoken language is lost because the Ahom script does not mark tone and under-specifies vowel contrasts.

===Revivalism===
Though the first political organisation (All Assam Ahom Association) was created in 1893 it was in 1954 when Ahom connection to other Tai groups in Assam was formally established.

==Society==
=== &quot;Ban-Mong&quot; Social system ===
The Tai-Ahom people&#x27;s traditional social structure, called Ban-Mong, revolved around agriculture and centered on irrigation methods. The &quot;Ban&quot; or &quot;Ban Na&quot; is a unit composed of families that settled by the side of the rivers. While many &quot;Bans&quot; together forms a &quot;Mong&quot; which refers state.

===Ahom clans===
Ahom clans, called &quot;phoid&quot;s, formed socio-political entities. At the time of ingress into Assam, or soon thereafter, there were seven important clans, called &quot;Satghariya Ahoms&quot; (Ahoms of the Seven Houses). There were Su/Tsu (Tiger) clan to which the Chao-Pha (Sukaphaa) belonged; his two chief counselors Burhagohain (&quot;Chao-Phrung-Mung&quot;) and Borgohain (&quot;Chao-Thao-Mung&quot;); and three priestly clans: Bailung (&quot;Mo-plang&quot;), Deodhai (&quot;Mo-sham&quot;), Mohan (&quot;Mo-hang&quot;) and Siring. Soon the &quot;Satghariya&quot; group was expanded—four additional clans began to be associated with nobility: Dihingia, Sandikoi, Lahon and Duarah. In the 16th-century Suhungmung added another great counselor, the Borpatrogohain and a new clan was established. Over time sub-clans began appearing. Thus during the Suhungmung&#x27;s reign, the Chao-Pha&#x27;s clan were divided into seven sub-clans—Saringiya, Tipamiya, Dihingiya, Samuguriya, Tungkhungiya, Parvatiya, and Namrupiya. Similarly, Burhagohain clan were divided into eight, Borgohain sixteen, Deodhai twelve, Mohan seven, and Bailung and Siring eight each. The rest of the 
Ahom gentry belonged to clans such as &quot;Chaodangs&quot;, &quot;Gharphalias&quot;, &quot;Likchows&quot; etc. In general, the secular aristocratic clans, the priestly class, and the gentry clans did not intermarry.

Some clans admitted people from other ethnic groups as well. For example, Miri-Sandikoi and Moran-Patar were Sandikoi and Patar from the Mising and Moran communities, while the founders of Chetias and Lahons were from the Chutia community. This was true even for the priestly clans: Naga-Bailung, Miri-Bailung and Nara-Bailung.

==Literature==
The Ahoms were literate with a writing system based on the Ahom script, which fell into disuse along with the language. The Ahom script evolved from an earlier script of the Tai Nuea language which developed further under the present Chinese Government. There exists today a large corpus of manuscripts in this script on history, society, astrology, rituals, etc. Ahom people used to write their chronicles known as &quot;Buranji&quot;. The priestly classes (Mo&#x27;sam, Mo&#x27;hung, Mo&#x27;Plong) are the custodians of these manuscripts.

===Calendar===
The Ahom people used to use a sexagenary cycle known as &quot;Lak-Ni Tao-Si-Nga&quot; with its origins in the middle kingdoms (Chung-Kuo). It has 12 months and an additional leap month with a ten days weekly cycle. The first month is called &quot;Duin-Shing&quot; which gregorian equivalent is November-December and the new year festival is known as &quot;Pi-Mau Tai&quot;. It is still in vogue in Chinese and Tai people. The events in Buranji was counted with &quot;Lak-ni&quot;.

==Culture==
===Festivals===
====Me-dam-me-phi====

Me-dam-me-phi is the communal ancestor worship festival of Tai-Ahom. It&#x27;s observed in the month of Duin-Ha (March–April)in the ancient 
times but now it&#x27;s celebrated in the 31st January.

====Poi cheng ken====
Poi cheng ken is the traditional spring festival of the Tai-Ahom people, celebrated during the Ahom month of Duin-Ha in the Sexagenary cycle. The festival includes rituals such as washing, particularly bathing household cattle, honoring ancestors, and worshipping the insignia &quot;Chum Pha Rueng Sheng Mueang&quot;. The customs of Cheng Ken are documented in the ancient manuscript &quot;Khyek Lai Bet&quot;. As stated: 

===Housing===
Like the rural Thai people of Thailand, the house rural Ahom families have been made of wood and bamboo, and two roofs are typically thatched. Families&#x27; orchards and ploughed fields are situated near their house. Houses are built in a scattered fashion within bamboo groves. At one time, the Ahom built their house on stilts called Rwan Huan about two meters above ground level.

===Culinary traditions===
Food is one of the important variables of the culture of Tai-Ahom. Most Ahoms, particularly in rural areas, are non-vegetarian, still maintaining a traditional cuisine similar to other Tai people. Rice is a staple food. Typical dishes are pork, chicken, duck, slices of beef, frogs, many kinds of fishes, &quot;hukoti maas&quot; (dry preserved fish mixture), &quot;muga lota&quot; (cocoon seeds of endi and muga worms), and eggs of red ants. Certain insects are also popular foods for the Ahoms. &quot;Luk-Lao&quot; or &quot;Nam-Lao&quot; (rice beer, undiluted or diluted) are traditional drinks. They consume &quot;Khar&quot; (a form of alkaline liquid extracted from the ashes of burned banana peels/bark), &quot;Betgaaj&quot; (tender cane shoots), and many other naturally grown herbs with medicinal properties. However beef for the general hindus and, pork for the Vaisnavites are avoided During Siva Singha&#x27;s reign, the people abandoned the free usage of meat and drinks.

Ahom food specialties resemble Thai cuisine. Like the Thais, the Ahoms prefer boiled food that have little spices and directly burnt fish, meat and vegetables like brinjal, tomato, etc. Some of them are &quot;Thu–dam&quot; (black lentil), &quot;Khao–Moon&quot; (Rice Frumenty), &quot;Xandohguri&quot; (a powder made from dry roasted rice), &quot;ChewaKhao&quot; (steamed rice), &quot;Chunga Chaul&quot; (sticky rice cooked in tender bamboo tubes), &quot;Til pitha&quot; (sesame rice rolls prepared from sticky rice powder), and &quot;Khao-tyek&quot; (rice flakes). The process of preparation of this item was quite unknown to population other than the Ahoms and the Thais. Khao (unboiled soft rice prepared from a special variety of sticky rice with a unique technique), Tupula Khao (a kind of rice cooked and packed with a particular kind of plant leaf with good smell called &#x27;tora pat&#x27; and preserved bamboo sauce are some of the favourite food items of the Ahoms, which are similar to their traditional diet.

===Wedding===

&quot;Chaklong&quot; is the main marriage ritual among the twenty marriage rituals of Tai Ahom people. The name Cho Klong is derived from the Tai Ahom language [Cho=to combine, klong=ritual]. The ritual is described in an ancient Tai Ahom script &quot;Lai Lit nang Hoon Pha&quot;. 101 ban-phai-s (earthen lamps) or lights are lit. The bride offers the groom a &quot;heng-dan&quot; (sword) to protect her, their children, family, race and country. Sum of twenty rituals are performed in ahom wedding along with cho klong, including: 
*Ju-ron 
*Rik-Khwan
*Aap-Tang [Aap=Bath, Tang=devine]
*Chow Ban [worshipping sun]
*Jon-ming [Blessing given by Moloung priests]

==Religion==

The majority of present-day Ahoms profess Hinduism as their religion, yet there&#x27;s a movement aiming to rejuvenate the ancient Ahom faith. The Ahom religion started to decline since the days of Jayadhwaj Singha, he was the first Ahom king to adopt Ekasarana Dharma and to take initiation of the Auniati Mahanta. From Jayadhawaj Singha to Rantadhwaj Singha all were followers of Ekasarana Dharma. From Gadadhar Singha onwards the kings veered towards Shaktism. Siva Singha made the Shaktism the state religion, Suremphaa Rajeswar Singha (1751–1769) ordered Sanskritisation. All funerals were to be practised under the Hindu cremation rites, conducted by a Maithil Brahmin priest and a traditional priest. Nevertheless, Me-Dam-Me-Phi is widely celebrated.

==Language==
The Ahoms today use the Assamese language after the traditional language, the Ahom language, fell into complete disuse. The Ahom language, a member of the Tai branch of the Kra–Dai languages is now dead, with its tone system completely lost. Nevertheless, it is being revived by some Tai Ahom organisations.

From the latter part of the 20th century through the early 21st century, there has been a resurgence of interest among the Ahoms in their culture and language, resulting in heightened scholarly focus and efforts towards revival. The 1901 census of India enumerated approximately 179,000 people identifying as Ahom. The latest available census records slightly over 2 million Ahom individuals, however, estimates of the total number of people descended from the original Tai-Ahom settlers are as high as eight million. The Ahom script also finds a place in the Unicode Consortium and the script declared the topmost in the South-East Asia category.

==Ahom people today==
Ahom people today are categorised in the other backward classes (OBC) caste category; there is longstanding discussion and demand for Scheduled Tribe status. The term &quot;ethnic Assamese&quot; is now associated by the Indian government with the various indigenous Assamese people. According to Anthony Van Nostrand Diller, possibly eight million speakers of Assamese can claim genetic descent from the Ahoms. Historian Yasmin Saikia contends that during pre-colonial eras, the Ahoms didn&#x27;t constitute an ethnic community; instead, they formed a relatively inclusive social group. Any group entering the socio-economic framework of the Ahom state could acquire Ahom status, subject to the explicit approval of the king.

<text>Branislav Ivković (; born 7 August 1952), known as Bane, is a Serbian engineer, academic, and former politician. He was a cabinet minister in the government of Serbia from 1994 to 2000 and served in the parliaments of Serbia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Serbia and Montenegro. At one time a prominent figure in the Socialist Party of Serbia (&quot;Socijalistička partija Srbije&quot;, SPS), he led the breakaway Socialist People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Socijalistička narodna stranka&quot;, SNS) in the early 2000s.

==Early life, private career, and academic career==
Ivković was born in Bijeljina, in what was then the People&#x27;s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. Raised in the community, he graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Civil Engineering in 1979, earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1983, and received a Ph.D. in 1988 with the thesis, &quot;Optimization of reliability of production systems in construction.&quot; He became an assistant at the university in 1981, was promoted to assistant professor in 1989, and became an associate professor in 1994. Ivković has participated in engineering projects in Israel, Kuwait, and Russia, as well as in Serbia.

==Politician==
Ivković&#x27;s political career began in the 1990s, at a time the political life of Serbia and Yugoslavia was dominated by the authoritarian rule of Socialist Party leader Slobodan Milošević.

He appeared in the twenty-fifth position on the Socialist Party&#x27;s electoral list for the Belgrade division in the 1993 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won sixteen seats, and he was not awarded a mandate. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia&#x27;s electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates on successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates at the discretion of sponsoring parties or coalitions. Ivković could have been given a mandate despite his list position, though he was not.) The SPS won the election and afterward formed a new government. Ivković became vice-president of the party&#x27;s city board in Belgrade.

===Minister of Urban Development and Housing (1994–1998)===
Ivković was appointed as minister of urban development and housing in the first government of Mirko Marjanović on 18 March 1994. One of his responsibilities was finding accommodations for the large numbers of refugees who arrived in Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars of the mid-1990s. In September 1995, he described a $41.5 million pledge for refugee aid from the United Nations and related organizations as &quot;very meagre as compared to our needs.&quot; In February 1996, he said that refugees living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be permitted to return safely to their former homes.

He announced a fifteen-year plan for a cable television network in Serbia in 1996, noting the possibility of concessions to international investors.

In April 1997, Ivković brought forward a legislative package that, among other things, gave legal standing to several housing units that had been illegally constructed in the period up to and including November 1995. The stated purpose of this reform was to remove the threat of eviction from low-income households residing in these units. In response to Serbia&#x27;s chronic financial issues, he oversaw the passing of a controversial law that permitted international concessions for Serbia&#x27;s roads, power plants, airports, and other state property; he later introduced complementary regional development legislation allowing international mining concessions. In September 1997, he announced the creation of a state agency to co-ordinate activities related to international investments in Serbia. In the same period, he introduced &quot;tax holidays&quot; in a bid to convince construction firms that had left Serbia due to international sanctions during the Yugoslav wars to return to the country.

In October 1997, Ivković signed an agreement to restructure Serbia&#x27;s debts with Russian energy firm Gazprom, allowing for half of the total debt to be paid via construction projects over the next two years.

===Leader of the Belgrade SPS (1995–1997)===
Ivković&#x27;s political profile rose significantly in November 1995, when he was appointed as president of the SPS&#x27;s Belgrade board. This occurred against the backdrop of major personnel shifts in the party at the conclusion of the Bosnian War, when Milošević removed a number of figures considered too &quot;hardline&quot; in their views.

====1996 local elections====
Ivković led the SPS&#x27;s campaign in Belgrade in the 1996 Serbian local elections. The local party organization was divided during this time, with Ivković and incumbent Belgrade mayor Nebojša Čović leading rival factions. Rumours circulated that Ivković and Čović would be rivals for the mayor&#x27;s office in the event of a SPS victory. In the event, the opposition &quot;Zajedno&quot; (English: Together) coalition won the Belgrade election. State authorities did not initially accept the opposition&#x27;s victories in Belgrade and other major cities, leading to an extended series of protests; the state&#x27;s response to the protests was often violent.

Ivković was rebuked for the SPS&#x27;s poor performance in Belgrade. Following the initial reports of the SPS&#x27;s defeat, he told party officials that &quot;legal possibilities&quot; existed for annulling a number of opposition mandates and giving the Socialists victory in a repeat vote. Opposition victories in several constituencies were indeed annulled by the city&#x27;s election commission, and repeat elections were called for 27 November. The opposition boycotted the repeat vote, describing the process as fraudulent, and several SPS and aligned candidates were accordingly declared elected by default. Ivković was a vocal supporter of the repeat elections, at one time telling the Belgrade election commission, &quot;If the results are what we expect and which we feel are right, we’ll quickly organize a city assembly because we have to continue living normally in this city.&quot;

The opposition protests continued after the repeat elections in Belgrade. Ivković planned for a &quot;counter-protest&quot; rally organized by Milošević&#x27;s allies to end the controversy, but it instead resulted in increased protests from opponents of the administration. The Belgrade election commission later annulled the repeat elections and reinstated the victory of &quot;Zajedno&quot; in January 1997. Ivković said that the SPS would appeal the decision, but before this could happen he was replaced as the party&#x27;s Belgrade leader by Dragan Tomić. In the aftermath of these events, Čović described Ivković as &quot;the man most responsible&quot; for the party&#x27;s defeat in the city and accused him of election fraud. Ivković later remarked that he voted for his own dismissal as local SPS leader, having by this time lost his desire the continue in the role.

The Belgrade election commission&#x27;s recognition of the opposition&#x27;s victory did not bring an end to the election controversy, and the state authorities ultimately recognized the victory of &quot;Zajedno&quot; in Belgrade and other jurisdictions via a &quot;lex specialis&quot; in February 1997. Notwithstanding the broader controversy, Ivković was personally elected for New Belgrade&#x27;s fourth division.

Ivković, in his capacity as a University of Belgrade professor, later sought to initiate a dialogue with student leaders over the 1996–97 protests. The students responded, &quot;Your hands are bloody, blood was spilled because of your counter rally. You are too late.&quot;

===Federal parliamentarian (1996–2000)===
Ivković was elected to the Yugoslavian assembly&#x27;s Chamber of Citizens in the 1996 Yugoslavian parliamentary election, which was held concurrently with the local elections. Online reports do not indicate the division for which he was elected, though it may be reasonably inferred to have been New Belgrade, where the SPS alliance won two seats. The SPS alliance won the election, and Ivković served in the federal parliament for the term that followed. In May 1998, he supported the removal of Radoje Kontić as Yugoslavian prime minister and the election of Momir Bulatović as his successor.

===Minister of Science and Technology (1998–2000)===
The SPS formed a new coalition government with the far-right Serbian Radical Party (&quot;Srpska radikalna stranka&quot;, SRS) and the Yugoslav Left (&quot;Jugoslovenska Levica&quot;, JUL) following the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election. On 24 March 1998, Ivković was reassigned as Serbia&#x27;s minister of science and technology. He was also appointed to the provisional executive council of Kosovo later in 1998; in October of that year, he attended a meeting of the council in Priština.

During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Ivković took part in &quot;human shield&quot; rallies on Belgrade&#x27;s bridges. At one such rally in April 1999, he was quoted as saying of NATO&#x27;s actions, &quot;We must oppose with all our forces the new techno-fascism, which is worse than at the time of Adolf Hitler.&quot; In the same period, he called for closer co-operation between Serbia&#x27;s ministries to maximize the country&#x27;s resources and re-establish production in factories destroyed by NATO bombing.

In August 1999, following the conclusion of NATO&#x27;s bombing campaign, Ivković spoke at an event in Serbia called &quot;Diaspora 99&quot; and claimed that the country had produced its own air-to-air missiles. He received applause when he said, &quot;Some wish to turn us into a colony and they have thus introduced sanctions against us [...] They are trying to bring us to our knees economically and then buy us. We will not let ourselves be turned into a colony and that is why we are counting on you.&quot; Later in the year, he took part in a Serbian delegation to China to promote greater scientific and technological co-operation.

Ivković led a team of scientists and researchers to Iraq in June 2000 in a bid to improve relations between the two countries.

===2000 Yugoslavian elections and fall of Milošević===
Ivković did not seek re-election to the Chamber of Citizens in the 2000 Yugoslavian general election but instead appeared on the SPS&#x27;s electoral list for the upper house of the Yugoslavian parliament, the Chamber of Republics. At one point in the campaign, he took part in a radio debate on B92 with Nebojša Čović, who by this time had left the SPS and joined the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (&quot;Demokratska opozicija Srbije&quot;, DOS). When a series of polls taken in early September 2000 showed DOS candidate Vojislav Koštunica leading Slobodan Milošević in the Yugoslavian presidential election, Ivković accused the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of involvement, saying that the organization was seeking to manipulate those undecided voters who &quot;always go along with the strongest.&quot;

Koštunica ultimately defeated Milošević in the Yugoslavian presidential election, a watershed moment in Serbian and Yugoslavian politics. As in 1996, the state authorities did not initially accept the result and sought to introduce a repeat vote; following large-scale protests, however, the Milošević government was overthrown on 5 October 2000.

The DOS also defeated the SPS in the Yugoslavian parliamentary election. In the election for the Chamber of Republics, the DOS won ten seats as against seven for the SPS; Ivković did not receive a mandate and was not included in his party&#x27;s delegation for the new parliament. He was also defeated in his bid for re-election to the City Assembly of Belgrade in the concurrent 2000 Serbian local elections, losing to a candidate of the DOS in the downtown municipality of Vračar.

The SPS continued to dominate Serbia&#x27;s republican government in the early days after Milošević&#x27;s downfall, and on 11 October 2000 Ivković issued a direct challenge to Koštunica&#x27;s federal administration by saying that Serbia would assume direct control over the 100,000-member police force within its borders. Ultimately, however, the Serbian government was unable to continue in office without Milošević, and a new transitional government consisting of the SPS, the DOS, and the Serbian Renewal Movement (&quot;Srpski pokret obnove&quot;, SPO) was formed pending a new Serbian parliamentary election in December. The SPS initially nominated Ivković to continue as minister of science and technology in the new administration, but the DOS objected to his candidacy, with Nebojša Čović accusing him of responsibility for the beating of student protestors in 1996–97. Ivković rejected Čović&#x27;s accusation but agreed to withdraw his candidacy rather than delay the new administration, and his term in cabinet ended on 25 October 2000.

===SPS leader in the Serbian parliament (2001–2002)===
Serbia&#x27;s election laws were reformed prior to the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, such that the entire country became a single electoral division and all mandates were awarded to candidates on successful lists at the discretion of the sponsoring parties or coalitions, irrespective of numerical order. Ivković appeared in the sixty-fifth position on the SPS&#x27;s list, which was mostly arranged in alphabetical order. The list won thirty-seven seats, and he was chosen as part of his party&#x27;s delegation. When the new parliament convened in January 2001, he became the leader of the SPS&#x27;s assembly group. The DOS won a landslide majority victory with 176 out of 250 seats, and the SPS served in opposition.

Ivković was initially seen as a close associate of Slobodan Milošević in this period. On 7 March 2001, he said that he had recently visited Miloševič and described the former president as being in good spirits despite reports that he would soon be arrested on suspicion of war crimes. On 31 March, he played a crucial role in negotiating for Milošević to submit to an arrest warrant, bringing an end to an armed standoff at his mansion. When rumours circulated about Milošević&#x27;s pending extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague in June, Ivković spoke at a protest outside the Yugoslavian parliament building.

According to a report in the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, Milošević turned against Ivković the following month, describing him as a &quot;traitor&quot; who knew that his extradition was imminent but did nothing to prevent it. Ivković acknowledged being in conflict with Milošević&#x27;s wife Mirjana Marković during this period, although he said in August 2001 that their disagreements had been resolved and denied reports of a broader division in the party. He was not, at this time, removed from his role in the party leadership.

In early 2001, Ivković was investigated on suspicion of having directed funds from the ministry of science and technology to the SPS while he was a cabinet minister. He was also accused of illegally distributing several state apartments. He rejected the charges and said that he would not invoke parliamentary immunity. (His immunity was, in any event, removed in October 2001).

===SPS split and Socialist People&#x27;s Party leader (2002–2004)===
The SPS split in early 2002, with several party members accusing Ivković of co-operating with Serbia&#x27;s DOS administration and attempting a party takeover. Milošević openly turned against him at this time, accusing him of overseeing a &quot;fifth column&quot; bid to lead others away from the party. In April 2002, Ivković was formally expelled from the SPS. He rejected the legality of his expulsion and organized a congress of his supporters in June 2002, describing the event as a SPS meeting that would lead to renewal in the party. He was formally chosen as the group&#x27;s leader at this meeting; he paid tribute to Milošević in his acceptance speech but also called for the SPS to adopt a reformist approach under new leadership. In this period, Ivković was often described in the international media as a &quot;moderate.&quot;

Ultimately, Ivković&#x27;s group did not retain ownership of the SPS name. He ran in the September 2002 Serbian presidential election as the leader of an independent group called &quot;Socialists for Return to the Basics&quot; and was defeated, receiving just over one per cent of the vote. In October 2002, he announced plans to create a new party to be called simply the Socialist Party (&quot;Partija Socijalista&quot;, PS).

Ivković and his supporters established an assembly group called the People&#x27;s Socialists (&quot;Narodni socijalisti&quot;) in November 2002. The DOS government had experienced several splits and defections by this time, and the following month Ivković&#x27;s group co-operated with the administration on a crucial budgetary vote for the upcoming year. In this period, Ivković was a member of the committee for constitutional affairs and the committee for science and technological development.

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formally reconstituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, and the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro was established as its legislative branch. The first members of this body were chosen by indirect election from the republican parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro, with each parliamentary group allowed representation proportional to its numbers. Only sitting members of the Serbian assembly or the Montenegrin assembly, or members of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia at the time of the country&#x27;s reconstitution, were eligible to serve. The &quot;People&#x27;s Socialists&quot; group was allotted one seat in the federal assembly, which was assigned to Ivković.

Ivković&#x27;s group coalesced as the Serbian People&#x27;s Party (SNS) later in 2003. In September of that year, he proposed that the SPS and his party run a joint candidate in the upcoming presidential election. The SPS rejected the offer; Ivica Dačić accused Ivković of wanting to benefit the DOS by running as a candidate himself.

The SNS contested the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election in an alliance with a group called the &quot;People&#x27;s Blok&quot;. Ivković appeared in the second position on the party&#x27;s list, after former SPS parliamentarian Dobrivoje Budimirović. The list did not cross the electoral threshold, and Ivković&#x27;s terms in the federal and republican parliaments ended in early 2004. He ran as the SNS&#x27;s candidate in the 2004 Serbian presidential election and received less than one per cent of the vote.

He joined Bogoljub Karić&#x27;s Strength of Serbia Movement (&quot;Pokret Snaga Srbije&quot;, PSS) after the 2004 presidential election. The SNS afterward considered merging into the PSS, though it ultimately rejected the option.

Ivković has generally withdrawn from active political life since this time. After Milošević&#x27;s death in 2006, it was reported that he was the only former SPS &quot;dissident&quot; whose return to the party would not be welcomed.

==Since 2006==
Ivković joined the Serbian Progressive Party (&quot;Srpska napredna stranka&quot;, SNS) in 2012. He was named to the supervisory board of Energoprojekt in 2013 and was appointed to a new term in 2017.

In a January 2018 court decision, he was acquitted of charges of having illegally allocated state apartments in 2000.

Ivković said in a May 2022 interview that Serbian prime minister Zoran Đinđić had assisted Milošević&#x27;s defence at the ICTY starting in the summer of 2002 and was planning a massive shakeup in the Serbian government prior to his assassination in March 2003. Concerning his own political history, Ivković said that his departure from the SPS had been orchestrated by Mirjana Marković. He added that he had faced several criminal charges related to his time in cabinet and had been acquitted in all proceedings.

<text>Once is the fifth studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, released on 7 June 2004 by Spinefarm Records in Finland and Nuclear Blast in the rest of Europe. It is the fifth and last album to feature Tarja Turunen on lead vocals. The album cost nearly €250,000 to make (1,000,000 including the videos), which made it Finland&#x27;s most expensive recording ever until the release of Nightwish&#x27;s next album, &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot;, which cost over €500,000 to produce. As of 2013, &quot;Once&quot; had sold 2.3 million copies worldwide, becoming Nightwish&#x27;s most successful album to date. The remastering of the album was released on 6 August 2021.

==Background==
In a 2008 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; interview, Tuomas Holopainen remembered: &quot;Doing this kind of really orchestral, symphonic stuff for four albums, you have to be prepared to take the next step and go 10 steps beyond, and that&#x27;s how we ended up with the London Session Orchestra. At that time we also had the financial resources to do it. This was like our second breakthrough in a way; &quot;Oceanborn&quot; (1998) broke us, took us to the big league. Musically it was pretty laid-back from our side because everyone involved in the orchestra really knew their stuff, so we basically spent two days lying on the couch hearing all these people playing our songs, enjoying every moment. It was one of the most amazing experiences in my life. The first song they started to play was &#x27;Ghost Love Score&#x27;, we had no idea what to expect, and I just thought: This can&#x27;t be happening!&quot;

==Musical style==

The album continues the more streamlined musical approach first heard on &quot;Century Child&quot;, moving further away from the power metal-influenced sound of their previous albums into symphonic metal with a slightly more mainstream, approachable feel. &quot;Once&quot; utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album; unlike &quot;Century Child&quot;, Nightwish chose an orchestra outside of Finland, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which has been featured on every album released since.

&quot;Once&quot; is their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot;. The band added new elements to their music for this album, such as the chorus riff and synthesized drumbeat of &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot;, and a long prayer chant on &quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot;. The song &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot; was described by Hietala as follows: &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of old prog rock and this is a song that has a lot of different parts going on, and different atmospheres in different places in order to support the story. [...] My biggest influence from the prog world would be Jethro Tull, but I also love listening to Yes and Genesis and all those bands, and there&#x27;s a correlation between the structures and the length of a lot of their songs and this one.&quot;

==Artwork==
The angel on the album cover is a view of the Angel of Grief, a sculpture by William Wetmore Story. The original is in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome, Italy.

==Tour==

The success of the album allowed them to perform the Once Upon a Tour, which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki.

==Reception and legacy==
During the first week of its release, &quot;Once&quot; entered the Finnish, German and Norwegian charts at number one, later topping the European Top 100 Albums chart. It was also the first Nightwish album to chart in the United States, reaching No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and the band&#x27;s first album to chart in UK, reaching 10 on the Rock Chart. In 2005, &quot;Once&quot; was ranked number 383 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2017, it was ranked 89th at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Once&quot; has been certified double platinum in Finland, triple gold in Germany, and gold in Sweden. The single &quot;Nemo&quot; topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the top ten in four additional countries. It remained on the UK Rock Chart for more than a year. &quot;Nemo&quot; therefore remains their most successful single ever, and &quot;Once&quot; reached number 47 in the list of best-selling albums of all time in Finland. As of June 2013, the album had sold 2.3 million copies worldwide, Nightwish&#x27;s best-selling album to date.

<text>Bernd Posselt (born 4 June 1956 in Pforzheim) is a German politician, who served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 2014, representing the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) and the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). He is currently a member of the executive board of the CSU.

==Personal and professional background==

Posselt was born in Pforzheim, Baden-Württemberg as a son of expellees. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 2014. In 1998 he became president of the &quot;Paneuropa-Union Deutschland&quot;, the German branch of the International Paneuropean Union.

==Political and community activities==

Posselt is the leading German advocate of the rights of those Germans whose ancestors lived in the Sudetenland area of Bohemia as well as Moravia and who were expelled by the Potsdam conference and the governments in Central and Eastern Europe after the Second World War. His main goal - and the principal aim of the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft that he has led since 2000 - is to revoke the so-called Beneš decrees, as well as other acts of the post-war expulsions that were meant to punish the German population in the Sudetenland as a whole for its prevailing support of Nazism.

Posselt is respected in the Sudeten German community and in his home state of Bavaria. The conservative Bavarian government has often supported the Sudeten German community, and was among those demanding that the Czech Republic should repeal the Beneš decrees before being allowed into European Union.

<doc id="720407" wikidata="Q310359" url="?curid=720407" title="John of Capistrano">
<text>John of Capistrano, OFM (, , , ; 24 June 1386 – 23 October 1456) was a Franciscan friar and Catholic priest from the Italian town of Capestrano, Abruzzo. Famous as a preacher, theologian, and inquisitor, he earned himself the nickname &quot;the Soldier Saint&quot; when in 1456 at age 70 he led a Crusade against the invading Ottoman Empire at the siege of Belgrade with the Hungarian military commander John Hunyadi.

Elevated to sainthood, he is the patron saint of jurists and military chaplains, as well as the namesake of two Franciscan missions, one in Southern California and the other in San Antonio, Texas.

==Early life==
As was the custom of this time, John is denoted by the village of Capestrano, in the Diocese of Sulmona, in the Abruzzi region, Kingdom of Naples. His father had come to Italy with the Angevin court of Louis I of Anjou, titular King of Naples. He studied law at the University of Perugia.

In 1412, King Ladislaus of Naples appointed him Governor of Perugia, a tumultuous and resentful papal fief held by Ladislas as the pope&#x27;s champion, in order to effectively establish public order. When war broke out between Perugia and the House of Malatesta in 1416, John was sent as ambassador to broker a peace, but the Malatestas threw him in prison. It was during this imprisonment that he began to study theology. When he was released, he decided to become a Franciscan friar, citing a dream where Saint Francis of Assisi ordered him to enter the Order. He had married before the war, but asserted that the marriage was never consummated and received permission to take holy orders.

==Friar and preacher==
Together with James of the Marches, John entered the Order of Friars Minor at Perugia on 4 October 1416. Along with James, he studied theology at Fiesole, near Florence, under Bernardine of Siena. He soon gave himself up to the most rigorous asceticism, vigorously defending the ideal of strict observance and insisting on purity of doctrine, following the example set by Bernardine. From 1420 onwards, he preached with great effect in numerous cities and eventually became well known. He was ordained in 1425.

Unlike most Italian preachers of repentance in the 15th century, John was effective in northern and central Europe– in German states of Holy Roman Empire, Bohemia, Moravia, Austria, Hungary, Croatia, and the Kingdom of Poland. Even the largest churches could not hold the crowds that gathered to hear him, so he preached in the public squares; at Brescia in Italy, he preached to a crowd of 126,000.

==Reformer==

When he was not preaching, John was writing tracts against heresy of every kind. This facet of his life is covered in great detail by his early biographers, Nicholas of Fara, Christopher of Varese and Girlamo of Udine. While he was thus evangelizing, he was actively engaged in assisting Bernardine of Siena in the reform of the Franciscan Order, largely in the interest of a more rigorous discipline in the Franciscan communities. Like Bernardine, he strongly emphasized devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus, and, together with Bernardine, was accused of heresy on this account. In 1429, these Observant friars were called to Rome to answer charges of heresy, and John was chosen by his companions to speak for them. They were both acquitted by the Commission of Cardinals appointed to judge the accusations.

He was frequently deployed to embassies by Popes Eugene IV and Nicholas V: in 1439, he was sent as legate to Milan and Burgundy, to oppose the claims of the Antipope Felix V; in 1446, he was on a mission to the King of France; in 1451 he went at the request of the emperor as Apostolic Nuncio to Austria. During the period of his nunciature, John visited all parts of the Empire. As legate, or inquisitor, he persecuted the last Fraticelli of Ferrara, the Jesuati of Venice, the Crypto-Jews of Sicily, Moldavia and Poland, and, above all, the Hussites of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia; his aim in the last case was to make talks impossible between the representatives of Rome and Bohemian &quot;Hussite king&quot; George of Podiebrad, for every attempt at conciliation seemed to him to be conniving at heresy.

He also worked for the reform of the Order of Friars Minor. He upheld, in his writings, speeches and sermons, theories of papal supremacy rather than the theological wranglings of councils (see Conciliar Movement). John, together with his teacher, Bernardine, his colleague, James of the Marche, and Albert Berdini of Sarteano, are considered the four great pillars of the Observant reform among the Friars Minor.

==Anti-Jewish incitement==
John&#x27;s legacy has been made controversial by his contributions to antisemitism in Europe. Known as the &quot;Scourge of the Jews&quot;, he saw it as an act of love to preach against Judaism because it did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. In 1450, the Franciscan &quot;Jew-baiter&quot; arranged a forced disputation at Rome with a certain Gamaliel called &quot;Synagogæ Romanæ magister&quot;. Between 1451 and 1453, his fiery sermons against Jews persuaded many southern German regions to expel their entire Jewish populations. However, “[t]hat in dealing with heretics and Jews he transgressed established bounds and thereby failed against Christian charity is a thought practically unknown to contemporaries. He was at times censured as impractical, but never as uncharitable or inhuman. Even Doering, one of his severest critics, finds nothing to blame in Capistrano’s behavior toward the Jews.”

==The Soldier Priest==

After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Mehmed II, threatened Christian Europe. That following year Pope Callixtus III sent John, who was already aged 70, to preach a Crusade against the invading Ottomans at the Imperial Diet of Frankfurt. Gaining little response in Bavaria and Austria, he decided to concentrate his efforts in Hungary. By July 1456, Capistrano managed to raise a large, albeit poorly trained force made up of peasants and local countryside landlords, with which he advanced towards Belgrade which was under siege by Turkish forces. Though poorly equipped they were highly motivated. Capistrano and John Hunyadi traveled together, though commanding the army separately. Between them, they had gathered around 40,000–50,000 troops altogether.

Hunyadi managed to break the naval blockade on the Danube, and breach the siege, bringing reinforcements and supplies to the city. By some accounts, the peasant soldiers started a spontaneous action, and forced Capistrano and Hunyadi to take advantage of it. Despite Hunyadi&#x27;s orders to the defenders not to try to loot the Ottoman positions, some of the units crept out from demolished ramparts, took up positions across from the Ottoman line, and began harassing enemy soldiers. Ottoman Sipahis tried without success to disperse the harassing force. As more defenders joined those outside the wall, what began as an isolated incident quickly escalated into a full-scale battle.

John of Capistrano at first tried to order his men back inside the walls, but soon found himself surrounded by about 2,000 peasant levymen. He then began leading them toward the Ottoman rear across the Sava river. At the same time, Hunyadi started a desperate charge out of the fort to take the cannon positions in the Ottoman encampment. In the aftermath of a fierce battle, the Ottomans withdrew and retreated under cover of darkness; the siege was lifted. His involvement led to Capistrano being called &quot;the Soldier Priest&quot;. Although he survived the battle, John fell victim to the bubonic plague, which flourished in the unsanitary conditions prevailing among armies of the day. He died on 23 October 1456 at the nearby town of Ilok (now a Croatian border town on the Danube).

==Sainthood and feast day==
The year of John of Capistrano&#x27;s canonization was liturgically celebrated 16 October 1690 by Pope Alexander VIII. The Bull of Canonization, &quot;Rationis Congruit&quot;, was published on 4 June 1724 by Pope Benedict XIII.

In 1890, his feast day was included for the first time in the General Roman Calendar and assigned to 28 March. In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved his feast day to 23 October, the day of his death. Where Mass and the Office are said according to the 1962 Roman Missal and its concomitant calendar, his feast day remains on March 28.

==Eponym of missions==
As a Franciscan reformer preaching simplicity, John became the eponym of two Spanish missions founded by the Franciscan friars in the north of the then-Spanish Americas: Mission San Juan Capistrano in present-day San Juan Capistrano, California, and another Mission San Juan Capistrano just outside the city center of present-day San Antonio, Texas.

==Patron saint==
He is the patron saint of military chaplains and jurists.

<text>Vampire is an automatic theorem prover for first-order classical logic developed in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. Up to Version 3, it was developed by Andrei Voronkov together with Kryštof Hoder and previously with Alexandre Riazanov. Since Version 4, the development has involved a wider international team including Laura Kovacs, Giles Reger, and Martin Suda. Since 1999 it has won at least 53 trophies in the CADE ATP System Competition, the &quot;world cup for theorem provers&quot;, including the most prestigious FOF division and the theory-reasoning TFA division.

==Background==
Vampire&#x27;s kernel implements the calculi of ordered binary resolution and superposition (for handling equality). The splitting rule and negative equality splitting can be simulated by the introduction of new predicate definitions and dynamic folding of such definitions. A DPLL-style algorithm splitting is also supported. A number of standard redundancy criteria and simplification techniques are used for pruning the search space: tautology deletion, subsumption resolution, rewriting by ordered unit equalities, basicness restrictions and irreducibility of substitution terms. 
The reduction ordering on terms is the standard Knuth–Bendix ordering.

A number of efficient indexing techniques are used to implement all major operations on sets of terms and clauses. Run-time algorithm specialisation is used to accelerate forward matching.

Although the kernel of the system works only with conjunctive normal forms, the preprocessor component accepts a problem in the full first-order logic syntax, it and performs a number of useful transformations before passing the result to the kernel. When a theorem is proven, the system produces a verifiable proof, which validates both the phase and the refutation of the conjunctive normal form.

Along with proving theorems, Vampire has other related functionalities such as generating interpolants.

Executables can be obtained from the system website. As of November 2020, Vampire is released under a modified version of the BSD 3-clause licence that explicitly permits commercial use. Previous versions were available under a proprietary non-commercial licence.

<doc id="720410" wikidata="Q2039477" url="?curid=720410" title="Dark chess">
<text>Dark chess (also known as Fog of War chess) is a chess variant with incomplete information, similar to Kriegspiel. It was invented by Jens Bæk Nielsen and Torben Osted in 1989. A player does not see the entire board – only their own pieces and the squares that they can legally move to.

== Rules ==
The goal of this chess variant is not to checkmate the king, but to capture it. A player is not told if their king is in check. Failing to move out of check, or moving into check, are both legal, and can obviously result in a capture and loss of the game.

Each player views a different version of the board, on which they can only see their own pieces, and the squares where these pieces can legally move, as well as any opponent pieces on those squares (which must therefore be capturable). It is indicated to the player which squares are hidden, so a hidden square can never be confused with a visible empty square. As an example, it is always clear when an enemy piece is directly in front of a pawn, because that square will be hidden (as capturing it is not a legal move for the pawn to make).

&quot;En passant&quot; capture is allowed; the threatened pawn and the square it moved through are both visible to the capturing player, but only until the end of the turn. Unlike standard chess, castling is allowed out of check, into check, and through the positions attacked by enemy pieces.

This chess variant is best played on online chess servers. In September 2020, Dark chess was the most popular variant on Chess.com. For playing over-the-board, three chess sets and a referee are needed, just as in Kriegspiel.

There are some minor differences in the rules on different servers:
* SchemingMind: the player does not see what is in front of their pawns, but knows if the position is occupied or not.
* Chess.com (known as &quot;Fog of War chess&quot;); the player does not see what is in front of their pawns, but knows if the position is occupied or not; pawn promotions remain unknown for the opponent. Before November 5, 2021 when a pawn could be taken en passant, the pawn was not visible, but the en passant square was lit up.

== Variations ==
Generally, because basic Dark chess rules are universal with respect to its &quot;parent&quot; classical variant, any 2-player chess variant may be played &quot;in dark&quot;. SchemingMind provides some of the variations.
* Dark chess (checkmate) – standard rules of check apply (a player is notified when its king is in check, and the king cannot move into check). The goal in this variation is the same as in standard chess — to checkmate the king.
* Dark chess (check) – a player is notified when the king is in check, but the king can remain in check after a move. The goal in this variation is the same as in standard dark chess – to capture the king.
* Dark crazyhouse – combination of crazyhouse and dark chess.
* Dark suicide – combination of suicide and dark chess.
* Sun Tzu chess – combination of Double Fischer Random Chess (like Chess960, but with different positions for White and Black), crazyhouse and dark chess. Pieces can be dropped onto any possible square on the board (like crazyhouse). This chess variant was invented in 2005 by John Kipling Lewis.
* Lao Tzu chess – like Sun Tzu, but pieces can only be dropped on seen squares. Also invented in 2005 by John Kipling Lewis.
* Dark Omega chess – combination of Omega Chess and dark chess.
* Dark Seirawan chess – combination of Seirawan chess and dark chess.

== Gameplay ==
Dark chess has a strong strategic flavor. Planning and strategy, as well as some psychological reasoning, are very important; tactics and move searching are not as important as in standard chess.

In this variant, a king should be carefully protected from very dangerous checks by invisible pieces; castling is essential, as the pawns and rook protect the king from invisible pieces. For a queen the most dangerous pieces are knights, which can attack it without becoming visible.

<text>The India national football team represents India in men&#x27;s international football and is governed by the All India Football Federation.

The team, which is considered as the best team in South Asia, won two gold medals at the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games while finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics. India has never participated in the FIFA World Cup, although they did qualify by default for the 1950 World Cup after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament. The team has also appeared four times in the AFC Asian Cup, Asia&#x27;s top football championship and finished as runners-up in 1964. India also participates in the SAFF Championship, the top regional football competition in South Asia. They have won the tournament record eight times since its inception in 1993.

In the 21st century, besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, India won the Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 editions. India also won the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, by which the team qualified for the Asian Cup after 27 years&#x27; gap.

== History ==
=== Early years (1930s–1940s) ===

The first foreign tour by the Indian football team was to Ceylon in 1933. India beat Ceylon 1–0 in first match of the tour. Though it was an All-Bengal team, it was an Indian team by all means.

The second known official international tour of the Indian team, which at that time consisted of both Indian and British players, was to South Africa in 1934 when it was led by Indian footballer Gostha Pal.

The football team of the Muhammadan Sporting Club Calcutta visited Ceylon in 1935.

Football teams consisting of entirely Indian players started to tour Australia, Japan, Indonesia, and Thailand during the late 1930s.

In the year 1938, India carried out a lengthy tour of Australia at the request of the Australian Football Association. From August to October, they played 17 matches against various state, district, and club teams, and 5 friendly matches against the Australian national team. The first of these, on 3 September in Sydney, is India&#x27;s first international game to be recognised by FIFA, and ended in a 5–3 defeat. After drawing the second match in Brisbane 4–4, India won the third match at Newcastle 4–1 to claim their first international win.

The national team played their first match as an independent nation in the first round of the 1948 Summer Olympics against France, in a 2–1 defeat. Famously, the Indian team did not wear boots, playing either barefoot or in socks, something that would be banned by FIFA later in the year.

=== Golden years (1950s–1960s) ===

In 1950, India managed to qualify for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, which was scheduled to take place in Brazil, after all the other teams in their qualifying group withdrew. However, India themselves withdrew from the tournament shortly before it began; officially, this was due to travel costs, but FIFA had offered to pay the team&#x27;s travel expenses, and the real reason behind their withdrawal has been widely speculated in the decades since. While it was commonly believed that India withdrew due to FIFA&#x27;s ban on playing barefoot, the team&#x27;s captain at that time, Sailen Manna, insisted that this was not the case; it is now generally accepted that India withdrew simply because they valued the Olympics more than the World Cup and did not view the latter is being prestigious enough to justify taking part. Since then, India have yet to qualify for another World Cup.

Despite not participating in the World Cup in 1950 and opting not to even play the Asian zone qualifiers until 1985, the following years until 1964 are usually considered to be the &quot;golden era&quot; of the Indian football. India, coached by Hyderabad City Police head coach Syed Abdul Rahim, became one of the best teams in Asia. In March 1951, Rahim led India to their first ever triumph during the 1951 Asian Games, hosted in India. The team defeated Iran 1–0 in the gold medal match to win their first trophy. Sahu Mewalal scored the winning goal for India in that match. The following year, India competed in the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, but were unused to the cold conditions and lost 10–1 to Yugoslavia. Following this defeat, the AIFF made it mandatory for footballers to wear boots. After taking the defeat in Helsinki Finland, India participated in various minor tournaments, such as the Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament, which they won four times from 1952 to 1955.

In 1954, India returned to the Asian Games as defending champions in Manila. Despite their achievement three years prior, India was unable to go past the group stage as the team finished second in Group C during the tournament, two points behind Indonesia. Two years later, at the 1956 Summer Olympics, India went on to achieve the team&#x27;s greatest result in a competitive tournament. The team finished in fourth place during the Summer Olympics football tournament, losing the bronze-medal match to Bulgaria 3–0. The tournament is also known for Neville D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s hat-trick against Australia in the quarterfinals. D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s hat-trick was the first scored by an Asian in Olympic history. India defeated Australia by 4–2 in that match at the Olympic Park Stadium.

After their good performance during the Summer Olympics, India participated in the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo. The team once again finished fourth, losing the bronze-medal match to Indonesia 4–1. The next year the team travelled to Malaysia where they took part in the 1959 Merdeka tournament and finished as the tournament runners-up.

India began the 1960s with the 1960 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Despite the qualifiers for the West Zone being held in Kochi, India finished last in their qualification group and thus missed out the tournament. Despite the set-back, India went on to win the gold medal during the Asian Games for the second time in 1962. The team defeated South Korea 2–1 to win their second major championship.

Two years later, following their Asian Games triumph, India participated in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup after all the other teams in their qualification group withdrew. Despite their automatic entry into the continental tournament, India team managed to finish as the runners-up during the tournament, losing out to the hosts, Israel, by two points. This remains India&#x27;s best performance in the AFC Asian Cup.

=== Decline (1970s–2000) ===

India returned to the Asian Games in 1966. Despite their performance two years prior during the AFC Asian Cup, India could not go beyond the group stage as the team finished third, behind Japan and Iran. Four years later, during the 1970 Asian Games, India came back and took third place during the tournament. The team defeated Japan 1–0 during the bronze-medal match.

In 1974, India&#x27;s performance in the Asian Games once again sharply declined as they finished the 1974 edition in last place in their group, losing all three matches, scoring two, and conceding 14 goals in the first round. India then showed steady improvement during the 1978 tournament, finishing second in their group of three. The team were then knocked-out in the next round, finishing last in their group with three defeats from three matches. The 1982 tournament proved to be better for India as the side managed to qualify for the quarter-finals before losing to Saudi Arabia 1–0.
In 1984, India managed to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time since their second place triumph in 1964. During the 1984 tournament, India finished in last place in their five team group in the first round. India&#x27;s only non-defeat during the tournament came against Iran, a 0–0 draw.

Despite India&#x27;s decline from a major football power in Asia, the team still managed to assert its dominance as the top team in South Asia. India managed to win the football competition of the South Asian Games in 1985 and then again won the gold medal in 1987. The team then began the 1990s by winning the inaugural SAFF Championship in 1993 and silver medal at the 1993 South Asian Games. In February 1996, India achieved its highest FIFA ranking of 94, under Bhaichung Bhutia&#x27;s captaincy. The team ended the 20th century by winning the SAFF Championship again in 1997 and 1999.

=== Resurgence (2001–2011) ===

India&#x27;s first competitive matches of the 21st century were the 2002 FIFA World Cup first round qualifiers. India took a very bright start, defeating the United Arab Emirates 1–0, drawing Yemen 1–1, as well as two victories over Brunei, including a 5–0 victory in Bangalore. However, they finished a point away from qualification for the next round. In 2003, India took part in the 2003 SAFF Championship. The team qualified for the semi-finals but fell to Bangladesh 2–1.

Later in 2003, India participated in the Afro-Asian Games being held in Hyderabad. Under the coaching of Stephen Constantine, India managed to make it to the final of the tournament after defeating Zimbabwe, a team ranked 85 places above India in the FIFA rankings at the time, 5–3. Despite the major victory, during the gold-medal match India were defeated 1–0 by Uzbekistan. Because of this achievement, Constantine was voted as the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s Manager of the Month for October 2003. The tournament result also gave India more recognition around the country and around the world.
Constantine was replaced by Syed Nayeemuddin in 2005 but the Indian head coach only lasted for a little over a year as India suffered many heavy defeats during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. During this time India were defeated 6–0 by Japan, 3–0 by Saudi Arabia and Yemen respectively at home, and 7–1 away in Jeddah. Former Malmö and China coach Bob Houghton was brought in as head coach in May 2006.

Under Houghton, India witnessed massive improvement in their football standing. In August 2007, Houghton won the country the restarted Nehru Cup after India defeated Syria 1–0 in the final. Pappachen Pradeep scored the winning goal for India that match. The next year, Houghton led India during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, which was hosted in Hyderabad and Delhi. During the tournament, India breezed through the group stage before defeating Myanmar in the semi-finals. In the final against Tajikistan, India, through a Sunil Chhetri hat-trick, won the match 4–1. The victory not only earned India the championship but it also allowed India to qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, the nation&#x27;s first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years. In order to prepare for the Asian Cup, Houghton had the team stay together as a squad for eight months from June 2010 until the start of the tournament, meaning the players would not play for their clubs.

India were drawn into Group C for the Asian Cup with Australia, South Korea, and Bahrain. Even though they stayed together as a team for eight months, India lost all three of their matches during the Asian Cup, including a 4–0 defeat to Australia. Despite the results, India were praised by fans and pundits for their valiant efforts during the tournament.

=== Recent history (2011–2018) ===

After participating the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, India&#x27;s campaign to qualify for the 2015 Asian Cup began in February 2011 with the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. Bob Houghton decided to change the makeup of the India squad, replacing many of the older players from the Asian Cup with some young players from the AIFF development side in the I-League, Indian Arrows. Even with a young side, India managed to qualify for the AFC Challenge Cup. Despite qualifying for the AFC Challenge Cup, the AIFF decided to terminate the contract of Bob Houghton as he was charged with racial abuse towards referee which ultimately resulted in his resignation as the head coach of India.

After having Dempo coach Armando Colaco as interim head coach, the AIFF signed Savio Medeira as head coach in October 2011. Medeira led India to another SAFF Championship victory, but also to their worst performance in the AFC Challenge Cup in March 2012. The team lost all three of their group matches, unable to score a single goal during the tournament. After the tournament, Medeira was replaced as head coach by Dutchman, Wim Koevermans. Koevermans&#x27; first job as head coach was the 2012 Nehru Cup. India won their third successive Nehru Cup, defeating Cameroon on penalties.

In March 2013, India failed to qualify for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup and thus also failed to qualify for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. The team also failed to retain the SAFF Championship, losing 2–0 to Afghanistan in the 2013 final. After more bad results in friendlies, Koevermans resigned as head coach in October 2014.

By March 2015, after not playing any matches, India reached their lowest FIFA ranking position of 173. A couple months prior, Stephen Constantine was re-hired as the head coach after first leading India more than a decade before. Constantine&#x27;s first major assignment back as the India head coach were the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After making it through the first round of qualifiers, India crashed out during the second round, losing seven of their eight matches and thus, once again, failed to qualify for the World Cup.

Despite failure to qualify for the World Cup, India managed to reach the third round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers after defeating Laos in the play-off round on aggregate 7–1. On 11 October 2017, India secured qualification for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after a 4–1 victory over Macau. In 2017, India remained undefeated by drawing two and winning seven games, which helped the team to reach 96 in the FIFA ranking in May, which is its second highest FIFA rank ever.

Though defeated at the 2018 SAFF Championship final 1–2 against Maldives in September 2018, India regained the momentum with some friendlies against China, Jordan and Oman as they began the 2019 AFC Asian Cup with a 4–1 victory against Thailand; this was their biggest ever win at the Asia Cup, and their first in 55 years. Nevertheless, they lost both of their next two group matches against UAE and Bahrain 0−2 and 0−1 respectively and finished at the bottom of the group, thus failed to move to knock out stage. Stephen Constantine immediately resigned from his position as head coach following the failure to progress further in the tournament.

===Igor Stimac era (2019–2024)===

On 15 May 2019, the AIFF announced former Croatian player and coach Igor Štimac as the team&#x27;s head coach after the departure of Stephen Constantine. His first major assignment with India was 2022 World Cup qualification, where it began with a 1–2 home loss to Oman. But in the second match they earned a respectable point after managing a goalless draw against the 2019 Asian Champion and 2022 FIFA World Cup host Qatar. However, in the third match, the home leg against Bangladesh saw them managing a disappointing 1−1 draw. A similar result was repeated in the away leg against Afghanistan. In the away leg, India lost yet again to Oman by a solitary goal, thus shortening their hopes to qualify for the next round. After several postponements due to COVID-19, the team finally flew to Doha to play their remainder of games. In the return leg against Qatar, India went down to the hosts with a single goal and got knocked out of the World Cup qualification tournament with two games to spare. The team then made a comeback by winning their next match against Bangladesh 2–0, and ended their campaign with a 1–1 draw against Afghanistan. With seven points in total, India finished third on the table behind Qatar and Oman, thus getting eliminated from the World Cup during the second round. However they were qualified into the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification.

In the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, India was drawn in the same group with Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Cambodia. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, India was chosen as the host of the group of the qualifiers while the qualification was reduced into a single round robin format. Using this home advantage, India was able to top the group with three wins against Cambodia (2–0), Afghanistan (2–1) and Hong Kong (4–0), therefore for the first time, India qualified for two consecutive AFC Asian Cups in history. In September 2022, India participated for the first time in the VFF Cup where they played two friendly matches, a 1–1 draw against Singapore and a 3–0 defeat by Vietnam, ending their year . In 2023, India began their campaign by winning the 2023 Tri-Nation Series and the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, both were organized by AIFF. India beat Myanmar 1–0 and Kyrgyzstan 2–0 in the Tri-Nation series, and defeated Lebanon 2–0 in the final of Intercontinental Cup to win the title for the second time. Following the Tri-Nation Series and the Intercontinental Cup, India won the 2023 SAFF championship, their third title in the year 2023 at home soil. India defeated Pakistan 4–0 and Nepal 2–0 and drawn 1–1 against Kuwait in the group stage. After defeating Lebanon in penalty shoot-out in the semi–finals, India faced Kuwait again in the tournament for the final. The match was tied 1–1 till the added time and eventually India defeated Kuwait in the penalty shoot-out to lift the SAFF Cup for a record nine times. Sunil Chhetri was the highest goal scorer of the edition with 5 goals, including a hat-trick against Pakistan, his fourth for the national team. With this hat-trick, he scored 92 goals becoming the second-highest international goalscorer from Asia of all time. His tally of 92 put him as the fourth-highest goalscorer in the history of international football.

Heading to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup tournament, India was the only national team without any friendly match as preparation. India ended up losing all matches in the group stage against Australia (0–2), Uzbekistan (0–3), and Syria (0–1), without scoring any goals.

On the 2026 World Cup qualification India was drawn in group A of the second round with Afghanistan, Kuwait and Qatar. India started its journey topping the group with Qatar after winning against Kuwait 1–0, in which ended up being the only victory of the team in the group. Since then the performances only got downhill, collecting losses against Qatar (0–3 and 1—2) and a shocking loss against Afghanistan 1–2, with the other two results left being draws against Kuwait and Afghanistan, both ending up 0–0. India finished the group placed third behind Qatar and Kuwait and failed to qualify for the next round.

On 17 June 2024, the AIFF terminated Stimac&#x27;s contract, thus ending up his career with The Blue Tigers.

=== Márquez appointment (2024–) ===
On 20 July 2024, the AIFF announced that Manolo Márquez would become the head coach of the India national football team while maintaining his duties with FC Goa for the upcoming ISL season. His first assignment was the 2024 Intercontinental Cup against Mauritius and Syria.

== Team image ==
=== Nicknames ===
India is officially known by the nickname &quot;The Blue Tigers&quot; since 2013. It is inspired by the colour blue which forms the primary colour of the team&#x27;s home kit, depicting Ashoka Chakra&#x27;s colour in the national flag (similar to the Indian national teams of other sports) and the tiger which is the national animal of India.

=== Kit and colours ===

The success of the India cricket team and field hockey teams in blue jerseys made the colour more prominent. The football team, however, has used some sort of shade of blue for decades.

At the turn of the 21st century, India wore a sky blue shirt with black shorts and sky blue socks as their kit. In 2002, the All India Football Federation signed a deal with German manufacturer Adidas to produce the India kit. The first kit made by Adidas was all-white. After four years with Adidas, the AIFF signed an agreement for seven years with American company Nike on 27 February 2006. Nike&#x27;s first kits for India were in darker blue while the away kit was changed from white to orange. For the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, in which India were participating, Nike designed India&#x27;s kit using the same template it used for other national teams such as Brazil. In January 2013. it was announced that the AIFF&#x27;s deal with Nike was extended for an extra five years. In September 2017, prior to the India U17 side&#x27;s participation in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, Nike unveiled an all sky blue kit for the India senior and youth teams. A year later, on 17 December 2018, it was announced that Indian manufacturer SIX5SIX would replace Nike as India&#x27;s kit maker. In becoming India&#x27;s new kit makers, Six5Six also became the first manufacturer to pay for the rights to produce India kits, after both Nike and Adidas didn&#x27;t pay. Six5Six unveiled their first jerseys for the team before the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, from which the home colour had a similar sky blue shade and the away colour was changed to white from orange. Both jerseys had a unique design embellished on the sleeves representing tiger stripes to pay homage to the Indian football fans, who affectionately calls the team &quot;Blue Tigers&quot;.

=== Home stadiums ===

Numerous venues around India have hosted home matches for the national team. There is no specific home ground for the India national team. India matches have been played at stadiums such as the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, the Fatorda Stadium in Margao, the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bangalore, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi, the Mumbai Football Arena in Mumbai, the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati, the Khuman Lampak Main Stadium in Imphal, the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar and the EKA Arena in Ahmedabad.

In recent times, competitions like 2011 SAFF Championship and 2012 Nehru Cup were held at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, the 2015 SAFF Championship at Trivandrum International Stadium, 2017 Hero Tri-Nation Series and 2018 Intercontinental Cup at Mumbai Football Arena and 2019 Intercontinental Cup at the EKA Arena. Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium, Sree Kanteerava Stadium and Fatorda stadium have seen AFC Asian Cup and FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

=== Supporters ===
Till the 21st century, the Indian football fans were mostly scattered, being widely based in West Bengal, North-East India, Goa and Kerala. Other than matches in Asian Games, Nehru Cup or SAFF Championship, the crowd showed up in small numbers when the team played as the fans were not organised under any single banner as happens in Europe or South America. Fans of different clubs used to support the team in their respective local venues but were not grouped together to support a single cause, that of the national team, until 2017 when &quot;Blue Pilgrims&quot; was established as the first organised fan club for the national team.

The Blue Pilgrims formed with a motive to support the national team and the U-17 team during the historic 2017 U17 World Cup, India&#x27;s first ever FIFA competition participation. Started with 300 odd fans, now they are in thousands as a unification of fans from different regions with different allegiances came together for just one cause, the Blue Tigers. They call themselves the devotees of the Blue Tigers, and their motto is to support India national football teams of all gender and age, wherever they play and for such dedication they are called as the 12th man of the team.
The Blue Pilgrims&#x27;s most common chants are: &quot;Oh India!&quot;, &quot;In Unity we stand&quot;, &quot;Oh India we stand for you!&quot;, &quot;Vande Mataram&quot;. Their sports anthems are &quot;Oh when the blues go marching in, I wanna be in that number!&quot; and &quot;Hum honge kaamyab&quot; (We shall overcome). Since its formation, the Blue Pilgrims use to celebrate after every match with Viking clap with the national team members. Fans of the India national team display the country&#x27;s tricolour National flag and also wear blue jerseys in solidarity with the team. They used to display their banner &quot;Blue Pilgrims&quot; along with &quot;Inquilab-e-Indian football&quot; (Revolution of Indian football) and often shout their common slogan, &quot;We love you, wherever you go, we follow!&quot;&quot;. On 2 June 2018, the then captain Sunil Chhetri posted a video on social media. In his video he urged the fans to come out at Mumbai to support the team after a poor crowd appearance of only 2569 at a match against Chinese Taipei in the 2018 Intercontinental Cup. India achieved a massive victory in that match, winning by 5−0 with Chhetri scoring a hat-trick, but there were very few people present to celebrate. Responding to the captain&#x27;s call, the Blue Pilgrims and football supporters including the fan clubs like Manjappada, West Block Blues and East Bengal Ultras made sure that the stadiums were full during the next few matches. In the final of that tournament, the Blue Pilgrims displayed a tall 3D tifo of a Blue Tiger, the first ever in the team&#x27;s history.

=== Media coverage ===

India&#x27;s competitive international games are covered on television by Star Sports and on its OTT service, Hotstar. Prior to this deal, the AIFF had struck a ten-year deal with Zee Sports in 2006 to broadcast Indian national team&#x27;s games on its channel with the initiative of &quot; &#x27;Goal 2010&#x27; &quot;. The aim of this whole exercise was to help India qualify for the 2010 World Cup.

=== Coaching history ===
Since India&#x27;s independence, there have been twenty-nine different head coaches for the national team, out of which eleven foreign. The most successful head coach for India was Syed Abdul Rahim, who led India to gold in both the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games while also achieving a fourth-place finish during the 1956 Summer Olympics. The most successful foreign head coaches for India were Bob Houghton and Stephen Constantine; both of them helped the team to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. With Houghton in charge from 2006 to 2011, India won the Nehru Cup twice and the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008, which allowed them to participate in their first AFC Asian Cup for 27 years. Since Houghton resigned as head coach in 2011, the Indian national team&#x27;s FIFA ranking touched its lowest at 173 in the team history in March 2015, but Constantine, who was appointed for the second time as the head coach of India, revived the Indian team from its meagre condition. Under him, the team remained unbeaten for two years from June 2016 to March 2018 winning 11 matches and drawn 2 matches, which helped them to qualify for 2019 AFC Asian Cup, 8 years since Houghton left. He also helped the team to reach a better FIFA ranking of 96 in July 2017, which was the best in last 21 years.

===Notable players===
During the early 20th century, India produced one of the best footballers from Asia at that time, Gostha Pal. Pal began playing professional football at the age of 16 in 1911, becoming India&#x27;s first captain, and was considered one of the best defenders India had ever produced. He was also the first footballer to be awarded Padma Shree in the year 1962, and in 1998, the Government of India introduced a postal stamp in his honour. In the later 1930s, players like R. Lumsden, Noor Mohammed, T. Rahim, K. Prosad, A. Nandi under the leadership of Karuna Bhattacharya played for India who scored a total of 56 goals in 17 matches during the 1938 Australia tour out of which 5 matches were against Australia, where Lumsden scored the first international hat-trick for India.
India&#x27;s first captain after the country gained independence was Dr. Talimeren Ao. At a very young age, using footballs made out of rags, Ao gradually improved his skills as a defensive midfielder. He was given the responsibility of leading the team at the 1948 Olympics, India&#x27;s first major tournament and also was the flag bearer of Indian contingents in London. Also during this era, India produced Sailen Manna, one of the country&#x27;s best defenders. He was given the India captaincy in 1951 during the Asian Games, led the team to the gold medal, India&#x27;s first major international honour, and also captained the team during the 1952 Olympics and 1954 Asian Games. In 1953, England Football Association rated Manna among &quot;10 Best Skippers of the World&quot; in its yearbook, the Government of India awarded him Padma Shri in 1971 and AIFF honoured him as &quot;AIFF Player-of-the-Millennium&quot; in 2000.

During India&#x27;s golden era between the 1950s and early 60s, the country produced coveted strikers such as Sheoo Mewalal, Neville D&#x27;Souza, Chuni Goswami, Inder Singh and Tulsidas Balaram. Mewalal was India&#x27;s starting striker during the 1948 Olympics, 1952 Olympics and 1951 Asian games where he ended as the tournament top goalscorer with four goals. Mewalal was the first Indian player to score a hat-trick since the country gained independence when he scored it against Burma during the 1952 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament. D&#x27;Souza meanwhile became the first Asian player to score a hat-trick at the Olympic Games, scoring a hat-trick against Australia during the 1956 Olympics. D&#x27;Souza also tied for top goalscorer in that edition of the Olympics, which helped India reach the semi-finals. Goswami represented India at the 1958 Asian Games and the 1960 Olympics, and captained the side during the 1962 Asian Games and the 1964 Asian Cup. He was bestowed with Padma Shri by the Government of India and AFC honoured him as &quot;Best Striker of Asia&quot; in 1962.

P. K. Banerjee, a winger who represented India at the 1956 Olympics and later captained the side during the 1960 Olympics, was named as the best &quot;Indian player of the 20th Century&quot;. Peter Thangaraj was the starting goalkeeper for India during the later stage of India&#x27;s golden era, being named as best &quot;Indian keeper of the 20th Century&quot; by IFFHS. P. K. Banerjee was honoured with Padma Shri by Government of India in 1990, and in 2004 FIFA bestowed him with &quot;FIFA Centennial Order of Merit&quot; Award, the highest honour awarded by FIFA.

From the 1970s to the 2000s, India saw a decline in their results. Despite the lack of tournament victories, the country managed to produce players like Syed Nayeemuddin who led India to bronze at the 1970 Asian Games. During the 1990s, I. M. Vijayan, India&#x27;s best player at the time, was capped 72 times for India while scoring 29 goals and captaining the team several times.
In 1995, Bhaichung Bhutia debuted for India. With Bhutia, India qualified for the AFC Asian Cup after a drought of 27 years. He was the captain of the team for over ten years. Considered one of the greatest footballers of India, he is the second-most-capped player of India with 84 caps and scored 27 times for India. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2008 and IFFHS listed him among the legendary players of football in 2016.
Under Bhutia&#x27;s captaincy Sunil Chhetri debuted for India who is now the only footballer in India&#x27;s history to have played 100 international matches and is the all-time highest goal-scorer of India. Chhetri led the national team to many victories, most importantly qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup and under his leadership the team achieved its highest FIFA ranking of 96 after twenty-one years. His goal-scoring ability and skills made him the only Indian striker to score four hat-tricks for India. Sunil Chhetri is now the third-highest international goalscorer among active players, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, but fourth overall, and is also the most-capped player and the all-time top goalscorer of the India national team.

== Competitive record ==
=== FIFA World Cup ===

India has never played in the finals of the FIFA World Cup. After gaining independence in 1947, India managed to qualify for the World Cup held in 1950. This was due to Myanmar, Indonesia, and the Philippines withdrawing from qualification round. However, prior to the start of the tournament, India themselves withdrew due to the expenses required in getting the team to Brazil. But this reason was untrue because FIFA was ready to give money to India (AIFF) for their trip to Brazil. Other reasons cited for why India withdrew include FIFA not allowing Indian players to play in the tournament &quot;barefoot&quot; and the All India Football Federation not considering the FIFA World Cup an important tournament compared to the Olympics, but according to some pundits &quot;barefoot&quot; was a made up story, manufactured by AIFF to stop people asking questions on &quot;why didn&#x27;t India participate in the 1950 FIFA World Cup?&quot;. AIFF did not have confidence in the Indian players then that they would compete in the World Cup against the world&#x27;s top teams and win.

After withdrawing from the 1950 FIFA World Cup, India did not enter the qualifying rounds of the tournament between 1954 and 1982. Since the 1986 qualifiers, with the exception of the 1990 edition of the tournament, the team participated in World Cup qualification, but has yet to qualify for the finals again.

=== AFC Asian Cup ===
India has qualified for the AFC Asian Cup five times. The team played their first Asian Cup in 1964. The team managed to qualify following other nations&#x27; refusal to play against India due to political reasons. India managed to finish the tournament as runners-up to hosts Israel, with Inder Singh finishing as joint top-scorer. Since then India has failed to progress beyond the first round of the Asian Cup with their participation at the 1984 and 2011 Asian Cups, and most recently the 2019 Asian Cup.

In June 2022, India qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup after winning all the matches in the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification. This is the first time ever India qualified consecutively for the continental championship.

=== Summer Olympics ===

India competed in four straight Olympic football tournaments between 1948 and 1960. Their sole 1948 Olympics match against France was also India&#x27;s first ever international match since the country gained independence in 1947. During the match, a majority of the Indian side played barefoot. The match ended in a 2–1 defeat, with Sarangapani Raman scoring the lone goal for India. India then returned to the Olympics four years later where they took on Yugoslavia in the preliminary rounds. The team suffered a 10–1 defeat, India&#x27;s largest margin of defeat in a competitive match, and were knocked out.

Four years later, during the 1956 Olympics, India managed to reach the semi-finals and finish fourth. After India&#x27;s first round opponents, Hungary, withdrew from the tournament, the team played against hosts Australia in the quarter-finals. A Neville D&#x27;Souza hat-trick, the first by an Asian footballer in the Olympics, helped India win 4–2. However, in the semi-finals, India once again suffered defeat against Yugoslavia, going down 4–1. In the bronze medal match, India were defeated 3–0 by Bulgaria.

In 1960, India competed in Group D with Hungary, France and Peru. India ended the group in last place, drawing once. India have since failed to qualify for another Olympic games.

=== Asian Games ===
India competed in eleven Asian Games, starting from 1951 to 1998, except the 1990 and 1994 editions. In 1951 Asian Games India won their first match against Indonesia in the first round and then defeated Japan in semi-final and went on to win against Iran in the final in front of the home crowd. The achievement of the Indian team was a special one as they became the first ever Asian Games gold medalists in football and also the first ever Asian football champions as well.

Though the next two tournaments proved to be less successful for the team, but they bounced back by winning the gold at the 1962 Asian games by defeating the Asian Cup winners South Korea in the final to win their second continental title. The team failed to defend their title in 1966 and went on to claim the bronze medal in 1970.

This was the last time India ever finished on the medal podium, the next years proved to be hard for the Indian team to regain their dominance as the side went through a sharp decline. After two disappointing editions in 1974 and 1978, India performed much better in the 1982 Asiad, which they hosted for the second time by reaching the quarter-finals but lost to Saudi Arabia. Due to the poor performance in 1986 Asian Games the authorities decided not to send the team for the upcoming games. The team made their return in 1998.

===SAFF Championship===
India has played in all editions of the SAFF Championship (except in 2009 when they sent under-23 team) and has been the most successful team in the competition winning an overall eight titles. The team played in the knockout stage of every tournament except in 1993 when the tournament was in a league format. The team also boasts a prestigious record of claiming medal at every championships played so far. India has played in the final of every championship except the 2003 tournament where they claimed bronze medal for the first time.
===AFC Challenge Cup===

India has participated in AFC Challenge Cup two times (They competed in the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup with their U-20 team and with the U-23 team in 2010 AFC Challenge Cup). The tournament was originally created for countries categorized as emerging association, though India was invited to take part by AFC along with other developing association countries like North Korea, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The team won the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup and qualified for the 2011 Asian Cup after 27 years.

===South Asian Games===
India has participated in every editions of every edition of senior football competition at the South Asian Games except in 1984. The team emerged as champions in 1985, 1987 and 1995 .They also took home silver in 1993 and bronze medals in 1989 and 1995.

<doc id="720415" wikidata="Q7840756" url="?curid=720415" title="Trichodesmium">
<text>Trichodesmium, also called sea sawdust, is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria. They are found in nutrient poor tropical and subtropical ocean waters (particularly around Australia and in the Red Sea, where they were first described by Captain Cook). &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is a diazotroph; that is, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, a nutrient used by other organisms. &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally. &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is the only known diazotroph able to fix nitrogen in daylight under aerobic conditions without the use of heterocysts.

&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; can live as individual filaments, with tens to hundreds of cells strung together, or in colonies consisting of tens to hundreds of filaments clustered together. These colonies are visible to the naked eye and sometimes form blooms, which can be extensive on surface waters. These large blooms led to widespread recognition as &quot;sea sawdust/straw&quot;. The Red Sea gets most of its eponymous colouration from the corresponding pigment in &quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot;. Colonies of &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; provide a pseudobenthic substrate for many small oceanic organisms including bacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, protozoa, and copepods (which are its primary predator); in this way, the genus can support complex microenvironments.

==Species==
There are currently 9 accepted species in the genus &quot;Trichodesmium&quot;:
*&quot;Trichodesmium clevei&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium contortum&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium hildebrantii&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium iwanoffianum&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium lacustre&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium lenticulare&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium scoboideum&quot; 
*&quot;Trichodesmium thiebautii&quot; 

&quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot;, described by Ehrenberg in 1830, is the lectotype of the genus. &quot;T. erythraeum&quot; is the species responsible for discoloring the Red Sea during blooms. This is the only sequenced genome in the genus thus far and is the focus of most laboratory studies (&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; IMS 101).

==Cell structure==
Like most cyanobacteria, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; has a gram negative cell wall. Unlike other diazotrophic, filamentous cyanobacteria, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; do not have heterocysts—structures found in some filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria which protect the enzyme nitrogenase from oxygen. This is a unique characteristic among filamentous cyanobacteria which fix nitrogen in daylight. Photosynthesis occurs using phycoerythrin – light-harvesting phycobiliprotein which is normally found within heterocysts in other diazotrophs.

Instead of having localized stacks of thylakoids, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; has unstacked thylakoids found throughout the cell. &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is highly vacuolated and the content and size of the vacuoles shows diurnal variation. Large gas vesicles (either along the periphery as seen in &quot;T. erythaeum&quot; or found distributed throughout the cell as seen in &quot;T. thiebautii&quot;) allow &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; to regulate buoyancy in the water column. These gas vesicles can withstand high pressure, presumably those up to 100–200 m in the water column, allowing &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; to move vertically through the water column harvesting nutrients.

==Nitrogen fixation==
N2 is the most abundant chemical in the atmosphere. However, diatomic nitrogen is not usable for most biological processes. Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting atmospheric diatomic nitrogen into biologically usable forms of nitrogen such as ammonium and nitrogen oxides. This process requires a substantial amount of energy (in the form of ATP) in order to break the triple bond between the nitrogen atoms.

&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is the major diazotroph in marine pelagic systems and is an important source of &quot;new&quot; nitrogen in the nutrient poor waters it inhabits. It has been estimated that the global input of nitrogen fixation by &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is approximately 60–80 Tg (megatonnes or 1012 grams) N per year. Nitrogen fixation in &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is unique among diazotrophs because the process occurs concurrently with oxygen production (via photosynthesis). In other cyanobacteria, N2 and CO2 reduction are separated either in space (using heterocysts to protect the sensitive nitrogenase enzyme from oxygen) or time. However, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; lacks heterocysts and nitrogen fixation peaks during daylight hours (following a diel flux initiated in the morning, reaching a maximum fixation rate midday, and ceasing activity at night). Since the first realization of this enigma, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; has been the focus of many studies to try and discover how nitrogen fixation is able to occur in the presence of oxygen production without any apparent structure separating the two processes.

Inhibitor studies even revealed that photosystem II activity is essential for nitrogen fixation in this organism. All this may seem contradictory at first glance, because the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase, is irreversibly inhibited by oxygen. However, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; utilises photosynthesis for nitrogen fixation by carrying out the Mehler reaction, during which the oxygen produced by PSII is reduced again after PSI. This regulation of photosynthesis for nitrogen fixation involves rapidly reversible coupling of their light-harvesting antenna, the phycobilisomes, with PSI and PSII.

==Ecology==


&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is found in oligotrophic waters, often when waters are calm and the mixed layer depth is shallow (around 100 m).
&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is found primarily in water between 20 and 34 °C and is frequently encountered in tropical and sub-tropical oceans in western boundary currents. Its presence is more pronounced in nitrogen poor water and can easily be seen when blooms form, trapping large &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; colonies at the surface.

As a diazotroph, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; contributes a large portion of the marine ecosystem&#x27;s new nitrogen, estimated to produce between 60 and 80 Tg of nitrogen per year. Nitrogen fixed by &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; can either be used directly by the cell, enter the food chain through grazers, be released into dissolved pools, or get exported to the deep sea.

Compared to eukaryotic phytoplankton, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; has a slow growth rate, which has been hypothesized to be an adaptation to survival in high energy but low nutrient conditions of oligotrophic waters. Growth rate is limited by iron and phosphate concentrations in the water. In order to obtain these limiting nutrients, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is able to regulate buoyancy using its gas vacuole and move vertically throughout the water column, harvesting nutrients.

===Colonies===
Various species of &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; have been described based on morphology and structure of colonies formed. Colonies may consist of aggregates of several to several hundred trichomes and form fusiform (called &quot;Tufts&quot;) colonies when aligned in parallel, or spherical (called &quot;Puffs&quot;) colonies when aligned radially.

&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; colonies have been shown to have large degree of associations with other organisms, including bacteria, fungi, diatoms, copepods, tunicates, hydrozoans, and protozoans among other groups. These colonies may provide a source of shelter, buoyancy, and possibly food in the surface waters. Most of these associations appear to be commensal, with the &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; providing substrate and nutrition while deriving no obvious benefit from the organisms dwelling within the colonies.

=== Sociality ===
&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; are able to transfer between living as a single filament and as a colony. These different morphologies impact the way that the &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; interact with the environment. Switching between morphologies shows that there are different benefits and costs of existing in each form, and helps scientists understand why transferring from one form to another is necessary. Trichomes, or free-floating single filaments, have higher rates of nitrogen fixation as opposed to colonies. When iron and phosphorus are limiting in the environment, the filamentous &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; are stimulated to aggregate together to form colonies. Colonies can outcompete trichomes when environmental factors such as predation and rate of respiration for nutrient fixing are at play. The size of the colonies are also linked with the environmental oxygen content, due to the influence of oxygen in the process of photosynthesis.

&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; colonies are microbially diverse and are considered to be a holobiont, where multiple epibiont bacteria form a singular colony. In these holobionts, &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; is the core host, but the microbial diversity of the holobiont colony is an essential part of its ecological interactions. Some examples of the &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; microbiome’s epibiont bacteria include diazotrophs and several cyanobacteria species such as &quot;Richelia&quot;. &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; and the epibiont bacteria within the holobiont colonies may perform mutualistic interactions where limiting nutrients such as iron can be mobilized from dust. Other interactions with organisms arise when trichomes start to accumulate together. When colonies of &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; aggregate in large numbers, it is possible for them to produce a phycotoxin that can affect the growth other microorganisms in the local space of the ocean.

===Blooms===
&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; forms large, visible blooms in the surface waters. Blooms have been described in the Baltic Sea, the Red Sea, the Caribbean Sea, the Indian Ocean, the North and South Atlantic and the North Pacific, and off the coast of Australia. One of the earliest blooms was described by E. Dupont in the Red Sea, noticed for turning the surface of the water a reddish color. This bloom was said to extend about 256 nautical miles. Most blooms are several kilometers long and last one to several months. Blooms can form in coastal or oceanic waters, most frequently when the water has been still for some time and surface temperatures exceed 27 °C.

&quot;Trichodesmium&quot; blooms release carbon, nitrogen and other nutrients into the environment. Some species of &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; have been shown to release toxins which cause mortalities in some copepods, fish, and oysters. Blooms have also been credited with releasing the toxin which causes clupeotoxism in humans after ingesting fish which have bioaccumulated the toxin during &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; blooms. The larger impact of these blooms is likely important to the oceanic ecosystem and is the source of many studies. Blooms are traced and tracked using satellite imaging where the highly reflective gas vacuole makes &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; blooms easily detectable.

It is expected that blooms may increase due to anthropogenic effects in the coming years. Phosphate loading of the environment (through fertilizer pollution, waste disposal, and mariculture) will reduce the growth constraints associated with limited phosphate and likely increase bloom occurrences. Likewise, global warming is projected to increase stratification and cause a shallowing of the mixed layer depth. Both of these factors are associated with &quot;Trichodesmium&quot; blooms and may also cause an increase in the occurrence of blooms in the future.

<text>Inner City (; ) the central part of Budapest. It is more or less equivalent with the historic old town of Pest.

==Location==
The Inner City is situated on the east bank of the river Danube. Until 1949 it was the &quot;4th district&quot; of the town. Since then it has largely comprised the 5th district and the 6th district. The border of the city from the east follows the line of the old city walls, which is the Small Boulevard; its sections are (&quot;Charles Boulevard&quot;), (&quot;Museum Boulevard&quot;) and (&quot;Vámház Boulevard&quot;). The border from the west is the river Danube itself.

A colloquial definition of inner city (or city centre, both with lower case letters) also exists according to which the city centre of Budapest, in a broader sense, is bordered by the Grand Boulevard on Pest side of the city. In Buda (if it is also included), it is bordered by the continuation of Grand Boulevard by &quot;Margit körút (Margaret Boulevard)&quot;, &quot;Krisztina körút (Christina Boulevard)&quot;, &quot;Budaörsi út&quot; (&quot;Budaörsi Street&quot;) and &quot;Bocskai út (Bocskai Street).&quot; So the wider area comprises the whole 5th district and some parts of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and the 13th districts on the Pest side, while also certain parts of the 1st., 2nd, 11th, and the 12th. districts on the Buda side.

=== Parts of the city center ===

==== The City itself ====

* The main part of 5th district (&quot;Belváros,&quot; English&quot;: Inner City&quot;) with Dunakorzó (&quot;Danube Promenade&quot;) in its heart.

==== The surrounding area (clockwise from north) ====

*Lipótváros (English: &quot;Leopold Town)&quot;. It is the other part of the 5th district and the political-financial centre of the town.
*7th district (&quot;Erzsébetváros&quot;, English: &quot;Elisabeth Town&quot;).
*8th district (&quot;Józsefváros&quot;, English: &quot;Joseph Town&quot;)
*9th district (&quot;Ferencváros&quot;, English: &quot;Francis Town&quot;)
*The inner parts of Buda.

<doc id="720421" wikidata="Q523413" url="?curid=720421" title="List of rock genres">
<text>This is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock&#x27;s history.

<doc id="720425" wikidata="Q4296" url="?curid=720425" title="Monarchy of New Zealand">
<text>The monarchy of New Zealand is the constitutional system of government in which a hereditary monarch is the sovereign and head of state of New Zealand. The current monarch is King Charles III, who has reigned since 8 September 2022.

The Treaty of Waitangi between Queen Victoria and Māori chiefs () was signed on 6 February 1840. This laid the foundation for the proclamation of British sovereignty over New Zealand on 21 May 1840; the British monarch became New Zealand&#x27;s head of state. The country gradually became independent from Britain and the monarchy evolved to become a distinctly New Zealand institution, represented by unique symbols. The individual who is the New Zealand monarch is currently shared with 14 other countries (realms) within the Commonwealth of Nations, in each of which the monarchy is legally separate. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled &quot;King of New Zealand&quot; () and, in this capacity, he and other members of the royal family undertake various public and private functions across the Realm of New Zealand. The King is the only member of the royal family with any constitutional role.

All executive authority is vested in the King, and his assent is required for parliament to enact laws and for letters patent and orders in council to have legal effect. However, the King&#x27;s authority is subject to the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, and his direct participation in these areas of governance is limited. Most of the related powers are instead exercised by the elected members of parliament, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. Other powers vested in the King, such as dismissal of a prime minister, are significant but are treated only as reserve powers and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy.

Since the monarch resides in the United Kingdom (the oldest Commonwealth realm), most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties within the Realm of New Zealand are typically carried out by his or her representative, the governor-general of New Zealand.

The role of the monarchy is a recurring topic of public discussion. Some New Zealanders think New Zealand should become a republic with a New Zealand resident as the head of state, but most wish to retain the monarchy.

==International and domestic aspects==
The Realm of New Zealand is one of the Commonwealth realms, 15 independent members of the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same person as sovereign and head of state, and have in common the same royal line of succession. The monarch, currently King Charles III, lives in the United Kingdom; however, he and his family have toured New Zealand on occasion.

This arrangement emerged during the course of the 20th century. Since the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the pan-national Crown has had both a shared and separate character, and the sovereign&#x27;s role as monarch of New Zealand has been distinct to his or her position as monarch of the United Kingdom. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution and has become a separate establishment within New Zealand. Nonetheless, for historical reasons, the monarchy and monarch are termed &quot;British&quot; in both legal and common language; this conflicts with not only the New Zealand government&#x27;s recognition of a distinctly New Zealand Crown, but also the sovereign&#x27;s distinct New Zealand title.

On all matters pertaining to the New Zealand state, the monarch is advised solely by New Zealand ministers of the Crown, with no input from British or other realms&#x27; ministers. One of the state duties carried out on the formal advice of the New Zealand prime minister is the appointment of the governor-general. As the monarch lives outside of New Zealand, the governor-general personally represents the monarch and performs most of his or her domestic duties in their absence, in accordance with Letters Patent 1983. All royal powers in New Zealand may be carried out by both the monarch and governor-general and, in New Zealand law, the two offices are fully interchangeable, mention of one always simultaneously including the other. , the current Governor-General is Dame Cindy Kiro.

===Title===

Before 1953 the sovereign&#x27;s title was the same throughout all his or her realms and territories. It was agreed at the Commonwealth Economic Conference in London in December 1952 that each of the Commonwealth realms, including New Zealand, could adopt its own royal titles for the monarch. The New Zealand Parliament enacted the Royal Titles Act in 1953, altering the style borne by Queen Elizabeth II and giving her the title of &quot;Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;. Subsequent to the passage of the Royal Titles Act 1974, Elizabeth&#x27;s title in New Zealand became &quot;Elizabeth the Second, By the Grace of God Queen of New Zealand and of Her Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&quot; On the accession of Charles to the throne, his title was proclaimed to be &quot;King Charles the Third, By the Grace of God King of New Zealand and of His Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;, subject to confirmation in a new act.

Although the King&#x27;s New Zealand title includes the phrase &#x27;Defender of the Faith&#x27;, neither the sovereign nor the governor-general has any religious role in New Zealand; there has never been an established church in the country. This is one of the key differences from the King&#x27;s role in England, where the monarch is supreme governor of the Church of England.

===Succession and regency===
The King&#x27;s elder son, William, Prince of Wales, is the first in line to the throne. Succession is, for persons born before 28 October 2011, governed by male-preference cognatic primogeniture and, for those born after 28 October 2011, by absolute primogeniture—wherein succession passes to an individual&#x27;s children according to birth order, regardless of sex.

Laws governing the line of succession, including the Act of Settlement 1701 and Bill of Rights 1689, restrict the throne to the biological, legitimate descendants of Sophia of Hanover, and stipulate that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic and must be in communion with (i.e. a member of) the Church of England upon accession. Through the adoption of the Statute of Westminster (later repealed in New Zealand) and the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988, these constitutional laws as they apply to New Zealand now lie within the full control of the New Zealand Parliament. Nonetheless, New Zealand agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship—a reciprocal arrangement applied uniformly in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, and often likened to a treaty amongst these nations. In that spirit, the Commonwealth realms reached the Perth Agreement in 2011, committed to repeal the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which gave precedence to male heirs and excluded from succession a person married to a Roman Catholic. In New Zealand this was accomplished through the Royal Succession Act 2013.

Upon a demise of the Crown (the death or abdication of a monarch), the late sovereign&#x27;s heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any obligatory need for affirmation or further ceremony—hence arises the phrase &quot;The King is dead. Long live the King!&quot; It is customary, though, for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly proclaimed at a ceremony attended by the governor-general and senior state officials. Following an appropriate period of national mourning, the monarch is also crowned in the United Kingdom in an ancient ritual, but one not necessary for a sovereign to reign. Other than a transfer of all royal powers and functions to the new monarch from his or her predecessor, no other law or office is affected, as all references in legislation to previous monarchs, whether in the masculine (e.g. &quot;His Majesty&quot;) or feminine (e.g. &quot;the Queen&quot;), continue to mean the reigning sovereign of New Zealand. After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death, being unable to unilaterally abdicate.

Regency Acts allow for regencies in the event of a monarch who is a minor or who is physically or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. The Regency Act 1937 is a British law, not a New Zealand law, and as such has no direct applicability to New Zealand. However, the New Zealand Constitution Act 1986 specifies that should a regent be installed in the United Kingdom, that individual will carry out the functions of the sovereign of New Zealand.

===Finances===
The sovereign draws from New Zealand funds for support in the performance of their duties when in New Zealand or acting as monarch of New Zealand abroad. New Zealanders do not pay any money to the King or any other member of the royal family, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of New Zealand. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the governor-general as instruments of the King&#x27;s authority, including travel, security, residences, offices and ceremonies. Supporters of the monarchy argue it costs New Zealand taxpayers only a small outlay for royal engagements and tours and the expenses of the governor-general&#x27;s establishment. Monarchy New Zealand states &quot;[t]his figure is about one dollar per person per year&quot;, about $4.3 million per annum. An analysis by New Zealand Republic (a republican advocacy group) of the 2010 budget claimed the office of governor-general costs New Zealand taxpayers about $7.6 million in ongoing costs and $11 million for Government House upgrades, figures Monarchy New Zealand claimed had been &quot;arbitrarily inflated&quot; by New Zealand Republic.

===Cook Islands, Niue and territories===
The sovereign of New Zealand also serves as monarch to Cook Islands and Niue, territories in free association with New Zealand within the wider Realm of New Zealand. The New Zealand monarchy is unitary throughout all jurisdictions in the realm, with the headship of state being a part of all equally. As such, the sovereignty of Cook Islands and Niue is passed on not by the governor-general or parliament of New Zealand but through the overreaching Crown itself as part of executive, legislative and judicial operations in all three areas.

The self-government provisions for the Cook Islands within the Realm of New Zealand allow the King to be directly represented as head of state in Cook Islands affairs by the King&#x27;s representative, while the governor-general of New Zealand represents the monarch in matters pertaining to the entire realm. The governor-general (themselves represented by state services commissioner) represents the monarch in Niue, carrying out all the monarch&#x27;s constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on their behalf. The administrator of the territory of Tokelau is a government official appointed by New Zealand&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs to represent the New Zealand Government—not the monarch personally.

==Personification of the state==
As the living embodiment of the Crown, the sovereign is regarded as the personification, or legal personality, of the New Zealand state, with the state therefore referred to as &quot;His Majesty The King New Zealand&quot;, or &quot;The Crown&quot; (). As such, the monarch is the employer of all government staff (including judges, members of the Defence Force, police officers, and parliamentarians), as well as the owner of all state land and buildings (&quot;Crown property&quot; including &quot;Crown land&quot;), state-owned companies and agencies (&quot;Crown entities&quot;), and the copyright for all government publications (&quot;Crown copyright&quot;).
As the embodiment of the state, the monarch is the locus of oaths of allegiance, required of many employees of the Crown, as well as by new citizens, as per the oath of citizenship laid out in the Citizenship Act. This is done in to the sovereign&#x27;s Coronation oath; at the coronation of Charles III he made a &quot;solemn promise&quot; to &quot;govern the Peoples of&quot; his realms, including New Zealand, &quot;according to their respective laws and customs&quot;.

==Constitutional role==
New Zealand&#x27;s constitution is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or New Zealand in origin, and together give New Zealand a parliamentary system of government wherein the role of the King is both legal and practical. The Crown is regarded as a corporation sole, with the sovereign, in the position of head of state, as the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign&#x27;s authority.

The vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the royal prerogative, the exercise of which does not require parliamentary approval, though it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes without the authorisation of an act of Parliament. The consent of the Crown must be obtained before parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign&#x27;s prerogatives or interests, and no act of Parliament binds the King or his rights unless the act expressly provides that it does.

===Executive===

The New Zealand Government, formally termed &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;, is defined by the Constitution Act as the monarch acting on the advice of the Executive Council. One of the main duties of the Crown is to ensure that a democratic government is always in place. This involves appointing a prime minister to thereafter head the Cabinet, a committee of the Executive Council charged with advising the Crown on the exercise of the royal prerogative, and legally required to keep the governor-general up to date on state affairs.

In the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, a situation described as &quot;The [King] &quot;reigns&quot;, but the government &quot;rules&quot;, so long as it has the support of the House of Representatives.&quot; The royal prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers, and the monarch or governor-general may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations, thereby allowing the monarch to make sure that the government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the sovereign; these include applying the royal sign-manual and Seal of New Zealand to the appointment papers of governors-general, the conferral and regulation of both royal honours and heraldry, and giving his approval to any change in the sovereign&#x27;s New Zealand title.

===Foreign affairs===
The royal prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the governor-general conducts treaties, alliances and international agreements on the advice of the Cabinet. Prior to the Lomé Convention in 1975, the monarch, rather than the governor-general, would sign treaties on behalf of New Zealand. Following the signing of the convention, it was decided that the governor-general could sign such instruments. The governor-general, on behalf of the monarch, also accredits New Zealand high commissioners and ambassadors, and receives similar diplomats from foreign states. The letters of credence and recall were formerly issued by the monarch, but now are issued in the name of the incumbent governor-general (instead of following the usual international process of the letters being from one head of state to another). The issuance of passports falls under the royal prerogative, and all New Zealand passports are issued in the monarch&#x27;s name and remain his property.

===Parliament===

The sovereign is one of the two components of the New Zealand Parliament. The monarch and governor-general do not participate in the legislative process save for the granting of royal assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law; either figure or a delegate may perform this task; this is now a matter of convention. The Crown is further responsible for summoning and dissolving the parliament, after which the governor-general usually calls for a general election. The new parliamentary session is marked by either the monarch or the governor-general reading the speech from the throne; as they both are traditionally barred from the House of Representatives (the elected component of parliament), this ceremony takes place in the Legislative Council Chamber. Queen Elizabeth II personally opened parliament on seven occasions: January 1954, February 1963, March 1970, February 1974, February 1977, February 1986, and February 1990.

Despite the sovereign&#x27;s exclusion, members of parliament must still express their loyalty to him and defer to his authority, as the oath of allegiance must be recited by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seat. Further, the official opposition is traditionally referred to as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;, illustrating that, while its members are opposed to the incumbent government, they remain loyal to the sovereign (as personification of the state and its authority).

===Courts===
The sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all his subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the &quot;fount of justice&quot;. He does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the King&#x27;s name by judges and justices of the peace. The monarch is immune from criminal prosecution, the notion in common law being that the sovereign &quot;can do no wrong&quot;; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his own courts for criminal offences. The monarch, and by extension the governor-general, also grants immunity from prosecution, exercises the &quot;royal prerogative of mercy&quot;, and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.

==Cultural role==

===Royal presence and duties===

Members of the royal family have been present in New Zealand since the late 1800s, their reasons including participating in military manoeuvres or undertaking official royal tours. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of New Zealand culture will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. Official duties involve the sovereign representing the New Zealand state at home or abroad, or their relations as members of the royal family participating in government organised ceremonies either in New Zealand or elsewhere. An invitation from the Prime Minister of New Zealand is the impetus for royal participation in any New Zealand event, with informal consultation occurring beforehand. A committee of the British Cabinet Office, the Royal Visits Committee, then coordinates the visit schedule and details with the Visits and Ceremonies Office (VCO). Such events have included centennials and bicentennials; Waitangi Day; the openings of Commonwealth and other games; anniversaries of Māori treaty signings; awards ceremonies; anniversaries of the monarch&#x27;s accession; and the like. Conversely, unofficial duties are performed by royal family members on behalf of New Zealand organisations of which they may be patrons, through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the New Zealand Defence Force as colonel-in-chief, or marking certain key anniversaries.
Since 1869, when Prince Alfred, one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s sons, arrived on New Zealand&#x27;s shores, dozens of tours of New Zealand by a member of the royal family have taken place, though only five of those occurred before 1953. After Alfred came the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) in 1901; The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), in 1920; the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) in 1927; and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, from 1934 to 1935. Queen Elizabeth II was the first reigning monarch of New Zealand to tour the country, becoming such when she arrived during her 1953–1954 global tour; she broadcast from Government House in Auckland her annual royal Christmas message.

Queen Elizabeth II also toured New Zealand on a number of other occasions: between 6 and 18 February 1963, she attended celebrations at Waitangi and the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council was founded as the nation&#x27;s gift to the monarch; from 12 to 30 March 1970, the Queen, accompanied by Prince Charles and Princess Anne, participated in the James Cook bicentenary celebrations; between 30 January and 8 February 1974, and she attended and closed that year&#x27;s Commonwealth Games in Christchurch and participated in New Zealand Day events at Waitangi. As part of a Commonwealth-wide tour for her Silver Jubilee, Elizabeth was in New Zealand from 22 February to 7 March 1977; she made a brief visit, between 12 and 20 October 1981, following a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Melbourne; marked the centennial of the New Zealand Police during a tour from 22 February to 2 March 1986; the Queen closed the Commonwealth Games in Auckland and, with her son, Prince Edward, took part in events marking the of the Treaty of Waitangi between 1 and 16 February 1990; between 1 and 10 November 1995, she attended the CHOGM in Auckland and opened the newly refurbished parliament buildings; and, as part of her global tour for her Golden Jubilee, Elizabeth was in New Zealand from 22 to 27 February 2002.

Some of the royal tours undertaken by more junior members of the royal family include the 1990 visit of Princess Anne to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on Anzac Day, and when Prince William represented the Queen of New Zealand at VE and VJ Day commemorations in 2005, as part of an 11-day tour, and opened the new Supreme Court of New Zealand building in early 2010. Prince Edward spent two terms of the 1982 academic year as a house tutor and junior master at the Wanganui Collegiate School.

Apart from New Zealand, the King and his family regularly perform public duties in the other 14 Commonwealth realms of which he is head of state. This situation can mean members of the royal family will be promoting one nation and not another. On some occasions Queen Elizabeth II had represented the United Kingdom, while her governor-general represented New Zealand, with both in attendance at the same event.

===The Crown and the Defence Force===
The Crown sits at the pinnacle of the New Zealand Defence Force. The governor-general is commander-in-chief, and under the Defence Act 1990 is authorised to &quot;raise and maintain armed forces&quot;, consisting of the Royal New Zealand Navy, New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force. The sovereign&#x27;s position as head of the armed forces is reflected in New Zealand&#x27;s naval vessels bearing the prefix &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s New Zealand Ship&quot; (&quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s New Zealand Ship&quot; in the reign of a female monarch), and in the requirement that all members of the armed forces swear their allegiance to the sovereign and his or her heirs and successors. The governor-general commissions officers to command the forces.

Though the monarch and members of his family also act as colonels-in-chief of various regiments in the military, these posts are only ceremonial in nature, reflecting the Crown&#x27;s relationship with the military through participation in military ceremonies both at home and abroad. The country&#x27;s only currently ranked admiral of the fleet, field marshal and marshal of the air force is King Charles III. The ranks were also formerly held by Prince Philip, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II. Various regiments have also received a &quot;royal&quot; prefix, such as the Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers, the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, and the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment.

===The Crown and Māori===

Māori interaction with the Crown dates back to 1832, when King William IV appointed James Busby as British resident. On 28 October 1835, Busby oversaw a hui held at Waitangi, at which a flag was selected for New Zealand and a declaration of independence written by Busby was signed by 36 Māori chiefs. Both were acknowledged the following year by the King in a letter from Lord Glenelg.

As a result, the declaration&#x27;s ratification by the British Parliament in 1836, officials in the Colonial Office determined in 1839 that a treaty of cessation would need to be signed with Māori for the British Crown to acquire sovereignty over New Zealand. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs, It is considered to be a founding document of government. The Treaty identifies the Crown&#x27;s right to , or &quot;governorship&quot;, leading one Māori academic to argue that , or His Majesty&#x27;s Government in New Zealand, is party to the treaty.

Since the treaty&#x27;s implementation, a number of petitions have been made by Māori directly to the sovereign in London, who they felt they had a special relationship, the first coming from northern chiefs in 1852. This and all subsequent appeals were directed back to the sovereign&#x27;s New Zealand ministers for advice on how to proceed. The results were not always favourable to Māori, who have communicated their discontent to the monarch or other royals; in response to a refusal by the Executive Council in 1981 to allow Mana Motuhake direct access to the Queen, Māori activist Dun Mihaka offered a traditional rebuke by baring his buttocks at the Prince and Princess of Wales. In a later incident Mihaka attempted to crash into the Queen&#x27;s motorcade; he was intercepted by police before this happened.

In the Māori language, Queen Elizabeth II is sometimes referred to as , meaning &quot;the white heron of a single flight&quot;; in Māori proverb, the rare white heron is a significant bird seen only once in a lifetime. In 1953, for her coronation, Elizabeth was given a kiwi feather korowai cloak, which she wore when attending a , or Māori welcoming ceremony, also speaking partly in Māori.

===Royal symbols===
References to the monarchy are commonplace in public life in New Zealand and represent one of the most recognisable ways the head of state is incorporated into New Zealand&#x27;s national identity. Royal symbols may specifically distinguish institutions that derive their authority from the Crown (such as parliament), establishments with royal associations, or merely be ways of expressing loyal or patriotic sentiment.
The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign—Queen Elizabeth II, , is still depicted on all coins, the twenty-dollar banknote, and postage stamps such as the Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp. There are references to St Edward&#x27;s Crown, on New Zealand&#x27;s coat of arms, on various medals, and awards. These latter cases reflect the monarch&#x27;s place as the formal head of the New Zealand royal honours system. As such, only he can approve the creation of an honour, which he does on the advice of the prime minister. Though the monarch himself formally appoints members to the various orders, the governor-general administers most other responsibilities relating to New Zealand honours on the sovereign&#x27;s behalf (such as investitures).
Similar to coats of arms, flags are utilised to represent royal authority. A personal flag for use by the Queen in New Zealand was adopted in 1962. It features the shield design of the New Zealand coat of arms in the form of an oblong or square. Superimposed in the centre is a dark blue roundel bearing an initial &#x27;E&#x27; surmounted by a crown, all within a gold chaplet of roses. The current monarch, King Charles III, has not adopted a personal flag for New Zealand.

Music and song are utilised in various ways as reminders and identifiers of the sovereign. New Zealand inherited the anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;) from Britain. It remains one of the two national anthems, along with &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;, but has been generally restricted to official occasions where the monarch, a member of the royal family, or the governor-general is in attendance for a particular purpose. The right to declare a song a national anthem currently rests with the sovereign.

As in other Commonwealth realms, the King&#x27;s Birthday is a public holiday and, in New Zealand, is observed on the first Monday in June (not on the date of the monarch&#x27;s actual birth). Celebrations are mainly official, including the Birthday Honours list and military ceremonies.
===Organisations with royal patronage===

To receive patronage, an organisation must prove to be long lasting, and to be of the highest standard in their field. These organisations, such as the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association, signified by the prefix &quot;royal&quot;, have received patronage from various monarchs and their families. Royal patronage is the royal individual&#x27;s decision to make, though the Ministry for Culture and Heritage will help organisations to seek patronage.

==Debate==

Despite a similar level of political involvement by the monarchy in both New Zealand and neighbouring Australia, there is less agitation in the former for ending the monarchy and creating a republic than in the latter, where the republicanism movement is stronger. Past public opinion polls have shown that while the majority of Australians are in favour of a republic, New Zealanders on average favour retaining the monarchy. Supporters of the monarchy claim that for New Zealand, &quot;monarchy summarises the inheritance of a thousand years of constitutional government and our links with a glorious past&quot;.
Neither National nor Labour, the two major political parties currently in parliament, have a stated policy of creating a republic. The National Party&#x27;s declared principles include &quot;Loyalty to ... our Sovereign as Head of State&quot;. In 2008, former Prime Minister John Key, then Leader of the Opposition, said he is &quot;not convinced [a republic] will be a big issue in the short term,&quot; but does believe that a republic is &quot;inevitable.&quot; Former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen declared that he supported the monarchy, stating in 2004 he was &quot;a sort of token monarchist in the Cabinet these days&quot;. In 2010 he repudiated that stance, taking the view that New Zealand should move towards a republic once the Queen&#x27;s reign ends. There are two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate in New Zealand and arguing the issue in the media from time to time: Monarchy New Zealand and New Zealand Republic.

There are a number of legal issues to be addressed in order to abolish the monarchy, though individuals on both sides of the argument take a different view of the level of difficulty faced. Much of the debate focuses on the reserve powers of the sovereign; the relationship between the various regions of the Realm of New Zealand sharing the same sovereign (the absence of these matters from republican arguments having been criticised as a &quot;self-centredness of republican discussions in New Zealand&quot;); and effects on the relationship between the Crown and Māori, specifically, the continued legal status of the Treaty of Waitangi and its claims and settlements. Some academics expressed concern that governments could use republicanism to evade treaty responsibilities, while others, such as Professor Noel Cox, Chairman-Emeritus of Monarchy New Zealand, have argued a republic would not absolve the Government of its obligations under the treaty.

The institution enjoys the support of most New Zealanders, particularly those born before the Second World War. With the popular approval of Queen Elizabeth II, and the position of the Treaty of Waitangi under a republic remaining a concern to Māori and other New Zealanders alike, as well as the question of what constitutional form a republic might take unresolved, support for a republic has been no higher than one third to 40 per cent of the population. Polls indicate that many New Zealanders see the monarchy as being of little day-to-day relevance; a One News/Colmar Brunton poll in 2002 found that 58 per cent of the population believed the monarchy has little or no relevance to their lives. &quot;National Business Review&quot; poll in 2004 found 57 per cent of respondents believed New Zealand would become a republic &quot;in the future&quot;. On 21 April 2008, New Zealand Republic released a poll of New Zealanders showing 43 per cent support the monarchy should Prince Charles become king of New Zealand, and 41 per cent support a republic under the same scenario. A poll by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in January 2010, before a visit by Prince William to the country, found 33.3 per cent wanted Prince Charles to be the next monarch, with 30.2 per cent favouring Prince William. 29.4 per cent of respondents preferred a republic in the event Queen Elizabeth died or abdicated.

On 14 October 2009, a bill put forward in parliament by Keith Locke to bring about a referendum on the monarchy was drawn from the ballot of members&#x27; bills and introduced into the legislative chamber. It had been presumed that this bill would have been binding in New Zealand only, having no effect in the Cook Islands or Niue. On 21 April 2010 the bill was defeated at its first reading 68–53, and did not continue through to select committee.

On the eve of a royal tour by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, 10 November 2012, a One News/Colmar Brunton poll reported 70 per cent of people questioned responded they wanted to &quot;keep The Queen as head of state&quot;, while only 19 per cent supported a republic. Following the tour, a poll by Curia Market Research commissioned by New Zealand Republic found 51 per cent of respondents wanted Charles as King once the Queen&#x27;s reign ends, while 41 per cent supported a republic.

Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, a &quot;1News&quot;/Kantar Public Poll in September 2022 indicated that support for a republic decreased, with 50% of respondents preferring to stay with the monarchy.

Support for the monarchy in New Zealand tends to increase during times where there is considerable focus on the royal family, whether this be due to royal tours or significant events such as a royal wedding.

==History==

In the early 19th century, some Māori who visited London were introduced to British royalty. Moehanga (or Te Mahanga) of Ngāpuhi, the first Māori to visit England, claimed to have met King George III and Queen Charlotte in 1806. Other chiefs () to meet the monarch include Hongi Hika, who met King George IV in 1820.

Lieutenant James Cook first sailed to New Zealand in 1769. There he mapped the entire coastline and tentatively claimed the land for King George III of the United Kingdom. Beginning in 1790, an increasing number of European settlers came to New Zealand. In 1833, with growing lawlessness amongst traders and settlers, the British government appointed James Busby as British resident to protect British trading interests. Despite Busby&#x27;s presence, trouble increased and further action was needed. On 15 June 1839, the governor of the British colony of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps, issued a proclamation extending the boundaries of New South Wales to include such territory in New Zealand as might be acquired in sovereignty. The British government despatched Captain William Hobson to New Zealand to be lieutenant-governor under Gipps; Hobson was instructed to obtain sovereignty for the British Crown with the consent of Māori chiefs. The resultant Treaty of Waitangi was signed on 6 February 1840, at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands. This laid the foundation for the later proclamation of British sovereignty over New Zealand on 21 May 1840. Following that declaration, Britain decided to make New Zealand a separate colony, and a Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand was issued on 16 November 1840. Queen Victoria thus became New Zealand&#x27;s head of state.

In 1852, the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 was passed, establishing responsible government in New Zealand. It also provided for the governor to grant the Royal Assent in the name of the sovereign.

Queen Victoria&#x27;s second son, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, became the first British royal to visit New Zealand. He landed in Wellington on 11 April 1869, aboard his ship HMS Galatea.

In 1907, New Zealand became a dominion, which denoted that it was a country of the British Empire (and later the Commonwealth of Nations) with autonomy in domestic and foreign affairs. In 1917, letters patent of King George V set out the powers, duties and responsibilities of the governor-general and the Executive Council. The governor-general remained an appointee of the British Crown on the advice of the British Cabinet.
The concept of a fully independent New Zealand sharing the person of the sovereign with the United Kingdom and other countries only emerged gradually over time through constitutional convention. A series of Imperial Conferences held in London, from 1917 on, resulted in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which provided that the United Kingdom and the dominions were to be considered as &quot;autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown&quot;. The governor-general of New Zealand, as with all the other governors-general of the Dominions, became the direct representative of the monarch in person, rather than a diplomatic channel between the New Zealand and British governments.

The Crown was further separated amongst its dominions by the Statute of Westminster in 1931, an act of the British Parliament, which gave New Zealand and other dominions the authority to make their own laws in all matters, while requiring them all to seek each other&#x27;s assent for changes to monarchical titles and the common line of succession. The British Parliament specifically gave up any claim to legislate for a dominion, save at its own request. New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1947, after the passing of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. A convention persisted that New Zealand prime ministers consulted the British government on the appointment of governors-general until 1967.

Although the New Zealand monarchy is now independent, there remains a strong association with the British monarchy and its history. For example, there are many portraits of earlier (pre-1840) English kings and queens in New Zealand government buildings, including Government House, Wellington. Several royal portraits were gifted by Governor-General Lord Norrie.

One of the first post-Second World War examples of New Zealand&#x27;s status as an independent monarchy was the alteration of the monarch&#x27;s title in 1953. For the first time, the official New Zealand title mentioned New Zealand separately from the United Kingdom and the other realms, to highlight the sovereign&#x27;s role specifically as king/queen of New Zealand under the concept of the &#x27;divisible crown&#x27;. Elizabeth II&#x27;s title at that time was &quot;Queen of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories&quot;. Accordingly, the name of the country in official usage was also changed to the Realm of New Zealand. The Royal Titles Act 1974 further revised the monarch&#x27;s New Zealand title to remove the reference to the United Kingdom.

More recently, the Constitution Act 1986 has become the principal formal statement of New Zealand&#x27;s constitution. This law formally establishes that the sovereign (in Right of New Zealand) is the head of state of New Zealand and that the governor-general is his representative; each can, in general, exercise all the powers of the other.
==List of monarchs==
Listed here are the seven monarchs who have reigned over New Zealand—the British colony of New Zealand, from 1840; followed by the Dominion of New Zealand, beginning in 1907; and finally the present-day sovereign state of New Zealand. Originally, these monarchs reigned in their right as British sovereigns.

<doc id="720440" wikidata="Q424037" url="?curid=720440" title="Roxithromycin">
<text>Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. It is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Roxithromycin is derived from erythromycin, containing the same 14-membered lactone ring. but with an N-oxime side chain attached to the ring. 
Roxithromycin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is available under several brand names. Roxithromycin is available in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, South Korea and New Zealand, but not in the United States. It has also been shown to possess antimalarial activity.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Less common side effects include central or peripheral nervous system events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo.Rarely seen side effects are rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in the senses of smell and taste.

== Drug interactions ==

Roxithromycin has fewer interactions than erythromycin as it has a lower affinity for cytochrome P450.

Roxithromycin is not known to interact with hormonal contraceptives, prednisolone, carbamazepine, ranitidine or antacids.

When roxithromycin is administered with theophylline, some studies have shown an increase in the plasma concentration of theophylline. A change in dosage is usually not required but patients with high levels of theophylline at the start of the treatment should have their plasma levels monitored.

Roxithromycin appears to interact with warfarin. This is shown by an increase in prothrombin time and/or international normalised ratio (INR) in patients taking roxithromycin and warfarin concurrently. As a consequence, severe bleeding episodes have occurred.

== Available forms ==
Roxithromycin is commonly available as tablets or oral suspension.

== Mechanism of action ==
Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the synthesis of peptides. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
When taken before a meal, roxithromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, roxithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of roxithromycin are released.

== Metabolism ==
Only a small portion of roxithromycin is metabolised. Most of roxithromycin is secreted unchanged into the bile and some in expired air. Under 10% is excreted into the urine. Roxithromycin&#x27;s half-life is 12 hours.

== History ==
French pharmaceutical company Roussel Uclaf first marketed roxithromycin in 1987.

<text>Waterton Lakes National Park is in the southwest corner of Alberta, Canada. The national park borders Glacier National Park in Montana, United States. Waterton was the fourth Canadian national park, formed in 1895 as Kootenay Lakes Forest Reserve. It is named after Waterton Lake, in turn after the Victorian naturalist and conservationist Charles Waterton. Its range is between the Rocky Mountains and the Prairies. This park contains of rugged mountains and wilderness. It has a diverse ecosystem.

Operated by Parks Canada, Waterton is open all year, but the main tourist season is during July and August. The only commercial facilities available within the park are located at the Waterton Park townsite. This park ranges in elevation from at the townsite to at Mount Blakiston. It offers many scenic trails, including Crypt Lake trail. In 2012/2013, Waterton Lakes National Park had 402,542 visitors.

The park is the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by Peter Lynch and scored by Cadence Weapon, Laura Barrett and Mark Hamilton.

==History==
William Pearce, a Dominion Land Surveyor, was the first to suggest a park be established in the vicinity of Waterton Lakes in his 1886 annual report, although no action was taken by the government. In 1893, Frederick William Godsal, a rancher who resided north of the lakes, wrote Pearce referencing his 1886 report and suggested the area be turned into a park reserve. Pearce forwarded the proposal, noting the land had no value for agricultural and minimal grazing potential. Minister of the Interior Thomas Mayne Daly came across the proposal and directed a park reserve be created in the area. Finally, on May 30, 1895, Order-in-Council 1895-1621 established a unnamed forest park under the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot;.

While oil had been found in the area since the late 1880s, the government began approving reservation and sales of land for prospecting in 1898. In 1901, John Lineham of Okotoks organized the Rocky Mountain Drilling Company. In 1902, he drilled the first oil exploration well in Alberta on the site of oil seeps near Cameron Creek. Despite a small recovery of 34° API sweet oil, neither this well nor seven later exploration attempts resulted in production. The oil well and surrounding area was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1965. By 1905, more than half of the sections of land compromising the park had been sold or reserved for oil exploration. On September 21, 1905, Frederick William Godsal wrote the Secretary of the Interior requesting he consider expanding the park reserve for scenic and recreational purposes. The &quot;Dominion Forest Reserves Act&quot;, which came into force in 1906, established the Kootenay Lakes Forest Reserve under the authority of the Superintendent of Forestry.

In 1911, Minister of the Interior Frank Oliver introduced the &quot;Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act&quot; which designated all existing mountain parks, Elk Island and Buffalo Parks into forest reserves, with the authority to designate all or part of the reserve a &quot;Dominion Park&quot; (later National Park). On June 8, 1911, Order-in-Council P.C. 1338 designated of the area of Waterton Lakes Forest Reserve as Dominion Park, much smaller than expected by resident staff, and only a small portion of the original 1895 reserve of . In 1914, Frank Oliver&#x27;s successor as Minister of the Interior, William James Roche, significantly expanded the area of Waterton Lakes Park to .

In 1920 William Thomson, the designer and head professional of the original golf course in Banff National Park was brought to Waterton to design a nine-hole golf course. A clubhouse would be constructed in 1928 and the course was expanded to 18 holes between 1931 and 1936. Further renovations to the course in the 1950s were designed by golf course architect Stanley Thompson.

===Prince of Wales Hotel===

The Prince of Wales Hotel, one of Canada&#x27;s grand railway hotels, was constructed between 1926 and 1927 adjacent to Upper Waterton Lakes, by the Great Northern Railway of the United States in an attempt to lure American tourists during the U.S. prohibition era. The hotel, which opened in July 1927, is the only grand railway hotel in Canada to be constructed by an American railway company. The hotel was named after the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), in a transparent attempt to entice him to stay in the hotel on his 1927 Canadian tour, but the prince stayed at his own nearby ranch in Pekisko, Alberta, instead. The hotel was designated as a national historic site of Canada on 6 November 1992.

===Later history===
In 1932, Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park was formed from Waterton Lakes National Park and Glacier. It was dedicated to world peace by Sir Charles Arthur Mander on behalf of Rotary International on 18 June 1932, whose members from the Alberta and Montana chapters lobbied for the formation of the park. The Peace Park was the first of its nature in the world, and was intended to promote goodwill between nations and underscore the international nature of protection of wilderness.

In terms of local governance, those lands within Waterton Lakes National Park were split between the Municipal District of Kerr No. 39 and the Municipal District of Castle River No. 40 prior to 1944. Following a partial amalgamation of the two municipal districts, remnant unsurveyed lands within the park were incorporated as Improvement District (ID) No. 11 on January 1, 1944. It was renumbered to ID No. 8 on April 1, 1945, and again to ID No. 4 on January 1, 1969.

The Waterton-Glacier International was inscribed a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. In 1979, Waterton became Canada&#x27;s second biosphere reserve and the first Canadian national park to take part in this UNESCO program. Biosphere Reserves are created to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between humans and the natural environment.

In September 2017, a large forest fire forced the evacuation of the townsite and park. The fire burned through 200 km2 of the park, destroying the visitor centre, stables and other buildings. Some 80% of hiking trails were affected and several remained closed for the 2018 season. The wildfire consumed one third of the park and stopped mere metres from the Prince of Wales Hotel.

==Geology==
The oldest rocks in the park are marine sediments dating back 1.5 billion years. These rocks are composed of limestone, dolomite and igneous rocks. There are fossilized sea beds as well as salt pseudomorph. There are numerous stromatolite formations that are 1.3 billion years old.

Unlike the Canadian Rockies, whose sedimentary strata are more or less inclined, the Waterton sediments are characterized by a single overlap. The Lewis Overthrust allowed sediment Proterozoic to move as a unit, more or less, horizontally on the rocks of the Cretaceous period dating from about 70 million years ago on a remote 100 km south-east of the mountain&#x27;s present location. The fact that older rocks end up on younger rocks is a rare occurrence in geology. Under the Proterozoic layer, there is a layer dating from the Upper Cretaceous which is mainly composed of schist.

Although there are no glaciers left in Waterton, aside from a few expanses of eternal snow, the landscape has been greatly shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation. The park has many glacial troughs, the hanging valleys, the ridge, the cirque, the kame and esker. Since the end of the last ice age, the Cameron and Blakiston rivers have formed two alluvial fans at their mouths.

== Ecology ==
Waterton Lakes National Park spans four ecoregions, foothills parkland, montane, subalpine and alpine. Waterton is the only National Park in Canada with the foothills parkland ecoregion, which comprises approximately 10 percent of the Park and occupies a narrow band along the eastern edge of the foothills of Alberta from Calgary to Waterton and into parts of the United States.

=== Flora ===
There are over 1000 species of vascular plants found in the park. Over 20 species are endemic to the park such as Lewis&#x27; mock-orange and white-veined wintergreen. Over 50 species of plants that are found the park are rare in Canada such as Bolander&#x27;s quillwort, Lyall&#x27;s scorpionweed, and Brewer&#x27;s monkeyflower. Waterton Lakes National Park is also home to small ferns called moonworts and the Waterton moonwort is endemic to the park.

=== Fauna ===
Animals that inhabit this national park include wolverines, bighorn sheep, bald eagles, white-tailed deer, mule deer, mountain goats, elk, moose, foxes, timber wolves, bison, coyotes, beavers, river otters, cougars, lynxes, bobcats, snowshoe hares, pikas, hoary marmots, grizzly bears and black bears. Many bird species nest or migrate through the park, some of which include bald eagles, Canada geese, orange-crowned warblers, and MacGillivray&#x27;s warblers.

==Climate==
Waterton Lakes National Park Cameron Falls weather station has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb), bordering relatively closely on a subarctic climate (Dfc). Summertime is mild with cool nights, while winter is chilly with highs around freezing. Snowfall is heavy, averaging 481.5 cm (189.6 inches).

==Biosphere Reserve==

In 1979, Waterton and bordering Glacier National park in the US were designated as World Biosphere reserves, preserving mountains, prairie, lakes and freshwater wetlands ecosystems. Habitats represented in the parks&#x27; range include: prairie grasslands, aspen grove forests, alpine tundra/high meadows, lower subalpine forests, deciduous and coniferous forests.

==World Heritage Site==

The park is part of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, designated as World Heritage Site in 1995 for their distinctive climate, physiographic setting, mountain-prairie interface, and tri-ocean hydrographical divide. They are areas of significant scenic values with abundant and diverse flora and fauna.

<text>A deadbolt or deadlock is a type of lock morticed into a wooden door where a bolt is thrown into the door frame, using a key from either side, to secure the door. It is distinct from a spring bolt lock because a deadbolt can only be opened by a key or handle. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key, as well as make the door more resistant to forced entry. A deadbolt is often used to complement a spring-bolt lock on an entry door to a building.

== Common types ==
A deadlock, if it is cylinder operated, may be either single cylinder or double cylinder. A single cylinder deadlock will accept a key on one side of the lock, but is operated by a twist knob on the other side. Double cylinder locks will accept a key on both sides and therefore do not require (and often do not have) any twist knob. This prevents unwanted unlocking of the door by forced access to the interior twist knob (via a nearby window, for example). Double cylinder locks are sometimes banned from areas because they can be difficult to open from the inside and violate fire safety regulations. Some lock manufacturers also have a &quot;lockable&quot; knob: a key is always needed on one side (usually external), and a twist knob can be used on the other (internal), &quot;unless&quot; a button has been pressed, in which case a key is also needed on the internal side.

A variant of the standard deadbolt is the vertical deadbolt, invented by Samuel Segal. Vertical deadbolts resist &quot;jimmying&quot;, in which an intruder inserts a crowbar between the door and the jamb and attempts to prise the bolt out of the door.

Other types of deadbolts include:
* Classroom-function (thumb-turn only unlocks door)
* Exit-only function (no external cylinder)
* Push-button deadbolt (mechanical or electrical)
* Single cylinder with removable thumb-turn

==Safety==
The double cylinder design raises a safety issue. In the event of a fire, occupants will be prevented from escaping through double-cylinder locked doors unless the correct key is used. This is an avoidable cause of death in house fires. The risk can be mitigated by locking the deadlock only when there are no occupants inside the building, or leaving the key near the keyhole. Some fire departments suggest putting the key on a small nail or screw near the door at floor level, since the cleanest air is at floor level and one may be crawling to get to the exit, thus placing the key where it is easiest to find. 

Note that single cylinder dead locks (with an unlocked twist mechanism on the inside of the door) do not have this problem, and therefore are most commonly used on fire exits. Some areas have fire safety codes that do not allow a locked exit.

<doc id="720453" wikidata="Q905501" url="?curid=720453" title="Early Irish law">
<text>Early Irish law, also called Brehon law (from the old Irish word meaning judge), comprised the statutes which governed everyday life in Early Medieval Ireland. They were partially eclipsed by the Norman invasion of 1169, but underwent a resurgence from the 13th until the 17th century, over the majority of the island, and survived into Early Modern Ireland in parallel with English law. Early Irish law was often mixed with Christian influence and juristic innovation. These secular laws existed in parallel, and occasionally in conflict, with canon law throughout the early Christian period.

The laws were a civil rather than a criminal code, concerned with the payment of compensation for harm done and the regulation of property, inheritance and contracts; the concept of state-administered punishment for crime was foreign to Ireland&#x27;s early jurists. They show Ireland in the early medieval period to have been a hierarchical society, taking great care to define social status, and the rights and duties that went with it, according to property, and the relationships between lords and their clients and serfs.

The secular legal texts of Ireland were edited by D. A. Binchy in his six-volume &quot;Corpus Iuris Hibernici&quot;. The oldest surviving law tracts were first written down in the seventh century and compiled in the eighth century.

==Origins==
Early Irish law consisted of the accumulated decisions of the Brehons, or judges, guided entirely by an oral tradition. Some of these laws were recorded in writing by Christian clerics. The earliest theory to be recorded is contained in the Prologue to the . According to that text, after a difficult case involving St. Patrick, the Saint supervised the mixing of native Irish law and the law of the church. A representative of every group came and recited the laws related to that group, and they were written down and collected into the , excepting that any law that conflicted with church law was replaced. The story also tells how the law transitioned from the keeping of the poets, whose speech was &quot;dark&quot; and incomprehensible, to the keeping of each group who had an interest in it. The story is extremely dubious as not only is it written many centuries after the events it depicts, but it also incorrectly dates the collection of the to the time of St. Patrick while scholars have been able to determine that it was collected during the 8th century, at least three centuries after the time of St. Patrick. Some of the ideas in the tale may be correct, and it has been suggested by modern historians that the Irish jurists were an offshoot from the poetic class that had preserved the laws. According to the Annals of Ulster, the was written in AD 438.

For some time, especially through the work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting as a method of shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, such as the use of sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what has changed. A past may still be suggested for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms&#x27; being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.

Today, the legal system is assumed to contain some earlier law influenced by the church, and adaptation through methods of reasoning the Irish jurists would have sanctioned. There is a dispute as to just how large a role each of these aspects may have played in creating the legal texts. The evidence leaves important scope for debate.

In one area, scholars have found material that is clearly old. A number of legal terms have been shown to have originated in the period before the Celtic languages split up, because they are preserved both in Old Irish and in the Welsh legal texts. On the other hand, this is not regarded as unquestionable evidence that the practices described by such terms are unchanged or even have their origins in the same period as do the terms.

Another important aspect when considering the origins is that the early Irish law texts are not always consistent. Early Irish law is, like the Old Irish language, remarkably standard across an Island with no central authority; as one scholar wrote, &quot;The edifice of the law stands above all local and regional rivalries as a unified system.&quot; Even so, close examination has revealed some variations. Among these one can especially point to variations both in style and content between two of the major legal schools, as they are known: those that produced the and .

==Substantive law==

===Women and marriage===
 Indications of women&#x27;s status is indicated by the honour price system. A typical woman did not carry an honour price: a position shared with children, the insane, slaves, and others. However, there were many exceptions: for example, status was gained through inheritance. At times, some rose to ranks of leadership, and women, like men, were Brehons. Brehon Laws have a reputation among modern scholars as rather progressive in their treatment of women, with some describing the law as providing for equality between the sexes. The Laws generally reflect a patriarchal and patrilineal society in which the rules of inheritance were based on agnatic descent. It has sometimes been assumed that the patriarchal elements of the law are the result of influence by canon law or continental practice displacing an older, more egalitarian ancient Celtic tradition, but this is based mainly on conjecture and there is little hard evidence to support such claims.

, a Christian Law, promulgated by the Synod of Birr in 697, sought to raise the status of women of that era, although the actual effect is unknown. Regardless, although Irish society under the Brehon Laws was male-dominated, women had greater freedom, independence and rights to property than in other European societies of the time. Men and women held their property separately. The marriage laws were very complex. For example, there were scores of ways of combining households and properties and then dividing the property and its increase when disputes arose.

Divorce was provided for on a number of grounds (that ultimately deal with the inability to have a child), after which property was divided according to what contribution each spouse had made to the household. A husband was legally permitted to hit his wife to &quot;correct&quot; her, but if the blow left a mark she was entitled to the equivalent of her bride-price in compensation and could, if she wished, divorce him. The property of a household could not be disposed of without the consent of both spouses.

Polygamy was also supported, and regulated with complex codes. Later it was justified by reference to the Old Testament although church authorities opposed it.

Under Western Catholic church law, women were still largely subject to their fathers or husbands and were not normally permitted to act as witnesses, their testimony being considered &quot;biased and dishonest&quot;.

===Kingship===
While scholars have discovered a fair amount of information about how Irish Kingship worked, relatively little is actually related to early Irish laws. In particular, very little material survives regarding succession practices, which have been reconstructed as the system of Tanistry. A section of the tract on status was apparently devoted to succession, although little survives. Most early material on succession was collected by Domhnal O&#x27;Davoren in the 16th century. Another seemingly important omission is that the laws never mention the High King of Ireland centred at Tara. Likewise, the laws only once mention the practice of individuals being ineligible for kingship if they are blemished (a practice more widely evident elsewhere, especially in Irish mythology). That mention is only incidental to a regulation on the compensation for bee stings when the legal tract relates the story of Congal Cáech, who was deposed on account of being blinded by a bee.

A fair amount of the material on kings relates to their position within the Irish laws of status, which see, of which the king is ranked at the top, parallel with the Bishops and the highest level of poets. Three levels of kings are referred to in the status tracts, such as : , (the king of peaks) who is identified elsewhere as the (king of a [single] ), who is below the (the king of bands) who is identified with the (king of [multiple] ) or (overking), who in turn is below the (the ultimate king of every individual) who is known also as the (king of overkings) and (king of a province).

To a certain degree, kings acted as agents of the law. While other kings in Europe were able to promulgate law, such as Alfred the Great and his Doom book, Irish kings had very little authority to do so. They could collaborate on law authored by the church. has the names of many kings attached to it who apparently enacted and enforced the law. Additionally, a king could issue a temporary law in times of emergency. But kings could not, by their own authority, issue permanent law codes. Kings also acted as judges, although the extent of their power compared to that of professional jurists has been debated. One law tract, {Gubretha Caratniad, describes a giving advice to a king (in this case, advice that seems flawed but is actually correct) who then gives it as a judgment in a case. It is not clear how much kings made judgments by themselves and how much they had to follow professional advice. The kings do not appear to have stood as judges in all cases, and in some cases, the professional jurists took that role.

One subject the laws &quot;did&quot; cover is how the king fit within the rest of the legal system. The king was not supposed to be above the law. Some stipulations applied specifically to the king. With a king being the most powerful individual, and the one with the highest honour in an area, it was difficult to enforce the law against him. Although it might have been possible to proceed against the king as against any other, the laws also had an innovative solution to this quandary. Instead of enforcing against the king directly, a dependent of the king known as an (substitute churl) was enforced against instead, and the king was responsible for repaying the substitute churl. The laws also specified certain cases in which a king lost his honor price. These included doing the work of a commoner, moving around without a retinue, and showing cowardice in battle; again, though, it is unclear how often such stipulations were followed.

Finally, the laws commented on how the king was to arrange his life and holdings and how many individuals should be in his retinue. In particular, gives a highly schematized and unrealistic account of how the king spends his week: Sunday is for drinking ale, Monday is for judging, Tuesday is for playing , Wednesday is for watching hounds hunt, Thursday is for sexual union, Friday is for racing horses, and Saturday is for judging (a different word from Monday, but the distinction is unclear).

===Status===
According to the introduction to the , the world had numerous problems before the creation of that text. Among those problems was that everyone was in a state of equality. Unequal status was of great import to early Irish Christian society and it is recorded in many places in the early Irish laws.

The Irish law texts describe a highly segmented world, in which each person had a set status that determined what legal tasks they could undertake and what recompense they could receive when a crime was committed against them. and are two of the main texts focusing on lay landholders, the latter of which also briefly covers the status of skilled individuals and of clerics. Other texts describe other groups, such as , which focuses on the status of poets.

Much depended on status, and each rank was assigned an honour that was quantified in an honour-price to be paid to them if their honour was violated by certain crimes. The types of food one received as a guest in another&#x27;s house, or while being cared for due to injury varied based on status. Lower honour prices limited the ability to act as sureties and as witnesses. Those of higher status could &quot;over-swear&quot; the oaths of those of lower status.

====Ecclesiastical grades====
In part, the seven ecclesiastical grades originate outside Ireland (as holy orders, later subdivided into minor orders and major orders) although their position in Ireland has been shaped by local thinking. The grades are given in as (lector), (doorkeeper), (exorcist), (sub-deacon), (deacon), (priest), and (bishop) although &quot;Bretha Déin Chécht&quot; puts the lector in a third position. The seven grades are subsumed into the Irish law of status, but it is unclear to what degree they conformed to all of the various status stipulations. According to , the seven grades of the church are the basis for the theoretical seven lay and poetic grades (see below). At the same time it is clear that the number seven is an insular invention, in the Eastern Church there were normally five or six grades (sometimes more), and the Western Church typically had eight or nine grades.

Although the various groups were theoretically on par with each other, the church apparently had supremacy. states &quot;Who is nobler, the king or the bishop? The bishop is nobler, for the king rises up before him on account of the Faith; moreover, the bishop raises his knee before the king.&quot; This relative ranking is reflected elsewhere. In addition, according to the ranking of the lay grades was modeled after the ecclesiastical grades in that there should be seven grades, a number rarely met perfectly.

====Lay grades====
Irish law recognised a number of classes, from unfree to king, which were ranked within the status tracts. Little space was given to the unfree, which reflects the lack of dependence upon slaves as opposed to other societies, such as Ancient Rome. The laws discuss slaves, both male and female, and the term for a female slave, , became a broader currency term. Anthropologist David Graeber suggests this indicates a significant trade in female slaves was present not long before the laws were written. As unfree, slaves could not be legal agents either for themselves or others. In addition to the wholly unfree, a few individuals were semi-free. The (hereditary serf) was bound to work the land of his master, whereas the had no independent status or land of his own, but could at least leave as he might desire.

Others might be of less than full status, based on age or origin. The status of children was based on their parents, and they could not act independently. The rights of sons increased with age, but they did not fully increase until after the death of the father. A young son just out on his own was called a (a man of middle huts), apparently, someone who occupied a hut on his father&#x27;s land. These persons were semi-independent but did not have the full honour price of a free man until they reached 20. Even after a certain age, a &quot;Son of a Living Father&quot; was expected to be dutiful to his father and could only set up an independent household with his father&#x27;s permission. In addition, those from outside a normally had a low status, as status was based not only on property but also on familial connections.

There are two main ranks of commoners, the (lit. &quot;young lord&quot;) and (&quot;cow lord&quot;), though Binchy thinks the is a recent offshoot of the latter, who had less property but was still a freeman. In addition are the (a of quality who had an honour-price of 5 ). The highest commoner was the (&quot;land man&quot;). Either of the last, according to Binchy, may be the &quot;normal &quot; who appears within the law texts. The three ranks of commoners, at least according to the status tract, vary in the type of clientship they undertook and the property they could hold, though it is unclear how this worked in practice. Commoners apparently had to co-operate in farming as they did not have enough property to own a whole plough-share or all the rights in a mill.

Above these are a series of lords who apparently had clients of their own—the primary factor in lordship—as well as more property and a higher honour price. According to , each grade of lord increase by 5 for each rank, and also increased the number of clients. In addition, when they travelled they were expected to maintain a retinue with them. A lord not only had greater ability but also needed to take greater steps to preserve their honour, lest they lose their lordship. The order of lords varies, but in it is as follows: (&quot;lord of vassals&quot;), (&quot;high lord&quot;), (&quot;lord of precedence&quot;), and the (&quot;lord of superior testimony&quot;).

After the normal lords were the , who was supposed to be heir to the throne. He had higher property qualifications than the , but his prime claim to higher status was that he would one day be king. Kings held the highest status that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven , and higher kings had yet a higher status. Having the highest status, the king especially was expected to be careful to keep his honour. Cowardice, as demonstrated in flight from battle, as well as taking up manual labour might cost him his honour-price.

These grades are generally equated with the seven grades of clerics, although there is some discrepancy as to how the grades line up, with various texts doing it in different ways and selecting only certain lay grades and ignoring others.

The ranking of lay grades has been seen by many scholars as rather schematic and not reflecting realities on the ground. Some of the texts give considerable detail on diet, tools owned, the number of livestock, and even the size of the house a person of a given status had. Modern scholars have generally assumed such details rarely match exactly what someone of a given rank had. In addition, contains the fee a client paid to a lord, according to rank from the lowest free man through the noble ranks, even though no noble would be another&#x27;s client.

====Poetic grades====
Paralleling the status of the lay grades are the grades of the (poets). Each poetic rank corresponds to a particular lay (and ecclesiastical) rank, from to king. In these are given as , , , , , , and . These are given the same status as and the same honour prices as the lay grades, and hence have effectively the same rights. The qualifications for each grade is where the difference occurs. The qualifications fit into three categories, the status of the poet&#x27;s parent or grandparent, their skill and their training. A particular number of compositions are given for each rank, with the having 350.

In addition to the seven main ranks, variously named ranks below these seem to be names for unskilled poets, the , , and Their honour prices are no more than a pittance, and their poetry is apparently painful to hear.

====Other grades====
Other professions could give status based on the profession and the skill, but no professions besides poets could have a status as high as the bishop, king, or highest poet. For instance, in one text the jurist or had three ranks, and the highest was given an honour price only halfway up the other scales. The ranking of a was based on his skill and whether he knew all three components of law (here: traditional law, poetry, and canon law), or fewer. A craftsman who worked with wood could have similar honour prices but these were based on his craftsmanship. A physician and a blacksmith, among other ranks, had an even lower honour price—less than half what the could achieve, and the honour price apparently did not vary based on skill. Other professionals, such as makers of chariots or engravers, had still lower honour prices (less than that of a ). Finally, a few professions received only meagre ranks, as with the lowest poets, and the authors may be actively making fun of some of the professions, such as comb makers.

====Change in status====
Status in early Ireland was not entirely rigid and it was possible for a family to raise its status. If three consecutive generations—grandfather, father, and son—had the property qualifications of a lord, or the poetic qualifications of a higher level poet, etc., then the member of the third generation became a lord. On the other hand, the son or grandson of a lord, or a poet, etc., who did not have the proper qualifications, did not have that status. The grandson of a person with a certain status could have that status themselves, assuming they had the proper qualifications, even if their father did not.

This created an interesting in-between stage. A commoner who had the property qualifications but not the parentage to become a lord is variously referred to as a , (a commoner lord), a (a man of withdrawal), or an (an [here with a broader meaning than lord] between two [types of] ). According to , these individuals had status in between a commoner and a full lord. In the case of poets, a poet with skill qualifications but who did not have proper training was a bard. According to Breatnach poets who were not allied with the church were given this rank for that reason.

In addition, there were ways that, in an extraordinary circumstance, an individual could achieve higher status without having parents with such qualifications. Someone who chose to become a (hospitaller) could have twice the normal property qualifications of a lord of whatever grade (and this can extend, in theory, up to the qualifications of a king). Further, a had to open his house to any guests. This included feeding them, no matter how large the group—he could lose his status if he ever refused a guest. Because of that stipulation, the position of was potentially ruinous, and this outcome is portrayed in a number of tales such as in and . A commoner might also ascend to the status of a lord if he is a (lord of violence). Such a person helped individuals to avenge deaths committed in another for a limited time after the cessation of hostilities, although the details are unclear. A poet who had the skill and training of a rank, but not the proper familial qualifications received half the honour price that his skill and training otherwise earned.

===Clientship===
A member of the property-owning classes could advance himself by becoming a &quot;free client&quot; of a more powerful lord, somewhat akin to the Roman system of clientship. The lord made his client a grant of property (sometimes land, but more usually livestock) for a fixed period of time. The client owed service to his lord, and at the end of the grant period returned the grant with interest. Any increase beyond the agreed interest was his to keep. This allowed for a certain degree of social mobility as an astute free client could increase his wealth until he could afford clients of his own, thus becoming a lord.

A poorer man could become a &quot;base client&quot; by selling a share in his honour price, making his lord entitled to part of any compensation due him. The lord could make him a smaller grant of land or livestock, for which the client paid rent in produce and manual labour. A man could be a base client to several lords simultaneously.

===Physical injury===
On account of the structure of early Irish society, all law was essentially civil and offenders had to answer only to the victim or the victim&#x27;s representative. This is important to point out, as in case of serious injury it is in stark contrast to most modern legal systems.

====Payment for wounding====
Although early Irish law recognised a distinction between intentional and unintentional injury, any type of injury was still normally unlawful and requiring compensation. The main exception is injuries received when the victim has gone into a place where an injury is likely. In all other cases, an injurer was responsible for paying a fine. The legal text &quot;Bretha Déin Chécht&quot; &quot;The Judgments of Dían Cécht&quot; goes into considerable detail in describing the fines based on the location of the wound, the severity, and in some cases the type.

According to that text, the payment was decided by a physician after nine days. Prior to that, the victim was cared for by his family and a physician. Some suggest that the effects of the wound would be clear to a physician at that point if not before. First, either the victim would have died if such was likely, or it would be clear that the patient was in danger. If the first was the case, the injurer had to face punishment for murder, and in the second he had to pay a heavy fine called a , &quot;blood-lying of death.&quot; If the victim had recovered but his wound was still present, it was measured and a fine paid. describes that the wound was measured according to how many grains of a certain plant fit in the wound. The higher the status one was, the smaller the grain used. Thus, there are nine grains mentioned in the text, from a grain of wheat to a bean. If the wound did not heal, and thus the physical blemish was a problem for the victim&#x27;s honour, further payments were required.

Early Irish law saw certain locations, known as the &quot;twelve doors of the soul&quot; were considered particularly severe. It has been suggested that this is because of the potential for such wounds to turn deadly, although the law texts do not suggest any reason. In such cases, the physician was entitled to a greater share of the fine—one half. Similarly, if the wound is one of &quot;the seven principal bone-breakings,&quot; or if it causes constant vomiting or bloody urine the physician also received a greater fee.

====Sick maintenance====
If it seemed that the patient would recover but still needed nursing, the injurer was responsible for that. This was known as sick maintenance, rendering variously , , , or in different texts. &quot;Bretha Crólige&quot; goes into great detail about this process, describing how the injurer had to find a suitable location and move the victim. Then the injurer had to pay for food for the victim and a retinue—which could be considerable depending on the victim&#x27;s rank. The injurer also had to provide someone to fulfil the victim&#x27;s duties while he was incapacitated. He also had to pay a fine for the missed opportunity for procreation if appropriate.

&quot;Bretha Crólige&quot; also goes into the importance of keeping a proper environment for the victim during his sick-maintenances. Largely this means that anything that might cause loud noise was prohibited in the vicinity. This included fights by men as well as by dogs, the playing of games and even the disciplining of children.

It is clear from the law tracts that the practice of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead, an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. &quot;Bretha Crólige&quot; does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. It does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus it was very hard to provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.
====Murder and avoidance of capital punishment====
Early Ireland has the distinction of being one of the first areas to shun capital punishment. While a murderer might be killed for his/her crime, this was the option of last resort. Instead, the murderer typically had to pay two fines. One is the fixed or , that is either a &quot;body fine&quot; or a &quot;wergild&quot;, and the other is the , an honour price owed to the kin of the victim that varied according to the status of the kinsman to whom it was owed and the closeness of his relationship to the victim. Should the murderer be unable to pay by himself, his family was normally responsible for paying any amount the murderer could not pay. Should the family be either unable or unwilling to pay, the victim&#x27;s family took custody of the murderer. At this point, the victim&#x27;s family had three options. They could await payment, sell the murderer into slavery, or kill the murderer. Even then, the monetary possibilities may have discouraged capital punishment in some cases. In certain cases, though, where the murderer and victim were relatives, capital punishment could not be carried out as it would make the executioner commit or &quot;kin-slaying&quot;.

Another situation where the murderer could be killed was when the murderer was at large and the fines had not been paid. The victim&#x27;s family apparently was responsible to launch a blood feud. It is unclear how often capital punishment was carried out in situations where it would be licit without any records other than the legal tracts. It is clear that that punishment could be avoided in most cases.

The origin of this particular legal provision is as unclear as the rest of Irish law. The so-called &quot;Pseudo-Historical Prologue to the Senchas Már&quot;, a late introduction to the main collection of Irish law, makes a claim on how this came about. It declares that prior to the coming of St. Patrick, Irish law demanded capital punishment in all cases of murder. Christianity was supposed to preach forgiveness. The two fines are apparently a compromise so that the murderer is both punished and forgiven. It is at least dubious whether or not this is a valid historical account, given the lateness of the story (originating hundreds of years after Patrick&#x27;s time).

===Kinship===
Early Irish law recognised a number of degrees of agnatic kinship, based on a belief that there was a common male ancestor. The closest kin group that is defined is (bright-kin)—descendants of a common grandfather (including the grandfather&#x27;s relationships to his descendants and his children). This is followed by the (certain-kin)—descendants of a common great-grandfather, (after-kin)—descendants of a common great-great-grandfather, and the (end-kin), all of which contain the old Irish word for kin or family, . The is, by far, the kin-group most commonly mentioned.

The leader of the kin group was known either as (pillar of the family) or (head [literally] of the family). He apparently was a senior member selected from the kin group based on various qualifications. One of his main duties was to take responsibility for members of the kin-group, acting as a surety for some of the actions of members, making sure debts are paid (including for murder). If the member could not be made to pay, the fee was normally paid by members of the kin group. He was also responsible for unmarried women after the death of their fathers.

As mentioned above, the actions of a member could require other kin to pay a fine. In certain cases, the kin-group could refuse liabilities, although in some cases only after they been proclaimed as a non-member, which might occur if the member did not carry out his responsibilities to the kin. One particularly heinous crime in early Irish law was (kin-slaying) because it was against a group that had some right to trust. The killer had to give up their kin-land but was still liable for fines incurred by other members of the kin. An undutiful son might also be excluded from certain kin rights as well, especially as sons of a living father generally did not have significant rights of legal actions except as permitted by the father.

====Inheritance====

Early Ireland practised partitive inheritance whereby each of the sons received equal portions, and any grandsons whose father predeceased their grandfather equally split their father&#x27;s portion. When the Normans entered Ireland and saw the Irish practice they called it gavelkind, the Jute inheritance in Kent to which it seemed similar. Early Irish law typically did not distinguish between &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot; children, so any recognised, even those of concubines, received a portion. On the other hand, disobedient sons were automatically excluded. In addition, adopted children could receive a portion of kin land, though status as an inheritor and the inheritance amount had to be explicitly stipulated.

The division of land is somewhat obscure. One maxim suggests that the youngest son divided the land into equal parts. The eldest chose first, followed by the second and so on until the youngest received the remaining land. The intent was to make the division of land equal. Other laws suggested that the eldest son had automatic claims to the buildings. There are some hints that this only happened if a younger son challenged a division. The normal practice was that the eldest son both divided and chose first, but had to divide equally. More rarely, a father might divide the land for his sons in his lifetime.

While a daughter with brothers did not normally receive a portion of the inheritance in land, she could inherit movable property. In a case where there are no sons, some of the law tracts allow the daughter to inherit a limited portion. Unless her husband was a foreigner to the and had no land of his own, the land did not descend to her sons but instead went to the other members of her agnatic kin group. There was apparently pressure for a woman with land to marry a relative to keep the land within the kin group.

Finally, if a man died with no children, the property was distributed between his nearest kin—first the descendants of his father, and if there were no such descendants, then between the descendants of his grandfather, and so on. Any extra land that daughters could not inherit because of female inheritance limits also went to the wider kin. The head of a kin group was entitled to extra property since he was liable for debts a kinsman could not pay.

====Land rights of kin====
The potential for inheritance by even distant kin meant that, in Early Irish law, those kin all had some sort of right in the land. Land that had been inherited was known as (kin-land). Certain rights of use of land by the owner&#x27;s kin seem to have existed. Moreover, it was possible that land could be redistributed if a certain branch of the family had few descendants and hence larger shares in the land per person. In such a case, even some more distant cousins could acquire the land, though they benefited less than closer kin. Apparently because of these potential claims it could apparently be difficult to alienate kin-land. Even when selling land that an individual had acquired separately from an inheritance, a portion went to his kin.

==Legal theory==
===Changes in the legal system===
Ireland had no regular central authority capable of making new law and hence the Brehon laws were entirely in the hands of the jurists. As such, some early scholars felt that the legal system was essentially unchanging and archaic. More recently scholars have noticed that some methods of change were laid out within the Brehon laws. In particular, &quot;Cóic Conara Fugill&quot; mentions five bases on which a judge must base judgment, and at least three offer some room for change: (legal maxim), (legal analogy), and (natural law) (the other two are , a type of legal verse jurists were trained to create to mark a statement made by someone who knows the law and (scriptural testimony)). It has not yet been studied in detail how exactly these three innovative methods were used.

===Maxims===
The use and application of maxims is clearly a location where the principles of Irish law could be recorded. Any number of maxims may be found within the Early Irish Laws and perhaps the reason why we are unable to derive a coherent theory of law from them is that there are a great many different topics. Some do seem to represent a legal theory, such as the maxim in that &quot;no-one is obliged to give something to another for nothing&quot; and that in &quot;Bretha Crólige&quot; that &quot;the misdeed of the guilty should not affect the innocent&quot;. These maxims do say more than one might think since legal systems often have problems balancing the interests of all. The majority of maxims treat with more specific problems. The main problem with our understanding of maxims is that while one law text tells us that they were used as a basis of judgment we know little else about them; we do not even know how exactly maxims could be used for judgment. A further complication is that we know very little about the origin of maxims (or even what the jurists thought was the origin) and similarly we do not know whether jurists were introducing new maxims regularly or whether all maxims were &quot;supposed&quot; to be from time immemorial.

===Natural law===
Early Irish law mentions in a number of places or natural law. This is a concept apparently borrowed from, or at least akin with, European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: (truth) and (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. The laws tell stories of how truth could apparently cure a person and falsehood could cause blisters. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have passed the test of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time.

==Legal procedure==
The early Irish laws are devoid of a state-centred enforcement mechanism and at least some of the judges were outside the state apparatus. This did not mean that the laws were ineffective, rather the methods of enforcement of legal procedures worked in such a way to fit with the conditions of society.

===Suretyship===
Sureties were the prime enforcers in early Irish law. They were not government officials, but rather sureties who were appointed to enforce a contract or other legal relationship. , the law tract that deals most with sureties, offers formulaic speeches the contractors may have recited ceremonially to appoint sureties and make the sureties swear to perform their duties properly. In addition to sureties appointed for specific contracts, relatives might be expected to act as sureties in cases where they were not specifically bound. There is also evidence that most sureties were either relatives or lords of the contractor.

Three types of sureties appear in Irish law. The (and in earlier texts ) refers to a surety who is expected to enforce payment from the contractor. Apparently, in standard contracts two (plural of ) were appointed by each party. The word might also refer to the &quot;binding&quot; of a contract. If the contractor whom he is appointed for defaults it is the s responsibility to attempt to make the contractor pay. If he does not act or does not put in sufficient effort he loses his honour price. In attempting to extract payment, the had a wide range of powers. He might distrain the contractor&#x27;s property, imprison or even violently attack the contractor. Apparently, as with witnessing, someone could not be a to a contract worth more than his honour-price.

The is generally referred to as a &quot;paying surety&quot;. Should the contractor default, the had to pay the debt from his own property. He could then attempt to extract the money from the contract. Assumedly, the only paid if the was unable to make the debtor pay. Since acting as a could mean a financial loss that might not be repaid, the law tracts apparently see the position as dangerous, as one of three &quot;dark things of the world.&quot; The , like other sureties, were paid a fee when hired, which potentially made up for the risk they undertook. A person could not act as a in contracts worth more than his honour-price, though it was possible that one might act as a ráth for only part of a contract, in which case they were responsible for payment only up to their honour-price.

Finally, the is a surety who became a hostage in the case of a default. Once the hostage was in captivity, the debtor had ten days to pay the debt to have the hostage released. If the hostage was not released by then, expenses to the debtor could become exorbitant. The had to pay his own ransom by paying his body price, which was expensive, and the debtor had to pay twice that fee plus the surety&#x27;s honour price. The could enforce the debt to him by himself.
==Relationship to the church and church law==
Brehon law was produced in the vernacular language by a group of professional jurists. The exact relationship of those jurists to the church is subject to considerable debate. Brehon law at times was at odds with and at times influenced by Irish canon law.

===Vernacular church law===
A number of law tracts that originated from the church were written in Old Irish. The most famous of these is , which was apparently created in 697 under the influence of Adomnán and ratified by a number of ecclesiastics and kings whose names appear in the text. The idea of the law was apparently to supplement the punishments of Brehon law for crimes against women, children, and clerics. In some ways it follows the ideas embodied in Brehon law although there are differences; for instance, it uses capital punishment, which Brehon law avoids.

===Canon law===
More contradictions exist with Latin Canon Law, such as in the (Irish Collection of Canons), than with Vernacular Church law. Brehon law allows polygyny (albeit while citing the authority of the Old Testament) and divorce, among other actions that canon law expressly forbids.

At the same time, it is clear that the two legal systems have borrowed from each other. Much Latin terminology has entered into Old Irish and into the legal system, such as a type of witness from Latin . The also borrows terms found in Brehon law such as from Old Irish , a type of surety. The latter also suggests more substantive borrowing from Brehon Law into canon law.

There are a number of places where it is clear that law was borrowed in one direction or another. Large sections on the Church have been translated wholesale from the into a section of the Law tract . Other overlaps have been suggested, in many cases where biblical references seem to appear in the Brehon law. Where both texts cite the same rule, it is not always clear which came up with the rule first. In addition to substantive law, other legal aspects appear in both, such as the propensity towards the use of analogy.

===Relationship of jurists with the church===
The above similarities have led scholars to ask what relationship did Brehons have with clerics. Some scholars, known as anti-nativists, have suggested that the Brehons were nothing more than clerics who had training in secular law. In addition to the similarities and evidence of borrowing from Canon law and the Bible, scholars who hold this position ask how any non-Clerics could have been sufficiently literate at this period to create the texts. Other scholars, known as nativists, have asked how the differences could arise if the authors of canon and secular law were indeed the same.

==Legal texts==
Scholars have found over 100 distinct texts, ranging from complete texts through various degrees of partial preservation—and in some cases only as a name in a list, and even, in one case, a tract that scholars have decided must have existed. Almost all of the secular legal texts existing in various manuscripts have been printed in D.A. Binchy&#x27;s six-volume and a few texts left out of that work made it into another book intended as a companion to the .

A number of the legal texts may be categorised together on account of related authorship. The largest such grouping is the , a collection of at least 47 separate tracts compiled into a single group sometime in the 8th century, though individual tracts vary in date. These tracts were almost certainly written by a variety of authors, though some suggest that certain authors wrote more than one of the included tracts. The collection was apparently made somewhere in the north midlands. The tracts have been subjected to the greatest amount of glossing and commentary in later manuscripts. Moreover, one of the few examples of Old Irish glossing has been given to the various texts of . These glosses were apparently made in Munster.

The text has been arranged into thirds; three was apparently an important number to the Irish. A number of laws were grouped into threes, called &quot;triads&quot;—a practice also common in the Welsh. One scholar has recently suggested that there were a number of groups of six including one single tract, generally from the first third, two contiguous tracts generally in the second third, and three contiguous tracts from the third third. Each group of six is theorised as related to each other in various ways. The prologue ascribes the authorship of the book to a committee of nine appointed by St Patrick to revise the laws. It was composed of three kings, three bishops, and three professors of literature, poetry, and law. Chief among the latter was Dubthach. It became his duty to give a historical retrospect, and in doing so he exhibited &quot;all the judgments of true nature which the Holy Ghost had spoken from the first occupation of this island down to the reception of the faith. What did not clash with the word of God in the written law and in the New Testament and with the consciences of believers was confirmed in the laws of the brehons by Patrick and by the ecclesiastics and chieftains of Ireland. This is the Senchus Mor.&quot;

=== texts===
In addition to the school that produced the , scholars have detected a few other legal schools that produced texts. The next most fully formed is the or school, named after two of the texts it produced. This school, which has been referred to as &quot;poetico-legal&quot;, apparently was located in Munster, based on references to the King of Munster and two monasteries in Munster.

==== and ====
These two texts, the &quot;First Judgment of Privileged Ones&quot; and the &quot;Final Judgment of Privileged Ones&quot; are the later scribal names of two texts are written primarily in the obscure style of poetry. The first describes the roles and status of the church, poets and various other professionals. The final primarily with the status and duties of poets although it contains other material as well. The first is also one of the few early texts scholars have assigned an author to, namely three brothers, , who are a bishop, a poet, and a judge.
The (&quot;Small primer&quot;) is a text on status and has the greatest breadth in coverage, including not only commoners, kings, churchmen and poets, but also a variety of other professional groups, including judges. It does not go into as much detail for each group and level as do other status tracts.

===Other texts===
A number of other texts have not been grouped together as coming from either the same author or from the same school. This doesn&#x27;t mean no affiliation for authors of other texts exists, only that scholars have not been able to find them.

Literally &quot;Shearing of the Court&quot;, Fergus Kelly suggests that this might mean more loosely &quot;court summary&quot; or &quot;synopsis of court procedure.&quot; The text deals with a number of topics for judicial procedure, but most importantly on the role of the various types of sureties. Interesting, it covers the ways that sureties were appointed to their duties, and hence it is informative on the way contracts were created.
&quot;Branched Purchase&quot; is the title of what is perhaps the most well-known tract on status and certainly the most accessible, as a modern printed edition (though not a translation) has been published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. The text goes into details on the grades of commoners and nobility: what property should they own, how large should their house be, how should their clientship be arranged. The text presents a schema that could not have been used in actuality. For instance, it includes clientship information for even the highest nobility, who would not have acted as clients. The text also presents a certain amount of interesting information on the duties of a king.

In addition to the main text, a poem immediately follows in the manuscript, but there has been debate as to whether this is actually a part of the tract.

A two-part text, &quot;On the Binding of Contracts&quot;, deals with when contracts are binding and when they are not. The first section deals with general rules regarding when contracts are binding, including an analogy to the fact that Adam&#x27;s trade of an apple for access to the Garden of Eden was valid even though it was an uneven contract because Adam knew it was such. The second half deals with cases in which a contract may be overturned. The tract is also interesting because it is a collection of material from varying dates and places and as such much more uneven in content than other tracts.
The &quot;Primer of Stipulations&quot; is a text on the status of poets. It includes information on compensation based on status, but it also includes information about the poetic craft such as the number of type of positions one must have to be a certain grade. It also describes the difference between a and a bard.

===Later texts===

While most of the legal tracts were composed during the 7th and 8th centuries, there were some independent tracts, as well as a significant amount of glossing and commentary, often written within a century of when some of the tracts were composed.

====Glosses and commentary====
The most voluminous legal material written after the 8th century takes the form of notes upon that earlier material. There have been numerous questions about the degree to which such glossators understood the material they worked on. It is also possible that in some cases jurists used the earlier material for a legitimate method of explaining how the law had come to work. This material takes two main forms: glossing between the lines of a text, and mini texts that begin with a quote from earlier legal material.

O&#x27;Davoren&#x27;s Glossary, an early modern glossary of Old Irish, preserves many quotes from early Irish legal texts. In many cases, it is the only text that includes certain quotes as well as information about certain whole law tracts. Its primary focus is to list and define certain words, particularly legal terms, and as such has provided significant help in understanding the oldest laws.

====Later legal tracts====
While the majority of legal texts were written before the 9th century, a few were written later. The Middle Irish text, &quot;The Distribution of Cró and Dibad&quot; deals with extracting fines from a killer and dividing a dead man&#x27;s property. Additionally, the legal text &quot;Cóic Conara Fugill&quot; (the Five Paths of Judgment) was originally written during the earliest period but received a number of subsequent recensions afterwards. The text deals with how a court case should proceed based on the substance of the intended argument. It is not clear what distinctions are made in this text.
===Case law===
Early Irish Law is almost completely lacking in case law. What exists are a few brief references in a number of texts, both legal and non-legal, which reference the laws in action. For instance mentions the case of a king who lost his throne because he was blinded by a bee. Additionally, the Latin Life of St. Columba refers to the case of a man who killed another and the subsequent punishment he was to endure.
== Decline of the Brehon laws ==

The first attempt to encroach on Brehon law in Ireland came in 1155 when the English pope Adrian IV issued the papal bull , which sanctioned the Norman Invasion of Ireland. Following the Norman invasion (from 1171), areas under Anglo-Norman control were subject to English law. One of the first changes came with the Synod of Cashel in 1172, which required single marriages to partners that were not closely related, and exempted clergy from paying their share of a family&#x27;s eraic payments.

Henry II, who created the Lordship of Ireland, was also a legal reformer within his empire, and started to centralise the administration of justice and abolish local customary laws. Strongbow was assigned large parts of Leinster in 1170 under the Brehon law by his new father-in-law Dermot McMurrough that were then regranted by Henry. Landowners such as the Earl of Kildare could claim a continuous title that just predated the Lordship itself.

In the centuries that followed, a cultural and military &quot;Gaelic revival&quot; eventually came to cover the larger portion of the island. The majority of Norman barons eventually adopted Irish culture and language, married in with the native Irish, and adopted Irish legal custom. By the 15th century, in the areas outside of the English controlled Pale around Dublin, and some notable areas of joint tradition in northern and eastern Munster, Brehon law became the de facto legal writ.

Nevertheless, the Brehon Laws could never be adopted on an official basis by the English-controlled government of the Lordship of Ireland, although some modernised concepts have been readopted in the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The imposition of the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367 and the policy of Surrender and regrant effectively outlawed Brehon Law. In one exceptional case, vestigial rights have been recognised in recent Irish case law, in reference to the survival of Brehon law-governed customary local fishery rights in Tyrconnell, but these also amounted to an easement under Common Law.

The Tudor conquest of Ireland in the mid-16th century, ending in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603), caused Tanistry and Gavelkind, two cornerstones of the Brehon Laws, to be specifically outlawed in 1600. The extension of English law into Ulster became possible and led in part to the Flight of the Earls in 1607.

Elements of Brehon law operated in dwindling remnants in the Gaeltacht in the west of Ireland and in the Scottish Isles, notable on the isle of Lewis. On Lewis, the chiefs of the Morrison clan (earlier, Clann mhic Amhlaigh (Macaulays) of Uig in Lewis, and Sliochd a&#x27; Bhreitheimh, later Morrison) continued to hold office as hereditary brieves (Scots for or &quot;brehon&quot;) or judges of the MacLeod clan of Lewis into the 17th century.
The last Morrison to exercise the office was put down with Letter of Fire and Sword in about 1619. It is probable that it was the last operative in Lewis by about 1595 or so. See the later history of Clan Morrison.

== Fictional references and Ulster cycle of legends ==
The Brehon laws play a large role in the Sister Fidelma series of historical (7th century AD) crime books by Peter Tremayne, and in those of Cora Harrison&#x27;s Mara, Brehon (investigating judge) of the Burren (early 16th century).
They are also the underlying principles seen in such Irish saga as Táin Bó Flidhais and Táin Bó Cuailnge

==March law==

March law was a set of laws and customs obtaining in the border areas of the Lordship of Ireland during the Middle Ages. These regions were ruled by Anglo-Irish lords between The Pale, which was the portion of Ireland ruled directly by the English crown, and Gaelic Ireland, which was still under the rule of native kings. It came into being in the late 13th century, when King Edward I of England drained resources from Ireland to fund his conquest of Wales and his wars in Scotland. Since the two areas were often intermingled in the border regions, as in the Wicklow Mountains, the applicability and content of march law varied widely.

<text>Taitung County (; Paiwan: &quot;Valangaw&quot;) is the third largest county in Taiwan, located primarily on the island&#x27;s southeastern coast and also including Green Island, Orchid Island and Lesser Orchid Island. The seat is located in Taitung City.

==Name==
While its name means &quot;Eastern Taiwan&quot;, it is also known as &quot;Houshan&quot; () by many of the locals, meaning behind the mountains or the back mountains.

==History==
===Qing dynasty===
In 1887, the new Fujian-Taiwan Province included Taitung Prefecture as one of four prefectures.

===Empire of Japan===

During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, Taitung County was administered as Taitō Prefecture.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945, Taitung was established as a county of Taiwan Province on 25 December the same year.

==Geography==

Taitung runs along the southeastern coast of Taiwan. Taitung County, controlling is the 3rd largest county in Taiwan after Hualien County and Nantou County. Mainland Taitung County&#x27;s coastline is long. The Huatung Valley runs along the northern half of the county. Taitung currently has a population of 234,123.

Due in part to its remote location and isolation by mountains from Taiwan&#x27;s main population centers, Taitung was the last part of the island to be colonized by Han Chinese immigrants (late 19th century). Throughout the 20th century Taitung remained an economic backwater. Sparsely populated even today, this isolation may have been a blessing in disguise, as Taitung mostly escaped the urbanization and pollution that have come to plague much of the island&#x27;s lowland areas.

In addition to the area on Taiwan proper, the county includes two major islands, Green Island or Isla Verde and Orchid Island. Green Island was home to an infamous penal colony used for political prisoners during the &quot;White Terror&quot; period of Chinese Nationalist (KMT) rule (from 1947 until the end of martial law in 1987). Orchid Island, home of the Tao people (Taiwanese aborigines closely related to the people of the northern Philippines), has become a major tourist attraction despite the government-operated Taiwan Power Company&#x27;s controversial use of part of the island as a nuclear waste dump.

==Government==


===Administrative divisions===
Taitung County is divided into 1 city, 2 urban townships, 8 rural townships and 5 mountain indigenous townships. Taitung County has the second highest number of mountain indigenous townships in Taiwan after Pingtung County. The seat of the county is located at Taitung City, where it houses the Taitung County Government and Taitung County Council. The current Magistrate of Taitung County is April Yao of the Kuomintang. After streamlining of Taiwan Province in 1998, the county has since directly governed by the Executive Yuan.
Colors indicates the common languages status of Hakka and Formosan languages within each division.

===Politics===
Taitung County elected one Democratic Progressive Party legislator to the Legislative Yuan during the 2016 legislative election.

==Demographics==

Taitung County is home to seven aboriginal ethnics, including Amis, Bunun, Kavalan, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai and Yami. Taitung County has the largest aboriginal to overall population of a county or city in Taiwan, at 35.5%.

==Education==
Education in Taitung County is administered under the Education Department of the Taitung County Government.
* National Taitung University
* National Taitung Junior College

==Culture==
Taitung County possesses a very diverse collection of aboriginal cultures. Because Taitung is probably one of the least affected counties by the settlement of the Han Chinese, most of the aboriginal cultures are still very much a part of everyday society.

==Energy==
Taitung County houses the Lanyu Power Plant, a 6.5 MW fuel-fired power plant located in Orchid Island.

<doc id="720489" wikidata="Q3505393" url="?curid=720489" title="Nicknames of politicians and personalities in Quebec">
<text>A custom of Quebecers is to give nicknames to their politicians (and some personalities), most especially their Premiers. Many of those given to Premiers are affectionate or even express admiration, while others are insulting.

==Nicknames of Quebec Premiers==
* Maurice Duplessis (1936–1939 and 1944–1959): Le Chef &quot;(&quot;The Leader&quot; or &quot;The Chief&quot;)&quot;. Often pronounced (and even spelled) &quot;Le Cheuf&quot;, to reflect an old-fashioned joual pronunciation of the word.
** Often used disparagingly to evoke Duplessis&#x27;s despotism. Nevertheless, he apparently used the nickname to refer to himself.
* Daniel Johnson Sr. (1966–1968): Danny Boy.
** Name given to the portrayal of Johnson as a comical and clueless cowboy in political cartoons drawn by Normand Hudon before Johnson taking power. An apparent reference to his Irish roots.
* Robert Bourassa (1970–1976 and 1985–1994)
** Boubou.
*** Also inspired the term &quot;Boubou Macoutes&quot;.
** L&#x27;homme le plus détesté du Québec &quot;(&quot;The most hated man of Quebec&quot;)&quot;.
*** A term used by historians to denote the unpopularity of Bourassa and his government before first losing power to René Lévesque&#x27;s Parti Québécois in 1976.
** Bourassa I; Bourassa II.
***Terms historians use to refer to Bourassa and his governments under his first two mandates and his last two mandates as Premier, respectively.
* René Lévesque (1976–1985): Ti-Poil &quot;(literally, &quot;Lil&#x27; Hair&quot;, but more accurately translated as &quot;Baldy&quot;)&quot;.
** A reminder of his often ruffled comb-over.
* Jacques Parizeau (1994–1996): Monsieur &quot;(&quot;Sir&quot;)&quot;.
** Positive and relatively appreciative reference to his well-known aristocratic pride and assurance. Source of the title of a 2003 documentary, &quot;Monsieur&quot; about Parizeau.
* Lucien Bouchard (1996–2001):
** Lulu.
** Barbe Bleue.
* Jean Charest (2003–2012): Charest has gained numerous nicknames:
**Patapouf or Patapouf Premier &quot;(&quot;Patapouf the First&quot;)&quot;.
***The name was rumoured to be a nickname given by Charest&#x27;s wife, something he denied. It first came to be used in the campaign Destituons Patapouf!, an operation of disgruntled citizens who spread a petition from 2003 to 2004 to have Charest recalled, not unlike California governor Gray Davis. Loco Locass (music group), in their song Libérez-nous des libéraux (&quot;Free us from the liberals&quot;) used this nickname to refer to him. The word is an archetypal name for a clown in Quebec French (like Bozo). It is also a pejorative way to talk about someone fat, so it could refer to the fact that he gained some weight. Patapouf Premier is a sarcastic variant that paints Charest as a farcical, despotic monarch. Both are used mockingly.
**Le Frisé &quot;(&quot;Curly&quot;)&quot;.
***Referring to his famous curly hair. It is negative. A humorous, mocking song from irony rocker Mononc&#x27; Serge about the man is entitled &quot;Le Frisé&quot;.
**Le p&#x27;tit Saint-Jean-Baptiste &quot;(&quot;Lil&#x27; Saint John the Baptist&quot;)&quot;.
***The Saint-Jean-Baptiste parades of the first half of the 20th century usually featured a curly-haired boy representing Saint John the Baptist. It is therefore another stab at Charest&#x27;s hairstyle; tied in is the fact that Charest&#x27;s date of birth is June 24, the feast of John the Baptist.
**Le mouton &quot;(&quot;The Sheep&quot;)&quot;
***Another reference to his curly hair. Due to Google bombing, a search using Google&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; option for &quot;mouton insignifiant&quot; (&quot;insignificant sheep&quot;) used to link to Charest&#x27;s official MNA webpage.
* Pauline Marois (2012–2014):
**Dame de béton &quot;(&quot;The Concrete Lady&quot;)&quot;
***In reference to her toughness and that she had survived several challenges to her leadership from prominent members of her caucus.
* Philippe Couillard (2014–2018):
**The Bear
***In reference to his beard, build and ambling gait.
**Philippe-Flop
***Used by opposition parties as a pejorative against him, due to perceived shifting of his position on issues.

==Similar nicknames==
*Louis St. Laurent (Prime Minister of Canada from 1948 to 1957): Oncle Louis &quot;(&quot;Uncle Louis&quot;)&quot;.
* Camillien Houde (Four-time Mayor of Montreal from the 1920s to the 1950s): Monsieur Montréal.
* Pacifique Plante (crimefighting lawyer from the 1940s to the 1950s): Pax Plante.
* Pierre Elliott Trudeau (Prime Minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984): Ti-Pet &quot;(&quot;Lil&#x27; Fart&quot;)&quot; or Pet
** Always derogatory. Trudeau&#x27;s initials, P.E.T., were often used in English Canada as alternative naming, and &quot;pet&quot; (actual spelling &quot;pète&quot; but identical pronunciation) is French for fart. Since Trudeau was in power for many of the same years as Lévesque, the two were sometimes referenced humorously as &quot;Ti-Pet et Ti-Poil&quot;. These initials were also popularly used to parody Petro-Canada, the name of the nationalized oil and gas company founded during Trudeau&#x27;s reign.
* Brian Mulroney (Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1993): Lyin&#x27; Brian; le p&#x27;tit gars de Baie-Comeau &quot;(&quot;Little Guy from Baie-Comeau&quot;)&quot;, &quot;The chin that walks like a man&quot; (a moniker given to him by columnist Allan Fotheringham), and &quot;Mini Trudeau&quot; (a name given to him by René Lévesque for perceived similarities to Pierre Elliot Trudeau)
** Mulroney was born and raised in Baie-Comeau, a city in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec.
* Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister of Canada from 1993 to 2003): le p&#x27;tit gars de Shawinigan &quot;(&quot;Little Guy from Shawinigan&quot;)&quot;.
** Chrétien received a similar nickname to Mulroney&#x27;s. This refers to his own city of origin, Shawinigan, Quebec. Chrétien sometimes spoke of himself that way.
* Mario Dumont (leader of the Action Démocratique from 1994 to 2009): Super Mario.
**A common criticism of Dumont was his relatively young age. Super Mario is both a comment on his youth (referring to the Nintendo video game series Super Mario Bros., popular among children) and an ironic glorification of his underdog popularity. Rap group Loco Locass wrote a song called Super Mario in reference of Dumont. Since the election of 2007, when his party won 41 seats, after having won just 5 in the previous election), the nickname &quot;Super Mario&quot; isn&#x27;t always pejorative
* Amir Khadir (leader and MNA of Québec solidaire): &quot;Godasse Khadir&quot; (in French slang, godasse means &quot;old shoe&quot;). Khadir was nicknamed Godasse after throwing a shoe on an effigy of George W. Bush in 2008, during a protest held in Montreal for journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi, famous for throwing a pair of shoes at the U.S. president in Iraq.
* Jack Layton (leader of the New Democratic Party): &quot;le bon Jack&quot; (&quot;un bon jack&quot; meaning a nice guy).
*Thomas Mulcair (leader of the New Democratic Party) &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, for diametrically opposed views that he publicly states depending on the language and/or the province in which he delivers the message.
* Justin Trudeau (current Prime Minister of Canada): &quot;Mini-pet&quot;, in relation to his aforementioned father&#x27;s nickname.

<text>Thomas Crosbie Holdings (TCH) was a family-owned media and publishing group based in Cork, Ireland. Its largest publication was once the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;, the third largest daily broadsheet newspaper in the Republic of Ireland.

==History and receivership==
In July 2012, it was reported by RTÉ that Thomas Crosbie Holdings were considering a &quot;debt restructuring&quot;. On 20 January 2013, it was reported that TCH &quot;is edging closer to making a tough decision on its financial restructuring&quot;.

TCH employed 800 people at one stage, this dropped to 640. In a 2013 court case the company said &quot;everyone in the organisation, was highly attuned to the fact it was a difficult business&quot;.

On 6 March 2013, TCH went into receivership. &quot;Landmark Media Investments&quot; Ltd acquired most of the old TCH assets.

Thomas Crosbie Holdings was sued by WebPrint Concepts in March 2013. WebPrint Concepts also sued Landmark Media Investments. Both were sued over breach of contract. WebPrint Concepts subsequently fired 26 staff members after losing the Thomas Crosbie Holdings contract.

TCH formerly owned a number of newspapers and radio stations as listed below.

<doc id="720501" wikidata="Q193987" url="?curid=720501" title="James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster">
<text>Lieutenant-General James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster, PC (Ire) (29 May 1722 – 19 November 1773), styled Lord Offaly until 1743 and known as The Earl of Kildare between 1743 and 1761 and as The Marquess of Kildare between 1761 and 1766, was an Anglo-Irish nobleman, soldier and politician.

==Background==
Leinster was the son of Robert FitzGerald, 19th Earl of Kildare, and Lady Mary, daughter of William O&#x27;Brien, 3rd Earl of Inchiquin.

==Career==
Leinster was a member of the Irish House of Commons for Athy from 1741 before succeeding his father as 20th Earl of Kildare in 1743. He was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1746 and in 1747, on the occasion of his marriage (see below), he was created Viscount Leinster, of Taplow in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and took his seat in the British House of Lords that same year. From 1749 to 1755 he was one of the leaders of the Popular Party in Ireland, and served as the country&#x27;s Master-General of the Ordnance between 1758 and 1766, becoming Colonel of the Royal Irish Artillery in 1760. He was promoted to Major-General in 1761 and to Lieutenant-General in 1770.

In 1761 Lord Kildare was created Earl of Offaly and Marquess of Kildare in the Peerage of Ireland and in 1766 he was further honoured when he was made Duke of Leinster, becoming by this time the Premier Duke, Marquess and Earl in the Peerage of Ireland.

==Family==
Leinster married the 15-year-old Lady Emily Lennox (6 October 1731 – London, 27 March 1814), daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and one of the famous Lennox Sisters, in London on 7 February 1747. She was a great-granddaughter of King Charles II and was therefore a distant fifth cousin of King George III (both of them were descended from King James VI and I). The couple had nineteen children:
*George FitzGerald, Earl of Offaly (15 January 1748 – Richmond House, 26 September 1765).
*William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster (Arlington Place, Piccadilly, London, 12 March 1749 – Carton House, Kildare, 20 October 1804).
*Lady Caroline FitzGerald (1750 – 1754).
*Lady Emily Mary FitzGerald (15 March 1751 – 8 April 1818), married Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont and Baron Coote of Coolony. The couple had five children, one son who died young (born 1776) and four daughters. Emily died in Penzance, Cornwall in 1818 after a lingering illness.
*Lady Henrietta FitzGerald (1753 – 1763).
*Lady Caroline FitzGerald (born and died 1755).
*Charles FitzGerald, 1st Baron Lecale (30 June 1756 – 30 June 1810).
*Lady Charlotte Mary Gertrude FitzGerald (29 May 1758 – 13 September 1836), married Joseph Strutt and was made first Baroness Rayleigh. Had issue.
*Lady Louisa Bridget FitzGerald (1760 – 1765).
*Lord Henry FitzGerald (30 July 1761 – 8 July 1829), general; married Charlotte Boyle and had issue, who take by inheritance the surname &quot;de Ros&quot;.
*Lady Sophia Sarah Mary FitzGerald (1762 – 21 March 1845).
*Lord Edward FitzGerald (15 October 1763 – 4 June 1798), revolutionary and prominent leader of the United Irishmen during the 1798 rising.
*Lord Robert Stephen FitzGerald (1765 – 2 January 1833), a diplomat; married Sophia Charlotte Fielding and had issue.
*Lord Gerald FitzGerald (January 1766 – 1788). Drowned, went down with the ship in which he was serving.
*Lord Augustus FitzGerald (1767 – 1771).
*Lady Fanny FitzGerald (1770 – 1775).
*Lady Lucy Anne FitzGerald (1771 – 1851), who took part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. She was married to Admiral Sir Thomas Foley, who served with distinction under Lord Nelson. They had no children.
*Lady Louisa FitzGerald (1772 – 1776).
*Lord George Simon FitzGerald (16 April 1773 – 1783). Recognized as a son of Lord Kildare, but was in fact the biological son of his brother&#x27;s tutor, William Ogilvie.

Leinster died at Leinster House, Dublin, in November 1773, aged 51, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Christ Church Cathedral. He was succeeded by his second (but eldest surviving) son, William, Marquess of Kildare. The Duchess of Leinster caused a minor sensation by marrying her lover William Ogilvie in 1774, but continued to be known as The Dowager Duchess of Leinster. She had a further three children by him. She died in London in March 1814, aged 82.

==Popular culture==
In 1999, Irish Screen, BBC America and WGBH produced &quot;Aristocrats&quot;, a six-part limited television series based on the lives of Emily Lennox and her sisters. Leinster was portrayed by Ben Daniels.

<text>Milovan Drecun ( born 4 October 1957) is a Serbian journalist and politician. A member of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), he has been an MP in the Serbian parliament since 2012.

During the 1990s Drecun worked as correspondent at the state-owned broadcaster RTS. In parallel, he maintained a career in politics. As member of the Serbian Revival, he was a candidate at the 2004 Serbian presidential elections receiving 0.54% of the popular vote.

==Early life==
Drecun was born in Vranje, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. He is of Montenegrin descent. Drecun completed primary school in Surdulica before moving to Vladičin Han for high school studies. He then enrolled at the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Political Sciences, graduating in 1981.

==Journalism career==
Drecun&#x27;s first journalistic experience was with &quot;Narodna armija&quot; (People&#x27;s Army), a magazine published by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). In 1992, following the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia, the magazine was renamed &quot;Vojska&quot;.

In 1993 he started working for the state-owned public broadcaster RTS where he remained until the end of Kosovo War in June 1999. During those six years Drecun was a war correspondent for the state television&#x27;s main channel RTS 1, getting dispatched to Bosnia and Croatia during the Yugoslav Wars.

He was banned from national TV after the Kosovo War. He occasionally works for foreign corporations. He has written two books about the conflict in the Kosovo War - &quot;The Second Battle of Kosovo&quot; (Други Косовски Бој) and &quot;Kosmet Legend&quot; (Косметска легенда), he also wrote &quot;Brate gde je nasa Srbija&quot;(Brother where is our Serbia), &quot;Rat za Kosovo&quot;(War for Kosovo), and his latest work &quot;Alahovi ratnici&quot; (Allah&#x27;s warriors), is about global terrorism.

==Political career==
In 1996, Drecun joined the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), a ruling party in Serbia headed at the time by Slobodan Milošević.

In early 2000 Drecun formed his own political party called Serbian Revival.

In June 2011, Drecun joined the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) led at the time by Tomislav Nikolić, which was in opposition. Drecun was on the SNS-led coalition electoral list for the 2012 parliamentary election where the list won slightly over 24% of the popular vote, which was good for 57 parliamentary seats. Drecun thus became an MP in the National Assembly.

<text>The Battle of the Hydaspes also known as Battle of Jhelum, or First Battle of Jhelum, was fought between Alexander the Great and Porus in May of 326 BCE. It took place on the banks of the Hydaspes River in what is now the Punjab province of Pakistan, as part of Alexander&#x27;s Indian campaign. In what was possibly their most costly engagement, the Macedonian army secured a decisive victory over the Pauravas and captured Porus. Large areas of Punjab were subsequently absorbed into the Macedonian Empire; Porus was reinstated as the region&#x27;s ruler after Alexander, having developed a newfound respect for the fierce resistance put up by Porus and his army, appointed him as a satrap.

Despite close surveillance by the Pauravas, Alexander&#x27;s decision to cross the monsoon-swollen Hydaspes to catch Porus&#x27; army in the flank has been called one of his &quot;masterpieces&quot; in combat. The Macedonians&#x27; engagement with the Indians at Hydaspes remains a very significant historical event during the Wars of Alexander the Great, as it resulted in the exposure of Greek political and cultural influences to the Indian subcontinent, which would continue to affect Greeks and Indians for centuries to come.

After the battle, Alexander continued his eastward march into modern-day India, intending to cross the Ganges River. However, he stopped at the Hyphasis (now called the Beas) in 326 BC after his weary troops refused to advance further, having campaigned with him for nearly eight years. Arms and armor were also wearing out, and there was concern within the army that they could meet disaster in India. The Hyphasis marked the farthest advance of Alexander in India, and upon leaving, he &quot;left King Porus in charge of this easternmost territory.&quot;

After Alexander defeated the last of the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s forces under Bessus and Spitamenes in 328 BC, he began a new campaign to further extend his empire towards India in 327 BC. After fortifying Bactria with 10,000 men, Alexander commenced his invasion of India through the Khyber Pass. Whilst possessing a much larger army, at the battle, an estimated 40,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry crossed the river in time to engage the enemy. During this battle, Alexander suffered heavy losses compared to his earlier victories.

The primary Greek column entered the Khyber Pass, but a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander went through the northern route, taking the fortress of Aornos (modern-day Pir-Sar) along the way—a place of mythological significance to the Greeks as, according to legend, Herakles had failed to occupy it when he campaigned in India. Here, the Hindu clans of the Hindu Kush gave Alexander&#x27;s army the toughest opposition they had faced, but Alexander still emerged victorious, despite being outnumbered, depending on the source, somewhere between 3:1 and 5:1.

In early spring of the next year, Alexander formed an alliance with Taxiles (local name Ambhi), the King of Taxila. They combined their forces against Taxiles&#x27; neighbour, the King of Hydaspes, Porus the Elder, who had chosen to spurn Alexander&#x27;s command for him to surrender and was preparing for war. Alexander had to subdue Porus in order to keep marching east. To leave such a strong opponent at his flanks would have endangered any further exploits. Alexander could not afford to show any weakness if he wanted to keep the loyalty of the already subdued Indian princes. Porus had to defend his kingdom and chose the perfect spot to check Alexander&#x27;s advance. Although he lost the battle, he became Alexander&#x27;s most successful recorded opponent. According to historian Peter Green, Porus&#x27; performance in the battle out-classed both Memnon of Rhodes and Spitamenes.

==Pre-battle manoeuvres==
Alexander fixed his camp on the north banks of the Jhelum River (then called the Hydaspes). In the spring of 326 BC, Porus drew up on the south bank of the Hydaspes to repel any crossing. The Jhelum River was deep and fast enough that any attempt at a crossing would probably doom the attacking force. Alexander knew that a direct approach had little chance of success and tried to find alternative fords. He moved his mounted troops up and down the river bank each night while Porus shadowed him.

Eventually, Alexander found and used a suitable crossing, about upstream of his camp. This was where an uninhabited, wood-covered island divided the river. While leading his troops across, he landed on the island, while his troops waded across. His plan was a classic pincer manoeuvre. He would eventually attack Indian cavalry flanking both sides of Porus&#x27; main force from the right. He left his general, Craterus, behind with most of the army, to make sure Porus would not find out about his crossing, while he crossed the river upstream with a strong contingent, consisting, according to the 2nd century AD Greek historian Arrian, of 6,000 on foot and 5,000 on horseback, though it was probably larger. Craterus was ordered to ford the river and attack if Porus faced Alexander with all his troops or to hold his position if Porus faced Alexander with only part of his army. The other forces commanded by Meleager, Attalus, and Gorgias were ordered to cross the river in various places during the manoeuvre.

Alexander&#x27;s crossing the Hydaspes in the face of Indian forces on the opposite bank was a notable achievement. The complex preparations for the crossing were accomplished using numerous feints and other forms of deception. Porus was kept continuously on the move until he decided it was a bluff and relaxed. On every visit to the crossing site, Alexander made a detour inland to maintain the secrecy of the plan. It was also reported that an Alexander look-alike held sway in a mock royal tent near the base.

Alexander quietly moved his part of the army upstream and then traversed the river in utmost secrecy, using &#x27;skin floats filled with hay&#x27; as well as &#x27;smaller vessels cut in half, the thirty oared galleys into three&#x27;. Furthermore, Craterus engaged in frequent feints suggesting that he may cross the river. As a result, Porus, &#x27;no longer expecting a sudden attempt under cover of darkness, was lulled into a sense of security.&#x27; Alexander mistakenly landed on an island, but soon crossed to the other side. Porus perceived his opponent&#x27;s manoeuvre and sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son, also named Porus, to fight them off, hoping that he could prevent his crossing. By chance, a storm occurred that night, which drowned out the sounds of the crossing.

Having crossed the river, Alexander advanced towards the location of Porus&#x27; camp with all his horsemen and foot archers, leaving his phalanx to follow up behind. Upon meeting with young Porus&#x27; force, his horse archers showered the latter with arrows, while his heavy cavalry immediately charged without forming into line of battle. Young Porus also faced an unexpected disadvantage: his chariots were immobilized by the mud near the shore of the river. His small force was completely routed by Alexander&#x27;s outnumbering cavalry, and he died. As news reached the elder Porus, he understood that Alexander had crossed to his side of the river and hastened to face him with the best part of his army, leaving behind a small detachment to disrupt the landing of Craterus&#x27; force should he attempt to cross the river.

==Battle==

Eventually the two forces met and arrayed themselves for the battle. The Indians were poised with cavalry on both flanks, fronted by their chariots, while their center comprising infantry with war elephants stationed every fifty feet in front of them, to deter the Macedonian cavalry. The Indian war elephants were heavily armoured and had castle-like howdahs on their back carrying a trio of archers and javelin men. Porus&#x27; soldiers were dressed in flamboyantly hued outfits with steel helmets, bright scarves and baldrics, and wielded axes, lances and maces. Porus, eschewing the usual tradition of Indian kings fighting from a chariot, was mounted atop his tallest war elephant. This animal in particular was not equipped with a howdah, as the king was clad in chain mail armour and hence had no need of the additional protection of a tower.

Alexander, noticing that Porus&#x27; disposition was strongest in the center, decided to attack with his cavalry first on the flanks, having his phalanx hold back until the Indian cavalry had been neutralized. The Macedonian heavy infantry phalanx were outnumbered 1:5 against the Indian infantry. However the latter were at significant disadvantage in close combat due to their lack of armour and the long reach of their opponent&#x27;s sarissas. Even their heavy armour-piercing bows were inaccurate because of the slippery ground, though the muddy ground was also an advantage to the lighter-armored Indians.

Alexander commenced the battle by sending his Dahae horse archers to harass the Indian right-wing cavalry. His armoured Companion cavalry was sent to attack their outnumbered Indian counterparts on the left wing, with Alexander himself leading the charge as was his habit. The rest of the Indian cavalry galloped to the aid of their hard-pressed kinsmen from the right wing, but Coenus&#x27;s squadrons promptly followed their movement and attacked them from the rear. The Indian horsemen tried to form a double phalanx to face both attacks, but the necessary complicated manoeuvres brought even more confusion into their ranks, making it easier for the Macedonian cavalry to defeat them. The Indian cavalry were thus routed, and fled to the safety of their elephants.

The war elephants now advanced against the Macedonian cavalry, only to be confronted by the Macedonian phalanx. The powerful beasts caused heavy losses among the Macedonian foot, impaling many men with their steel-clad tusks and heaving some of them into the air before pulverizing them, and trampling and disorganizing their dense lines. Nevertheless, the Macedonian infantry resisted the attack bravely, with light infantry who tossed javelins at the elephants&#x27; mahouts and eyes while the heavy infantry attempted to hamstring the elephants with the two-sided axes and kopis. Meanwhile, the Indian horsemen attempted another sally, only to be repulsed once again by Alexander&#x27;s cavalry squadrons, who had all massed together. The elephants were eventually repulsed and fled back to their own lines. Many of their mahouts had been struck down by Macedonian missiles before they could kill their panicked mounts with poisoned rods, and hence the maddened animals wrought enormous havoc, trampling many of their own infantry and cavalry to death. Finally, the Macedonian pezhetairoi locked their shields and advanced upon the confused enemy mass, while the Macedonian cavalry charged from the rear in a classic &quot;hammer and anvil&quot; manoeuvre, putting the entire Indian army to rout. Meanwhile, Craterus and his force in the base camp had succeeded in crossing the river, and arriving just at the right moment proceed to conduct a thorough pursuit on the fleeing Indians.

Throughout the battle, Alexander is said to have observed with growing admiration the valour of Porus, and understood that Porus intended to die in combat rather than be captured. Hoping to save the life of such a competent leader and warrior, Alexander commanded Taxiles to summon Porus for surrender. However, Porus became enraged on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear at him in fury without bothering to listen to his proposal. Porus&#x27; aggressive response forced Taxiles to take flight on his steed. In a similar manner, many other messengers dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned until at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus, convinced him to listen to Alexander&#x27;s message. Overpowered by thirst, the weary Porus finally dismounted his war elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, he allowed himself to be taken to Alexander. On hearing that the Indian King was approaching, Alexander himself rode out to meet him and the famous surrender meeting took place.

According to Arrian, Macedonian losses amounted to 80 foot soldiers, ten horse archers, twenty of the Companions and 200 other horsemen. However the military historian J.F.C. Fuller saw Diodorus&#x27; report of casualties of 1000 men killed as more realistic. This was certainly a high figure for the victorious army, and more than the Macedonian losses at Gaugamela, yet not improbable considering the partial success of the Indian war elephants. Indian losses amounted to 23,000 according to Arrian, 12,000 dead and over 9,000 men captured according to Diodorus. The last two numbers are remarkably close, so it might be assumed that Arrian added any prisoners to the total Indian casualties. Among the Indian leadership, two sons of Porus and his relative and ally Spitakes were killed during the battle, as well as most of his chieftains. Around 80 elephants were captured alive. Alexander also acquired an additional 70 war elephants due to the late arrival of reinforcements called for by King Porus after the battle was already over, who readily surrendered and offered these beasts as a tribute.

==Aftermath and legacy==
When asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated, Porus replied &quot;Treat me as a king would treat another king&quot;. Impressed, Alexander indeed treated him like a king, allowing him to retain his lands. Following the battle, Alexander founded two cities called Boukephala and Nikaia, the latter at the site of the battle and named after the Greek word for victory, Nike, in commemoration of his success, and the former on the opposite bank to honour his faithful steed Bucephalus, who died during or after the battle.

In 326 BC, Alexander&#x27;s army approached the boundaries of the Nanda Empire. His army, exhausted from the continuous campaigning and concerned at the prospect of facing yet another gigantic Indian army, demanded that they should return to the west. This happened at the Hyphasis (modern Beas). Historians do not consider that this action by Alexander&#x27;s troops represented a mutiny but called it an increase in military unrest amongst the troops, which forced Alexander to finally give in. Instead of immediately turning back, however, he ordered the army to march south, along the Indus, securing the banks of the river as the borders of his empire.
The main reasons for Porus&#x27; defeat were Alexander&#x27;s use of clever tactics, and the Macedonians&#x27; superior discipline and technology. The Indians used chariots which were inferior to the Greek&#x27;s cavalry. They did not have a well supported military infrastructure or a standing army. The Indian infantry and cavalry were poorly armoured, lacking in metal armour, and their swords were no match against the sarissa of the Macedonians. Porus himself failed to take the initiative, mainly trying to counter his opponent&#x27;s moves. Greek historians agree that Porus fought bravely until the end.

During the later rule of the Maurya Empire, tactician Kautilya took the Battle of the Hydaspes as a lesson and highlighted the need for military training before battle. The first Mauryan emperor, Chandragupta, maintained a standing army. The chariot corps played a marginal role in Mauryan military infrastructure.

<doc id="720557" wikidata="Q34071" url="?curid=720557" title="President of Paraguay">
<text>The president of Paraguay (), officially known as the president of the Republic of Paraguay (), is the head of the executive branch of the government of Paraguay, serving as both head of state and head of government according to the Constitution of Paraguay. His honorific title is &quot;Su Excelencia&quot;.

The incumbent president of Paraguay is Santiago Peña, who took office on 15 August 2023. The presidential seat is the Palacio de los López, in Asunción. The presidential residence is the Mburuvichá Roga, also in Asunción. Once presidents leave office, they are granted by the Constitution of Paraguay the speaking-but-non-voting position of senator for life.

== Features of the office ==

=== Requirements ===
Article 228 of the Constitution establishes that the president must be a naturalized citizen, be at least 35 years old, and have full political and civil rights.

=== Election ===
Article 230 of the Constitution establishes that the president and the vice president must be elected in a joint ticket by a single round of direct vote, in an election taking place between 90 and 120 days before the expiration of the previous presidential term (per Article 229, August 15). Article 229 also establishes that the president serves a single term of 5 years and is forbidden to be re-elected under any circumstances, and that the vice president must resign from their role 6 months before the election, if they decide to run for the presidency.

The re-election ban dates back to the aftermath of the Alfredo Stroessner dictatorship, in which Stroessner was re-elected without term limits. An attempt by the Senate to abolish term limits on 1 April 2017 resulted in protests; it was ultimately rejected.

== Powers and duties ==
According to Article 238 of the Constitution, the president&#x27;s duties are:

#Representing the State and direct the general administration of the country.
#Comply with and enforce the Constitution and its laws.
#Participating in the formation of laws.
#Veto laws passed by Congress.
#Issue decrees that require the endorsement of the Minister of the branch.
#Appoint and remove by itself the ministers of the Executive Branch, the Attorney General of the Republic and the officials of the Public Administration.
#The management of the foreign relations of the Republic.
#Report to Congress of the efforts carried out by the Executive Branch, as well as report on the general situation of the Republic and plans for the future.
#Being the Commander in Chief of the Nation&#x27;s Armed Forces.
#Pardon or commute sentences imposed by the judges and courts of the Republic, and with a report from the Supreme Court of Justice.
#Convene extraordinary sessions of Congress.
#Proposing bills to Congress.
#Prepare and present the annual project of the General Budget of the Nation

== Succession ==
Article 234 of the Constitution establishes that in the event of impediment or absence of the offices of the President and Vice President, the Presidency of the Republic shall be assumed by, in order of succession, the President of the Senate, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice.

== Residence ==
The Mburuvicha Róga in Asunción is the official residence of the president. It was first built in 1930.

The Palacio de los López is the president&#x27;s workplace, located in the center of Asunción. It was first built in orders of Paraguay&#x27;s first president Carlos Antonio López in 1844, and was planned to be handed to his son and designated successor, Francisco Solano López. It was completed in 1867, in the midst of the Paraguayan War, and thus it was never used by Solano López. The Palace was heavily damaged in the war, and it was not until 1894 that it was finally restored and repaired by Juan Bautista Egusquiza, who was the first president to establish the Palace as his official workplace.

<text>General Charles Richard Fox (6 November 1796 – 13 April 1873) was a British army general, and later a politician.

==Background==

Fox was born at Brompton, the illegitimate son of Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, through a liaison with Lady Webster, whom Lord Holland would later marry.

==Career==
After some service in the Royal Navy, Fox entered the Grenadiers, and was known in later life as a collector of Greek coins. His collection was bought for the royal museum of Berlin when he died in 1873. He was present around the time of Napoleon&#x27;s incarceration on St Helena and subsequently removed a key to the bedroom where Napoleon was lodged. This was given to his mother - Lady Holland - due to her Napoleonphile attitudes and auctioned in 2021. He married in St. George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, on 19 June 1824 Lady Mary FitzClarence, a daughter of William IV by his mistress Dorothy Jordan. The couple had no issue.

Fox was also a politician. He represented the Whig interest and sat for Calne 1831–32, then Tavistock 1832–35. He briefly represented Stroud in 1835, but resigned that seat so Lord John Russell could contest it. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the east London constituency of Tower Hamlets in 1841 and served until 1847.

Fox was Surveyor-General of the Ordnance in 1841 and 1846–52. He was promoted Major-General on 9 November 1846, Lieutenant-General on 20 June 1854, and General on 6 March 1863.

<doc id="720564" wikidata="Q318508" url="?curid=720564" title="Andrés Manuel López Obrador">
<text>Andrés Manuel López Obrador (; born 13 November 1953), also known by his initials AMLO, is a Mexican politician who served as the 65th president of Mexico from 2018 to 2024. He previously served as Head of Government of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005.

Born in Tepetitán, in the municipality of Macuspana, in the south-eastern state of Tabasco, López Obrador earned a degree in political science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico following a hiatus from his studies to participate in politics. He began his political career in 1976 as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). His first public position was as director of the Indigenous Institute of Tabasco, where he promoted the addition of books in indigenous languages. In 1989, he joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), becoming the party&#x27;s 1994 candidate for Governor of Tabasco and national leader between 1996 and 1999. In 2000, he was elected Head of Government of Mexico City. During his tenure, his crime, infrastructure, and social spending policies made him a popular figure on the Mexican left. In 2004, his state immunity from prosecution was removed after he refused to cease construction on land allegedly expropriated by his predecessor, Rosario Robles. This legal process lasted a year, ending with López Obrador maintaining his right to run for office.

López Obrador was nominated as the presidential candidate for the Coalition for the Good of All during the 2006 elections, where he was narrowly defeated by the National Action Party (PAN) candidate Felipe Calderón. While the Federal Electoral Tribunal noted some irregularities, it denied López Obrador&#x27;s request for a general recount, which sparked protests nationwide. In 2011, he founded Morena, a civil association and later political party. He was a candidate for the Progressive Movement coalition in the 2012 elections, won by the Commitment to Mexico coalition candidate Enrique Peña Nieto. In 2012, he left the PRD after protesting the party&#x27;s signing of the Pact for Mexico and joined Morena. As part of the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition, López Obrador was elected president after a landslide victory in the 2018 general election.

Described as being center-left, progressive, a left-wing populist, social democratic, and an economic nationalist, López Obrador has been a national politician for over three decades. During his presidency, he has promoted public investment in sectors that had been liberalized under previous administrations and has implemented several progressive social reforms. Supporters have praised him for promoting institutional renewal after decades of high inequality and corruption and refocusing the country&#x27;s neoliberal consensus towards improving the state of the working class. Critics have claimed that he and his administration stumbled in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to deal with drug cartels. He left office in September 2024, succeeded by Claudia Sheinbaum, and retired from both electoral politics and public life.

==Early life==
Andrés Manuel López Obrador was born in Tepetitán, a small village in the municipality of Macuspana, in the southern state of Tabasco, on 13 November 1953. He is the firstborn son of Andrés López Ramón (son of Lorenzo López and Beatriz Ramón) and Manuela Obrador González, Tabasco and Veracruz-based merchants. His younger siblings include José Ramón, José Ramiro, Pedro Arturo, Pío Lorenzo, and twins Candelaria Beatriz and Martín Jesús. His maternal grandfather José Obrador Revuelta was a Cantabrian who arrived as an exile in Mexico from Ampuero, Spain, while his maternal grandmother Úrsula González was the daughter of Asturians. Through his paternal grandparents, López Obrador is also of Indigenous and African descent.

López Obrador attended the only elementary school in town, the &quot;Marcos E. Becerra&quot; school, managed by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and named after the Mexican poet of the same name. During afternoons, he helped his parents at the &quot;La Posadita&quot; store. López Obrador began middle school in Macuspana but finished it in the state capital of Villahermosa, where his family moved in the mid-1960s and opened a clothes and shoe store called &quot;Novedades Andrés&quot;. On 8 June 1969, when he was 15 years old, his brother José Ramón López Obrador died from a gunshot to the head. According to &quot;Los Suspirantes 2018&quot;, José Ramón found a pistol, played with it, and it slipped out of his hands, firing a bullet into his head. The Tabasco newspapers &quot;Rumbo Nuevo&quot;, &quot;Diario de Tabasco&quot;, and &quot;Diario Presente&quot; presented a story where they were both playing around with the pistol and that Andrés Manuel fired it by accident. According to Zepeda Patterson, Andrés Manuel became &quot;taciturn, much more thoughtful&quot; following the incident. López Obrador finished high school and, at age 19, went to Mexico City to study at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

He studied political science and public administration at the UNAM from 1973 to 1976. He returned to school to complete his education after having held several positions within the government of Tabasco and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 1987, he received a degree in political science and public administration after the presentation of his thesis, &quot;Proceso de formación del Estado Nacional en México 1821-1867&quot; (Formation Process of the National State in Mexico 1821–1867).

He lived in the &quot;Casa del Estudiante Tabasco&quot; during his college years on Violeta Street in the Guerrero neighborhood of Mexico City. The institution was financed by the administration of Tabasco governor Mario Trujillo García through efforts of the poet Carlos Pellicer, with whom López Obrador began discussing. There was empathy between the two because the young man raised his concern for the Chontal Maya. After the meeting, the poet invited him to his senate campaign during the 1976 elections. His university professor, Enrique González Pedrero, was another figure that influenced López Obrador&#x27;s political trajectory.

After attending school from 1973 to 1976, he returned to his native Tabasco, where he held various government positions and was a professor at the Juárez Autonomous University of Tabasco.

== Personal life ==
During his early career, he met Rocío Beltrán Medina, a sociology student, who suggested López Obrador embrace the progressive wing of the PRI. They eventually married on 8 April 1978. They had three sons: José Ramón López Beltrán (born 1981), Andrés Manuel López Beltrán (born 1986), and Gonzalo Alfonso López Beltrán (born 1991). Beltrán Medina died on 12 January 2003 due to respiratory arrest caused by lupus, which she had suffered for several years. 

On 16 October 2006, he married Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller, who had worked in the Mexico City government during his tenure as Head of Government of Mexico City. Together they have one son, Jesús Ernesto López Gutiérrez (born 2007).

During his first presidential run, some news reports identified López Obrador as a Protestant; in a television interview, he self-identified as Catholic. In March 2018, he declared, &quot;When I am asked what religion I adhere to, I say that I am a Christian, in the broadest sense of the word, because Christ is love and justice is love.&quot;

López Obrador has held a variety of nicknames throughout his life, including &quot;El Molido&quot;, &quot;El Americano&quot; (The American), &quot;La Piedra&quot; (The Rock), &quot;El Comandante&quot; (The Commander), and the most popular among them is &quot;El Peje&quot;, named after the common Tabasco fish, the pejelagarto.

A baseball fan, his favorite sports team is the St. Louis Cardinals.

López Obrador was named one of Time magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People of 2019&quot;.

On 24 January 2021, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19.

==Early political career==
===Member of the PRI===

He joined the PRI in 1976 to support Carlos Pellicer&#x27;s campaign for a Senate seat for Tabasco. A year later, he headed the Indigenous People&#x27;s Institute of Tabasco. In 1984, he relocated to Mexico City to work at the National Consumers&#x27; Institute, a federal government agency.

===Member of the PRD===

López Obrador resigned from his position with the government of Tabasco in 1988 to join the new dissenting left wing of the PRI, then called the Democratic Current, led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas. This movement formed the National Democratic Front and later became the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).

In 1994, he ran for the governorship of Tabasco but lost to PRI candidate Roberto Madrazo. López Obrador gained national exposure as an advocate for the rights of indigenous people when, in 1996, he appeared on national TV drenched in blood following confrontations with police for blocking Pemex oil wells to defend the rights of local indigenous people impacted by pollution.

He was president of the PRD from 2 August 1996 to 10 April 1999.

==Head of Government of Mexico City (2000–2005)==
===Election===
On 2 July 2000, he was elected Head of Government of the Federal District, a position akin to that of city mayor for the national capital district, with 38.3% of the vote.

===Political agenda===

As mayor, López Obrador implemented various social programs that included extending financial assistance to help vulnerable groups in Mexico City, including single mothers, senior citizens, and the physically and mentally challenged. He invested in housing and schools, created old-age pensions, and expanded services. He also helped found the first new university in Mexico City in three decades, the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México.

López Obrador hired former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to craft a zero-tolerance policy that would help reduce crime in Mexico City.

He directed the restoration and modernization of Mexico City&#x27;s historic downtown, which has 16th- and 17th-century buildings and many tourist spaces. He led a joint venture with billionaire businessman Carlos Slim Helú, a native of downtown Mexico City, to expropriate, restore, rebuild, and gentrify large parts of the area, creating shopping and residential areas for middle- and upper-income residents.

López Obrador used fiscal policy to encourage private sector investment in housing. He granted construction firms tax breaks and liberalized zoning regulations, leading to the construction of more condominiums and office buildings during his tenure than during any other period in Mexico City&#x27;s history. New high-density condos emerged in the upscale neighborhoods of Polanco and Lomas de Chapultepec.

To improve traffic flow on the city&#x27;s two main inner-city roads, Periférico and Viaducto, he added sections of second stories to the Anillo Periférico. He renovated about 10% of those roads. The Metrobús, an express bus service based on the Curitiba model, was built down Avenida Insurgentes, cutting through the city some 20 km from north to south.

===Response to Tláhuac lynching===

López Obrador&#x27;s popularity diminished after the lynching of two federal law-enforcement officers performing an undercover investigation in Tláhuac in November 2004. The Mexico City Police rescued one agent, but the city&#x27;s chief of police, Marcelo Ebrard, and federal Secretary of Public Safety, Ramón Martín Huerta, were both accused of not organizing a timely rescue effort. López Obrador&#x27;s secretary of government, Alejandro Encinas, was criticized for declaring that the lynching should be understood as stemming from indigenous customary law (&quot;usos y costumbres&quot;). After a thorough investigation, López Obrador gave Ebrard a vote of confidence, despite a request from President Vicente Fox Quesada for him to be relieved of duty. Later, using his constitutional powers, Fox fired Ebrard. At the same time, Martín Huerta, a member of Fox&#x27;s cabinet, received a reprimand and continued to hold office as Secretary of Public Safety until he died in a helicopter accident. López Obrador later appointed Ebrard as Secretary of Social Development and supported his candidacy in the PRD primaries to run for office as Head of Government of the Federal District in 2006.

===Removal of his immunity from prosecution===
Elected government officials in Mexico have an official immunity called &quot;fuero&quot; that prevents criminal charges from being brought against them, which can be removed through &quot;desafuero&quot;. In 2004, the Attorney General&#x27;s Office asked Congress to strip López Obrador of his immunity under charges of a misdemeanor (ignoring a court order). The misdemeanor against López Obrador was his refusal to order the cessation of the construction of a private hospital on land expropriated by Rosario Robles (who preceded López Obrador as Head of Government of the Federal District under the Ernesto Zedillo government). Under federal law, any person with criminal charges during the electoral process would not be eligible to run in a presidential election. A legal process begun in 2004 would likely have continued during the presidential campaigns of 2006, ending López Obrador&#x27;s presidential run.

Although his political opponents argued he should be subject to the same judicial process as anyone else, newspaper editorials throughout the world charged that the &quot;desafuero&quot; was politically motivated (including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;), that it undermined Mexican democracy, and that López Obrador&#x27;s exclusion from the upcoming elections would delegitimize the eventual winner.

After Congress voted to remove López Obrador&#x27;s immunity, he asked for leave from his post for a few days. President Vicente Fox, wanting to avoid a political crisis and knowing that the decision made by Congress was widely unpopular, appeared on national television in April 2005, stating that the issue would not be pursued further. The controversy closed on a technicality, and López Obrador, despite the removal of immunity, was not prosecuted and thus remained eligible to participate in the 2006 presidential election. Weeks later, Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha resigned.

===Public opinion at the end of his term===
As Head of Government of the Federal District, López Obrador became one of the country&#x27;s most recognizable politicians. He left office with an 84% approval rating, according to an opinion poll by Consulta Mitofsky. According to an article by &quot;Reforma&quot; newspaper, he kept 80% of the promises he made as a candidate.

==Presidential campaigns==
===2006 presidential election===
In September 2005, the PRD nominated López Obrador as presidential pre-candidate for the 2006 general election. Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas declined to participate in the internal elections when polls showed López Obrador as the clear favorite.

Until March 2006, polls showed him as the presidential frontrunner; however, his numbers had declined by late April. An article published by &quot;La Crónica de Hoy&quot; in March 2006 said that Mexican Bolivarian Circles and students, allegedly assisted by Venezuelan agents, distributed &quot;Bolivarian propaganda in favor of Andrés Manuel López Obrador&quot; throughout cities in Mexico and that such groups were given &quot;economic support, logistics advice and ideological instruction&quot; from the Hugo Chávez government.

Some left-wing politicians and analysts criticized López Obrador for including in his close staff many former members of the PRI who fought against his party in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Arturo Núñez (one of the authors of &quot;Fobaproa&quot; contingency fund), Manuel Camacho Solís and Marcelo Ebrard. The guerrilla leader of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), Subcomandante Marcos, said López Obrador was a false left-wing candidate, arguing that he was a centrist candidate. Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas did not participate in campaign events but stated that he would still vote for his party, the PRD.

López Obrador&#x27;s proposals, including his &quot;50 commitments&quot;, produced mixed opinions from analysts. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that López Obrador used U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt as inspiration for his proposals.

On 19 May, Roberto Madrazo, the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidate, hinted at the possibility of an alliance with López Obrador to prevent National Action Party (PAN) candidate Felipe Calderón from winning the election after both parties criticized president Vicente Fox for what they saw as illegal support by the federal government for Calderón. A PRD spokesperson said both parties entered an information-sharing agreement regarding the issue. This, combined with calls from high-ranking PRI member Manuel Bartlett (former Secretary of the Interior during the 1988 presidential election fraud) to vote for López Obrador, aroused media speculation that the PRI and the PRD would ally.

On 28 May, after López Obrador discounted any such alliance because the PRI and PRD political tendencies could not be reconciled, Roberto Madrazo indicated that his comments were misunderstood and that he would not step down or endorse any other candidate.

In 2006, the Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; criticized López Obrador for what it characterized as &quot;extreme&quot; verbal insults toward Mexican government institutions and President Vicente Fox.

====Election results====
On 6 July 2006, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) announced the final vote count in the 2006 presidential election, resulting in a narrow margin of 0.56 percentage points (243,934 votes) of victory for his opponent, Felipe Calderón. López Obrador appealed the results, claiming widespread irregularities, and demanded an election recount. (A generalized recount is only to be carried in extreme circumstances, according to Mexican Electoral Tribunal Jurisprudence S3ELJ14-2004.) On 8 July 2006, López Obrador called for nationwide protests to ask for a national recount, stating &quot;the government would be responsible for any flare-up of anger after officials rejected his demand for a manual recount of Sunday&#x27;s extremely close vote.&quot; However, on 5 September 2006, the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF) ruled that the election was fair and that Calderón was the winner and would become president.

In contesting the election, López Obrador and his coalition made several arguments: (a) that President Fox, the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial (CCE), a business interest group, and other organizations had illegally interfered in the presidential campaign, which is strictly prohibited by electoral law, thereby providing grounds for election annulment; that (b) that votes were fraudulently tallied on 2 July and afterward; and that (c) there was widespread and significant evidence of electoral irregularities, ranging from stuffed ballot boxes and inconsistent tally reports to improper and illegal handling of the ballot trail and voter intimidation.

The Court did find that President Fox and the CCE had interfered in the elections by campaigning for Felipe Calderón, which is against electoral laws. The Court ruled that both interferences could not be considered a sufficient judicial cause to annul the election. In response to fraud allegations, the Court stated there was insufficient evidence to annul the election.

López Obrador and his coalition had alleged irregularities in many polling stations and requested a national recount. Ultimately, the TEPJF, in a unanimous vote, ordered a recount of about 9% of the polling stations. The Supreme Court later ruled that the evidence presented did not demonstrate the occurrence of sufficient irregularities to change the election outcome.

In response to this result, in a move reminiscent of Francisco I. Madero declaring himself provisional President of Mexico after calling the 1910 elections against Porfirio Díaz fraudulent, López Obrador&#x27;s followers proclaimed him the &quot;Presidente Legitimo&quot; (Legitimate President), inaugurated him in a ceremony in the Zócalo and called for the creation of an alternative, parallel government.

====Post-election protests====

López Obrador announced his victory to his supporters on the night of the election, stating that exit polls declared he had won by 500,000 votes. He did not cite any polls at the time and later referenced Covarrubias and IMO. Several days later, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) published its final tally, which had him down by a margin of 0.58%, or approximately 243,000 votes. López Obrador then initiated legal actions, claiming election irregularities in 54% of polling stations, and demanded a &quot;vote by vote&quot; recount in all polling stations.

The Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF) discussed the case and eventually dismissed it. The IFE called for the candidates to refrain from proclaiming themselves as the winner, president-elect, or president until the final resolution. Both candidates disobeyed this call. In an interview with U.S. Spanish-language TV network Univision, López Obrador referred to himself as &quot;President of Mexico&quot;.

López Obrador held several gatherings in downtown Mexico City, with hundreds of thousands attending. On 31 July, as an act of civil disobedience, he organized a blockade of 12 kilometers of Paseo de la Reforma, one of the city&#x27;s most important roads, which houses several hotels, corporate headquarters, and the Mexico City Stock Market. Business groups said the blockades cost Mexico City businesses in the area millions of pesos in losses.

On 5 August, the TEPJF met in a public session to decide the outcome of the complaints the PRD and its coalition partners had filed. The seven magistrates voted unanimously to order a recount of 11,839 ballot boxes in 155 districts (9.2% of the total) despite López Obrador&#x27;s public demand for a total recount. The TEPJF based its decision for a partial recount on its finding that, despite publicly demanding a vote-by-vote general recount, López Obrador&#x27;s party filed legal challenges for 71,000 polling stations (54%). Therefore, by law, the TEPJF found it could order a recount of only those 71,000 polling stations contested. The TEPJF ruled it could not order a recount of the votes not in controversy because &quot;the certainty asked by the [López Obrador] Coalition is tied to the respect for the tallies certified by the citizens in the polling stations, not in controversy.&quot;

The TEPJF did certify that principles of certainty were grounds for a recount in some stations since there was evidence of possible irregularities. López Obrador rejected the resolution as too narrow, and he and his followers intensified their civil resistance. For about two hours on 9 August, protesters took over the tollbooths on four federal highways linking Mexico City to Cuernavaca, Querétaro, Toluca, and Pachuca. The protesters prevented personnel from charging tolls on some roads and allowed vehicles to pass freely. Also, hundreds of López Obrador supporters surrounded four of the main offices of foreign banks, including Citibank, Banamex, BBVA, and the Mexican subsidiary of HSBC, closing them for about four hours, claiming that foreign banks &quot;ransack the country&quot; and &quot;widen the barrier between rich and poor&quot; alleging banks had become involved in Mexican politics by supporting Calderón.

On 8 August, López Obrador sent a message to the press regarding the blockades, where he explained his reasons for continuing the &quot;peaceful civil resistance&quot;. López Obrador held a rally called &quot;National Democratic Convention&quot; on 16 September, Independence Day, when a military parade was scheduled. The convention started after the military parade. Claiming he country&#x27;s institutions to be colluded, López Obrador said that they &quot;no longer work&quot; and called for creating new ones.

López Obrador led a rally on the day of the State of the Union speech, where sympathizers prevented President Vicente Fox from delivering a speech inside the Legislative Palace of San Lázaro. They claimed that the President &quot;had created a police state&quot; in the area around Congress. They interpreted it as an unconstitutional act that made it impossible for Congress to be called into session. López Obrador told his followers not to be lured into violent confrontations with the police, declaring, &quot;We aren&#x27;t going to fall into any trap. We aren&#x27;t going to be provoked.&quot; He urged his followers to remain in the Zócalo instead of marching to the Legislative Palace.

According to a poll published on 1 December 2006 in &quot; El Universal&quot;&quot;,&quot; 42% thought that Calderón&#x27;s victory was fraudulent, and 46% thought it was not.

====&quot;Legitimate presidency&quot;====
On 20 November 2006, during the federal holiday commemorating the Mexican Revolution, López Obrador&#x27;s sympathizers proclaimed him the &quot;Legitimate President&quot; at a rally in the Zócalo in Mexico City. The action was planned in another rally, the &quot;National Democratic Convention&quot;, in which supporters gave him the title. López Obrador called for the establishment of a parallel government and shadow cabinet at the convention.

After supporters proclaimed him as the &quot;Legitimate President of Mexico&quot;, López Obrador created a &quot;Cabinet of Denunciation&quot; to protest actions made by President Felipe Calderón. In his speech at the proclamation ceremony, López Obrador promised to &quot;procure the happiness of the people&quot; and announced twenty &quot;actions of government&quot;, such as fostering a process for renewal of public institutions and defending the right to information and demanding openness of communication media.

Days later, López Obrador announced that he would earn a salary of 50,000 pesos (US$2,500) a month, provided by donations.

=====Reactions=====
Reactions to the &quot;legitimate presidency&quot; varied widely. An opinion by &quot;El País&quot; said that López Obrador&#x27;s &quot;lack of consideration for democratic institutions and the rule of law seriously endanger civil peace in Mexico.&quot; After speculation on whether or not López Obrador&#x27;s self-proclamation was against the law, the PRI stated that this political action was not a crime. Liébano Sáenz, chief of staff of former President Ernesto Zedillo, said López Obrador &quot;will become the conscience of the nation, which will do much good for Mexican democracy.&quot; José Raúl Vera López, the Roman Catholic bishop of Saltillo, Coahuila, declared that the so-called &quot;legitimate presidency&quot; was a result of the &quot;profound discontent with how the country has been run&quot; and that López Obrador had &quot;very deep moral backing&quot;.

A poll by Grupo Reforma indicated that 56% of Mexicans disapproved of López Obrador taking the title, while only 19% approved. Sixty-three percent of those polled said the former candidate had lost credibility. Other responses in the poll included 82% describing the political atmosphere in Mexico as &quot;tense&quot;, 45% of those polled blamed it on the PRD, 20% blamed it on the PAN, and 25% blamed both parties. The poll was a telephone survey of 850 adults on 18 November with 95% confidence interval of +/-3.4% margin of error.

In the first few months of his term, President Calderón announced initiatives that mirrored López Obrador&#x27;s initiatives. These included price ceilings for tortillas through the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact, that protected small corn producers, reductions to the president and cabinet minister salaries, and the proposal for a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would have lowered wages for public servants and impose caps on their remuneration. Some interpreted this measures as &quot;seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to incorporate the agenda of election rival Andrés Manuel López Obrador into his government.&quot; Others saw them as intending to undercut the opposition government.

=====Occupation of Congress=====

Congress was also taken by legislators of the Broad Progressive Front (FAP), the PRD, Labor, and Convergence parties on 10 April 2008 because they disagreed with the Government regarding energy policy discussions, claiming they were unconstitutional. López Obrador&#x27;s followers, using chairs and tables and barricades, took both chambers of Congress and had them chained, thus avoiding the passage of secondary laws which modified the legal framework of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Pemex. López Obrador and his followers opposed these laws and viewed them as leading to the &quot;de facto&quot; privatization of the company. López Obrador requested a four-month debate on energy policies instead of the 50-day one presented by the PAN, PRI, Green Party and New Alliance.

===2012 presidential election===

López Obrador ran again as the PRD, Labor Party, and Citizens&#x27; Movement candidate under the coalition &quot;Movimiento Progresista&quot; in the 2012 presidential election.

====Political proposals====
=====Economic proposals=====
In November 2011, López Obrador announced some of his economic proposals:
* Job creation: A sustained 6% growth rate to generate the new 1.2 million jobs needed each year.
* Austerity: Reducing salaries of government officials and unnecessary spending, saving around US$30 billion a year.
* Progressive fiscal reforms: López Obrador said the people who make less should pay a smaller percentage of taxes than those who make more money.
* No new taxes or increases on existing taxes: López Obrador plans to focus on ending fiscal privileges.
* Competition: End monopolies; any private citizen who wants to participate in media, television, and telephony should be able to.

=====Security policy=====

López Obrador had been a firm critic of Felipe Calderón&#x27;s crime strategy and promised to reduce military presence on the streets, offering reparations to victims of the Mexican Drug War and emphasizing the protection of human rights in the country. López Obrador proposed a single police command that would gradually assume the activities of the Mexican Navy and the Mexican Army, as well as a single intelligence agency to tackle the financial networks of criminal organizations. The new police force would promote &quot;civic and moral values&quot;. He promised to increase the salaries and benefits given to law enforcement officials throughout Mexico. His security strategy comprised ten proposals, but all of them had the main theme: organized crime cannot be tackled if the government is responsible for the erosion of human rights.

He also stated that if elected, he would reject any intelligence activity from the United States, including money and weapons in aid. This policy would stop the operations in Mexico of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration, including the use of drones. But it could also discourage U.S. aid to Mexico (US$1.6 billion since 2008). The proposal intended to appeal to discontent over U.S. actions in &quot;Operation Fast and Furious&quot;, where ATF agents were involved in a gun-walking scandal.

López Obrador promised to reactivate the economy and social growth, so more people could have access to a &quot;better life&quot; without joining cartels and abandoning the rule of law. He also pledged to improve the education system and create more jobs before the criminal groups can recruit them. He also spoke of taming corruption, impunity, drug consumption, addiction, and elite privileges. The security Cabinet he proposed would work directly with the municipal and state forces in a unified command.

López Obrador summed up his security policy as &quot;Abrazos, no balazos&quot; (Hugs, not bullets). At the start of his campaign, he said he would remove Mexican Army personnel from the streets. Still, in May 2012, it stated that the military would continue to operate until Mexico had a &quot;trained, skilled and moralized police force.&quot;

====Proposed cabinet====
López Obrador announced a tentative cabinet. Among them were:
* Marcelo Ebrard as Secretary of the Interior
* Rogelio Ramírez de la O as Secretary of the Treasury
* Juan Ramón de la Fuente as Secretary of Education
* Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo as Secretary of the Environment
* Javier Jiménez Espriú as Secretary of Communications and Transportation
* Fernando Turner as Secretary of Economic Development
* Adolfo Hellmund López as Secretary of Energy
* René Drucker Colín as Secretary of Science and Technology
* Elena Poniatowska as Secretary of Culture
* Héctor Vasconcelos as Secretary of Foreign Affairs

==== Election results ====

The election was won by Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, with 38.2%, to 31.6% for López Obrador. López Obrador did not accept the preliminary results, as most votes had not been counted. Subsequently, he claimed vote buying and other irregularities and demanded a full recount by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). The IFE found irregularities but confirmed the results on 6 July. López Obrador rejected this announcement and filed a complaint to invalidate the election. He alleged vote-buying, spending above election regulations, illegal fundraising, and vote fraud. On 30 August, the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary formally rejected his complaint.

====Peña Nieto vote-buying controversy====
At a news conference, López Obrador claimed that the election was &quot;plagued with irregularities&quot; and accused the PRI of vote buying. He also claimed that the PRI handed out gifts to lure voters into casting their vote for that party with the cooperation of Soriana, a retail chain. On the day of the 2012 presidential elections, people who voted for the PRI would receive pre-paid gift cards. Nonetheless, the PRI and the store denied those accusations and threatened to sue López Obrador. Peña Nieto vowed to imprison anyone – including members of the PRI – if they were found guilty of electoral fraud. Despite Peña Nieto&#x27;s statement, videos by citizens about the Soriana cards surfaced on the internet.

===Creation of Morena (2012–2014)===

Following the 2012 presidential election loss, López Obrador told a rally in Mexico City&#x27;s Zócalo on 9 September 2012 that he would withdraw from the Democratic Revolution Party &quot;on the best of terms&quot;. He said he was working on founding a new party from the National Regeneration Movement (&quot;Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional&quot; in Spanish), or Morena, for its acronym in Spanish. A couple of days after his departure from the PRD, federal deputy Ricardo Monreal stated it was a &quot;divorce for convenience&quot;, and that López Obrador did the most responsible thing to avoid polarization of the country. According to polls and surveys, in 2012 most of the Mexican public had a negative view of the establishment of Morena as a political party. On 7 January 2014, Martí Batres, president of Morena, presented the documentation to the INE to be acknowledged political party.

In 2014, López Obrador revealed why he left the PRD, stating, &quot;I left the PRD because the leaders of that party betrayed the people, they went with Peña Nieto and approved the Pact for Mexico, which is nothing more than a Pact against Mexico. I can not be in a party where tax increases were approved, and it was approved that they would increase the price of gasoline every month. Gasoline in Mexico costs more than in the United States, the salary in Mexico is the lowest in the entire North American continent, and instead of asking for wage increases, the PRD rose to the podium to ask for an increase in the price of gasoline, it&#x27;s an embarrassment.&quot; After Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas criticized him for forming his political party, on 7 July 2014, López Obrador posted on social media that, &quot;PRD leaders and most of its legislators voted for the fiscal reforms [raising taxes and gas prices] and with their collaboration they paved the way for privatization of the oil industry.&quot; On 10 July 2014, the INE approved Morena as an official political party to receive federal funds and participate in the 2015 legislative elections.

===2018 presidential election===
López Obrador participated again in the 2018 presidential election, his third presidential run. In the election, he represented Morena, the left-wing Labor Party (PT), and the socially conservative right-wing Social Encounter Party (PES) under the coalition &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot;. Pre-election polls indicated he had a double-digit lead over candidates Ricardo Anaya, José Antonio Meade, and Jaime Rodríguez Calderón.

In 2018, the Mexican publication &quot;Aristegui Noticias&quot; criticized Vicente Fox for what it characterized as &quot;extreme&quot; verbal insults on Twitter towards López Obrador&#x27;s crackdown on institutional corruption.

====Juntos Haremos Historia====
=====Background=====

On 24 June 2017, the PT agreed to fight the 2018 election in an electoral alliance with Morena; however, the coalition had not officially registered with the National Electoral Institute (INE), the country&#x27;s electoral authority. For Morena, the alliance consolidated after the withdrawal of the PT&#x27;s candidate Óscar González Yáñez, who resigned his candidacy and called for votes in favor of Delfina Gómez Álvarez, the standard-bearer in the state elections of the State of Mexico in 2017.

In October 2017, at PT&#x27;s National Congress, as party president Alberto Anaya was reelected to another 6-year term, PT formalized its coalition with Morena.

At first, there was speculation about the possibility of a front grouping all the left-wing parties: Morena, the PRD, PT, and the MC. However, López Obrador rejected any agreement due to political differences, especially after the 2017 State of Mexico elections, where the candidates of the PRD and MC continued with their campaigns and refused to support the Morena candidate. At the end of November 2017, the leaders of Morena and the PES announced that they were in talks to form a possible alliance: Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, president of the PES, said: &quot;We don&#x27;t negotiate with the PRI, we have two options, go alone or with Morena.&quot;

=====Confirmation=====

On 13 December 2017, PES joined the coalition between Morena and the PT, and it was formalized under the name &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; (Together We Will Make History). Following the signing of the agreement, López Obrador was appointed as a pre-candidate for the three political groups. It was a partial coalition that supported López Obrador as the presidential candidate and divided the legislative elections between the three: Morena chose candidates in 150 federal electoral districts (out of 300) and 32 Senate rates, while the PT and the PES each nominated 75 candidates for the Chamber of Deputies and 16 for the Senate.

The alliance received criticism as it was a coalition between two left-wing parties (Mrena and the PT) with a formation related to the evangelical right (PES). In response, Morena national president Yeidckol Polevnsky said that her party &quot;believes in inclusion and teamwork to rescue Mexico&quot; and that they will continue to defend human rights; in turn, Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, national president of the PES, said that &quot;the only possibility of real change in our country is the one headed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador&quot; and that his party had decided to be &quot;on the right side of history&quot;.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador said this would be his last attempt to become president, rejecting the idea of becoming a permanent moral leader for the Mexican left-wing.

====International solidarity====
In Paris, France, there is the &quot;Official French Committee of Morena&quot;, on which several occasions have presented their support to the candidate in small rallies in that European country. In February 2018, French deputy and former presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, founder of the La France Insoumise party, met with López Obrador, before the official start of the electoral campaign in Mexico, and described his possible victory in the following terms: &quot;If they manage to thwart the plans against them and win the elections, it will be a great change for Mexico and all of Latin America.&quot;

Miguel Ángel Revilla, president of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria, Spain, mentioned López Obrador in an interview on the &quot;El Hormiguero&quot; program, where he spoke of the possibility of victory for the presidential candidate in 2018: &quot;I think he&#x27;s going to win because Mexico needs a change to a good person because they are presenting him as a Chávez-type populist, or Fidel Castro-type, but really, because he wants to end corruption and inequality within [the limits of] what he can do because the country does not deserve what it has until now; I want to send my support to this man, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, from here.&quot;

López Obrador has been referred to as the &quot;ideological twin&quot; of the US&#x27;s progressive leader Bernie Sanders and the UK&#x27;s Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the latter having visited López Obrador and invited him over to the British Parliament.

====Proposed Cabinet====
In December 2017, López Obrador presented his proposed cabinet:
* Olga Sánchez Cordero as Secretary of the Interior
* Héctor Vasconcelos as Secretary of Foreign Affairs
* Carlos Manuel Urzúa Macías as Secretary of Finance
* Maria Luisa Albores as Secretary of Social Development
* Josefa González Blanco Ortiz Mena as Secretary of Environment
* Rocío Nahle García as Secretary of Energy
* Graciela Márquez Colín as Secretary of Economy
* Esteban Moctezuma Barragán as Secretary of Education
* Víctor Villalobos as Secretary of Agriculture
* Javier Jiménez Espriú as Secretary of Communications
* Irma Eréndira Sandoval as Secretary of the Civil Service
* Jorge Alcocer Varela as Secretary of Health
* Luisa María Alcalde Luján as Secretary of Labor
* Román Meyer Falcón as Secretary of Agrarian Development and Urban Planning
* Miguel Torruco Marqués as Secretary of Tourism
* Alejandra Frausto Guerrero as Secretary of Culture

Replacements
* It was announced on 5 July 2018 that Héctor Vasconcelos would be replaced at Foreign Affairs by Marcelo Ebrard, following Vasconcelos&#x27;s election to the Senate.
* Arturo Herrera replaced Carlos Manuel Urzúa Macías at Finance on 10 July 2019.
* Víctor Manuel Toledo replaced Josefa González Blanco Ortíz Mena as Minister of Environment and Natural Resources on 25 May 2019.

====Political positions during campaign====

López Obrador has been described as left-wing and populist. Other outlets have claimed that López Obrador toned down his rhetoric for the 2018 election, allying with business figures and narrowing his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In his inauguration speech, he inveighed against neoliberalism, calling it a &quot;disaster&quot; and a &quot;calamity&quot; for the country, and promised &quot;a fourth transformation&quot;, in reference to three major events in Mexican history, the Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821), the Reform War (1858–1861) and the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920).

He proposed the cancellation of the under-construction New Mexico City International Airport, the conversion of the president&#x27;s official residence and office complex, Los Pinos, into a cultural center, as well as universal health care, free internet, and a sale of the presidential aircraft. López Obrador has offered to hold referendums on various issues, among them a performance evaluation halfway through his term during the 2021 legislative elections (instead of his former proposal of every two years)) that would cut his six-year term short if he lost the consultation. He proposed dispersing the cabinet throughout the country&#x27;s states, with the objective of &quot;promoting development throughout the national territory,&quot; while the Presidency and the Ministries of National Defense, the Navy, the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance and Public Credit would remain in the capital.

New Airport for Mexico City

Corruption, geological, and environmental problems related to the construction of a new airport in Texcoco, State of Mexico, were major issues during López Obrador&#x27;s 2018 presidential campaign. After winning the election but before taking office, he sponsored a citizen referendum on replacing the Texcoco airport with rebuilding the military airport Santa Lucia in Zumpango, State of Mexico. The referendum passed with 70% of the 1 million votes cast. Canceling the airport cost MXN 75 billion (US$3.98 billion). The new airport in Zumpango was named &quot;Felipe Ángeles International Airport&quot;, and construction began on 17 October 2019. The airport opened in March 2022.

=====Anti-corruption=====
López Obrador&#x27;s chief pledge was to eradicate institutional corruption by enacting constitutional laws and policies to make corruption more difficult. One example is two laws enacted that make corruption and voter fraud a criminal act without bail, as well as removing corrupt government officials with due process. López Obrador pledged a combination of zero tolerance and personal honesty to sweep it out &quot;from top to bottom like cleaning the stairs.&quot; He asked international organizations to come to Mexico to help investigate cases of corruption and human rights abuses. He announced a willingness to allow the creation of a body akin to the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala to help local prosecutors build graft cases. He also proposed to amend an article in the constitution to make it possible to try presidents for corruption.

=====Energy=====
López Obrador has had mixed views on the privatization of oil that was signed into law in 2013. He has called for a referendum over the that ended Pemex&#x27;s monopoly in the oil industry. Rocío Nahle García, his top energy adviser, has called for a freeze on future deepwater drilling auctions and a review of contracts with international oil companies. In February 2018, his business adviser, Alfonso Romo, said, &quot;[he] reviewed most of the oil tenders awarded to private drillers and found them to be beneficial for Mexico.&quot; He has also pledged to end oil exports to focus internally, as well as invest in refineries along with ending the importation of gasoline from the United States, saying the nation must recover energy self-sufficiency &quot;as a principle of national security&quot; and should make loss-making state refineries operable and assess biodiesel production. López Obrador has promised no more &quot;gasolinazos&quot; as well as no more hikes in electricity and gas prices. On 30 November 2018, López Obrador told the press that the previous administration&#x27;s oil reforms, which permitted auctioning oil field rights to private companies, would not continue under his administration.

Shortly after taking office, López Obrador cracked down on the robbery of motor fuels: Huachicolero. Despite the 18 January 2019 Tlahuelilpan pipeline explosion that cost the lives of at least 119 in Tlahuelilpan, Hidalgo, and local fuel shortages, gasoline theft was cut by 95% from 81,000 barrels in November 2018 to 4,000 barrels in April 2019 with a savings of 11 billion pesos ($581 million).

By 2023 Mexico plans to have seven oil refineries, including a new one that is being built at the Dos Bocas port in Paraíso, Tabasco. Construction on the Dos Bocas refinery began in August 2019, with an estimated cost between US$6 billion and $8 billion.

=====Education=====
With his saying, &quot;&quot; (Scholarship recipients, yes; hitmen, no), López Obrador promised guaranteed schooling and employment to all young Mexicans, through universal access to public colleges, and proposed monthly scholarships of 2,400 MXN to low-income university students. López Obrador is against the educational reform passed into law in 2013, stating he opposes the use of standardized test scores as a basis for firing teachers, saying, &quot;It is an ideological problem of the right, of conservatism; deep down they do not want public education, they want education to be privatized, that is the mentality that prevails in these people. I ask them to be serene and if you really want to help improve education, do not polarize or disqualify [the teachers].&quot; He also argued that: &quot;children go to school without eating and that is not addressed in the so-called education reform.&quot;

The educational reform laws passed during the Peña Nieto administration were overturned in September 2019. The new laws promise to assess teachers&#x27; opinions and preserve the public nature of the school system.

=====Drug War=====

As the Mexican Drug War that started under President Calderón (2006–12) dragged on into its 12th year, he reiterated his 2012 presidential run strategy of &quot;Abrazos, no balazos&quot; (Hugs, not bullets), arguing that jobs and better wages, especially for younger people and the rural populace, are necessary to combat crime, not the use of more military force. He has proposed amnesty for some drug war criminals, for which he would seek the aid of international NGOs, Pope Francis, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Héctor Vasconcelos, a former diplomat, said a López Obrador government would gradually pull back the Army and Navy from the streets where they have been engaged. López Obrador is willing to establish a truth commission to bring closure to tens of thousands of people exposed to murders and disappearances of their friends and families, such as the 2014 Ayotzinapa kidnapping. He declared that he would consider legalizing certain drugs as part of a broader strategy to fight poverty and crime.

López Obrador declared an end to the Drug War, announcing that he wished to shift from capturing &quot;capos&quot; (drug lords) to reducing violence and paying more attention to health and socioeconomic concerns. Nonetheless, the murder rate increased during his first year in office. López Obrador has sent the newly formed, militarized National Guard to fight crime, but they have not been any more successful than previous police and military efforts. A major setback was a failed attempt to arrest Ovidio Guzmán López in October 2019, which set off fierce gun battles in Culiacán, Sinaloa, and had to be called off. López Obrador later explained that his primary concern was saving lives. When three adults and six children, American citizens belonging to the LeBaron family, were killed near the border between Sinaloa and Chihuahua, President Donald Trump briefly threatened to declare the cartels terrorist organizations. López Obrador persuaded him not to do so.

=====Economic policy=====
Lopez Obrador describes himself as an adherent of a mixed economy. At an event on 3 June 2018, he explained that &quot;there will be a mixed economy; the State with public investment could not face the challenge of growth in Mexico, private investment is required, and the social sector is also required.&quot; Based on his economic proposals, he wants the country to be &quot;self-sufficient&quot; and to &quot;rescue the agriculture industry&quot; affected by the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has also doubled compensations to both, pensions to two million five hundred senior citizens, and the nation&#x27;s minimum wage. López Obrador has also created a special zone along Mexico&#x27;s northern border with lower value-added taxes, lower rent taxes, and a higher minimum wage. His advisers also said that the same measures could also be directed at Mexico&#x27;s southern border and elsewhere to contain migration. He has planned a host of infrastructure projects in partnership with the private sector, including rail links in the forests of Yucatán and across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, to spark economic growth in Mexico&#x27;s economically depressed south. At a major banking conference in March 2018, he made promises to maintain economic stability and respect the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico, saying: &quot;We will support banks and we won&#x27;t confiscate assets. There won&#x27;t be expropriations or nationalizations.&quot;

=====NAFTA/USMCA=====
López Obrador has criticized NAFTA, arguing small Mexican corn farmers have been affected, as well as proposing to defend avocado farmers from agricultural tariffs. He has asked Peña Nieto&#x27;s administration to postpone the current renegotiation of the agreement, arguing both Donald Trump and Peña Nieto do not have a strong, amicable relationship, tainted by a cancelled foreign trip. During the general assembly of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, he said he does not want the agreement cancelled, arguing it benefits the three member nations. In June 2018, during a presidential debate, he argued that if there is a failure in the NAFTA renegotiation, the domestic economy must be strengthened, saying, &quot;[it] cannot be fatal for Mexicans, our country has a lot of natural resources, a lot of wealth.&quot; López Obrador has argued in favor of increasing workers&#x27; salaries &quot;because wages in our country are very low; they are the lowest wages in the world and we need to strengthen the domestic market and improve the income of workers; you can not be paying the workers of the maquilas 800 pesos a week.&quot;

Mexico and the United States reached a new trade agreement on 27 August 2018, and Canada agreed on 30 September. The new trade agreement is called the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA increases environmental and labor regulations, and incentivizes the domestic production of cars and trucks. The agreement also provides updated intellectual property protections. Then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, and Deputy Minister for North America Jesús Seade Kuri signed a modified agreement in Mexico City on 10 December 2018. The Mexican Senate ratified the treaty on 19 June 2019, the US on January 29, 2020 (Public Law No: 116–113), and Canada on March 13, 2020.

=====Fiscal policy=====
Arguing he would be fiscally conservative, López Obrador proposed raising social spending without tax hikes or accumulation of public debt, via proposed austerity measures on politician and bureaucrat salaries and subsidies, including the president&#x27;s salary and post-presidential pension, as well as fighting private corruption and tax fraud.

López Obrador has reduced the presidential salary by 60% to MXN 108,000 (US$5,000) per month and has limited what public servants and judiciary members can earn. He opened the presidential housing complex of Los Pinos to the public, taking up residence in the National Palace. On top of this, he has sold off government assets, including vehicles and real estate; proceeds have gone to social programs for the poor. An austerity law passed in October 2019 restricts remodeling of government offices, bans government employees for ten years from working in private companies they regulated while in office, and cuts presidential pensions. The president flies commercial airlines, but has not yet found a buyer for the presidential airplane.

=====Foreign policy=====
Following accusations by interest groups and the opposition, which have alleged influences by the Venezuelan government and drawn comparisons with Donald Trump, López Obrador stated, &quot;No to &quot;Chavismo&quot;, no to &quot;Trumpismo&quot;; yes to &quot;Juarismo&quot;, yes to &quot;Maderismo&quot;, yes to &quot;Cardenismo&quot;, yes to &quot;Mexicanismo&quot;.&quot; He has repeatedly stated that he wants to continue the bilateral relationship with the United States based on mutual respect and friendship, &quot;and not of subordination&quot;, insisting that &quot;Mexico will not be a piñata of any foreign government&quot;. He has also said, &quot;we no longer want Mexico to be seen as a country of conquest, the looting is over.&quot; During a presidential debate, López Obrador argued that &quot;the best foreign policy is domestic policy&quot;, in that if the country has no corruption and crime, it will help develop trust for investment and tourism because the image of Mexico would improve the perception of Mexico in the international arena. He has campaigned on Mexico&#x27;s former foreign policy of non-interventionism and the Principle of the self-determination of the peoples&#x27; nations, the Estrada Doctrine, stated in the Mexican constitution, article 89. López Obrador reiterated his commitment to non-interventionism with the statement he made during his presidential victory speech, &quot;We will be friends of all the world&#x27;s people and governments. The principles of non-intervention, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of disputes will be applied again.&quot;

After the 2019 election victory in Argentina, López Obrador developed a close relationship with President Alberto Fernández in what &quot;El País&quot; described as a &quot;progressive alliance&quot;, with Fernández making one of his first official trips abroad to Mexico (the first being to Israel). The two countries later developed a closer bond in cooperation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. López Obrador also expressed support for Argentina&#x27;s claim to the Falkland Islands and has urged the United Kingdom to negotiate an end to the dispute with Argentina.

=====Immigration and U.S. policy=====

As President Donald Trump accused Mexican illegal immigrants of &quot;bringing drugs [and] crime&quot; during his presidential campaign, López Obrador took a stance against Trump&#x27;s proposals for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border as well as the deportation of undocumented immigrants in the United States. In 2017, he called on the Peña Nieto administration to &quot;[present] a lawsuit at the United Nations against the U.S. government for violation of human rights and racial discrimination&quot;. He promised to convert the 50 Mexican consulates in the United States into &quot;procurators&quot; for the defense of migrants, suggested appointing Alicia Bárcena, current Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, as Mexico&#x27;s permanent representative to the UN, and pledged to put pressure on the United States through organizations like the United Nations. He accused the establishment parties of the corruption that keeps migrants from receiving the support they need.

Regarding migration to Mexico, he asserted his government would not &quot;continue the dirty work&quot; of the United States and detain Central American migrants at the country&#x27;s southern border. Following his proposed idea of decentralizing the nation&#x27;s cabinet away from Mexico City, he would move the National Institute of Migration to Tijuana, Baja California. He suggested that the NAFTA renegotiations should create a development plan for Central America as a means to address emigration in the region, including a proposed &quot;alliance for progress&quot; including Mexico, the United States, Canada, and Central America to foster job creation, grow the economy and pacify the region. López Obrador said he wants to broker a deal with President Trump to stem illegal immigration through jobs and development rather than a border wall.

López Obrador&#x27;s pick for the proposed re-establishment of the Secretariat of Public Security, Alfonso Durazo, declared in July 2018 that there are plans to create a border police that would mainly patrol Mexico&#x27;s southern border to halt illegal immigration, drugs, and weapons. In October 2018, López Obrador declared working visas for Central American immigrants. Days later, following the arrival of Central American migrant caravans into Mexico en route to the United States, he asked for solidarity with the migrants.

====Election results====
López Obrador won the election on 1 July 2018 with 53% of the popular vote–the first candidate to win an outright majority since 1988, and the first candidate not from the PRI or its predecessors to do so since the Mexican Revolution.

In terms of states won, López Obrador won in a landslide, carrying 31 out of 32 of the country&#x27;s states.

Around 30 minutes after polls closed in the country&#x27;s northwest, José Antonio Meade, speaking at a news conference from PRI headquarters, conceded defeat and wished Andrés Manuel López Obrador &quot;every success&quot;. Ricardo Anaya also conceded defeat within an hour of the polls closing, and independent candidate Jaime Rodríguez Calderón recognized López Obrador&#x27;s victory shortly afterward.

====Presidential transition (July–December 2018)====

López Obrador took office on 1 December 2018. When he was president-elect, he announced he would take a 60% salary pay cut.

Before taking office, from 22 to 25 October, he held an impromptu vote, organized by supporters of his party, on whether or not the New International Airport for Mexico City was to be scrapped, citing that the project was rife with corruption, cronyism, and a waste of taxpayer&#x27;s money. About 70% of the results voted against the continuation of the project. López Obrador proposed expanding the Santa Lucía Air Force Base instead.

In December 2018, López Obrador ordered the creation of a truth commission to re-examine one of the country&#x27;s most notorious unsolved crimes: the kidnapping and presumed murder of 43 trainee teachers who disappeared after an attack by cartel gunmen and police officers.

After the 2018 presidential election, media organizations, including &quot;Forbes,&quot; reported that López Obrador said the victory of his party, Morena, was &quot;La Cuarta Transformación&quot; (The Fourth Transformation). The phrase is a reference to three major historical reforms, namely Mexican independence, the Reform War, and the Mexican Revolution.

Just before his 1 December inauguration, a documentary on López Obrador was broadcast on Now This World.

==Presidency (2018–2024)==
===Exercise of political power===


In his first year, López Obrador&#x27;s approval ratings were high, approximately the same as previous administrations at the same point in their terms. Despite that, there has appeared to be little progress on issues on which he campaigned, which critics pointed out. &quot;The Economist&quot; criticized his first year as lacking in statecraft and abundant in theatrical gestures. In August 2019, Bloomberg News did an extended interview with López Obrador. The China Global Television Network did a short special assessment of López Obrador&#x27;s first year in office.

He argues his presidency is the &quot;Fourth Transformation&quot; in Mexican history, with the first three being the Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821), the War of the Reform (1857–1861), and the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). He invokes imagery likening his presidency to the work of Jesus Christ, with concern for the less fortunate being a top priority under López Obrador. Direct communication with the electorate has become a key feature of his presidency. He holds daily briefings (&quot;mañaneras&quot;) broadcast on state media.

López Obrador stated that citizen forums, consultations, and referendums would be a key part of his decision-making process. Such consultations have been held on major infrastructure projects such as constructing a new airport, an oil refinery, an electric plant, and the Mayan Train. Other consultations have been held on various social issues, and more are planned for the future—including LGBTQ rights and amnesty for low-level drug offenders. In 2020, a judge in Campeche issued an injunction against the Mayan Train, citing its approval in a &quot;simulated consultation&quot;. 

In 2022, he held a referendum on his presidency, winning with more than 90% of the votes but with a low turnout rate of around 18 percent, far below the 40 percent level needed for the poll to be legally binding. Other consultations held in 2018 and 2019 also enjoyed widespread support (70% or more), but were criticized for low turnout (2% or less) and other reasons.

Morning Consult&#x27;s Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, which evaluates the approval rating of 13 world leaders weekly, positioned López Obrador as the second-highest net approval rating as of February 10, 2022.

During his presidency, López Obrador frequently preferred social media blogs and news sites at his briefings and often answered questions only from them. He has also frequently criticized environmentalists, non-governmental organizations, regulatory agencies and social media companies, the latter for alleged political bias. In 2024, a video on his official YouTube channel showing him revealing the phone number of a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter who had investigated his associates&#x27; connections with drug traffickers was taken down by the site, prompting him to accuse the platform of censorship and being taken over by conservatives.

===Anti-corruption===
A top priority during López Obrador&#x27;s campaign was his pledge to end corruption. In 2018, Mexico was on par with Russia at 138 (of 180 countries), according to Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index. López Obrador has made high-profile gestures against corruption, but his critics see them as not getting at the core issue. He stated his administration will no longer employ the agency designed to uncover corruption in government spending, the National Institute for Access to Information and Data Protection (INAI), citing its complicity in covering up high-profile scandals such as the Odebrecht case. Enrique Krauze has criticized López Obrador&#x27;s move, saying &quot;Now there is absolutely no transparency in the use of public money, and, at the same time, the awarding of contracts to companies owned by the president&#x27;s friends.&quot;

López Obrador&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts have concentrated in five areas: illegal fuel sales known as &quot;Huachicolero&quot;, accounting methods and tax fraud, illegal outsourcing, judicial corruption, and money laundering. The &quot;Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera&quot; on 27 December 2019, announced that it has opened investigations into four former governors. In August 2019 Rosario Robles was sent to prison for her involvement in the MXN $7,760 million (US$420 million) &quot;Master Scam&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Estafa Maestra&quot;), and charges against former Pemex officials such as CEO Emilio Lozoya Austin and union leader Carlos Romero Deschamps. In October 2019, a justice of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) was forced to resign due to irregularities involving an irregular bank deposit worth MXN $80 million (US$4 million).

Despite initial praise from human rights group Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) in October 2019 regarding Lopez&#x27; ambitious plan, which introduced anti-corruption prosecutors both at federal and state levels through an independent National Anti-Corruption System, its 2021 report concluded that, while the structure of the System could theoretically work, it had been essentially crippled by the lack of independence or any real autonomy, amongst other factors.

===Education===
In 2019 López Obrador consolidated some projects to support the educational system in Mexico, some of them being the creation of one hundred public universities and the approval of the reforms to articles 3, 31 and 73 of the Mexican Constitution, about education, in which parents, teachers and authorities participated. That same year, he also implemented the scholarship program &quot;Bienestar Benito Juárez&quot; in all educational levels of public service, in order to encourage the permanence of students and also reverted the Education Reform implemented during the Peña Nieto administration, replacing it with one that would guarantee free education at all levels.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, face-to-face classes were suspended since March, in order to avoid contagions of the disease. In August, the president signed an agreement with the television networks Televisa, TV Azteca, Imagen Televisión and Grupo Multimedios so that preschool, primary and secondary school students could begin receiving classes and educational content on television. In December, he announced Delfina Gómez Álvarez as the new secretary of Public Education, replacing Esteban Moctezuma Barragán, who would become Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to the United States. In 2021, a protocol was announced with which students could gradually return to face-to-face classes, but only in those states that were on a green light of the epidemiological traffic light during the COVID pandemic. The exchange between Delfina and Moctezuma was officially carried out on 15 February. The return of face-to-face classes since the beginning of the pandemic took place on 7 June in Mexico City, San Luis Potosí and Aguascalientes, and on the 14 of the same month in the State of Mexico. However, this return was silently canceled again when cases of children infected with COVID-19 began to be registered inside schools, little student presence, and the beginning of a third wave of infections by the disease. Despite this, the president announced that the return of face-to-face classes would be &quot;rained, thundered or lighted&quot; in August, one of his motivations being to avoid the supposed &quot;addiction to video games&quot; that kids have today.

===Economy===

López Obrador&#x27;s energy policy has prioritized the state over the market. Petroleum is at the center of his strategy, with the construction of a refinery in Tabasco, and has essentially banned private investment in the sector. There was low or flat economic growth in his first year of office. He implemented a minimum wage increase of 16.21% in 2019 before uplifting the wage increase to 20% the same year. The coronavirus pandemic is expected to cause lasting damage to the economy, with some critics arguing López Obrador has not effectively planned and responded to economic uncertainty, with the peso falling in the first months of the pandemic. López Obrador made good on his promise to cancel the building of a new airport (Texcoco Airport) to serve Mexico City, with $13.3 billion already spent. Instead, the Felipe Ángeles International Airport was reworked to replace it.

The trade deal with the U.S. and Canada was ratified by all three nations and went into effect in July 2020. López Obrador traveled to the U.S. to sign the agreement, but Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of the third partner, Canada, did not attend, claiming the coronavirus as the reason. Trump and López Obrador signed the agreement at the White House. With the COVID-19 pandemic, remittances from Mexicans in the U.S. have fallen. In addition, with the U.S.-Mexico border increasingly difficult to cross, Mexicans in the U.S. are now aging and dying, often being buried in their hometowns and villages.

His 2023 federal budget prioritized the funding of social programs, including a boost to pensions for older adults and infrastructure projects concentrated largely in southern Mexico. According to José Olivares of &quot;The Intercept&quot;, leaked intelligence documents indicate the U.S. government is displeased with the Mexican state prioritizing social spending over furthering U.S. interests, such as &quot;investments needed to address bilateral issues with the US, such as migration, security and trade.&quot;

===Response to the COVID-19 pandemic===

According to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the initial response by López Obrador&#x27;s government was as late as March 2020 and was met with significant criticism. The president continued to hold rallies, be tactile with crowds, and downplay the threat of coronavirus to Mexicans&#x27; health and the Mexican economy. When COVID-19 arrived in Mexico, the government ramped up preparedness. The healthcare system is undergoing reforms to lessen the possibility of corruption and to shift from the existing insurance system to a universal one. In March 2020, López Obrador pledged to donate a quarter of his salary to help the country weather the pandemic.

As of 25 January 2021, 1,763,219 people have contracted the virus and 149,614 have died.

===Crime and the drug war===

Rates of crime remain high in Mexico and conflict and violence of drug mafias has not been stemmed. The number of murders nationwide in 2019 was over 34,000. Although the rate of women&#x27;s murders is only about 10% of that number, femicide (murders of women specifically because they are women) has risen and resulted in major demonstrations in early 2020.

López Obrador initially backed away from the policy of taking out mafia heads. His policy was not a harsh crackdown, offering &quot;abrazos, no balazos&quot;&quot; (&quot;hugs, not gunshots&quot;), which confused and demoralized the security forces. He then gave the army nation-wide control of security.

A high-profile situation developed in Sinaloa in October 2019 when Ovidio Guzmán López &quot;El Ratón&quot;, son of imprisoned drug mafia head Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, was captured by a small government force. The mafia responded there with a shootout on the Culiacán city streets, resulting in the government freeing Ovidio Guzmán.

On 5 January 2023, after six months of planning and vigilance, another military operation took place that resulted in Oviedo Guzmán being captured once more, this time successfully, resulting in another fight between the Mexican military and the Sinaloa Cartel on the streets of Culiacán. This all resulted in the deaths of 10 soldiers and 19 members of the cartel, along with the arrests of 21 other alleged members, without civilian casualties, according to official reports. Most of these deaths occurred during the initial shootout between the military and the Sinaloa Cartel while Guzmán was being detained. Obrador claimed that the authorities acted &quot;with responsibility&quot; to protect the civilian population and that the operation was done without any involvement from the U.S. government.

Ovidio Guzmán has now been moved to the &quot;Altiplano&quot; maximum security prison in the State of Mexico. He&#x27;s expected to be eventually extradited to the U.S. per request of the U.S. government since September 2019. Still, he will remain in Mexico while various legal proceedings take place, as the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard reported. On the same day, Ernesto Alfredo Piñón de la Cruz &quot;El Neto&quot;, leader of the violent criminal organization affiliated with the Sinaloa Cartel known as &quot;Los Mexicles&quot;, was killed by state and federal police while trying to flee from his residence during a police raid in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, just four days after violently escaping prison. López Obrador has acceded to U.S. requests to extradite criminals to the U.S.

In Michoacán, drug mafias have been extorting avocado producers, an ongoing issue especially following the rise in demand in the U.S. for the crop.

In April 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Mexican drug cartels had been handing out food relief in their core regions. López Obrador called on them instead to end the violence. Cartels have been acting with continued impunity in Mexico City, with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel targeting the chief of its police force, Omar García Harfuch for assassination in an early morning. He survived wounded, but two of his bodyguards and a civilian were killed. López Obrador&#x27;s policy toward drug cartels has been criticized in the press in the United States on an ongoing basis.

Since 2020, a gradual decrease in intentional homicides has been shown nationwide in Mexico. In 2020, the amount of reported intentional homicides was 0.4% less than in 2019, further decreasing by 4.6% in 2021 and again in 2022 by 7.1%. López Obrador stated in his 6 January 2022 report that he plans to continue this trend throughout the rest of his presidency. Despite this, 2019 was one of the most violent years in Mexican history, with 34,690 reported intentional homicides. The reports conclude that nearly half of all intentional homicides in 2022 occurred in six out of 32 states and that 23 states showed a decrease as high as 13%. In the State of Zacatecas, which saw a sharp increase in total homicide rates in 2021 —of 41% in the first 11 months, making it the biggest statewide increase in the country on that year—, intentional homicides decreased by 13.76% and total homicides by 7.57% in 2022, according to the Executive Secretary of the National Public Security System (SESNSP). Though a nationwide decrease has been perceived, some areas have perceived an increase in 2022. In 17 out of the 50 &quot;priority municipalities&quot;, where intentional homicides are concentrated, an average increase of 8.5% in such homicides was reported. In contrast, in 32, an average decrease of 24.3% was reported, with Cuernavaca and Morelos being the only municipalities with no reported changes.

Plans to legalize the personal use of marijuana missed a 24 October 2019 SCJN deadline, which was extended to 30 April 2020, as users, growers, and businesses could not agree on details. In June 2021, the Supreme Court in effect legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

As of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted supply chains from China to Mexico that provided the precursor chemicals to create fentanyl and methamphetamine, usually then exported to the U.S.

On Monday, 22 January 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in favor of the Mexican Government regarding a lawsuit filed against several U.S. firearms producers, annulling the case&#x27;s dismissal by a Massachusetts court in September 2022. The Mexican Government claims that weapons from various gun producers, including Smith &amp; Wesson, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing and several others, are widely used by drug cartels and accuses them of facilitating this through &quot;negligent commercial practices&quot;. The lawsuit was originally filed in August 2021, while Marcelo Ebrard was Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The ruling was celebrated by Ebrard and the current Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alicia Bárcena, who enthusiastically claimed it was a &quot;great step&quot; and &quot;great news&quot;, respectively. Alejandro Celorio, a legal consultant of the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, claims this &quot;is to advance in the accountability of those who negligently trade firearms that violate the peace and security of our country.&quot; That same day, Bárcena reported during a morning press conference that weapons exclusively used by the U.S. military had illegally entered Mexican territory, and that the governments of both countries agreed on Friday to investigate this problem. For these reasons, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar announced that the issue of gun trafficking into Mexico will be central to a meeting between politicians of both countries in February, though he stated he was unaware of the issue regarding U.S. military weapons being smuggled into Mexico and maintains that the authorities of both countries constantly exchange information about the flow of firearms between them. A month prior, Salazar acknowledged that 70% of weapons smuggled into Mexico are of U.S. origin or are manufactured in the U.S. In March 2023, López Obrador claimed that 70% of homicides in Mexico were committed using weapons from the U.S., criticising the U.S. government for this issue.

Just eleven days prior to the Court of Appeals&#x27; ruling, a U.S. citizen was arrested by the Mexican authorities during a routine check in Agua Prieta, Sonora, while attempting to cross the border with Arizona, when it was found that he was trying to smuggle over 1300 .50 caliber cartridges into Mexican territory.

===Response to femicide and women&#x27;s activism===
López Obrador&#x27;s government has been criticized for failing to combat violence against women in Mexico and its high rate of femicide, which has risen since 2018. López Obrador has been accused of being slow to respond to women&#x27;s demands to act on the issue of femicide. After a particularly well-publicized femicide of a kidnapped girl, women marches spiked nationally; as a result, the Head of Government of Mexico City, Claudia Sheinbaum (who is also a member of Morena) announced new measures to prevent further femicides in the city, while López Obrador also announced a package of new measures to address the issue. Soon after, women&#x27;s groups called for two days of action, a massive demonstration in Mexico City on International Women&#x27;s Day (8 March), following by a strike on 9 March 2020. The Mexico City demonstration had some 80,000 participants. On Monday, 9 March 2020, the second day of action was marked by the absence of women at work, in class, shopping and other public activities. The &quot;Day Without Us&quot; (&quot;Día Sin Nosotras&quot;) was reported in the international press along with the previous day&#x27;s demonstrations.

=== Foreign policy ===

On 7 November 2023, López Obrador called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

==== Immigration and U.S. pressure ====

The Trump administration in the U.S. pressed for building a wall on Mexico&#x27;s northern border, and it also implemented measures attempting to stem the flow of migrants from Central America and other regions of the world. Although López Obrador expressed sympathy with migrants during his campaign, when the number of migrants surged, the U.S. threatened his government with trade sanctions, which led him to solidify the southern border. Government forces broke up migrant caravans heading through Mexico to the U.S. At the northern border, Mexico is now the stopping point for migrants sent back to Mexico by U.S. immigration authorities awaiting adjudication of their asylum claims. Citing widespread corruption, López Obrador dismantled the Federal Police and incorporated elements of it into the recently created National Guard, which has been employed to stop Central American immigrants at the southern border.

In March 2023, López Obrador was sharply critical of some &quot;hypocritical&quot; Republican lawmakers, in particular Dan Crenshaw and Marjorie Taylor Greene, for introducing bills that would authorize the U.S. military to invade Mexico and attack drug cartels, declaring that &quot;we remind those hypocritical and irresponsible politicians that Mexico is an independent and free country, not a colony or a protectorate of the United States.&quot;

==== Political asylum of Evo Morales ====
Former Bolivian President Evo Morales, who was forced to resign amid allegations of fraud in October&#x27;s presidential election, fled Bolivia during the night of 11 November 2019 on a plane for Mexico, which offered him asylum. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said his country decided to grant asylum &quot;for humanitarian reasons, and given the urgent situation faced in Bolivia&quot;. AMLO had Mexican government airplane sent to pick him up.

====Views on Donald Trump====
López Obrador defended former U.S. president Donald Trump against a potential indictment, saying that &quot;Right now, former President Trump is declaring that they are going to arrest him. If that were the case...it would be so that his name doesn&#x27;t appear on the ballot.&quot; The same month, he criticized the United States, saying the country is &quot;anti-democratic&quot; in seeking to arrest Julian Assange and deny Trump an opportunity to seek re-election. He also referenced the allegations that the U.S. is responsible for the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, saying, &quot;If we are talking about acts of violence, how is it that an award-winning journalist in the United States claims that the US government sabotaged the gas pipeline from Russia to Europe?&quot; and criticized the fentanyl epidemic in America.

===Environment===
Early in his presidency, López Obrador declared in February 2019 that his government would no longer fund environmental NGOs. Around 6.2 billion Mexican pesos (around USD$321 million at the time) in funding was cut.

In 2020 he cut funding to Mexico&#x27;s national parks service, the National Commission of Protected Areas (CONANP), by 75 percent and also cut 75 percent of the budget of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH which oversees more than 100,000 heritage and archaeological sites, museums and monuments. 

Over the six years of his presidency, López Obrador&#x27;s government continued to cut funding for environmental protection. Between 2018 and 2023, Mexico&#x27;s environment department received 35% less money than under the previous government, according to an analysis of Mexico&#x27;s 2024 budget, including funding cuts to the environmental department of US$510 million (9 billion pesos) or 11% in 2024.

===Plans for historical commemorations===
Major historical commemorations took place in 2021. The events are the founding of Tenochtitlan (although the date of its founding is often given as 1325); the 1521 fall of Tenochtitlan; and the 1821 consummation of Mexican independence. The Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral is being repaired, along with other colonial-era buildings in advance of the commemorations. During conmemorations, he apologized in the name of Mexico to indigenous peoples and Mexicans of Chinese descent for historical abuses. López Obrador invited King Felipe VI of Spain and Pope Francis to Mexico for the commemorations, and asked them to apologize for the conquest of America. The Pope declined the invitation, saying he had apologized in 2015.

=== 2021 midterm elections ===

In the June 2021 midterm elections, López Obrador&#x27;s Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition lost seats in the lower house of Congress. However, his ruling coalition maintained a simple majority, but López Obrador failed to secure a two-thirds congressional supermajority. The main opposition was a coalition of Mexico&#x27;s three traditional parties: the PRI, the PAN, and the PRD.

<text>Mirko Jović (Serbian Cyrillic: Мирко Јовић; born 13 August 1959 in Zemun) is a Serbian politician who stood for president of Serbia in the 2004 Serbian presidential election for the People&#x27;s Radical Party, Serbia and Diaspora, and European Blok. He lives in Belgrade.

==Political career==
Together with Vuk Drašković and Vojislav Šešelj, Jović founded the Serbian National Renewal (SNO) in 1989. However, the trio soon found themselves at political crossroads and their party disintegrated into three pieces by 1990. Jović kept the SNO, Šešelj formed the Serbian Chetnik Movement and then the Serbian Radical Party while Drašković formed the Serbian Renewal Movement.

The unpopularity of the Jović&#x27;s nationalist agenda was most markedly shown in Vojvodina, his home province. This animosity toward the SNO ideology culminated in the spontaneous mass beating of Jović and the leadership of the party during the party meeting in city of Vrbas in 1991. In 1996, the SNO was merged into the Serb Democratic Party.

He was a volunteer soldier in the Bosnian War, where he was the leader of the White Eagles and called for &quot;A Christian, Orthodox Serbia with no Muslims and no unbelievers&quot;. In the 2004 Serbian presidential election he won 5,546 votes or 0.18% of the votes.

He was elected to the National Assembly of Serbia on the Serbian Radical Party list twice, in 2007 and 2008. After the party&#x27;s deputy leader, Tomislav Nikolić, resigned from the SRS and formed the new Serbian Progressive Party, Pelević left the SRS and joined Nikolić&#x27;s group. He was elected MP on the SNS ballot in the 2012 election but soon developed disagreements over SNS policies on Kosovo and the European Union, eventually leaving the SNS and becoming an independent MP.

On 21 January 2013, the SSJ party was re-founded as the Council of Serbian Unity by Pelević, Slobodan Radosavljević and Jelena Kostić in Belgrade. The new party took part in the 2014 parliamentary election as part of the Patriotic Front, but failed to reach the 5% threshold. 

==Death==
He died on 25 October 2018, after a long illness.

<text>Population decline, also known as depopulation, is a reduction in a human population size. Throughout history, Earth&#x27;s total human population has continued to grow; however, current projections suggest that this long-term trend of steady population growth may be coming to an end.

From antiquity until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the global population grew very slowly, at about 0.04% per year. After about 1800, the growth rate accelerated to a peak of 2.1% annually during the 1962–1968 period, but since then, due to the worldwide collapse of the total fertility rate, it has slowed to 0.9% as of 2023.The global growth rate in absolute numbers accelerated to a peak of 92.8 million in 1990, but has since slowed to 70.4 million in 2023.

Long-term projections indicate that the growth rate of the human population of the planet will continue to slow and that before the end of the 21st century, it will reach zero. Examples of this emerging trend are Japan, whose population is currently (2023) declining at the rate of 0.5% per year,and China, whose population has peaked and is currently (2023) declining at the rate of about 0.2% per year. By 2050, Europe&#x27;s population is projected to be declining at the rate of 0.3% per year.

Population growth has declined mainly due to the abrupt decline in the global total fertility rate, from 5.3 in 1963 to 2.2 in 2023. The decline in the total fertility rate has occurred in every region of the world and is a result of a process known as demographic transition. To maintain its population, ignoring migration, a country on average requires a minimum fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman of childbearing age (the number is slightly greater than 2 because not all children live to adulthood). However, most societies experience a drop in fertility to well below 2 as they grow more wealthy. The tendency of women in wealthier countries to have fewer children is attributed to a variety of reasons, such as lower infant mortality and a reduced need for children as a source of family labor or retirement welfare, both of which reduce the incentive to have many children. Better access to education for young women, which broadens their job prospects, is also often cited.

Possible consequences of long-term national population decline can be net negative or positive. If a country can increase its workforce productivity faster than its population is declining, the results, in terms of its economy, the quality of life of its citizens, and the environment, can be net positive. If it cannot increase workforce productivity faster than its population&#x27;s decline, the results can be negative.

National efforts to confront a declining population to date have been focused on the possible negative economic consequences and have been centered on increasing the size and productivity of the workforce.

==Causes==
A reduction over time in a region&#x27;s population can be caused by sudden adverse events such as outbursts of infectious disease, famine, and war or by long-term trends, for example, sub-replacement fertility, persistently low birth rates, high mortality rates, and continued emigration.

===Short-term population shocks===

Historical episodes of short-term human population decline have been common and have been caused by several factors.

High mortality rates caused by:

* Disease, for example, the Black Death that devastated Europe in the 14th and 17th centuries, the arrival of Old World diseases in the Americas during European colonization, and the Spanish flu pandemic after World War I,
* Famine, for example, the Great Irish Famine of the 19th century, and the Great Chinese Famine caused by the Great Leap Forward which caused tens of millions of deaths,
* War, for example, the Mongol invasion of Europe in the 13th century, which may have reduced the population of Hungary by 20–40%,
* Civil unrest, for example, the forced migration of the population of Syria because of the Syrian Civil War.
* A combination of these. The first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars, famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses (approximately 60 million excess deaths).

Less frequently, short-term population declines are caused by genocide or mass execution. For example, it has been estimated that the Armenian genocide caused 1.5 million deaths, the Jewish Holocaust about 6 million, and, during the period 1975 - 1979, the population of Cambodia declined 26% because of wide-scale executions by the Khmer Rouge.

In modern times, the AIDS pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic have caused short-term drops in fertility and significant excess mortality in a number of countries.

Some population declines result from indeterminate causes, for example, the Bronze Age Collapse, which has been described as the worst disaster in ancient history.

=== Long-term historic trends in world population growth ===
In spite of these short-term population shocks, world population has continued to grow. From around 10,000 BC to the beginning of the Early modern period (generally 1500 – 1800), world population grew very slowly, around 0.04% per year. During that period, population growth was governed by conditions now labeled the “Malthusian Trap”.

After 1700, driven by increases in human productivity due to the Industrial Revolution, particularly the increase in agricultural productivity, population growth accelerated to around 0.6% per year, a rate that was over ten times the rate of population growth of the previous 12,000 years. This rapid increase in global population caused Malthus and others to raise the first concerns about overpopulation.

After World War I birth rates in the United States and many European countries fell below replacement level. This prompted concern about population decline. The recovery of the birth rate in most western countries around 1940 that produced the &quot;baby boom&quot;, with annual growth rates in the 1.0 – 1.5% range, and which peaked during the period 1962–1968 at 2.1% per year, temporarily dispelled prior concerns about population decline, and the world was once again fearful of overpopulation.

But after 1968 the global population growth rate started a long decline, and the United Nations Population Division (UN) has reported that in the year 2023 it had dropped to about 0.9%, less than half of its peak during the period 1962 – 1968. Although still growing, the UN predicts that global population will level out around 2084, and some sources predict the start of a decline before then.

The principal cause of this phenomenon is the abrupt decline in the global total fertility rate, from 5.3 in 1963 to 2.2 in 2023, as the world continues to move through the stages of the Demographic Transition. The decline in the total fertility rate has occurred in every region of the world and has brought renewed concern from some for population decline.

The era of rapid global population increase, and concomitant concern about a population explosion, has been short compared with the span of human history. It began roughly at the beginning of the industrial revolution and appears to be now drawing to a close.

==Possible consequences==

Predictions of the &quot;net&quot; economic (and other) effects from a slow and continuous population decline (e.g. due to low fertility rates) are mainly theoretical since such a phenomenon is a relatively new and unprecedented one. The results of many of these studies show that the estimated impact of population growth on economic growth is generally small and can be positive, negative, or nonexistent. A recent meta-study found no relationship between population growth and economic growth.

=== Possible positive effects ===
The effects of a declining population can be positive. The single best gauge of economic success is the growth of GDP per person, not total GDP. GDP per person (also known as GDP per capita or per capita GDP) is a rough proxy for average living standards. A country can both increase its average living standard and grow its total GDP even though its population growth is low or even negative. The economies of both Japan and Germany went into recovery around the time their populations began to decline (2003–2006). In other words, both the total and per capita GDP in both countries grew more rapidly after 2005 than before. Russia&#x27;s economy also began to grow rapidly from 1999 onward, even though its population had been shrinking since 1992–93. Many Eastern European countries have been experiencing similar effects to Russia. Such renewed growth calls into question the conventional wisdom that economic growth requires population growth, or that economic growth is impossible during a population decline.

More recently (2009–2017) Japan has experienced a higher growth of GDP per capita than the United States, even though its population declined over that period. In the United States, the relationship between population growth and growth of GDP per capita has been found to be empirically insignificant. This evidence shows that individual prosperity can grow during periods of population decline.

Attempting to better understand the economic impact of these pluses and minuses, Lee et al. analyzed data from 40 countries. They found that typically fertility well above replacement and population growth would be most beneficial for government budgets. Fertility near replacement and population stability, however, would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. Fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account.

A focus on productivity growth that leads to an increase in both per capita GDP and total GDP can bring other benefits to:

*the workforce through higher wages, benefits and better working conditions
*customers through lower prices
*owners and shareholders through higher profits
*the environment through more money for investment in more stringent environmental protection
*governments through higher tax proceeds to fund government activities

Another approach to possible positive effects of population decline is to consider Earth&#x27;s human carrying capacity. Global population decline would begin to counteract the negative effects of human overpopulation. There have been many estimates of Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity, each generally predicting a high-low range of maximum human population possible. The lowest low estimate is less than one billion, the highest high estimate is over one trillion. A statistical analysis of these historical estimates revealed that the median of high estimates of all of the ranges would be 12 billion, and the median of low estimates would be about 8 billion. According to this analysis, this planet may be entering a zone where its human carrying capacity could be exceeded. However, the large variance in these studies’ estimates diminishes our confidence in them, as such estimates are very difficult to make with current data and methods.

=== Possible negative effects ===
The effects of a declining population can also be negative. As a country&#x27;s population declines, GDP growth may grow even more slowly or may even decline. If the decline in total population is not matched by an equal or greater increase in productivity (GDP/capita), and if that condition continues from one calendar quarter to the next, it follows that a country would experience a decline in GDP, known as an economic recession. If these conditions become permanent, the country could find itself in a permanent recession.

Other possible negative impacts of a declining population are:

* A rise in the dependency ratio which would increase the economic pressure on the workforce
* A loss of culture and the diminishment of trust among citizens
* A crisis in end-of-life care for the elderly because there are insufficient caregivers for them
* Difficulties in funding entitlement programs because there are fewer workers relative to retirees
* A decline in military strength
* A decline in innovation since change comes from the young
* A strain on mental health caused by permanent recession
* Deflation caused by the aging population

All these negative effects could be summarized under the heading of &quot;Underpopulation&quot;.  Underpopulation is usually defined as a state in which a country&#x27;s population has declined too much to support its current economic system.

Population decline can cause internal population pressures that then lead to secondary effects such as ethnic conflict, forced refugee flows, and hyper-nationalism. This is particularly true in regions where different ethnic or racial groups have different growth rates. Low fertility rates that cause long-term population decline can also lead to population aging, an imbalance in the population age structure. Population aging in Europe due to low fertility rates has given rise to concerns about its impact on social cohesion.

A smaller national population can also have geo-strategic effects, but the correlation between population and power is a tenuous one. Technology and resources often play more significant roles. Since World War II, the &quot;static&quot; theory saw a population&#x27;s absolute size as being one of the components of a country&#x27;s national power. More recently, the &quot;human capital&quot; theory has emerged. This view holds that the quality and skill level of a labor force and the technology and resources available to it are more important than simply a nation&#x27;s population size. While there were in the past advantages to high fertility rates, that &quot;demographic dividend&quot; has now largely disappeared.

==Contemporary decline by country==
The table below shows the countries that have been affected by population decline between 2010 and 2020. The term &quot;population&quot; used here is based on the &quot;de facto&quot; definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of the country of origin. This means that population growth in this table includes net changes from immigration and emigration. For a table of natural population changes, see the list of countries by natural increase.

===East Asia===

==== China ====
China&#x27;s population peaked at 1.41 billion in 2021 and began declining in 2022. China recorded more deaths than births for the first time in 2022 with a net decrease of 850 thousand, and this trend continued in 2023 when deaths overnumbered births by a margin of more than 2 million and in 2024 with deaths overnumbering births by 1.4 million.

The UN&#x27;s Population Division, assuming that China&#x27;s total fertility rate will rise from 1 in 2022 to 1.34 by 2100, projects its population to be 633 million by 2100, a decline of about 56%.,

====Japan====
Though Japan&#x27;s natural increase turned negative as early as 2005, the 2010 census result figure was slightly higher, at just above 128 million, than the 2005 census. Factors implicated in the puzzling figures were more Japanese returnees than expected as well as changes in the methodology of data collection. However, the official count put the population as of October 1, 2015, at 127.1 million, down by 947,000 or 0.7% from the previous quinquennial census. The gender ratio is increasingly skewed; some 106 women per 100 men live in Japan. In 2019, Japan&#x27;s population fell by a record-breaking 276,000; if immigration is excluded from the figures, the drop would have been 487,000. Given the population boom of the 1950s and 1960s, the total population is still 52% above 1950 levels.

The UN&#x27;s Population Division, assuming that Japan&#x27;s total fertility rate will rise from 1.2 in 2023 to 1.47 by 2100, projects its population to fall to 77 million by 2100, a decline of about 38%.,

====South Korea====

South Korea&#x27;s total fertility rate has been consistently lower than that of Japan, breaking below 1 in 2018, and fell to 0.778 in 2022. As a result, its population fell in 2020 for the first time in the country&#x27;s history from 51.8 million in 2020 to 51.6 in 2022.

The UN&#x27;s Population Division, assuming that South Korea&#x27;s total fertility rate will rise from 0.72 in 2023 to 1.3 by 2100, projects its population to fall to nearly 22 million by 2100, a decline of about 58%.,

====Taiwan====

Taiwan recorded more deaths than births for the first time in 2020, despite recording virtually no COVID-19 deaths, thus starting an era of demographic decline for the foreseeable future. Taiwan&#x27;s population fell from 23.6 million in 2020 to 23.4 in 2023, while the total fertility rate decreased from 1.05 in 2020 to 0.85 in 2023.

The UN&#x27;s Population Division, assuming that Taiwan&#x27;s total fertility rate will rise from 0.87 in 2023 to 1.33 by 2100, projects its population to fall to 10 million by 2100, a decline of about 57%.,

====Thailand====
Thailand&#x27;s total fertility rate has been consistently lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 since the beginning of the 1990s and reached a new low in 2022, at 1. Thailand &#x27;s population decline started in 2020 and Thailand for the first time recorded more deaths than births in 2021. This negative natural population change amplified in 2022 and 2023 and, in the absence of substantial immigration, this trend will continue in the coming years due to the very low fertility rate.

===Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics===
Population in the ex-USSR and Eastern Europe is rapidly shrinking due to low birth rates, very high death rates (linked to alcoholism and high rates of infectious diseases such as AIDS and TB), as well as high emigration rates. In Russia and the former communist bloc, birth rates fell abruptly after the fall of the Soviet Union, and death rates generally rose sharply. In addition, in the 25 years after 1989, some 20 million people from Eastern Europe are estimated to have migrated to Western Europe or the United States.

====Belarus====
Belarus&#x27;s population peaked at 10,151,806 in the 1989 Census and declined to 9,480,868 as of 2015 as estimated by the state statistical service. This represents a 7.1% decline since the peak census figure.

====Estonia====
In the last Soviet census of 1989, it had a population of 1,565,662, which was close to its peak population. The state statistics reported an estimate of 1,314,370 for 2016. This represents a 19.2% decline since the peak census figure.

====Georgia====
In the last Soviet census of 1989, it had a population of 5,400,841, which was close to its peak population. The state statistics reported an estimate of 4,010,000 for the 2014 Census, which includes estimated numbers for quasi-independent Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This represents a 25.7% decline since the peak census figure, but nevertheless somewhat higher than the 1950 population.

====Latvia====
When Latvia split from the Soviet Union, it had a population of 2,666,567, which was very close to its peak population. The latest census recorded a population of 2,067,887 in 2011, while the state statistics reported an estimate of 1,986,086 for 2015. This represents a 25.5% decline since the peak census figure, with only one of two nations worldwide falling below 1950 levels. The decline is caused by both a negative natural population growth (more deaths than births) and a negative net migration rate. As of 1 May 2024, Latvia had a total population of 1,862,700.

====Lithuania====
When Lithuania split from the Soviet Union, it had a population of 3.7 million, which was close to its peak population. The latest census recorded a population of 3.05 million in 2011, down from 3.4 million in 2001, further falling to 2,988,000 on September 1, 2012.
This represents a 23.8% decline since the peak census figure, and some 13.7% since 2001.

====Ukraine====

Ukraine census in 1989 resulted in 51,452,034 people. Ukraine&#x27;s own estimates show a peak of 52,244,000 people in 1993; however, this number has plummeted to 45,439,822 as of December 1, 2013. Having lost Crimean territory to Russia in early 2014 and subsequently experiencing war, the population dropped to 42,981,850 as of August 2014. This represents a 19.7% decrease in total population since the peak figure, but 16.8% above the 1950 population even without Crimea. Its absolute total decline (9,263,000) since its peak population is the highest of all nations; this includes loss of territory and heavy net emigration. Eastern Ukraine may yet lose many Russian-speaking citizens due to the new Russian citizenship law. An editorial projects significant gender and age imbalance in the population in Ukraine as a substantial problem if most refugees, as in other cases, do not return over time. Approximately 3.8 million more people have left the country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and thousands have died in the conflict.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine considerably deepened the country&#x27;s demographic crisis. The birth rate in Ukraine was 28% lower in the first six months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2021. A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that &quot;[r]egardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.&quot;

====Hungary====
Hungary&#x27;s population peaked in 1980, at 10,709,000, and has continued its decline to under 10 million as of August 2010. This represents a decline of 7.1% since its peak; however, compared to neighbors situated to the East, Hungary peaked almost a decade earlier yet the rate has been far more modest, averaging −0.23% a year over the period.

===Balkans===

====Albania====
Albania&#x27;s population in 1989 recorded 3,182,417 people, the largest for any census. Since then, its population declined to an estimated 2,893,005 in January 2015. The decline has since accelerated with a 1.3% drop in population reported in 2021 leaving a total population of 2.79 million. This represents a decrease of 12% in total population since the peak census figure.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s population peaked at 4,377,033 in the 1991 Census, shortly before the Yugoslav wars that produced tens of thousands of civilian victims and refugees. The latest census of 2016 reported a population of 3,511,372. This represents a 19.8% decline since the peak census figure.

====Bulgaria====

Bulgaria&#x27;s population declined from a peak of 9,009,018 in 1989 and since 2001, has lost yet another 600,000 people, according to 2011 census preliminary figures to no more than 7.3 million, further down to 7,245,000. This represents a 24.3% decrease in total population since the peak and a −0.82% annual rate in the last 10 years.

The Bulgarian population has fallen by more than 844,000 people, or 11.5 percent, in the last decade, the National Institute of Statistics in Sofia said during a presentation of the results so far of the 2021 census, the first since 2011.

The country currently employs just over 6.5 million people, compared to 7.3 million in the previous workforce.

====Croatia====
Croatia&#x27;s population declined from 4,784,265 in 1991 to 4,456,096 (by the old statistical method) of which 4,284,889 are permanent residents (by the new statistical method), in 2011, a decline of 8% (11.5% by the new definition of permanent residency in 2011 census). The main reasons for the decline since 1991 are: low birth rates, emigration and war in Croatia. From 2001 and 2011 main reason for the drop in population is due to a difference in the definition of permanent residency used in censuses till 2001 (censuses of 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) and the one used in 2011. By 2021 the population dropped to 3,888,529, a 9.25% decrease from 2011 numbers.

====Greece====
Greece&#x27;s population declined by about half a million people between its 2011 and 2021 censuses. The main drivers are increased emigration rates and lower birth rates following the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

====Romania====
Romania&#x27;s 1991 census showed 23,185,084 people, and the October 2011 census recorded 20,121,641 people, while the state statistical estimate for 2014 is 19,947,311. This represents a decrease of 16.2% since the historical peak in 1991.

====Serbia====
Serbia recorded a peak census population of 7,822,795 in 1991 in the Yugoslav era, falling to 7,186,862 in the 2011 census. That represents a decline of 5.1% since its peak census figure.

=== Other ===

==== Italy ====
Although Italy had recorded more deaths than births continuously since 1993, the country&#x27;s population only peaked in 2015 at 60,796,000 due to substantial immigration. The Italian population fell by a record amount in 2020, and in 2021, it recorded the lowest number of births since its unification in 1861 at only 399,431, with its population being projected to shrink to 47.2 million in 2070, a decline of nearly 20 percent.

As of April 2024, Italian population stands at 58,968,501 inhabitants.

==== Uruguay ====
Uruguay&#x27;s fertility rate had been consistently low in Latin America since the 20th century at 3 children per women, with the fertility rates in Latin American countries converging at 2 children beginning in the 1990s, but Uruguay&#x27;s fertility rate declined sharply from 2 in 2015 to 1.28 in 2022, largely due to decreased births to women under 20. Uruguay recorded more deaths than births for the first time in 2021 and the population decline has been only offset slightly by immigration.

==== Venezuela ====
In spite of a positive natural increase of almost 1% per year, Venezuela&#x27;s population has declined during the 2015-20 period due to emigration caused by threats of violence as well as shortages of basic needs.

==Resumed declines==

=== Russia ===

The decline in Russia&#x27;s total population is among the largest in numbers, but not in percentage. After having peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, the population then decreased, falling to 142,737,196 by 2008. This represents a 4.0% decrease in total population since the peak census figure. However, the Russian population then rose to 146,870,000 in 2018. This recent trend can be attributed to a lower death rate, higher birth rate, the annexation of Crimea and continued immigration, mostly from Ukraine and Armenia. It is some 40% above the 1950 population.

Russia has become increasingly reliant on immigration to maintain its population; 2021 had the highest net immigration since 1994, despite which there was a small overall decline from 146.1 million to 145.4 million in 2021, the largest decline in over a decade. The natural death rate in January 2020, 2021, and 2022 have each been nearly double the natural birth rate.

In March 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;Over the past three years the country has lost around 2 million more people than it would ordinarily have done, as a result of war [in Ukraine], disease and exodus.&quot; According to Russian economist Alexander Isakov, &quot;Russia’s population has been declining and the war will reduce it further. Reasons? Emigration, lower fertility and war-related casualties.&quot;

According to the analysis of economists Oleg Itskhoki and Maxim Mironov, Russia may lose more than 10% of men aged 20–29 as a result of losses in the war and emigration. In June 2024, it was estimated that approximately 2% of all Russian men between the ages of 20 and 50 may have been killed or seriously wounded in Ukraine since February 2022.

The UN is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue, and if current demographic conditions persist, Russia&#x27;s population would be 120 million in fifty years, a decline of about 17%., The UN&#x27;s 2024 scenarios project Russia&#x27;s population to be between 74 million and 112 million in 2100, a decline of 25 to 50%.

=== Portugal ===
Between 2011 and 2021, Portugal&#x27;s population declined from 10.56 to 10.34 million people. The fertility rate has been consistently below 2 since the early 1980s, and the gap is increasingly being made up by immigrants.

== Purportedly halted declines ==
===Armenia===
Armenia&#x27;s population peaked at 3,604,000 in 1991 and declined to a post-Soviet low of 2,961,500 at the beginning of 2020, in spite of a continuous natural population increase. This represented a 17.2% decrease in the total population since the peak census figure. Armenia&#x27;s population began to increase again to 2,962,300 in 2021; 2,969,200 in 2022 and 2,990,900 in 2023. As of the beginning of 2024 the population had rebounded to 3,015,400 at 1978 levels.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, a continuously low birth rate has been offset by waves of immigration. From 2002 to 2011 the population declined by 2 million, the most since the Cold War. The 2011 national census recorded a population of 80.2 million people, following which official estimates showed an increase of 3 million over the next decade. The official estimate for 2020 was a slight decrease from 2019. Third-party estimates show a slight increase, instead.

=== Ireland ===
In the current area of the Republic of Ireland, the population has fluctuated dramatically. The population of Ireland was 8 million in 1841, but it dropped due to the Irish famine and later emigration. The population of the Republic of Ireland hit a bottom at 2.8 million in the 1961 census, but it then rose and in 2011 it was 4.58 million. As of 2020, it is estimated to be just under 5 million according to the country&#x27;s Central Statistics Office.

=== Poland ===
The population of Poland in the last 20 years has caused many years of recorded growth and decline with the population. The recorded population of Poland between 2002 and 2006 had shown a decreasing trend while between 2007 and 2012 the population had an increasing trend. Though since 2020, COVID-19 has started to cause the population to decline rapidly, with over 117,000 people reportedly dying from COVID-19 in Poland by October 2022. However, Poland also saw a large number of Ukrainian Refugees move into Poland, with over 7.8 million people having crossed the border by October 2022 between Poland and Ukraine since the war began, of which 1.4 million have stayed in Poland.

=== Syria ===
Syria&#x27;s population declined during the period 2012 - 2018 due to an ongoing civil war. During that period many Syrians emigrated to other Middle eastern countries. The civil war makes an accurate count of the Syrian population difficult, but the UN estimates that it peaked in 2012 at 22.9 million and dropped to 18.9 million in 2018, a decline of 17%. Since then Syria&#x27;s population has resumed growing, and the UN projects that by 2025 it will have reached 24.9 million.

==Declines within regions or ethnic groups of a country==
===United States===


In spite of a growing population at a national level, some formerly large American municipalities have dramatically shrunk after the Second World War, and in particular during the 1950s–1970s, due to suburbanization, urban decay, race riots, high crime rates, deindustrialization and emigration from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt. For instance, Detroit&#x27;s population peaked at almost 2 million in 1953, and then declined to less than 700,000 by 2020. Other cities whose populations have dramatically shrunk since the 1950s include Baltimore, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Flint, Gary, New Orleans, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Scranton, Youngstown and Wilmington (Delaware). In addition, the depopulation of the Great Plains, caused by a very high rate of rural flight from isolated agricultural counties, has been going on since the 1930s.

In addition, starting from the 1950s, the United States has witnessed the phenomenon of the white flight or white exodus, the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites, from older, inner suburbs to rural areas, as well as from the U.S. Northeast and Midwest to the warmer climate in the Southeast and Southwest. Migration of middle-class white populations was observed during the Civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s out of cities such as Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City and Oakland, although racial segregation of public schools had ended there long before the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27; decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954. In the 1970s, attempts to achieve effective desegregation (or &quot;integration&quot;) using forced busing in some areas led to more families moving out of former areas. More recently, as of 2018, California had the largest ethnic/racial minority population in the United States; Non-Hispanic whites decreased from about 76.3 – 78% of the state&#x27;s population in 1970 to 36.6%% in 2018 and 39.3% of the total population was Hispanic-Latino (of any race).

A combination of long-term trends, housing affordability, falling birthrates and rising death rates from the COVID-19 pandemic have caused as many as 16 US states to start declining in population.

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&#x27;s population peaked in 2000 at 3.8 million and has since declined to 3.3 million in 2020, due to a negative natural change, and emigration, due to natural disasters and economic difficulties.

===France===

The term &#x27;Empty diagonal&#x27; is used for French departments that have low or declining populations. Due to continued emigration, many departments in France are seeing declines in population, including: Aisne, Allier, Ardennes, Cantal, Charente, Cher, Corrèze, Creuse, Dordogne, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Haute-Marne, Haute-Saône, Haute-Vienne, Indre, Jura, Loir-et-Cher, Lot-et-Garonne, Lozère, Manche, Marne, Mayenne, Meuse, Moselle, Nièvre, Orne, Paris, Sarthe, Somme, Territoire de Belfort, Vosges and Yonne. For more information, see the List of French departments by population.

===South Africa===

The term &#x27;white flight&#x27; has also been used for large-scale post-colonial emigration of whites from Africa, or parts of that continent, driven by levels of violent crime and anti-colonial state policies. In recent decades, there has been a steady and proportional decline in South Africa&#x27;s white community, due to higher birth rates among other South African ethnic groups, as well as a high rate of emigration. In 1977, there were 4.3 million White South Africans, constituting 16.4% of the population at the time. An estimated 800,000 emigrated between 1995 and 2016, citing crime and a lack of employment opportunities. It may also be noted that in recent times, a large proportion of white South African emigrants have chosen to return home. For instance, in May 2014, Homecoming Revolution estimated that around 340,000 white South Africans had returned to South Africa in the preceding decade. Furthermore, immigration from Europe has also supplemented the white population. The 2011 census found that 63,479 white people living in South Africa were born in Europe; of these, 28,653 had moved to South Africa since 2001.

=== India ===
The Parsis of India have one of the lowest fertility rates in the world (0.8 children per woman in 2017); this coupled with emigration has resulted in population decline at least since the 1940s. Their population has more than halved from its peak.

=== Lebanon ===
Lebanon has recorded major waves of emigration from the late 19th century to early 20th century and during the Lebanese Civil War which led to the exodus of almost one million people from Lebanon. Due to the Syrian refugee crisis, according to the UN&#x27;s population division, Lebanon&#x27;s population increased massively from 5.05 million in 2011 to 6.5 million in 2015, but the population began declining again in 2016, with a total population of 6.26 million, 6.11 million in 2017, 5.95 million in 2018, and 5.76 million in 2019. Between 2018 and 2023, the decline in the number of Lebanese accelerated from 25,000 per year to 78,000 due to massive emigration caused by the Lebanese liquidity crisis.

However, the number of births to refugees has been increasing and the country hosts a large population of unregistered refugees, other illegal residents, and other people without legal documentation, making it difficult to count the population of Lebanon. Dr. Ali Faour, a population affairs researcher, estimates the Lebanese population including undocumented migrants to be 8 million. Regardless, the population of Lebanese nationality continues to age and decline as financial struggles increase emigration and decrease marriages. Consequentially, the share of Lebanese nationals in Lebanon may have decreased to between 45 and 50 percent, a sharp decline from 80 percent in 2004, although a 2024 report estimated the share at 65 to 69 percent of the resident population.

Regionally, the mountainous and Christian-majority areas have low fertility rates comparable to European nations, with most of the population increase being concentrated in northern Lebanon.

==National efforts to confront declining populations==

A country with a declining population will struggle to fund public services such as health care, old age benefits, defense, education, water and sewage infrastructure, etc. To maintain some level of economic growth and continue to improve its citizens’ quality of life, national efforts to confront declining populations will tend to focus on the threat of a declining GDP. Because a country&#x27;s GDP is dependent on the size and productivity of its workforce, a country confronted with a declining population, will focus on increasing the size and productivity of that workforce.

=== Increase the size of the workforce ===
A country&#x27;s workforce is that segment of its working-age population that is employed. Working age population is generally defined as those people aged 15–64.

Policies that could increase the size of the workforce include:

* Natalism

Natalism is a set of government policies and cultural changes that promote parenthood and encourage women to bear more children. These generally fall into three broad categories:

# Financial incentives. These may include child benefits and other public transfers that help families cover the cost of children.
# Support for parents to combine family and work. This includes maternity-leave policies, parental-leave policies that grant (by law) leaves of absence from work to care for their children, and childcare services.
# Broad social change that encourages children and parenting

For example, Sweden built up an extensive welfare state from the 1930s and onward, partly as a consequence of the debate following &quot;Crisis in the Population Question&quot;, published in 1934. Today, (2017) Sweden has extensive parental leave that allows parents to share 16 months of paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.

Other examples include Romania&#x27;s natalist policy during the 1967–90 period and Poland&#x27;s 500+ program.

* Encourage more women to join the workforce. 

Encouraging those women in the working-age population who are not working to find jobs would increase the size of the workforce. Female participation in the workforce currently (2018) lags men&#x27;s in all but three countries worldwide. Among developed countries, the workforce participation gap between men and women can be especially wide. For example, currently (2018), in South Korea 59% of women work compared with 79% of men, and currently (2023) in India, only 33% of women are working.

However, even assuming that more women would want to join the workforce, increasing their participation would give these countries only a short-term increase in their workforce, because at some point a participation ceiling is reached, further increases are not possible, and the impact on GDP growth ceases.

* Stop the decline of men in the workforce.

In the United States, the labor force participation of men has been falling since the late 1960s. The labor force participation rate is the ratio between the size of the workforce and the size of the working-age population. In 1969 the labor force participation rate of men in their prime years of 25–54 was 96% and in 2023 was 89%. 
* Raise the retirement age.
Raising the retirement age has the effect of increasing the working-age population, but raising the retirement age requires other policy and cultural changes if it is to have any impact on the size of the workforce:

# Pension reform. Many retirement policies encourage early retirement. For example, in 2018 less than 10% of Europeans between ages 64–74 were employed. Instead of encouraging work after retirement, many public pension plans restrict earnings or hours of work.
# Workplace cultural reform. Employer attitudes towards older workers must change. Extending working lives will require investment in training and working conditions to maintain the productivity of older workers.

One study estimated that increasing the retirement age by 2–3 years per decade between 2010 and 2050 would offset declining working-age populations faced by &quot;old&quot; countries such as Germany and Japan.
* Increase immigration. 
A country can increase the size of its workforce by importing more migrants into their working age population. Even if the indigenous workforce is declining, qualified immigrants can reduce or even reverse this decline. However, this policy can only work if the immigrants can join the workforce and if the indigenous population accepts them.

For example, starting in 2019 Japan, a country with a declining workforce, will allow five-year visas for 250,000 unskilled guest workers. Under the new measure, between 260,000 and 345,000 five-year visas will be made available for workers in 14 sectors suffering severe labor shortages, including caregiving, construction, agriculture and shipbuilding.

* Reduce emigration.

The table above shows that long-term persistent emigration, often caused by what is called &quot;Brain Drain&quot;, is often one of the major causes of a county&#x27;s population decline. However, research has also found that emigration can have net positive effects on sending countries, so this would argue against any attempts to reduce it.

=== Increase the productivity of the workforce ===

Development economists would call increasing the size of the workforce &quot;extensive growth&quot;. They would call increasing the productivity of that workforce &quot;intensive growth&quot;. In this case, GDP growth is driven by increased output per worker, and by extension, increased GDP/capita.

In the context of a stable or declining population, increasing workforce productivity is better than mostly short-term efforts to increase the size of the workforce. Economic theory predicts that in the long term, most growth will be attributable to intensive growth, that is, new technology and new and better ways of doing things plus the addition of capital and education to spread them to the workforce.

Increasing workforce productivity through intensive growth can only succeed if workers who become unemployed through the introduction of new technology can be retrained so that they can keep their skills current and not be left behind. Otherwise, the result is technological unemployment. Funding for worker retraining could come from a robot tax, although the idea is controversial.

==Long-term future trends==
A long-term population decline is typically caused by sub-replacement fertility, coupled with a net immigration rate that fails to compensate for the excess of deaths over births. A long-term decline is accompanied by population aging and creates an increase in the ratio of retirees to workers and children. When a sub-replacement fertility rate remains constant, population decline accelerates over the long term.

Because of the global decline in the fertility rate, projections of future global population show a marked slowing of population growth and the possibility of long-term decline.

The table below summarizes the United Nations projections for future population growth. Any such long-term projections are necessarily highly speculative. The UN divides the world into six regions. Under their projections, during the period 2045–2050, Europe&#x27;s population will be in decline and all other regions will experience significant reductions in growth; then, by the end of the 21st century (the period 2095–2100) three of these regions will be showing population decline and global population will have peaked and started to decline.
Note: the UN&#x27;s methods for generating these numbers are explained at this reference.

The table shows UN predictions of long-term decline of population growth rates in every region; however, short-term baby booms and healthcare improvements, among other factors, can cause reversals of trends. Population declines in Russia (1994–2008), Germany (1974–1984), and Ireland (1850–1961) have seen long-term reversals. The UK, having seen almost zero growth during the period 1975–1985, is now (2015–2020) growing at 0.6% per year.

<text>Air Canada Flight 797 was an international passenger flight operating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Montréal–Dorval International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Toronto Pearson International Airport. 

On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire in air around the rear lavatory that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that disabled most of the instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane&#x27;s interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers—half of the people on board—who were unable to evacuate the aircraft.

The accident became a watershed for global aviation regulations, which were changed in the aftermath of the accident to make aircraft safer. New requirements to install smoke detectors in lavatories, strip lights marking paths to exit doors, and increased firefighting training and equipment for crew became standard across the industry, while regulations regarding evacuation were also updated. Since the accident, it has become mandatory for aircraft manufacturers to prove their aircraft could be evacuated within 90 seconds of the commencement of an evacuation, and passengers seated in overwing exits are now instructed to assist in an emergency.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, MSN 47196, originally registered as CF-TLU, that was manufactured in 1968 and was delivered to Air Canada on April 7. It had logged 36,825 airframe hours and 34,987 takeoff and landing cycles and was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-7B engines. The aircraft was re-registered to C-FTLU on January 1, 1974.

==Flight and crew==

At 16:25 Central Daylight Time (21:25 UTC) on 2 June 1983, Flight 797 took off from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight operated by Air Canada using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 (aircraft registration ). The flight was scheduled to make a stop at Toronto International Airport, ultimately bound for Montreal&#x27;s Dorval Airport.

The flight&#x27;s captain, Donald Cameron (age 51), had been employed by Air Canada since March 1966, and had qualified as a DC-9 captain in November 1974. At the time of the accident, Cameron had approximately 13,000 flight hours, of which 4,939 were in the DC-9. First Officer Claude Ouimet (age 34) had flown for Air Canada since November 1973. He had about 5,650 hours of flight experience, including 2,499 hours in the DC-9, and had qualified as a DC-9 first officer in February 1979.

==Incident==
===Fire===
While the flight was over Louisville, Kentucky, a fire started in or around the rear lavatory of the aircraft. The pilots heard a popping sound around 18:51 EDT (22:51 UTC), during dinner service, and discovered that the lavatory&#x27;s circuit breakers had tripped. Captain Cameron&#x27;s initial attempt to reset the circuit breakers was unsuccessful. It was not uncommon for a plane&#x27;s lavatory circuits to pop occasionally, precipitated by a large number of passengers using the toilet after eating, so Cameron waited around eight minutes to give the tripped circuits time to cool down before attempting to reset them again at 18:59. The captain observed that the circuit breakers popped back out as he pushed them to reset.

At about 19:00, a passenger seated in the last row informed flight attendant Judi Davidson of a strange odor in the rear of the airplane. Davidson traced the odor to the aft lavatory. Davidson attempted to check on the lavatory by opening the door a few inches. At that time she observed the lavatory full of light grey smoke, but did not see flames. Davidson asked flight attendant Laura Kayama to find chief flight attendant Sergio Benetti, who entered the lavatory to investigate.

Benetti saw no flames, but did see curls of thick black smoke coming out from the seams around the walls of the lavatory. While Benetti sprayed the interior of the lavatory with a CO2 fire extinguisher, Kayama moved passengers on the sparsely-populated flight forward, and opened air vents to let more fresh air into the cabin. Kayama also went to the cockpit, and at 19:02, informed the flight crew of a &quot;fire in the washroom&quot;. Captain Cameron put on his oxygen mask and ordered First Officer Ouimet to go back and investigate.

Ouimet found that thick smoke was filling the last three to four rows of seats, and he could not reach the aft lavatory. Benetti informed Ouimet that he did not see the source of the fire, but had doused the lavatory with fire retardant. Benetti told Ouimet that he did not believe the fire was in the trash bin.

At 19:04, Ouimet returned to the cockpit, told Cameron about the smoke, and suggested descending. However, Ouimet did not report Benetti&#x27;s comment that the fire was not a mere trash bin fire. A few seconds later, Benetti came to the cockpit and told the captain that passengers were moved forward and that the smoke was &quot;easing up.&quot; Cameron sent Ouimet back to try inspecting the aft lavatory again.

At 19:06, while Ouimet was out of the cockpit, Benetti again told Cameron that he thought the smoke was clearing. The captain, still believing the fire was in the lavatory trash bin, had not started descending because he expected the fire would be put out. Shortly after, the &quot;master caution&quot; light in the cockpit illuminated, indicating a loss of main bus electrical power. The captain called the air traffic controller (ATC) in Indianapolis, Indiana, and notified them that Flight 797 had an &quot;electrical problem.&quot; Flight 797&#x27;s transponder signal then disappeared from ATC radar displays; ATC was able to monitor the flight by switching to primary radar tracking.

At 19:07, Ouimet reached the aft lavatory again. He reached to open the door, but because it felt hot to the touch, he decided not to open it. Ouimet directed the flight attendants to keep the lavatory door closed, then returned to the cockpit, where he told Cameron, &quot;I don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s happening, I think we better go down, okay?&quot; Cameron detected urgency in Ouimet&#x27;s voice, which he took to mean an immediate descent was needed.

Just after Ouimet returned to the cockpit, the cockpit &quot;master warning&quot; light lit up, warning the pilots of a loss of emergency electrical power. Cameron ordered Ouimet to switch to battery power, but the loss of main and emergency electrical power caused some electrical systems to fail, including power for the horizontal stabilizer. This caused the stabilizer to be stuck in the cruising position. This made controlling the plane&#x27;s descent extremely difficult and required great physical exertion from the pilot and first officer. In addition, both flight recorders stopped recording at this point.

===Descent===
At 19:08 (23:08 UTC), Captain Cameron began an emergency descent and declared &quot;mayday, mayday, mayday&quot; to Indianapolis ATC. Controllers granted Flight 797 clearance to descend for an emergency landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Boone County, Kentucky, near Cincinnati, Ohio. Because the loss of electrical power had impaired some flight instruments, controllers had to direct Flight 797 to the airport using a &quot;no gyro&quot; approach, with the controller observing Flight 797 on radar and directing the flight to make turns based on radar position and heading.

Smoke filled the passenger cabin and entered the cockpit as the plane descended. The PA system also failed, leaving the flight attendants unable to communicate efficiently with the passengers. Nevertheless, attendants were able to move all passengers forward of row 13, and to instruct passengers sitting in exit rows on how to open the doors, a practice that was not standard on commercial airline flights at the time.

===Landing and evacuation===

At 19:20 (23:20 UTC), Captain Cameron and First Officer Ouimet executed an extremely difficult landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Four tires blew out during the landing. Once the plane came to a stop, chief flight attendant Sergio Benetti opened the front door of the aircraft, through which he escaped. The pilots quickly shut the airplane down. The overwing and forward aircraft doors were opened, and slides at the front doors were deployed. The three flight attendants and 18 of the passengers evacuated using these exits. Opening the doors also caused an influx of air that fuelled the fire.

The pilots were unable to enter the passenger cabin because of the smoke and heat. Ouimet escaped through the right emergency window shortly after the plane landed, but Cameron, who was exhausted from trying to keep the plane under control, was unable to move and barely conscious. Firefighters doused Cameron in firefighting foam through the right window, shocking him back to awareness. Cameron was then able to open the left emergency escape window and drop to the ground, where Ouimet dragged him to safety. Cameron was the last person to escape the plane.

Less than 90 seconds after touchdown, the interior of the plane flashed over and ignited, killing the remaining 23 passengers on board, who died from smoke inhalation and burns from the flash fire. Of the 18 surviving passengers, three received serious injuries, 13 received minor injuries and two were uninjured. None of the five crew members sustained any injuries. Survivor Dianne Fadley remarked: &quot;It was almost like anybody who got out had nothing wrong... You made it and you were completely fine, or you didn&#x27;t make it.&quot; The fire completely destroyed the aircraft.

Twenty-one Canadians and two Americans died. Many of the victims&#x27; bodies were burned beyond recognition. Almost all of the victims were in the forward half of the aircraft between the wings and the cockpit. Some victims were found in the aisle, while others were still in their seats. Two victims were found in the rear of the aircraft even though all passengers had been moved forward after the fire had been detected; these two victims were likely disoriented in the confusion that ensued upon landing and evacuation. Blood samples from the bodies revealed high levels of cyanide, fluoride and carbon monoxide, chemicals produced by the burning plane.

==Investigation==
Because the accident occurred in the United States, it was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

Although the fuselage was nearly destroyed by the intensity of the fire, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were still in good condition and produced vital data for the NTSB investigation. On the CVR, NTSB investigators heard eight sounds of electrical arcing beginning at 18:48. The arcing sounds repeated each time that the crew tried to reset the lavatory circuit breakers. Both pilots testified that they did not hear any arcing, and the NTSB concluded that these sounds would be inaudible to the flight crew. Although a number of wires in the lavatory section were later found with insulation stripped away, NTSB investigators were unable to determine whether this insulation damage was the cause of the fire or was caused by the fire.

This particular DC-9 had experienced a number of problems over the months leading up to the incident; 76 maintenance reports had been filed in the plane&#x27;s logs in the previous year, and the CVR recorded Captain Cameron telling First Officer Ouimet to &quot;put [the tripping breakers] in the book there&quot; when the breakers failed to respond to the first reset attempt at 18:52. Cameron attempted once more to reset the breakers at 18:59. The CVR recorded arcing sounds followed by the popping sound of the breakers continuing to trip again after each reset over the next 60 seconds.

On 17 September 1979, the plane, then serving as Air Canada Flight 680 from Boston, Massachusetts, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, had suffered an explosive decompression in the rear bulkhead that required rebuilding the tail section and replacing or splicing most of the wiring and hydraulic lines in the back of the plane. Cameron later noted that the Air Canada maintenance crew &quot;did a heck of a job getting everything put back together&quot; after the decompression incident. Investigators were unable to find signs of arcing in any of the wire splices from the repairs done four years earlier, though much of the wiring in the rear of the plane was severely damaged or destroyed by the fire itself.

===Initial findings===
The NTSB was ultimately unable to determine the origin of the fire. In August 1984, the NTSB issued a final report that, while praising the captain for &quot;exhibiting outstanding airmanship without which the airplane and everyone on board would certainly have perished&quot;, concluded that the probable causes were a fire of undetermined origin, the flight crew&#x27;s underestimation of the fire&#x27;s severity and conflicting fire-progress information given to the captain. This report also found that the flight crew&#x27;s &quot;delayed decision to institute an emergency descent&quot; contributed to the severity of the accident.

===Outcome and revised report===

Captain Cameron later said:

After the NTSB issued its report, a number of commercial pilots and airline personnel petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. In addition, First Officer Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew&#x27;s actions, including the decision to land in Cincinnati instead of at Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to Flight 797 when the crew first declared an emergency. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron&#x27;s difficulties in controlling the plane.

In January 1986, after reviewing Ouimet&#x27;s missive and reevaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of its accident report. The revised report included Ouimet&#x27;s explanation of the landing decision. The report was still critical of Cameron&#x27;s decision not to inquire about the fire itself. However, in its revised report, the NTSB revised its probable-cause finding to describe the fire reports given to Cameron as &quot;misleading&quot; instead of merely &quot;conflicting&quot; information. The NTSB also removed the word &quot;delayed&quot; from its description of the pilots&#x27; decision to descend, instead listing the &quot;time taken to evaluate the nature of the fire and to decide to initiate an emergency descent&quot; as a contributing factor.

The crew of Flight 797 were later honoured by multiple Canadian aviation organizations for their heroic actions in landing the plane safely.

===Safety recommendations===

As a result of this accident and other incidents of in-flight fires on passenger aircraft, the NTSB issued several recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including:

* Safety Recommendation A-83-70, which asked the FAA to expedite actions to require smoke detectors in lavatories.
* Safety Recommendation A-83-71, which asked the FAA to require the installation of automatic fire extinguishers adjacent to and in lavatory waste receptacles.
* Strong recommendation for expedited FAA rule changes mandating that all U.S.-based air carriers install (or improve existing) in-cabin fire safety enhancements, including (but not limited to):
** Fire-blocking seat materials to limit both the spread of fire and the generation of toxic chemicals through ignition.
** Emergency track lighting at or near the floor, strong enough to cut through heavy fuel fire smoke.
** Raised markings on overhead bins indicating the location of exit rows to aid passengers in locating these rows in case of passenger visual impairment (either preexisting or caused by emergency conditions).
** Hand-held fire extinguishers using advanced technology extinguishing agents such as halon.

==Notable passengers==
Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers, 33, was killed by smoke inhalation. Rogers was known for songs such as &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, &quot;The Mary Ellen Carter&quot;, and &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot;. He was returning home after attending the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas.

George Curtis Mathes Jr., the chairman of the board and public face of the Curtis Mathes Corporation, a maker of high-end home electronics, was also killed in the incident.

==Aftermath==
After the incident, Air Canada sold the right wing of the DC-9 to Ozark Air Lines to repair an airplane damaged on 20 December 1983, when Ozark Flight 650, tail number collided with a snowplow in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, killing the snowplow operator and separating the right wing from the aircraft.

==Dramatizations==

The Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (also titled &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot;, &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot;) featured the accident in a 2007 episode titled &quot;Fire Fight&quot;, which includes interviews with survivors and accident investigators as well as a dramatic recreation of the flight.

It is featured in season 1, episode 4, of the TV show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;.

<doc id="720617" wikidata="Q621682" url="?curid=720617" title="Appomattox River">
<text>The Appomattox River is a tributary of the James River, approximately long, in central and eastern Virginia, named for the Appomattocs Indian tribe who lived along its lower banks in the 17th century. It drains a cotton and tobacco-growing region of the Piedmont and coastal plain southwest of Richmond.

==Course==
The Appomattox River rises in the middle of a field near State Route 656 (Horseshoe Road) in the Piedmont of northeastern Appomattox County, approximately northeast of the town of Appomattox. It flows generally southeast through the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest to Farmville. From Farmville it flows in a large arc northeast then southeast across the coastal plain, passing southwest of Richmond and passing through the Lake Chesdin reservoir. It flows through Petersburg, its head of navigation, through the Tri-cities area, then joins the James River from the west at City Point in Hopewell.

==History==
The English colonists in Virginia at first tried to rename the Appomattox as the &quot;Bristoll River&quot;, however this name did not catch on, while the native one did. There are numerous historical spelling variants, such as Apamatuck, Apamutiky, Appamattuck, Appomattake, and Apumetecs, among others.

The Appomattox River was cleared for transportation from Farmville to Petersburg for batteaux from 1745 to 1890 as the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System. Eppington Plantation had docks for larger boats that could carry seven tons to Petersburg in a four-day round trip. Petersburg had a port below the Fall Line that could hold ships which carry 200 tons down river to the Atlantic Ocean. Port Walthall, six miles downstream could hold larger ships and at City Point, where the Appomattox ran into the James River, even larger ships could dock in the 19th century.

In April 1865 during the Appomattox campaign of the American Civil War, the Confederate forces attempted to burn the High Bridge over the river northwest of Burkeville in order to escape the pursuing Union Army after the fall of Petersburg. The Union capture of the bridge was a contributing factor in the forcing of General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at nearby Appomattox Court House, ending the war in Virginia.

==Recreation==
The river is a popular destination for rafting and canoeing, particularly downstream of the small Abutment Dam (which is a couple miles down stream of Chesdin Dam) in the village of Matoaca to Petersburg near Virginia State University.

<doc id="720630" wikidata="Q3829938" url="?curid=720630" title="Self-defence in international law">
<text>International law recognizes a right of self-defense according to the Chapter VII, Article 51 of the UN Charter, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed in the &quot;Nicaragua Case&quot; on the use of force. Some commentators believe that the effect of Article 51 is only to preserve this right when an armed attack occurs, and that other acts of self-defence are banned by article 2(4). Another view is that Article 51 acknowledges the previously existing customary international law right and then proceeds to lay down procedures for the specific situation when an armed attack does occur. Under the latter interpretation, the legitimate use of self-defence in situations when an armed attack has not actually occurred is still permitted, as in the &quot;Caroline&quot; case noted below. Not every act of violence will constitute an armed attack. The ICJ has tried to clarify, in &quot;Nicaragua Case&quot;, what level of force is necessary to qualify as an armed attack.

==Article 51 of the UN Charter==
==Article 2(4) of the UN Charter==

The drafters’ intent was that collective force approved and organized by the Security Council would substitute for unilateral uses of force by states. However, some states were concerned that use of the veto power by one of the Council&#x27;s permanent members might prevent that body from taking necessary action, and they insisted upon inserting into the Charter an explicit right of self defense.

==Customary international law and &quot;Caroline&quot; test==

The traditional customary rules on preemptive self-defense derive from an early diplomatic incident between the United States and the United Kingdom over the killing of two US citizens who were on board a ship (the &quot;Caroline&quot;), which was docked in the U.S. but which had been carrying personnel and stores of war to rebels in Canada, then a British colony. The U.S. government had not approved or supported the &quot;Caroline&#x27;s&quot; activities and the ship was peacefully at anchor in the U.S. when British forces attacked, burned the ship and sent it over Niagara Falls. The so-called &quot;Caroline&quot; case established that in order for one state to use force in the territory of another state which had not used force first there had to exist &quot;a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation,&#x27; and furthermore that any action taken must be proportional, &quot;since the act justified by the necessity of self-defence, must be limited by that necessity, and kept clearly within it.&quot; These statements by the US Secretary of State to the British authorities are accepted as an accurate description of the customary right of preemptive, or anticipatory, self-defense. They are sometimes mistakenly said to apply to all uses of force by states in self-defense.

==Imminent threat==
As noted above, imminent threat is a standard criterion in international law, developed by Daniel Webster as he litigated the Caroline affair. The threat must be &quot;instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation&quot;&quot;. These criteria are used in the international law justification of &quot;preemptive self-defense&quot;: self-defense without being physically attacked first (see &quot;Caroline&quot; test). This concept has been used to mitigate the lack of definition provided by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which states that sovereign nations may fend off an &quot;armed attack&quot; until the Security Council has adopted measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

The &quot;Caroline&quot; affair has been used to establish the principle of &quot;anticipatory self-defense&quot; and is also now invoked frequently in the course of the dispute around preemptive strike (or preemption doctrine).

==Historical==
Hugo Grotius, the 17th-century jurist and father of public international law, stated in his 1625 magnum opus &quot;The Law of War and Peace&quot; that &quot;Most Men assign three Just Causes of War, Defence, the Recovery of what&#x27;s our own, and Punishment.&quot;

<doc id="720662" wikidata="Q245347" url="?curid=720662" title="India Gate">
<text>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the &quot;ceremonial axis&quot; of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen&#x27;s names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India&#x27;s tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the Gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society protests, and is popular with tourists.

== History ==

The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission, which came into existence in December 1917 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First World War. The foundation stone of the Gate, then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30 hrs, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by officers and men of the Imperial Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the Commander-in-Chief, and Lord Chelmsford, the Viceroy. On the occasion, the Viceroy is reported to have said, &quot;The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live forever in the annals of this country&quot;, and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, &quot;known and unknown&quot;, would inspire future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and &quot;no less valor&quot;. The Duke also read out a message from the King, which said, &quot;On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep&quot;, in the thoughts of future generations, &quot;the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men of the Indian Army who fought and fell&quot;. During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles. The land was owned by contractor Sir Sobha Singh who helped construct large tracts of New Delhi and was the primary contractor. 
Ten years after the foundation stone&#x27;s laying on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord Irwin, who, on the occasion, said &quot;those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record.&quot; In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run along the Yamuna River, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.

The Gate, which is illuminated every evening from 19:00 hrs to 21:30 hrs, today serves as one of Delhi&#x27;s most important tourist attractions. Cars used to travel through the gate until it was closed to traffic. The Republic Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the India Gate. India gate is often a location for civil society protests, including demonstrations in response to the 2011 anti-corruption movement.

In 2017, the India Gate was twinned with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, England, another Lutyens war memorial, following a very similar design but on a smaller scale. In a ceremony, India&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British High Commissioner to India laid one at the India Gate.

== Design and structure ==

The memorial gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New Delhi but also a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of Europe&#x27;s foremost designers of war graves and memorials. He designed sixty-six war memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded Cenotaph in London in 1919, the first national war memorial erected after World War I, for which he was commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History Teacher /9 April&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial in New Delhi, like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious and &quot;culturally-specific iconography such as crosses&quot;. Lutyens according to his biographer, Christopher Hussey, relied on the &quot;elemental mode&quot;, a style of commemoration based on a &quot;universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation&quot;.
The India Gate, which has been called a &quot;creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe&quot; has a span of across the larger opening and lies on the eastern axial end of Kingsway, present-day Kartavya Path, the central vista and main ceremonial procession route in New Delhi. The India Gate stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge cornice moulding above a frieze with sunburst motifs. The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries, but this is rarely done. The memorial-gate hexagon complex, with a diameter of about , covers approximately in area.

The India Gate structure is oblong, with a large archway on each of the four faces, but the arches on the long sides are larger and higher. The arches on the shorter sides are blocked at the bottom, with doorways, but open higher up. Technically the four arches make the building a tetrapylon. There is a large ornament in stone above the blocked bottom of the arches on the shorter sides. Mouldings run around the building at the levels from which both sizes of arch rise, and the keystones of the arches protrude slightly. The top of the keystones on the short sides&#x27; arches touch the bottom of the moulding at the base level of the higher long sides&#x27; arches. The ceilings and undersides of the arches are decorated with well-spaced coffers.

=== Inscriptions ===
The cornice of the India Gate is inscribed with Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates MCMXIV (&#x27;1914&#x27;; on the left) and MCMXIX (&#x27;1919&#x27;; on the right). Below the word INDIA, in capital letters, is inscribed:
13,313 names are engraved out of which 12,357 are Indian. Access to read the names on the memorial is restricted, though they can be seen on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) website, which lists the names with their respective date of death, unit name, regiment, place on gate where name is inscribed, location, and other information).

== Canopy ==
About east of the gate, at a junction of six roads, is a cupola, inspired by a sixth-century pavilion from Mahabalipuram. Lutyens used four Delhi Order columns to support the domed canopy and its &quot;chhajja&quot;.

=== Statue of King-Emperor George V ===

In the autumn of 1930, Jagatjit Singh, the Maharaja of Kapurthala State, organized an appeal amongst the Indian princely rulers to erect a statue of King-Emperor George V in New Delhi to commemorate the sovereign&#x27;s recent recovery from sepsis. As originally conceived, the statue would have depicted the monarch in marble riding in a howdah atop a red stone elephant; a canopy was not then included in the design. The final concept, approved by George V before his death, dispensed with the elephant, instead incorporating a red stone canopy and pedestal, with the pedestal standing tall. An tall marble statue of the King-Emperor wearing his Delhi Durbar coronation robes and Imperial State Crown, bearing the British globus cruciger and sceptre, was placed atop the pedestal, which bore the Royal Coat of Arms and the inscription GEORGE V R I, the &quot;R I&quot; designating him as &#x27;Rex Imperator&#x27; or &#x27;King Emperor&#x27;.

The combined height of the statue and pedestal was ; while the pedestal and canopy were designed by Lutyens, the statue was designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger of the Royal Academy of Arts. The canopy was topped by a gilded Tudor Crown and bore the Royal Cyphers of George V, with the completed monument intended to &quot;mark the loyalty and attachment of the Ruling Princes and Chiefs of India to the Person and Throne of the King-Emperor.&quot; Following the premature death of Jagger, the statue&#x27;s head and crown were completed by one of his assistants in England and then shipped to India, while the remainder of the monument was carved in India.

The statue&#x27;s installation in the autumn of 1936, amidst the Indian independence movement, made it a target for Independence activists; on the night of 3 January 1943, during the Quit India movement, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna and Manubhai Shah scaled the statue, smashed its nose and draped it with a large black cloth inscribed &quot;Death to the Tyrant.&quot; The statue remained standing at its original site for two decades following the nation&#x27;s independence in 1947, but certain political factions increasingly objected to its continued presence in its central location, particularly after the tenth anniversary of Independence and the centennial of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. On the night of 12–13 August 1958, the royal insignia of George V and the Tudor Crown atop the canopy were removed.

With increasing pressure from Socialist members of Parliament, then-Deputy Minister Home Affairs Lalit Narayan Mishra stated in May 1964 that all British statuary would be removed from the national capital by 1966. Two days before Independence Day in 1965, members of the Samyukta Socialist Party overpowered two constables guarding the site, covered the statue in tar and defaced its imperial crown, nose and one ear, also leaving a photo of Subhas Chandra Bose at the monument. Despite the resulting adverse publicity and the growing controversy over the situation, the matter of relocating the statue dragged on for several years. The British government rejected a proposal to repatriate the monument to the United Kingdom, citing the lack of an appropriate site and sufficient funds, while the British High Commission in New Delhi declined to have the statue relocated to their compound, due to limited space. Efforts to move the statue to a Delhi park were strongly opposed by the nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which then held power in the city. Finally, in late 1968, the statue was removed from its position beneath the canopy and briefly placed in storage before being moved to Delhi&#x27;s Coronation Park, where it joined other British Raj-era statues.

During and after the statue&#x27;s removal, it was often suggested that a statue of Mahatma Gandhi be placed under the canopy. The suggestion was even discussed in the Indian Parliament. In 1981, the government had in response to a question in the Parliament, confirmed that it was considering the installation of a Gandhi statue under the empty canopy, but nothing came of it.

=== Subhas Chandra Bose statue ===
On 21 January 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that a statue of Subhas Chandra Bose would be installed in the canopy at India Gate. The announcement came two days before the 125th anniversary of his birth. A 28 feet high and 6 feet wide 3D holographic statue of Bose was inaugurated at the site on 23 January 2022, celebrated as Parakram Diwas (Courage Day). On this occasion, an award in the name of Bose was instituted for the exemplary work in disaster management. On 8 September 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the newly made statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose near the India Gate.

== Amar Jawan Jyoti ==
Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier, is a structure consisting of black marble plinth, with reversed rifle, capped by war helmet, bound by four urns, each with the permanent light (&quot;jyoti&quot;) from compressed natural gas flames, erected under the India gate to commemorate Indian soldiers martyred in the war of the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 26 January 1972, the twenty-third Indian Republic Day.

Since the installation of the Amar Jawan Jyoti, it has served as India&#x27;s tomb of the unknown soldier. It is staffed around the clock by the Indian armed forces. Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti every Republic Day, Vijay Diwas, and Infantry Day by the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of the Armed Forces.

On 21 January 2022 the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate was merged with the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.

== National War Memorial ==
In July 2014, the government announced plans to construct a National War Memorial in the C-Hexagon (India Gate Circle), and an adjoining National War Museum. The cabinet allocated for the project. The National War Memorial was completed in January, 2019. Since January 2022, it houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the &quot;Flame of the Immortal Soldier&quot;.

<doc id="720672" wikidata="Q2005440" url="?curid=720672" title="Alias (Mac OS)">
<text>In classic Mac OS System 7 and later, and in macOS, an alias is a small file that represents another object in a local, remote, or removable file system and provides a dynamic link to it; the target object may be moved or renamed, and the alias will still link to it (unless the original file is recreated; such an alias is ambiguous and how it is resolved depends on the version of macOS). In Windows, a &quot;shortcut&quot;, a file with a .lnk extension, performs a similar function.

It is similar to the Unix symbolic link, but with the distinction of working even if the target file moves to another location on the same disk (in this case it acts like a hard link, but the source and target of the link may be on different filesystems, and the target of the link may be a directory). As a descendant of BSD, macOS supports Unix symbolic (and hard) links as well.

== Function ==

An alias acts as a stand-in for any object in the file system, such as a document, an application, a folder, a hard disk, a network share or removable medium or a printer. When double-clicked, the computer will act the same way as if the original file had been double-clicked. Likewise, choosing an alias file from within a &#x27;File Open&#x27; dialog box would open the original file. The purpose of an alias is to assist the user in managing large numbers of files by providing alternative ways to access them without having to copy the files themselves. While a typical alias under the classic Mac OS was small, between 1 and 5 KB, under macOS it can be fairly large, more than 5 MB (5000 KB) for the alias to a folder.

== Preventing alias failure ==

An alias is a dynamic reference to an object. The original may be moved to another place &quot;within the same filesystem&quot;, without breaking the link. The operating system stores several pieces of information about the original in the resource fork of the alias file. Examples of the information used to locate the original are:
* path
* file ID (inode number)
* directory ID (inode number)
* name
* file size

Since any of these properties can change without the computer&#x27;s knowledge, as a result of user activity, various search algorithms are used to find the most plausible target. This fault-tolerance sets the alias apart from similar functions in some other operating systems, such as the Unix symbolic link or the Microsoft Windows shortcut, at the expense of increased complexity and unpredictability. For example, an application can be moved from one directory to another within the same filesystem, but an existing alias would still launch the same application when double-clicked.

The question can arise of how an alias should work if a file is moved, and then a file is created with the same name as the original moved file, since the alias can be used to locate both the original name and the new location of the original file. With symbolic links the reference is unambiguous (soft links refer to the new file, hard links to the original). Before Mac OS X 10.2, however, such an ambiguous alias would consistently find the original moved file, rather than the recreated file. In Mac OS X 10.2 and later releases, the new file is found, matching the behaviour of symbolic links . macOS applications can programmatically use the old behavior if required.

Aliases are similar in operation to shadows in the graphical Workplace Shell of the OS/2 operating system.

== Distinguishing marks ==
In System 7 through Mac OS 9, aliases distinguished themselves visually to the user by the fact that their file names were in italics. To accommodate languages that don&#x27;t have italics (such as Japanese), in Mac OS 8.5 another distinguishing mark was added, badging with an &quot;alias arrow&quot;—a black arrow with a small white border—similar to that used for shortcuts in Microsoft Windows.

In macOS, the filenames of aliases are not italicized, but the arrow badge remains.

== File structure ==

The alias files in macOS start by the magic number codice_1 which is in ASCII codice_2 (␀ representing the Null character).

Following the magic number, it has been reported that an alias has a set of records inside it, each record is 150 bytes long and consists of the fields shown below (all integers are big endian). However, alias files are far larger than this would explain, and include other information at least including icons.

# 4 bytes user type name/app creator code = long ASCII text string (none = 0)
# 2 bytes record size = short unsigned total length
# 2 bytes record version = short integer version (current version = 2)
# 2 bytes alias kind = short integer value (file = 0; directory = 1)
# 1 byte volume name string length = byte unsigned length
# 27 bytes volume name string (if volume name string &lt; 27 chars then pad with zeros)
# 4 bytes volume created mac date = long unsigned value in seconds since beginning 1904 to 2040
# 2 bytes volume signature = short unsigned HFS value
# 2 bytes volume type = short integer mac os value (types are Fixed HD = 0; Network Disk = 1; 400kB FD = 2;800kB FD = 3; 1.4MB FD = 4; Other Ejectable Media = 5 )
# 4 bytes parent directory id = long unsigned HFS value
# 1 bytes file name string length = byte unsigned length
# 63 bytes file name string (if file name string &lt; 63 chars then pad with zeros)
# 4 bytes file number = long unsigned HFS value
# 4 bytes file created mac date = long unsigned value in seconds since beginning 1904 to 2040
# 4 bytes file type name = long ASCII text string
# 4 bytes file creator name = long ASCII text string
# 2 bytes nlvl From (directories from alias thru to root) = short integer range
# 2 bytes nlvl To (directories from root thru to source) = short integer range (if alias on different volume then set above to -1)
# 4 bytes volume attributes = long hex flags

==Managing aliases==

=== User interface ===
In System 7, the only way to create an alias was to select the original and choose &quot;Make Alias&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu. An alias, with the same name and &quot; alias&quot; appended would then be created in the same folder. In later versions, it became possible to create aliases by drag-and-drop, while holding down the command and option modifier keys.

Mac OS 8.5 added a feature for re-connecting aliases that had been broken for one reason or another (when the simple search algorithms failed to find a reliable replacement). This was done by selecting a new target through the standard Open File dialog.

In Mac OS 8.5 options were added for command-option dragging an object in the Finder to create an alias at that location. This is where the &quot;alias cursor&quot; was added to the system. The cursor mirrors the appearance of the &quot;create shortcut&quot; cursor on Windows systems.

=== Programming API ===
The Alias Manager API is part of Carbon that allows developers to create aliases and access the aliased file.

Mac OS X 10.6 introduced the Bookmarks API to Cocoa as a set of methods on and functions for . In Mac OS X 10.7.3, the API was enhanced for the App Sandbox with security-scoped bookmarks, which add security permissions to aliases on a per-application or per-document basis.

In Mac OS X 10.8 the Alias Manager API was officially deprecated in favor of the Bookmarks API.

==Relation to BSD symbolic and hard links==

Unix and similar operating systems provide 2 features very similar to macOS aliases: symbolic links and hard links. 
When using the macOS Finder, links are displayed and treated largely like macOS aliases, and even carry an identical &quot;Kind&quot; attribute. 
However, when using the shell command line, macOS aliases are not recognized: for example, you cannot use the &quot;cd&quot; command with the name of an alias file. This is because an alias is implemented as a file on the disk that must be interpreted by an API while links are implemented within the filesystem and are thus functional at any level of the OS. 

There is currently no pre-installed command to resolve an alias to the path of the file or directory it refers to. However, a freely available C program makes use of the Mac Carbon APIs to perform this task. Given that, commands such as &quot;cd&quot; can be set up to check for aliases and treat them just like symbolic or hard links.

<doc id="720677" wikidata="Q842082" url="?curid=720677" title="White Base">
<text>The SCV-70 &quot;White Base&quot; (ホワイトベース　&quot;Howaito Bēsu&quot;), also nicknamed Trojan Horse (木馬 &quot;Mokuba&quot;), is a fictional spaceship from the Japanese science fiction anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. It serves as the mothership of the protagonist Earth Federation crew members and the famous RX-78-2 Gundam mobile suit. Various spin-offs are designed after it, including a whole class of ships called the &quot;Pegasus-class&quot; assault carrier, and it has inspired ships in the sequels like the &quot;Argama-class&quot; in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; and &quot;Archangel-class&quot; in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;.

Other non-&quot;Gundam&quot; spaceships, such as the transformed mode of Fortress Maximus from the &quot;Transformers&quot; series, are possibly also inspired by &quot;White Base&quot;&#x27;s design.

== Development ==
The &quot;White Base&quot; is designed with a three-plane view method by Kunio Okawara, which originated as a salvaged design from the anime &quot;Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3&quot;. The idea of having a space carrier from the director Yoshiyuki Tomino was partly inspired by the earlier science fiction anime &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, which he claimed to be a fan of. It was intended to be in a more realistic black colour, but was changed to white by the order of Sunrise, similar to the colour change of the main mecha Gundam from grey to white, red, blue and yellow. Tomino showed great disgust in the colour change, also noticing the unrealistic non-aerodynamic design of it after the show was on air, said in an interview that such a design would never appear in the real world, since it would be a sitting duck from fighter aircraft. Tomino still held a grudge 10 years after the show aired and stated in an interview in &quot;Newtype&quot; 1989 April issue that the imaginary enemies of Gundam are Sunrise, sponsors and television stations. This ship also appeared in the Kodansha Pocket Encyclopedia series, listed as spacecraft carrier (Uchuu Kubou, 宇宙空母). The &quot;Zukai Uchusen&quot; magazine listed it the 6th most recognisable fictional spaceship (and 3rd in anime) after the Imperial Star Destroyer, Millennium Falcon, Enterprise, SDF-1 Macross, and Yamato, and the ship that made the Pegasus-class of ships famous.

==Special onboard systems==
As summarised for general readers, Chapter 4 of Zukai Uchusen, which is the chapter dedicated for famous fictional crafts, stated the White Base utilises Minovsky Physics to support a semi-antigravity system called &quot;Minovsky Craft&quot; to fly in the atmosphere, which it ejects Minovsky particles to create a kind of hovering effect.

== Fictional history ==
At the outbreak of the One Year War, the Dreadnought-oriented Earth Federation was caught completely by surprise when the Principality of Zeon deployed the agile mobile suits against their fleets. The Federation military quickly realised that they would also need mobile suits if they were to have any chance of victory, and instituted the famed Project V in order to develop a mass-production mobile suit design. The Federation also realised that their existing line of space warships — mostly the cannon-heavy &quot;Magellan-class&quot; battleships, &quot;Salamis-class&quot; cruisers, and the unarmed &quot;Columbus-class&quot; transporters — are severely lacking in mobile suit transport and support capacity, and thus desperately in need of designs capable of mobile warfare. A new revolutionary warship class exclusively designed for MS combat and support was born — the &quot;Pegasus-class&quot; assault carrier. One of the first &quot;Pegasus-class&quot; ships to enter active service was the &quot;White Base&quot;.

Launched in September UC 0079, &quot;White Base&quot; was immediately sent to retrieve the Federation&#x27;s new mobile suit prototypes from Side 7&#x27;s secret research facility for field testing. In the middle of this mission, she unexpectedly found herself tailed by a Zeon special combat unit led by Char Aznable. When the Zeon forces launched their surprise attack on the colony, heavy casualties were inflicted among the colony&#x27;s civilian population and &quot;White Base&quot;&#x27;s regular personnel. In the middle of the battle, civilian teenager Amuro Ray activated the RX-78-2 Gundam unit in sheer desperation and repulsed the Zeon attack, destroying two Zakus in the process. The surviving crew and the civilian refugees then boarded &quot;White Base&quot; and went on a long journey plagued by Zeon hostilities.

&quot;White Base&quot; first landed at Luna II, home of the remaining Earth Federation Space Force fleet, where she was promptly seized by the base commander, who proceeded to interrogate the crew, militia and civilian survivors on board. In the middle of this interrogation, Char, searching for &quot;White Base&quot;, led an infiltration attack on Luna II by mining the port entrance. &quot;White Base&quot; managed to escape from Luna II, and sailed next for Earth under the command of a hastily promoted young captain named Bright Noa.

Upon making contact with the Federation forces under the command of General Johann Abraham Revil, &quot;White Base&quot; was forced to push west through Zeon-controlled territory in North America and was drawn into a battle in the ruins of Seattle, where she shot down a Zeon &quot;Gaw-class&quot; carrier containing Zeon prince Garma Zabi (who was manoeuvred into an ambush by Char). &quot;White Base&quot; then crossed the Pacific Ocean to rendezvous with Revil&#x27;s forces that were assembling for a major operation in Eastern Europe. Along the trek through Central Asia, she was hunted by another Zeon special forces unit under the command of Ramba Ral. Eventually regrouping with the Federation forces, &quot;White Base&quot; participated in Operation Odessa, the bloodiest Earth battle of the entire One Year War, helping to obliterate the main foothold of the Zeon invasion forces on Earth. She then restocked and refueled in Belfast before traveling across the Atlantic Ocean.

After the long route around the world, &quot;White Base&quot; finally arrived and docked at Jaburo, the Federation&#x27;s main base and mobile suit manufacturing facility located underground in South America. Unfortunately, they ended up leading Char&#x27;s &quot;Mad Angler&quot; unit to Jaburo, at which point he attempted an infiltration, which was repelled.

Following the failed Zeon raid on Jaburo, &quot;White Base&quot; was re-designated the 13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron, and re-launched into space to Side 6 in a diversionary move aimed at drawing off Zeon forces from Solomon. This mission would solidify her fame as Zeon&#x27;s worst nightmare, as this single ship managed to surprise everyone by repeatedly knocking out heavyweight Zeon fleet commanders. Additionally, the unrivaled performance of Amuro Ray (including the widely televised Side 6 battle where he single-handedly shot down 9 Rick Doms within merely 3 minutes) earned the ship crew the nickname &quot;Newtype Corps&quot;. With much of Zeon&#x27;s attention being fixed on hunting down the &quot;Trojan Horse&quot;, the Federation gained crucial strategic time to complete the deployment of its new Vinson Plan space armada, together with their new mass-produced RGM-79 GM. After destroying the Conscon Fleet, &quot;White Base&quot; rendezvoused with the remaining ships in the Earth Federation Space Force, and participated in the Battles of Solomon and A Baoa Qu.

During the pitched battle at A Baoa Qu, the Zeon supreme leader Gihren Zabi unleashed the Solar Ray, a gigantic colony laser superweapon, which wiped out a third of the Federation fleet and killed General Revil. &quot;White Base&quot; became a rally point for the surviving ships from Revil&#x27;s fleet, and spearheaded the assault against A Baoa Qu&#x27;s 5 defensive lines. During the battle, she sustained critical damage and was forced to crash-land into a space port of the asteroid stronghold, and immediately became a hotspot for hostile assaults. The grounded &quot;White Base&quot; was eventually destroyed from intense enemy attacks, although her entire surviving crew evacuated in time.
