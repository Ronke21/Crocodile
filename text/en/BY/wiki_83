<text>Soap Opera Digest was a weekly magazine covering American daytime soap operas. It featured onscreen and offscreen news about the series, interviews with and articles about performers, storyline summaries and analysis, and related promotional information. Founded in 1975, the magazine historically included certain prime time soap operas in its coverage as well.

==History==
&quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; debuted in November 1975, co-founded by Angela Shapiro and Jerome Shapiro and founding Editor Ruth J Gordon and featuring actors John Aniston, Ron Tomme, Audrey Peters, Birgitta Tolksdorf, Jerry Lacy, and Tudi Wiggins of &quot;Love of Life&quot; on its first cover. In the early 1990s, the magazine had up to 1.4 million subscribers.

In 1980, Network Publishing Corporation purchased the magazine from Shapiro, who went on to found &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot;. Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation bought the magazine from Gerry M. Ritterman in 1989. Ritterman had owned &quot;Soap Opera Diges&quot;

for three years before selling it to Murdoch Magazines; Ritterman earned more than $50 million from his share of the $70 million purchase price. According to Ritterman, he&#x27;d purchased the magazine at 750,000 subscribers and sold it at 1.3 million. Murdoch sold Soap Opera Digest to K-III Communications in 1991. K-III was renamed Primedia in 1997, and sold its magazines to Source Interlink in 2007. American Media, Inc. began publishing &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in 2011.

&quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; originally published monthly, moved to triweekly issues in 1979, biweekly issues in 1980, and on April 1, 1997, started publishing weekly. The issue dates were on Tuesdays, but changed to Mondays beginning with the April 16, 2012 issue.

Meredith Brown Berlin was named executive editor (the magazine&#x27;s equivalent of editor-in-chief) in 1982 at the age of 26, making her the youngest editor of a national magazine at that time. Ritterman later promoted her to editor-in-chief and vice president. She stayed in that position until 1991. During her tenure, the magazine saw its greatest circulation growth. Berlin was followed by Lynn Leahey, who headed the magazine for 27 years. In June 2011, Stephanie Sloane replaced Leahey as the magazine&#x27;s editorial director.

The magazine used to hold an awards show annually to promote excellence in the genre, as decided by the fans who read the magazine. The &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards (formerly the &quot;Soapies&quot;) have been held every year since 1977, and were last televised in 2000. The Soapy Award was originally designed by Janis Rogak, the magazine&#x27;s then-Art Director. Berlin and Ritterman earned a handful of Daytime Emmy Award nominations, with Dick Clark Productions, for co executive producing the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards.

On October 27, 2023, it was announced a360media would cease production of the physical weekly publications. The magazine currently continues to update content on its website, and announced its intention to print &quot;special print issues&quot; at least four times per year.

==&quot;Soap speak&quot; acronyms==
&quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; coined the term and popularized the use of &quot;soap speak,&quot; in which show names are abbreviated as acronyms to save space. These abbreviations have come into more extensive use outside the magazine with the advent of internet chat rooms and message boards.

For example, current soap operas and their acronyms include &quot;General Hospital&quot; (&quot;GH&quot;), &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (&quot;B&amp;B&quot;), and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (&quot;Y&amp;R&quot;). &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; is referred to as &quot;DAYS&quot; in the magazine, though the acronym &quot;DOOL&quot; is sometimes used elsewhere; &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; was similarly designated &quot;SHIFT&quot; rather than under an acronym. Abbreviations used for now-defunct series include &quot;All My Children&quot; (&quot;AMC&quot;), &quot;Another World&quot; (&quot;AW&quot;), &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (&quot;ATWT&quot;), &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (&quot;EON&quot;), &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (&quot;GL&quot;), &quot;Love of Life&quot; (&quot;LOL&quot;), &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (&quot;OLTL&quot;), &quot;Port Charles&quot; (&quot;PC&quot;), &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (&quot;RH&quot;), and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (&quot;SFT&quot;). The now-defunct series &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; (1997–1999) was known as &quot;BEACH&quot; to differentiate it from the previously cancelled series &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; (1984–1993), which itself had been referred to as &quot;SB&quot;. Other past series with single-word titles (like &quot;Capitol&quot;, &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;Passions&quot;) had fully capitalized identifiers, while not typically abbreviating their titles in-reference. Prime time soap operas have also been attributed with acronyms and abbreviations in the magazine, including &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (&quot;90210&quot;), &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (&quot;MP&quot;) and &quot;Dynasty&quot; (&quot;DYN&quot;).

==Circulation==
&quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; circulation has declined over the years, reflecting both a decline in soap opera viewership and a decline in magazine circulations in general. A 40 percent decline in 2003 was due to eliminating reduced-rate subscriptions. This is a list of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; average circulation per issue, per year.

<doc id="717845" wikidata="Q4127184" url="?curid=717845" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency">
<text>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a mutation in the gene CYP17A1, which produces the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase. It causes decreased synthesis of cortisol and sex hormones, with resulting increase in mineralocorticoid production. Thus, common symptoms include mild cortisol deficiency, ambiguous genitalia in men or amenorrhea at puberty in women, and hypokalemic hypertension. However, partial (incomplete) deficiency often has inconsistent symptoms between patients, and affected women may be asymptomatic except for infertility.

==Pathophysiology==
This form of CAH results from deficiency of the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase (also called CYP17A1). It accounts for less than 5% of the cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with a reported incidence of about 1 in 1,000,000 births. 

The most common forms of this condition impair both the 17α-hydroxylase activity and the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1. Like other forms of CAH, 17α-hydroxylase deficiency impairs the efficiency of cortisol synthesis, resulting in high levels of ACTH secretion and hyperplasia of the adrenal glands. Clinical effects of this condition include overproduction of mineralocorticoids and deficiency of prenatal and pubertal sex hormones. 

CYP17A1 functions in steroidogenesis, where it converts pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy forms. The enzyme itself is attached to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex and gonads. CYP17A1 functions as both a 17α-hydroxylase and a 17,20-lyase. The dual activities mediate three key transformations in cortisol and sex hormone synthesis:
* As 17α-hydroxylase it mediates pregnenolone → 17α-hydroxypregnenolone
* and progesterone → 17α-hydroxyprogesterone.
* As 17,20-lyase it mediates 17α-hydroxypregnenolone → DHEA.
* An expected second 17,20-lyase reaction (17α-hydroxyprogesterone → androstenedione) is mediated so inefficiently in humans as to be of no known significance.

The hydroxylase reactions are part of the synthetic pathway to cortisol as well as sex hormones, but the lyase reaction is only necessary for sex hormone synthesis. Different alleles of the CYP17A1 gene result in enzyme molecules with a range of impaired or reduced function that produces a range of clinical problems.

The dual enzyme activities were for many decades assumed to represent two entirely different genes and enzymes. Thus, medical textbooks and diagnostic manuals formerly described two different diseases: &quot;17α-hydroxylase deficient CAH&quot;, and a distinct and more rare defect of sex steroid synthesis termed &quot;17,20-lyase deficiency&quot; (which is not a form of CAH). In the last decade it has become clearer that the two diseases are different forms of defects of the same gene. The clinical features of the two types of impairment are described separately in the following sections.

===Mineralocorticoid effects===
The adrenal cortex is hyperplastic and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some people with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% do so by late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clues distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex hormones. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.

===Glucocorticoid effects===
Although production of cortisol is too inefficient to normalize ACTH, the 50- to 100-fold elevations of corticosterone have enough weak glucocorticoid activity to prevent glucocorticoid deficiency and adrenal crisis.

===Sex hormone effects===
Genetic females affected by total 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with normal female primary sex characteristics. At the expected time of puberty neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex hormones, so neither breast development nor pubic hair appear. Testing yields elevated gonadotropins and normal karyotype, while imaging confirms the presence of ovaries and an underdeveloped uterus. Discovery of hypertension and hypokalemic alkalosis usually suggests the presence of one of the proximal forms of CAH, and the characteristic mineralocorticoid elevations confirm the specific diagnosis.

Milder forms of this deficiency in genetic females allow some degree of sexual development, with variable reproductive system dysregulation that can include incomplete Tanner scale development, retrograde sexual development, irregular menstruation, early menopause, or – in very mild cases – no physical symptoms beyond infertility.
Evidence suggests that only 5% of normal enzyme activity may be enough to allow at least the physical changes of female puberty, if not ovulation and fertility. In women with mild cases, elevated blood pressure and/or infertility is the presenting clinical problem.

17α-hydroxylase deficiency in genetic males results in moderate to severe reduction of fetal testosterone production by adrenal glands and testes. Undervirilization is variable and sometimes complete. The appearance of the external genitalia ranges from normal female to ambiguous to mildly underdeveloped male. The most commonly described phenotype is a small phallus, perineal hypospadias, small blind pseudovaginal pouch, and intra-abdominal or inguinal testes. Wolffian duct derivatives are hypoplastic or normal, depending on degree of testosterone deficiency. Some of those with partial virilization develop gynecomastia at puberty even though masculinization is reduced. The presence of hypertension in the majority distinguishes them from other forms of partial androgen deficiency or insensitivity. Fertility is impaired in those with more than minimal testosterone deficiency.

==17,20-lyase deficiency==

A very small number of people have reportedly had an abnormal allele that resulted primarily in a reduction of 17,20-lyase activity, rather than both the hydroxylase and lyase activities as described above. In these people the defect had the effect of an isolated impairment of sex steroid (e.g., DHEA in the adrenal, but also gonadal testosterone and estrogens) synthesis, whereas mineralocorticoid (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoid (e.g., cortisol) levels remain normal. 

Normal aldosterone level can be attributed to the fact that aldosterone is independent of hypothalamus-pituitary axis feedback system, being mainly controlled by the level of serum potassium. Because of the normal aldosterone level, hypertension is not expected.

Normal cortisol level can be explained by the strong negative feedback mechanism of cortisol on hypothalamus-pituitary axis system. That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more cortisol. However, the initial excess of cortisol is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism—high cortisol decreases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid overproduction. Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia.

It has also been observed in patients that the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level remains in the normal range. The reason for this is still unclear.

The sex steroid deficiency produces effects similar to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency. Severely affected genetic females (XX) are born with normal internal and external genitalia and there are no clues to abnormality until adolescence, when the androgenic and estrogenic signs (e.g., breasts and pubic hair) of puberty either fails to occur or is abnormal. Gonadotropins are high and the uterus infantile in size. The ovaries may contain enlarged follicular cysts, and ovulation may not occur even after replacement of estrogen. 

==Treatment==

Hypertension and mineralocorticoid excess is treated with glucocorticoid replacement, as in other forms of CAH.
Most genetic females with both forms of the deficiency will need replacement estrogen to induce puberty. Most will also need periodic progestin to regularize menses. Fertility is usually reduced because egg maturation and ovulation is poorly supported by the reduced intra-ovarian steroid production.
The most difficult management decisions are posed by the more ambiguous genetic (XY) males. Most who are severely undervirilized, looking more female than male, are raised as females with surgical removal of the nonfunctional testes. If raised as males, a brief course of testosterone can be given in infancy to induce growth of the penis. Surgery may be able to repair the hypospadias. The testes should be salvaged by orchiopexy if possible. Testosterone must be replaced in order for puberty to occur and continued throughout adult life.

<text>In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes called a lift spoiler or lift dumper) is a device which increases the drag and decreases the lift of an airfoil in a controlled way. Most often, spoilers are hinged plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to &quot;spoil&quot; the streamline flow. By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over the portion of the wing behind it, greatly reducing the lift of that wing section.

Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without disrupting the lift distribution across the wing span, while spoilers disrupt the lift distribution as well as increasing drag. However, flight spoilers are routinely referred to as &quot;speed brakes&quot; on transport aircraft by pilots and manufacturers, despite significantly reducing lift.

Spoilers fall into two categories: those that are deployed at controlled angles during flight to increase descent rate or control roll, and those that are fully deployed immediately on landing to greatly reduce lift (&quot;ground spoilers&quot; or &quot;lift dumpers&quot;) and increase drag. In modern fly-by-wire aircraft, the same set of control surfaces serve both functions.

Spoilers were used by most gliders (sailplanes) until the 1960s to control their rate of descent and thus achieve a controlled landing. Since then, spoilers on gliders have almost entirely been replaced by airbrakes, usually of the Schempp-Hirth type. Spoilers and airbrakes enable the glide angle to be altered during the approach while leaving the speed unchanged.

Airliners are commonly fitted with spoilers. Spoilers are used to increase descent rate without increasing speed. Spoilers may also be differentially operated for roll control as spoilerons in place of ailerons; Martin Aircraft was the first company to develop such spoilers in 1948. On landing the spoilers are usually fully deployed to help slow the aircraft: the increase in form drag created by the spoilers provides a braking effect. The spoilers also cause a significant loss of lift so that there is more weight acting on the landing gear, allowing more braking to be used without skidding.

In air-cooled piston engine aircraft, spoilers may be needed to avoid shock cooling the engines. In a descent without spoilers, air speed is increased and the engine will be at low power, producing less heat than normal. The engine may cool too rapidly, resulting in stuck valves, cracked cylinders or other problems. Spoilers alleviate the situation by allowing the aircraft to descend at a desired rate while letting the engine run at a power setting that keeps it from cooling too quickly (especially true for turbocharged piston engines, which generate higher temperatures than normally aspirated engines).

==Spoiler controls==
Spoiler controls can be used for roll control (outboard or mid-span spoilers) or descent control (inboard spoilers).

Some aircraft use spoilers in combination with or in lieu of ailerons for roll control, primarily to reduce adverse yaw when rudder input is limited by higher speeds. For such spoilers the term spoileron has been coined. In the case of a spoileron, in order for it to be used as a control surface, it is raised on one wing only, thus decreasing lift and increasing drag, causing roll and yaw. Eliminating dedicated ailerons also avoids the problem of control reversal and allows flaps to occupy a greater portion of the wing trailing edge.

Almost all modern jet airliners are fitted with inboard lift spoilers which are used together during descent to increase the rate of descent and control speed. Some aircraft use lift spoilers on landing approach to control descent without changing the aircraft&#x27;s attitude.

One jet airliner not fitted with lift spoilers was the Douglas DC-8 which used reverse thrust in flight on the two inboard engines to control descent speed (however the aircraft was fitted with lift dumpers). The Lockheed Tristar was fitted with a system called &quot;Direct Lift Control&quot; that used the spoilers on landing approach to control descent.

Airbus aircraft with fly-by-wire control utilise wide-span spoilers for descent control, spoilerons, gust alleviation, and lift dumpers. Especially on landing approach, the full width of spoilers can be seen controlling the aircraft&#x27;s descent rate and bank.

==Ground spoilers==
Ground spoilers, sometimes called lift dumpers informally, are a special type of spoiler designed to reduce wing lift on landing, differentiated from flight spoilers by having only two positions: deployed and retracted. They spoilers have three main functions: increasing the weight acting the landing gear for maximum braking effect, increasing form drag, and preventing aircraft &quot;bounce&quot; on landing.

Ground spoilers usually deploy automatically on touch down, with the flight spoilers also raised to increase the effect.

Virtually all modern jet aircraft are fitted with ground spoilers. The British Aerospace 146 is fitted with particularly wide-span spoilers to generate additional drag and make reverse thrust unnecessary.

A number of accidents have been caused either by inadvertently deploying ground spoilers on landing approach, or forgetting to set them to &quot;automatic&quot;.

==Incidents and accidents==
* Air Canada Flight 621 – Premature deployment of the spoilers at low altitude contributed to this crash in Toronto on 5 July 1970.
*United Airlines Flight 553 – Forgetting to deactivate the spoilers contributed to crash at Chicago Midway International Airport on 8 December 1972.
*Loftleiðir Icelandic Airlines Flight 509  – Deployment of lift dumpers while attempting to arm them 40 feet above the runway caused this accident at John F. Kennedy International Airport on 23 June 1973.
*American Airlines Flight 965 – Forgetting to deactivate the spoilers while climbing to avoid a mountain contributed to this crash on 20 December 1995.
*American Airlines Flight 1420 – Forgetting to deploy the spoilers contributed to this crash at Little Rock National Airport on 1 June 1999.
*Atlantic Airways Flight 670 – The spoilers did not deploy during landing on a fairly short wet runway, causing overrun and falling over a cliff, on 10 October 2006.
*TAM Airlines Flight 3054 – This Airbus A320&#x27;s pilots were aware of their deactivated starboard engine #2 thrust reverser, and so apparently did not attempt to use it to brake when attempting to land at São Paulo&#x27;s Congonhas Airport on 17 July 2007; under one theory of the cause, they used an old procedure, which reduced the required runway length for landing but was superseded because it invited pilot error, which required them to leave the engine in idle rather than reverse thrust, and mistakenly left the engine at full power. The plane&#x27;s spoilers may have been their only method of braking at speed. The plane slid off the runway, over a major highway, and ploughed into a warehouse, killing all 186 on board as well as several on the ground. It was Brazil&#x27;s worst aviation disaster.
*2023 Elmina Beechcraft 390 crash – Inadvertent deployment of spoilers of a Beechcraft 390 Premier I business jet while attempting to arm them before landing, resulting in a sudden loss of lift and subsequent crash in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia, on 17 August 2023.

<doc id="717853" wikidata="Q6154249" url="?curid=717853" title="Janice Hart">
<text>Janice Hart (born 1955) is an American former politician who was an unsuccessful candidate for the office of Illinois Secretary of State in 1986.

Hart, a political unknown and a LaRouche movement activist since the age of 17, unexpectedly won the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination. Her opponent, Aurelia Pucinski, came from a politically prominent family and was supported by the party organization. On March 19, 1986, Hart celebrated her victory of the previous day, saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to revive the spirit of Abraham Lincoln and General Patton. We&#x27;re going to roll our tanks down State Street.&quot;

Prominent Democrats nationwide opposed Hart&#x27;s candidacy, with Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk saying &quot;Good Lord, we have a problem here.&quot; Democratic gubernatorial candidate Adlai Stevenson III refused to run on the same slate with Hart and the LaRouche-supported candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Mark J. Fairchild. He described Hart, who is Jewish, and Fairchild as &quot;neo-Nazis... who preach anti-Semitism, who cavort with the Ku Klux Klan, and who want to destroy labour unions.&quot; Instead, Stevenson formed the Solidarity Party and ran with Jane Spirgel as the Secretary of State nominee. Hart achieved 15% of the vote, with Spirgel taking 17%. Hart and Spirgel&#x27;s opponent, Republican incumbent Jim Edgar, won the election by the largest margin in any statewide election in Illinois history, with 1.574 million votes (67%). Following the election Hart defiantly said, &quot;Victory is not defined by your petty election.&quot;

Hart appeared in the news again in the summer of 1986 when she threw a pound of raw liver, as a symbolic &quot;pound of flesh&quot;, at the feet of Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland, to protest what she perceived as his support for the International Monetary Fund. After initially failing to appear to answer the charges, she was fined $500 for disorderly conduct.

Hart opposed Pucinski again in 1988, this time for the Democratic nomination for Clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court, which Pucinski won. When Hart applied for the nomination for Secretary of State again in 1990 she did not qualify due to insufficient signatures on her petition. She subsequently retired from public life. In 2007, one-time ticketmate Fairchild told a reporter that Hart was no longer with the LaRouche movement.

==Political significance==
Hart ran on the LaRouche platform, including measures to classify AIDS as a communicable disease &quot;and give health officials the power to test and quarantine
where needed,&quot; investigation of supposed drug smuggling cartels protected by Henry Kissinger and Katharine Graham, and strong support for the Strategic Defense Initiative and nuclear power. Ever since the 1986 election the Hart candidacy has been discussed and studied by academics, and journalists. Some blame Stevenson for his inept campaigning for the ticket and voters for their apathy. Dennis King in &quot;Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism&quot; (1989) cites evidence that some of Hart&#x27;s support resulted from below-the-radar organizing and campaigning in farm communities and rust belt towns.

<text>Living Legends is an American hip hop supergroup consisting of indie hip hop artists from California. Beginning in the mid 1990s, the crew garnered a following by recording, promoting and performing their music independently through Legendary Music.

The crew is considered by &quot;LA Weekly&quot; to be &quot;one of the biggest success stories of the indie-rap movement, having sold millions of units collectively — all by them-damn-selves.&quot;

==History==
Living Legends originally grew out of Mystik Journeymen, consisted of BFAP (now known as Sunspot Jonz) and PSC (now known as Luckyiam). Beginning in 1994, the Mystik Journeymen began cultivating a fan base by selling their own tapes on the streets and hosting &quot;Underground Survivors&quot; shows in East Oakland. In 1995, the duo met The Grouch. They soon embarked on the first of several of self-funded tours throughout Europe. In 1996, Mystik Journeymen and The Grouch joined with the trio known as 3 Melancholy Gypsys (Eligh, Scarub, and Murs) of Los Angeles. They formed Living Legends in late 1990s. The crew has since grown to include Bicasso, Aesop and Arata.

The group and its members have founded and operated several imprints, including Outhouse Records and Revenge Entertainment. In 1999, Living Legends moved their base of operations to Los Angeles.

In May 2012, Murs quit the group. In June that year, The Grouch announced hiatus from the group.

In 2016, the group (Aesop, Bicasso, Eligh, Luckyiam, Murs, Scarub, Sunspot Jonz, and The Grouch) officially reunited for a regional tour and hit the road as part of the 10th annual How The Grouch Stole Christmas Tour.

<text>Te Urewera National Park was a national park near the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, established as such in 1954 and disestablished in 2014, when it was replaced by a new legal entity and protected area named &quot;Te Urewera&quot;. The park covered an area of approximately 2,127 km2 and was located in the north of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of the North Island. It was the largest of four national parks in the North Island and the most isolated rainforest in the region.

==History==
Owing to its geographical isolation, the region was one of the last to be claimed by the British during colonisation in the 19th century.

On 28 July 1954, the catchment areas of Lake Waikaremoana and Lake Waikareiti and other Crown reserves were gazetted as a national park, and by 1957 proposals were well under way to add the rest of the Crown land in Te Urewera north of Ruatāhuna. This proposal was formalised in November 1957, when an additional 1,350 km2 were added. Further additions were made in 1962, 1975, and 1979, with smaller acquisitions of land and boundary alterations in the intervening period. The lake bed and Māori enclaves were not included in the gazetting of the park. The Crown had leased the lake bed, which was managed by the Department of Conservation.

In March 2013, the Tūhoe people signed a deed of settlement, settling the tribe&#x27;s claims under the Waitangi Tribunal. Under the deal, the Tūhoe were to receive NZ$170 million and also be given more control over Te Urewera. It ceased to be a national park under the Te Urewera Act 2014, becoming Te Urewera, the first natural resource in the world to be awarded the same legal rights as a person.

==Name==
Te Urewera is the traditional home of the Tūhoe people. The name means &quot;burnt penis&quot; in the Māori language and reflects a local legend.

<doc id="717883" wikidata="Q5882536" url="?curid=717883" title="Hollywood, Worcestershire">
<text>Hollywood is a large village predominantly located in the Bromsgrove district of Worcestershire, England, almost contiguous with and to the south of the city of Birmingham. Hollywood was formerly part of Kings Norton, but when Birmingham expanded in 1911, Hollywood remained in Worcestershire. The village now lies across the wards of Hollywood, most of Drakes Cross, the Trueman&#x27;s Heath polling district area of Trueman&#x27;s Heath parish ward and, following a 1966 border change, the southern portion of the Birmingham Highter&#x27;s Heath ward, with all but the latter being located within the civil parish of Wythall. The southern part of the village is also known as Drakes Cross, whilst the eastern part is sometimes referred to as Trueman&#x27;s Heath. Hollywood is situated in the extreme northeastern corner of Worcestershire, 8.5mi/13km south of Birmingham city centre, 6mi/9.5km west of Solihull and 8mi/12.5km northeast of Redditch.

==History==
Until the 1950s, Hollywood was a rural area with many fields and farms. Extensive postwar development saw these fields and farms give way to housing estates, shops and schools. The majority of the development that took place was non-contiguous with the Birmingham conurbation: Hollywood Golf Course in particular ensured a break existed, as well as the retention of open fields directly south of the Maypole. However, in 1966, the city boundary moved from Maypole Lane to incorporate the latest contiguous developments on and directly off Maypole Lane, Alcester Road South and Highters Heath Lane, including the at the time soon to be built Hollywood Primary School. The naming of the school has primarily contributed to this part of Birmingham&#x27;s Highter&#x27;s Heath ward continuing to be associated with Hollywood.

==Geography==
Hollywood is served by the Alcester Road, although the A435 road itself which formerly ran through the village now bypasses it, and is adjacent to Highter&#x27;s Heath to the north and Wythall to the south. Other settlements close by include Kings Heath, Kings Norton, Shirley, Maypole, Tidbury Green, Earlswood, Major&#x27;s Green, Whitlocks End and Dickens Heath.

==Amenities==

Hollywood is home to the 18-hole Hollywood Golf Club, formerly known as Gay Hill Golf Club since 1913, a family owned and managed packaging company, Kilby Packaging, which has existed since 1946, and a timber and hardware supplier, Davies Timber, established over 100 years ago. Most of the village&#x27;s community buildings are centred around Woodrush High School and the adjacent Coppice Primary School on Shawhurst Lane. These include the Woodrush Sports Centre, Community Hub and Wythall (parish) Library, whilst St Mary&#x27;s CoE Church, originally located on Chapel Lane in Wythall, now occupies a new building adjoining the Coppice School. Hollywood Primary School is located just over the county border within the Highter&#x27;s Heath ward of the city of Birmingham, and Meadow Green Primary School to the south, in Wythall village, on Meadow Lane. The Packhorse public house is located on Packhorse Lane, at the junction with Alcester Road, and The White Swan public house on Alcester Road, at the junction with Houndsfield Lane. 

==Transport==
Hollywood is served by multiple bus routes. Diamond run the 150 (between Redditch and Kings Heath), and the 502 (a school service between Kings Heath and Alcester Academy), and LandFlight run the A4 (between Wythall (Inkford Brook) and Solihull). The village is served by two railway stations, being in close proximity to Wythall station and Whitlocks End station, providing half-hourly and hourly trains to Stratford-Upon-Avon, Birmingham, Kidderminster, and Worcester.

==Notable residents==
*Steve Ashley, former motor racing champion (Class 4 Kart, Formula Ford, F3).
*Alan Dedicoat, former presenter at BBC Radio WM and now &#x27;Voice of the Balls&#x27; on &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot;, born in the village.

<text>The real presence of Christ in the Eucharist is the Christian doctrine that Jesus Christ is present in the Eucharist, not merely symbolically or metaphorically, but in a true, real and substantial way.

There are a number of Christian denominations that teach that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist, including Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, the Moravian Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Methodism, and Reformed Christianity. The differences in the teachings of these Churches primarily concern &quot;the mode of Christ&#x27;s presence in the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;. 

Efforts at mutual understanding of the range of beliefs by these Churches led in the 1980s to consultations on &quot;Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry&quot; by the World Council of Churches.

The Real Presence is rejected or interpreted in light of &quot;remembrance&quot; (per certain translations of the New Testament) by other Christians, including General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, some non-denominational Christian churches, as well as those identifying with liberal Christianity, segments of the Restoration Movement, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

==History==
The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist has been believed since very ancient times. Early Christian writers referred to the Eucharistic elements as Jesus&#x27;s body and the blood.

The short document known as the &quot;Teachings of the Apostles&quot; or &quot;Didache&quot;, which may be the earliest Christian document outside of the New Testament to speak of the Eucharist, says, &quot;Let no one eat or drink of your Eucharist, unless they have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, &#x27;Give not that which is holy to the dogs&#x27;.&quot;
Ignatius of Antioch, writing in about AD 106 to the Roman Christians, says: &quot;I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely his blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.&quot;

Writing to the Christians of Smyrna in the same year, he warned them to &quot;stand aloof from such heretics&quot;, because, among other reasons, &quot;they abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of his goodness, raised up again.&quot;

In about 150, Justin Martyr, referring to the Eucharist, wrote in his First Apology: &quot;Not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of his word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.&quot;

In about AD 200, Tertullian wrote: &quot;Having taken the bread and given it to his disciples, He made it his own body, by saying, This is my body, that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body. An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say) He pretended the bread was his body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us.&quot;

The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; (compiled ) says: &quot;Let the bishop give the oblation, saying, The body of Christ; and let him that receiveth say, Amen. And let the deacon take the cup; and when he gives it, say, The blood of Christ, the cup of life; and let him that drinketh say, Amen.&quot;

Ambrose of Milan (died 397) wrote:
Other fourth-century Christian writers say that in the Eucharist there occurs a &quot;change&quot;, &quot;transelementation&quot;, &quot;transformation&quot;, &quot;transposing&quot;, &quot;alteration&quot; of the bread into the body of Christ.

Augustine declares that the bread consecrated in the Eucharist actually &quot;becomes&quot; (in Latin, ) the Body of Christ: &quot;The faithful know what I&#x27;m talking about; they know Christ in the breaking of bread. It isn&#x27;t every loaf of bread, you see, but the one receiving Christ&#x27;s blessing, that becomes the body of Christ.&quot;

In the 9th century, Charles the Bald posed two unclearly formulated questions: whether the faithful receive the body of Christ in mystery or in truth and whether the body is the same that was born of Mary and suffered on the cross. Ratramnus understood &quot;in truth&quot; to mean simply &quot;what is perceptible to the senses&quot;, &quot;plain unvarnished reality&quot; (), and declared that the consecration leaves the bread and wine unchanged in their outward appearance and thus, insofar as these are signs of the body and blood of Christ hidden under the veil of the signs, the faithful receive the body of Christ not , but (figure, mystery, power). Ratramnus opposed Capharnaitic tendencies but in no way betrayed a symbolist understanding such as that of 11th-century Berengarius. Radbertus, on the other hand, developed the realism of the Gallican and Roman liturgy and the Ambrosian theology of the identity of the sacramental and historical body of the Lord. The dispute ended with Radbertus&#x27;s letter to Frudiger, in which he stressed further the identity of the sacramental and historical body of Christ, but met the opposing view to the extent of emphasizing the spiritual nature of the sacramental body. Friedrich Kempf comments: &quot;Since Paschasius had identified the Eucharistic and the historical body of the Lord without more precisely explaining the Eucharistic species, his teaching could and probably did promote a grossly materialistic &#x27;Capharnaitic&#x27; interpretation&quot;.

The question of the nature of the Eucharist became virulent for a second time in the Western Church in the 11th century, when Berengar of Tours denied that any material change in the elements was needed to explain the Eucharistic presence. This caused a controversy which led to the explicit clarification of the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist.

In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council used the word &quot;transubstantiated&quot; in its profession of faith, when speaking of the change that takes place in the Eucharist.

It was only later in the 13th century that Aristotelian metaphysics was accepted and a philosophical elaboration in line with that metaphysics was developed, which found classic formulation in the teaching of Saint Thomas Aquinas. It was only then that Scholasticism cast Christian theology in the terms of Aristotelianism. The metaphysical aspects of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist were firstly described since the time of the Latin juvenile treatise titled (On the reverend sacrament of the altar).

During the later medieval period, the question was debated within the Western Church. Following the Protestant Reformation, it became a central topic of division amongst the various emerging confessions. The Lutheran doctrine of the real presence, known as the &quot;sacramental union&quot;, was formulated in the Augsburg Confession of 1530. Luther decidedly supported this doctrine, publishing &quot;The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics&quot; in 1526. Saying that &quot;bread and body are two distinct substances&quot;, he declared that &quot;out of two kinds of objects a union has taken place, which I shall call a &#x27;sacramental union.

Thus, the main theological division in this question, turned out to be not between Catholicism and Protestantism, but within Protestantism, especially between Luther and Zwingli, who discussed the question at the Marburg Colloquy of 1529 but who failed to come to an agreement. Zwingli&#x27;s view became associated with the term Memorialism, suggesting an understanding of the Eucharist held purely &quot;in memory of&quot; Christ. While this accurately describes the position of the Anabaptists and derived traditions, it is not the position held by Zwingli himself, who affirmed that Christ is &quot;truly&quot; (in substance), though not &quot;naturally&quot; (physically) present in the sacrament.

The position of the Church of England on this matter (the real presence) is clear and highlighted in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion:
The Council of Trent, held 1545–1563 in reaction to the Protestant Reformation and initiating the Catholic Counter-Reformation, promulgated the view of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist as true, real, and substantial, and declared that, &quot;by the consecration of the bread and of the wine, a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance () of the body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood; which conversion is, by the holy Catholic Church, suitably and properly called Transubstantiation&quot;. The Scholastic, Aristotelian philosophy of substance was not included in the Council&#x27;s definitive teaching, but rather the more general idea of &quot;substance&quot; that had predated Thomas Aquinas.

Eastern Orthodoxy did not become involved in the dispute prior to the 17th century. It became virulent in 1629, when Cyril Lucaris denied the doctrine of transubstantiation, using the Greek translation for the concept. To counter the teaching of Lucaris, Metropolitan Petro Mohyla of Kiev drew up in Latin an Orthodox Confession in defense of transubstantiation. This Confession was approved by all the Greek-speaking Patriarchs (those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem) in 1643, and again by the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem (also referred to as the Council of Bethlehem).

== Views ==

=== Catholic ===


The Catholic Church declares that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is true, real, and substantial. By saying Christ is truly present in the Eucharist, it excludes any understanding of the presence as merely that of a sign or figure. By stating that his presence in the Eucharist is real, it defines it as objective and independent of the thoughts and feelings of the participants, whether they have faith or not: lack of faith may make reception of the sacrament fruitless for holiness, but it does not make his presence unreal. In the third place, the Catholic Church describes the presence of Christ in the Eucharist as substantial, that is, involving the underlying substance, not the appearances of bread and wine. These maintain all their physical properties as before: unlike what happens when the appearance of something or somebody is altered but the basic reality remains the same, it is the teaching of the Catholic Church that in the Eucharist the appearance is quite unchanged, but the basic reality has become the body and blood of Christ.

The change from bread and wine to a presence of Christ that is true, real, and substantial is called &quot;transubstantiation&quot;. The Catholic Church does not consider the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; an explanation of the change: it declares that the change by which the signs of bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ occurs &quot;in a way surpassing understanding&quot;.

One hymn of the Church, &quot;Ave Verum Corpus&quot;, greets Christ in the Eucharist as follows (in translation from the original Latin): &quot;Hail, true body, born of Mary Virgin, and which truly suffered and was immolated on the cross for mankind!&quot;

The Catholic Church also holds that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is entire: it does not see what is really in the Eucharist as a lifeless corpse and mere blood, but as the whole Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity; nor does it see the persisting outward appearances of bread and wine and their properties (such as weight and nutritional value) as a mere illusion, but objectively existing as before and unchanged.

In the view of the Catholic Church, the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is of an order different from the presence of Christ in the other sacraments: in the other sacraments he is present by his power rather than by the &quot;reality&quot; of his body and blood, the basis of the description of his presence as &quot;real&quot;.

===Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian ===

The Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as the Churches of the East, believe that in the Eucharist the bread and wine are objectively changed and become in a real sense the Body and Blood of Christ. Orthodoxy rejects philosophical explanations of the change that occurs in the elements during the Divine Liturgy:
The Greek term &quot;metousiosis&quot; () is sometimes used by Eastern Orthodox Christians to describe the change since this term &quot;is not bound up with the scholastic theory of substance and accidents&quot;, but it does not have official status as &quot;a dogma of the Orthodox Communion.&quot; Similarly, Coptic Orthodox Christians, a denomination of Oriental Orthodox Christianity, &quot;are fearful of using philosophical terms concerning the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, preferring uncritical appeals to biblical passages like 1 Cor. 10.16; 11.23–29 or the discourse in John 6.26–58.&quot;

While the Roman Catholic Church believes that the change &quot;takes place at the words of institution or consecration&quot;, the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the &quot;change takes place anywhere between the Proskomedia (the Liturgy of Preparation)&quot; and &quot;the Epiklesis (&#x27;calling down&#x27;), or invocation of the Holy Spirit &#x27;upon us and upon these gifts here set forth. Therefore, it teaches that &quot;the gifts should be treated with reverence throughout the entirety of the service. We don&#x27;t know the exact time in which the change takes place, and this is left to mystery.&quot;

The words of the Coptic liturgy are representative of the faith of Oriental Orthodoxy: &quot;I believe, I believe, I believe and profess to the last breath that this is the body and the blood of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, which he took from our Lady, the holy and immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.&quot;

The Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s Synod of Jerusalem declared: &quot;We believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be present, not typically, nor figuratively, nor by superabundant grace, as in the other Mysteries, ... but truly and really, so that after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, the bread is transmuted, transubstantiated, converted and transformed into the true Body Itself of the Lord, Which was born in Bethlehem of the ever-Virgin Mary, was baptised in the Jordan, suffered, was buried, rose again, was received up, sitteth at the right hand of the God and Father, and is to come again in the clouds of Heaven; and the wine is converted and transubstantiated into the true Blood Itself of the Lord, Which, as He hung upon the Cross, was poured out for the life of the world.&quot;

=== Lutheran ===

Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, that the body and blood of Christ are &quot;truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms&quot; of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants orally eat and drink the holy body and blood of Christ Himself as well as the bread and wine (cf. Augsburg Confession, Article 10) in this Sacrament. 

The Lutheran doctrine of the real presence is more accurately and formally known as &quot;the Sacramental Union.&quot; It has been inaccurately called &quot;consubstantiation&quot;, a term which is specifically rejected by most Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine, and it subjects the doctrine to the control of an abiblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot;.

For Lutherans, there is no Sacrament unless the elements are used according to Christ&#x27;s institution (consecration, distribution, and reception). This was first articulated in the Wittenberg Concord of 1536 in the formula: &quot;Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum a Christo institutum&quot; (&quot;Nothing has the character of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by Christ&quot;). Some Lutherans use this formula as their rationale for opposing in the church the reservation of the consecrated elements, private Masses, the practice of Corpus Christi, and the belief that the &quot;reliquæ&quot; (what remains of the consecrated elements after all have communed in the worship service) are still sacramentally united to the Body and Blood of Christ. This interpretation is not universal among Lutherans. The consecrated elements are treated with reverence; and, in some Lutheran churches, are reserved as in Orthodox, Catholic, and Anglican practice. The external Eucharistic adoration is usually not practiced by most Lutherans except for bowing, genuflecting, and kneeling to receive the Eucharist from the Words of Institution and elevation to reception of the holy meal. The &quot;reliquæ&quot; traditionally are consumed by the celebrant after the people have communed, except that a small amount may be reserved for delivery to those too ill or infirm to attend the service. In this case, the consecrated elements are to be delivered quickly, preserving the connection between the communion of the ill person and that of the congregation gathered in public Divine Service.

Lutherans use the terms &quot;in, with and under the forms of consecrated bread and wine&quot; and &quot;Sacramental Union&quot; to distinguish their understanding of the Eucharist from those of the Reformed and other traditions.

=== Moravian ===
Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the &quot;most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour&quot;. The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the &quot;sacramental presence&quot;, teaching that in the sacrament of Holy Communion:

=== Reformed ===
Those in the Reformed tradition (inclusive of Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Reformed Anglican/Reformed Episcopal and Reformed Baptist churches), particularly those following John Calvin, hold that the reality of Christ&#x27;s body and blood do not come corporally (physically) to the elements, but that &quot;the Spirit truly unites things separated in space&quot; (Calvin). This view is known as the real spiritual presence, spiritual presence, or pneumatic presence of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Following a phrase of Saint Augustine, the Calvinist view is that &quot;no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith&quot;. &quot;The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God&#x27;s elect believers&quot;, Calvin said; but those who partake by faith receive benefit from Christ, and the unbelieving are condemned by partaking. By faith (not a mere mental apprehension), and in the Holy Spirit, the partaker beholds God incarnate, and in the same sense touches him with hands, so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ&#x27;s presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in.

This view holds that the elements may be disposed of without ceremony, as they are not changed in an objective physical sense and, as such, the meal directs attention toward Christ&#x27;s &quot;bodily&quot; resurrection and return. Actual practices of disposing of leftover elements vary widely.

The Reformed doctrine of Holy Communion (The Lord&#x27;s Supper, The Eucharist) is the belief in the Real Presence (pneumatic) in the sacrament and that it is a Holy Mystery. Reformed theology has traditionally taught that Jesus&#x27; body is seated in heaven at the right hand of God; therefore his body is not physically present in the elements, nor do the elements turn into his body in a physical or any objective sense. However, Reformed theology has also historically taught that when the Holy Communion is received, not only the Spirit, but also the true body and blood of Jesus Christ are received through the Spirit, but these are only received by those partakers who eat worthily (i.e., repentantly) with faith. The Holy Spirit unites the Christian with Jesus though they are separated by a great distance. See, e.g., Westminster Confession of Faith, ch. 29; Belgic Confession, Article 35.

The Congregationalist theologian Alfred Ernest Garvie explicated the Congregationalist belief regarding the pneumatic presence in &quot;The Holy Catholic Church from the Congregational Point of View&quot;:

The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, in which Reformed Baptists believe, affirms the Lord&#x27;s Supper to be a means of &quot;spiritual nourishment and growth&quot;, stating:

In 1997, three denominations which historically held to a Reformed view of the supper—the Reformed Church in America, the United Church of Christ, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) (representative of the Continental Reformed, Congregationalist and Presbyterian traditions)—signed &quot;A Formula of Agreement&quot; with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, a document which stressed that: &quot;The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, page 66).&quot; Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the real presence (see open communion), the churches have affirmed belief real presence of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper while understanding that differences exist between the Lutheran and Reformed views on this:

=== Anglican ===
Anglicans prefer a view of objective presence that maintains a definitive change, but allows how that change occurs to remain a mystery. Likewise, Methodists postulate a &quot;par excellence&quot; presence as being a &quot;Holy Mystery&quot;. Anglicans generally and officially believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specific forms of that belief range from a corporeal presence (real objective presence), sometimes even with Eucharistic adoration (mainly high church Anglo-Catholics), to belief in a pneumatic presence (mainly low church Reformed Anglicans).

In Anglican theology, a sacrament is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. In the Eucharist, the outward and visible sign is that of bread and wine, while the inward and spiritual grace is that of the Body and Blood of Christ. The classic Anglican aphorism with regard to the debate on the Eucharist is the poem by John Donne (1572–1631): &quot;He was the Word that spake it; He took the bread and brake it; And what that Word did make it; I do believe and take it&quot; (&quot;Divine Poems. On the Sacrament&quot;).

During the English Reformation the doctrine of the Church of England was strongly influenced by Continental Reformed theologians whom Cranmer had invited to England to aid with the reforms. Among these were Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Bernardino Ochino, Paul Fagius, and Jan Łaski. John Calvin was also urged to come to England by Cranmer, but declined, saying that he was too involved in the Swiss reforms. Consequently, early on, the Church of England has a strong Reformed, if not particularly Calvinistic influence. The view of the real presence, as taught in the &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles&quot; therefore bears much resemblance to the doctrine of the pneumatic presence of Christ in the Eucharist, held by Bucer, Martyr and Calvin.

The Anglican &quot;Thirty-Nine Articles&quot; of Religion contends that:

For many Anglicans, whose mysticism is intensely incarnational, it is extremely important that God has used the mundane and temporal as a means of giving people the transcendent and eternal. Some have extended this view to include the idea of a presence that is in the realm of spirit and eternity, and not to be about corporeal-fleshiness.

During the Oxford Movement of the 19th century, Tractarians advanced a belief in the real objective presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but maintained that the details of how He is present remain a mystery of faith, a view also held by the Orthodox Church and Methodist Church. Indeed, one of the oldest Anglo-Catholic devotional societies, the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, was founded largely to promote belief in the real objective presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

From some Anglican perspectives, the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist does not imply that Jesus Christ is present materially or locally. This is in accord with the standard Roman Catholic view as expressed, for instance by St. Thomas Aquinas, who, while saying that &quot;the whole Christ&quot; is present in the sacrament, also said that this presence was not &quot;as in a place&quot;. &quot;Real&quot; does not mean material: the lack of the latter does not imply the absence of the former. The Eucharist is not intrinsic to Christ as a body part is to a body, but extrinsic as his instrument to convey Divine Grace. Some Anglicans see this understanding as compatible with different theories of Christ&#x27;s presence—a corporeal presence, consubstantation, or pneumatic presence—without getting involved in the mechanics of &quot;change&quot; or trying to explain a mystery of God&#x27;s own doing.

Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians participating in the first Anglican—Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC I) declared that they had &quot;reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist&quot;. This claim was accepted by the 1988 Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops (Resolution 8), but firmly questioned in the &quot;Official Roman Catholic Response to the Final Report of ARCIC I&quot; of 1991.

=== Methodist ===
The followers of John Wesley have typically affirmed that the sacrament of Holy Communion is an instrumental Means of Grace through which the real presence of Christ is communicated to the believer, but have otherwise allowed the details to remain a mystery. In particular, Methodists reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation (see Article XVIII of the Articles of Religion); the Primitive Methodist Church in its &quot;Discipline&quot; also rejects the Lollardist doctrine of consubstantiation. In 2004, the United Methodist Church affirmed its view of the sacrament and its belief in the real presence in an official document entitled &quot;This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion&quot;. Of particular note here is the church&#x27;s unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a &quot;re-presentation&quot; of Christ Jesus and his Love.


In conformity with &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists&quot;, Methodism&#x27;s first liturgical text, in congregations of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Bethel Methodist Church, Congregational Methodist Church, Evangelical Methodist Church, Evangelical Wesleyan Church, First Bible Holiness Church, First Congregational Methodist Church, Free Methodist Church, Lumber River Conference of the Holiness Methodist Church, Metropolitan Church Association, Pilgrim Holiness Church, among many other Methodist connexions, the presider says the following when delivering the Eucharistic elements to each of the faithful (which is reflective of the Methodist teachings of the real presence of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the Lord&#x27;s Supper being a sacramental means of grace):

This affirmation of real presence is also illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgy where, in the epiclesis of the Great Thanksgiving, the celebrating minister prays over the elements:

Methodists assert that Jesus is truly present, and that the means of his presence is a &quot;Holy Mystery&quot;. The communion hymn &quot;&quot;, by Methodist divine Charles Wesley includes the following stanza and is often sung during Methodist services of worship in which the Lord&#x27;s Supper is celebrated:

The distinctive feature of the Methodist doctrine of the real presence is that the way Christ manifests his presence in the Eucharist is a sacred mystery—the focus is that Christ &quot;is&quot; truly present in the sacrament. The &quot;Discipline&quot; of the Free Methodist Church thus teaches:

Many within the Holiness Pentecostal tradition, which is largely Wesleyan–Arminian in theology as are the Methodist Churches, also affirm this understanding of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

=== Irvingian ===
Edward Irving, who founded the Irvingian Churches, such as the New Apostolic Church, taught the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist; &quot;Irving insisted on the real presence of the &quot;humiliated&quot; humanity of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.&quot; The Catholic Apostolic Church has thus held to &quot;the doctrine of the real presence of Christ with regard to the elements in the communion service&quot;. In the Irvingian tradition of Restorationist Christianity, consubstantiation is taught as the explanation of how the real presence is effected in the liturgy. &quot;The Catechism of the New Apostolic Church&quot;, the largest of the Irvingian denominations, teaches:

=== Zwinglian ===
Huldrych Zwingli, a Swiss Reformer, taught:

Those who adhere to the Zwinglian view, do so at Jesus&#x27;s words about doing this in &quot;remembrance&quot; rather than any transformation or any physical presence. Rather, Christ is really present at the thanksgiving, and in the memory. Zwingli&#x27;s words that the &quot;true body of Christ is eaten in a sacramental and spiritual manner&quot; is understood in a way where the physical objects and actions are the spiritual reminder of what Jesus had done, that He has instituted. This comes from the belief that the historical understanding of the Early Church taught that sacraments are done in &quot;contemplation of faith&quot; as the &quot;proclamation of salvation and the strengthening of faith in the hearts of believers&quot;. General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, some non-denominational Churches see Communion (also called the Lord&#x27;s Supper or the Lord&#x27;s Table) as signifying the body and blood of Jesus, a memorial of the Last Supper and the Passion with symbolic and meaningful elements, which is done by the ordinance of Jesus. This view is known as Memorialism or the Zwinglian view, as it was taught by Zwingli, a Swiss Reformer. Those who hold to the memorial understanding deny the strong sense of Transubstantiation as articulated by Lanfranc in the 11th century, arguing more akin to Berengarius who was a symbolist. It is pointed out that while early Church Fathers used the language of real presence, this is not similar to a hard understanding of Transubstantiation. Rather, interpreting in the context of other early Church Father writings, those who emphasize the symbolic nature of the Eucharist, point out the symbolic language used by Tertullian, Cyprian, and others, noting a differentiation between the &quot;real presence of Christ&quot; being used to mean a bodily presence. Further it is understood that the dispute arose much later, in the 9th and 11th centuries, about the nature of the Eucharist.

Anabaptists affirm that communion is a memorial and locate the presence of Jesus not in the elements themselves, but teach that the &quot;mystery of communion with the living Christ in his Supper comes into being by the power of the Spirit, dwelling in and working through the collected members of Christ’s Body&quot;. As such, in celebrations of the Eucharist, &quot;Anabaptist congregations looked to the living Christ in their hearts and in their midst, who transformed members and elements together into a mysterious communion, creating his Body in many members, ground like grains and crushed like grapes, into one bread and one drink.&quot;

==Consecration, presidency and distribution==

Many Christian churches holding to a doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist (for example, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Moravian, Anglican, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, Reformed, and Irvingian) reserve to ordained clergy the function of consecrating the Eucharist, but not necessarily that of distributing the elements to communicants. Others do not speak of ordination but still reserve these functions to leaders who are given titles such as pastor, elder and deacon.

<text>Victorino de la Plaza (2 November 1840 – 2 October 1919) was an Argentine politician and lawyer who served as President of Argentina from 9 August 1914 to 11 October 1916.

As the second son of José Roque Mariano de la Plaza Elejalde and Manuela Silva; his older brother, Rafael de la Plaza, was also a politician and acted as governor of Santiago del Estero Province.

He studied law in Buenos Aires and obtained his doctorate in 1868, became secretary of Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield and collaborated on the writing of the Argentine Civil Code, and was Treasury Minister under Nicolás Avellaneda (1876), later Interventor in Corrientes Province (1878) and Foreign Minister (1882) and Treasury (1883–1885) during the first Julio Argentino Roca administration. He was elected vice president for the National Union presided by Roque Sáenz Peña in 1910, and assumed the presidency after the death of Sáenz Peña and governed between 1914 and 1916. He died of pneumonia after retiring from politics.

He was the last president of what was called the conservative period of Argentine history. This period began in 1880 and culminated with La Plaza&#x27;s loss of the presidency to the Radical Civic Union. This was all thanks to the Sáenz Peña Law, which established secret, compulsory voting for all those on the electoral register, thanks to Compulsory military service.

== Childhood and early life ==
Victorino de La Plaza was born on 2 November 1840, in Payagosta, Salta Province, Argentina. He was the son of Jose Mariano Roque de La Plaza y Elejalde, and Maria Manuela Silva. His brother was Rafel de La Plaza, who was governor of the province of Santiago del Estero. Upon his Father&#x27;s death, his mother took charge of raising the Children.

Victorino began his scholastic education at an Argentine public school, yet he stayed in that school for a short period of time, because he entered a Franciscan convent. During his childhood he did a little bit of work, he sold newspapers, sweets and empanadas that were prepared by his mother. After this, he began working as an attorney and as a scribe. Subsequently he passed and examination before the Supreme Court of Justice, for which he obtained the title of rotary in 1859.

He gained a scholarship granted by the government of the Confederation which allowed him to enter the Colegio de Uruguay. It is unknown exactly when he was admitted, but it is known that it was between 1859 and 1862. After this period of his education, he went to Buenos Aires, to enter Buenos Aires University. He proved to be an outstanding student and thus, this allowed President Mitre to appoint him to the position of Second Clerk, of the National Accounting Office. He was first appointed scribe, though, in 1864.

=== Military career ===
Victorino De La Plaza had a distinctly short military career. When the Triple Alliance War began, he abandoned his university studies to join an Artillery Regiment. He was chosen to be an assistant to General Julio de Vedia; a member of the Argentinian military with a prominent role against the Mapuches and in the Triple Alliance War, who was also Governor of the Chaco National Territory. He fought in the Battles of Estero Bellaco, on 2 May 1866, and the Battle of Tuyuti on 24 May of the same year. Subsequently the Government of Uruguay awarded him both the Silver Sol medal for his actions in the battle of Estero Bellaco and with the award of the Cords of Honor for his performance at the Battle of Tuyuti. Bartolome Mitre, promoted him to the rank of Captain, and have him a mention for his heroism. However, although he had performed exceptionally well he had to return to Buenos Aires due to the fact that he suffered from health problems.

=== Law ===
Upon his return to Buenos Aires, he enrolled in the Law faculty at Buenos Aires University. He graduated on 13 July 1868 with his thesis called Credit as Capital. His godfather was Dalmacio Velez Sarsfield. Whom he worked, as a scribe, for while Dalmacio was drafting the Civil code.

<doc id="717898" wikidata="Q2093999" url="?curid=717898" title="Trail running">
<text>Trail running is a type of running that takes place on outdoor trails, often in mountainous terrain, and often includes significant ascents and descents. Trail running is overseen by the International Trail Running Association (ITRA) and includes longer races.

It is similar to both mountain and fell running (also known as hill running). Unlike road running and track running, it generally takes place on outdoor trails, often in mountainous terrain, and often includes significant ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish trail running from cross country running. In general, however, cross country running is a discipline governned by World Athletics, which is typically raced over shorter distances, while trail running is overseen by ITRA and includes longer races.

Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running. This move to nature is also reflected in a large increase in competitors in non-traditional/off-road triathlons and adventure racing in the 2010s.

== Equipment ==

When comparing a trail-running shoe to a road-running shoe, trail-running shoes are built for more rugged terrain. They have noticeably thicker outsoles allowing for better traction on the trails and stiffer midsoles for support on uneven and rocky surfaces. Other features like added heel and toe protection and waterproof technologies are also found in trail shoes.

Trail-running gear can vary depending on specific trail and weather conditions but can include wicking garments, water bottles, sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, gaiters, insect repellent spray, headlamps, headphones, and ivy block. Some trail runners attach lightweight crampons to the bottom of their shoes to aid with traction in the snow and on ice. Ultra-light hiking poles or trekking poles can be used to increase speed and stability. Water may be stored inside a hydration bladder with a drinking tube, carried in a backpack, waist pack, or hydration pack.

==Races==

Trail running races are organized globally and vary in distance, terrain, and vertical climb. For example, in the United States, the American Trail Running Association was only founded in 1996 to represent trail races in the US. In the United Kingdom, the Trail Running Association was formed in 1991. The International Trail Running Association (ITRA) was founded in 2013, and was first recognized by the IAAF in 2015.

Distances in races vary widely, from 5 km, to over 100 miles (161 km). Many trail races are of ultramarathon distance. Races of similar distances often differ significantly in terms of terrain, which makes it difficult to compare performance across different courses. This is in contrast to times over standard distances in road running, such as 10 km or marathon.

The International Triathlon Union conducts an annual Cross Triathlon World Championship race. Additionally, the XTERRA Triathlon is a private off-road series that concludes with a championship each year in Maui.

== Aid stations ==
Aid stations are physical checkpoints commonly located every 5 to 10 kilometers along the course. Ultramarathon aid stations are often stocked with foods that provide runners with quickly digestible sugars that can provide a needed boost as their glycogen levels begin to drop. Most trail races only have a single stage, where competitors are timed over the entire duration of their run, including stops at aid stations. However, trail running stage races also exist. These multiday-stage races usually offer complete support and runner amenities between stages. There are, however, stage races that provide no support apart from water and medical aid, and require competitors to carry all their equipment (food, sleeping bag, change of clothes, compass). The best-known example of such races is the Marathon des Sables, which was first held in 1986.

== Participation limitations ==
Compared to road races, there are often fewer participants as the number of entries is often limited. There can be a few reasons for this: narrowness of trails, national parks (where the courses are often set) may limit the number of participants via a permitting process, safety, and environmental concerns. There are many popular races such as the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in Europe or the Western States Endurance Run in the United States that have been forced to limit entries due to overwhelming demand.

Additionally, runners may be expected to behave in sportsmanlike ways that increase access and enjoyment for all participants. These actions can include yielding to uphill traffic, staying on established trails, passing on the left (United States), staying single file, and yielding to fast runners.

===Fastpacking===
A growing number of people are participating in solo backcountry trail running trips, carrying an ultralight form of backpacking to allow faster speeds than with a traditional backpack. Running while backpacking has been termed &quot;fastpacking&quot;. These trips can be both difficult and dangerous, depending on length, weather, and terrain.

===Mountain and fell running===
Mountain and fell running (also called hill running, particularly in Scotland) are sports that combine running and racing off-road over the upland country, where the gradient climbed is a significant component. Fell is a dialect word from the northwest of England where it is popular–especially in the Lake District. Fell races require mountain navigation skills and participants carry survival equipment. Unlike trail running, the routes of fell races are often unmarked so that competitors frequently are able to choose their own route to a checkpoint.

The only difference between mountain running and trail running is that a mountain running course sometimes includes paving. It is different from fell running because (1) courses are clearly marked and avoid dangerous sections;
and (2) while mountain running takes place mainly off-road, if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used.

<doc id="717903" wikidata="Q383015" url="?curid=717903" title="Roque Sáenz Peña">
<text>Roque José Antonio del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Sáenz-Peña (19 March 1851 – 9 August 1914) was an Argentine politician and lawyer who served as President of Argentina from 12 October 1910 to his death in office on 9 August 1914. He was the son of former president Luis Sáenz-Peña. He was a candidate for an internal, modernist line within the National Autonomist Party.

He was responsible for passing Law 8871, known as &quot;Sáenz-Peña Law&quot;, which greatly reformed the Argentine electoral system, making the vote secret, universal and compulsory for males over 18. This effectively ended the rule by electoral fraud of the conservative Argentine oligarchy, the Generation of &#x27;80, and paved the way for the rise of the Radical Civic Union in the first free elections of the country.

== Early life ==

Roque Sáenz-Peña was the son of Luis Sáenz-Peña and Cipriana du Cos de La Hitte. He came from a family of supporters of Rosas: his paternal and maternal grandparents, Roque Julián Sáenz-Peña and Eduardo du Cos de La Hitte, had been deputies of the Legislature during his government. After the defeat of Rosas in the Battle of Caseros, the federal tradition of the grandparents and the father, who did not change their convictions, kept them away from public service. He completed his secondary studies at the National School of Buenos Aires, under the direction of Amadeo Jacques. In 1875 he graduated as a doctor of law, with a thesis on &quot;Legal status of foundlings.&quot; 

During the Revolution of 1874 he defended the authorities of the nation as Captain of Regiment, under the command of Luis María Campos. After the revolution, he was promoted to Second Commander of National Guards, but requested to be relieved of the ranks. Opponent of Bartolomé Mitre, he was a member of the Autonomist Party headed by Adolfo Alsina and in 1876 he was elected to a Deputy seat in the Legislature of the Province of Buenos Aires. He came to serve as president of the body at the age of 26, thus being one of the youngest presidents of the House. In 1877 he founded the Republican Party, together with Leandro Alem, Aristóbulo del Valle, Hipólito Yrigoyen, Lucio Vicente López, Pedro Goyena, José Manuel Estrada and Francisco Uriburu.

In 1878, as a result of the dissidents produced within the autonomism due to the conciliation policy initiated by President Nicolás Avellaneda to which Sáenz-Peña was opposed, he resigned from his position and ended up temporarily abandoning politics.

On 4 February 1887, he married Rosa Isidora González, daughter of the Mendoza politician Lucas González and Rosa Delgado, in the Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar (Buenos Aires).
=== War of the Pacific ===
The War of the Pacific (La Guerra del Pacífico) pitted Chile against an allied Bolivia and Peru. Later, Argentina secretly joined the alliance. The dispute was over territory on the Pacific coast that had never been resolved, specifically control of a part of the Atacama Desert. The area contained high amounts of sodium nitrate which is a valuable mineral resource.

During the war, Sáenz-Peña left Argentina to fight with the Peruvian Army. His main motivation was not patriotic or to show solidarity, but rather to escape Buenos Aires due to an unrequited love affair. After his superior officers had been killed in the Battle of Arica he assumed their roles and commanded a very weak Peruvian division. Sáenz Peña was captured after the Peruvians&#x27; defeat at the battle and imprisoned briefly by the Chileans.

== Rise to power ==
When Sáenz Peña returned to Buenos Aires he was appointed sub-secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Relations under Minister of Foreign Relations Bernardo de Irigoyen in 1880. He soon left politics only to return in 1887 when he accepted the ministership to Uruguay. He represented Argentina at the 1888 Montevideo Congress. Sáenz Peña held firm to his legal and political doctrines and definitively stated that Argentine was immune to any action taken by the assembly.

Along with Manuel Quintana, Sáenz Peña represented Argentina in the first Pan American Conference in 1889. The two delegates made a 40-day journey to New York and then a four-day trip to Washington for the meeting that was taking placed in the State Department building. The Argentine delegation boycotted the opening meeting over, as they saw it, a violation of diplomatic custom. Custom requires a delegate from an invited country to preside over the conference, but the U.S. Secretary of State was elected to be the permanent chair of the conference.

The delegates attended the second session. Throughout the conference Sáenz Peña advocated against an American free trade area. Nevertheless, the United States and twelve nations voted for a “recommendation to work for inter-American reciprocity treaties.” Only Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia voted against it.

During Sáenz Peña&#x27;s tenure as foreign minister, he traveled the world and effectively argued for policies that benefited Argentina. He also performed traditional ceremonial duties, like in 1906 when he attended the wedding of King Alfonso XIII of Spain. He worked with the Italian government to increase trade while providing them with official cables from Argentina telling of the economic developments within the country. He distributed these cables to other European governments and businessmen as well. Before his presidency, Sáenz Peña served as ambassador to Spain (1906–1907) and Italy (1907–1910).

== Presidency ==

The electoral act that led Roque Sáenz Peña to the presidency of Argentina took place on 13 March 1910, with a large number of irregularities common at that time. The new president had not even participated in the electoral campaign: he was the Argentine ambassador to Italy. A single list of elector candidates participated in the elections, of which ten - out of 273 - did not vote for Sáenz Peña.

Days before assuming the presidency, Sáenz Peña met with President Figueroa Alcorta and with the leader of the opposition, Hipólito Yrigoyen. In this last interview, the radical leader promised to abandon the revolutionary path, and Sáenz Peña to promulgate an electoral law that would modernize the elections and prevent electoral fraud. Yrigoyen requested the intervention of the provinces to prevent their governors from interfering with said process, Sáenz Peña refused but allowed radicalism to be part of the government.

=== Governance management ===

On 12 October 1910, Roque Sáenz Peña assumed the presidency of Argentina. In his first inaugural address he declared: “My international policy if known to you. It will be friendship for Europe and fraternity for America.” He came into power without the support of his own party, like his father. Sáenz Peña was elected while tensions were high in 1910 while promising electoral reform to curb the power of the oligarchy and to prevent a revolution.

In 1912 - at the initiative of the Minister of Agriculture, Ezequiel Ramos Mexía - Law 5,599, on the Promotion of National Territories, was enacted. Most of the national territories had the vast majority of their population concentrated on their maritime or fluvial coastline; For this reason, the law provided - and to a great extent succeeded - the construction of a large number of railway branches, which would allow the establishment of its population towards the interior. Branches were built in the national territories of Chaco, Formosa, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz; and a railroad branch even reached Posadas, the capital of Misiones.

On 10 August 1912, he signed the decree for the creation of the Military Aviation School (EMA), together with G. Vélez, according to the official bulletin 692-2 part). In the same it was established that in the meantime there would be no military personnel trained in Aerostation and Aviation, the Technical Directorate would be in charge of the Argentine Aeroclub and the Military Directorate in charge of the Chief of the Argentine Army with the title of Director of the School of Military Aviation .

=== The cry of Alcorta ===

In June 1912 a great protest movement broke out among the tenant farmers against the worsening of the conditions of their contracts with the owners of the fields they worked, known as the Grito de Alcorta. It spread throughout the Pampas region and ended with a massive drop in rents. It marked the irruption of a portion of the rural middle class, formed by the farmers, in the national politics of the 20th century. But at the same time, a gradual trend towards the owners&#x27; own administration of the fields began, who began to consider the presence of tenants dangerous.
=== The Sáenz Peña Law ===
Sáenz Peña was a convinced democrat; He thought that, freed from professional politicians, the people would elect the best for their government. He was also concerned about the social question, that is, about the possibility that - apart from politics - the workers could adhere to anarchism or socialism. Finally, he feared that the huge proportion of the foreign population, who did not participate in any way in politics, could fall into maximalist positions or remain a foreign body in society. For all these reasons he supported political reform based on universal and free voting.

Given the history of pressure on the voters - who voted aloud - the only possibility of electoral freedom was secret suffrage, through ballots written in sealed envelopes. And to ensure that no one was prevented from voting, he also made it universal and mandatory. The military registry would be used as the electoral roll. On the other hand, the participation of the population in the elections was very low, barely exceeding 20% of potential voters.

Sáenz Peña presented the project in Congress with these words: &quot;I have told my country all my thoughts, my convictions and my hopes. May my country listen to the word and the advice of its first president, let the people vote.&quot;

The person in charge of designing the project and defending it in Congress was the Minister of the Interior, the Catholic Indalecio Gómez. He had to face stiff resistance from conservative deputies, whose privileges were clearly threatened by the reform, and who did not know any other way of doing politics. Thus, many legislators from the conservative sectors, still not openly opposing it, obstruct the reform. After a month of discussion in the Chamber of Deputies and a week in the Senate, the Sáenz Peña Law was approved and promulgated on 13 February 1912.

The law was a great advance in its time since it allowed large masses of the population to participate in the electoral act, although it was still far from being completely universal: women and foreigners - who at that time were a large part of society - still had no right to vote. Although they did not vote, they were instead taken into account when determining the population of the districts and the number of deputies that could be elected by each one.

The first test of the Law in operation was in a provincial election: the Province of Santa Fe was intervened by the government, which ordered the holding of the governor&#x27;s elections in accordance with the Sáenz Peña Law; the UCR abandoned abstentionism and participated, achieving victory. Shortly after, he obtained a new victory in the deputy elections in the City of Buenos Aires, in an election in which popular participation amounted to 62.85% of the electoral roll; the Socialist Party also obtained a notable growth in them.

== Death ==

From the time of the assumption of Roque Sáenz Peña as president, his health was not good, but it worsened significantly from the year 1913. The version that circulated at the time was that the president suffered the neurological consequences of syphilis that was it would have been infected during the War of the Pacific. In early October 1913, he delegated the government on his Vice-President Victorino de la Plaza, as he took a leave of absence.

Sáenz Peña was the only president who lived in the Casa Rosada because of his sensitive health that prevented him from traveling with his cart from home. He adopted a sector as his home and had heating, rugs, rocking chairs and stained glass installed. During the last days of his life, Sáenz Peña remarked “I have lost almost all my friends, but I have governed for the Republic.” 

He died 3 years and 301 days after assuming the presidency, on 9 August 1914. He was buried the next day in the Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

===Legacy===

Sáenz Peña is known today for his electoral reform and his fierce determination to protect the interests of Argentina abroad. In Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires, he is also very honored, having streets, avenues and towns with his name. An example of this is:
* The President Roque Sáenz Peña Avenue in Buenos Aires.
* The subway station Sáenz Peña in Buenos Aires, Province.
* City Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña in Chaco.

&quot;among others.&quot;

The figure of Roque Sáenz Peña -as a soldier- is very remembered in Peru, where many cities in this country have a street with the name of Sáenz Peña and there are monuments to his memory. In Rio de Janeiro, his name is remembered in Plaza Sáenz Peña.

<text>Xavier University of Louisiana (XULA) is a private historically black Catholic university in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is the only Catholic HBCU. Upon the canonization of Katharine Drexel in 2000 it became the first Catholic university founded by a saint.

==History==
=== Background ===
Katharine Drexel, a Catholic nun possessing a substantial inheritance from her father, banker-financier Francis Drexel, founded and staffed many institutions throughout the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, in an effort to help educate and evangelize Native Americans and African Americans. Many of her chosen staff included sisters of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, the religious order she founded and served in as the first Superior General.

Aware of the lack of Catholic education for young black people in the South during Jim Crow, she planned to establish a high school in New Orleans. The chosen site had been previously occupied by Southern University on Magazine Street, a black institution which had moved to Baton Rouge after an influx of white neighbors petitioned for its relocation.

Drexel sent the Josephite priest Pierre Oscar LeBeau to survey the property, to avoid public scrutiny and controversy, as her reputation for establishing black schools was well known. On April 13, 1915, Harry McEnerny, serving as Drexel&#x27;s agent, purchased the property for US$18,000. She knew that the city and community would never approve a sale for a black institution, but by going through an agent, the sale was allowed; even so, vandals smashed all the windows after learning of Drexel&#x27;s intent.

=== High school era ===
The high school opened on 27 September 1915 as Southern University of New Orleans, later re-named after Francis Xavier (the namesake of Katharine&#x27;s father). In May 1916, it was incorporated under the title, &quot;Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, of Louisiana,&quot; according to the laws of the state, and the new name, &quot;Xavier University&quot;, was cut into the stone slab above the main entrance. (The high school, Xavier Prep, remained in operation until 2013; today, St. Katharine Drexel Preparatory School operates from the same location.)

In 1917, Xavier expanded to include a normal school to provide training for black teachers, as Archbishop James H. Blenk was eager for graduates to teach at six planned new black parishes. On September 9, 1921, the Louisiana Department of Education officially recognized &quot;Xavier University&quot; as a State Approved High School. By 1922, the school was described as the only Catholic institution in the United States that offered &quot;a full four years&#x27; high school course to colored boys.&quot; While this may not be true, Xavier University was by far the most prominent Catholic institution offering such educational opportunities at the time.

=== University founding ===
In 1925, Xavier University of Louisiana came into being when the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was established, with the Josephite priest Edward Brunner as the first president. The Louisiana Department of Education officially recognized Xavier University as a four-year college on March 19, 1928, with the first degrees awarded that spring. The College of Pharmacy was next to be opened, in 1927. Alongside Drexel&#x27;s sisters, the Josephites served as some of the school&#x27;s first male teachers, and as chaplains.

Recognizing the university&#x27;s need for a separate identity and room to expand, Drexel bought a tract of undeveloped land for a campus on the corner of Palmetto and Pine Streets in 1929. To avoid blockage of the deal, Drexel again purchased the property through an agent.

Construction of the U-shaped, Gothic Revival-style Main Building, Convent and Library, made from Indiana limestone and now on the National Register of Historic Places, were completed between 1932 and 1937. The Main Administration Building was dedicated by the Archbishop of Philadelphia, Cardinal Dennis Joseph Dougherty, on Columbus Day, October 12, 1932. The Administration building is a City of New Orleans landmark.

===Modern history===
In May 1961, a group of Freedom Riders, arrived in New Orleans by plane after bus drivers in Alabama refused to take them to Montgomery, Alabama. Locals, aware of the fire bombings and other attacks against other Freedom Riders, refused to accommodate them with lodging out of fear of retaliatory violence. Norman C. Francis, the university&#x27;s Dean of Men, secretly arranged for the group to stay several days in a dormitory on campus. He had received permission from University President Sister Mary Josephina to allow the group to occupy space on the third floor of St. Michael&#x27;s Hall under the condition that the press would not be alerted as to the move.

In 1987, Pope John Paul II addressed the presidents of all U.S. Catholic colleges from the courtyard of the Xavier administration building.

When Hurricane Katrina struck the New Orleans area in August 2005, Xavier, located in the lower-lying Gert Town section and adjacent to the Washington-Palmetto Canal, suffered damage to almost every structure on campus. Many buildings sat partially submerged for extended periods of time following the hurricane. University president Francis organized boats and buses to transport stranded faculty, staff, and students from the campus to safe areas. Students began returning to the university in January 2006.

In April 2006, the nation of Qatar donated $17.5 million to assist the university in hurricane recovery and in expanding the school&#x27;s College of Pharmacy. The groundbreaking in 2008 was attended by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, leader of Qatar, and on 15 October 2010 the school&#x27;s Qatar Pharmacy Pavilion opened, adding adjacent to the existing College of Pharmacy building.

Senator Barack Obama gave the commencement speech in August 2006. New Orleans&#x27; archbishop, Alfred C. Hughes, declined to attend, citing that Obama was not opposed to abortion, and that he had not been consulted prior to the event. Obama returned after becoming president, visiting New Orleans in August 2010 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. He gave an address at Xavier complimenting the work of the leaders of the community and affirming the commitment to continue to aid in the rebuilding of the area.

The university received the &quot;Katrina Compassion Award&quot; from the United States government Corporation for National and Community Service in 2006, for the efforts of an estimated 60% of its students in rebuilding the neighborhoods damaged by the hurricane.

Xavier&#x27;s campus was evacuated during Hurricane Ida in August 2021, 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina. Students who remained on campus were later evacuated to Dallas. The school resumed operations as normal on September 13

=== Philanthropy ===
In July 2020, Xavier received $20 million from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

==Demographics==
=== Students ===
Though Xavier is the nation&#x27;s only historically Black and Catholic university, its doors have always been open to qualified students of any race or creed.

In fall 2020, the vast majority of the student body was Black or African American (approx. 75.1%), and 12% identified as Catholic. Xavier was also the first U.S. Catholic college to educate both men and women, though the university currently enrolls a student population that is overwhelmingly made up of women (at more than 75%). Almost half of Xavier&#x27;s students (43.8%) in the fall of 2020 were from Louisiana. Non-local enrollment continues to increase, with students coming in from at least 40 other states and sixteen foreign countries.

=== Faculty ===
As of fall 2020, Xavier had a full-time faculty of 236 educators, both religious and lay, of diverse ethnic and racial origins—95 percent of whom have terminal degrees—providing a student/faculty ratio of 12.5/1.

Forty-four faculty members serve as endowed chairs or professors, which provides additional financial support for their research and teaching.

Unique among HBCUs, Xavier has a higher percentage of non-Black faculty than Black as of 2022.

Xavier&#x27;s College of Pharmacy is one of just two pharmacy schools in Louisiana. Xavier consistently ranks among the top three colleges in the nation in graduating African Americans with Pharm.D. degrees.

===Dual degree engineering program===
Xavier does not offer engineering degrees but belongs to partnerships with several engineering institutions that automatically admit qualified Xavier science students interested in pursuing a bachelor&#x27;s in an engineering discipline. Students who successfully complete the program will receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Xavier and the chosen engineering institution in approximately five years. Engineering institutions in partnership with Xavier are Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Southern University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University, University of Notre Dame, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, University of Detroit Mercy, Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Wisconsin at Madison.

=== Institute for Black Catholic Studies ===
In 1979, the Institute for Black Catholic Studies was founded at XULA by Fr Thaddeus Posey, OFM Cap, with the help of Frs Augustus Taylor; David Benz; Joseph Nearon, SSS; and Sr Jamie Phelps, OP. Every summer since, IBCS has hosted a variety of accredited courses on Black Catholic theology, ministry, ethics, and history, offering a Continuing Education &amp; Enrichment program as well as a Master of Theology degree—&quot;the only graduate theology program in the western hemisphere taught from a black Catholic perspective&quot;. It is currently headed by Dr. Kathleen Dorsey Bellow.

=== Xavier Exponential ===
Established in 2018, Xavier Exponential is the university&#x27;s holistically selective honors program for high-achieving undergraduate students. Students admitted to the program have access to special funding and learning opportunities.

== Special programs ==

=== Center for Equity, Justice, and the Human Spirit ===
In 2018, David Robinson-Morris founded the university&#x27;s Center for Equity, Justice, and the Human Spirit (CEJHS), a social justice hub and a space for scholarly research and community-driven systems change.

The first of its kind at an HBCU, the center&#x27;s focus is to shift oppressive policies and practices in education, criminal justice, and environmental sustainability. The Center aims to honor the faith and principles of XULA&#x27;s foundress, St. Katharine, and benefits from a planning grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.
Robinson-Morris departed the university in December 2020, saying that he was overworked, undervalued, and that his concerns about the university&#x27;s administrative issues were not being fully heard and addressed. Cirecie Olatunji was appointed the new director in 2022.

==Campus life==
===S.B.S. Sisters===
The Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament remain a presence on campus, providing much-needed staffing and some financial assistance, but today Xavier is governed by a board of trustees.

===Student organizations===
* Student Government Association
* Homecoming Committee
* Student Advisory Board
* Student Life Council
* Pharmacy Student Association
* Residence Hall Association
* Commuter/Off-Campus Student Network

* Academic/departmental clubs
* Honor societies
* Professional Greek organizations
* NPHC Greek organizations
* Special interest organizations

==Athletics==

The Xavier athletics teams are called the Gold Rush and Gold Nuggets. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Red River Athletic Conference (RRAC) since the 2021–22 academic year. The Gold Rush and Gold Nuggets previously competed in the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) from 1981–82 to 2020–21.

XULA competes in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, tennis and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball; and co-ed sports include competitive cheer. Former sports included football.

===Facilities===
Xavier&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams compete on campus in the Xavier University Academic Convocation Center. The Convocation Center is a $25 million facility with a seating capacity of 4,500.

== Media ==
=== &quot;Xavier Herald&quot; ===
The &quot;Xavier Herald&quot;, the university&#x27;s student newspaper, has served as an outlet of the student voice, especially during the Civil Rights Movement and thereafter. The Herald was first published in 1925, coinciding with the first year that Xavier University of Louisiana began offering college-level courses. The original title of the newspaper was La Cigale, which means grasshopper, or cicada, in French. The title was changed in 1928 to &quot;The Xavier Herald&quot;, to identify the paper more with the university. The newspaper has been published continuously since, with issues scheduled monthly during the Fall and Spring semesters, but with less regular issues during the summer. It was instrumental in the fight for more Black faculty—the university remains one of the few HBCUs with more White faculty than Black—and for the hiring of Dr. Francis as the university&#x27;s first lay president, as most of the previous presidents were from the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who—despite serving minority communities—are largely White.

=== Other media ===
The university currently houses a student radio station, YouTube channel, and a podcast.

<text>Tomislav Nikolić (, ; born 15 February 1952) is a Serbian former politician who served as the president of Serbia from 2012 to 2017. A former member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS), he disassociated himself from the party in 2008 and formed the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) which he led until 2012. 

Born in Bajčetina, a village near Kragujevac, Nikolić was a long-time member of parliament for SRS. He served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia from 1998 to 1999 and Deputy Prime Minister of FR Yugoslavia in the coalition government from 1999 to 2000. Nikolić was the deputy leader of SRS from 2003, and he briefly served as the President of the National Assembly of Serbia in 2007. In 2008, he resigned following a disagreement with party leader Vojislav Šešelj regarding Serbia&#x27;s relations with the European Union, as Nikolić became in favour of Serbia&#x27;s accession to the EU, a move that was staunchly opposed by Šešelj and his faction. Nikolić formed SNS, which several SRS members joined.

Nikolić ran for President of Yugoslavia in the 2000 elections and placed third. He also ran four times for President of Serbia (in 2003, 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections). In 2003, he garnered the most votes, but the election was cancelled due to low turnout, while in 2004 and 2008 he was placed second behind Boris Tadić. In 2012, he won the run-off against Tadić to become President of Serbia.

== Early life ==
Tomislav Nikolić was born in Kragujevac. His father, Radomir, was a labourer, and his mother, Živadinka (née Đoković), was a housewife. In his youth, he trained in athletics. He completed secondary technical school in Kragujevac. His first employment was as a cemetery supervisor. In 1971 he began working with the building construction company &quot;Žegrap&quot;, and in 1978 he worked for the company &quot;22 December&quot; in Kragujevac as head of the Investment and Maintenance Department. He was also the Technical Director of the Utility Services company in Kragujevac. He and his wife Dragica (née Ninković) have two sons.

== Political career ==
=== Serbian Radical Party ===
Nikolić began his political career as vice-president of the People&#x27;s Radical Party. Under his initiative, a fraction of the People&#x27;s Radical Party merged with Vojislav Šešelj&#x27;s Serbian National Renewal to form the Serbian Radical Party. Šešelj was elected president of the new party and Nikolić as vice-president. The party had been described by some as a Chetnik party oriented towards neo-fascism and striving for the territorial expansion of Serbia. The Chetniks were a World War II movement in Yugoslavia led by Draža Mihailović, who was accused of collaboration with the occupying forces and war crimes. In 1993, during the Bosnian War, Nikolić was proclaimed as Chetnik voivode by Šešelj in a ceremony on the Romanija Mountain.

Nikolić has been a deputy in the National Assembly of Serbia since 1991, the only one elected continuously since that year. Under Slobodan Milošević and the Socialist Party of Serbia, he and Šešelj were sentenced to three months in prison which he served in Gnjilane. However, in March 1998, the Serbian Radical Party formed a coalition with the Socialist Party and he then became the vice-president of the Government of Serbia and, by the end of 1999, the vice-president of the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

In 2000, he began the first of several runs for the presidency of Serbia. In the FR Yugoslavia presidential election of 2000, he finished in third place behind Vojislav Koštunica and Slobodan Milošević. He then ran in the 2003 Serbian presidential election, in which garnered the most votes in the first round (46.23%), ahead of Dragoljub Mićunović, but the results were invalidated due to a low turnout of only 38.8%. Nikolić made yet another bid for the presidency in the 2004 presidential election. In the first round, he received 30.1% of the vote and Boris Tadić received 27.3%. In the second round held on 27 June, Nikolić lost to Tadić by 53.7% to 45.4%. On 23 February 2003, he became the party&#x27;s deputy leader after Vojislav Šešelj went voluntarily to the ICTY. During his leadership of the party, Nikolić favoured pushing the party towards focusing on more economic and social issues such as poverty and unemployment, rather than militant nationalism.

In a remark about Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić&#x27;s injured leg, Nikolić said on 28 February 2003: &quot;If anyone of you, in the following month or two, sees Zoran Đinđić somewhere, tell him that Tito also had a problem with a leg before his death&quot;. Less than two weeks later Đinđić was assassinated in Belgrade. Nikolić later apologised for his statement by saying that he would have never said that had he known what would happen. In contrast to Đinđić, Nikolić repeatedly refused to apologise for stating &quot;I don&#x27;t regret that Slavko Ćuruvija was murdered&quot;. (The journalist Slavko Ćuruvija was murdered on 11 April 1999 in front of the door of his building.)

Nikolić was elected Speaker of Parliament on 8 May 2007, defeating Milena Milošević of the Democratic Party by 142 to 99 votes out of 244 members of Parliament. The Democratic Party of Serbia endorsed him. Hajredin Kuçi of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, Ylli Hoxha of the Reformist Party ORA, and the Prime Minister of Kosovo Agim Çeku condemned the election of Nikolić as &quot;counterproductive and dangerous for Kosovo&quot;. On 9 May, Nikolić met with Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Alekseyev and gave a speech to Parliament in which he advocated making Serbia part of a Belarus-Russia superstate, saying that together they would &quot;stand up against the hegemony of America and the European Union&quot;.

He resigned from his position as speaker on 13 May after the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party of Serbia formed a preliminary alliance in preparation for a coalition government. Nikolić told the Democratic parties that if they &quot;peacefully accept&quot; the independence of Kosovo, the Radical Party &quot;will not sit calmly and wait&quot;.

In 2008, he ran again for the presidency in the 2008 presidential election. His slogan was &quot;With All Heart&quot; (; ). On 20 January 2008, Nikolić again won the first round with 39.99% of the vote. Nikolić and incumbent Boris Tadić, who garnered 35.39% of the vote, faced off against each other in a runoff election on 3 February. Nikolić lost, receiving 2,197,155 or 47.97% of the vote.

Nikolić abruptly resigned from the Radical Party leadership on 6 September 2008. Serb media cited differences between Nikolić and other members of the Radical Party hierarchy, especially party leader Vojislav Šešelj, about how the party should react to the proposed European Union membership for Serbia. In the following days, Nikolić formed a parliamentary group with a number of other Radical Party representatives called &quot;Napred Srbijo&quot; (&quot;Forward, Serbia&quot;). Nikolić told the press that the &quot;old Serbian Radical Party no longer exists&quot;. On 11 September 2008, Šešelj addressed all Radical Party members in a letter. He named Nikolić and his group as &quot;traitors, Western puppets and agents&quot;. He also called upon all SRS members to remain loyal to the ideology of &quot;Serbian nationalism, anti-globalism and pro-Russian politics&quot;. On 12 September 2008, Nikolić and his group were officially ejected from the Radical Party. Nikolić announced that he would form his own party.

=== Serbian Progressive Party ===
On 24 September 2008, Nikolić announced that his new party&#x27;s name would be the Serbian Progressive Party and that the first convention would be held on 21 October. The founding congress of the new party was held on 21 October 2008.

On 5 February 2011, in front of the National Assembly, Nikolić and his political supporters – Milanka Karić (Strength of Serbia Movement), Velimir Ilić (New Serbia), Aleksandar Vulin (Movement of Socialists) and Aleksandar Vučić organised a protest demanding early parliamentary elections. According to an official Serbian police report there were around 55,000 people present. On 16 April 2011, Nikolić organised a larger protest with the same request. He also started a thirst and hunger strike that morning and later moved to the national parliament. He stated that his goal was to force the then-Serbian government (led by Boris Tadić) to hold early parliamentary elections. On 17 April, Tadić came to visit Nikolić in the latter&#x27;s parliamentary chambers. Tadić advised Nikolić to stop striking. Nikolić&#x27;s condition worsened, and he was taken to a private hospital. Serbia&#x27;s media regularly reported on his condition. That same night his arterial tension was high (150/100 mmHg) but he refused to seek intravenous therapy or medication. When he realised that his hunger strike would not bring about the desired outcome, Nikolić stepped down, citing Easter.

Nikolić led the party in the 2012 parliamentary election, and he ran for president in the 2012 presidential election. His slogan was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serbia Moving&quot; (, ). During the campaign, the issue of his education was raised, as the opposition claimed that Nikolić obtained his master&#x27;s degree under dubious circumstances in a private school. Nikolić responded by suing the daily newspapers &quot;Blic&quot; and &quot;Kurir&quot;, demanding 4 million euros as compensation.

On 6 May 2012, Nikolić lost the first round with 25.05% of the vote. Nikolić and incumbent Boris Tadić, who garnered 25.31% of the vote, faced off against each other in a runoff election on 20 May. Nikolić won, receiving 49.4% of the vote in a tally of 70% of the polling stations. Boris Tadić, his rival in the elections, congratulated him on the victory, and stated that he hoped that Serbia would continue its progress under Nikolić.

Nikolić resigned as leader of the Serbian Progressive Party on 24 May 2012, and simultaneously quit his membership in the party, citing the desire to be a president of all citizens of Serbia.

In a May 2012 interview, Nikolić was quoted by &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; to have said that ″Vukovar was a Serb city and Croats have nothing to go back to there″. Croatian President Ivo Josipović criticised Nikolić for this statement and conditioned future cooperation on Nikolić&#x27;s withdrawal of the statement.

The following day Nikolić&#x27;s office issued a statement saying that Nikolić never made any such statement and called it a ″treacherous lie″. However, Michael Martens, a journalist at &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; subsequently published the audio recording showing that Nikolić had indeed made that statement.

In late September 2013, the Belgrade pride parade was banned by the Serbian police for the third consecutive year following violent threats issued by right-wing groups and requests by the Serbian Orthodox Church. Prior to the parade, Dačić released a statement in which he said that homosexual behaviour was &quot;abnormal&quot; and that homosexuals in Serbia needed to &quot;respect the wishes of the majority of the population&quot; if the &quot;majority&#x27;s wish was for the parade to not take place.&quot; Nikolić subsequently issued a statement calling for &quot;work on the organisation of next year&#x27;s parade to begin immediately.&quot;

== Presidency (2012–2017) ==
Nikolić was inaugurated as the President of Serbia on 31 May 2012. Štefan Füle, the European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, was the highest-ranking official to attend and many ambassadors from other countries were also present. The leaders of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Macedonia, boycotted the inauguration due to his denial of the genocide in Srebrenica and claims about Vukovar. Nikolić&#x27;s advisors were Marko Đurić, Stanislava Pak, Oliver Antić, Milorad Simić, Radoslav Pavlović, Predrag Mikić and Jasmina Mitrović Marić.

On 2 June 2012, Nikolić stated on Montenegrin television that &quot;there was no genocide in Srebrenica. In Srebrenica, grave war crimes were committed by some Serbs who should be found, prosecuted and punished. [...] It is very difficult to indict someone and prove before a court that an event qualifies as genocide.&quot; Nikolić stated that he would not attend the annual commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre: &quot;Don&#x27;t always ask the Serbian president if he is going to Srebrenica, my predecessor was there and paid tribute. Why should every president do the same?&quot; His predecessor, Tadić, had previously acknowledged the massacre as a genocide.

Bakir Izetbegović, a member of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s presidency, said Nikolić&#x27;s comments insulted the survivors. He elaborated &quot;the denial of genocide in Srebrenica will not pave the way for co-operation and reconciliation in the region, but on the contrary, may cause fresh misunderstandings and tensions.&quot; Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, condemned his comments and stated that &quot;the EU strongly rejects any intention to rewrite history.&quot; The United States Department of State deplored Nikolić&#x27;s statement and considered them unfounded and counterproductive.

On 25 April 2013, Nikolić apologised for crimes committed by any individual in the name of Serbia, and, in particular, for crimes committed in Srebrenica. The apology was not well received by some media and politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina who were disappointed that Nikolić did not recognise the massacre as a genocide.

As President, Nikolić has decorated a large number of domestic and foreign individuals and institutions on the occasion of Statehood Day. In 2016, he honoured Omar al-Bashir, President of Sudan, because that country refused to recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence. The New York-based Coalition for the International Criminal Court called on Nikolić to revoke the medal he gave to Sudan&#x27;s president because Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is suspected of five counts of crimes against humanity, two counts of war crimes and three counts of genocide allegedly committed in Darfur.

In February 2017, Nikolić announced that he would not seek re-election in Serbia&#x27;s forthcoming elections and extended his support to Aleksandar Vučić.

== Controversies ==
=== Greater Serbia ===
During the 1990s and until 2008, Nikolić repeatedly called for the creation of a Greater Serbia. Nikolić told &quot;Večernje novosti&quot; in 2004 that the boundaries of Greater Serbia along the Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line were not part of any imperialistic politics, but would always remain a &quot;dream&quot; for him and other Radical leaders. He also said that he would not have diplomatic relations with Croatia because they are &quot;occupying Serbian land&quot;. In 2007, Nikolić stated that the basis of political action in the Serbian Radical Party was the unification of Republika Srpska, Montenegro, and the Republic of Serbian Krajina with Serbia in a single Balkan state. But a few days before the 2012 elections, Nikolić told the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; in an interview that the territorial integrity of neighbouring countries cannot be questioned and that his former opinions were no longer valid. When asked about this change of position, he quoted a French philosopher that said &quot;only a fool does not change his opinion.&quot; In 2018, Nikolić stated that he has supported the independence of Republika Srpska and unification with Serbia.

=== Education ===
In 2012, Nikolić was accused of buying a master&#x27;s degree from the Faculty of Management in Novi Sad without attending a single class or exam. The allegation was based on the fact that his diploma had no stamp and that no other students recalled having seen him attend classes or exams.

=== Comments about the protection of &quot;Serbian genes&quot; ===
On 25 January 2016, Nikolić laid the cornerstone for &quot;the Centre of Excellence&quot; of the University of Kragujevac, his hometown; the institution will include a stem cell research unit. Nikolić said The Stem Cell Bank will &quot;preserve what&#x27;s most important, and the most beautiful characteristics of the Serb people&quot; and also: &quot;Children should be born here, with the Serb genetic material, with the Serb code, Serb past and Serb future. That has guided me to support this&quot;. Ombudsman of Serbia, Saša Janković, reacted to this on Twitter by saying he &quot;regretted this statement,&quot; and adding that the first article of the Constitution states &quot;the Republic of Serbia is the state of the Serb people and all citizens who live in it.&quot; The League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV) also reacted, saying that the president made &quot;a Nazi statement&quot; that &quot;violated the Constitution,&quot; and urged him to resign.

=== Comments about gynaecology and women ===
In September 2016, At the opening ceremony of the Symposium of the Association of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians Serbia, Montenegro and Republika Srpska, Nikolić said: &quot;Gynaecology is knowledge about women, if anyone should dare to say that they have that knowledge&quot;. Maja Sedlarević, member of League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina (LSV), said Nikolić had offended women and also he is ignorant, uneducated and superficial.

<text>Ivica Dačić (, ; born 1 January 1966) is a Serbian politician serving as deputy prime minister of Serbia since 2022 and minister of internal affairs since 2024. He has been the leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) since 2006.

Dačić graduated from the University of Belgrade in 1989 and joined SPS in 1991. He quickly rose up the ranks of the party, becoming its spokesman in 1992, under his mentor, Slobodan Milosević, President of Serbia and FR Yugoslavia. After the fall of Milošević, he served as the minister of information in a transitional government from 2000 to 2001. Dačić became SPS party leader in 2006. Like his predecessor Milošević, he is regarded as a pragmatic leader willing to change views based on circumstance and has worked to reform the party. Dačić led SPS into a government with the Democratic Party (DS) in 2008, after which he became the first deputy prime minister and minister of internal affairs, roles which he served until 2012. The DS–SPS government reached an EU candidate status. After the 2012 parliamentary election, SPS formed a coalition government with the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS); Dačić was elected prime minister. The SNS–SPS government pursued the European Union to start formal negotiations for the accession of Serbia and he signed the Brussels Agreement on the normalisation of relations of governments of Serbia and Kosovo.

In 2014, he returned to being the first deputy prime minister and also became the minister of foreign affairs, roles which he served until 2020. Dačić was elected president of the National Assembly after the 2020 parliamentary election and was succeeded by Vladimir Orlić in 2022. Commentators described his political positions as populist and nationalist.

==Early life==
Dačić was born on 1 January 1966 in Prizren, which at the time was part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. Dačić was born to a Serbian family and was brought up in Žitorađa. His father, Desimir, was a police officer, and his mother, Jelisaveta (&quot;Jela&quot;), was a housewife. His parents were both born in villages under the Jastrebac. When Ivica was six months old, the family moved to Žitorađa. He has a sister, Emica. At the age of 5, he was featured in the newspapers in the article &quot;Enciklopedija u kratkim pantalonama&quot; (Encyclopaedia in shorts) as he had learnt to read and write himself, knew the names of many mountains, rivers and capitals, nearly all notable football players and results of matches.

His childhood nickname was &quot;Bucko&quot; and his classmates at secondary school in Žitorađa described him as very intelligent for his age - he reportedly managed to often amaze his teachers with his knowledge and wit. He played handball and football and associated with everyone at his school. In the state-run history-contest named &quot;Tito, revolucija, mir&quot;, which was held in all republics, Dačić won over 600 others. The family was described as humble and not wealthy, and as they lived off one paycheck, the parents picked mushrooms and dog rose in order to send Ivica and his sister to school. The parents sold the house in Žitorađa in 2010 and moved to Prokuplje, Desimir had until some years ago driven a 1977 Zastava 750.

He went to high school in Niš, where he excelled with the highest grades (5), and graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Political Sciences, with a degree in journalism in 1989, with a highest medium grade of 10, and also won the award for the best student of scientific achievements. His sister Emica has degrees in pedagogy and drama. He was in the faculty organisation Association of Communists, and in 1990 he was elected the first president of the Young Socialists of Belgrade.

==Political career==

===Early years===
At the beginning of the 1990s, he was an editor for the short-lived newspapers of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), &quot;Epoha&quot;. He became a member of SPS in the middle of 1991. He was the head of the Information and Propaganda staff of the SPS during the elections in 1992 and 1993, and then a minister of the Citizens&#x27; council in the first assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and member of the Executive Committee of the Main Board (IO GO) and Vice-President of the Council for Information and Propaganda of the SPS. He was appointed member of IO GO on the second congress of SPS on 26 October 1992, with the most won votes.

In the mid-1990s, Milošević&#x27;s wife Mirjana Marković moved Dačić to a small office in a Belgrade suburb in order to curb his growing ambitions. Dačić was appointed member of IO GO again in the next congress in 1996, when there were major personnel changes in the party leadership, and of 27 members of IO GO, voted in 1992, only 5 remained, including Dačić. He was the spokesman of SPS for 8 years, between 1992 and 2000. In 1996, Dačić was a minister in the Citizens&#x27; Council of the Assembly of Yugoslavia and President of the Committee on Public Information, and in 1997 he was member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In April 1999, the federal government appointed him a member of the Board of Tanjug, and in early May, as President of the Federal Council of the public institution RTV Yugoslavia.

===President of the SPS Main Board and 2004 elections===

He was elected President of the Belgrade Socialists on 10 February 2000, and again on 5 December 2000 in the election conference of the City Board of SPS. Following the Bulldozer Revolution on 5 October 2000, Milošević was arrested by Serbian police on 31 March 2001, and was eventually transferred to The Hague to be prosecuted by the ICTY.

In the transitional government, from October 2000 to January 2001, Dačić was the co-minister of Information alongside Biserka Matić (DOS) and Bogoljub Pejčić (SPO). On 24 September 2000 he was elected the minister of the Citizens&#x27; Council of the Assembly of Yugoslavia, and then member of the Committee on Security and Foreign Policy in both federal assemblies. Dačić reformed the party with his assembling of a team of young moderates, while retaining some of the former figures to satisfy the elderly ex-communists.

Dačić was the President of the Main Board of the SPS and was the Vice-President of the SPS from 2000 to 2003, and federal deputy in the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Assembly of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro from 1992 to 2004. In the sixth congress of SPS, on 18 January 2003, Dačić was elected the President of the Main Board of SPS. Since 2003, he was deputy in the parliament, and head of the parliamentary group of SPS.

He was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 2004 election and placed fifth with 125,952 votes (4,04%).

===Party leadership===
He was elected President of the Socialist Party on the seventh congress on 4 December 2006, winning over candidate Milorad Vučelić in the second round with 1,287 points, versus 792 points, of the delegates votes. In 2007, he was the President of the Committee on Security of the Parliament. On 7 July 2008, the government appointed Dačić the first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Police. He became a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).

In 2008, the Socialists were back in power as partners of the Democrats in the For a European Serbia-electoral alliance, led by Boris Tadić, after the 2008 Serbian parliamentary election; the Democrats were the main party that had helped oust Milošević. Dačić supported Serbia&#x27;s EU ambitions.

In August 2010, Dačić and his family were under police protection after threats by the Serbian mafia. In 2012, the Security Intelligence Agency (Serbia&#x27;s intelligence agency) received information that drug boss Darko Šarić had offered 10 million € to assassinate Tadić and Dačić.

===2012 elections, Prime Minister===

The Socialist Party entered a coalition with the Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS), and United Serbia. In the 2012 parliamentary election the Socialist Party&#x27;s coalition had come third with 556.013 votes, 14.53%, 44 seats; The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), led by Tomislav Nikolić, beat the Democratic Party of Tadić in both the parliamentary and 2012 presidential election. Of the results, Dačić said &quot;We have risen from the ashes&quot; after the Party had doubled their results from the previous election. After weeks of negotiations, the Socialist Party left the alliance with the Democrats in favour of the Serbian Progressive Party. Nikolić offered the Prime Minister post to Dačić, and on 28 June 2012, Dačić received a mandate to form a new Government of Serbia. Dačić assumed office on 27 July. He said at a reception: &quot;In this chamber there are many who toppled us in 2000, and I thank them, for if they hadn&#x27;t toppled us we wouldn&#x27;t have changed, realised our mistakes and we wouldn&#x27;t be standing here today.&quot;.

The government included the SPS and SNS, along with several smaller parties, headed by Nikolić, a former nationalist. The election has triggered some unease, as it marks the return of power of Milošević&#x27;s allies. Dačić has worked on transforming the party since taking over after Milošević, proclaiming a pro-EU path, and abandoning Milošević&#x27;s nationalist policies. The stagnant economy has resulted in Dačić set to forming a &quot;economic recovery council&quot; by the end of August. The Serbian parliament elected Jorgovanka Tabaković (SNS) as new central bank governor.

==Policies==
Upon becoming Prime Minister, he faced the challenges of a declining economy and Serbia&#x27;s accession to the EU. Speaking to Parliament, he said that unemployment and economic recovery were the state&#x27;s main priorities.

===Foreign relations===

He has said that Serbia will &quot;co-operate with all the countries of the world, advocate security, stability and good relations in the western Balkans and hold out its hand in reconciliation&quot;.

==== EU membership ====

Serbia earned EU candidate status under Tadić&#x27;s government, and Dačić has said that the new government will implement everything the previous government had accepted in the EU talks. Dačić supporters claim his pro-EU stance is evident in the handover of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić under his tenure as Interior Minister, and his role in the visa-free travel for Serbs in the EU. Following the European Council&#x27;s confirmation on 28 June 2013 that formal negotiations for the accession of Serbia to the EU could begin, Dačić announced that the Serbian government would remain continuously in session with the aim of completing the talks as quickly as possible. He emphasised that harmonisation with European laws is an integral part of the government&#x27;s plan for boosting investment and employment.

===Status of Kosovo===

On 17 February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo declared independence. It was the second declaration of independence by Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian-majority political institutions, the first having been proclaimed on 7 September 1990. The legality of the declaration, and indeed whether it was an act of the Assembly, was disputed by the government of Serbia. Serbia sought international validation and support for its stance, and in October 2008 Serbia requested an advisory opinion on the matter from the International Court of Justice. The Court determined that the declaration of independence was legal.

In 2006, upon being elected party leader, Dačić said that he had no problem fighting for Kosovo as he had done it before. Although the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia might not be a requirement for Serbia&#x27;s EU accession, the EU opposes any partition of Kosovo into ethnic entities. In May 2011, he said that partition of Kosovo would be the &quot;only realistic solution&quot;.

On 25 July 2011, the North Kosovo crisis began when the Kosovo Police crossed into the Serb-controlled municipalities of North Kosovo, in an attempt to control several border crossings without the consultation of either Serbia or KFOR/EULEX. Though tensions between the two sides eased somewhat after the intervention of NATO&#x27;s KFOR forces, they continued to remain high amid concern from the EU, who also blamed Kosovo for the unilateral provocation.

On 24 November 2011, Dačić said that he saw the Republic of Kosovo&#x27;s incident with Serbs in North Kosovo as an attack on Serbia. The BBC claimed the &quot;nationalist&quot; leanings of Kosovo-born Dačić raise speculation on the policy towards the Kosovo issue, which may implicate on Serbia&#x27;s EU application.

Dačić&#x27;s stance has since dramatically changed; in February 2013 he met Hashim Thaçi, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, in Brussels for the most important in a series of talks. On 19 April 2013, Dačić and his government took another step towards normalising relations between Kosovo and Serbia. In March 2013, Dačić said that while his government would never recognise Kosovo&#x27;s independence, &quot;lies were told that Kosovo is ours&quot; and that Serbia needed to define its &quot;real borders&quot;.

===Economy===
The Socialist-controlled gas monopoly Srbijagas which entered into partnership with Russian oil giant Gazprom during the coalition government with the Democratic Party. On 12 July, Dačić called the Serbian financial sector &quot;the greatest enemy of the people&quot;. The stagnant economy has resulted in Dačić set to forming a &quot;economic recovery council&quot; by the end of August. Dejan Šoškić was replaced as Governor of National Bank of Serbia by Jorgovanka Tabaković on 6 August 2012.

==Protege of Slobodan Milošević==
Because he was a high-profile spokesman for Milošević, he received the nickname &quot;Little Sloba&quot; after his mentor. Dačić said that the Socialist Party he inherited from Milošević made mistakes, but he still revered Milošević. He said, regarding his history with Milošević: &quot;The past is of no interest to me because I cannot change it but we can do something to change our country&#x27;s future.&quot;

Nenad Sebek, executive director of the Centre for Reconciliation and Democracy think-tank said &quot;Dačić is one of the most intelligent and cunning politicians in Serbia [...] Without ever saying sorry for what his party did during the
1990s under Milošević, Dačić single-handedly returned the Socialists to the political mainstream in Serbia.&quot; Sebek continued: &quot;He is extremely smart and likely to be very cooperative when negotiating with the international community, but he&#x27;s still an eyesore for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the memory of a goldfish.&quot;

The EU had earlier listed Dačić among persons in Milošević&#x27;s circle prohibited from entering the EU.

==Personal life==
Dačić&#x27;s wife is named Sanja Djaković Dačić. He has two children, a son named Luka and a daughter named Andrea. 
Dačić was a licensed amateur radio operator and former President of KK Partizan Sport Association of Serbia. He was also Vice-President of the Olympic Committee of FR Yugoslavia. He was appointed President of RK Partizan on 23 June 2007. His father, Desimir, died on 30 January 2018.

==Awards==

*&quot;Bambini&quot;, for his work on European integration in 2010, awarded in 2011 by the Association of Young Academics, Germany.

<text>Woodmont is a mansion and hilltop estate of in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998 for its well-preserved Chateau-style architecture.

==Alan Wood, Jr.==

Woodmont was designed in 1891 by Quaker architect William Lightfoot Price in the French Gothic style for Alan Wood, Jr., a steel magnate and former U.S. Congressman. Overlooking the Schuylkill River, the industrial town of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, and the Alan Wood Iron &amp; Steel Company plant, the chateauesque mansion was completed in 1894 at a cost of one million dollars ($37.8 million in 2023).

The site features views of 15 to 20 miles. The Schuylkill Expressway passes by the estate, hundreds of feet below.

The model for Woodmont was the George W. Vanderbilt mansion, Biltmore, in Asheville, North Carolina. Price had designed a nearby hotel for Vanderbilt, the Kenilworth Inn (1890–91), and was intimately familiar with the then-under-construction chateau.

Woodmont includes tennis courts, a swimming pool, stables, several outbuildings, greenhouses, a stream, and walking paths. The original property spanned more than , including a working farm with two dairy barns (one survives).

Alan Wood, Jr. occupied the estate for less than a decade. A year before his 1902 death, he sold it to his nephew, Richard G. Wood, who lived there for 28 years. Richard began subdividing the land in 1929, including the sale of to the Philadelphia Country Club.

A description from 1897:

WOODMONT.--Alan Wood, Jr., owns the estate with the above name. The section around the house, including the gardens, is styled Woodmont Park. The house was constructed between 1891 and 1894. William L. Price, of Philadelphia, being the architect. The style is that of a French Gothic chateau. Stone from the vicinity furnished most of the walls, the cellar being cut out of the rock. Lieperville stone, with limestone trimmings, were used in facing, and the stable is from the stone quarried from the cellar. The site is 475 feet above tidewater, overlooking the Valley of the Schuylkill for fifteen or twenty miles around. The highest site in Montgomery County is on the Woodmont Farm, being twenty-five feet higher than the mansion site. There are neat lodge-houses. Woodmont Farm contains about 100 acres, and Bellevue and Highland Farms, owned by Mr. Wood, adjoining, also contain about a hundred acres each. The Woodmont Farm had been owned by the Newberry family for a century before Mr. Wood purchased it in 1880. The Bellevue and Highland Farms were a part of the John Y. Crawford estate, and were bought from the estate by Mr. Wood in 1885. Highland Farm was well-named in old time from its elevated position. The farms are well-kept, and in the best condition. On Highland Farm was a stone mansion house, which Mr. Wood beautifully remodeled, and it has been rented to citizens yearly, furnished. Richard G. Wood, of Pittsburg , is dwelling there this summer. There is also a fine farm-house. The stone barn on Bellevue Farm is believed to be the finest one in Montgomery County, accommodating fifty cows and twenty-five horses; and hospital stalls are added for sick cows and horses for isolation.
==Father Divine==
The estate is today the center of the International Peace Mission movement. Father Divine, a self-proclaimed God and leader of the movement, was given the estate by a follower, John Devoute, in 1953. His followers renovated the mansion and placed an American flag prominently in front reflecting Father Divine&#x27;s patriotism. They also added a garden like those on previous Peace Mission properties. An open house was held on September 10–12, 1953.

Followers visited Father Divine here until his death in 1965. All furnishings in Divine&#x27;s rooms, including an antiquated television set, have been left as they were at his death. The estate is now a shrine to his life and a meeting place for his few remaining followers.

==Visiting==
Woodmont is open to the public on Sunday afternoons, from April to October. The guided tours are free of charge.

<doc id="717929" wikidata="Q890630" url="?curid=717929" title="Bogoljub Karić">
<text>Bogoljub Karić (, ; born 17 January 1954) is a Serbian businessman and politician.

==Early life and education==
Bogoljub was born to Janićije Karić and Danica Kuzmanović. He earned a degree in Geography at the University of Pristina and his Master&#x27;s Degree in economy at University of Niš. He married Milanka Babić and has four children Nebojša, Nadežda, Jelena and Danica. He is a brother of two siblings, Dragomir Karić and Olivera Karić Nedeljković.

==Career==
During the 1970s, Karić opened his own company &quot;Technicar&quot; which managed crop-growing tools. This led to the establishment of the first private factory in Eastern Europe under the name &quot;Kosovo Univerzum&quot;.

Afterwards, the Karić family grew their private company businesses into a large company known as The Astra (BK) Group. It encompasses numerous sectors including manufacturing, civil engineering and constructing, International wholesales export-import trading, telecommunications and electronic media, banking and finance, science and education and charitable activities.

In 1987 he established first private construction company in Moscow, in the then USSR.

In 2002, Karić created the Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Yugoslavia.

In 2006 he established another construction company named DANA HOLDINGS, a real estate, investment and development company of residential, industrial, commercial, educational and mixed-use projects as well as PPP investments in emerging markets.

Karić has written several research papers published in his country of origin and abroad. He has also authored books on private business, finance, and financial management.

In 2006, Karić fled Serbia to Russia after the Serbian Prosecutor&#x27;s Office began an investigation against him for alleged fake investments through his mobile operator Mobtel. He returned to Serbia in December 2016 after the investigation was dropped.

==Political and social activities==
Karić ran for President of Serbia in the June 2004 Presidential Election, polling nearly 20% of the vote.

Karić subsequently formed and registered his political party Strength of Serbia Movement (SSM) which participated in the local elections of September 2004. At these elections, the SSM, although formed barely a month before the elections, had a surprisingly good showing, established itself firmly in the center of the democratic bloc of political forces in Serbia. Its representatives, in coalition with other democratic forces were part of many municipal councils (including that of the capital Belgrade), and it had several deputies and ministers in the Provincial Government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.

As a new law on political parties became valid, Strength of Serbia Movement re-registered itself again in 2010 under the name Strength of Serbia Movement - BK. At that moment, SSM was in coalition with Tomislav Nikolić&#x27;s party, forming an opposition bloc for the next elections.

In 2017, he endorsed Aleksandar Vučić and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party in the Presidential elections.

==International sanctions==
On June 3, 2022, Bogoljub Karić was sanctioned by the EU authorities because he is believed to have close ties with the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko; and his company, Dana Holdings, is said to be the only non-government owned entity that provides the Belarusian regime with economical benefits. He is also blacklisted by Switzerland.

<doc id="717932" wikidata="Q1313540" url="?curid=717932" title="Safety curtain">
<text>A safety curtain (or fire curtain in America) is a passive fire protection feature used in large proscenium theatres. It is usually a heavy fabric curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch. Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely known. The safety curtain is sometimes referred to as an iron curtain (or iron) in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.

Occupational safety and health regulations state that the safety curtain must be able to resist fire for a short time to delay fires starting on stage from spreading to the auditorium and the rest of the theatre, to provide additional exiting time for audience members and members of staff.

The curtain is heavy and requires its own dedicated operating mechanisms. In an emergency, the stage manager can usually pull a lever backstage which will cause the curtain to fall rapidly into position. Alternatively, heat-sensitive components can be built into the rigging to automatically close the curtain in case of fire. It may be released electronically with the activation of the building&#x27;s fire alarm system. It can also be flown in and out, as regulations in some jurisdictions state that it must be shown to the audience, to prove its effective operation, for a certain amount of time during every performance.

A safety curtain is required per United States building codes if the proscenium wall is required to be fire rated. The curtain is required to demonstrate a fire rating of approximately 30 min per testing.

In the UK, it is a requirement that a safety curtain must be fully down within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. 

In 1794 the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane became the first theatre to install an iron safety curtain. Several other serious fires, including the 1887 Exeter Theatre Royal fire, led to the introduction of safety curtains on a wider scale. However, Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Lyceum Theatre, built in 1883, has also been described as the &quot;[first] theatre in Britain to be fitted with an iron safety curtain&quot;. 
A very early example of a safety curtain installation in the United States was at the New Fifth Avenue Theatre (New York City) which opened in 1873. Chicago&#x27;s 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire resulted in over 600 deaths when the theater&#x27;s safety curtain got stuck midway down, along with other structural deficiencies in the building.

==Related stage fire safety devices==

The safety curtain can be combined with other safety devices, such as:

*Smoke pockets - are steel channels located at either side of the proscenium arch that the safety curtain travels within to create a physical barrier between the auditorium and the stage. The safety curtain is not intended to create an air seal but rather prevent material from falling from the stage house into the audience.
*Fire doors - that automatically close any doorway onto the stage in the event of a fire. 
*Smoke vents - vents above the stage which will allow smoke to move out of the roof of the theatre, enabling safer evacuation of the audience. 
*Water curtain - sprinkler heads or other nozzles directly in front of the proscenium to prevent sparks from flying off the stage or to extinguish any burning material (such as a set) which may fall through the proscenium.

<text>Vladan Batić (; 27 July 1949 – 29 December 2010) was a Serbian lawyer and politician. He served as the Minister of Justice in the Government of Serbia from 2001 until 2004.

==Education and career==
He graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School, where he eventually obtained doctorate. In 2001, Batić announced that warrants would be issued for the arrests of persons removed from power during the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000 and who were suspected of misconduct through abuse of power. It was this campaign which eventually led to the surrender of Slobodan Milošević to police as an alternative to forced arrest, and the first step to his extradition to the ICTY.

In 2004 he ran for Serbian Presidency in the election. At the time of his death Batić was the President of the Christian Democratic Party of Serbia and since 2007 a Member of Parliament as a part of his party&#x27;s bloc formed with their coalition partner the Liberal Democratic Party.

Batić reappeared in international news media spotlight when he testified before a Nicosia court that billions of dollars belonging to the Serbia had been smuggled out of the country by the ousted Milošević administration during the UN sanctions on the country, by use of offshore corporations in Cyprus registered by the former law office of the Greek Cypriot leader, Tassos Papadopoulos. Batić had been pursuing the affair since 2002.

Batić died on 29 December 2010 from throat cancer.

<doc id="717934" wikidata="Q205884" url="?curid=717934" title="Circulating capital">
<text>Circulating capital includes intermediate goods and operating expenses, i.e., short-lived items that are used in production and used up in the process of creating other goods or services. This is roughly equal to intermediate consumption. Finer distinctions include raw materials, intermediate goods, inventories, ancillary operating expenses and (working capital). It is contrasted with fixed capital. The term was used in more specialized ways by classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx.

Where the distinction is used, circulating capital is a component of (total) capital, also including fixed capital used in a single cycle of production. In contrast to fixed capital, it is used up in every cycle (raw materials, basic and intermediate materials, combustible, energy…). In accounting, the circulating capital comes under the heading of current assets.

Building on the work of Quesnay and Turgot, Adam Smith (1776) made the first explicit distinction between fixed and circulating capital. In his usage, circulating capital includes wages and labour maintenance, money, and inputs from land, mines, and fisheries associated with production.

According to Karl Marx (second volume of Das Kapital, end of chapter 7) the turnover of capital influences &quot;the processes of production and self-expansion&quot;, the two new forms of capital, circulating and fixed, &quot;accrue to capital from the process of circulation and affect the form of its turnover&quot;. In the following chapter Marx defines fixed capital and circulating capital. In chapter 9 he claims: &quot;We have here not alone quantitative but also qualitative difference.&quot;

Conventionally, (physical) capital assets held by a business for more than one year are regarded in annual accounting statements as &quot;fixed&quot;, the rest as &quot;circulating&quot;. In modern economies such as the United States, roughly half of the intermediate inputs bought or used by businesses are in fact services, and not goods.

<text>A dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) is a class of drug which acts as a reuptake inhibitor of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine by blocking the action of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Reuptake inhibition is achieved when extracellular dopamine not absorbed by the postsynaptic neuron is blocked from re-entering the presynaptic neuron. This results in increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine and increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission.

DRIs are used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy for their psychostimulant effects, and in the treatment of obesity and binge eating disorder for their appetite suppressant effects. They are sometimes used as antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders, but their use as antidepressants is limited given that strong DRIs have a high abuse potential and legal restrictions on their use. Lack of dopamine reuptake and the increase in extracellular levels of dopamine have been linked to increased susceptibility to addictive behavior given increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission. The dopaminergic pathways are considered to be strong reward centers. Many DRIs such as cocaine are drugs of abuse due to the rewarding effects evoked by elevated synaptic concentrations of dopamine in the brain.

==Medical uses==
The following drugs have DRI action and have been or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone.

The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, which may or may not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine.

The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine.

The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, potentially more potently, as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (due to Yerkes–Dodson&#x27;s law, &#x27;more potently stimulated&#x27; may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates &amp; dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e., relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e., relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.

The wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil and its analogues (e.g., adrafinil, armodafinil) have been approved to treat narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder. These act as weak (micromolar) DRIs, but this effect does not correlate with wakefulness-promoting effects, suggesting the effect is too weak to be of clinical significance. The conclusion is that these drugs promote wakefulness via some other mechanism.

DRIs have been explored as potential antiaddictive agents in the context of replacement therapy strategies, analogous to nicotine replacement for treating tobacco addiction and methadone replacement in the case of opioid addiction. DRIs have been explored as treatment for cocaine addiction, and have shown to alleviate cravings and self-administration.

Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, including DRIs, have proven quite effective in managing excessive food consumption and regulating appetite in obese patients. Though such pharmacotherapy is still available, the majority of stimulant anorectics marketed for this purpose have been withdrawn or discontinued due to adverse side effects such as hypertension, valvulopathy, and drug dependence.

==Pharmacology==
DRIs may be divisible into two different types with different effects: (1) typical or conventional DRIs like cocaine, WIN-35428 (β-CFT), and methylphenidate that produce potent psychostimulant, euphoric, and reinforcing effects; and (2) atypical DRIs like vanoxerine (GBR-12909), modafinil, benztropine, and bupropion, which do not produce such effects or have greatly reduced such effects. Moreover, atypical DRIs are often dysphoric at high doses.

Typical DRIs may actually be acting as dopamine releasing agent (DRA)-like agents that have been referred to as dopamine transporter (DAT) &quot;inverse agonists&quot; rather than as simple competitive reuptake inhibitors (which is what atypical DRIs are proposed to be). Typical DRIs are similar to substrate-type DRAs in their effects on brain dopamine levels and in their subjective and behavioral effects.

In terms of maximal brain dopamine elevations, typical DRIs or DAT &quot;inverse agonists&quot; can increase levels by 500 to 1,500%, substrate-type DRAs by more than 1,000% (as high as 5,000% or more), and atypical DRIs or competitive reuptake inhibitors by less than or equal to 500%.

==History==
Until the 1950s, dopamine was thought to only contribute to the biosynthesis of norepinephrine and epinephrine. It was not until dopamine was found in the brain in similar levels as norepinephrine that the possibility was considered that its biological role might be other than the synthesis of the catecholamines.

==List of DRIs==
Only DRIs which are selective for the DAT over the other monoamine transporters (MATs) are listed below. For a list of DRIs that act at multiple MATs, see other monoamine reuptake inhibitor pages such as NDRI and SNDRI.

===Selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors===
* α-Pyrrolidinoisohexanophenone (α-PiHP) - very strong and very selective for the dopamine transporter, with little to no effect on the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters
* 4-Hydroxy-1-methyl-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-piperidyl 4-methylphenyl ketone
* Altropane (O-587)
* Amfonelic acid (WIN 25978)
* Amineptine (has a reasonable degree of selectivity for dopamine over norepinephrine reuptake inhibition)
* BTCP (GK-13), same acronym as for breakthrough cancer pain.
* 3C-PEP
* DBL-583
* Difluoropine (O-620)
* GBR-12783
* GBR-12935
* GBR-13069
* GBR-13098
* GYKI-52895
* Iometopane (β-CIT, RTI-55)
* Ethylphenidate (more selective for DA vs NE reuptake inhibition compared to methylphenidate, but still has a marked effect on both)
* Modafinil (relatively weak but very selective for the dopamine transporter, with little to no effect on the norepinephrine or serotonin transporters)
* Armodafinil (R-enantiomer of modafinil; somewhat more potent at inhibiting DAT than racemic modafinil, with equally negligible action on NET and SERT)
* RTI-229
* Vanoxerine (GBR-12909)

===DRIs with substantial activity at other sites===
* Amantadine (also a weak NMDA receptor antagonist)
* Benztropine (also muscarinic antagonist)

* Cocaine
* Fluorenol (extremely weak)
* Medifoxamine (relatively weak)
* Metaphit (irreversible; depletes dopamine)
* Methylphenidate (has a mild degree of selectivity for dopamine over norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, although it significantly affects both)
* Dexmethylphenidate (the dextro Diastereomer(R,R steriomer) of methylphenidate. Is theorized to be more potent (twice as potent on a milli-to-milli basis) than racemic methylphenidate)
* Nomifensine (Dual selective norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) is a drug used for the treatment of clinical depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and the management of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. 
* Phenylpiracetam
* Isopropylphenidate
* Rimcazole
* Venlafaxine (weak)

<doc id="717938" wikidata="Q5097252" url="?curid=717938" title="Chigwell Urban District">
<text>Chigwell was a local government district in south west Essex, England. It contained the settlements of Chigwell, Loughton and Buckhurst Hill; and formed part of the Metropolitan Police District.

==Formation==
It was created an urban district by a county review order on 1 October 1933 as the merger of the former area of:

*Buckhurst Hill Urban District (874 acres)
*Loughton Urban District (3,962 acres)
*Chigwell civil parish only, from Epping Rural District (4,135 acres)

==Development==
The district lay on the edge of the &quot;Greater London Conurbation&quot; and experienced a rapid population growth, in part caused by London County Council out-county construction at Loughton, the Urban District&#x27;s headquarters, and also in the south east of the district of the Hainault Estate (which also extended into neighbouring Ilford and Dagenham). Extensive council house building by the Chigwell Urban District itself took place between Buckhurst Hill and Loughton. 

In 1948, the New Works Programme of the London Passenger Transport Board brought the London Underground services of the Central line to six stations in the district; namely Roding Valley, Chigwell, Grange Hill, Buckhurst Hill, Loughton and Debden. The large LT Hainault depot was also mostly in the U.D.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms were granted in 1951 and represent &quot;Or, a stag at rest proper, on a chief gules three axe-heads bendwise sinister with blades down-words argent.&quot;

==Abolition==
The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London considered the entire district for inclusion in Greater London, however after strong local resistance, only a small area of around Hainault was transferred from the urban district and Essex to form part of the London Borough of Redbridge in Greater London in 1965. The population of this area in 1961 was 7,071.

On 1 April 1974 the remainder of the district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 and the area has since formed part of the Epping Forest District.

<doc id="717941" wikidata="Q895118" url="?curid=717941" title="Boulton and Watt">
<text>Boulton &amp; Watt was an early British engineering and manufacturing firm in the business of designing and making marine and stationary steam engines. Founded in the English West Midlands around Birmingham in 1775 as a partnership between the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton and the Scottish engineer James Watt, the firm had a major role in the Industrial Revolution and grew to be a major producer of steam engines in the 19th century.

==The engine partnership==

The partnership was formed in 1775 to exploit Watt&#x27;s patent for a steam engine with a separate condenser. This made much more efficient use of its fuel than the older Newcomen engine. Initially the business was based at the Soho Manufactory near Boulton&#x27;s Soho House on the southern edge of the then-rural parish of Handsworth. However most of the components for their engines were made by others, for example the cylinders by John Wilkinson.

In 1795, they began to make steam engines themselves at their Soho Foundry in Smethwick, near Birmingham, England. Between 1775 and 1800, Boulton and Watt produced 496 engines. The partnership was passed to two of their sons in 1800. William Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76. The firm lasted over 120 years, albeit renamed &quot;James Watt &amp; Co.&quot; in 1849, and was still making steam engines in 1895, when it was sold to W &amp; T Avery Ltd.

For ten years their banker in London was Charlotte Matthews after her husband died in 1792. A woman banker was unusual but she became a close confidante, holidaying with Boulton, and she lent them enormous sums to fund their endeavours. When she died aged 43 in 1802 her business was run by the Boulton and Watt families.

The business trained young engineers who went on to achieve notability. Among the names which were employed there in the eighteenth century were James Law, Peter Ewart, William Brunton, Isaac Perrins, William Murdoch, and John Southern.

==Archive==

The firm left an extremely detailed archive of its activities, which was given to the city of Birmingham in 1911 and is kept at the Library of Birmingham. An additional archive was donated to the Boulton and Watt collection in 2015 including a thesis. The archive contains: Display folders containing text and varieties of drawings.

==Preserved operational engines==
*Smethwick Engine, Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, manufactured 1779.
*Whitbread Engine, Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, manufactured 1785, bore, stroke.
*Crofton Pumping Station manufactured 1812, bore, stroke.
*Kew Bridge Steam Museum manufactured 1820, bore, stroke.
*Papplewick Pumping Station two engines, manufactured 1884, bore, stroke. Believed to be the last engines manufactured by the company.

<text>There are 64 state parks, nine state recreation areas, nine state waysides, and 23 state trails in the Minnesota state park system, totaling approximately . A Minnesota state park is an area of land in the U.S. state of Minnesota preserved by the state for its natural, historic, or other resources. Each was created by an act of the Minnesota Legislature and is maintained by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. The Minnesota Historical Society operates sites within some of them. The park system began in 1891 with Itasca State Park when a state law was adopted to &quot;maintain intact, forever, a limited quantity of the domain of this commonwealth...in a state of nature.&quot; Minnesota&#x27;s state park system is the second oldest in the United States, after New York&#x27;s.

Minnesota&#x27;s state parks are spread across the state in such a way that there is a state park within of every Minnesotan. The most recent park created is Lake Vermilion State Park, created in 2010. The parks range in size from Franz Jevne State Park with to Saint Croix State Park with . Two parks include resources listed as National Natural Landmarks (Big Bog State Recreation Area and Itasca State Park) and six parks encompass National Historic Landmarks (Charles A. Lindbergh, Fort Snelling, Mille Lacs Kathio, St. Croix, Soudan Underground Mine, and Split Rock Lighthouse State Parks). 52 sites or districts across 34 Minnesota state parks are on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), including 22 parks with developments constructed by New Deal-era job creation programs in the 1930s.

== History ==
Minnesota&#x27;s first attempt to create a state park came in 1885, when a park was authorized to preserve Minnehaha Falls. The effort was delayed by legal appeals from the various landowners of the desired parkland, and by the time those were settled in favor of the state in 1889, Minnesota no longer had the money to purchase the land. Instead the city of Minneapolis fronted the cash. Owned and operated by Minneapolis, Minnehaha State Park was ultimately absorbed as a city park.

Minnesota tried again in 1891, authorizing a state park around Lake Itasca both for its recreational opportunities and to protect the source of the Mississippi River. Interstate Park on the St. Croix River was created in 1895. Other sites were added over the next two decades, but with an inconsistent vision. Modest tracts of scenic land were acquired in Minneopa and Jay Cooke State Parks, but much effort was also expended on creating historical monuments relating to the Dakota War of 1862 and the Great Hinckley Fire. Moreover, most of the sites were being administered by the state auditor, who had many other duties. Itasca State Park, meanwhile, was being administered as a state forest. In 1923, state auditor Ray P. Chase excoriated this situation, calling for wiser selection of park lands and a dedicated commissioner. Chase&#x27;s comments had an impact, and two years later the &quot;Department of Conservation&quot; was created to manage the state&#x27;s natural resources, including the state parks. Originally part of the forestry division, the state parks received their own division in 1935 to take advantage of federal programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In 1971, the department became the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

The state parks were closed for almost three weeks in July 2011 due to a shutdown of the state government.

== State parks and recreation areas ==
== State waysides ==
The state park system includes nine waysides, most of them along Minnesota State Highway 61 on the North Shore. These are parcels of land too small to be full-fledged parks, but with cultural or natural resources greater than would be overseen by the Minnesota Department of Transportation as highway waysides. Generally development is limited to a parking area and a short trail; sometimes there are sanitation facilities and picnic tables as well.
== State trails ==
=== Future trails ===
Since Minnesota state parks and trails are authorized by the state legislature, some trails have been established in state statute, yet no usable mileage has been constructed.

== Former parks ==
Several units added to the Minnesota state park system over the years have since been redesignated or transferred to other agencies, including the system&#x27;s very first unit, Camp Release State Memorial Wayside, created in 1889. In most cases these decisions were due to the unit being too small for a state park with little chance of expansion, or largely local use rather than attracting visitors from all over the state and beyond. Four of these units were redesignated as state waysides and are listed above. The other former units were:

<text>Harry Aubrey Woodruff Burl (24 September 1926 – 8 April 2020) was a British archaeologist best known for his studies into megalithic monuments and the nature of prehistoric rituals associated with them. Before retirement he was Principal Lecturer in Archaeology, Hull College, East Riding of Yorkshire. Burl received a volume edited in his honour. He was called by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the leading authority on British stone circles&quot;.

Burl&#x27;s work, while considering the astronomical roles of many megalithic monuments, was cautious of embracing the more tenuous claims of archaeoastronomy. In &quot;Prehistoric Avebury&quot; Burl proposed that Circles and Henge monuments, far from being astronomical observatories for a class of &quot;astronomer priests&quot; were more likely used for ritualistic practices, connected with death and fertility rites, and ancestor worship, similar to practices observed in other agricultural cultures (in particular the rituals of Native North American Tribes such as the Algonquin and the Pawnee). Rituals would have been performed at key times of the year, such as the Spring Equinox and Summer Solstice, to ensure a successful harvest from the land.

His approach led him to question what he saw as the over-romanticised view that Stonehenge was built from bluestones hauled by hand from the Preseli Hills in south west Wales to Salisbury Plain. In his view, the stones had been left close to the site by earlier glaciers and then exploited by the monument&#x27;s builders. Others have argued that the bluestones have been traced to only the Preseli Hills through their chemical signature and that they could not have come from elsewhere. Additionally, it has been claimed that there was no known glacier with a course linking the hills with Salisbury Plain or a glacier from anywhere that reached far enough south. On the other hand, research by earth scientists shows that glacier ice reached the Scilly Isles on at least one occasion, and that ice which passed through Pembrokeshire did cross the coasts of Somerset and Devon.

Burl died in April 2020 at the age of 93.

==History==
The University of Wisconsin–River Falls was founded in 1874 as River Falls State Normal School, one of the state normal schools created to prepare students for teaching careers and to provide better education to the state&#x27;s frontier regions. In 1927, the school was renamed River Falls State Teachers College, as the state normal schools became &quot;State Teachers Colleges&quot; that incorporated a significant increase in general education offerings and four-year courses of study leading to a Bachelor of Education degree.

After World War II, thousands of returning veterans in Wisconsin under the G.I. Bill needed more college choices for their studies and educational advancement. Because of popular demand, the Regents of the State Teachers College system allowed the teacher training institutions to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in liberal arts and fine arts. In 1951, when the state teachers colleges were organized as &quot;Wisconsin State Colleges&quot;, the school name was changed to Wisconsin State College–River Falls, and the school offered a full four-year liberal-arts curriculum. In 1964, it was renamed Wisconsin State University-River Falls when state colleges were all granted university status.

The school became a member of the University of Wisconsin System in 1971 when the former University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin State University system merged. It then became the University of Wisconsin–River Falls.

<text>Lucille Loretta Wall (January 18, 1898 – July 11, 1986) was an American actress who played the role of Lucille March Weeks on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1963 to 1976. When Wall was ill in 1975, the role was played by Mary Grace Canfield, who was a quarter-century younger than Wall. Wall returned to the show for infrequent guest appearances over the years, the last in 1982.

==Early years==
Wall was born in Chicago, Illinois. Actress Geraldine Wall was her sister, and she had another sister, Mildred. During her teenage years, Wall leaned toward a career in music, but she eventually turned toward radio for her career.

==Stage==
Wall was active with a stock theater company headed by actress and playwright Jane Cowl. She also &quot;had several seasons on Broadway.&quot;

==Radio==
Wall debuted on radio on WJZ in 1927, using the name Polly Preston as she acted on &quot;Collier&#x27;s Hour&quot;.

Using her own name, she had the title role on the radio soap opera, &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot; (1944-1951). She simultaneously played the role of Belle Jones on the radio soap opera &quot;Lorenzo Jones&quot;. She also portrayed Winifred Wilbur in &quot;Your Family and Mine&quot; and had the title role in &quot;The Adventures of Barbara Wayne&quot;. Wall also acted in &quot;Pretty Kitty Kelly&quot;, &quot;Island Boat Club&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;True Confessions&quot;, &quot;The First Nighter&quot; and &quot;A Tale of Today&quot;.

==Death==
Wall died at a convalescent home in Reno, Nevada, on July 11, 1986, at age 88.

<doc id="717981" wikidata="Q56522" url="?curid=717981" title="Hixkaryana language">
<text>Hixkaryana is one of the Cariban languages, spoken by just over 500 people on the Nhamundá River, a tributary of the Amazon River in Brazil. It is one of around a dozen languages that are described as having object–verb–subject word order (initially by linguist Desmond C. Derbyshire).

==Phonology==

Hixkaryana has the following consonant phonemes:
* is a retroflex tap with a lateral release.

Hixkaryana has the following vowel phonemes:

==Grammar==

In Hixkaryana, arguments are indexed on the verb by means of person prefixes. These prefixes form an inverse-like pattern in which the argument highest in the hierarchy 2nd &gt; 1st &gt; 3rd is indexed on the verb. If the object of a transitive verb outranks the subject according to this hierarchy, the appropriate O-prefix is used; otherwise, an A-prefix is used.

Intransitive verbs take prefixes mostly similar to the transitive prefixes given above, with an active–stative. The arguments&#x27; grammatical number is indexed on the verb by means of portmanteau suffixes that combine tense, aspect, mood, and number.

In most cases, the person prefixes unambiguously determine which of the arguments is the subject and which is the object. When both the subject and the object are third person, however, the person prefix is inadequate to fully determine the identity of the arguments. In these situations, therefore, word order is crucial in determining their identity. Hixkaryana may have an object–verb–subject word order. The example below, &quot;toto yonoye kamara&quot;, cannot be given the AVO reading &quot;the man ate the jaguar&quot;; the OVA reading – &quot;the jaguar ate the man&quot; – is the only possible one.

Indirect objects, however, follow the subject:

Moreover, the word order in non-finite embedded clauses is SOV. Like most other languages with objects preceding the verb, it is postpositional.

<text>The Saab Formula Junior was a car built in 1960 by the Swedish car maker Saab.

In 1960, the Saab 93F was being replaced by the Saab 96 and a new 841 cc engine was developed. The competition and testing departments of Saab did not want to see any series produced sports engines with the new size until they had a chance to try some new ideas. These ideas led to the creation of these Formula Junior race cars with which Saab surprised the motor racing world in the late autumn of 1960. The cars first showed up at the Gelleråsen racetrack at Karlskoga and then at the Eläintarhanajot race in Helsinki (Finland), in 1961, finishing 4th and 5th.

The body design was unusual. Instead of using a multi-tubular spaceframe chassis like other &quot;Formula Junior&quot; cars, Saab chose to construct an advanced aluminium monocoque car, with a plastic nose-cone.

The fibreglass nose protected a &#x27;bored-out&#x27; horizontal 950 cc three cylinder two stroke engine, with two dual Solex carburettors developing some 95 bhp - (one of the carburettors was cut in half, thus providing three chokes — one for each of the three cylinders). There was a cross-flow radiator, for cooling. The suspension was purpose-built, incorporating a unique type of tensile spring. The cars did not do very well in races, due to their cornering ability and their relatively low-powered engine (the later regulations allowed up to 1100 cc engines). Nonetheless, two first places and a track record (Stockholm) were achieved. The 70%-30% front-rear weight distribution created pronounced understeer. This was only partially overcome by designing the rear suspension to encourage the inside rear wheel to lift during cornering. Only two cars were built, as later regulations made them even less competitive. They were retired at the end of the 1961 racing season. History records them as having fulfilled an important developmental role for Saab&#x27;s competition department.

The cars appeared in typical Swedish livery of blue and yellow. The drivers were Gösta Karlsson, Carl-Magnus Skogh and Erik Carlsson.

<text>Barrio Bellavista (&quot;Bellavista Neighborhood&quot;) is an area that lies between the Mapocho River and San Cristóbal Hill in Santiago, Chile. It is known as Santiago&#x27;s bohemian quarter, with numerous restaurants, boutiques, avant-garde galleries, bars and clubs. Many of the city&#x27;s intellectuals and artists live in Bellavista, and Pablo Neruda&#x27;s house in Santiago, &quot;La Chascona&quot;, is in the district. The area is served by the Baquedano Metro subway station, located across the river to the south.

Bellavista is a popular place to purchase craftwork made from lapis lazuli, a semiprecious stone found principally in Chile and Afghanistan. On weekends, there is an evening handicrafts market that runs the length of Pío Nono. Another attraction is the Santa Filomena Parish also known as the Parroquia de Santa Filomena. The National Zoo of Chile is located at the entrance of San Cristóbal Hill.

<text>Frances Payne Bolton (née Bingham; March 29, 1885 – March 9, 1977) was an American politician from the Republican Party. She served in the United States House of Representatives, and was the first woman elected to Congress from Ohio.

In the late 1930s, Bolton took an isolationist position on foreign policy, opposing the Selective Service Act in 1940 which introduced the draft, and opposing Lend-Lease in 1941. During the war she called for desegregation of the military nursing units, which were all-white and all-female.

In 1947 she sponsored a long-range bill for nursing education, but it did not pass. When the draft was resumed after the war, Bolton strongly advocated the conscription of women. Pointing to their prominent role during the war, she said it was vitally important that women continue to play these roles. She saw no threat to marriage, and argued that women in military service would develop their character and skills, thus enhancing their role in the family. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton supported the United Nations, especially UNICEF, and supported the independence of African colonies.

==Early life==
She was born on March 29, 1885, in Cleveland, Ohio, as Frances Payne Bingham. She was the daughter of Charles William Bingham (1846–1929) and Mary Perry (née Payne) Bingham (1854–1898). Her siblings included Oliver Perry Bingham, William H. Bingham, Elizabeth Beardsley (née Bingham) Blossom, and Henry Payne Bingham.

Among her maternal family members was uncle Nathan P. Payne (the former mayor of Cleveland), Oliver Hazard Payne (who worked for Cleveland based Standard Oil and was a trustee for the Standard Oil Trust), and aunt Flora Payne (the wife of U.S. Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney). Her maternal grandfather was wealthy U.S. Senator Henry B. Payne.

She was educated at private schools in Cleveland, New York City, and in Paris.

==Career==
Active in public health, nursing education and other social service, education, and philanthropic work, she succeeded her husband, Chester C. Bolton, in office a few months after his death in 1939. Upon election to the remainder of her late husband&#x27;s term, Bolton refused the customary widow&#x27;s allowance comprising the remainder of the salary her late husband would have collected had he served out his term. She represented the 22nd District, mostly consisting of Cleveland&#x27;s eastern suburbs. Bolton served an additional fourteen terms, serving alongside her son, Oliver P. Bolton, for three of those terms. She and Oliver appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as the only mother and son serving together. It was reported that when he voted against her, she once stage-whispered, &quot;That&#x27;s my &quot;adopted&quot; son.&quot;

A confidential 1943 analysis of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office described Bolton as

Serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton called Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in May 1954 after the fall of the French base at Dien Bien Phu, urging him to invite nurse Genevieve de Galard to the United States. When Galard arrived in July, Bolton described her as a &quot;symbol of heroic femininity in the free world&quot;. After receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Galard was received at a dinner for three hundred in Congresswoman Bolton&#x27;s home district of Cleveland while on a tour of the country.

Bolton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

===House Foreign Affairs Committee===
In 1955, she became the first American woman member of Congress to head an international delegation, using her own resources to fund it. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee&#x27;s subcommittee on Africa, she felt it was her responsibility to visit as much of Africa as possible. Arriving in Senegal on September 1, she spent the next six weeks crisscrossing the continent by plane, train, boat, and car. Her important stops included Liberia, Ghana (then still known as the Gold Coast), the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa, and Ethiopia. She met with leading nationalists such as Kwame Nkrumah, powerful politicians such as Haile Selassie, and leading women such as the Queen Mother of the Tutsis. She also spent a lot of time during her trip visiting schools and talking with young people, and meeting with women from all walks of life in the markets or clinics. As someone with a lifelong interest in education and health care, she prioritized these issues during her African travels.

When she got back to the United States she submitted a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled &quot;Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955.&quot; This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton&#x27;s trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.

In addition to influencing US relations with Africa, another of Bolton&#x27;s most lasting achievements was sponsoring legislation to purchase property across the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. This prevented commercialization of the area and preserved its appearance as it was when Washington lived there. Bolton had a phenomenal relationship with her constituents of Italian-American heritage and was known for mailing government child-care pamphlets to homes where new children were born. The nursing school at Case Western Reserve University is named in her honor for her accomplishments and generosity in the field of public nursing.

===Later life===
After rising to become ranking minority member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton was defeated in a bid for a sixteenth term in 1968 by Charles Vanik. She was, until Louise Slaughter&#x27;s continued service in 2012, the oldest woman to serve in the House of Representatives. Bolton retired to her family home, Franchester (named for herself and her late husband), in Lyndhurst, Ohio.

==Personal life==
In 1907, Frances Payne Bingham married Chester Castle Bolton (1882–1939). Together, they were the parents of four children:

* Charles Bingham Bolton (1909–1976), a dentist who developed the &quot;Bolton Standards of Craniofacial Growth&quot;.
* Kenyon Castle Bolton (1912–1983), a philanthropist and patron of the arts who married Mary Idelle Peters of Lancaster, Ohio.
* Oliver Payne Bolton (1917–1972), who also served in the U.S. House of Representatives.
* Elizabeth Bolton (1919–1919), who died in infancy.

She died in Lyndhurst, Ohio, on March 9, 1977, and was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

===Legacy===
She was a devotee of yoga. The Bolton Fellowship supports research in parapsychology.

Bolton and her husband donated land adjacent to their estate in 1922 to create the campus of Hawken School in Lyndhurst, Ohio. Her sons attended the private country day school.

Her papers are held at the Western Reserve Historical Society.

The school of nursing at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland is named Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing in her honor.

<text>Jon Ferguson &quot;Jay&quot; Mohr (born August 23, 1970) is an American actor, stand-up comedian, and radio host. He is known for playing film producer Peter Dragon in the TV comedy series &quot;Action&quot; in 1999, Professor Rick Payne in the TV series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; from 2006 to 2008 and the title role in the CBS sitcom &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot; from 2008 to 2010. He was also a featured cast member on the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1993 to 1995.

Since making his feature film debut with &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), Mohr has appeared in films such as &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; (1997), &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; (1998), &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; (1999), &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), &quot;Speaking of Sex&quot; (2001), &quot;Seeing Other People&quot; (2004), &quot;Even Money&quot; (2006), &quot;Dumbbells&quot; (2014) and &quot;Air&quot; (2023).

Mohr hosts his own podcast &quot;Mohr Stories&quot; on the SModcast Network and, since September 2015, hosted &quot;Jay Mohr Sports&quot;, a daily midday sports radio talk show on Fox Sports Radio. Mohr left Fox Sports Radio in January 2016 to pursue acting ventures. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award as the inaugural host and executive producer of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; (2003–2006).

==Early life==
Mohr was born in Verona, New Jersey, to Iva Jean (née Ferguson), a nurse, and Jon Wood Mohr, a marketing executive. He has two sisters, Julia and Virginia. He is of Scottish descent. Mohr was raised Presbyterian, but later converted to Roman Catholicism. He graduated from Verona High School in 1988. In high school, he was on the wrestling team and served as its captain during his senior year. Soon after graduating high school, Mohr was part of the cast of &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; at the Nutley Little Theater in Nutley, New Jersey.

==Career==

===Acting ===
After appearing on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Half Hour Comedy Hour&quot; show on April 2, 1991, MTV offered him a job hosting music videos as a VJ, which Mohr turned down. Instead, Mohr ended up hosting the lip-sync contest game show &quot;Lip Service&quot; on MTV, which earned him a CableACE Award. He then appeared as a featured player for the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. His memoir, &quot;Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live&quot;, details this tumultuous period of his life, including his battle with chronic panic attacks. He later credited his &quot;SNL&quot; co-star Sarah Silverman with saving his life by helping him treat the problem. Mohr&#x27;s account of his voluntary departure from SNL has been widely discounted, however. He was under a cloud of suspicion due to his admitted plagiarism of jokes during the season and his multi-year contract with NBC did not allow him to unilaterally quit.

Mohr had a recurring role in the first season of &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; as Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s brother, Wayne. Mohr&#x27;s first major film role was in 1996 when he played the conniving Bob Sugar, a sleazy sports agent in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, followed in 1997 by a starring role in &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; with Jennifer Aniston. In 1999, Mohr starred in the television series &quot;Action&quot;, in which he played sleazy film producer Peter Dragon. He was the voice-over artist for Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Glory&quot;. Mohr appeared in additional movies including &quot;Suicide Kings&quot;, &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;, and &quot;The Groomsmen&quot;. Mohr was offered a late night talk show job by Michael Eisner, but he declined, instead convincing Eisner to let him host a talk show on ESPN, &quot;Mohr Sports,&quot; which ran briefly in 2001 before being cancelled. The talk show job Mohr passed was then offered to Jimmy Kimmel and became &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

In 2003 and 2004, Mohr created, hosted, and was executive producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; reality television program. The show aired for three seasons, but was cancelled near the end of the third season due to poor ratings, only to be renewed later. Mohr was very vocal toward NBC concerning its cancellation and did not return for the show&#x27;s fourth season in 2006. Mohr was replaced with new host Anthony Clark, but was credited as a consultant. On the season finale of &quot;Last Comic Standing 4&quot;, Mohr performed as a guest comedian. His recurring role on the TV series &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; developed into a regular role. He appeared in &quot;My Own Private Practice Guy&quot;, a 2003 episode of the sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot;, and in three episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2004 in the recurring role of Taylor Reid. Parts of Mohr&#x27;s stand up was featured in Comedy Central&#x27;s animated series &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;. In 2005, he and his Giraffe Productions company inked a deal with Sony Pictures Television.

Mohr starred as newly divorced father Gary Brooks, the title character, for two seasons on the CBS sitcom &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot;. Paula Marshall played his ex-wife. In January 2010 he took the role as Billy in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Hereafter&quot;. He also guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Outlaw&quot; in 2010.

He has an upcoming starring role alongside Tom Blyth in the comedy &quot;Discussion Materials&quot; adapted from Bill Keenan&#x27;s memoir of the same name.

===Radio===
Mohr has contributed frequently to &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot; and often guest-hosted the program. Mohr finished in 7th place in the 2007 Smack-Off, 6th place in the 2008 Smack-Off, 10th place in the 2009 Smack-Off, 6th place in the 2010 Smack-Off, and 6th place in the 2011 Smack-Off. Mohr is also known to do &quot;drive-by&quot; call-ins to the show, typically to promote one of his stand-up shows or live events.

On January 2, 2013, Mohr replaced Rome on Fox Sports Radio, as he hosts a daily talk show titled &quot;Jay Mohr Sports&quot; in Rome&#x27;s longtime 12 to 3 p.m. (ET) timeslot, as Rome moved his show from Premiere Networks (the distributor of Fox Sports Radio) to CBS Sports Radio. The show can be heard on several internet platforms and regional affiliates. On November 3, 2014, Jay Mohr Sports moved to the 3 to 6pm time slot, so Rich Eisen could take over the 12-3pm slot on Fox Sports Radio.

===Podcast===
Mohr hosted his own podcast, titled &quot;Mohr Stories,&quot; on the SModcast Network, On May 4, 2012, Mohr announced his amicable departure from the SModcast network. He has since begun hosting &quot;Mohr Stories&quot; on his own network, Fake Mustache Studios.

<text>Christian Jules LeBlanc (born August 25, 1958) is an American television actor. He is best known for playing the role of Michael Baldwin on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1991 to 1993, 1997 to present). He has received nine Daytime Emmy Award nominations and three wins for his work on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

== Early life ==
LeBlanc was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His father is retired Major Andre Victor LeBlanc, a decorated veteran and winner of the Bronze Star. He is the second of eight children. He was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a renovated plantation house on the banks of the Mississippi River. While researching his family&#x27;s genealogy, LeBlanc found that his grandmother was legally a slave and his mother was Creole.

He began acting in high school, when a girl talked him into auditioning for a school production of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. He was cast as a Shark. He then played a beggar in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof,&quot; where his classmate, future New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, also had a role.

He graduated with honors from Tulane University, majoring in ancient history and pre-med.

==Career==
While in college, LeBlanc was noticed by a photographer while swimming at a pool, which led to modeling and acting opportunities. He worked at a variety of jobs to support himself early in his career, including as a busboy at Helmsley Palace, where his boss was Leona Helmsley. He also had jobs as a teacher and a caterer.

He was offered a role in a PBS series, &quot;Edit Point.&quot; He was then cast as Kirk McColl on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, playing the role from 1983 to 1985. After leaving &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, he had a regular role on &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. He guest-starred on &quot;E.A.R.T.H. Force&quot;, &quot;Cheers, Riptide&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Fire&quot;.

LeBlanc was cast on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Michael Baldwin in 1991 and played the role until 1993. After a short absence, he returned in 1997 and has been with the show ever since. He also played Michael in crossover episodes on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 2005. He has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for the role nine times, and won for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2005, 2007, and 2009.

In 1993, he appeared in a &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV Movie. He was also cast in the Showtime late-night cable TV series &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, and reprised the role for a video movie.

LeBlanc starred on stage in &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in 1995, co-starring with Julie Harris. The play was directed by Charles Nelson Reilly, who was also his acting coach. His other theater credits include productions of &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;, &quot;The Catonsville Nine&quot;, and &quot;Appearances to the Contrary&quot;.

In 2000, LeBlanc produced and acted in a short film, &quot;Puppy Love&quot;, co-starring with Grace Zabriskie. The film won Outstanding Short Film at the Los Angeles and New York International Short Film Festivals.

LeBlanc appeared alongside his &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; wife, Tracey E. Bregman, in the video for &quot;I Keep On Loving You&quot; by Reba McEntire in 2010. From 2011 to 2014, he played Jake on the web series &quot;.&quot;

LeBlanc acted in and produced the 2013 film &quot;Grave Secrets&quot;, co-starring with Diane Ladd and Ashley Jones. A television episode version of the film aired as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Deadtime Stories&quot; on Halloween. LeBlanc&#x27;s role was edited out of the television version.

In 2022, he starred Off-Broadway in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; at Theatre at St. Clements, co-starring with Sonoya Mizuno and Matt de Rogatis. In March 2024, LeBlanc and de Rogatis reprised their roles, bringing the production to the 2024 Tennessee Williams &amp; New Orleans Literary Festival.

== Personal life ==

LeBlanc&#x27;s art work has been displayed in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Washington, D.C.

He is not related to actor Matt LeBlanc, who played Joey Tribbiani on the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. 

On June 20, 2021, he revealed on Maurice Benard&#x27;s Youtube series &quot;State of Mind&quot; that he is gay and has been married to his husband since 1993.

In October 2023, LeBlanc announced that he had been diagnosed with Multiple myeloma in June of that year and that the cancer was in remission. He had first noticed symptoms on the set of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and took time off while receiving treatment.

<doc id="718012" wikidata="Q2470296" url="?curid=718012" title="Inner Harbor">
<text>The Inner Harbor is a historic seaport, tourist attraction, and landmark in Baltimore, Maryland. It was described by the Urban Land Institute in 2009 as &quot;the model for post-industrial waterfront redevelopment around the world&quot;. The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum.

The name &quot;Inner Harbor&quot; is used not just for the water but for the surrounding area of the city, with approximate street boundaries of President Street to the east, Lombard Street to the north, Greene Street to the west, and Key Highway on the south. The harbor is within walking distance of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium. A water taxi connects passengers to Fells Point, Canton, and Fort McHenry.

==History==

While Baltimore has been a major U.S. seaport since the 18th century, the historically shallow water of the Inner Harbor prior to its manipulation through dredging was not conducive to large ships or heavy industry. These were concentrated in Locust Point, Fell&#x27;s Point, and Canton.

In the mid-20th century, Baltimore suffered from the economic decline of restructuring common to many industrial cities in the United States. Old harbors were abandoned with the arrival of container ships after World War II. Later, the old harbors were adapted as focal points to reconnect cities with their waterfronts, and develop public spaces, tourism, business, and housing.

During the 1940s, John H. Threadgill, the head of the Steamship Trade Association, initiated a study for a cross-harbor bridge. A bridge across the Inner Harbor of Baltimore was one idea that was discussed frequently. In his capacity as head of the association, Threadgill ultimately recommended that the idea for a cross-harbor bridge be abandoned, due to the fact that Baltimore relied heavily on a shipping trade and fears that the bridge would negatively impede the flow of shipping traffic at the Port of Baltimore. Threadgill was named head of Baltimore&#x27;s Port Commission during the 1950s.

In the 1950s, economic changes ended both the freight and passenger use of the Inner Harbor, such as the Old Bay Line&#x27;s steamers. Rotting warehouses and piers were eventually torn down and replaced by open, grass-covered parkland that was used for recreational purposes and occasional large events.

The waterfront was gradually transformed with award-winning parks and plazas surrounded by office buildings, hotels and leisure attractions, which reversed the city&#x27;s decline and became a model for urban renaissance in cities around the world. The renewal of Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor area began with the adoption of the Charles Center project by the City Council and Mayor Thomas D&#x27;Alesandro in March 1958. Between 1958 and 1965, Baltimore renewed the center of its business district by rebuilding Charles Center with office buildings, hotels, and retail shops.

At the beginning of mayor Theodore R. McKeldin&#x27;s second term in 1963, the redevelopment program was expanded to include surrounding the Inner Harbor. Corporate headquarters and hotels were built around the shoreline of the Inner Harbor. A public park and promenade were added for leisure activity and community gatherings.

On July 4, 1976, following the rendezvous of Tall Ships in New York for the U.S. Bicentennial, eight ships from other nations visited Baltimore, where they attracted a huge number of tourists. This interest helped spur the development of other tourist attractions – including the National Aquarium, Maryland Science Center, and the Harborplace festival marketplace (operated by The Rouse Company), which opened on July 4, 1980. The nearby Baltimore Convention Center and Hyatt Regency Baltimore Hotel added to the services and resulted in population density and visitors.

With the success of the Inner Harbor in the 1970s and 1980s, Baltimore became a worldwide tourist destination and model of urban planning and development. It influenced more than 100 other cities and won more than 40 national or international awards, including a citation by the American Institute of Architects in 1984 as &quot;one of the supreme achievements of large-scale urban design and development in U.S. history&quot;.

In recent years, the area along the waterfront to the east of the Inner Harbor (in the direction of Fells Point and Little Italy) has been developed with condominiums, retail space, restaurants, and hotels – an ongoing project known as Harbor East.

While little development land remains around the Inner Harbor, the available land has been subject to many plans, which have not been realized. Recently completed projects include mixed-use developments incorporating office space, street-level retail, and condominiums, as well as hotel projects such as the Ritz Carlton Residences, a condominium project on Key Highway at the southeast corner of the Inner Harbor.

In September 2003, the Inner Harbor area was flooded by Hurricane Isabel. The Baltimore World Trade Center remained closed for a month, but all the other buildings were saved from flooding by the Inner Harbor development controls, which were created by the master developer team of Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management, Inc.

In March 2004, a water taxi capsized during a storm on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River near Fort McHenry. While occurring over a mile downstream of the Inner Harbor, the accident was associated with the Inner Harbor by news reports and casual observers. Five passengers died in the accident, which the National Transportation Safety Board determined was caused when the small pontoon-style vessel encountered unpredictable strong winds and waves.

==Free speech==

As a central and busy part of Baltimore, the Inner Harbor has been the site of much political and artistic activity. The city is involved in ongoing disputes over free speech in the area. One early conflict concerned marchers for gay rights, whose permit was revoked by the city. (The city announced that only five or fewer people could march, and that they could not carry signs.)

The Rouse Company, which began operating Harborplace in 1980, has long been in conflict with street performers. The company regulates performances, and has often been accused of suppressing free speech. These disputes came to a head in 2002–2003, when two events triggered a lawsuit against the city.

===ACLU lawsuit===
On October 21, 2002, street performer Jerry Rowan was banned from the area for making an &quot;insensitive&quot; joke. Discussing the then-current D.C. sniper case, Rowan said: &quot;I was driving downtown this morning, and on the radio I heard that they&#x27;ve finally come out with a composite of the sniper, so there should be an arrest forthcoming. Apparently, he&#x27;s a white guy that speaks Spanish and looks like he&#x27;s Arab.&quot; Police officers overheard the joke and reported it to Rouse. The company had previously sent a letter to Rowan admonishing him for &quot;off-color humor&quot;, as well as &quot;lack of respect for program administrators&quot;. After this report, the company banned him from the area.

On April 4, 2003, a police officer asked Baltimore&#x27;s Women in Black to disband. The group had (and has) gathered in McKeldin Square every Friday since September 11, 2002.

Rowan and the Women in Black filed suit against the city of Baltimore on October 7, 2003, arguing their right of free speech. They were assisted by attorney Rajeev Goyle on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The lawsuit was resolved in 2013 in a settlement that resulted in a consent decree with the city, creating &quot;instant permits&quot; for spontaneous demonstrations and waived permit requirements for groups of 30 people or less. The negotiations with the ACLU, the city, The Rouse Company, and The Waterfront Partnership in the settlement yielded other specific results in favor of free speech activities. McKeldin Square, Rash Field, Kaufman Pavilion, the area West of the Visitor Center, and Area 10 were all designated as official free-speech zones. Additionally, the settlement required the City of Baltimore to pay the attorney&#x27;s fees for the ACLU.

Elsewhere, police enforce rules against protest. On May 21, 2011, teacher Bruce Friedrich was threatened with arrest while handing out animal rights pamphlets. On September 18, 2011, police arrested artist Mark Chase for selling his paintings &quot;in or near&quot; the Inner Harbor amphitheater. &quot;Your constitutional rights have nothing to do with the law,&quot; said the arresting officer when Chase objected on First Amendment grounds.

<doc id="718019" wikidata="Q445511" url="?curid=718019" title="Michael Walzer">
<text>Michael Laban Walzer (born March 3, 1935) is an American political theorist and public intellectual. A professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, he is editor emeritus of the left-wing magazine &quot;Dissent,&quot; which he has been affiliated with since his years as an undergraduate at Brandeis University, an advisory editor of the Jewish journal &quot;Fathom,&quot; and sits on the editorial board of the &quot;Jewish Review of Books.&quot;

He has written books and essays on a wide range of topics—many in political ethics—including just and unjust wars, nationalism, ethnicity, Zionism, antisemitism, economic justice, social criticism, radicalism, tolerance, and political obligation. He is also a contributing editor to &quot;The New Republic&quot;. To date, he has written 27 books and published over 300 articles, essays, and book reviews in &quot;Dissent&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Harpers&quot;, &quot;Quillette&quot;, and many philosophical and political science journals.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family on March 3, 1935, Walzer graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Brandeis University in 1956 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. He then studied at the University of Cambridge on a Fulbright Fellowship (1956–1957) and completed his doctoral work at Harvard University, earning his Doctor of Philosophy degree in government under Samuel Beer in 1961.

==Work==
Walzer is usually identified as one of the leading proponents of the communitarian position in political theory, along with Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael J. Sandel. Like Sandel and MacIntyre, Walzer is not completely comfortable with this label. However, he has long argued that political theory must be grounded in the traditions and culture of particular societies, and has long opposed what he sees to be the excessive abstraction of political philosophy.

His most important intellectual contributions include &quot;Just and Unjust Wars&quot; (1977), a revitalization of just war theory that insists on the importance of &quot;ethics&quot; in wartime while eschewing pacifism; the theory of &quot;complex equality&quot;, which holds that the metric of just equality is not some single material or moral good, but rather that egalitarian justice demands that each good be distributed according to its social meaning, and that no good (like money or political power) be allowed to dominate or distort the distribution of goods in other spheres; and an argument that justice is primarily a moral standard within particular nations and societies, not one that can be developed in a universalized abstraction.

In &quot;On Toleration&quot;, he describes various examples of (and approaches to) toleration in various settings, including multinational empires such as Rome; nations in past and current-day international society; &quot;consociations&quot; such as Switzerland; nation-states such as France; and immigrant societies such as the United States. He concludes by describing a &quot;post-modern&quot; view, in which cultures within an immigrant nation have blended and inter-married to the extent that toleration becomes an intra-familial affair.

==Employment==
Walzer was first employed in 1962 in the politics department at Princeton University. He stayed there until 1966, when he moved to the government department at Harvard. He taught at Harvard until 1980, when he became a permanent faculty member in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study.

In 1971, Walzer taught a semester-long course at Harvard with Robert Nozick called &quot;Capitalism and Socialism&quot;. The course was a debate between the two philosophers: Nozick&#x27;s side is delineated in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974), and Walzer&#x27;s side is expressed in his &quot;Spheres of Justice&quot; (1983), in which he argues for &quot;complex equality&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In April 2008, Walzer received the prestigious Spinoza Lens, a biennial prize for ethics in the Netherlands. He has also been honoured with an emeritus professorship at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study. He was elected to a Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 1971, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1990, and to a Corresponding Fellowship of the British Academy in 2016.

==Personal life==
Walzer is married to Judith Borodovko Walzer. They are parents of two daughters: Sarah Esther Walzer (born 1961) and Rebecca Leah Walzer (born 1966). His grandchildren are Joseph and Katya Barrett and Jules and Stefan Walzer-Goldfeld.

Walzer is the older brother of historian Judith Walzer Leavitt.

<doc id="718021" wikidata="Q1088341" url="?curid=718021" title="Chronophilia">
<text>Chronophilia are forms of romantic preferences and/or sexual attractions limited to individuals of particular age ranges. Some such attractions, specifically those towards prepubescents and those towards the elderly, constitute types of paraphilia. The term was coined by John Money and has not been widely adopted by sexologists, who instead use terms that refer to the specific age range in question. An arguable historical precursor was Richard von Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s concept of &quot;age fetishism&quot;. Importantly, chronophilia are technically not determined by age itself, but by human sexual maturity stages, such as body type, secondary sexual characteristics and other visible features, particularly as measured by the stages of the Tanner scale.

==Preferences based on age==

*Romantic and/or sexual attraction to minors
**Pedohebephilia refers to an expansion and reclassification of pedophilia and hebephilia with subgroups, proposed during the development of the DSM-5. It refers more broadly to sexual attractions. Under the proposed revisions, people who are dysfunctional as a result of it would be diagnosed with pedohebephilic disorder. People would be broken down into types based on the idea of being fixated on one, the other or both of the subgroups. The proposed revision was not ratified for inclusion in the final published version of DSM-5.
***Infantophilia (sometimes called &quot;nepiophilia&quot;) is a subtype of pedophilia describing a sexual attraction on children less than 5 years old (including toddlers and infants).
***Pedophilia is a psychological disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a romantic and/or sexual attraction to prepubescent youth. (Around 5-12 years of age) According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), pedophilia is a paraphilia in which a person has intense sexual urges towards children, and experiences recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about children. Pedophilic disorder is further defined as psychological disorder in which a person meets the criteria for pedophilia above, and also either acts upon those urges, or else experiences distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence. The diagnosis can be made under the DSM or ICD criteria for persons age 16 and older.
**Attraction to adolescents
***Hebephilia is a romantic and/or sexual attraction on early-pubescent youths in Tanner Stages 2 and 3 (around ages 9–14). 
***Ephebophilia is a romantic/sexual attraction on late-pubescent youths in Tanner Stage 4 (around ages 14–21). The term &quot;hebephilia&quot; was introduced by Bernard Glueck in 1955. Ephebophilia is not classified as a paraphilia, due to overlaps with teleiophilia and overlaps and similarities between Tanner Stages 4 and 5. Forensic psychologist and sexologist Dr. Michael Seto has noted &quot;&quot;older adolescents are reproductively viable and the fact that typically men are attracted to older adolescents, as reflected in self-report, psychophysiological, and pornography use studies (Freund, Seeley, Marshall, &amp; Glinfort, 1972; Symons, 1979)&quot;.
*Attraction to adults
**Teleiophilia (from Greek &quot;téleios&quot;, &quot;full grown&quot;) is a romantic and/or sexual preference for adults (around 18 to late 30&#x27;s early 40&#x27;s), specifically for adult body types, as it encompasses attraction towards postpubertals, the sexually mature. Dr. Michael Seto states: &quot;A sexual preference in those in late adolescence who show many signs of sexual maturity (Tanner stage 4) or who are sexually mature (Tanner stage 5) is not representative of hebephilia; instead, it can be described as ephebophilia or teleiophilia (Hames &amp; Blanchard, 2012).&quot; The term was coined by Ray Blanchard in 2000 and has seen less public adoption than some newer terms.
**Mesophilia (derived from the Greek &quot;mesos&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;) is a romantic and/or sexual preference for middle-aged adults (around late 40&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s). The term was coined by Michael Seto in 2016.
**Gerontophilia is a romantic and/or sexual preference for the elderly. (70&#x27;s+)

<doc id="718025" wikidata="Q1290054" url="?curid=718025" title="Raiden (video game)">
<text>is a 1990 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed by Seibu Kaihatsu and published by Tecmo in Japan. The game&#x27;s story takes place in the year 2090, when an alien species known as the Crystals invaded Earth. Players assume the roles of the Vanquish Crystal Defense pilot duo, taking control of two state of the art Fighting Thunders aircraft to defeat the Crystals and save the Earth.

The game was conceived after &quot;Dynamite Duke&quot;, Seibu Kaihatsu&#x27;s prior title, failed to sell as well as expected. During development, the game was designed as a vertically scrolling shooter due to the popularity of the genre at the time. Cheaper arcade hardware had to be used due to financial constraints caused by &quot;Dynamite Duke&quot;&#x27;s poor sales.

Although Seibu doubted &quot;Raiden&quot;&#x27;s success, it managed to sell 17,000 arcade units worldwide, helping to recuperate the company&#x27;s investments through word-of-mouth. The title became a critical success, with its most lauded features being the graphics, music, gameplay and co-operative play.

Due to the success of &quot;Raiden&quot;, several sequels and related games were made. &quot;Raiden&quot; was ported to home computers and various home video game consoles in the early to mid 1990s. The game was released as part of several compilations and through download services such as PlayStation Network. The ports received mixed to positive reception.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Raiden&quot; is a vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up game consisting of eight stages of increasing difficulty. In each stage, the player maneuvers the Fighting Thunder craft, engaging various enemies and avoiding their attacks. In cooperative play, both players can generate special projectiles that damage enemies by shooting the other player craft. After completing the eighth and final stage, the player returns to the first stage with the difficulty increased.

Collectible items include bombs, which cancel out enemy fire and deal damage over a wide area; weapon power-ups; and score-increasing medals. There are two bonus collectible items: the Miclus (a boss in Seibu Kaihatsu&#x27;s 1985 title &quot;Wiz&quot;) and a fairy that releases power-up items when the player dies. When the player dies, the fighter&#x27;s shrapnel become projectiles that damage enemies. If all lives are lost during a gameplay session, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Upon continuing, the player will start at the last checkpoint reached.

== Plot ==
The story of &quot;Raiden&quot; takes place in the year 2090, when a species of alien lifeforms known as the Crystals invaded Earth. The Crystals took control over most of Earth&#x27;s military hardware to use in the invasion. In response, the world organization known as Vanquish Crystal Defense (VCD) develops the Fighting Thunder attack craft, a cutting-edge weapon based on Crystal technology. To survive against the invaders and fight back, VCD deploys Fighting Thunder as the only hope for humanity.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
According to graphic designer and current MOSS CEO Toshinobu Komazawa, the creation of &quot;Dynamite Duke&quot; gave Seibu Kaihatsu the opportunity to begin developing &quot;Raiden&quot;, as the former did not sell as well as Seibu had hoped. In order to recoup the costs of developing &quot;Dynamite Duke&quot;, the decision was made to develop a shoot &#x27;em up instead of a sequel to it. Komazawa noted that the development of &quot;Raiden&quot; had a negative outlook, but an earnest beginning, since the shoot &#x27;em up genre was &quot;relatively inexpensive to produce&quot; games for, as well as increasing in popularity at the time. Due to financial constraints, the company opted to use arcade hardware less powerful than those used in their previous titles. Seibu could only afford to develop a shoot &#x27;em up with their development budget, with the project becoming a financial decision, as they had no other choice of game to make. Seibu took production notes from the overseas market, borrowing ideas from popular titles such as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;1942&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot; from Namco, and &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; by Toaplan.

The production of &quot;Raiden&quot; was led by Seibu Kaihatsu president Hitoshi Hamada, while Tetsuya Kawaguchi served as its designer and programmer K. Kondo and S. Mori were the other programmers. Komazawa, H. Matsuo, T. Matsuzawa and T. Wada were responsible for creating the in-game artwork. Y. Segawa was responsible for creating the arcade hardware. Near the end of development, Komazawa praised the programmers at Seibu for being able to produce a high-quality game on less powerful hardware.

=== Audio ===
The music for &quot;Raiden&quot; was composed by Akira Sato. A &quot;Raiden/Raiden II&quot; soundtrack was published by INH Co., Ltd. It includes soundtracks from &quot;Raiden&quot; (Arcade, PlayStation), &quot;Raiden Densetsu&quot; (FM Towns), &quot;Raiden II&quot; (Arcade, PlayStation) and &quot;Raiden DX&quot; (Arcade) as well as other extras.

== Release and ports ==
&quot;Raiden&quot; was first released in the arcades in April 1990 by Tecmo in Japan. It was distributed in North America by Fabtek, Taiwan by Liang HWA Electronics, South Korea by IBL Corporation, and Hong Kong by Wah Yan Electronics. The game was ported to various platforms, with each port featuring several changes and additions. In 2022, the arcade version will be included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console.

The PC Engine conversion was developed by A.I Company and first published by Hudson Soft in Japan on 22 November 1991, and released a few months later on the North American TurboGrafx-16 by NEC Technologies. It is a mostly faithful port of the arcade original.

The Atari Jaguar version was developed by Imagitec Design, then released in North America in November 1993. The North America, Europe and Japan releases were distributed by Atari Corporation and Mumin Corporation in 1994 respectively. It features various presentation and gameplay changes from the original arcade version.

The MS-DOS port was coded by Nigel &#x27;Freddy&#x27; Conroy, Steve Cullen and Martin Randall, and spearheaded by Martin Hooley at Imagitec. It shares the same visual design as the Jaguar conversion with the addition of a full-screen display. Its differences from the Jaguar port include support only for FM sound. It was released only in North America in 1994.

A handheld version was developed by BlueSky Software and launched for the Atari Lynx across North America and Europe in 1997 by Telegames, long after the Lynx&#x27;s commercial lifespan had ended. It was only available through direct order and a few select retailers.

=== &quot;Raiden Trad&quot; and &quot;Raiden Densetsu&quot; ===
The FM Towns release was titled &quot;Raiden Densetsu&quot; (&quot;Legend of Raiden&quot;) in Japan, while both the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System ports were given the name &quot;Raiden Trad&quot; across all regions (&quot;Trad&quot; being an abbreviation of &quot;&quot;, an alternative meaning of &quot;&quot;). Each version of &quot;Trad&quot; was developed and distributed by different developers and publishers. A European release of the Mega Drive version was planned for release by UbiSoft as part of a multi-game licensing deal with Bignet, but was never officially released in the region.

=== &quot;Super Raiden&quot; ===
&quot;Super Raiden&quot; is a PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version of the TurboGrafx-16 HuCard port. Its main new feature is the use of Redbook CD Audio for an arranged soundtrack, along with additional stages exclusive to the CD version. It was developed by A.I Company and released on 2 April 1992, in Japan by Hudson Soft.

=== &quot;The Raiden Project&quot; ===
: &quot;See main article:&quot; &quot;The Raiden Project&quot;
Both the original &quot;Raiden&quot; and &quot;Raiden II&quot; were included as part of &quot;The Raiden Project&quot; compilation. The included games are based directly on the original arcade releases and offers several options not found in other ports. The &quot;Project&quot; version of the first &quot;Raiden&quot; was re-released by HAMSTER Corporation as a stand-alone PlayStation title for their &quot;Arcade Hits&quot; series. It was later available as a digital download on the Japanese PlayStation Network store, playable on the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable.

=== Re-releases ===
&quot;Raiden&quot; was first adapted on mobile phones by Com2uS in 2004. The original game was later included as part of the 2012 compilation &quot;Raiden Legacy&quot; by DotEmu for mobile devices, PCs and other platforms. &quot;Raiden Legacy&quot; also includes the three games in the &quot;Raiden Fighters&quot; sub-series. On July 1, 2021, the arcade version of the game got ported for modern consoles as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

=== Cancelled ports ===
An Amiga version was announced in late 1993 to be under development by Imagitec Design. It was intended to be published by U.S. Gold, but according to a former Imagitec employee on an Amiga-dedicated internet forum, it was left unreleased due to the arrival of newer systems on the market. Another version was made by Imagitec for the Atari Falcon, announced in 1994. Early playable builds of both versions have since been leaked online.

== Reception ==

===Arcade===
The original arcade release of &quot;Raiden&quot; did not make as much money initially, with Komazawa attributing this to the game&#x27;s underpowered hardware and lack of flashy visuals to draw players in. A few months after its release, the game began to generate increased income, resulting in an increase in arcade establishments requesting orders of the hardware. Seibu Kaihatsu ended up selling around 17,000 units through steady sales for a year.

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the title on its 1 July 1990 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit at the time, outperforming titles such as &quot;Trigon&quot; and &quot;Columns&quot;. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1990 and fifth highest-grossing arcade game of 1991.

It was also an arcade hit for Fabtek in North America, where it became a chart-topper. During November and December 1990, weekly coin drop earnings averaged $194.25 per arcade unit.

&quot;Raiden&quot; was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

===Jaguar===
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Atari Jaguar version an average of 6 out of 10. The four reviewers agreed that it was virtually identical to the arcade version, but were divided about the quality of the game itself. Two of them described &quot;Raiden&quot; as &quot;above average&quot;, and two described it as mediocre, saying that the ship moves too slow, enemy fire often blends in with the background, and the graphics are subpar given the Jaguar&#x27;s capabilities. &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly criticized that the gameplay is outdated, the ship moves too slow, and that the graphics do not live up to the Jaguar&#x27;s potential. They concluded that &quot;a snoozer like &quot;Raiden&quot; just seems out of place on a powerful system like the Jaguar&quot;. The Jaguar version has sold more than 22,000 copies since its release as of 1 April 1995, though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime.

== Legacy ==
The success of &quot;Raiden&quot; resulted in several sequels and spin-offs across multiple platforms. Seibu Kaihatsu developed the &quot;Raiden&quot; games until they went bankrupt in 2005. Japanese developer MOSS, formed by Seibu Kaihatsu&#x27;s development staff, purchased the rights to the series, with their first release being &quot;Raiden III&quot; in 2005. In 1994, the game&#x27;s trademark was abandoned.

<text>, real name , is a character and one of the protagonists of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series of action-adventure stealth video games. Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa, Raiden was introduced in the series as the main player character of the 2001 game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, he appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit FOXHOUND and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a young rookie, he is later revealed to have been a child soldier in his native Liberia. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in the 2008 game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, in which he is assisting the series&#x27; main protagonist Solid Snake in his fight against Revolver Ocelot&#x27;s forces. He is also the main character of the 2013 game &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from private military companies.

Raiden, who was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories and a fan&#x27;s letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Kojima&#x27;s desire to see Snake from a different point of view. His inclusion in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players&#x27; reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked him, the character was redesigned for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot; and its reboot &quot;Revengeance&quot; to portray a darker side of his character. Raiden is voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi in Japanese and Quinton Flynn in English.

Raiden&#x27;s debut role as the protagonist of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; was controversial, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by Snake&#x27;s removal and that Raiden was appealing. Despite the initial mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role in the game, as well as his later &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; redesign and more for his role and design in &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;.

==Character design==
===Initial concept===

According to series creator Hideo Kojima, the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; stemmed from the developer&#x27;s desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden&#x27;s character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels in which the narrator is Dr. Watson rather than Holmes. Kojima said that while Raiden was the playable character, Snake was still the game&#x27;s true protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a &quot;weak-looking character&quot; but decided to follow Kojima. The codename &quot;Raiden&quot; was based on that of the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden, a historical combat aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. It was initially planned to be written in katakana as &quot;ライデン&quot;, but was changed to the kanji form &quot;雷電&quot; because of a resemblance to Bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;Laden&quot; in katakana, &quot;ラーディン&quot;. His full name was going to be &quot;Raiden Brannigan&quot; but the idea was scrapped. The romantic relationship between Raiden and Rosemary was inspired by Kojima&#x27;s experiences; their names, Jack and Rose, are a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet&#x27;s lead characters in the film &quot;Titanic&quot;. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, Raiden is considered to be a representation of the player through the experiences between the player and the character during the game.

Kojima conducted a survey among Japanese women about their views on certain video games. One respondent stated that she was tired of the main characters being &quot;old men&quot;. Kojima took her complaint into consideration, and Raiden was designed by artist Yoji Shinkawa to be more appealing to the preferences of Japanese women. Some Western gamers thought Raiden had an effeminate appearance, however Shinkawa said this perception is wrong, and that Raiden&#x27;s appearance is that of a handsome young man. Raiden&#x27;s outfit—the Skull Suit—was difficult to design until the staff decided on a &quot;bonelike&quot; concept. Shinkawa wanted to make Raiden sexually appealing, emphasizing the tightness of his clothing. The design of Raiden&#x27;s underwater rebreather mask was inspired by ancient mystical ninjutsu, where the ninja bites a scroll in the mouth during magic transformations. Raiden&#x27;s final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus&#x27; back and sever the backbone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead, Raiden would slice Solidus&#x27; stomach, another idea taken from samurai. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus&#x27; vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.

Konami kept Raiden&#x27;s starring role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; secret until the game&#x27;s North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized. The surprise to fans that Raiden was not Snake was admitted by Kojima to have been inspired by the plot twist of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; where the titular character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger was not a villain in that movie. Raiden&#x27;s appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game&#x27;s release in North America. Kojima said that Raiden was not supposed to be the focus of the storyline, even if he was the main character, and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t do a good enough job of conveying that&quot; to the player.

===Further development===
Raiden&#x27;s new design for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa was surprised by the way he illustrated Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden&#x27;s debut in the game&#x27;s trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden&#x27;s screenshots. Shinkawa and Kojima initially wanted to reincarnate Gray Fox for Metal Gear Solid 4, but scrapped him for Raiden, who they &quot;adored&quot; and wanted to expand with another game. In designing him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden&#x27;s beauty and sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was given the ability to wield swords with his own legs, giving the players the impression he was a ninja. Raiden&#x27;s first fight against Vamp in the game caused motion and voice actors difficulty because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. Two actors were selected for the motion capture of Raiden; one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences. Raiden&#x27;s fights in &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot; were made to assist the weaker Solid Snake and appealed to previous fans of the series who disliked the character. Because Raiden became a more active character in &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;, Kojima expressed a desire in him returning in a future character as playable.
When &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot; was known as &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot;, former producer Shigenobu Matsuyama hinted that Raiden&#x27;s past as a child soldier would be elaborated upon and his weaknesses as a human would be explored. Matsuyama wanted Raiden to have as strong a role in the game as in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, leading him to become its main character. Director Mineshi Kimura wanted Raiden to be able to move the way he did in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; trailers, wanting to show &quot;the stealth of the sword, and the strength of not even losing to the gun, and the fear and power you have with this blade&quot;. Matsuyama said they would focus on Raiden&#x27;s strong will and physical strength so he would be enjoyable to control. Raiden&#x27;s design was changed during the game&#x27;s development, leading to different promotional images of him. Following the game&#x27;s reboot into a spin-off, developers stated that while Raiden &quot;has grown up&quot; in comparison to previous &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games, he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in the First Liberian Civil War, leading him to become a &quot;hero with a dark past&quot;. Shinkawa later discussed with Platinum Games&#x27; Kenji Saito about including his quasi-human look. Raiden&#x27;s loss of an eye also represents his transformation across the story while also comparing him with the previous antagonist Solidus Snake. Tamari also explained that the cybernetic functions Raiden has were based on research led by the University of Texas. In response to complaints that &quot;Rising&quot; appeared to contradict Raiden&#x27;s ending in &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;, the Kojima Productions staff said the game would explain what happened with Raiden&#x27;s life. While Steven Armstrong was the game&#x27;s final antagonist, the character of Jetstream Sam was developed to be Raiden&#x27;s rival, something Shinkawa and fellow designer Kenichirou Yoshimura worked together to make both of them contrast each other through their visual appearances.

The team in charge of &quot;Revengeance&quot; depicted Raiden as a more mature character than in his previous appearances; they said his swordplay is not based on any samurai and that Raiden&#x27;s cybernetic body includes heels because they enable his style of swordplay, where he wields weapons with his feet. When developing the game&#x27;s, the team thought of Raiden&#x27;s revenge against his enemies, which resulted in the title &quot;Reveangeance&quot;. Writer Etsu Tamari expressed joy in the final product and expected that in the future, the team could make another game focused on Raiden. In a further analysis of how to write Raiden in &quot;Revengeance&quot;, Tamari stated he needed a new character that would bring him support in the form of the dog-like robot named Bladewolf; similar to how Snake guides Raiden in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, the mature Raiden acts like a mentor to Bladewolf across the story resulting in his character arc. Writer Etsu Tamari wanted to portray Raiden as a more mature person who wishes to take Snake&#x27;s footsteps. Atsushi Inaba wanted the gameplay of &quot;Revengeance&quot; fit Raiden&#x27;s style of characterization, resulting in the use of parries rather than defense. Inaba felt honored to work in &quot;Revengeance&quot; due to how he was able to see a more mature version of the character to the point of wishing for a sequel.

Raiden wears a for his missions in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. This suit monitors Raiden&#x27;s biological functions and relays this information to the Sons of Liberty. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; Raiden&#x27;s entire body below the upper jaw is replaced with a prototype cybernetic body. His original cybernetic body is replaced with a black one that also covers the left eye for &quot;Revengeance&quot;. Although proficient at all types of weaponry, Raiden specializes in wielding swords that resonate at high frequencies for the last fights in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, and during &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot; and &quot;Revengeance&quot;. 

===Personality===
In his first appearance, Raiden is a rookie agent who is inexperienced as a result of training only in virtual reality. He later reveals, however, that he was a child soldier known as who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden&#x27;s personality; he begins to believe he is only useful on the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend Rosemary would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he has no free will. Solid Snake encourages Raiden to ignore what people tell him and to become self-reliant when problem-solving.

Kojima Productions compared the experiences and ways of thinking of Raiden and Solid Snake. During the game&#x27;s climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden&#x27;s lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changes upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind&#x27;s menaces. Defeating Solidus, Snake encourages Raiden to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff&#x27;s motivation to make a new sequel to &quot;Metal Gear&quot; without Kojima. Kojima also likened Raiden with John Rambo from the &quot;Rambo&quot; series because both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution. Raiden himself believes that he is destined to fight based on his upbringing during &quot;Revengeance&quot; while also following the concept of &quot;katsujinken&quot; in which samurai kill in order to protect the weak.

===Portrayal===

In the Japanese versions of the games, Raiden has been voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi, who first saw him as an attractive young man whose actions in &quot;Son of Liberty&quot; were challenging for his identity. Horiuchi was impressed by the characterization shown across the game, believing him to fit with other members featured in the game. Kojima liked Horiuchi&#x27;s work, believing Raiden became popular in Japan in part because of his performance, something which he felt the character lacked in Western regions. could understand the character&#x27;s pain; despite becoming a cyborg, Raiden still acts like a human. Horiuchi took a liking to Raiden&#x27;s spin-off game, &quot;Revengeance&quot;, as he acted as the lead for the first time but was still glad that he got meet new actors who appeared in the game, most notably the actor behind Doktor. The actors also liked the inclusion of Raiden&#x27;s sidekick, LQ-84i (later renamed Bladewolf), as they believe that ninjas like Raiden obligatory need dogs as allies. Another relationship the actors liked was Raiden&#x27;s exchanges with Courtney due to few female characters being present in the game but felt they made the characters get along properly. Horiuchi felt confident in being in doing Raiden&#x27;s voice as the lead, believing his thirty years of experience made him suitable for the role.

Casting director Kris Zimmerman chose Quinton Flynn, with whom she had previously worked, to voice Raiden in the series&#x27; English adaptation. Flynn remembers having a long time to develop the character and being instructed by Zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced. Flynn said Raiden was one of his favorite video-game voice characters and noted a difference between his roles in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;; Flynn was surprised by fans&#x27; response to the character but said it attracted new fans to the series. Flynn thought fans were angry at the idea that Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games. In promoting &quot;Revengeance&quot;, Raiden&#x27;s design by Shinkawa was used in presence in London, Leeds and Liverpool during 2013. However, he was pleased with working alongside David Hayter whom he often interacted while recording the game. The English voice recording was overlooked by Scott Dolph, who reported back saying the English voice for Raiden was more neutral than the original Japanese voice. 

For &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; Flynn used a deeper voice to match the cyborg Raiden in contrast to the original, youthful Raiden of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. Flynn said the voice he used was &quot;grizzled, yeah—but different enough from the style of Snake&quot;. During development of &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot;, Flynn was not informed about the work despite Raiden being in the trailer. As a result, Flynn kept low hopes in regards to the idea of being cast. Addressing &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;″s Raiden as more aggressive than the original one, Flynn stated his favorite take on the character was &quot;Revengeance&quot;″s as it there he acted as a &quot;blend&quot; between the two incarnations. He felt honored for taking the role of Raiden again, having received a &quot;Behind The Voice Actors&quot; award for his work. In 2015, Flynn stated he was pleased with Raiden&#x27;s role in &quot;Revengeance&quot; and that he would have liked a new sequel Raiden as the lead. Internal problems between Kojima Productions and Konami, however, left Flynn worried there might not be another game in the series.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;===
&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; introduces the player to Raiden in the Plant chapter; Jack is introduced as a newly recruited, virtual reality-trained member of FOXHOUND with no live-combat experience before his current mission. He is assisted via Codec by his commanding officer the Colonel and his girlfriend Rosemary. Raiden&#x27;s initial objective is to rescue several hostages from a terrorist group known as the Sons of Liberty. During his mission, Raiden is helped by mercenary Solid Snake and spy Olga Gurlukovich.

As the story progresses, Jack is revealed to be a former child soldier who fought for the Sons of Liberty leader Solidus Snake during the First Liberian Civil War. After the war&#x27;s end, Raiden was given a normal life and tried to forget his past. It is revealed that a clandestine organization known as The Patriots is controlling his actions and his commanding officer is revealed as their computer-generated artificial intelligence (AI). One of their spies becomes Raiden&#x27;s girlfriend and the two fall in love. Raiden defeats Solidus after the Patriots&#x27; AIs tell him his death would also trigger those of Olga&#x27;s child and Rosemary, the latter of whom is revealed to have been pregnant with Raiden&#x27;s child during the mission. He later reunites with Rosemary, and both decide to stay together to raise their unborn child.

===&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;===
&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; (set five years after &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;) features Raiden after rescuing Olga&#x27;s daughter Sunny from the Patriots, and searching the corpse of the mercenary Big Boss for Big Mama in exchange. The trauma of his breakup with Rosemary and the apparent miscarriage of his child have made Raiden believe he belongs on the battlefield. Raiden is fitted with a cybernetic exoskeleton as a result of the Patriots&#x27; machinations; he helps Solid Snake in the fight against Liquid Ocelot, wanting to obtain the Patriots&#x27; powers. However, he is wounded by Vamp in a fight. With his blood having been replaced with a military substitute called that requires regular maintenance, Raiden is treated by Sunny and Doctor Naomi Hunter. Following his recovery, Raiden goes back to Snake, killing Vamp and stays in Ocelot&#x27;s ship &quot;Outer Haven&quot; to protect Snake as he shuts down the Patriots&#x27; AIs. In an epilogue, Rosemary tells Raiden their child was not miscarried; her marriage to Roy Campbell was a hoax to protect her and their son from the Patriots. Upon hearing this news, Raiden reconciles with Rosemary.

===&quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;===
Raiden returns as the main character in &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, which is set four years after &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;. He is a member of the private military company (PMC) Maverick Security in multiple tasks while raising money for his family. They are attacked by a group of terrorists called Desperado Enforcement LLC that kill his protectee, N&#x27;mani, and leave Raiden near to death with mercenary Jetstream Sam taking a liking to his fighting style. He is given a new cybernetic body by the elder scientist Wilhelm &quot;Doktor&quot; Voight and starts working with Maverick to fight Desperado. Raiden fights Desperado&#x27;s LQ-84i, an AI placed in a robot who works for Desperado but Raiden takes pity on it and has Doktor restore it under the name of Blade Wolf who assists him. Raiden&#x27;s vengeful obsession with Desperado becomes personal when he discovers during a mission to Mexico that Desperado and World Marshal Inc have kidnapped many children, surgically removed their brains to place into cybernetic bodies, and were planning to subject them to VR training modeled on his own. Raiden then resigns from Maverick to pursue and retrieve the children&#x27;s brain cases from World Marshal in Colorado, embracing his sadistic persona &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; due to his constant struggles with Sam and Desperado&#x27;s cyborg Monsoon. Raiden defeats Desperado and learns that Steven Armstrong was using PMCs to distract him as he attempts to create a new War on Terror. When Blade Wolf passes Raiden&#x27;s sword of the late Sam, Raiden stops Armstrong&#x27;s actions and decides not to return to Maverick and travels to the Middle East to battle World Marshal mercenaries.

===Other appearances ===
Raiden does not appear in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; but he is parodied throughout the game by debuting character Raikov. Raiden appears in a series of comical scenes in an early promotional trailer for &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;, in which he fights for control of the franchise with Solid Snake. A sequel to the trailer titled &quot;Metal Gear Raiden: Snake Eraser&quot; was produced; Raiden travels to the past to assassinate Big Boss but fails comically. In the trailer&#x27;s English version, Raiden is voiced by Charlie Schlatter (the voice actor for Raikov) rather than Quinton Flynn. Raiden&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; version appears in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus&quot; expansion pack as an unlockable character. His &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; incarnation appears as a playable character in &quot;Metal Gear Online&quot;.

In &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot;, Raiden stars in a non-canonical mission titled &quot;Jamais Vu&quot;. Having time-traveled to the past, he infiltrates Camp Omega under orders from MSF. His aim is to incapacitate a group of soldiers known as the &quot;body snatchers&quot;, a reference to the android replicators in Kojima&#x27;s video game &quot;Snatcher&quot;. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, Raiden can be unlocked as a costume for the player after completing all missions on the highest possible rank. In both games, his appearance is modeled on that in &quot;Metal Gear Rising&quot;.

The &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; 2007 comic book adaptation by Alex Garner retells Raiden&#x27;s story with few changes. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when Solidus is about to kill him, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game&#x27;s novelization by Raymond Benson makes minor modifications to Raiden&#x27;s history, except for the moment he receives Olga&#x27;s sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial&#x27;s flagpole, causing an American flag to cover his enemy&#x27;s body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.

Outside the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, Raiden appears in the video game &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; as a sticker and a playable sack-boy character in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; downloadable content. He is an unlockable character in &quot;Evolution Skateboarding&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a collectible sticker and spirit respectively, and in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot; as an alternative skin for Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Raiden is playable in the video games &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot; and &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot; using his &quot;Metal Gear Rising&quot; design. The webseries &quot;Mega64&quot; includes a parody of Raiden&#x27;s story in &quot;Revengeance&quot;; the character struggles against his darker persona while making breakfast. Alongside Solid Snake arriving in &quot;Fortnite: Battle Royale&quot;, Raiden has also made an appearance, as an Item Shop purchasable skin, portraying as his &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; design. However, the alteration from his original androgynous persona over a more masculine look in &quot;Fortnite&quot; resulted in a complaint by TheMarySue for the notable overhaul. A robot dressed as Raiden makes a cameo reference in the &quot;Astro Bot&quot; (2024).

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
Raiden&#x27;s replacement of fan favorite Solid Snake in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; proved controversial; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; considered the replacement a reason to dislike the series. The same site criticized Raiden&#x27;s role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; and called him one of the worst aspects of the game. Snake&#x27;s voice actor, David Hayter, was also surprised by the inclusion of Raiden in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, believing his character was meant to be the returning protagonist. The book &quot;Playing with Videogames&quot; states that Raiden&#x27;s inclusion was intended to surprise &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fans who, instead of playing as Snake, played as his opposite. Writer James Newman commented that fans&#x27; reactions were highly negative; they acted as though Kojima had betrayed their expectations. He compared Raiden to the controversial &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Jar Jar Binks. Newman considered trailers for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; in which Raiden is mocked to be Konami&#x27;s comic response to fans&#x27; disapproval. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden&#x27;s role, commenting that his interactions with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake&#x27;s character. Raiden&#x27;s introduction was given an award for &quot;Biggest Surprise&quot; by &quot;GameSpot&quot; in 2001, while Dave Meikleham from &quot;GamesRadar&quot; called Raiden a &quot;surprisingly likeable character&quot; and found his dynamic with Snake appealing. On the other hand, Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan; according to Yoji Shinkawa this was because he matched the stereotype of the manga hero.

Raiden&#x27;s role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; has been analyzed by several writers, who said he is intended to represent the player. His interactions with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as &quot;a &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fan&quot;. As the game progresses it is stated that Raiden &quot;has become Snake&quot;, having developed skills similar to those he gained from taking part in the Big Shell&#x27;s fights that resemble &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s Shadow Moses Island. When an artificial intelligence tells Raiden to &quot;turn off the console&quot;, which confuses both Raiden and the player, this is first interpreted as a fourth wall-breaking joke, but the game&#x27;s climax goes deeper into Raiden&#x27;s connection with the player. Both the player and Raiden take different paths at the game&#x27;s end; the player is told not to waste time playing games while Raiden&#x27;s character is expanded with his decision to move on with his life, rejecting his previous identity by discarding the dog tags the player wore in the beginning. &quot;VG247&quot; wrote the game helps Raiden to better distinguish himself, and for the player to distance themselves, from Snake&#x27;s revered image by deconstructing the latter as an unreliable ally. The recurring plot twist involving Raiden&#x27;s life and the people with whom he often interacts have been praised as being early post-truth content in a video game.

Response to the character in subsequent games was mainly positive. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Pattrick Shaw analyzed his new design for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;; he said Raiden &quot;was in one hell of a fight&quot;. Gavin Mackenzie from &quot;PLAY&quot; criticized and stated that the costume was &quot;cool&quot; but had unnecessary accessories. It has also been compared with Gray Fox&#x27;s cybernetic-ninja design in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. GameSpot staff stated that Raiden &quot;is definitely the inheritor of the quasi-unkillable Cyborg Ninja inheritance&quot; when he made his first appearance in a &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; trailer. &quot;GameSpot&quot; applauded his actions in the trailer, calling it &quot;wordlessly awesome&quot; and comparing his stunts with those in the film &quot;&quot;. Among several cutscenes featuring Raiden, his fight with Vamp was heavily praised by critics due to finding appealing moves. Upon the revelation of Raiden&#x27;s new design as a cyborg ninja, writers said he distanced himself from his previous appearance that imitated Solid Snake. For &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;, Meghan Adams sees the new design as evidence that the slightest hint of androgyny demands the use of coercive violence, even while Raiden&#x27;s androgyny &quot;is, in fact, masculine-leaning.&quot; Voice actor Reuben Langdon described Raiden as a character he always wanted to play as, most notably on &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; In a 2010 &quot;Famitsu&quot; readers&#x27; poll, Raiden was voted the 42nd most-popular video game character.

===Portrayal in &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;===

Dave Meikleham of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; said people who disliked the character would find him appealing in &quot;Rising&quot;. In 2012, manga artist Hiro Mashima drew an illustration of Raiden in anticipation of the series&#x27; following game. He mentioned having had difficulties illustrating the character. Raiden&#x27;s role in &quot;Revengeance&quot; was praised by critics, with GameSpot&#x27;s Peter Brown praising him as an anti-hero, and &quot;GameTrailers&quot; wrote that Raiden&#x27;s new gameplay mechanics contrasted with those found in the earlier games produced by Konami. &quot;The Escapist&quot; said Raiden was now worthy of his own game based on his characterization. &quot;Polygon&quot; said that while Raiden&#x27;s actions provide a departure from the stealth games, his actions were referred as &quot;outlandish and ridiculous&quot;. The detail given to Raiden&#x27;s past was also praised. &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that fans of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; would enjoy the game more because Raiden can replicate his moves from that game&#x27;s cutscenes in gameplay. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said a major change in Raiden&#x27;s characterization is &quot;Revengeance&quot;, referring to him as a &quot;the ultimate cyborg and also the ultimate killer&quot; based on his darker persona that is explored in combat. The idea of Flynn&#x27;s performance earned mixed response due to the tones he gives Raiden when interacting with allies and enemies. Raiden was compared with the lead characters from &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot; favorably due to how they fight. 

In the book &quot;Rules of Nature&quot;, Heather Alexandria, a former writer for Kotaku and Polygon, praised Raiden&#x27;s dark persona as it causes an existential crisis in the protagonist&#x27;s ideals of hero to his psychopath roots. Despite his anti-heroic tendencies, Raiden&#x27;s humanity deeply affects BladeWolf, who stands out as a result of he being an artificial intelligence but manages to make his own rules after interacting with him several times. Another character addressed as a parallel is Sam who comes across as Raiden&#x27;s rival and starts doubting his alliance with the final boss, Armstrong, to help Raiden even after his death by providing him his weapon. Although Armstrong is Raiden&#x27;s final opponent, Rich Stanton of Eurogamer preferred the rematch against Sam, calling it &quot;classic, a desert duel for the ages&quot;. Meanwhile, Rizky Anugrah Putra in the journal &quot;Pulchra Lingua: A Journal of Language Study, Literature &amp; Linguistics&quot; examined how the final boss track &quot;It Has to Be This Way&quot; illustrated the conflict between Raiden and Armstrong and how both men wanting to make the world better, with Armstrong dreaming of America &quot;becoming a country where every citizen can realize and fight for his dreams&quot;. However, despite being able to apprehend each other&#x27;s viewpoints and knowing violence would only make things worse, Armstrong&#x27;s ideals are so extreme that the only resolution is violent conflict, and the resulting destruction will bring change.

Raiden finding conviction with his inner past persona during &quot;Revengeance&quot; was noted to go with the ideas of enjoying the hack and slash mechanics, leading to the handling of violence in video games. In further analysis of Raiden&#x27;s persona from &quot;Metal Gear Rising&quot;, PlayStation LifeStyle praised how the game makes a heavy analysis of Raiden&#x27;s psychology when he starts questioning his missions&#x27; cause and delve into his psychotic instincts when meeting Monsoon. During this scene, Raiden allows himself to go back to his Jack the Ripper persona so that the children he has to save do not meet the same fate as a result of the George Sears Programm which aims to create more soldiers like Raiden. PlayStation Life Style found Raiden&#x27;s mindset to be unique in gaming as both the protagonist and the gamer are addressed about all the previous missions explored before in the title as Raiden had already killed several soldiers to achiveve his means. This contrasts other violent video game protagonists Kratos from &quot;God of War&quot; or Nathan Drake from &quot;Uncharted&quot; whose actions are never questioned in their stories while Raiden instead accepts the sins he has committed.

<text>Kathryn Mary Draper-Garraway (born 4 May 1967) is an English broadcaster and journalist. In the 1990s, Garraway was a journalist for ITV News Central and later a co-presenter of ITV News Meridian. From 2000 to 2010, she co-presented GMTV. Currently, Garraway is the presenter of &quot;Mid Mornings with Kate Garraway&quot; on Smooth Radio and newsreader (on Thursdays) and co-anchor (on Fridays) of the ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;.

==Early life==
Garraway was born in Abingdon, Berkshire. Her father was a civil servant and her mother was a teacher. She attended Dunmore Primary School and Fitzharrys School in Abingdon. She then graduated from Bath College of Higher Education (now Bath Spa University) with a degree in English and history.

==Career==
===Television===
In 1989, Garraway joined the South edition of &quot;ITV News Central&quot; on ITV Central as a production journalist, reporter and news presenter. In 1996, she became co-presenter of the South East edition of &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot; on ITV Meridian after she was &quot;talent spotted&quot; by a boss who viewed her presenting a three-minute bulletin on ITV Central.

In 1998, Garraway joined &quot;Sunrise&quot; on Sky News with Martin Stanford.

Garraway joined GMTV in September 2000, co-presenting &quot;GMTV Today&quot; with Andrew Castle each Friday (and Thursdays later on). Garraway eventually went on to share presenting duties with Fiona Phillips and Emma Crosby. In 2009, when GMTV relaunched, she co-hosted the programme with Ben Shephard, presenting on Mondays, Tuesdays and alternate Wednesdays. During Garraway&#x27;s time at GMTV, she had also co-presented with Eamonn Holmes, John Stapleton and Dan Lobb. She presented her final show on 31 August 2010.

Garraway presented one series of &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; in 2004. In 2007, she was a questioner on &quot;The People&#x27;s Quiz&quot;. In 2009, Garraway presented &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; for ITV. She was later replaced by Davina McCall. Garraway was a regular panellist on &quot;Wall of Fame&quot;, hosted by David Walliams.

Garraway became entertainment editor of &quot;Daybreak&quot; on ITV Breakfast (the successor to GMTV) in September 2010. On 6 December 2011, she took over from Christine Bleakley as the main presenter on an interim basis. On 4 May 2012, it was announced Lorraine Kelly would become the permanent replacement for Bleakley in September 2012. On 3 August 2012, it was reported that Garraway had signed a new contract to present each Friday in Kelly&#x27;s absence. On 15 February 2014, it was announced Kelly would additionally front the Friday edition of &quot;Lorraine&quot;.

On 3 March 2014, it was reported that &quot;Daybreak&quot; would be cancelled and replaced with &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. However, with these changes came the news that Lorraine Kelly would be presenting &quot;Lorraine&quot; five days a week, meaning that Garraway no longer continued to present Kelly&#x27;s show on Fridays. She hosted her final &quot;Daybreak&quot; and &quot;Lorraine&quot; shows on 25 April 2014 ahead of joining &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; the following month. Since joining &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, Garraway&#x27;s appearances on &quot;Lorraine&quot; have become less frequent. Garraway once again became interim main presenter on ITV Breakfast when Ben Shepherd cut his appearances each week to just two; which meant Garraway hosted four times a week until Piers Morgan joined the show later that year.

From March 2014 until November 2016, Garraway occasionally presented &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot; on BBC One. In September 2017, she made a cameo appearance in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.

In November 2019, Garraway came fourth in the nineteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

In 2025, Garraway participated in the sixth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Spag Bol&quot;. Although she was eliminated in the first episode, her identity wasn&#x27;t revealed until the second episode.

====&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;====

Garraway appeared in the fifth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Anton du Beke. Garraway finished 8th of the 14 couples despite receiving the lowest score from the judges in every week but one, as she was repeatedly saved by the public vote, prior to her elimination in week seven.

In February 2008, Garraway launched legal action against the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; after it published a photograph of her embracing du Beke, insinuating that they were having an affair, which the pair both denied.

<text>Manuel Pedro Quintana Sáenz (October 19, 1835 – March 12, 1906) was the President of Argentina from 12 October 1904 to 12 March 1906. He died in office.

== Biography ==
Manuel Quintana was born on October 19, 1835, son of Eladio de la Quintana y Uzín, and María Manuela Bernardina Sáenz de Gaona y Álzaga.

He received a law degree from the University of Buenos Aires in 1855 at the age of twenty and two years later he directed the chair of civil law at the same university.

On December 14, 1861, he married María del Carmen Susana Rodríguez Viana in the Church of San Nicolás de Bari, in Buenos Aires, and they had ten children.

=== Political career ===
He participated in politics since his youth and in 1860 he was elected deputy of the legislature of the Province of Buenos Aires, by the party of Bartolomé Mitre. Subsequently, he went to the Autonomist Party of Adolfo Alsina to oppose Miter&#x27;s project to name the City of Buenos Aires Capital of the Republic.

In 1864, he was elected member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for the province of Buenos Aires and presented a bill to name the City of Rosario as the nation&#x27;s capital, which would be approved but vetoed by the executive power.

In 1870 he was elected National Senator and in 1871 President Sarmiento sent him to Asunción to negotiate the peace treaty that ended the War of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay.

In 1873 he became a Freemason. Also in that year he presented himself as a candidate in the presidential elections to succeed Sarmiento from 1874, but he lost to Nicolás Avellaneda.

In 1877 he held the title of rector of the University of Buenos Aires until 1881 when his term ended.

=== Quintana proposes to England to bomb Rosario ===
In 1876 there was an incident between the government of Santa Fe, at that time in charge of Servando Bayo, and the branch of the Bank of London in Rosario, for not having followed the law that ordered the conversion to gold of all emissions of paper money made by the government of the province.

As a result of this situation, the arrest of the branch manager and the intervention of the branch were ordered. Quintana was a National Senator and the bank&#x27;s legal advisor at the time of the crisis, and he did not hesitate to resign from his bank for &quot;health reasons.&quot; However, Quintana traveled to London, where he proposed to the government of Great Britain the bombing of the city of Rosario if the government of Santa Fe did not cancel the intervention of the bank.

=== Presidential election ===
At the end of the second presidency of Julio A. Roca, the National Autonomist Party was divided into two factions: the one led by Roca and the one led by former president Carlos Pellegrini; For this reason, Roca sought an alliance with Bartolomé Mitre&#x27;s party, proposing an alliance formula that would lead a Mitrist, Manuel Quintana, as a candidate for president, accompanied by the roquista José Figueroa Alcorta. In the presidential elections of April 10, 1904, this formula was triumphant, and they were proclaimed President and Vice President of the Nation on June 12 of the same year by the electoral college. Quintana was 68 years old at the time.

== Presidency ==
His presidency took place within the scope of the period called the &quot;Liberal Republic&quot; or &quot;Conservative Republic&quot;, marked by the elitist government of the National Autonomist Party and electoral fraud.

The Quintana government was a mere continuation of the previous ones: its foreign and economic policies followed the guidelines of Roca&#x27;s; the economy continued to improve, driven by increased trade and the rail network continued to expand.

=== Government works ===
Among his government efforts, it is worth highlighting the nationalization of the University of La Plata, the regulation of the exercise of the liberal professions, the sanction of the Sunday rest law, proposed by the socialist deputy Alfredo Palacios, and the &quot;Lainez Law&quot; for the creation of elementary schools in the provinces.

Quintana did not agree with the uninominal system, established by the electoral law of 1901, since the system of patronage and the pressure on voters had not been modified. So he sent a bill to Congress, proposing a single and universal registry –based on military service records– and the mandatory nature of voting. The original project was so modified that the only thing it had in common with the one presented by the president was the elimination of the single-member system; it was a complete return to the previous system, with all its flaws.

=== Radical revolution of 1905 ===
Since the defeat of 1893, and even more since the division between &quot;bernardistas&quot; and followers of Hipólito Yrigoyen, no one seriously considered the Unión Cívica Radical as a party with the possibility of accessing power. But, suddenly, the UCR reappeared showing a political and territorial organization far superior to that of the ruling party, and a great revolutionary decision, in the radical revolution of 1905, in which several units of the Army were involved. Exploded on February 4 of that year, it was relatively successful in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, Bahía Blanca and Mendoza, but was quickly put down.

=== Attempt on his life ===
On August 11, 1905, Quintana and his wife, Susana Rodríguez Viana, suffered an attack against their lives, when Salvador Planas y Virella, a Catalan anarchist, shot at the presidential vehicle, but he could not carry out his task due to a failure in the pistol he used. Planas declared that he acted alone and that his motivation was to avenge the workers killed during the demonstration on May 21 of that year. He was arrested and during the trial in September 1907 the defense alleged mental instability. Planas was sentenced to 10 years in prison for attempted murder. On January 6, 1911, he fled the Buenos Aires National Penitentiary with the anarchist Francisco Solano Regis, who had attacked President José Figueroa Alcorta, Quintana&#x27;s successor.

== Health and death ==
The stress suffered by the president during the revolution and the subsequent attempt on his life damaged his health. As a consequence, he reduced his working hours to a minimum, which complicated his administration.

Despite all attempts, Quintana&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, so on January 25, 1906, Quintana decided to take a license, delegating the position on an interim basis to Vice President Figueroa Alcorta. Quintana retired to a farm in the current Belgrano neighborhood, to rest and try to improve his health.

However, Quintana was already very old, and finally died on March 12, 1906, becoming the first Argentine president to die in office. His remains rest in the Recoleta Cemetery.

=== Legacy ===
Quintana&#x27;s portrait was featured on the five hundred thousand austral banknote that circulated during the hyperinflation in Argentina from 1989 to 1991.

<doc id="718033" wikidata="Q7305570" url="?curid=718033" title="Redcliffe-Maud Report">
<text>The Redcliffe-Maud Report (Cmnd. 4040) was published in 1969 by the &quot;Royal Commission on Local Government in England&quot;, under the chairmanship of Lord Redcliffe-Maud. Although the commission&#x27;s proposals were broadly accepted by the Labour government, they were set aside by the Conservative government elected in 1970.

==Terms of reference and membership==
The commission was appointed on 7 June 1966, with the following terms of reference:
&quot;...to consider the structure of Local Government in England, outside Greater London, in relation to its existing functions; and to make recommendations for authorities and boundaries, and for functions and their division, having regard to the size and character of areas in which these can be most effectively exercised and the need to sustain a viable system of local democracy; and to report.&quot;

The members of the commission were Redcliffe-Maud (chairman), John Eveleigh Bolton (vice-chairman), Derek Senior, Sir James William Francis Hill, Victor Grayson Hardie Feather, Arthur Hedley Marshall, Peter Mursell, John Laurence Longland, Reginald Charles Wallis, Thomas Dan Smith and Dame Evelyn Adelaide Sharp.

==Report findings==

Broadly the report recommended the abolition of all existing county, county borough, borough, urban district and rural district councils, which had been created at the end of the 19th century, and replacing them with new unitary authorities. These new unitary authorities were largely based on major towns, which acted as regional employment, commercial, social and recreational centres and took into account local transport infrastructure and travel patterns.

There were to be 58 new unitary authorities and three metropolitan areas (Merseyside; South East Lancashire/North East Cheshire or &#x27;Selnec&#x27;; and West Midlands), which were to be sub-divided into lower tier metropolitan districts. These new authorities, along with Greater London, were to be grouped into eight provinces, each with its own provincial council.

===Division of functions===
In arriving at their recommendations, the commissioners were guided by a number of principles which they had themselves devised. These included:
*Town and country are interdependent, therefore the separate administration of urban areas and their rural hinterlands should cease.
*&quot;Physical environment services&quot; should be in the hands of a single authority. Examples of these services included planning and transport. To provide these wide area services, the authority should have boundaries that reflected geographical patterns of population and movement and provided a coherent area of administration.
*&quot;Personal services&quot; should likewise be administered by a single council. These included education, social services, health and housing. The optimum population range over which to provide these services was 250,000 to 1,000,000.
*Wherever possible, both types of services should be in the hands of a single unitary authority.
*Areas for the new authorities should be capable of being effectively and democratically administered by a single council.

Accordingly, the different categories of council would have the following powers and responsibilities:

*Provincial councils: Drawing up of strategic development plans. They were to take over the functions of the existing regional economic planning councils.
*Unitary area councils: Both physical environment and personal services
*Metropolitan area councils: Planning, transport and general housing policy.
*Metropolitan district councils: Education and personal social services.

===Local councils===
It had originally been envisaged that parish councils should also be abolished, but the Secretary of the National Association of Parish Councils (NACP), Charles Arnold-Baker, convinced the commission that they should be preserved.

===Derek Senior&#x27;s memorandum of dissent===
The commission was nearly unanimous, with some reservations as to the exact geographic details. One member of the commission, Derek Senior, dissented entirely from the proposals, and put forward his own in a memorandum of dissent (Cmnd. 4040-I), which was slightly larger than the report itself. He would have preferred a two-tier system, with 35 city-regions of varying size, along with 148 districts. These were to be further grouped into five provinces. At a lower level, there would be &#x27;common councils&#x27;, roughly equivalent to civil parish councils, which would also cover communities within large towns; special arrangements were to be made for the area surrounding Berwick-upon-Tweed. These proposals effectively ignored traditional boundaries, to a much greater extent than the Report itself did.

==Reaction==
Immediately after the report was published, the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, said that he accepted the recommendations &quot;in principle&quot; and committed the government to &quot;press ahead quickly&quot; on the legislation necessary to implement it, later clarifying that legislation would probably follow in the 1970–71 or 1971–72 parliamentary session. The Labour Party Government issued a white paper entitled &quot;Reform of Local Government in England&quot; (Cmnd 4276) in February 1970, broadly accepting the recommendations of the report. The Government had however added two new metropolitan areas: West Yorkshire (with the five Bradford/Leeds/Halifax/Huddersfield/Mid-Yorkshire unitaries as districts), and South Hampshire based on the Southampton and Portsmouth unitaries, with the Isle of Wight being a separate district.

Observers felt that the Conservative Party, then in opposition, had no urgency in defining their position. The shadow spokesman Peter Walker did not commit himself but instead held a series of regional conferences to ascertain party grassroots opinion. Reports suggested these conferences were overwhelmingly hostile and the Conservative Party conference in 1969 passed a highly critical motion, while suggesting that some reform of local government was supported. Walker decided that a future Conservative government could not implement Redcliffe-Maud, but refused to disown the report completely.

The Rural District Councils Association was immediately opposed to the proposals which would see their members subsumed in much larger authorities. They started a national campaign with the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Vote for R.E. Mote&quot; (with Mr R.E. Mote depicted as an insensitive bureaucrat), distributing material to all their members. The slogan was used on postal franking from the affected authorities. Swale Rural District Council was forced to opt out of the campaign due to the similarity of &quot;R.E. Mote&quot; with the local Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate R.D. Moate. By coincidence, Moate had moved the motion opposing Redcliffe-Maud at the Conservative Party conference.

==New government==
When the Conservatives won the 1970 general election, they did so on a manifesto committed to a two-tier system in local government. In 1971 a further white paper entitled &quot;Local Government in England: Government Proposals for Reorganisation&quot; (Cmnd 4584) announced its intentions, which ultimately led to the 1974 re-organisation. Although the general plan of the report was abandoned, many of the specific innovations were carried over, such as the plan to associate Slough with Berkshire, and Bournemouth with Dorset.

==Aftermath==
In the actual 1974 re-organisation, the three metropolitan areas became metropolitan counties, though their area was greatly reduced. A further three were added, covering the Leeds/Bradford area (West Yorkshire), the Sheffield/Rotherham area (South Yorkshire) and the Tyneside area (Tyne and Wear). The concept of authorities based around Bristol (Avon), and Teesside (Cleveland) was also retained. In most areas though, the 1974 system was far more conservative and retained more traditional boundaries.

The situation of wholly two-tier government did not last. The county councils for the metropolitan counties were abolished in 1986 by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government, making the metropolitan boroughs effectively into unitary authorities. A further set of reforms in the 1990s led to the re-establishment of many old county boroughs as unitary authorities, along with other areas.

In 2004 the Government put forward a proposal to introduce directly-elected regional assemblies in the three regions of Northern England, should referendums produce a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote (in the event the first region voted &#x27;no&#x27; overwhelmingly, and the other referendums were abandoned). The regional boundaries proposed were very similar to the three northern Redcliffe-Maud provinces. Associated with this reform would have been a move to wholly unitary local government in the affected regions. In the area of Cumbria and Lancashire, the proposals bore a striking resemblance to the ones in the Report.

==Proposed unitary and metropolitan areas==

Greater London was outside the scope of the report, having been reorganised in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963.

<text>The Capital District () is a federal district of Venezuela. It has an area of and there is only one administrative division (&quot;municipio&quot;), Libertador, which contains about half of Caracas, the Venezuelan capital city, which is also the seat of the three branches of the federal government of Venezuela. The population in 2004 was 2,073,768. The District borders on the states of Vargas and Miranda.

==Government==

Formerly it had its own local government with a governor, but the constitutional reform of 1999 abolished the district government and created instead the Metropolitan District of Caracas, with jurisdiction over the territory of the District and also four adjacent &quot;municipios&quot; (Baruta, Chacao, el Hatillo and Sucre) in Miranda which all together form the city.

On 13 April 2009, the National Assembly passed a law creating the figure of a head of government for the district which would be designated by the President. On 14 April 2009, Jacqueline Faría became the first Head of Government of the Capital District. During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, General Antonio José Benavides Torres of the National Guard was appointed to be the Head of Government of the Capital District by disputed President Maduro.

<text>Jacques Martin (; 25 September 1921 – 21 January 2010) was a French comics artist and comic book creator. He was one of the classic artists of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, alongside Edgar P. Jacobs and Hergé, of whom he was a longtime collaborator. He is best known for his series &quot;Alix&quot;. He was born in Strasbourg.

==Biography==
After pursuing engineering studies as a young man, Jacques Martin began in 1942 to draw his first comic stories. In 1946, following the end of the War, he travelled through Belgium in search of an editor for his work. Soon afterwards he met Georges Remi (aka Hergé) with whom he collaborated on several albums of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (and more specifically on &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; and &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;) while working on his own albums. It was from Hergé that he learned of the ligne claire style and, under Hergé&#x27;s guidance, began to use it in his own work. He would later be considered one of the great five of the ligne claire style, along with Hergé, Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor and Willy Vandersteen.

In 1948, he created &quot;Alix&quot;, his most famous series, published in the magazine Tintin, whose adventures - extremely well researched - occur in Roman antiquity. This historic comic soon became one of the most popular of the genre and went on to be published in several countries worldwide.

The story &quot;Le spectre de Carthage&quot; won the award for best French realistic comic book at the 1978 Angoulême International Comics Festival.

Martin went on to create other characters, beginning with the contemporary journalist &quot;Lefranc&quot; in 1952. Much later he created others in collaboration with various partners, namely the medieval architect &quot;Jhen&quot; (initially entitled &quot;Xan&quot;) in 1978, the French revolutionary officer &quot;Arno&quot; in 1984, the Athenian &quot;Orion&quot; in 1990, and the Egyptian &quot;Keos&quot; in 1992. In 2003, he also started a new series - &quot;Loïs&quot; set in the court of Louis the sun king of France.

In 1998, due to failing eyesight, Martin left the drawing of &quot;Alix&quot; to Rafael Morales. &quot;Alix&quot; continues running with great success. Martin died on 21 January 2010.

<text>Charles Albert Vanik (April 7, 1913 – August 30, 2007) was a Democratic politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1955 to 1981.

==Early life==
Vanik was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Stella (née Kvasnicka) and Charles Albert Vanik, a butcher. He was of Czech ancestry. His maternal grandmother, Alžběta Seberová (1868–1948), was born in village Hracholusky, southern Bohemia (then part of the Austria-Hungary). Vanik completed undergraduate studies and a law degree at Western Reserve University. After serving on the Cleveland City Council from 1938 to 1939 and the Ohio State Senate from 1940 to 1942, Vanik enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, seeing action in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After the war, Vanik served as a city judge from 1946 to 1954.

==United States House of Representatives==
In 1954, he ran for Ohio&#x27;s 21st congressional district. The district, located on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side, was evenly divided between African Americans, who were then solidly Republican voters, and whites, who were mostly Democrats. In the Democratic primary, Vanik defeated longtime incumbent Congressman Robert Crosser as well as African-American challenger John Holly, founder of the Negro Future Outlook League.

In the general election, Vanik defeated African-American Republican Francis E. Young, who helped organize the Cleveland branch of the NAACP. Vanik shifted districts in 1968 to the neighboring , to make way for Louis Stokes whose growing political operation had challenged him in previous races, defeating Frances P. Bolton, who had served the district since 1939. Vanik served in the district until 1981.

In 1974, Vanik sponsored the Jackson–Vanik amendment with Sen. Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, which denied normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted the freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to allow refugees, particularly religious minorities, to escape from the Soviet Bloc. During this time, Vanik was the chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.

He used to insert into the &quot;Congressional Record &quot;what he called the &quot;Annual Corporate Tax Study&quot; in which he&#x27;d list corporations that paid little to no federal income taxes.

In 1982, Vanik contested for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant-governor of Ohio as running mate with Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown who was running for governor. The ticket lost to Richard F. Celeste and Myrl Shoemaker. Vanik was known for wearing black bow ties with every suit.

==Death==

Vanik died in his sleep on August 30, 2007, at his home in Jupiter, Florida. He was 94. He was survived by his wife, Betty, one son, one daughter and two grandchildren.

<text>Edgard Félix Pierre Jacobs (30 March 1904 – 20 February 1987), better known under his pen name Edgar P. Jacobs, was a Belgian comic book creator (writer and artist), born in Brussels, Belgium. He was one of the founding fathers of the Franco-Belgian comics movement, through his collaborations with Hergé and the graphic novel series that made him famous, &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot;.

==Biography==
Edgar Félix Pierre Jacobs was born in Brussels in 1904. Jacobs remembered having drawn for as far back as his memory would go. His real love though was for the dramatic arts and the opera in particular. In 1919 he graduated from the commercial school where his parents had sent him, and privately swore he would never work in an office. He kept on drawing in his spare time, focusing his greatest attention on musical and dramatic training. He took on odd jobs at the opera, including decoration, scenography, and painting, and sometimes got to work as an extra. In 1929 he received the annual Belgian government medal for excellence in classical singing. Financial good fortune did not follow, since the Great Depression hit the Brussels artistic community very hard.

After a career as extra and baritone singer in opera productions between 1919 and 1940 in Brussels and Lille, punctuated by small drawing commissions, Jacobs turned permanently to illustration, drawing commercial illustrations and collaborating in the children&#x27;s weekly comic magazine &quot;Bravo&quot; until 1946, after he was introduced there by Jacques Laudy. This review or periodical was a smashing success, hitting a circulation of 300,000 at times.

When the American comic strip &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; was prohibited in Belgium by the German occupation authorities during World War II, he was asked to write an end to the comic in order to provide a denouement to the readers. German censorship banned this continuation after only a couple of weeks. Jacobs subsequently published his first comic strip in &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Le Rayon U&quot; (&quot;The U Ray&quot;), largely in the same &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; style.

Around this time, he became a stage painter for a theatre adaptation for Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;. Although the play was only a modest success, it brought him into contact with Hergé and the two quickly become friends. As a direct result, he assisted Hergé in coloring the black and white strips of &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; from Le Soir in preparation for book publication in 1942, and from 1944 on he helped him in the recasting of his earlier albums &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; for color book publication. After the project, he continued to contribute directly in the drawing as well as the storyline for the new Tintin double-albums &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;/&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. Jacobs, as a fan of opera, decided to take Hergé with him to a concert. Hergé did not like opera, however, and for decades he would gently lampoon his friend Jacobs through the device of opera singer Bianca Castafiore, a supporting character in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Hergé also gave him tiny cameo roles in &quot;Tintin&quot; adventures, sometimes under the name Jacobini, for example in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; where Jacobini is the name of an opera singer advertised as starring alongside La Castafiore in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and as a mummified egyptologist on the cover of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, as well as in the rewritten version. In a 1977 interview with the BBC (excerpted in 2016 on the &quot;Witness&quot; radio program/podcast), Hergé stated that Jacobs was part of his inspiration for the major character of Captain Haddock: &quot;He [Jacobs] is just like Captain Haddock, full of movement...bursting into...invective.&quot;

In 1946, Jacobs was part of the team gathered by Raymond Leblanc around the new Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, where his story &quot;Le secret de l’Espadon&quot; (&quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;) was published on 26 September, the first of the &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; series.

In 1947, Jacobs asked to share the credit with Hergé on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. When Hergé refused, their collaboration suffered a bit of a setback. Hergé still remained a friend however, and as before &quot;Blake et Mortimer&quot; continued to be serialised in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. In 1950, Jacobs published &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot;. Many others soon followed. Jacobs finally published in 1970 the first volume of &quot;The Three formulas of Professor Sato&quot;, which was staged in Japan.

In 1973 he restyled his first full-length album, &quot;Le Rayon U&quot;, and wrote his autobiography under the title &quot;Un opéra de papier: Les mémoires de Blake et Mortimer&quot;. He then wrote the scenario for the second episode of &quot;Les Trois Formules du Professeur Sato&quot;, but the artwork remained unfinished at the time of his death. Bob de Moor was drafted in to complete the album, which was published in 1990.

Jacobs has two stone sphinxes to commemorate him. One of them is in the &quot;Bois des Pauvres&quot; near Brussels, where his home used to stand, and the other one is over his tomb at the Lasne cemetery, also near Brussels. The cemetery sphinx has a &quot;collar&quot; beard, and his face looks a lot like Philip Mortimer, the protagonist of most of the Jacobs albums.

Jacobs&#x27; style varies greatly from one album to another. There are however many common threads, such as the theme of subterranean descent and the consistent Ligne claire drawing style.

<doc id="718046" wikidata="Q613882" url="?curid=718046" title="Universi Dominici gregis">
<text>Universi Dominici gregis is an apostolic constitution of the Catholic Church issued by Pope John Paul II on 22 February 1996. It superseded Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1975 apostolic constitution, &quot;Romano Pontifici eligendo&quot;, and all previous apostolic constitutions and orders on the subject of the election of the pope.

&quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; (&quot;the Lord&#x27;s whole flock&quot;, from the opening statement &quot;The Shepherd of the Lord&#x27;s whole flock is the Bishop of the Church of Rome&quot;), subtitled &quot;On the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff&quot;, deals with the vacancy of the See of Rome, i.e., the papacy.

The constitution modified or in some cases confirmed the rules, for the conclave. It also clarified, during a &quot;sede vacante&quot;, which matters could be handled by the College of Cardinals and which matters were reserved for the future pope.

The constitution was later amended by Pope Benedict XVI with the &quot;motu proprio&quot;s &quot;De aliquibus mutationibus in normis de electione romani Romani pontificis&quot; in 2007 and by &quot;Normas nonnullas&quot; in 2013.

==Contents==
&quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; consists of an introduction followed by a body of 92 numbered sections, normally just one paragraph but occasionally more than one, and a concluding &quot;Promulgation&quot;, which activates the document. The body is divided into two parts, but the 92 sections are numbered continuously.

;Part One
During a &quot;sede vacante&quot;, the College has no power in things which pertain to the pope during his lifetime or of his office. Any such act that the College exercises beyond the limits expressly permitted by this document is null and void.

* To be eligible to vote, a cardinal must be no more than eighty years of age on the day before the death or resignation of the pope.
* The maximum number of cardinal electors who can participate in a conclave is 120.
* A vote may or may not be taken on the afternoon of the first day. If such a vote occurs, only one vote shall take place and it is counted separately for purposes of determining when a change in the balloting requirements can be made, as explained elsewhere in this constitution.
* Excluding the afternoon of the first day, a maximum of four votes are taken each day, two votes in the morning and two in the afternoon.
* On the first 32 ballots taken (or 33, if a ballot was cast on the afternoon of the first day), a pope shall be elected by a vote of two-thirds of those participating in the conclave. Thereafter, an absolute majority of the conclave participants may change the rule that a two-thirds vote is required for election to a different threshold, but a valid election always requires an absolute majority of the votes. (This was later modified by Benedict XVI.)

;Part Two
Chapter II deals with arrangements involving the public viewing and burial of the deceased pope and matters after his death and it provides for the organization of the College into a General Congregation and a Particular Congregation.
*The General Congregation consists of the entire College of Cardinals. Attendance at meetings is mandatory for all cardinals who have arrived at the Vatican to participate in the selection of the new pope except for those over age 80, whose attendance is optional. This Congregation handles matters of major importance that cannot be handled by the Particular Congregation.
*The Particular Congregation consists of the Cardinal Camerlengo and three Cardinals, one from each order chosen by lot from the General Congregation. Except for the Camerlengo, the term of each of these three cardinals is three days. This Congregation handles routine matters. Any decision of a Particular Congregation cannot be changed by a later Particular Congregation, but only by a majority vote of the General Congregation.

==Major changes==
===Secrecy===
Strict secrecy is to be ensured throughout the process. Anyone violating the security of the Vatican, introducing recording equipment, or communicating with a cardinal elector in any way, risks excommunication. Other penalties are at the discretion of the incoming Pope. Participants are required to take oaths of secrecy.

===Methods of election===
Previously, in addition to secret ballot two other methods were allowed for the conduct of the election. A committee of nine to fifteen unanimously chosen cardinals might have been delegated, to make the choice for all (&quot;election by compromise&quot;, &quot;per compromissum&quot;). Alternatively, formal ballots could be discarded: in &quot;election by acclamation&quot; (&quot;per acclamationem seu inspirationem&quot;) the electors simultaneously shouted out the name of their preferred candidate. Both of these methods have now been abolished: the rationale given was that either compromise or acclamation would not require each cardinal to express his preference. Also, these two methods tended to produce controversy, and in any case neither had been used for quite some time—the last compromise election was of Pope John XXII in 1316, and the last affirmation (acclamation) election was of Innocent XI in 1676. As a result, election by secret ballot is now the only valid method of electing a Pope.

===Living quarters===
&quot;Universi Dominici gregis&quot; provided that Cardinals would be housed in Domus Sanctae Marthae, a building with dormitory type accommodation built within the Vatican City. Previously Cardinals were housed in improvised accommodations which were often noted for not being particularly comfortable.

===Other===

* New voting procedures allowed for the election of a pope by a simple majority in certain circumstances.
* For the first time in centuries cardinals were to be housed in apartments separate from the Sistine Chapel.
* The method by which a pope symbolically took office was made less specific. Whereas Pope Paul&#x27;s &quot;Romano Pontifici Eligendo&quot; spoke of a coronation, the new apostolic constitution referred to the &quot;inauguration of the pontificate&quot; without choosing between an enthronement ceremony, a papal coronation or the papal inauguration used since 1978.
*The document anticipated the possibility of a papal resignation when specifying that the procedures it prescribes should be observed &quot;even if the vacancy of the Apostolic See should occur as a result of the resignation of the Supreme Pontiff&quot;.(para. 77)

==Later use and amendment==

The only papal election held under these rules without amendment was that of 2005 that chose John Paul&#x27;s successor Benedict XVI.

On 11 June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI reinstated the requirement that a papal election require a two-thirds majority regardless of the number of ballots taken.

After Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation, on 25 February 2013, he issued another decree, &quot;Normas nonnullas&quot;, which allowed the College of Cardinals to bring forward the start of a conclave once all cardinals are present or delay the start a few days if serious reasons justify the change in scheduling. He also amended the rules to declare automatic excommunication of any non-cardinal who broke the oath of secrecy of the College of Cardinals during the proceedings. Previously any such person was subject to punishment at the discretion of the new pope. The new rules were first applied in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis.

<text>Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (July 17, 1843 – October 19, 1914) was an army general and statesman who served as President of Argentina from 1880 to 1886 and from 1898 to 1904. Roca is the most important representative of the Generation of &#x27;80 and is known for directing the Conquest of the Desert, a series of military campaigns against the indigenous peoples of Patagonia sometimes considered a genocide. 

During his two terms as president, many important changes occurred, particularly major infrastructure projects of railroads and port facilities; increased foreign investment, along with immigration from Europe and particular large-scale immigration from southern Europe; expansion of the agricultural and pastoral sectors of the economy; and laicizing legislation strengthening state power. 

Roca&#x27;s main foreign policy concern was to set border limits with Chile, which had never been determined with precision. In 1881 Argentina gained territory by treaty with Chile.

==Upbringing and early career==

Roca was born in the northwestern city of San Miguel de Tucumán in 1843 into a prominent local family. He graduated from the National College in Concepción del Uruguay, Entre Ríos. Before he was 15, Roca joined the army of the Argentine Confederation, on 19 March 1858. While still an adolescent, he went to fight as a junior artillery officer in the struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, first on the side of the provinces and later on behalf of the capital. He also fought in the War of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay between 1865 and 1870. Roca rose to the rank of colonel serving in the war to suppress the revolt of Ricardo López Jordán in Entre Ríos. President Nicolás Avellaneda later promoted him to General after his victory over rebel general José M. Arredondo in the battle of Santa Rosa, leading the loyalist forces. Roca saw the army &quot;as an agent of national unification,&quot; and his experience in the army &quot;broadened his understanding of Argentina and the provincial upper class.&quot;

==Political beginnings==

In 1878, during Nicolás Avellaneda&#x27;s presidency, he became Minister of War and it was his task to prepare a campaign that would bring an end to the &quot;frontier problem&quot; after the failure of the plan of Adolfo Alsina (his predecessor). A number of indigenous groups defended their traditional territories and frequently assaulted non-indigenous frontier settlements, taking horses and cattle, and capturing women and children, who were enslaved or offered as brides to the warriors. Roca&#x27;s approach to dealing with the Indian communities of the Pampas, however, was completely different from Alsina&#x27;s, who had ordered the construction of a ditch and a defensive line of small fortresses across the Province of Buenos Aires. Roca saw no way to end native attacks (&quot;malones&quot;) but by putting under effective government control all land up to the Río Negro in a campaign (known as the Conquest of the Desert) that would &quot;extinguish, subdue or expel&quot; the Indians who lived there. &quot;He began the campaign against the Ranqueles&quot;, which eventually resulted in the &quot;transfer of 35% of national territory from the Indians to local caudillos. This land conquest would also strengthen Argentina&#x27;s strategic position against Chile.

He devised a &quot;tentacle&quot; move, with waves of 6,000 men cavalry units stemming coordinately from Mendoza, Córdoba, Santa Fé and Buenos Aires in July 1878 and April 1879 respectively, with an official toll of nearly 1,313 Native Americans killed and 15,000 taken as prisoners, and is credited with the liberation of several hundred European hostages.

==First presidency==

In mid-1879, after the death of Alsina, Roca became the most prestigious leader of the National Autonomous Party, and was proposed as a candidate by Cordoba&#x27;s governor Miguel Celman, and in Buenos Aires by the doctor Eduardo Wilde; quickly gained the support of most of the Argentine state governors. The April 11 elections for president, which came a sweeping victory for the voters of Roca, except in Buenos Aires and Corrientes. On June 13 the Electoral College met and elected President General Roca and Vice President Francisco Bernabé Madero. But in Buenos Aires it was brewing a revolution against the triumph of Roca. Four days later the fighting began, which ended on June 25 with an agreement between the province and the nation; the revolution of 1880 had cost 3,000 dead. Shortly before the presidential inauguration Roca was passed in Congress federalization of Buenos Aires.

Under his mandate the so-called &quot;laicist laws&quot; (&quot;Leyes Laicas&quot;) were passed, which nationalized a series of functions that previously were under the control of the Church. He also created the so-called &quot;Registro Civil&quot;, an index of all births, deaths and marriages. President Roca also made primary education free of charge by nationalizing education institutions run by the Church. This led to a break in relations with the Vatican. Roca presided over an era of rapid economic development fueled by large scale European immigration, railway construction, and booming agricultural exports. In May 1886 Roca was the subject of a failed assassination attempt.

==Continuing political involvement==

Roca himself had put forward Juárez Celman as his successor, who was his brother-in-law. However, Celman distanced himself from Roca. Celman&#x27;s government was ultimately tarnished by the Baring crisis and corruption allegations.

Roca did not participate in the 1890 revolution attempt against Celman, which was instigated by Leandro N. Alem and Bartolomé Mitre (&quot;Unión Cívica&quot;, later &quot;Unión Cívica Radical&quot;). However, he was pleased in the resulting weakness of Miguel Juárez Celman. 

After his first presidency Roca remained important politically, becoming a senator and Minister of the Interior under Carlos Pellegrini. After President Luis Sáenz Peña resigned in January 1895, José Evaristo Uriburu took over the presidency, when Roca was President of the Senate. Because of this, Roca again assumed the duties of President between 28 October 1895 and 8 February 1896, when Uriburu was ill.

==Second presidency==

In the middle of 1897 the &quot;Partido Autonomista Nacional&quot; party put forward Roca as a presidential candidate once more. Unopposed, he was able to begin a second regular term in office on 12 October 1898. During his second presidency, the &quot;Residence Law&quot; () was passed, which made it possible to expel some of Argentina&#x27;s trade union leaders, who were noncitizen anarchists and socialists deemed dangerous to Argentina.

During this presidency military service was introduced in 1901 and a border dispute with Chile was settled in 1902 by singing the Pacts of May and erecting Christ the Redeemer of the Andes with significant assistance from Ángela de Oliveira Cézar de Costa the sister of his mistress Guillermina Oliveira Cézar. Luis Drago, Roca&#x27;s foreign minister, articulated the Drago Doctrine of 1902 asserting that foreign powers could not collect public debts from sovereign American states by armed force or occupation of territory. Argentina&#x27;s foreign debt increased in this period, although economic growth continued. Roca was unable to continue his political domination, and he was unable to essentially name his successor. Roca&#x27;s second term ended in 1904, and is considered less successful than his first.

==Later years==

In 1912 Roca was appointed as Special Ambassador of Argentina to Brazil by President Roque Sáenz Peña. Roca returned to Argentina in 1914 and died in Buenos Aires on October 19, 1914. He was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

His son, Julio Argentino Roca, Jr., became vice-president of Argentina in 1932 to 1938.

==Legacy==

Roca&#x27;s thought has been associated with the idea of Juan Bautista Alberdi around the idea of a &quot;possible republic&quot;: a republican government, with broad civil and economic freedoms but with an exercise of political life restricted to the ruling elites. The possible republic would give way to the true republic, of a fully democratic character. The ideal of a possible republic, with its politically conservative line, was one of the sources of political conflict that led to the emergence of various oppositions, even from the members of the Generation of &#x27;80 themselves.

During the twentieth century, Roca was recognized as one of the statesmen who forged the foundations of the modern Argentine republic. As such, Roca has been honored by designating cities, departments, lakes, streets, avenues, squares, monuments, parks, schools and railway lines throughout the country. Examples include the city of General Roca in the province of Río Negro, the town of Presidencia Roca in the province of Chaco; the town of Presidente Roca in the province of Santa Fe; the Colonia Roca of the province of Entre Ríos; the General Roca Department of the province of Córdoba. In Buenos Aires, a major thoroughfare and a railway branch are named after him and an equestrian statue of him was erected in 1941. 
In recent years, there has been an increasing re-evaluation of Roca&#x27;s place in Argentine history, particularly his involvement in the Conquest of the Desert. Some groups claim that he committed genocide against the Native Argentines. Those who consider Roca as genocidal have proposed removing the name Roca from the places and areas with which he has been honored.

In 1882, he occupied a seat on the Supreme Court of the Province of Buenos Aires. Later he was employed as president of the Provincial Bank, director of the Academy of Jurisprudence, and had a seat in the General Council of Education.

On 18 November 1848, he married Cipriana du Cos de La Hitte (born 6 December 1829, Montevideo, Uruguay - died 23 October 1916) in the Church of Saint Ignatius, in Buenos Aires.

===Political office===
In 1882, he served as a member of the Supreme Court of the Province of Buenos Aires. Later, he served as president of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. He was also several times a national deputy and senator.

==Presidency==
Luis Sáenz-Peña, a prominent Catholic leader, was anointed as a transitional president, after an agreement between Julio Argentino Roca&#x27;s and Bartolome Mitre&#x27;s factions that prevented the electoral participation of the brand new U.C.R.

On 12 October 1892, Sáenz-Peña was inaugurated president of the country. He began his mandate convinced that his mission was to finish getting out of the Panic of 1890. He decided not to contract new debts, and personally renegotiated the existing ones in London: the financial situation forced the bankers to accept the conditions imposed by the Minister of Finance, Juan José Romero, who got some cuts in the capital and a somewhat longer term. By mid-1893, the crisis could be considered over.

During his tenure, the Ministry of Public Works managed to expand the railway network, to the point that all provincial capitals — except La Rioja — were linked by rails. The cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario and Santa Fe finished their ports, and the capital opened the Avenida de Mayo, which for more than half a century would be the show window of the great city.

In 1893, Congress approved the creation of the National Charity Lottery, today the National Lottery, which became active in 1894.

In 1894, Law 1,894 was enacted, which yielded large portions of the Chaco National Territory to neighboring provinces, especially benefiting the Province of Santa Fe.

==Revolution and resignation==

In 1895, the political situation became more unstable every day, due to the evident incapacity of the president; Sáenz-Peña changed his entire cabinet of ministers several times, unsuccessfully seeking to avoid journalistic criticism.

The situation spread to the interior provinces, where on several occasions the governments were overthrown, thus increasing instability. Sáenz-Peña, increasingly disoriented, tried all possible alliances, and finally - before the imminence of a radical revolution - appointed Aristóbulo del Valle Minister of War and Navy. This convinced him to disarm the National Guards, with the apparent aim of avoiding new revolutions, but a few days later the radical revolution broke out.

Sáenz-Peña no longer controlled his ministers, who ruled according to Roca and Pellegrini&#x27;s instructions. In mid-January 1895, all of them submitted their resignations en masse. Sáenz-Peña submitted his resignation on 22 January, which was received with relief by the public opinion. The government passed into the hands of José Evaristo Uriburu, who completed the term ending in 1898.

==Death==
He died in Buenos Aires on December 4, 1907, at the age of 85. He is buried in the Recoleta Cemetery.

<text>Carlos Enrique José Pellegrini Bevans (October 11, 1846 – July 17, 1906) was Vice President of Argentina and became President of Argentina from August 6, 1890 to October 12, 1892, upon Miguel Ángel Juárez Celman&#x27;s resignation (see Revolución del Parque).

==President of Argentina==

During his administration, he cleaned up the finances and created the &quot;Banco de la Nación Argentina&quot;, Argentina&#x27;s national bank, and the prestigious high-school that carries his name, &quot;Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini&quot;, public school of noted academic level, part of Universidad de Buenos Aires. 

After the end of his term, he served as senator between 1895 and 1903, and in 1906, he was elected National Representative in the lower house.

==His life==

Pellegrini was the son of Swiss-Italian engineer Charles Henri Pellegrini (born in Chambéry) and María Bevans Bright, and grandson of English engineer James &quot;Santiago&quot; Bevans.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a Freemason. He died in his native city of Buenos Aires and is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery.

<text>A marotte is a prop stick or sceptre with a carved head on it. Jesters usually used a marotte. The word is borrowed from the French, where it signifies either a fool&#x27;s (literal) &quot;bauble&quot; or a fad.

Typically carried by a jester or Arlecchino, the miniature head often reflects the costume of the jester who carries it. Modern marottes typically have music boxes or other machinery built into the head. Older marottes may utilize swivel heads with bells.

==In popular culture==
In Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the singer of the title role, a jester, carries a marotte, which often has on it the faces of comedy and tragedy.

In the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Rentaghost&quot;, the ghostly jester Timothy Claypole has a marotte referred to as &quot;Tiny Timothy&quot;.

<doc id="718060" wikidata="Q983528" url="?curid=718060" title="Louis Stokes">
<text>Louis Stokes (February 23, 1925 – August 18, 2015) was an American attorney, civil rights pioneer and politician. He served 15 terms in the United States House of Representatives – representing the east side of Cleveland – and was the first African American congressman elected in the state of Ohio. He was one of the Cold War-era chairmen of the House Intelligence Committee, headed the Congressional Black Caucus, and was the first African American on the House Appropriations Committee.

==Early life==
Stokes was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Louise (née Stone) and Charles Stokes. He and his brother, politician Carl B. Stokes, lived in one of the first federally funded housing projects, the Outhwaite Homes. Stokes attended Central High School and later served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946. After attending Western Reserve University and the Cleveland State University College of Law on the G.I. Bill, Stokes began practicing law in Cleveland in 1953. He argued the &quot;stop and frisk&quot; case of &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; before the United States Supreme Court in 1968. Later in 1968, he was elected to the House, representing the 21st District of Ohio on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side. He shifted to the newly created 11th District, covering much of the same area following a 1992 redistricting. Stokes served 30 years in total, retiring in 1999.

==Career==
Stokes&#x27; tenure in the House of Representatives included service on the House Appropriations Committee, where he was influential in bringing revenue to Cleveland. He was particularly interested in veterans&#x27; issues and secured funds for health-care facilities for veterans in Cleveland.

In the 1970s, Stokes served as chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, charged with investigating the murders of President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He served on the House committee that investigated the Iran-Contra Affair. As chairman of the House Ethics Committee, Stokes oversaw the committee&#x27;s investigation of a corruption scandal known as ABSCAM in 1979–80, which eventually led to convictions of one senator and six House members. Recalling Stokes, U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said: &quot;We were in the midst of a huge ... corruption scandal, and public service was taking a public beating. But Lou Stokes was there as a shining beacon of integrity, of excellence and most important of all for us, of justice.&quot;

In 1971, he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
In 1992, Stokes ran for president as an Ohio favorite son, winning the delegates from his home district in Ohio, and then, in a minor Democratic convention drama, refused to release the delegate&#x27;s votes until the Clinton campaign formally asked for them.

Following his time in Congress, Stokes became a distinguished visiting professor at the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. He actively served in this role until the time of his death.

==Personal life==
Stokes&#x27; daughter, Angela, is a former Cleveland Municipal Court judge who served from 1995 through 2015, while another, Lori, was Co-anchor of The 5 O&#x27;clock News and The 10 O&#x27;clock news and Anchor of The 6 O&#x27;clock News until 2022 and earlier Co-anchor of Good Day New York WNYW Fox 5. His son, Chuck, is also a journalist with WXYZ-TV in Detroit. His daughter, Shelley, is a historic preservationist, writer and public relations professional. Stokes&#x27; brother, Carl B. Stokes, was the first African American mayor of a large American city. Stokes was a cousin of funk and R&amp;B musician Rick James.

Stokes was a Prince Hall Freemason, and a member of the Cleveland Alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

===Later life and death===
Stokes retired in 2012 as senior counsel in the law firm of Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, with offices in Cleveland and Washington.

On July 20, 2015, it was reported that Stokes had both brain cancer and lung cancer. He died on August 18, 2015, at his home in Cleveland from the diseases at the age of 90. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

==Legacy==
The Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority opened the Louis Stokes Museum on September 13, 2007. This museum houses Stokes memorabilia, video interviews, miscellaneous video footage, awards and a written history about Stokes and his rise to prominence. The museum is located at Outhwaite Homes, 4302 Quincy Avenue.

From 2006 to 2008, the Western Reserve Historical Society opened an exhibition on the lives of Congressman Stokes and his brother titled &quot;Carl and Louis Stokes: From the Projects to Politics&quot;. The exhibit uses photographs, manuscript collections, and personal items to showcase Louis Stokes&#x27; rise from the Outhwaite homes, his legal career, and his Congressional service. The former Congressman was inducted into the Karamu House Hall of Fame in 2007 for his contributions to the continued legacy of Cleveland&#x27;s black settlement house and theatre.

Many buildings throughout the country have been named in Stokes honor including: Howard University&#x27;s medical library, the Cleveland Public Library&#x27;s main building expansion, and the GCRTA&#x27;s Windermere station Louis Stokes Station at Windermere. The greater Cleveland area Veteran&#x27;s hospital was renamed the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Building 50 on the campus of the National Institutes of Health is named the Louis Stokes Laboratories.

Congressman Stokes&#x27; alma mater, Case Western Reserve University, offers the Louis Stokes Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Scholarship worth full tuition to an incoming first-year or transfer undergraduate student. It is intended to help economically and educationally disadvantaged students attain an education at the school.

<doc id="718070" wikidata="Q3525160" url="?curid=718070" title="Thomas Gisborne">
<text>Thomas Gisborne (31 October 1758 – 24 March 1846) was an English Anglican priest and poet. He was a member of the Clapham Sect, who fought for the abolition of the slave trade in England.

==Life==
Gisborne was born at Bridge Gate, Derby, the son of John Gisborne of Yoxhall Lodge in Needwood Forest, Staffordshire and his wife Anne Bateman. He was educated at Harrow and entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1776, where he established lifelong friendships with William Wilberforce and Thomas Babington. At Cambridge, he became the first Chancellor&#x27;s medallist in 1780.

In 1783 he became curate of Barton-under-Needwood in Staffordshire, and later that year inherited Yoxall Lodge, also in Staffordshire, which was 3 miles from the church. The next year he married Mary Babington (b. 1760), only sister of Thomas Babington. They had six sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Thomas Gisborne (1794–1852), became a member of parliament, and the fourth son, James, a clergyman, succeeded his father as perpetual curate of Barton in 1820.

Gisborne was a central figure in the Clapham Sect, an abolitionist group which included William Wilberforce and Gisborne&#x27;s brother-in-law Thomas Babington. Yoxall Lodge acted as a major focus of the group, and Wilberforce was a frequent visitor there.

Gisborne was appointed prebendary of Durham Cathedral in 1823. He died at Yoxall Lodge on 24 March 1846 at the age of eighty-seven. Gisborne left money for an annual scholarship at the University of Durham, which is referred to as the Gisborne Scholarship.

==Writing==

Gisborne&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Moral Philosophy&quot; (1789) was a forceful evangelical attack on William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy&quot; (1785), an influential work studied at both Cambridge and Oxford Universities, arguing morality as a categorical imperative against Paley&#x27;s utilitarian standpoint. Gisborne also wrote &quot;Enquiry into the Duties of Men&quot; (1795) and &quot;Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex&quot; (1797) stressing subordination to the divinely imposed social hierarchy.

<text>Noah Raam Feldman (born May 22, 1970) is an American legal scholar and academic. He is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows. He is the author of 10 books, host of the podcast &quot;Deep Background&quot;, and a public affairs columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. He was formerly a contributing writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Feldman&#x27;s work is focused on ethics and constitutional law with an emphasis on innovation, free speech, law and religion, and history.

==Early life and education==
Feldman grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in an Orthodox Jewish home. Feldman studied Near Eastern languages and civilizations at Harvard University. In 1990, as a junior, he was the Massachusetts recipient of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship. Feldman graduated first in his class in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, and Phi Beta Kappa membership.

Upon graduating from Harvard, Feldman was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1994, he earned a Doctor of Philosophy in Oriental Studies (focusing on Aristotle&#x27;s Ethics and its Islamic reception). While at Oxford, he was a member of the Oxford University L&#x27;Chaim Society. Feldman then returned to the United States to attend Yale Law School, where he was the book review editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. He graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1997. 

He has been called a &quot;hyperpolyglot&quot; and is fluent in English, Hebrew, Arabic, and French. He also speaks conversational Korean, and reads Greek, Latin, German, Italian, Spanish and Aramaic.

==Career==

=== Legal career ===
After graduating from law school, Feldman was a law clerk for Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, then for Justice David Souter of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.

In 2001, Feldman joined the faculty of New York University Law School, where he became a tenured full professor in 2005 and was appointed Cecilia Goetz Professor of Law in 2006.

In 2007, Feldman joined the Harvard Law School faculty as the Bemis Professor of International Law, teaching classes on the First Amendment, the Constitution, and the international order. In 2014, he was appointed the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

Feldman was a senior adjunct fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and was previously an adjunct fellow at New America Foundation.

=== Writer and author ===
Feldman has published ten nonfiction books and two case books.

They include &quot;The Broken Constitution&quot;, &quot;Divided By God,&quot; &quot;What We Owe Iraq&quot;, &quot;Cool War&quot;, &quot;Scorpions&quot;, &quot;The Three Lives of James Madison&quot; and &quot;The Arab Winter&quot;. Reviewing &quot;The Arab Winter&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert F. Worth called Feldman&#x27;s thesis &quot;bold&quot; and that Feldman &quot;spins out its ramifications in fascinating and persuasive ways.&quot; Reviewing &quot;The Broken Constitution&quot;, James Oakes concludes that Feldman ignores &quot;the voluminous historical evidence that would have added some much-needed nuance to his thoroughly unpersuasive analysis.&quot;

He was a contributing writer for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; from 2005 to 2011.

Since 2012, he has been a regular columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. He also regularly contributes essays to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; about constitutional topics and the Supreme Court.

=== Podcast host ===
Since 2019, Feldman has been the host of the podcast &quot;Deep Background&quot;, which is produced by Pushkin Industries. &quot;Deep Background&quot; focuses on the historical, scientific, legal, and cultural context underlying the news, with a focus on power and ethics. He has interviewed Malcolm Gladwell, Laurie R. Santos, and Marc Lipsitch, among others.

=== Organizations and affiliations ===
In 2003, he was named senior constitutional advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. In that capacity he advised on the drafting of the Transitional Administrative Law, the precursor to the Iraqi constitution.

In 2010, he became a senior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows, and in 2020, he was named chair. A Harvard Magazine profile describes the Society as such: &quot;The values it represents to [Feldman] have shaped his career: &#x27;convivial intellectual community with people from many very different backgrounds; interdisciplinary creativity and collaboration; openness to new, unorthodox ideas; pursuing solutions to long-term questions that really matter for the world; generosity to colleagues and across generations; nurturing originality to encourage risk-taking; and belief in sustained, in-person conversation as a central element of the good intellectual life.&#x27;&quot;

He is the founding director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Program on Jewish &amp; Israeli Law at Harvard Law School.

=== Facebook Oversight Board ===
Feldman advised Facebook on the creation of its Oversight Board, whose members were announced in June 2020. Feldman proposed the idea of the oversight board to his friend Sheryl Sandberg in 2018 and shortly thereafter gave a presentation to Facebook&#x27;s corporate board about the idea, at Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s invitation. According to Feldman, the purpose of the Oversight Board is to protect and ensure freedom of expression on the platform by creating an independent body to review Facebook&#x27;s most important content moderation decisions.

A 2020 profile in Harvard magazine describes the genesis of the board: &quot;On a bike ride one day, [Feldman] thought: Facebook and other social media are under a lot of pressure to avoid outcomes that are morally repugnant. What if they addressed the problem as governments do, giving independent bodies functioning like courts the authority to decide what content is acceptable and what is not? Social media &quot;themselves&quot;, he decided, should find ways to protect free expression—and he made a proposal to Facebook, the world’s largest social-media platform, with more than 2.6 billion users who send out an average of 115 billion messages a day: &#x27;To put it simply: we need a Supreme Court of Facebook.&#x27;&quot;

=== Trump testimony ===
On December 4, 2019, Feldman—alongside law professors Pamela Karlan, Michael Gerhardt, and Jonathan Turley—testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. &quot;Some day, we will no longer be alive, and we will go wherever it is we go, the good place or the other place, and we may meet there Madison and Hamilton,&quot; Feldman suggested. &quot;And they will ask us, &#x27;When the president of the United States acted to corrupt the structure of the republic, what did you do?&#x27; And our answer to that question must be that we followed the guidance of the framers, and it must be that if the evidence supports that conclusion, that the House of Representatives moves to impeach him.&quot;

==Public perception==

=== Media ===
In 2020, &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot; wrote of Feldman, a Harvard professor, &quot;Feldman is increasingly prominent as a public intellectual and a voice about public affairs ... His work displays the mix of synthesis and substantive mastery that serious journalists aspire to, and the combination of clarity and eloquence that few scholars display. He writes with the conviction that the most important public position in American life is that of citizen, which makes his fellow citizens the most important audience for his writing about American public affairs.&quot;

In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published in &quot;Who Is Noah Feldman?&quot; that Feldman was &quot;part of a vanishing breed, a public intellectual equally at ease with writing law review articles, books aimed at both popular and scholarly audiences and regular opinion columns, all leaning left but with a distinct contrarian streak.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Feldman &quot;specializes in constitutional law and the relationship between law and religion and free speech&quot;.

In 2008, Feldman was named in &quot;Esquire&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;75 most influential people of the 21st century.&quot; The magazine called him &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most sought after authorities,&quot; &quot;an acclaimed author&quot; and &quot;a public intellectual of our time.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; named Feldman &quot;the next big public intellectual,&quot; and later, as &quot;most beautiful brainiac&quot; in The Most Beautiful People issue.

In 2005, &quot;The New York Observer&quot; called Feldman &quot;one of a handful of earnest, platinum-résumé&#x27;d law geeks whose prospects for the Big Bench are the source of constant speculation among friends and colleagues&quot;.

===Criticism of Modern Orthodox Judaism===
In a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article, &quot;Orthodox Paradox&quot;, Feldman recounted his experiences of the boundaries of inclusion and exclusion of the Modern Orthodox Jewish community in which he was raised, specifically at his high school alma mater, the Maimonides School. He contended that his choice to marry a non-Jew led to ostracism by the school, in which he and his then-girlfriend were allegedly removed from the 1998 photograph of his class reunion published in the school newsletter. His marriage to a non-Jew is contrary to orthodox Jewish law, although he and his family had been active members of the Harvard Orthodox minyan. The photographer&#x27;s account of an over-crowded photograph was used to accuse Feldman of misrepresenting a fundamental fact in the story, namely whether he was &quot;purposefully&quot; cropped out of the picture, as many other class members were also cropped from the newsletter photograph due to space limitations. His supporters noted that Feldman&#x27;s claim in the article was that he and his girlfriend were &quot;nowhere to be found&quot; and not that they were cropped or deleted out of the photograph. 

His critique of Modern Orthodox Judaism has been commented on by many, including Hillel Halkin, columnist for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;; Andrew Silow-Carroll, editor of the &quot;New Jersey Jewish News&quot;; Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union; Marc B. Shapiro Rabbi Shalom Carmy, tenured professor of Jewish philosophy at Yeshiva University; Rabbi Norman Lamm, chancellor of Yeshiva University; Rabbi Shmuley Boteach; Gary Rosenblatt, editor of &quot;Jewish Week&quot;, the editorial board of the &quot;Jewish Press&quot;; Rabbis Ozer Glickman and Aharon Kahn, roshei yeshiva at Yeshiva University; Ami Eden, executive editor of The Forward; Rabbi David M. Feldman, author of &quot;Where There&#x27;s Life, There&#x27;s Life&quot;; and Jonathan Rosenblum, columnist for the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;.

==Publications==
===Books===
Feldman has published ten nonfiction books and two casebooks.

* &quot;To Be a Jew Today: A New Guide to God, Israel, and the Jewish People&quot; (2024).
* &quot;The Broken Constitution: Lincoln, Slavery, and the Refounding of America&quot; (2021) &quot;seeks to retell the story of the meaning of the Constitution in the Civil War and of Lincoln’s decisive action not as the story of successful salvation but as something more dramatic, and more extreme: the frank breaking and frank remaking of the entire union of order, rights, constitution, and liberty.&quot; The book is a history of &quot;an extraordinary transformation&quot; in Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;beliefs about the meaning of the Constitution&quot;.
* &quot;The Arab Winter: A Tragedy&quot; (2020) seeks to &quot;save the Arab spring from the verdict of implicit nonexistence and to propose an alternative account that highlights the exercise of collective, free political action.&quot; The book &quot;is an interdisciplinary work of history and sociology, as well as linguistics, using insights of political philosophy to explore the right ways of governing in the very different countries of Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia, as well as the Islamic State.&quot;
* &quot;The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President&quot; (2017) &quot;explores Madison&#x27;s reactive and improvisational thinking as it played out in the three uniquely consequential roles, or ‘lives,&#x27; he had — as constitutional architect and co-author with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay of the ‘Federalist Papers,&#x27; political partisan and wartime president.&quot; Feldman writes that Madison&#x27;s &quot;character emerges most vividly through the cycles of [his] extraordinarily close friendships&quot; and that his biography is &quot;entwined with that of the constitutional republic itself, its personalities, and its permanent struggle to reconcile unity with profound disagreement.&quot;
* &quot;Cool War: The Future of Global Competition&quot; (2013) is about the relationship between the United States and China, as &quot;the world&#x27;s two biggest economies are fated to remain geopolitical frenemies, locked in a chilly embrace necessitated by economic interdependence but made tense by constant military and political rivalry in Asia and, increasingly, the rest of the world.&quot; As each side vies for supremacy, Feldman warns, the Cool War has the potential to become a hot war.
* &quot;Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR&#x27;s Great Supreme Court Justices&quot; (2010) focuses on four of Roosevelt&#x27;s Supreme Court appointees: Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black, Robert Jackson, and William O. Douglas, and &quot;how the backgrounds, personalities, and experiences of the four justices shaped their philosophies and how those philosophies changed the Court from a conservative one resisting America&#x27;s liberal turn under FDR into the liberal one that helped remake the nation&quot;. This group biography demonstrates that their competing judicial philosophies &quot;are the ones that continue to preoccupy lawyers, law professors and judges&quot;.
* &quot;The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State&quot; (2008) explains the increasingly loud call for implementing shari&#x27;a in Muslim countries. Feldman argues that current systems of government in certain Muslim countries have unchecked executive power because the previous system – in which scholarly interpretation of shari&#x27;a served to counterbalance executive power – was undermined by failed reforms in the modern era. Drawing on the success of this previous system, Feldman proposes a viable path for Islamic governance that depends on legislators to serve as the check on authoritarian executives.
* &quot;Divided By God: America&#x27;s Church-State Problem and What We Should Do About It&quot; (2005) describes &quot;key episodes in the history of church-state relations to show how the growing religious diversity of the American people has led to new efforts to find common ground for political and social life.&quot; Addressing the divide between the competing camps of &quot;values evangelicals&quot; and &quot;legal secularists,&quot; Feldman proposes a compromise &quot;to allow religious symbols in public places but not to allow public funding for specifically religious practices or activities&quot;.
* &quot;What We Owe Iraq: War and the Ethics of Nation Building&quot; (2004) argues that &quot;having broken the Iraqi government, Washington has an obligation to bring about a new and better one&quot; while ensuring that nation building does not become &quot;a paternalistic, colonialist charade.&quot; As a constitutional advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, Feldman suggests the United States ensure security and organize elections before withdrawing.
* &quot;After Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy&quot; (2003) contends that support of violent jihad in the Muslim world is declining in favor of popularity for both Islam and democracy. Explaining shared traits of Islam and democracy, such as equality and flexibility, Feldman argues that the two are in fact compatible and that &quot;democracy in the Arab world should be Islamic in character.&quot;

<doc id="718076" wikidata="Q7549829" url="?curid=718076" title="Soaps In Depth">
<text>Soaps In Depth was an American entertainment magazine, formerly published as a series of biweekly print publications and currently as an online-exclusive publication, that is dedicated to coverage of daytime soap operas. Founded in 1997 by Bauer Publications, it covers current and upcoming soap opera storylines, and features news and feature articles, interviews with performers and principal production staff, and, as a print publication, crossword puzzles.

Differentiating from other soap opera-focused magazines (like &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;) that offered general coverage of all of the daytime serials, &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot; was initially structured as three standalone biweekly publications—ABC Soaps In Depth, CBS Soaps In Depth and NBC Soaps In Depth—that were devoted to only the soap operas on a particular &quot;Big Three&quot; network covered by the corresponding edition, allowing soap viewers to receive more coverage related to the soaps they followed.

The NBC edition was discontinued in December 1999 after the network cancelled two of its three soap operas within months of each other, &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, making it superfluous to cover only two programs (&quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;AW&quot; successor &quot;Passions&quot; respectively); coverage of NBC&#x27;s serials was integrated into the other publications. The ABC and CBS editions continued to be sold for 21 years afterward, even after both networks pared down the number of soaps occupying their respective daytime schedules between 2009 and 2012, leaving ABC with only one serial (&quot;General Hospital&quot;) and CBS with two (&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;).

In April 2020, it was announced that &quot;Soaps in Depth&quot; would cease production of its print magazine but would continue to publish newer content as an online-only publication; the conversion left &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; as the only remaining American soap opera magazine to provide content through both print publication and online distribution.

== Editions ==
=== &quot;CBS Soaps In Depth&quot; ===
First published in early 1997, at the time print publication ceased, &quot;CBS Soaps In Depth&quot; had focused only on the CBS soaps &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Previously, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;As The World Turns&quot; were covered as well before their respective cancellations (in 2009 and 2010). Each issue also included a special section for &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, brief news coverage, previews, and recaps for &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Days Of Our Lives&quot;. When the CBS edition debuted, each issue cost $2.99. By the publication&#x27;s closure, the CBS edition cost $3.99 American and $4.50 Canadian.

=== &quot;ABC Soaps In Depth&quot; ===
First published in February 1997, this magazine focused on the ABC soaps at that time (&quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;The City&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;). One month after the release of the debut issue, ABC cancelled &quot;The City&quot;; &quot;ABC Soaps In Depth&quot; later coverage began on its replacement, &quot;Port Charles&quot;, when the &quot;General Hospital&quot; spin-off premiered in June with coverage of &quot;PC&quot; continuing until the series was cancelled in 2003. The ABC edition also includes news coverage, previews, and recaps for the CBS soaps and &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;. The magazine initially cost $2.99 per issue, with occasional issues sold at a discount to $1.00; beginning in 2003, each issue cost $3.99.

After the cancellations of &quot;AMC&quot; and &quot;OLTL&quot; in 2011 and 2012, respectively (leaving &quot;GH&quot; as the ABC&#x27;s only remaining daytime soap, a status it maintains to this day), the ABC edition began to also include brief sections for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and the CBS soaps.

=== &quot;NBC Soaps In Depth&quot; ===
&quot;NBC Soaps In Depth&quot; focused its coverage on NBC Daytime&#x27;s soap line-up, then consisting of &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and the fledgling &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. Two of the soaps covered by the NBC edition were cancelled within a span of several months during 1999: NBC first cancelled the long-running &quot;AW&quot; to make room for the in-house production &quot;Passions&quot; and subsequently canned &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; due to low ratings (electing to replace it with &quot;Later Today&quot;, a lifestyle talk show developed as an extension of &quot;Today&quot;); although the network continued to maintain two serials thereafter (until &quot;Passions&quot; moved to The 101 Network in 2008 to accommodate a fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot;, leaving &quot;Days&quot; as NBC&#x27;s only remaining serial), the consequence of NBC Daytime&#x27;s drastic moves led Bauer Publications to determine a separate NBC-focused magazine was no longer feasible.

Coverage of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; and, until its cancellation, &quot;Passions&quot; (consisting of news and feature articles, previews, and recaps for each show) was folded into the ABC and CBS editions; at the time &quot;Soaps in Depth&quot; ended print distribution, &quot;Days&quot; received more coverage in the ABC edition, as ABC itself only has one soap opera remaining on its daytime schedule (&quot;General Hospital&quot;).

<doc id="718080" wikidata="Q153221" url="?curid=718080" title="Yunlin County">
<text>Yunlin County (Mandarin pinyin: &quot;Yúnlín Xiàn&quot;; Taigi POJ: &quot;Hûn-lîm-koān&quot;; Hakka PFS: &quot;Yùn-lìm-yen&quot;) is a county in western Taiwan. Yunlin County borders the Taiwan Strait to the west, Nantou County to the east, Changhua County to the north at the Zhuoshui River, and Chiayi County to the south at the Beigang River. It has a population of 664,963 as of 2022.

Yunlin is part of the Chianan Plain, a flat land known for its agriculture. Agricultural products of Yunlin County include pomelo, tea leaves, suan cai, papaya and melon. Yunlin&#x27;s rivers give it potential for hydroelectricity. Douliu is the largest and capital city of Yunlin. It is the only county on the main island of Taiwan where no city with the same name exists. Yunlin is one of the least developed counties on the West coast, and suffers from emigration.

==History==

===Dutch Formosa===
During the Dutch Formosa era, &quot;Ponkan&quot; (modern-day Beigang) was an important coastal castle.

===Qing Dynasty===
Yunlin County was established during the Qing Dynasty. Liu Mingchuan was in charge of Taiwan, which had been divided into three counties since 1683, Yunlin being part of Zhuluo County. Mountains made transportation and communication between bordering counties (Changhua and Chiayi) difficult, so Liu suggested a new county, called Yunlin, for easier management. In 1887, Yunlin became one of the four counties of the new Taiwan Prefecture.

===Empire of Japan===
During Japanese rule, Yunlin (as &quot;Unrin&quot;) County was again abolished due to the resistance from the local people and combined with Tainan Prefecture. However, continued to be an important city of central Taiwan.

===Republic of China===
The Yunlin area remained under Tainan County after the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945. On 16 August 1950, Yunlin County was separated from Tainan County, with Douliu Township as the county seat. On 25 December 1981, Douliu Township was upgraded to a county-administered city. Yunlin is the only county on Taiwan island without a city of the same name. Like the rest of Taiwan, Yunlin is nominally a part of Taiwan Province, Republic of China, although the provincial level of government is functionally obsolete.

==Geography==
Yunlin County is located in the central-south portion of western Taiwan and is at the northern tip of the Chianan Plain. The county is bordered by Nantou County to the east, the Taiwan Strait to the west, Chiayi County to the south separated by the Beigang River, and Changhua County to the north separated by the Zhuoshui River.

<text>An off-road vehicle (ORV), also known as an off-highway vehicle (OHV), overland vehicle, or adventure vehicle, is a vehicle specifically designed to traverse unpaved roads and surfaces, such as trails, forest roads, and other low-traction surfaces. Off-road vehicles have gained popularity through competitive events such as the annual Dakar Rally, which challenges drivers to navigate diverse and extreme terrain across multiple countries.

==History==

One of the earliest modified off-road vehicles was the Kégresse track, a conversion developed by Adolphe Kégresse while working for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916. The system employed a caterpillar track with a flexible belt instead of interlocking metal segments, which could be fitted to a conventional vehicle, turning it into a half-track suitable for rough or soft terrain.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Kégresse returned to France and the system was used on Citroën cars between 1921 and 1937 for off-road and military vehicles. Citroën sponsored several overland expeditions with these vehicles, crossing North Africa and Central Asia.

The Antarctic Snow Cruiser, a large-wheeled vehicle designed 1937-1939 under the direction of Thomas Poulter, was intended for transport in Antarctica. While the project incorporated novel features, it faced operational difficulties in the harsh Antarctic conditions, eventually leading to its discontinuation.

The Jeeps in particular were popular with buyers who used them as utility vehicles. This was also the start of off-roading as a hobby. The wartime Jeeps soon wore out, though, and the Jeep company started to produce civilian derivatives, closely followed by similar vehicles from British Land Rover and Japanese Toyota, Datsun/Nissan, Suzuki, and Mitsubishi. These were all similar: small, compact, four-wheel-drive vehicles with at most a small hardtop to protect the occupants from the elements.

Early off-road vehicles, like the U.S. Jeep Wagoneer and Ford Bronco; the British Range Rover; and the Japanese Toyota Land Cruiser, Nissan Patrol, and Suzuki&#x27;s LJ series; featured bodies similar to those of a station wagon but on a light truck-like frame, with four-wheel-drive drivetrains. As off-road vehicles increased in popularity during the 1990s, more companies began producing their own lines of what became known as Sport Utility Vehicles. Manufacturers started incorporating more features to make off-road vehicles competitive with regular vehicles in the consumer market, which eventually evolved into the modern SUV and the newer crossover vehicle, where Off-roading capabilities were reduced in favor of improved on-road handling and luxury.

==Technical details==

To effectively navigate off the pavement, off-road vehicles require low ground pressure, high ground clearance, and the ability to maintain wheels or track contact on uneven surfaces. Wheeled vehicles achieve this through large or additional tires, combined with high and compliant suspension. Tracked vehicles use wide tracks and flexible suspension on the road wheels.
The choice between wheels and tracks depends on cost and suitability. Tracked drivetrains are more expensive to produce and maintain but offer superior off-road performance, while wheeled drivetrains are cheaper and allow for higher speeds.

Tires are crucial for wheeled off-road vehicles, and off-road tire tread types vary based on the terrain. Common types include A/T (All Terrain) and M/T (Mud Terrain). A/T tires perform well on sand but are less effective in mud. Sand Blaster and Mud bogging tires are used for challenging terrains like dirt, sand, and water to ensure traction at high angles and speeds (off-road motorsport).

Most off-road vehicles are equipped with low gearings, allowing the operator to optimize the engine&#x27;s available power for slow movement through difficult terrain. An internal combustion engine coupled to a standard gearbox often has an output speed that is too high, which is resolved by using a very low (&quot;granny&quot;) first gear (as in all-wheel drive Volkswagen Transporter versions) or an additional gearbox in line with the first, known as a reduction drive. Some vehicles, such as the Bv206, also have torque converters to reduce the gearing.

==Criticism==

===Safety===

Sport utility vehicles have a higher center of gravity, making them more prone to rollover accidents than standard passenger cars. A study in the United States found that SUVs have twice the fatality rate of passenger cars and nearly triple the fatality rate in rollover accidents.

In the United States, light trucks (including SUVs) account for 36 percent of all registered vehicles and are involved in about half of all fatal two-vehicle crashes with passenger cars. In 80 percent of these crashes, the fatalities are occupants of the passenger cars.

===Environment===
In the United States, the number of ORV users has increased sevenfold since 1972, from five million to 36 million in 2000. Government policies that aim to protect wilderness while allowing recreational ORVs have been a subject of debate in the United States and other countries.

All trail and off-trail activities affect natural vegetation and wildlife, leading to erosion, invasive species, habitat loss, and ultimately, species loss, which reduces an ecosystem&#x27;s ability to maintain homeostasis. ORVs cause more environmental stress than foot traffic alone, and ORV operators who attempt to challenge natural obstacles can cause significantly more damage than those who stay on legal trails. Illegal off-road vehicle use is a serious land management issue, comparable to illegal garbage dumping and other forms of vandalism. Organizations such as Tread Lightly! and the Sierra Club promote responsible trail ethics.

ORVs have also been criticized for creating excessive pollution in otherwise pristine areas, as well as noise pollution that can impair hearing and stress wildlife. In 2002, the United States Environmental Protection Agency adopted emissions standards for all-terrain vehicles that, &quot;when fully implemented in 2012, [...they] are expected to prevent the release of more than two million tons of air pollution each year—the equivalent of removing the pollution from more than 32 million cars every year.&quot;
==Civilian use==
Common commercial vehicles used for off-roading include four-wheel-drive pickup trucks and SUVs such as the Ford F-Series, Jeep Wrangler, and Toyota Land Cruiser, among others. Owners often modify the wheels, tires, suspension, and body to improve off-road performance. Decommissioned military vehicles such as the Jeep CJ and the AM General Hummer have also been repurposed for civilian use. Some vehicles, like early Land Rovers, were adapted for military use from civilian versions. Specialized off-road vehicles include Utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), All-terrain vehicles (ATVs), dirt bikes, dune buggies, rock crawlers vehicles, and sandrails.
=== All-terrain vehicle ===
==Other applications==
===Military vehicle===
The military market for off-road vehicles was once substantial, but has diminished since the the fall of the Iron Curtain in the 1990s. The U.S. jeeps, developed during World War II, popularized the term &quot;jeep&quot; for any light off-road vehicle. In the U.S., the Jeep&#x27;s successor from the mid-1980s was the AM General HMMWV series. The Red Army used the GAZ-61 and GAZ-64 during World War II, while the Eastern Bloc used the GAZ-69 and UAZ-469 in similar roles.

<doc id="718088" wikidata="Q2440618" url="?curid=718088" title="Saudia Flight 163">
<text>Saudia Flight 163 was a scheduled Saudia passenger flight departing from Quaid-e-Azam Airport in Karachi, Pakistan, bound for Kandara Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, via Riyadh International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which caught fire after takeoff from Riyadh International Airport (now the Riyadh Air Base) on 19 August 1980. Although the Lockheed L-1011-200 TriStar made a successful emergency landing at Riyadh, the flight crew failed to perform an emergency evacuation of the airplane, leading to the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew on board the aircraft from smoke inhalation.

The accident is the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, and the deadliest to occur in Saudi Arabia. At the time, this was the second-deadliest aircraft accident in the history of aviation involving a single airplane after Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and the third-deadliest overall.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved in the accident was a Lockheed L-1011-200 TriStar, registered in Saudi Arabia as HZ-AHK with serial number 1169. The aircraft was certified on 23 July 1979 and was delivered to Saudia nearly a month later. It had accumulated a total of 3,023 flight hours and 1,759 cycles. HZ-AHK was equipped with three Rolls Royce RB211-524 engines with each having an average of 4,000 total engine hours.

== Passengers and crew ==
Of the flight&#x27;s passengers, 82 boarded in Karachi, while the remaining 205 boarded in Riyadh. The majority of the passengers were Saudis and Pakistani religious pilgrims on their way to Mecca. In addition to the Saudis and Pakistanis, 32 religious pilgrims were from Iran. Also, a small number of passengers were from various countries, who were heading to Jeddah for diplomatic missions.

There was a total of three crew members in the flight deck: 

* The captain of the flight was 38-year-old Mohammed Khowyter (), a Saudi who was hired by Saudia in 1965. He had flown numerous aircraft such as the Douglas DC-3 and DC-4, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, and the Boeing 707 and 737. Khowyter&#x27;s records described him as a slow learner and needing more proper training. Khowyter had 7,674 flying hours, including 388 hours in the TriStar.

* The first officer was 26-year-old Sami Hasanain (), also a Saudi, who joined the airline in 1977 and had previously worked as a trainee. He received his type rating on the TriStar 11 days before the accident. At one point during his training, however, Hasanain was removed from flying school for poor performance. Hasanain had 1,615 flying hours, including 125 hours in the TriStar.

* The flight engineer was 42-year-old Bradley Curtis (born Zdzisław Szczęsny), a Polish-born American who was hired by the airline in 1974. He had been qualified as a captain of the Douglas DC-3 and was then assigned to train in either the Boeing 707 or 737 but failed to qualify either as a captain or as a first officer because he did not meet the requirements. He had needed to pay for his own training as an L-1011 flight engineer to keep his job. Curtis had 650 flying hours, including 157 hours in the TriStar.

==Accident ==
Flight 163 departed Quaid-e-Azam International Airport (now Jinnah International Airport) in Karachi, Pakistan, at 18:32 Pakistan time (13:32 UTC) bound for Kandara Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a scheduled intermediate stop at Riyadh Airport. The flight arrived in Riyadh at 19:06 Saudi time (16:06 UTC) and had a two-hour layover for refueling. During the layover, several of the passengers disembarked. After refueling, the flight took off at 21:08 (18:08 UTC) bound for Jeddah.

Almost seven minutes into the flight, the crew received warnings of smoke from the cargo compartment. The crew spent the next four minutes trying to confirm the warnings, after which Flight Engineer Curtis went back into the cabin to confirm the presence of smoke. Captain Khowyter decided to return to the airport, and First Officer Hasanain radioed their intentions at 21:20 (18:20 UTC). At 21:25 (18:25 UTC), the thrust lever for the number two engine (the center engine) became jammed as the fire burned through the operating cable. Then, at 21:29 (18:29 UTC), the engine was shut down during final approach.

At 21:35 (18:35 UTC), Khowyter declared an emergency and landed back at Riyadh. After touchdown at 21:36 (18:36 UTC), the airplane continued to a taxiway at the end of the runway where it exited the runway, stopping at 21:39 (18:39 UTC), 2 minutes and 40 seconds after touchdown. The airport fire rescue equipment was stationed back on the landing section of the runway, with emergency personnel expecting an emergency stop and evacuation. This meant they had to rush after the aircraft, which had used the entire length of a runway to slow and then exit onto the taxiway. The airplane stopped facing in the opposite direction from landing.

Once the aircraft had stopped, the crew reported that they were shutting down the engines and about to evacuate. On arrival at the aircraft soon after, however, the rescue personnel found that the two wing-mounted engines were still running, preventing them from opening the doors. These were finally shut down at 21:42 (18:42 UTC), 3 minutes and 15 seconds after the aircraft came to a stop, when communication with the crew was lost. No external fire was visible at this time, but flames were observed through the windows at the rear of the aircraft. Twenty-three minutes after engine shutdown, at 22:05 (19:05 UTC), the R2 door (second door on the right side) was opened by ground personnel. Three minutes later, the interior of the aircraft flashed over, and was destroyed by fire.

Why Captain Khowyter failed to evacuate the aircraft promptly is not known. Saudi reports stated that the crew could not get the plug-type doors to open in time. It is assumed that most passengers and flight attendants were incapacitated during the landing roll, or they did not attempt to open a door on a moving aircraft. The aircraft is known to have remained pressurized during the landing roll as the cabin pressurization system was on standby, and the aircraft was found with both pressurization hatches almost completely closed. The pressurization hatches should have opened completely on touchdown to depressurize the aircraft. The crew were found still in their seats, and all the victims were found in the forward half of the fuselage. Autopsies were conducted on some of the non-Saudi nationals, including the American flight engineer. All of them perished from smoke inhalation and not burns, which indicated that they had died long before the R2 door was opened. The source of the fire in compartment C3 could not be determined.

==Investigation==
The investigation revealed the fire had started in the aft C3 cargo compartment. The fire was intense enough to burn through the cabin floor, causing passengers seated in that area of the cabin to move forward prior to the landing. Saudi officials found two butane stoves in the burned-out remains of the airliner, and a used fire extinguisher near one of them. One early theory was that the fire began in the passenger cabin when a passenger used his own butane stove to heat water for tea. The investigation found no evidence to support this theory.

===Policy changes===
After the event, the airline revised its training and emergency procedures. Lockheed also removed the insulation from above the rear cargo area and added glass laminate structural reinforcement. The US National Transportation Safety Board recommended that aircraft use halomethane extinguishers instead of traditional hand-held fire extinguishers.

====Crew resource management====
Flight 163 encapsulated the further need for the advent of crew resource management. This is evident from the primary lapses in effective communication that prevented the crew from carrying out a final successful evacuation from the aircraft. These lapses are enabled in part by so-called power distances between juniors and superiors in workplace settings, relationships found in all societies, but emphasized more in some than in others. &quot;In high power-distance cultures, juniors do not question superiors and leaders may be autocratic&quot;, leading to situations where a first officer finds it difficult to question decisions made by the captain, conditions that may have been present on Saudia Flight 163. Analysis of the CVR found that a power distance may have taken place, as the captain repeatedly ignored requests from the flight&#x27;s chief purser to order an evacuation. As the aircraft&#x27;s CVR stopped recording before the emergency landing due to fire damage, the exact reason for the captain refusing to order an evacuation is unknown, though his behavior and actions during the flight were found to be contributing factors to the accident.

The power distance phenomenon has the capability of affecting flight safety globally, but as the work performed in the cockpit is markedly dependent upon the ability of one worker to crosscheck the work of another and vice versa, the danger is most apparent in individuals brought up in cultures that traditionally revere high power distances between those in positions of power and their subordinates.

== In popular culture ==
In 1982, the British current-affairs program &quot;World in Action&quot; aired an episode entitled &quot;The Mystery of Flight 163&quot;. This documented the accident and was subsequently used to train pilots in the value of crew resource management.

This accident is covered in season 24, episode 8 of &quot;Mayday&quot; titled &quot;Under Fire&quot; (2024).

* Varig Flight 820 (July 11, 1973) is a flight of the Brazilian airline Varig that departed from Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Orly Airport, in Paris, France. The plane, a Boeing 707, registration PP-VJZ, made an emergency landing on onion fields about 4 km from Orly Airport, because of smoke in the cabin from a fire in a lavatory. The fire caused 123 deaths, with only 11 survivors (10 crew members and a passenger).
* Air Canada Flight 797 (1983) suffered an on-board fire in its aft lavatory, believed to be due to an electrical fault, which began damaging the aircraft&#x27;s systems. The crew managed to successfully land the aircraft, but a flashover fire during the evacuation killed 23 of the 41 passengers on board.
* British Airtours Flight 28M (1985) had to abort takeoff at Manchester Airport due to an uncontained engine failure and engine fire. While an evacuation was ordered and conducted, issues with the evacuation led to 55 of the 182 occupants dying as a result of smoke inhalation.
* ValuJet Flight 592 (May 11, 1996) crashed into the Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami International Airport, due to a fire caused by expired and improperly stored oxygen generators in the cargo hold. The crash resulted in the death of all 110 people on board, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in Florida&#x27;s history and leading to significant changes in airline safety regulations.

<text>Santiago Rafael Luis Manuel José María Derqui Rodríguez (Córdoba June 21, 1809 – Corrientes November 5, 1867) was president of Argentina from March 5, 1860 to November 5, 1861. He was featured on the 10 australes note, which is now obsolete.

==Biography==
The firstborn son of Manuel José María Derqui y García and his wife Ramona Rodríguez y Orduña, Santiago Derqui studied at the Córdoba National University, receiving a degree in law in 1831. At the university he was professor of law, then of philosophy, and finally vice-dean. On May 14, 1845, he married Modesta García de Cossio y Vedoya Lagraña (1825–1885) with whom he had three boys (Manuel Santiago, Simón, and Santiago Martín Antonio) and three girls (Josefa, Justa Dolores Belisaria, and María del Carmen Modesta Leonor).

He was first assistant and then Minister of the government of Corrientes Province under José María Paz. Justo José de Urquiza named him &#x27;Business administrator&#x27; and sent him to Paraguay on a foreign business mission. He became deputy for Córdoba Province. In 1854 Urquiza named him head of the &quot;Ministry of Justice, Education and Public Instruction&quot;, where he worked for the six years of Urquiza&#x27;s mandate, pushing forward the still-emerging nation. He was an active Freemason.

After Urquiza&#x27;s mandate, Derqui became constitutional president. Being from Córdoba and not from Buenos Aires, it was expected that under his rule the continuous revolts of the provincial governments against the federal government would end.

Derqui accepted the revised national constitution with the changes that would favour Buenos Aires, and named the country &quot;República Argentina&quot;.
This and other unpopular policies towards the rest of the country provoked a general discontent in the provinces that led to the Battle of Pavón. Unable to maintain authority, Derqui resigned and fled to Montevideo.

While in exile, Bartolomé Mitre helped him to go back to his wife&#x27;s native city of Corrientes, where he would die a few years later.

<text>Vicente López y Planes (May 3, 1785 – October 10, 1856) was an Argentine writer and politician who acted as interim President of Argentina from July 7 to August 18, 1827. He also wrote the lyrics of the Argentine National Anthem adopted on May 11, 1813.

== Early life ==
Baptized Alejandro Vicente, he never used his first name. López began his primary studies in the San Francisco School, and later studied in the Real Colegio San Carlos, today the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He obtained a doctorate of laws in the University of Chuquisaca. He served as a captain in the Patriotic Regiment during the English invasions. After the Argentine victory he composed a poem entitled &quot;El triunfo argentino&quot; (The Argentine Triumph).

== Political life ==
He participated in the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810, and supported the formation of the Primera Junta. He had good relations with Manuel Belgrano. When the royalist members of the city government of Buenos Aires were expelled, he was elected mayor of the city; he was an enemy of the party of Cornelio Saavedra and one of the creators of the First Triumvirate, of which he was the Treasurer.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.

López was a member of the Constituent Assembly of year XIII, representing Buenos Aires. At the request of the Assembly, he wrote the lyrics to a &quot;patriotic march&quot;, which eventually became the Argentine National Anthem. It was a military march, whose music was composed by the Catalan Blas Parera; it was approved on March 11, 1813. The first public reading was at a tertulia on May 7 in the house of Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson. It displaced a different march, written by Esteban de Luca, which would have been the anthem if not for the more militaristic Lopez.

López participated in the government of Carlos María de Alvear, and with his fall he was sent to prison. He held a few more public offices, and was then named Secretary of the Constituent Congress of 1825, and, a little later, minister for the president Bernardino Rivadavia.

After the scandal of negotiations with the Brazilian Empire, Rivadavia resigned the presidency. In his place, López was elected as caretaker, signing the dissolution of the Congress and calling elections in Buenos Aires. The new governor, Manuel Dorrego took charge of the ministry; this unified the federalists. When Dorrego fell from grace and was executed by firing squad by Juan Lavalle, Lopez was exiled to Uruguay.

== Late years ==
He returned in 1830 as a member of the Tribunal of Justice for Juan Manuel de Rosas. He was president of the Tribunal for many years and, among other things, presided over the judgement of the assassins of Juan Facundo Quiroga.

He was president of the literary salon led by Marcos Sastre, but was not part of the group known as the Generation of &#x27;37, to which belonged his two sons, Vicente Fidel López and Lucio Vicente López.

<text>Liberal elite, also referred to as the metropolitan elite or progressive elite, is a term used to describe politically liberal people whose education has traditionally opened the doors to affluence, wealth and power and who form a managerial elite. It is commonly invoked pejoratively, with the implication that the people who claim to support the rights of the working class are themselves members of the ruling classes and are therefore out of touch with the real needs of the people they say that they support and protect.

==Usage==
===Canada===

Canadian news outlet CBC reported on an event for supporters of Doug Ford (the premier of Ontario). A supporter described elites as &quot;Those that think they&#x27;re better than me&quot;. Doug Ford also described elites as &quot;people who look down on the average, common folk, thinking they&#x27;re smarter and that they know better to tell us how to live our lives&quot;. Alex Marland of the Memorial University of Newfoundland commented on Justin Trudeau&#x27;s popularity with &quot;liberal elites in metropolitan cities&quot; in an article published on ResearchGate entitled &quot;The brand image of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in international context&quot;.

=== China ===
The term &quot;baizuo&quot; (Chinese: 白左) is used to refer to left-liberal ideas commonly associated with White people in the Western world. This term depicts them as unrealistic, out of touch, and loving virtue signalling. It has also been widely used in Taiwan; this term specifically refers to white people in the West who often have higher education levels, liberal views, unrealistic expectations of the real world, and obsession with standing up for minorities even though these minorities are not offended.

==== Hong Kong ====

The term called &quot;&quot; (Chinese: 左膠; Jyutping: &quot;zo2 gaau1&quot;) is widely used for similar effect in Hong Kong, which literally means &quot;left dumbass&quot; or &quot;leftard&quot;. This term began appearing in Hong Kong political discourse in the 2010s, first in traditional media outlets and quickly spreading to online communication. This term refers to those who advocate peace, equality and non-violence in an unrealistic way only to satisfy their moral superiority. Their ideas are too lofty and sometimes ignore the imperfections of the real world in pursuit of their unrealistic dream.

===India===

In India, the term &#x27;liberal elite&#x27; is used to describe the English speaking, left-leaning establishment, aligned to Nehruvian socialism and Marxism, who have formed much of the mainstream intelligentsia and the ruling political class of India since its independence in 1947. The Indian National Congress, often referred to as the &#x27;Grand Old Party&#x27; of India, is a left-liberal party, which has dominated Indian politics for much of the country&#x27;s independent history.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the term &quot;Bangsar Bubble&quot; is used to describe affluent Malay youth, usually highly educated and high-income groups (mostly T20 with M40 factions), notably in the Bangsar area of the Klang Valley. The term was initially used by leftists to criticize liberals who lack class analysis, but soon that term was appropriated to also refer to Malays who have embraced the Western left&#x27;s progressive thinking. The group is usually associated with advocating some Western progressive issues such as LGBT rights (a taboo topic in the country), human rights, secularism, and racial issues. In terms of social media, they often use Twitter instead of Facebook, the latter of which is dominated by conservatives. The group usually endorses the Pakatan Harapan coalition or the Malaysian United Democratic Alliance.

===South Korea===
&quot;Gangnam Leftist&quot; () refers to the highly educated and high-income class with left-liberal tendencies in South Korean politics and society. They are mainly composed of upper-class members of the 386 Generation. In South Korea, the term is used with the same meaning as &quot;limousine liberal&quot; (). They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Gangnam liberals&quot;, after the wealthy Gangnam region of Seoul, and are differentiated from South Korea&#x27;s traditional socialist and social democratic factions centered on the labor movement.

&quot;Gangnam leftist&quot; is a political term in South Korea, but it is also often used to refer to liberal politicians in countries other than South Korea. For example, Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden have been referred to as Gangnam leftists in South Korean media.

===Philippines===
The Tagalog term &quot;dilawan&quot;, which means &#x27;yellow ones&#x27; in reference to the color of liberalism as an ideology and movement (cf., &quot;pulahan&quot; for &#x27;Reds&#x27;), is used to describe a &quot;discredited brand of transactional reform politics&quot; &quot;en vogue&quot; since the 1986 People Power Revolution (EDSA I). EDSA I, also known as the Yellow Revolution, has been disdained by detractors as a &quot;revolution of mere elites rather than a revolution of the whole people&quot;, and one which &quot;ignor[ed] the existence of the toiling masses and peasants in agrarian Philippines&quot;. The term&#x27;s usage originated in the 1980s as a pejorative for Liberal Party loyalists and politically aligned groups or individuals, often associated with the genteel English-speaking elite. It gained renewed currency during the 2016 Philippine presidential election among hardline supporters of Rodrigo Duterte. In the country&#x27;s English-language political-economic discourse, &quot;liberal elite&quot; is the term employed.

More than a decade prior to Duterte&#x27;s election, in January 2001, the EDSA II protests, which have been denounced by critics as unrepresentative and elitist, culminated in the resignation under pressure of then-president Joseph Estrada and the installation of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as his successor. Arroyo, educated abroad and fluent in multiple colonial languages, was highly regarded in liberal elite circles in contrast to Estrada, a university dropout whose proficiency in English was wanting. Populist protests against Arroyo would erupt three months later in what came to be known as EDSA III.

Duterte, while fluent in English, has similarly run afoul of the liberal elite, which repeatedly draws attention not only to his questionable antics—deplored by no less than his daughter Sara—but also to his frequent use of gutter language. This aversion, in turn, to gutter language has been criticized as indicative of a socioeconomically privileged upbringing that renders one out of touch with general society. Such attitudes have been described as a desire on the part of the liberal elite to &quot;demonize&quot; detractors by portraying them as somehow morally or intellectually deficient, as well as incapable of critical thought. 

Estrada has since come out as a supporter of Duterte, expressing concern that the latter, like himself, might be driven out of office by whom he had referred to years earlier as the &quot;rich and perfumed&quot;. Others have echoed Estrada&#x27;s depiction of those who had deposed him, notwithstanding Estrada&#x27;s own membership in albeit another section of the broader Philippine elite, or have similarly denounced what has been described as the moralism and sham decency of the liberal elite. Ultimately, Duterte&#x27;s rise to power has come to be seen as the &quot;people&#x27;s verdict&quot; on both the failures of the liberal order and what has been felt as the glibness of its domestic champions.

===United Kingdom===
The liberal elite is referred to by various terms in British political discourse. &quot;Hampstead Socialist&quot; and &quot;Hampstead liberal&quot; have been used, referring to the North London area of Hampstead. 

The term &quot;Hampstead Socialist&quot; was regularly used by Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National Party and the phrase &quot;North London metropolitan liberal elite&quot; has been used by Home Secretary Priti Patel. Due to the high Jewish population of this area, references to &quot;North London&quot; elites have been accused by some, such as the Jewish Labour Movement, as a form of coded antisemitism.

Another term that has gained currency is &quot;Islington set&quot;. Emily Thornberry, Labour Party MP for Islington South and Finsbury, resigned as a member of the Shadow Cabinet on 20 November 2014 during the Rochester and Strood by-election, in which she tweeted a picture of a house draped with England flags and a white van parked outside with the caption &#x27;Image from Rochester&#x27;, thought by many to be a snobby jibe. Simon Danczuk, the then-Labour MP for Rochdale, commented that Thornberry&#x27;s tweet furthers the perception that the Labour Party &quot;has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite&quot;.

===United States===

In the United States, the sterotypical lifestyle of the liberal elite is often referenced in popular culture. Columnist Dave Barry drew attention to these stereotypes when he commented, &quot;Do we truly believe that ALL red-state residents are ignorant racist fascist knuckle-dragging NASCAR-obsessed cousin-marrying roadkill-eating tobacco-juice-dribbling gun-fondling religious fanatic rednecks; or that ALL blue-state residents are godless unpatriotic pierced-nose Volvo-driving France-loving left-wing communist latte-sucking tofu-chomping holistic-wacko neurotic vegan weenie perverts?&quot;

A 2004 political advertisement from the right-wing organization Club for Growth attacked the Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean by portraying him as part of the liberal elite: &quot;Howard Dean should take his tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, &quot;New York Times&quot;–reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show back to Vermont, where it belongs.&quot;

Those Americans who equate intellectual pursuits and careers with elitism often point out American intellectuals, most of whom are upper-middle-class not upper-class, are primarily liberal. , approximately 72% of professors identify themselves as liberals. At Ivy League universities, an even larger majority, 87% of professors identified themselves as liberals. People with postgraduate degrees are increasingly Democratic.

<text>Selman Abraham Waksman (July 22, 1888 – August 16, 1973) was a Jewish American inventor, Nobel Prize laureate, biochemist and microbiologist whose research into the decomposition of organisms that live in soil enabled the discovery of streptomycin and several other antibiotics. A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University for four decades, he discovered several antibiotics (and introduced the modern sense of that word to name them), and he introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others. The proceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for microbiological research, which established the Waksman Institute of Microbiology located at the Rutgers University Busch Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey (USA). In 1952, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &quot;ingenious, systematic, and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin.&quot; Waksman and his foundation later were sued by Albert Schatz, one of his Ph.D. students and the discoverer of streptomycin, for minimizing Schatz&#x27;s role in the discovery.

In 2005, Selman Waksman was granted an ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more than 15 antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective treatment for tuberculosis.

==Early life and education==
Selman Waksman was born on July 22, 1888 (July 8 according to the old Russian calendar), to Jewish parents, in Nova Pryluka, Kyiv Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. He was the son of Fradia (London) and Jacob Waksman. In 1910, shortly after receiving his diploma from the Fifth Gymnasium in Odesa, he immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized American citizen six years later.

Waksman attended Rutgers College (now Rutgers University), where he graduated in 1915 with a Bachelor of Science in agriculture. He continued his studies at Rutgers, receiving a Master of Science the following year, in 1916. During his graduate study, he worked under J. G. Lipman at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers performing research in soil bacteriology. Waksman spent some months in 1915–1916 at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC under Charles Thom, studying soil fungi. He was appointed as a research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1918 he was awarded his doctor of philosophy in biochemistry.

==Career==
He joined the faculty at Rutgers University in the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology.

At Rutgers, Waksman&#x27;s team discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, candidin. Waksman co-discovered streptomycin with Albert Schatz. Streptomycin was the first effective drug against gram-negative bacteria and the first antibiotic used to cure tuberculosis. Waksman is credited with coining the term antibiotics to describe antibacterials derived from other living organisms, for example penicillin, though the term was used by the French dermatologist François Henri Hallopeau, in 1871 to describe a substance opposed to the development of life.

In 1931, Waksman organized the division of Marine Bacteriology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in addition to his task at Rutgers. He was appointed a marine bacteriologist there and served until 1942. He was elected a trustee at WHOI and finally a Life Trustee.

In 1951, using half of his patent royalties, Waksman created the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology. At a meeting of the board of trustees of the foundation, held in July 1951, he urged the building of a facility for work in microbiology, named the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, which is located on the Busch Campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. The foundation&#x27;s first president, Waksman, was succeeded in this position by his son, Byron H. Waksman, from 1970 to 2000.

==Research==
===Streptomycin===

Waksman had been studying the Streptomyces family of organisms since his college student days and had, for a time, been studying the organism &quot;Streptomyces griseus&quot;. Streptomycin was isolated from &quot;S. griseus&quot; and found effective against tuberculosis by one of Waksman&#x27;s graduate students, Albert Schatz. These results were later confirmed by Elizabeth Bugie Gregory, whose name was also published on &quot;Streptomycin, a Substance Exhibiting Antibiotic Activity Against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria&quot; with Schatz and Waksman. However, Bugie&#x27;s name was not on the second key paper in 1944, which was regarding the efficacy of streptomycin against tuberculosis in test tubes, as Schatz claimed Bugie was not involved with the experiment. Bugie was also not given credit for her work on streptomycin, nor was she listed on the patent proposal, as she signed an affidavit stating that she did not have any contribution in discovering streptomycin. This was submitted under an attorney of the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation.

====Controversy====

The details and credit for the discovery of streptomycin and its usefulness as an antibiotic were strongly contested by Albert Schatz, leading to litigation in 1950. However, it was possible that Waksman did not see Schatz&#x27;s contribution as significantly as Schatz saw his contributions. Waksman noted that Schatz was away at the military in 1943, adding that he was only in the lab for three months and only played a small role in discovering streptomycin. Waksman and Rutgers settled out of court with Schatz, resulting in financial remuneration and entitlement to &quot;legal and scientific credit as co-discoverer of streptomycin.&quot; Schatz was awarded $120,000 for patent rights and 3% of royalties. &quot;The Lancet&quot; claimed that &quot;the Nobel committee made a considerable mistake by failing to recognize Schatz&#x27;s contribution.&quot;

Systematic experiments to test several strains of antibiotics against several different disease organisms were underway in Waksman&#x27;s laboratory at the time. Their classic approach was to explore a complete matrix with rows consisting of antibiotics and columns consisting of different diseases. The bacteria which produced the antibiotic streptomycin were discovered by Schatz in the farmland outside his lab and tested by him. Waksman, however, eventually came to claim sole credit for the discovery.

The controversy of streptomycin between Waksman and Schatz brought to light the challenges of distributing credit for scientific research, discoveries, and patents. It prompted schools and universities to become more involved in the patenting process and to have more regulations on how credit is dispersed. Schools would also provide clearer lines for each individual&#x27;s role in a lab to minimize future litigations against the school.

===Neomycin===

Neomycin is derived from actinomycetes and was discovered by Waksman and Hubert A. Lechevalier, one of Waksman&#x27;s graduate students. The discovery was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;.

=== Marine bacteria ===
Waksman&#x27;s research also examined the role of bacteria in marine systems, with a particular focus on the role of bacteria in nutrient cycles. Waksman examined the degradation of alginic acid, cellulose, and zooplankton. Waksman, working with Cornelia Carey, Margaret Hotchkiss, Yvette Hardman, and Donald Johnston, conducted multiple studies on the actions of bacteria in marine systems which included quantifying the abundance and viability of bacteria in seawater., examining the impact of copper on bacterial growth, estimating the impact of bacterial activity on the nitrogen cycle, and a separation of bacteria into groups based on habitat use in seawater, on plankton, or in the sediments.

Other tributes involve anti-fouling paint for the Navy, the use of enzymes in laundry detergents, and the practice of Concord grape rootstock to safeguard French vineyards from fungal infections.

==Awards and honors==
Waksman acquired many awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in 1952; the Star of the Rising Sun granted to him by the emperor of Japan, and the rank of &quot;Commandeur&quot; in the French Légion d&#x27;honneur. During his Nobel Prize award presentation, Waksman was called &quot;one of the greatest benefactors to mankind,&quot; as the result of his discovery of streptomycin. Schatz protested being left out of the award, even sending a letter to Gustaf VI Adolf, the King of Sweden, but the State did not have any influence over the Nobel Prize Committee&#x27;s decision and they ruled that he was a mere lab assistant working under a scientist.

The Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology of the National Academy of Sciences is given in his honor.

== Publications ==
Selman Waksman was the author or co-author of over 400 scientific papers, as well as 28 books and 14 scientific pamphlets.

* &quot;Humus: origin, chemical composition, and importance in nature&quot; (1936, 1938)
* &quot;Principles of Soil Microbiology&quot; (1927, 1932)
* &quot;My Life with the Microbes&quot; (1954) (an autobiography)

== Personal life ==
Waksman was married to Deborah B. Mitnik. They had one son, Byron H. Waksman, M.D., who was an assistant professor at Harvard University Medical School, and Professor of Microbiology at Yale University Medical School.

Selman Waksman died on August 16, 1973, at a Hyannis, Massachusetts, hospital and was interred at the Woods Hole Village Cemetery in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
