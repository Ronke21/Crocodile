<text>Goring-by-Sea, commonly referred to simply as Goring, is a neighbourhood of Worthing and former civil parish, now in Worthing district in West Sussex, England. It lies west of West Worthing, about west of Worthing town centre. Historically in Sussex, in the rape of Arundel, Goring has been part of the borough of Worthing since 1929.

==Etymology==
It is thought that the place-name Goring may mean either &#x27;Gāra&#x27;s people&#x27;, or &#x27;people of the wedge-shaped strip of land&#x27;. Usually known as &quot;Goring&quot;, the &quot;by-Sea&quot; suffix has been added to differentiate it from the village of Goring-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

==History==
Around the 6th century Goring became part of the kingdom of Sussex. Like in other villages in the south of Sussex, the people of Goring had land to the north that they used as summer pasture in the Weald, at Goringlee, near Coolham. This route would have been used as a droveways for driving livestock, especially pigs.
The parish of Goring existed at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, under the name &quot;Garinges&quot;. Unlike the other parishes in the area covered by the present Borough of Worthing, which have been in the Rape of Bramber since the 11th century, Goring forms part of the neighbouring Rape of Arundel. (Rapes are the six ancient subdivisions of the county of Sussex, each named after a castle and its associated town.) The former parish of Goring incorporated four manors. The most important of these passed from the Earls of Arundel to Roger de Montalt, 1st Baron Montalt and several other holders.

The former parish of Goring included Castle Goring, a country house built for Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet in the late 1790s.
Intermittent residential development began in the 19th century and continued throughout the 20th century. Although the railway came to Goring in 1846, there were so few passengers using Goring station that it was closed for a period. Goring&#x27;s population expanded after 1929, when it became part of the borough of Worthing, and again in 1938 when the railway was electrified. Over a period of around 50 years, much of old Goring was demolished, although a few buildings survive. Begun shortly before 1939, the Goring Hall estate was developed as a garden city, with concentric crescents near the seafront.

In 1921, the parish had a population of 653. On 1 April 1929, the parish was abolished and merged with Worthing.

==Geography==
Goring has a mixed pebble and sand beach which is a popular beachgoing area for a wide variety of watersports including kitesurfing. The southwest of Goring contains part of the Goring Gap, a protected area of fields and woodland between Goring and Ferring.
The former village of Goring lies in the south of the former parish. North-east of this is the Maybridge estate. North of Maybridge is West Durrington. To the north and west of West Durrington lies Castle Goring, Titnore Wood and the eastern slopes of Highdown Hill, including Highdown Gardens.

==Landmarks==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, the Anglican parish church, was originally built 1100AD as the Church of Our Blessed Ladye of Gorynge, and was rebuilt in 1837 by Decimus Burton for David Lyon of Goring Hall.

The Bull&#x27;s Head on Goring Street has existed as a pub since at least 1770. This may be the same pub that was closed in the early 17th century by puritan-minded Justices of the Peace.

Courtlands was built in the 1820s and was extended around 1906 to 10 by Paul Schweder.

Built around 1889, Goring Hall is a replica of the original building which was built around 1840 for David Lyon, probably designed by Charles Barry, best known for his role in rebuilding the Palace of Westminster in London. Goring Hall is now used as a hospital, operated by BMI Healthcare. An 1840s avenue of holm oaks leads from Goring Hall to St Mary&#x27;s Church.

The English Martyrs&#x27; Catholic Church, dedicated to the English-Catholic Martyrs, has the world&#x27;s only hand-painted copy of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, painted by Gary Bevans between 1987 and 1993.

The red-brick Durrington Bridge House, HM Revenue and Customs&#x27; building near Durrrington-on-Sea station on Barrington Road, holds 900 employees. The site is due to be replaced with homes as HMRC is due to relocate in 2021 to Teville Gate in the centre of Worthing.

==Education==
St Oscar Romero Catholic School on Goring Street is a mixed secondary school that was established in the 1950s. Goring Church of England Primary School is the main primary school for the area. Outside of Goring proper, but within the boundaries of the former parish of Goring is Northbrook College&#x27;s West Durrington campus. Also known as University Centre Worthing, the site has been part of Greater Brighton Metropolitan College since 2017 and provides both further education and higher education.

==Transport==
The A259 runs east–west through Goring, connecting it to the centre of Worthing and Brighton to the east, and Littlehampton and Bognor Regis to the west. The A2032 Littlehampton Road which also runs east–west passes north of Goring proper but within the former parish area. Goring is served by two railway stations: Goring-by-Sea railway station in the west, which opened in 1846, and Durrington-on-Sea railway station in the east, which opened in 1937. Both stations lie on the West Coastway Line and connect Goring to Worthing, Brighton, Littlehampton, London and Southampton.

<text>G.I. Jane is a 1997 American action drama film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Demi Moore, Viggo Mortensen, and Anne Bancroft. The film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo special operations training similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs.

The film was produced by Largo Entertainment, Scott Free Productions, and Caravan Pictures, and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures through the Hollywood Pictures label. Though it received generally favorable reviews and Moore&#x27;s performance received some praise, she still won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress, which is commonly attributed to her role in the critically panned Striptease the year prior.. It opened at No. 1 at the US Box Office, where it remained for two weeks, ultimately breaking even after grossing $98.4 million worldwide on a $50 million budget. The film grossed over $22 million in VHS and DVD rentals. In her autobiography &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Moore called &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; her proudest professional achievement.

==Plot==

A Senate Armed Services Committee interviews a candidate for the position of Secretary of the Navy. Senator Lillian DeHaven from Texas criticizes the Navy for not being gender-neutral. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: if women compare favorably with men in a series of test cases, the military will integrate women fully into all occupations of the Navy.

The first test is the training course of the U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to the SEALs UDT/BUDs). Senator DeHaven selects topographical analyst Lieutenant Jordan O&#x27;Neil, because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates.

To make the grade, O&#x27;Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost sixty percent of candidates wash out, most before the fourth week, with the third week being particularly intensive (&quot;hell week&quot;). The enigmatic Command Master Chief John James Urgayle runs the training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits&#x27; physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship fenders up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts. Even though O’Neil outranks Urgayle, he is in charge of training and O’Neil has to fight for her spot like all the others.

Given a 30-second &quot;gender-norming&quot; allowance in an obstacle course, O&#x27;Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. The master chief observes O&#x27;Neil helping the other candidates by allowing them to climb on her back to make it over the wall obstacle course. Eight weeks into the program, during SERE training in Captiva, Florida, the Master Chief ties her to a chair with her hands behind her back, grabs hold of her and slams her through the door, then picking her up off the floor he repeatedly dunks her head in ice-cold water in front of the other crew members. O&#x27;Neil retaliates and is successful in causing him some injury, despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees.

Navy leaders, confident that a woman would quickly drop out, become concerned. The media learn of O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s involvement, and she becomes a sensation known as &quot;G.I. Jane.&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. Soon, she must contend with trumped-up charges that she is a lesbian, and is fraternizing with women. O&#x27;Neil is told that she will be given a desk job during the investigation and, if cleared, will need to repeat her training from the beginning. She decides to &quot;ring out&quot; (ringing a bell three times, signaling her voluntary withdrawal from the program) rather than accept a desk job.

It is later revealed that the photo evidence of O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s alleged fraternization came from Senator DeHaven&#x27;s office. DeHaven never intended for O&#x27;Neil to succeed; she used O&#x27;Neil as a bargaining chip to prevent military base closings in her home state of Texas. O&#x27;Neil threatens to expose DeHaven, who then has the charges voided and O&#x27;Neil restored to the program.

The final phase of training, an operational readiness exercise, is interrupted by an emergency that requires the CRT trainees&#x27; support. The situation involves a reconnaissance satellite powered by weapons-grade plutonium that fell into the Libyan desert. A team of U.S. Army Rangers is dispatched to retrieve the plutonium, but their evacuation plan fails, and the trainees are sent to assist the Rangers. The Master Chief&#x27;s shooting of a Libyan soldier to protect O&#x27;Neil leads to a confrontation with a Libyan patrol. During the mission, O&#x27;Neil, using her experience as a topographical analyst, realizes when she sees the team&#x27;s map that the Master Chief is not going to use the route the others believe he will in regrouping with the others. She also displays a definitive ability in leadership and strategy while rescuing the injured Master Chief, whom she and McCool pull out of an explosives-laden &quot;kill zone.&quot; With helicopter gunships delivering the final assault to the defenders, the rescue mission is a success.

Upon their return, all those who participated in the mission are accepted to the CRT. Urgayle gives O&#x27;Neil his Navy Cross and a book of poetry containing a short poem, &quot;Self-pity&quot;, by D. H. Lawrence, as acknowledgment of her accomplishment and in gratitude for rescuing him.

==Release==

Release of &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; had been delayed by a week by Buena Vista Pictures and the film opened up against the comedy &quot;Money Talks&quot; from New Line Cinema. Both studios predicted their film would earn $11.1 million and be number 1 at the box office.
Buena Vista held sneak previews to generate positive word of mouth for the film. Phil Barlow, president of distribution for Buena Vista, said: &quot;We knew from the research that people loved the movie&quot;. He further said: &quot;All we had to do was get them in.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; attributed audience reticence to the declining popularity of actress Demi Moore.

In its second weekend, the film stayed at number one, grossing $10.1 million. In the end the film played in a widest release of 2,043 theaters and grossed $48.1 million domestically, falling slightly short of its $50 million production budget. The film managed to break even with the worldwide box office gross, totalling almost $99 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; has an approval rating of 53% based on reviews from 38 critics, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus was: &quot;Demi Moore admirably does her duty, but &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;″s well-intentioned message is obscured by stylistic bombast and an overload of jingoism.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;A very entertaining get-tough fantasy with political and feminist underpinnings.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The training sequences are as they have to be: incredible rigors, survived by O&#x27;Neil. They are good cinema because Ridley Scott, the director, brings a documentary attention to them, and because Demi Moore, having bitten off a great deal here, proves she can chew it.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Were women put on earth to be warriors? Demi Moore certainly was. The role of Jordan fits her as snugly as a new layer of muscle.&quot;

Deborah Brown of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;In spite of a catalogue of downsides, including clunky dialogue, fuzzy morals and preposterous story lines, G.I. Jane does offer a perverse level of enjoyment.&quot;

About Demi Moore’s performance, &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; screenwriter, David Twohy, tells Yahoo Entertainment: &quot;It&#x27;s the performance of her career. The movie rises or falls on her performance, and that required her to have a total, unflinching commitment to that part. And she had that commitment — I think she f***ing nailed it.&quot; About the critical and box-office’s reception, Twohy added: &quot;&quot;Striptease&quot; came out while we were in production, and the stink was in the air. I don&#x27;t think it was fairly received, and &quot;Striptease&quot; had a lot to do with it, because it was a truly bad movie. She should have been nominated for &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;, and I think she would have been, too, if not for &quot;Striptease&quot;. That tainted her chances and maybe everyone&#x27;s chances.&quot;

Looking back to the film, Demi Moore said: &quot;I loved working with Ridley Scott on &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;. Probably one of my favorite experiences.&quot; She added: &quot;Being of the generation I&#x27;m from, I really wanted to find an action-oriented film, and I felt like the response I got was polite, but like I was crazy.&quot;

===Accolades===
Demi Moore won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the film. Viggo Mortensen was nominated for Worst Fake Accent at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards but lost to Jon Voight for &quot;Anaconda&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;G.I. Jane&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on April 22, 1998. The only extra feature was a theatrical trailer. It was released on Blu-ray on April 3, 2007, with no extra features aside from trailers for other movies. The film was also released on LaserDisc; this release featured an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott. The film grossed $22,122,300 in rentals.

<text>Ahmed Vefik Pasha () (3 July 1823 2 April 1891) was an Ottoman statesman, diplomat, scholar, playwright, and translator during the Tanzimat and First Constitutional Era periods. He was commissioned with top-rank governmental duties, including presiding over the first Ottoman Parliament in 1877. He also served as Prime Minister for two brief periods. He also established the first Ottoman theatre and initiated the first Western style theatre plays in Bursa and translated Molière&#x27;s major works. His portrait was depicted on the Turkish postcard stamp dated 1966.

==Biography==
Ahmed Vefik Pasha was born of Greek extraction, his ancestors having previously converted to Islam, like many other Greek Muslims particularly from Crete (Cretan Turks) and Southern Macedonia in what is now northwestern Republic of Greece (see Vallahades). He started his education in 1831 in Constantinople and later went to Paris with his family, where he graduated from Saint Louis College.

In 1844 Ahmed Vefik was appointed to review claims of special exemptions from the &quot;jizya&quot; tax. Under some agreements, European officials had started to extend their extraterritorial privileges to &quot;proteges&quot; - Ottoman Christians of Maltese and Ionian origins. Concerned with the massive revenue loss from unpaid &quot;jizya&quot; taxes in İzmir Province, where around two thirds of the tax had become uncollectable, Ahmed Vefik was chosen to assess over 1,500 claims of British protection. 

Ahmed Vefik was twice made the Minister of Education of the Ottoman Empire. Though he was twice appointed Head of Government, he was appointed with the title &quot;Prime Minister&quot; instead of &quot;Grand Vizier&quot;. He built a theatre in Bursa when he was made the governor of the city. In 1860, he became the Ottoman ambassador to France. He wrote the first Turkish dictionary and is considered to be among the first Pan-Turkists.

<doc id="706811" wikidata="Q1137945" url="?curid=706811" title="Andalusi Arabic">
<text>Andalusi Arabic or Andalusian Arabic () was a variety or varieties of Arabic spoken mainly from the 8th to the 15th century in Al-Andalus, the regions of the Iberian Peninsula under the Muslim rule.

Arabic spread gradually over the centuries of Muslim rule in Iberia, primarily through conversion to Islam, although it was also learned and spoken by Christians and Jews. Arabic became the language of administration and was the primary language of literature produced in al-Andalus; the Andalusi vernacular was distinct among medieval Arabic vernaculars in that it was used in poetry, in &quot;zajal&quot; and the &quot;kharjas&quot; of &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot;. 

Arabic in al-Andalus existed largely in a situation of bilingualism with Andalusi Romance (known popularly as &quot;Mozarabic&quot;) until the 13th century. Arabic in Iberia was also characterized by diglossia: in addition to standard written Arabic, spoken varieties could be subdivided into an urban, educated idiolect and a register of the less-privileged masses.

After the fall of Granada in 1492, the Catholic rulers suppressed the use of Arabic, persecuting its speakers, passing policies against its use (such as the , which led directly to the Rebellion of the Alpujarras), and expelling the Moriscos in the early 17th century, after which Arabic became an extinct language in Iberia. It continued to be spoken to some degree in North Africa after the expulsion, influencing the speech of those communities, although Andalusi speakers rapidly assimilated into the Maghrebi communities to which they fled.

Spoken Andalusi Arabic had distinct features. It is unique among colloquial dialects in retaining from Standard Arabic the internal passive voice through vocalization. Through contact with Romance, spoken Andalusi Arabic adopted the phonemes and . Like the other Iberian languages, Andalusi lacked vowel length but had stress instead (e.g. &quot;Andalusí&quot; in place of &quot;Andalusī&quot;). A feature shared with Maghrebi Arabic was that the first-person imperfect was marked with the prefix &quot;n-&quot; ( &quot;nalʿab&quot; &#x27;I play&#x27;) like the plural in Standard Arabic, necessitating an analogical imperfect first-person plural, constructed with the suffix &quot;-ū&quot; ( &quot;nalʿabū&quot; &#x27;we play&#x27;). A feature characteristic of it was the extensive imala that transformed alif into an /e/ or /i/ (e.g. &quot;al-kirā&quot; (&quot;rent&quot;) &gt; &quot;al-kirē&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;alquiler&quot;). 

==History==

=== Origins ===
The Muslim conquest of Spain in 711, about a century after the death of Muhammad, involved a few thousand Arab tribesmen and a much larger number of partially Arabicized Amazigh, many of whom spoke little or no Arabic. According to Consuelo López-Morillas, &quot;this population sowed the seeds of what was to grow into an indigenous Andalusi Arabic.&quot;

Unlike the Visigothic conquest of Hispania, through which Latin remained the dominant language, the Muslim conquest brought a language that was a &quot;vehicle for a higher culture, a literate and literary civilization.&quot;

=== Spread ===

Over the centuries, Arabic spread gradually in al-Andalus, primarily through conversion to Islam. While Alvarus of Cordoba lamented in the 9th century that Christians were no longer using Latin, Richard Bulliet estimates that only 50% of the population of al-Andalus had converted to Islam by the death of Abd al-Rahman III in 961, and 80% by 1100. By about 1260, Muslim territories in Iberia were reduced to the Emirate of Granada, in which more than 90% of the population had converted to Islam and Arabic-Romance bilingualism seems to have disappeared.
The colloquial Arabic of al-Andalus was prominent among the varieties of Arabic of its time in its use for literary purposes, especially in &quot;zajal&quot; poetry and proverbs and aphorisms.

=== Demise ===
After the Fall of Granada in 1492, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros oversaw the forced mass conversion of the population in the Spanish Inquisition and the burning of Andalusi manuscripts in Granada. In 1502, the Muslims of Granada were forced to choose between conversion and exile; those who converted became known as the Moriscos. In 1526, Charles V (Charles I of Spain)—issued an edict against &quot;heresy&quot; (e.g. Muslim practices by &quot;New Christians&quot;), including the use of Arabic, extending the restruction to Muslims throughout the rest of Spain, the Mudéjars. The Moriscos managed to get this suspended for forty years by the payment of a large sum (80,000 ducados). King Philip II of Spain&#x27;s &quot;&quot; finally banned the use of Arabic throughout Spain—forbidding Moriscos from the use of Arabic on all occasions, formal and informal, speaking and writing—leading directly to the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568–71). Still, Andalusi Arabic remained in use in certain areas of Spain (particularly the inner regions of Valencia and Aragon) until the final expulsion of the Moriscos at the beginning of the 17th century.

=== Legacy ===
Andalusi Arabic is still used in Andalusi classical music and has significantly influenced the dialects of such towns as Sfax in Tunisia, Rabat, Salé, Fès, Tétouan and Tangier in Morocco, Nedroma, Tlemcen, Blida, Jijel, and Cherchell in Algeria, and Alexandria in Egypt. Andalusi Arabic also influenced Andalusi Romance (&quot;Mozarabic&quot;), Spanish, Judaeo-Spanish varieties, Catalan-Valencian-Balearic, Portuguese, Classical Arabic and Moroccan, Tunisian, Egyptian, Hassani and Algerian Arabics.

==Sociolinguistic features ==

=== Prestige ===
Under Muslim rule, Arabic became a superstrate, prestige language and the dominant medium of literary and intellectual expression in the southern half of the peninsula from the 8th century to the 13th century. Consuelo Lopez-Morillas notes that poetic genres such as &quot;zajal&quot; and the popular literature of proverbs and aphorisms demonstrate that, among speakers of Andalusi Arabic, there was a &quot;consciousness of, and even pride in, the distinctiveness of the dialect, its suppleness and expressivity.&quot;

=== Multilingualism and language contact ===

==== Romance ====
Arabic in al-Andalus existed largely in a situation of bilingualism with Romance until the 13th century, when the Almohad expansion into Iberia led to the flight of Christians living under Muslim in the south of Iberia northward to territories under Christian rule and to the reduction of territory under Muslim rule to the Emirate of Granada following a sequence of Christian conquests of Muslim cities. 

Of the approximately 600 known secular Arabic &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot;, there about 50 with &quot;kharjas&quot; in Andalusi Romance or containing some Romance words or elements.

The influence of Romance on Andalusi Arabic was especially pronounced in situations of daily Arabic-Romance contact. For example, an Arabic letter written by a Valencian Morisco in 1595 contained constructions such as (&#x27;do what is possible,&#x27; constructed with the Arabic verb &#x27;you do,&#x27; the Arabic definitive article &#x27;the&#x27; and the Romance cognate of English &#x27;possible&#x27;) and (&#x27;at a cost to me,&#x27; with the Romance &#x27;at a cost&#x27; and the Arabic personal possessive &#x27;my&#x27;).

The influence of Arabic on Spanish resulting from this linguistic contact has been thoroughly studied, but Romance also reciprocally influenced Andalusi Arabic. Dialectical features of Andalusi Arabic owing to Arabic-Romance bilingualism and contact include of the adoption of the phonemes and ; the substitution of the traditional Arabic vowel length for the Iberian syllabic stress (e.g. &quot;Andalusí&quot; in place of &quot;Andalusī&quot;); and the change of gender of some nouns to corresponding the gender in Romance, such as the feminine Arabic nouns &quot;ʿayn&quot; ( &#x27;eye&#x27;) and &quot;shams&quot; ( &#x27;sun&#x27;), which became masculine in al-Andalus, matching &quot;ojo&quot; and &quot;sol&quot;. 

==== Hebrew ====
Arabic also coexisted with Hebrew, and Arabic features and traditions had a major impact on Jewish poetry in Iberia. There is evidence that code-switching was commonplace among bilingual populations in al-Andalus. About half of the corpus of the more than 250 known &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; in Hebrew have &quot;kharjas&quot; in Arabic, and some there are some &quot;kharjas&quot; with a mix of Arabic and Hebrew.
It also had some contact with Berber languages or ( &#x27;the western tongue&#x27;) in periods of Berber rule, particularly under the Almoravids and Almohads, though Federico Corriente identified only about 15 Berberisms that entered Andalusi Arabic speech.

=== Diglossia ===
It was also characterized by diglossia: in addition to standard written Arabic, spoken varieties could be subdivided into an urban, educated idiolect and a register of the less-privileged masses.

==Linguistic features ==
Many features of Andalusi Arabic have been reconstructed by Arabists using Hispano-Arabic texts (such as the &quot;azjāl&quot; of ibn Quzman, al-Shushtari and others) composed in Arabic with varying degrees of deviation from classical norms, augmented by further information from the manner in which the Arabic script was used to transliterate Romance words. The first complete linguistic description of Andalusi Arabic was given by the Spanish Arabist Federico Corriente, who drew on the &quot;Appendix Probi&quot;, &quot;zajal&quot; poetry, proverbs and aphorisms, the work of the 16th century lexicographer Pedro de Alcalá, and Andalusi letters found in the Cairo Geniza.

=== Lexicography ===

==== Romance loanwords ====
As Arabisms moved into varieties of Iberian Romance over time, Andalusi Arabic borrowed widely from the Romance lexicon. Corriente observes three periods in which Romance words entered Arabic, as Romance shifted from a substratum to an adstratum to a superstratum with respect to Arabic. Semantic fields such as plant and animal names, domestic objects, and agriculture received the most loanwords. Sometimes both the Romance and Arabic words were used, such as the words (from ) and () for navel; Consuelo Lopez-Morillas recalls &quot;the many households made up of Hispano-Roman women and Arab men.&quot; Once subsumed into Arabic morphological patterns, Romance loanwords became difficult to distinguish as such. For example, (from &#x27;anniversary&#x27; or &#x27;birthday&#x27;) was made plural as and (from &#x27;wolf&#x27;) became a broken plural as . Romance loanwords were used in Andalusi Arabic through the end of Muslim rule in Iberia, even after Granada had been monolingually arabophone for two centuries.

==== Berber loanwords ====
The lexical impact of Berber language on Andalusi Arabic appears to be considerably less than that of Romance and very small in proportion to the extensive Berber presence in al-Andalus. Corriente identified about 15 Berberisms that entered Andalusi Arabic, only a few of which were still in use in the early 16th century.

===Phonology ===

The phoneme represented by the letter ق in texts is a point of contention. The letter, which in Classical Arabic represented either a voiceless pharyngealized velar stop or a voiceless uvular stop, most likely represented some kind of post-alveolar affricate or velar plosive in Andalusi Arabic. Federico Corriente presents the case that ق most often represented , sometimes , and marginally based on a plethora of surviving Andalusi writings and Romance transcriptions of Andalusi Arabic words.

The vowel system was subject to a heavy amount of fronting and raising, a phenomenon known as &quot;imāla&quot;, causing to be raised, probably to or and, particularly with short vowels, in certain circumstances, particularly when i-mutation was possible.

Contact with native Romance speakers led to the introduction of the phonemes , and, possibly, the affricate from loanwords.

Monophthongization led to the disappearance of certain diphthongs such as and which were leveled to and , respectively, though Colin hypothesizes that these diphthongs remained in the more mesolectal registers influenced by the Classical language. Alternatively in higher registers, and were only allophones of and respectively, while diphthongs were mostly resistant to monophthongization. However, could turn into or via &quot;imāla&quot;. In the presence of velar or pharyngeal contour, was backed into and sometimes even rounded into or , or even . This is evidenced by occasional Romance or even local Arabic transcription of as or .

There was a fair amount of compensatory lengthening involved where a loss of consonantal gemination lengthened the preceding vowel, whence the transformation of (&quot;nest&quot;) into .

New phonemes introduced into Andalusi Arabic, such as and were often written as geminated and respectively. This would later be carried over into Aljamiado, in which and in Romance languages would be transcribed with the above letters, each containing a shadda.

===Syntax ===

==== Passive voice ====
Andalusi Arabic is uniquely conservative among colloquial Arabic dialects for retaining the internal passive voice ( ) of Standard Arabic verbs, using the same stem of the active voice verb with different vocalization. The passive voice is expressed in the past or perfect tense with kasra (/i/) on the last syllable and damma (/u/) on all other syllables, and in the imperfect tense with damma /u/ on the personal subject prefix—the first syllable—and fatḥah /a/ on the following syllables.
==== Noun gender ====
Some nouns in Andalusi Arabic shifted gender to match the gender of corresponding terms in Romance, such as the feminine Arabic nouns &quot;ʿayn&quot; ( &#x27;eye&#x27;) and &quot;shams&quot; ( &#x27;sun&#x27;), which became masculine in al-Andalus, matching &quot;ojo&quot; and &quot;sol&quot;.

=== Morphology ===
Gender distinction in second-person pronouns and verbs was abandoned.

There were about twenty suffixes from Romance that were attached to Arabic bases.
The &#x27; which, in Classical Arabic, marked a noun as indefinite accusative case (see nunation), became an indeclinable conjunctive particle, as in ibn Quzmān&#x27;s expression &#x27;.

The unconjugated prepositive negative particle &#x27; developed out of the classical verb &#x27;.

The derivational morphology of the verbal system was substantially altered. One example is the initial &quot;n-&quot; on verbs in the first person singular, a feature shared by many Maghrebi varieties. Likewise the form V pattern of &#x27; () was altered by epenthesis to &#x27; ().

Andalusi Arabic developed a contingent/subjunctive mood (after a protasis with the conditional particle &#x27;) consisting of the imperfect (prefix) form of a verb, preceded by either &#x27; or &#x27; (depending on the register of the speech in question), of which the final &#x27; was normally assimilated by preformatives &#x27; and &#x27;. An example drawn from Ibn Quzmān will illustrate this:


== Recorded evidence ==
The oldest evidence of Andalusi Arabic utterances can be dated from the 10th and 11th century, in isolated quotes, both in prose and stanzaic Classical Andalusi poems (&quot;muwashshahat&quot;), and then, from the 11th century on, in stanzaic dialectal poems (&quot;zajal&quot;) and dialectal proverb collections.

Substantial material on late Granadan Arabic survives in the work of Pedro de Alcalá—the &quot;Vocabulista aravigo en letra castellana&quot; and &quot;Arte para ligeramente saber la lengua araviga&quot;, both published in 1505 to explain the language of the conquered to the conquerors following the Fall of Granada.

Its last documents are a few business records and one letter written at the beginning of the 17th century in Valencia.

<text>Fumoto no iro (麓の色 &quot;Sex in the Foothills&quot;) is a novel and treatise on homosexual behavior (nanshoku (男色)) published in Japan in 1768 that tells the story of a sixty-year-old gigolo named Ogiya Yashige. Though fictional, Yashige is considered a precursor to modern Japanese notions of sexual morality, which dictates that (gay) male prostitutes are already past their prime at seventeen years of age. Pubescent boys were anal penetrators; pre-pubescent boys were to be penetrated.

<text>Andrea Lynn Horwath (; born October 24, 1962) is a Canadian politician who has served as the 58th mayor of Hamilton since 2022. Horwath served as the leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2009 to 2022 and as the leader of the Official Opposition from 2018 to 2022.

Horwath was first elected in 1997, when she won a seat on Hamilton City Council. In 2004, she was elected as the member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Hamilton Centre, a seat she would hold until 2022. Horwath was elected as the leader Ontario NDP at the party&#x27;s 2009 leadership convention, and led the party through four provincial elections, before resigning in 2022. She is the first woman to lead the NDP, and the third woman (after Lyn McLeod and Kathleen Wynne) to serve as leader of a party with official party status in Ontario.

During the 2018 provincial election, Horwath led the Ontario NDP to official opposition status after 23 years without government or official opposition status. The results of the 2022 provincial election, after which the Ontario NDP remained the official opposition, led to Horwath announcing her intention to resign as the leader of the Ontario NDP on the night of June 2, 2022. Her resignation took effect on June 28, 2022.

On July 26, 2022, Horwath announced her candidacy for mayor of Hamilton, and resigned her seat in the provincial legislature on August 15, 2022. She was elected mayor on October 24, 2022, and was sworn in on November 15.

== Early life, education and early career ==
Andrea Lynn Horwath was born and raised in Stoney Creek. She is named after her father Andrew, an ethnic Hungarian who had immigrated to Canada from Slovakia, and worked on the assembly line at the Ford Motor Company plant in Oakville, Ontario. Her mother, Diane, is of French and Irish descent.

Horwath has a Bachelor of Arts degree from McMaster University. While her initial program was in human resources, she was drawn to labour studies. She worked part-time as a waitress to pay her way through university. After graduating, Horwath worked in literacy training, legal-aid advocacy, and &quot;community organization&quot;.

==Early political career==
In the Canadian federal election of 1997, she was the NDP candidate against incumbent Liberal Stan Keyes in the riding of Hamilton West. Although unsuccessful, her second-place finish was a significant improvement on previous NDP efforts in the riding, and gave her an increased level of prominence in the city.

===City councillor===
Later in 1997, she was elected to Hamilton City Council for Ward Two, outpolling two incumbents who had represented the area for more than 20 years. She emerged as a prominent voice for the political left in the city, and was re-elected to council in 2000 and 2003. During her three terms as city councillor, she chaired the solid-waste-management committee and the municipal non-profit housing corporation.

==Provincial politics==
Horwath was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in a 2004 by-election in the then-extant provincial riding of Hamilton East, defeating Liberal candidate Ralph Agostino to succeed the deceased Liberal member Dominic Agostino, Ralph&#x27;s brother. Winning 63.6 per cent of the vote, up from the NDP&#x27;s 29.4 per cent in that riding six months earlier, her landslide victory boosted the NDP&#x27;s seat count over the threshold for official party status in the legislature, and helped give the federal New Democratic Party a bounce in Hamilton that would continue into the federal election shortly thereafter.

In the 2007 election, Horwath ran in the new riding of Hamilton Centre, due to redistricting that divided her former Hamilton East riding between Hamilton Centre and the new riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek. Horwath&#x27;s new Hamilton Centre riding included approximately half of her former riding as well as a portion of the former Hamilton West riding where she had run federally in 1997. It also included her entire former city council ward.

In the lead up to the campaign, Horwath was expected to face Hamilton West Liberal incumbent Judy Marsales. However, Marsales opted not to run for another term, and Horwath easily defeated Liberal candidate Steve Ruddick on election day.

===Leader of the Ontario NDP===
====2009 leadership election====
On November 7, 2008, Horwath officially launched her campaign to win the party&#x27;s leadership. The leadership election was held March 6–8, 2009. Horwath led on the first two ballots, and won on the third ballot with 60.4% of the vote defeating Peter Tabuns, Gilles Bisson and Michael Prue.

====2011 election====

The 2011 provincial election saw a rise in support for the NDP under Horwath&#x27;s leadership. The party won more than 20% of the popular vote for the first time since 1995 and almost doubled its seats to elect 17 members of the legislature. The election also resulted in the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty being reduced to a minority government with the NDP holding the balance of power.

In April 2012, Horwath passed a leadership review at the party&#x27;s convention with 76% support.

====2014 election====
On May 4, Horwath announced that the NDP would be voting against the Liberals&#x27; proposed budget, triggering a spring election. Following this, Premier Kathleen Wynne formally asked Lieutenant Governor David Onley to dissolve the legislature and call an election for June 12, 2014. In the 2014 provincial election, the NDP was able to maintain its seat count of 21 at dissolution despite the loss of three seats in Toronto, but lost the balance of power when the Liberals took a majority win in the election. Horwath has faced criticism from some party members and progressives for running a populist campaign which they described as right-wing. Despite criticism of her leadership from some quarters, Horwath received a slightly increased level of support, 77%, at the party&#x27;s post-election convention held on November 15.

====2018 election====

Horwath ran in her third election as NDP leader against the Liberal government led by Kathleen Wynne and a Progressive Conservative Party led by Doug Ford. Horwath promised to introduce &quot;Canada&#x27;s first universal Pharmacare plan&quot;, highlighted by a universal dental plan and a prescription drug plan that &quot;will initially cover 125 of the most commonly prescribed drugs&quot;. She also promised a child care plan in which seventy per cent of Ontario parents &quot;would either have free child care or pay an average of $12 a day in a licensed not-for-profit daycare&quot;. Horwath promised to return Hydro One to public ownership by buying back privately held shares. She also said that she would close the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station immediately, while the other party leaders have pledged to keep it open until 2024. The NDP promised to increase corporate tax rates from 11.5 to 12.5 per cent, as well as introducing an income tax increase for those earning over $220,000 per year. Horwath said the province would fund half of the operating cost of municipal transit and indicated that she would not introduce back-to-work legislation. The party&#x27;s support in public opinion polls increased in May 2018, leading to greater media attention and greater scrutiny. With her party gaining official opposition status, she became the Leader of the Official Opposition during the 42nd Parliament, the second highest number of seats in the party&#x27;s history. The NDP took all of old Toronto (i.e., what was the city of Toronto before the 1998 creation of the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto), as well as all but one seat in Hamilton and all but one seat in Niagara.

====2022 election====

Horwath and the NDP released their 2022 platform in April 2022. The NDP&#x27;s campaign focused on increased funding for social programs and government services, which would be paid for through higher taxes on businesses and individuals earning over $200,000 per year. Funding would go toward reducing class sizes, raising welfare payments and disability payments, subsidies for black, indigenous and LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs, hiring more healthcare and education staff and increased wages for public servants. The NDP also proposed to expand COVID-19 vaccine mandates, implement a mixed member proportional electoral system, to close down all privately owned long-term care facilities and to stop the construction of new highway projects. Horwath was re-elected in Hamilton Centre and the NDP won opposition, but it lost 9 seats and placed third in the popular vote. Horwath resigned as leader election night. The election set a record for the lowest voter turnout in an Ontario provincial election, as only 44.06% of the people who were eligible voted. On August 15, 2022, she resigned as the MPP for Hamilton Centre.

==Mayor of Hamilton==

Horwath ran as a candidate for the position of Mayor of Hamilton, Ontario in the October 2022 Hamilton, Ontario municipal election. She was elected on October 24, 2022. Horwath is the first woman to be elected mayor in Hamilton&#x27;s history. Prior to amalgamation, the suburban communities of Stoney Creek and Ancaster had women mayors and former Hamilton Controller, Anne Jones, served as the first regional chair for the Region of Hamilton-Wentworth was also a woman.

===Tenure===
Horwath took office as mayor on November 15, 2022. She is one of the highest paid mayors in Canada, earning over $270,000 in 2023.

In September 2024, she moved to make National Day of Truth and Reconciliation a municipal holiday.

====City finances====
In the 2023 budget, city council approved a 5.8% property tax increase, with the housing budget increasing by 30%. Similarly, the 2024 budget increased property taxes by 5.79%.

====Housing====
In April 2023, Hamilton city council declared a state of emergency over opioids, homelessness, and mental health.

In April 2024, following city council&#x27;s rejection of the plan, Horwath used her strong mayor powers to pass a plan to build affordable housing on a Stoney Creek parking lot. Hamilton’s ethics watchdog later cleared Horwath of wrongdoing in response to a complaint over her role in advancing the plan. The provincial government had previously rewarded Hamilton with $17.5 million for exceeding 2023 housing targets.

In August 2024, she endorsed a previously proposed plan on sanctioned encampments offering tiny homes to unhoused people. The city later banned tents in public parks, and was sued by 14 unhoused residents, citing alleged infringed charter rights. The Ontario Superior Court later ruled in the city&#x27;s favour in December 2024. The city also approved a plan to build an outdoor shelter on Barton Street, constructed in December 2024.

==Personal life==
She lives in Hamilton with her son Julian (born November 1992), who is a rapper. In a March 2011 interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, she spoke publicly for the first time about the breakup of her longtime relationship with Julian&#x27;s father, Hamilton businessman Ben Leonetti. Horwath had met Ben Leonetti in her university years, when she was working part-time as a waitress and he was a jazz musician. The two lived together for 25 years without getting married and split up in 2010.

==Awards==
In March 2012, Horwath received the EVE award which is sponsored by Equal Voice, a non-profit organization focused on promoting women in politics. Past recipients have included women from every level of government.

<text>Egyptian Arabic, locally known as Colloquial Egyptian ( ), or simply Masri (also Masry, ) (), is the most widely spoken vernacular Arabic variety in Egypt. It is part of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and originated in the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt. The estimated 100 million Egyptians speak a continuum of dialects, among which Cairene is the most prominent. It is also understood across most of the Arabic-speaking countries due to broad Egyptian influence in the region, including through Egyptian cinema and Egyptian music. These factors help to make it the most widely spoken and by far the most widely studied variety of Arabic.

While it is primarily a spoken language, the written form is used in novels, plays and poems (vernacular literature), as well as in comics, advertising, some newspapers and transcriptions of popular songs. In most other written media and in radio and television news reporting, literary Arabic is used. Literary Arabic is a standardized language based on the language of the Qur&#x27;an, i.e. Classical Arabic. The Egyptian vernacular is almost universally written in the Arabic alphabet for local consumption, although it is commonly transcribed into Latin letters or in the International Phonetic Alphabet in linguistics text and textbooks aimed at teaching non-native learners. Egyptian Arabic&#x27;s phonetics, grammatical structure, and vocabulary are influenced by the Coptic language; its rich vocabulary is also influenced by Turkish and by European languages such as French, Italian, Greek, and English.

== Naming ==
Speakers of Egyptian Arabic generally call their vernacular &#x27;Arabic&#x27; (, ) when juxtaposed with non-Arabic languages; &quot;Colloquial Egyptian&quot; (, ) or simply &quot;Aamiyya&quot; (, &quot;colloquial&quot;) when juxtaposed with Modern Standard Arabic and the Egyptian dialect (, ) or simply Masri (, , &quot;Egyptian&quot;) when juxtaposed with other vernacular Arabic dialects.

The term &quot;Egyptian Arabic&quot; is usually used synonymously with &quot;Cairene Arabic&quot;, which is technically a dialect of Egyptian Arabic. The country&#x27;s native name, , is often used locally to refer to Cairo itself. As is the case with Parisian French, Cairene Arabic is by far the most prevalent dialect in the country.

== Geographic distribution ==
Egyptian Arabic has become widely understood in the Arabic-speaking world primarily for two reasons: The proliferation and popularity of Egyptian films and other media in the region since the early 20th century as well as the great number of Egyptian teachers and professors who were instrumental in setting up the education systems of various countries in the Arabian Peninsula and also taught there and in other countries such as Algeria and Libya. Also, many Lebanese artists choose to sing in Egyptian.

== History ==

Arabic was spoken in parts of Egypt such as the Eastern Desert and Sinai before Islam. However, Nile Valley Egyptians slowly adopted Arabic as a written language following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the seventh century. Until then, they had spoken either Koine Greek or Egyptian in its Coptic form. A period of Coptic-Arabic bilingualism in Lower Egypt lasted for more than three centuries. The period would last much longer in the south. Arabic had been already familiar to Valley Egyptians since Arabic had been spoken throughout the Eastern Desert and Sinai. Arabic was also a minority language of some residents of the Nile Valley such as Qift in Upper Egypt through pre-Islamic trade with Nabateans in the Sinai Peninsula and the easternmost part of the Nile Delta. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in Fustat, the first Islamic capital of Egypt, now part of Cairo.

One of the earliest linguistic sketches of Cairene Arabic is a 16th-century document entitled &quot;&quot;(, &quot;The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Cairo&quot;) by the traveler and lexicographer Yusuf al-Maghribi (), with &quot;Misr&quot; here meaning &quot;Cairo&quot;. It contains key information on early Cairene Arabic and the language situation in Egypt in the Middle Ages. The main purpose of the document was to show that while the Cairenes&#x27; vernacular contained many critical &quot;errors&quot; vis-à-vis Classical Arabic, according to al-Maghribi, it was also related to Arabic in other respects. With few waves of immigration from the Arabian peninsula such as the Banu Hilal exodus, who later left Egypt and were settled in Morocco and Tunisia, together with the ongoing Islamization and Arabization of the country, multiple Arabic varieties, one of which is Egyptian Arabic, slowly supplanted spoken Coptic. Local chroniclers mention the continued use of Coptic as a spoken language until the 17th century by peasant women in Upper Egypt. Coptic is still the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Coptic Catholic Church.

Ahmed Kamal Pasha (1851-1923), the author of Egypt’s first Ancient Egyptian Dictionary, referred to the fact that more than 12000 word from the Modern Egyptian Arabic dialect is rooted in Ancient Egyptian language.

== Status ==
Egyptian Arabic has no official status and is not officially recognized as a language. Standard Arabic is the official language of the state as per constitutional law with the name , lit. &quot;the Arabic language&quot;. Interest in the local vernacular began in the 1800s (in opposition to the language of the ruling class, Turkish) , as the Egyptian national movement for self-determination was taking shape. For many decades to follow, questions about the reform and the modernization of Arabic were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing neologisms to replace archaic terminology in Modern Standard Arabic to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules and the introduction of colloquialisms to even complete &quot;Egyptianization&quot; (, ) by abandoning the so-called Modern Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.

Proponents of language reform in Egypt included Qasim Amin, who also wrote the first Egyptian feminist treatise, former President of the Egyptian University, Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, and noted intellectual Salama Moussa. They adopted a modernist, secular approach and disagreed with the assumption that Arabic was an immutable language because of its association with the Qur&#x27;an. The first modern Egyptian novel in which the dialogue was written in the vernacular was Muhammad Husayn Haykal&#x27;s &quot;Zaynab&quot; in 1913. It was only in 1966 that Mustafa Musharafa&#x27;s &quot;Kantara Who Disbelieved&quot; was released, the first novel to be written entirely in Egyptian Arabic. Other notable novelists, such as Ihsan Abdel Quddous and Yusuf Idris, and poets, such as Salah Jahin, Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi and Ahmed Fouad Negm, helped solidify vernacular literature as a distinct literary genre.

Amongst certain groups within Egypt&#x27;s elite, Egyptian Arabic enjoyed a brief period of rich literary output. That dwindled with the rise of Pan-Arabism, which had gained popularity in Egypt by the second half of the twentieth century, as demonstrated by Egypt&#x27;s involvement in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War under King Farouk of Egypt. The Egyptian revolution of 1952, led by Mohammed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, further enhanced the significance of Pan-Arabism, making it a central element of Egyptian state policy. The importance of Modern Standard Arabic was reemphasised in the public sphere by the revolutionary government, and efforts to accord any formal language status to the Egyptian vernacular were ignored. Egyptian Arabic was identified as a mere dialect, one that was not spoken even in all of Egypt, as almost all of Upper Egypt speaks Sa&#x27;idi Arabic. Though the revolutionary government heavily sponsored the use of the Egyptian vernacular in films, plays, television programmes, and music, the prerevolutionary use of Modern Standard Arabic in official publications was retained.

Linguistic commentators have noted the multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt&#x27;s first president, Mohammed Naguib exhibited a preference for using Modern Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor, Gamal Abdel Nasser was renowned for using the vernacular and for punctuating his speeches with traditional Egyptian words and expressions. Conversely, Modern Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. That was especially true of Egypt&#x27;s national broadcasting company, the Arab Radio and Television Union, which was established with the intent of providing content for the entire Arab world, not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard, rather than the vernacular, language. The Voice of the Arabs radio station, in particular, had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Modern Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.

In a study of three Egyptian newspapers (Al-Ahram, Al-Masry Al-Youm, and Al-Dustour) Zeinab Ibrahim concluded that the total number of headlines in Egyptian Arabic in each newspaper varied. Al-Ahram did not include any. Al-Masry Al-Youm had an average of 5% of headlines in Egyptian, while Al-Dustour averaged 11%.

As the status of Egyptian Arabic as opposed to Classical Arabic can have such political and religious implications in Egypt, the question of whether Egyptian Arabic should be considered a &quot;dialect&quot; or &quot;language&quot; can be a source of debate. In sociolinguistics, Egyptian Arabic can be seen as one of many distinct varieties that, despite arguably being languages on grounds, are united by a common in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

== Publications ==
During the early 1900s many portions of the Bible were published in Egyptian Arabic. These were published by the &quot;Nile Mission Press&quot;. By 1932 the whole New Testament and some books of the Old Testament had been published in Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script.

The dialogs in the following novels are partly in Egyptian Arabic, partly in Standard Arabic: Mahmud Tahir Haqqi&#x27;s &quot;Adhra&#x27; Dinshuway&quot; (; 1906), Yaqub Sarruf&#x27;s &quot;Fatat Misr&quot; (; first published in Al-Muqtataf 1905–1906), and Mohammed Hussein Heikal&#x27;s &quot;Zaynab&quot; (1914).

Early stage plays written in Egyptian Arabic were translated from or influenced by European playwrights. Muhammad &#x27;Uthman Jalal translated plays by Molière, Jean Racine and Carlo Goldoni to Egyptian Arabic and adapted them as well as ten fables by Jean de La Fontaine. Yaqub Sanu translated to and wrote plays on himself in Egyptian Arabic.
Many plays were written in Standard Arabic, but performed in colloquial Arabic. Tawfiq al-Hakim took this a step further and provided for his Standard Arabic plays versions in colloquial Arabic for the performances. Mahmud Taymur has published some of his plays in two versions, one in Standard, one in colloquial Arabic, among them: &quot;Kidb fi Kidb&quot; (, 1951 or ca. 1952) and &quot;Al-Muzayyifun&quot; (, ca. 1953).

The writers of stage plays in Egyptian Arabic after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 include No&#x27;man Ashour, Alfred Farag, , Rashad Roushdy, and Yusuf Idris. Thereafter the use of colloquial Egyptian Arabic in theater is stable and common. Later writers of plays in colloquial Egyptian include Ali Salem, and Naguib Surur.

Novels in Egyptian Arabic after the 1940s and before the 1990s are rare. There are by &quot;Qantarah Alladhi Kafar&quot; (, Cairo, 1965) and Uthman Sabri&#x27;s (; 1896–1986) &quot;Journey on the Nile&quot; (, 1965) (and his &quot;Bet Sirri&quot; (, 1981) that apparently uses a mix of Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic).

Prose published in Egyptian Arabic since the 1990s include the following novels:
Yusuf al-Qa&#x27;id&#x27;s &quot;Laban il-Asfur&quot; (; 1994),
Baha&#x27; Awwad&#x27;s () &quot;Shams il-Asil&quot; (; 1998),
Safa Abdel Al Moneim&#x27;s &quot;Min Halawit il-Ruh&quot; (, 1998),
Samih Faraj&#x27;s () &quot;Banhuf Ishtirasa&quot; (, 1999);
autobiographies include the one by Ahmed Fouad Negm,
by &quot;Ula Awwil&quot; (),
and Fathia al-Assal&#x27;s &quot;Hudn il-Umr&quot; ().

The epistolary novel &quot;Jawabat Haraji il-Gutt&quot; (, 2001) by Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi is exceptional in its use of Saʽidi Arabic.

21st-century journals publishing in Egyptian Arabic include &quot;Bārti&quot; (from at least 2002), the weekly magazine &quot;Idhak lil-Dunya&quot; (, from 2005), and the monthly magazine (, from 2005). In the 21st century the number of books published in Egyptian Arabic has increased a lot. Many of them are by female authors, for example &quot;I Want to Get Married!&quot; (, 2008) by Ghada Abdel Aal and &quot;She Must Have Travelled&quot; (, 2016) by Soha Elfeqy.

== Spoken varieties ==
Sa&#x27;īdi Arabic is a different variety than Egyptian Arabic in Ethnologue.com and ISO 639-3 and in other sources, and the two varieties have limited mutual intelligibility. It carries little prestige nationally but continues to be widely spoken, with 19,000,000 speakers.

The traditional division between Upper and Lower Egypt and their respective differences go back to ancient times. Egyptians today commonly call the people of the north () and those of the south (). The differences throughout Egypt, however, are more wide-ranging and do not neatly correspond to the simple division. The language shifts from the eastern to the western parts of the Nile Delta, and the varieties spoken from Giza to Minya are further grouped into a Middle Egypt cluster. Despite the differences, there are features distinguishing all the Egyptian Arabic varieties of the Nile Valley from any other varieties of Arabic. Such features include reduction of long vowels in open and unstressed syllables, the postposition of demonstratives and interrogatives, the modal meaning of the imperfect and the integration of the participle.

The Western Egyptian Bedawi Arabic variety of the western desert differs from all other Arabic varieties in Egypt in that it linguistically is part of Maghrebi Arabic. Northwest Arabian Arabic is also distinct from Egyptian Arabic.

=== Regional variations ===

Egyptian Arabic varies regionally across its sprachraum, with certain characteristics being noted as typical of the speech of certain regions.

==== Alexandria ====
The dialect of Alexandria (West Delta) is noted for certain shibboleths separating its speech from that of Cairo (South Delta). The ones that are most frequently noted in popular discourse are the use of the word &quot;falafel&quot; as opposed to for the fava-bean fritters common across the country and the pronunciation of the word for the Egyptian pound ( ), as , closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British guinea).
The speech of the older Alexandrians is also noted for use of the same pre-syllable (ne-) in the singular and plural of the first person present and future tenses, which is also a common feature of Tunisian Arabic and also of Maghrebi Arabic in general. The dialects of the western Delta tend to use the perfect with instead of the perfect with , for example for this is instead of . Other examples for this are , , , , رَجَع, طَلَع, رَكَب.

==== Port Said ====
Port Said&#x27;s dialect (East Delta) is noted for a &quot;heavier&quot;, more guttural sound, compared to other regions of the country.

==== Rural Nile Delta ====
The dialect of the Fellah in Northern Egypt is noted for a distinct accent, replacing the urban pronunciations of (spelled ) and ( ) with and respectively, but that is not true of all rural dialects, a lot of them do not have such replacement. The dialect also has many grammatical differences when contrasted to urban dialects.

== Phonology ==

Egyptian Arabic has a phonology that differs significantly from that of other varieties of Arabic, and has its own inventory of consonants and vowels.

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===
In contrast to CA and MSA, but like all modern colloquial varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic nouns are not inflected for case and lack nunation (with the exception of certain fixed phrases in the accusative case, such as , &quot;thank you&quot;). As all nouns take their pausal forms, singular words and broken plurals simply lose their case endings. In sound plurals and dual forms, where, in MSA, difference in case is present even in pausal forms, the genitive/accusative form is the one preserved. Fixed expressions in the construct state beginning in &quot;abu&quot;, often geographic names, retain their &quot;-u&quot; in all cases.

==== Plurals ====
Nouns take either a &quot;sound plural&quot; or &quot;broken plural&quot;. The sound plural is formed by adding endings, and can be considered part of the declension. For the broken plural, however, a different pattern for the stem is used.
The sound plural with the suffix is used for nouns referring to male persons that are participles or follow the pattern CaCCaaC. It takes the form for nouns of the form CaCCa and the form for &quot;nisba&quot; adjectives.

==== Color/defect nouns ====
A common set of nouns referring to colors, as well as a number of nouns referring to physical defects of various sorts (&quot;ʔaṣlaʕ&quot; &quot;bald&quot;; &quot;ʔaṭṛaʃ&quot; &quot;deaf&quot;; &quot;ʔaxṛas&quot; &quot;dumb&quot;), take a special inflectional pattern, as shown in the table. Only a small number of common colors inflect this way: &quot;ʔaḥmaṛ&quot; &quot;red&quot;; &quot;ʔazraʔ&quot; &quot;blue&quot;; &quot;ʔaxḍaṛ&quot; &quot;green&quot;; &quot;ʔaṣfaṛ&quot; &quot;yellow&quot;; &quot;ʔabyaḍ&quot; &quot;white&quot;; &quot;ʔiswid&quot; &quot;black&quot;; &quot;ʔasmaṛ&quot; &quot;brown-skinned, brunette&quot;; &quot;ʔaʃʔaṛ&quot; &quot;blond(e)&quot;. The remaining colors are invariable, and mostly so-called &quot;nisba&quot; adjectives derived from colored objects: &quot;bunni&quot; &quot;brown&quot; (&lt; &quot;bunn&quot; &quot;coffee powder&quot;); &quot;ṛamaadi&quot; &quot;gray&quot; (&lt; &quot;ṛamaad&quot; &quot;ashes&quot;); &quot;banafsigi&quot; &quot;purple&quot; (&lt; &quot;banafsig&quot; &quot;violet&quot;); &quot;burtuʔaani&quot; &quot;orange&quot; (&lt; &quot;burtuʔaan&quot; &quot;oranges&quot;); &quot;zibiibi&quot; &quot;maroon&quot; (&lt; &quot;zibiib&quot; &quot;raisins&quot;); etc., or of foreign origin: &quot;beeع&quot; &quot;beige&quot; from the French; &quot;bamba&quot; &quot;pink&quot; from Turkish &quot;&quot;.

==== Verbal nouns of form I ====
Verbal nouns of form I are not regular. The following table lists common patterns.

=== Pronouns ===


Egyptian Arabic object pronouns are clitics, in that they attach to the end of a noun, verb, or preposition, with the result forming a single phonological word rather than separate words. Clitics can be attached to the following types of words:
*A clitic pronoun attached to a noun indicates possession: &quot;béet&quot; &quot;house&quot;, &quot;béet-i&quot; &quot;my house&quot;; &quot;sikkíina&quot; &quot;knife&quot;, &quot;sikkínt-i&quot; &quot;my knife&quot;; &quot;ʔább&quot; &quot;father&quot;, &quot;ʔabúu-ya&quot; &quot;my father&quot;. The form of a pronoun may vary depending on the phonological form of the word being attached to (ending with a vowel or with one or two consonants), and the noun being attached to may also have a separate &quot;construct&quot; form before possessive clitic suffixes.
*A clitic pronoun attached to a preposition indicates the object of the preposition: &quot;minno&quot; &quot;from it (masculine object)&quot;, &quot;ʕaleyha&quot; &quot;on it (feminine object)&quot;
*A clitic pronoun attached to a verb indicates the object of the verb: &quot;ʃúft&quot; &quot;I saw&quot;, &quot;ʃúft-u&quot; &quot;I saw him&quot;, &quot;ʃuft-áha&quot; &quot;I saw her&quot;.

With verbs, indirect object clitic pronouns can be formed using the preposition &quot;li-&quot; plus a clitic. Both direct and indirect object clitic pronouns can be attached to a single verb: &quot;agíib&quot; &quot;I bring&quot;, &quot;agíb-hu&quot; &quot;I bring it&quot;, &quot;agib-húu-lik&quot; &quot;I bring it to you&quot;, &quot;m-agib-hu-lkíi-ʃ&quot; &quot;I do not bring it to you&quot;.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Arabic are based on a stem made up of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person, and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive.

Each particular lexical verb is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses along with subjunctive and imperative moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number, and gender, while to the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) Since Arabic lacks an infinitive, the third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the &quot;dictionary form&quot; used to identify a verb. For example, the verb meaning &quot;write&quot; is often specified as &quot;kátab&quot;, which actually means &quot;he wrote&quot;. In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as &quot;kátab/yíktib&quot; (where &quot;kátab&quot; means &quot;he wrote&quot; and &quot;yíktib&quot; means &quot;he writes&quot;), indicating the past stem (&quot;katab-&quot;) and non-past stem (&quot;-ktib-&quot;, obtained by removing the prefix &quot;yi-&quot;).

The verb classes in Arabic are formed along two axes. One axis (described as &quot;form I&quot;, &quot;form II&quot;, etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive, or reflexive, and involves varying the stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B &quot;write&quot; is derived form I kátab/yíktib &quot;write&quot;, form II káttib/yikáttib &quot;cause to write&quot;, form III ká:tib/yiká:tib &quot;correspond&quot;, etc. The other axis is determined by the particular consonants making up the root. For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. ráma/yírmi &quot;throw&quot; from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. gá:b/yigí:b &quot;bring&quot; from G-Y-B).

==== Strong verbs ====
Strong verbs are those that have no &quot;weakness&quot; (e.g. W or Y) in the root consonants.
Each verb has a given vowel pattern for Past (a or i) and Present (a or i or u). Combinations of each exist.

===== Regular verbs, form I =====

Form I verbs have a given vowel pattern for past (a or i) and present (a, i or u). Combinations of each exist:

===== Regular verb, form I, fáʕal/yífʕil =====

Example: kátab/yíktib &quot;write&quot;

Note that, in general, the present indicative is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of &quot;bi-&quot; (&quot;bi-a-&quot; is elided to &quot;ba-&quot;). Similarly, the future is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of &quot;ḥa-&quot; (&quot;ḥa-a-&quot; is elided to &quot;ḥa-&quot;). The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;bi-&quot; or in the following prefix will be deleted according to the regular rules of vowel syncope:
*híyya b-tíktib &quot;she writes&quot; (híyya + bi- + tíktib)
*híyya bi-t-ʃú:f &quot;she sees&quot; (híyya + bi- + tiʃú:f)
*an-áktib &quot;I write (subjunctive)&quot; (ána + áktib)

Example: kátab/yíktib &quot;write&quot;: non-finite forms

===== Regular verb, form I, fíʕil/yífʕal =====

Example: fíhim/yífham &quot;understand&quot;

Boldfaced forms fíhm-it and fíhm-u differ from the corresponding forms of katab (kátab-it and kátab-u due to vowel syncope). Note also the syncope in ána fhím-t &quot;I understood&quot;.

===== Regular verb, form II, fáʕʕil/yifáʕʕil =====

Example: dárris/yidárris &quot;teach&quot;

Boldfaced forms indicate the primary differences from the corresponding forms of katab:
*The prefixes &quot;ti-&quot;, &quot;yi-&quot;, &quot;ni-&quot; have elision of &quot;i&quot; following &quot;bi-&quot; or &quot;ḥa-&quot; (all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant behave this way).
*The imperative prefix &quot;i-&quot; is missing (again, all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant behave this way).
*Due to the regular operation of the stress rules, the stress in the past tense forms darrís-it and darrís-u differs from kátab-it and kátab-u.

===== Regular verb, form III, fá:ʕil/yifá:ʕil =====

Example: sá:fir/yisá:fir &quot;travel&quot;

The primary differences from the corresponding forms of darris (shown in boldface) are:
*The long vowel &quot;a:&quot; becomes &quot;a&quot; when unstressed.
*The &quot;i&quot; in the stem &quot;sa:fir&quot; is elided when a suffix beginning with a vowel follows.

==== Defective verbs ====

Defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant.

===== Defective verb, form I, fáʕa/yífʕi =====

Example: ráma/yírmi &quot;throw away&quot; (i.e. trash, etc.)

The primary differences from the corresponding forms of katab (shown in boldface) are:
*In the past, there are three stems: ráma with no suffix, ramé:- with a consonant-initial suffix, rám- with a vowel initial suffix.
*In the non-past, the stem rmi becomes rm- before a (vowel initial) suffix, and the stress remains on the prefix, since the stem vowel has been elided.
*Note also the accidental homonymy between masculine tí-rmi, í-rmi and feminine tí-rm-i, í-rm-i.

===== Defective verb, form I, fíʕi/yífʕa =====

Example: nísi/yínsa &quot;forget&quot;

This verb type is quite similar to the defective verb type ráma/yírmi. The primary differences are:
*The occurrence of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;a&quot; in the stems are reversed: &quot;i&quot; in the past, &quot;a&quot; in the non-past.
*In the past, instead of the stems ramé:- and rám-, the verb has nisí:- (with a consonant-initial suffix) and nísy- (with a vowel initial suffix). Note in particular the |y| in nísyit and nísyu as opposed to rámit and rámu.
*Elision of &quot;i&quot; in nisí:- can occur, e.g. ána nsí:t &quot;I forgot&quot;.
*In the non-past, because the stem has &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot;, there is no homonymy between masculine tí-nsa, í-nsa and feminine tí-ns-i, í-ns-i.

Some other verbs have different stem variations, e.g. míʃi/yímʃi &quot;walk&quot; (with &quot;i&quot; in both stems) and báʔa/yíbʔa &quot;become, remain&quot; (with &quot;a&quot; in both stems). The verb láʔa/yilá:ʔi &quot;find&quot; is unusual in having a mixture of a form I past and form III present (note also the variations líʔi/yílʔa and láʔa/yílʔa).

Verbs other than form I have consistent stem vowels. All such verbs have &quot;a&quot; in the past (hence form stems with &quot;-é:-&quot;, not &quot;-í:-&quot;). Forms V, VI, X and IIq have &quot;a&quot; in the present (indicated by boldface below); others have &quot;i&quot;; forms VII, VIIt, and VIII have &quot;i&quot; in both vowels of the stem (indicated by italics below); form IX verbs, including &quot;defective&quot; verbs, behave as regular doubled verbs:
* Form II: wádda/yiwáddi &quot;take away&quot;; ʔáwwa/yiʔáwwi &quot;strengthen&quot;
* Form III: ná:da/yiná:di &quot;call&quot;; dá:wa/yidá:wi &quot;treat, cure&quot;
* Form IV (rare, classicized): ʔárḍa/yírḍi &quot;please, satisfy&quot;
* Form V: itʔáwwa/yitʔáwwa &quot;become strong&quot;
* Form VI: itdá:wa/yitdá:wa &quot;be treated, be cured&quot;
* &quot;Form VII&quot; (rare in the Cairene dialect): inḥáka/yinḥíki &quot;be told&quot;
* &quot;Form VIIt&quot;: itnása/yitnísi &quot;be forgotten&quot;
* &quot;Form VIII&quot;: iʃtára/yiʃtíri &quot;buy&quot;
* Form IX (very rare): iḥláww/yiḥláww &quot;be/become sweet&quot;
* Form X: istákfa/yistákfa &quot;have enough&quot;
* Form Iq: &quot;need example&quot;
* Form IIq: &quot;need example&quot;

==== Hollow verbs ====
Hollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant. For some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II &quot;ʕáyyin/yiʕáyyin&quot; &quot;appoint&quot; from ʕ-Y-N, form III &quot;gá:wib/yigá:wib&quot; &quot;answer&quot; from G-W-B).

===== Hollow verb, form I, fá:l/yifí:l =====

Example: gá:b/yigí:b &quot;bring&quot;

This verb works much like dárris/yidárris &quot;teach&quot;. Like all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant, the prefixes differ in the following way from those of regular and defective form I verbs:
*The prefixes &quot;ti-&quot;, &quot;yi-&quot;, &quot;ni-&quot; have elision of &quot;i&quot; following &quot;bi-&quot; or &quot;ḥa-&quot;.
*The imperative prefix &quot;i-&quot; is missing.

In addition, the past tense has two stems: gíb- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and gá:b- elsewhere (third person).

===== Hollow verb, form I, fá:l/yifú:l =====

Example: ʃá:f/yiʃú:f &quot;see&quot;

This verb class is identical to verbs such as gá:b/yigí:b except in having stem vowel &quot;u&quot; in place of &quot;i&quot;.

==== Doubled verbs ====

Doubled verbs have the same consonant as middle and last root consonant, e.g. ḥább/yiḥíbb &quot;love&quot; from Ḥ-B-B.

===== Doubled verb, form I, fáʕʕ/yifíʕʕ =====

Example: ḥább/yiḥíbb &quot;love&quot;

This verb works much like gá:b/yigí:b &quot;bring&quot;. Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are ḥabbé:- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and ḥább- elsewhere (third person). &quot;é:-&quot; was borrowed from the defective verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *ḥabáb-, e.g. *ḥabáb-t.

Other verbs have &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; in the present stem: baṣṣ/yibúṣṣ &quot;to look&quot;, ṣaḥḥ/yiṣáḥḥ &quot;be right, be proper&quot;.

As for the other forms:
*Form II, V doubled verbs are strong: ḥáddid/yiḥáddid &quot;limit, fix (appointment)&quot;
*Form III, IV, VI, VIII doubled verbs seem non-existent
*Form VII and VIIt doubled verbs (same stem vowel &quot;a&quot; in both stems): inbáll/yinbáll &quot;be wetted&quot;, itʕádd/yitʕádd
*Form VIII doubled verbs (same stem vowel &quot;a&quot; in both stems): ihtámm/yihtámm &quot;be interested (in)&quot;
*Form IX verbs (automatically behave as &quot;doubled&quot; verbs, same stem vowel &quot;a&quot; in both stems): iḥmárr/yiḥmárr &quot;be red, blush&quot;, iḥláww/yiḥláww &quot;be sweet&quot;
*Form X verbs (stem vowel either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;i&quot; in non-past): istaḥáʔʔ/yistaḥáʔʔ &quot;deserve&quot; vs. istaʕádd/yistaʕídd &quot;be ready&quot;, istamárr/yistamírr &quot;continue&quot;.

==== Assimilated verbs ====

Assimilated verbs have W or Y as the first root consonant. Most of these verbs have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. wázan/yíwzin &quot;to weigh&quot; or wíṣíl/yíwṣal &quot;to arrive&quot;. Only a couple of irregular verbs remain, e.g. wíʔif/yúʔaf &quot;stop&quot; and wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ &quot;fall&quot; (see below).

==== Doubly weak verbs ====

&quot;Doubly weak&quot; verbs have more than one &quot;weakness&quot;, typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants. This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal defective verbs (e.g. káwa/yíkwi &quot;iron (clothes)&quot; from K-W-Y, ʔáwwa/yiʔáwwi &quot;strengthen&quot; from ʔ-W-Y, dá:wa/yidá:wi &quot;treat, cure&quot; from D-W-Y).

==== Irregular verbs ====

The irregular verbs are as follows:

*ídda/yíddi &quot;give&quot; (endings like a normal defective verb)
*wíʔif/yúʔaf &quot;stop&quot; and wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ &quot;fall&quot; (&quot;áʔaf, báʔaf, ḥáʔaf&quot; &quot;I (will) stop&quot;; úʔaf &quot;stop!&quot;)
*kal/yá:kul &quot;eat&quot; and xad/yá:xud &quot;take&quot; (&quot;kalt, kal, kálit, kálu&quot; &quot;I/he/she/they ate&quot;, also regular &quot;ákal, etc.&quot; &quot;he/etc. ate&quot;; &quot;á:kul, bá:kul, ḥá:kul&quot; &quot;I (will) eat&quot;, &quot;yáklu&quot; &quot;they eat&quot;; &quot;kúl, kúli, kúlu&quot; &quot;eat!&quot;; &quot;wá:kil&quot; &quot;eating&quot;; &quot;mittá:kil&quot; &quot;eaten&quot;)
*gé/yí:gi &quot;come&quot;. This verb is extremely irregular (with particularly unusual forms in boldface):

Example: gé/yí:gi &quot;come&quot;: non-finite forms

==== Table of verb forms ====

In this section all verb classes and their corresponding stems are listed, excluding the small number of irregular verbs described above. Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:
*F = first consonant of root
*M = middle consonant of three-consonant root
*S = second consonant of four-consonant root
*T = third consonant of four-consonant root
*L = last consonant of root
Hence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-ʕ-L and F-ʕ-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers, since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving &quot;ʕ&quot;.)

The following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number and gender, and the stem form to which they are added. The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix, and corresponding stem or , are highlighted in silver. The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix, and corresponding stem , are highlighted in gold. The forms involving a no suffix, and corresponding stem or , are unhighlighted.

The following table lists the verb classes along with the form of the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun, in addition to an example verb for each class.

Notes:
*Italicized forms are those that follow automatically from the regular rules of vowel shortening and deletion.
*Multisyllabic forms without a stress mark have variable stress, depending on the nature of the suffix added, following the regular rules of stress assignment.
*Many participles and verbal nouns have acquired an extended sense. In fact, participles and verbal nouns are the major sources for lexical items based on verbs, especially derived (i.e. non-Form-I) verbs.
*Some verb classes do not have a regular verbal noun form; rather, the verbal noun varies from verb to verb. Even in verb classes that do have a regular verbal noun form, there are exceptions. In addition, some verbs share a verbal noun with a related verb from another class (in particular, many passive verbs use the corresponding active verb&#x27;s verbal noun, which can be interpreted in either an active or passive sense). Some verbs appear to lack a verbal noun entirely. (In such a case, a paraphrase would be used involving a clause beginning with &quot;inn&quot;.)
*Outside of Form I, passive participles as such are usually non-existent; instead, the active participle of the corresponding passive verb class (e.g. Forms V, VI, VIIt/VIIn for Forms II, III, I respectively) is used. The exception is certain verbs in Forms VIII and X that contain a &quot;classicized&quot; passive participle that is formed in imitation of the corresponding participle in Classical Arabic, e.g. &quot;mistáʕmil&quot; &quot;using&quot;, &quot;mustáʕmal&quot; &quot;used&quot;.
*Not all forms have a separate verb class for hollow or doubled roots. When no such class is listed below, roots of that shape appear as strong verbs in the corresponding form, e.g. Form II strong verb &quot;ḍáyyaʕ/yiḍáyyaʕ&quot; &quot;waste, lose&quot; related to Form I hollow verb &quot;ḍá:ʕ/yiḍí:ʕ&quot; &quot;be lost&quot;, both from root Ḍ-Y-ʕ.

=== Negation ===

One characteristic feature of Egyptian syntax is the two-part negative verbal circumfix , which it shares with other North African dialect areas as well as some southern Levantine dialect areas, probably as a result of the influence of Egyptian Arabic on these areas:

* Past: &quot;he wrote&quot; &quot;he didn&#x27;t write&quot; 
* Present: &quot;he writes&quot; &quot;he doesn&#x27;t write&quot; 

 probably comes from the Arabic negator . This negating circumfix is similar in function to the French circumfix . It should also be noted that Coptic and Ancient Egyptian both had negative circumfix.

The structure can end in a consonant or in a vowel , varying according to the individual or region. Nowadays speakers use . However, was sometimes used stylistically, specially in the past, as attested in old films.

The negative circumfix often surrounds the entire verbal composite including direct and indirect object pronouns:
* &quot;he didn&#x27;t write them to me&quot;
However, verbs in the future tense can instead use the prefix /miʃ/:
* (or &quot;he won&#x27;t write&quot;
Interrogative sentences can be formed by adding the negation clitic &quot;(miʃ)&quot; before the verb:
* Past: &quot;he wrote&quot;; &quot;didn&#x27;t he write?&quot;
* Present: &quot;he writes&quot;; &quot;doesn&#x27;t he write?&quot;
* Future: &quot;he will write&quot;; &quot;won&#x27;t he write?&quot;
Addition of the circumfix can cause complex changes to the verbal cluster, due to the application of the rules of vowel syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion and elision described above:
* The addition of /ma-/ may trigger elision or syncope:
**A vowel following /ma-/ is elided: (ixtáːr) &quot;he chose&quot; → ().
**A short vowel /i/ or /u/ in the first syllable may be deleted by syncope: (kíbir) &quot;he grew&quot; → (makbírʃ).
* The addition of may result in vowel shortening or epenthesis:
** A final long vowel preceding a single consonant shortens: (ixtáːr) &quot;he chose&quot; → (maxtárʃ).
** An unstressed epenthetic /i/ is inserted when the verbal complex ends in two consonants: /kunt/ &quot;I was&quot; → (makúntiʃ).
* In addition, the addition of triggers a stress shift, which may in turn result in vowel shortening or lengthening:
** The stress shifts to the syllable preceding : (kátab) &quot;he wrote&quot; → (makatábʃ).
** A long vowel in the previously stressed syllable shortens: (ʃáːfit) &quot;she saw&quot; → (maʃafítʃ); (ʃá:fu) &quot;they saw&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;he saw it&quot; → (maʃafú:ʃ).
** A final short vowel directly preceding lengthens: (ʃáːfu) &quot;they saw&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;he saw it&quot; → (maʃafú:ʃ).

In addition, certain other morphological changes occur:
* (ʃafúː) &quot;they saw him&quot; → (maʃafuhúːʃ) (to avoid a clash with (maʃafúːʃ) &quot;they didn&#x27;t see/he didn&#x27;t see him&quot;).
* (ʃáːfik) &quot;He saw you (fem. sg.)&quot; → (maʃafkíːʃ).
* (ʃúftik) &quot;I saw you (fem. sg.)&quot; → (maʃuftikíːʃ).

== Syntax ==
In contrast with Classical Arabic, but much like the other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic prefers subject–verb–object (SVO) word order; CA and to a lesser extent MSA prefer verb–subject–object (VSO). For example, in MSA &quot;Adel read the book&quot; would be &#x27; whereas EA would say &#x27; .

Also in common with other Arabic varieties is the loss of unique agreement in the dual form: while the dual remains productive to some degree in nouns, dual nouns are analyzed as plural for the purpose of agreement with verbs, demonstratives, and adjectives. Thus &quot;These two Syrian professors are walking to the university&quot; in MSA (in an SVO sentence for ease of comparison) would be &quot; &quot; , which becomes in EA &quot;&quot; &quot;,&quot; .

Unlike most other forms of Arabic, however, Egyptian prefers final placement of question words in interrogative sentences. This is a feature characteristic of the Coptic substratum of Egyptian Arabic.

== Coptic substratum ==

Some authors have argued for the influence of a substratum of the Coptic language which was the native language of the vast majority of Nile Valley Egyptians prior to the Muslim invasion on Egyptian Arabic, specifically on its phonology, syntax, and lexicon. Coptic is the latest stage of the indigenous Egyptian language spoken until the mid-17th century when it was finally completely supplanted among Egyptian Muslims and a majority of Copts by the Egyptian Arabic.

=== Phonology ===
Since Coptic lacked interdental consonants it could possibly have influenced the manifestation of their occurrences in Classical Arabic as their dental counterparts and the emphatic dental respectively. (see consonants)

Behnstedt argues that the phenomenon of merging of interdentals with plosives has also occurred in areas without a substratum lacking interdentals, e.g. in Mecca, Aden and Bahrain, and can be caused by drift rather than the influence of a substratum concluding that &quot;[o]n the phonological level, there is no evidence for Coptic substratal influence.&quot;

=== Syntax ===
A syntactic feature of to Egyptian Arabic arguably inherited from Coptic is the remaining of interrogative words (i.e. &quot;who&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;why&quot;) in their &quot;logical&quot; positions in a sentence rather than being preposed, or moved to the front of the sentence, as in (mostly) in Classical Arabic or English.

Examples:
* &quot;When () did he go to Egypt?&quot; (lit. &quot;He went to Egypt when?&quot;)
* &quot;Why () did he go to Egypt? (lit. &quot;He went to Egypt why?&quot;)
* or &quot;Who () went to Egypt/Cairo? (literally – same order)
The same sentences in Literary Arabic (with all the question words (&quot;wh&quot;-words) in the beginning of the sentence) would be:
* 

Diem argues that in Cairene Arabic also the preposition of interrogative words occurs and in Classical Arabic and other Arabic dialects also their postposition and thus the effect of a Coptic substratum might be – if any – the preference for one of the two possibilities.

=== Lexicon ===
Behnstedt estimates the existence of ca. 250 to 300 Coptic loanwords in Egyptian Arabic.

== Orthography and romanization ==
=== Orthography ===
There is no fixed orthography for Egyptian Arabic.
Where it is written in Arabic script the orthography varies between spellings closer to those of Standard Arabic and spellings closer to the phonology of Egyptian Arabic.
This variability arises from the deficiency of the Arabic script for writing the colloquial Egyptian Arabic, for which it is not designed. Part of this is the unavailability of signs for some sounds of Egyptian Arabic that are not part of Standard Arabic.
Both options are used in parallel, often even in by one author or in one work.
The two options appears for example for these cases:
* treatment of originally long vowels that become short or deleted as a result of vowel shortening or vowel deletion, e.g. the feminine active participle of , that is pronounced , can be written in two ways:
** etymological spelling with the shortly pronounced originally long vowel &quot;ا&quot;: ,
** phonetic spelling without the &quot;ا&quot;: ;
* words written with the letters &quot;ث&quot;‎, &quot;ذ&quot;, and &quot;ظ&quot; in Standard Arabic that are pronounced , , and in Egyptian Arabic can keep their etymological Standard Arabic spelling or be phonetically respelled with &quot;ت&quot;‎, &quot;د&quot; and &quot;ض&quot;.

=== Romanization ===
In the table below romanizations by different authors starting with Spitta&#x27;s from 1880 are given as examples of the variety of those used.
Where authors use custom glyphs the ones given try the best available approximation.
The use of transcribing glyphs among different authors and between those and a representation of Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script (in doubt is used below) can not be exactly aligned because different authors use different analyses of the studied language. Here also the table below tries to give a good approximation.

== Sociolinguistic features ==
Egyptian Arabic is used in most social situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic generally being used only in writing and in highly religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, there is a wide range of variation. El-Said Badawi identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic-based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: &quot;ʿĀmmiyyat al-Musaqqafīn&quot; (Cultured Colloquial or Formal Spoken Arabic), &quot;ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn&quot; (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and &quot;ʿĀmmiyyat al-&#x27;Ummiyīn&quot; (Illiterate Colloquial). Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is still Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA and closer attention to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly &quot;qāf&quot;). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, it is understood fairly well across the Arab world. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost-exclusively Arabic vocabulary; the few loanwords generally are very old borrowings (e.g. &#x27;, &quot;shrimp&quot;, from Italian &quot;gamberi&quot;, &quot;shrimp&quot; (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. &#x27; , television). Enlightened Colloquial (&quot;ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn&quot;) is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to items of popular culture, consumer products, and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Egyptian cinema and television.

In contrast to MSA and most other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic has a form of the T-V distinction. In the singular, &quot;enta&quot;/&quot;enti&quot; is acceptable in most situations, but to address clear social superiors (e.g. older persons, superiors at work, certain government officials), the form &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Your Grace&quot; is preferred (compare Spanish &quot;usted&quot;).

This use of &quot;&quot; is linked to the system of honorifics in daily Egyptian speech. The honorific taken by a given person is determined by their relationship to the speaker and their occupation.

Other honorifics also exist.

In usage, honorifics are used in the second and third person.

== Study ==
Egyptian Arabic has been a subject of study by scholars and laypersons in the past and the present for many reasons, including personal interest, egyptomania, business, news reporting, and diplomatic and political interactions. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is now a field of study in both graduate and undergraduate levels in many higher education institutions and universities in the world. When added to academic instruction, Arabic-language schools and university programs provide Egyptian Arabic courses in a classroom fashion, and others facilitate classes for online study.

<text>Bell MTS Inc. (formerly Manitoba Telecom Services) is a subsidiary of BCE Inc. that operates telecommunications services in Manitoba.

Originally established as Manitoba Government Telephones after the Government of Manitoba purchased the Manitoba assets of Bell Canada, the corporation was privatized in 1996. On March 17, 2017, Bell regained control of MTS after the Bell Canada group&#x27;s holding company BCE Inc. closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the provider and, for regulatory reasons, Bell divested approximately one third of MTS&#x27;s wireless business (including subscribers and retail outlets) to Telus, and a smaller portion to the new entrant Xplornet. Under Bell ownership, Bell MTS will serve as the headquarters of Bell&#x27;s telecom businesses in western Canada.

==History==
=== Beginning ===
One of the first two telephone subscribers in Manitoba was Winnipeg businessman James Henry Ashdown in 1881.

=== Early 20th century ===
MTS is the descendant company of Manitoba Government Telephones, which went into operation in January 1908 after the government of Manitoba bought Bell Canada&#x27;s Manitoba operations. The Crown corporation became Manitoba Telephone System in 1921, and eventually took over all private telephone operations in the province.

=== 1940s ===
MTS announced in late 1947 that it would modernize its long-distance equipment in both Winnipeg and Brandon, using Siemens Brothers switching equipment, to better handle routing of automatic dialing of long-distance calls by telephone operators using the currently known Area Code system. To accomplish this, MTS needed to expand its Corydon Ave. long-distance switching centre by adding four additional storeys to the building. Initial communities to be set up with the new long-distance hardware included Boissevain, Deloraine, Dauphin, Kenton, Melita, Waskada, Lyleton, Tilston, Portage la Prairie, Pierson.

A trial of Mobile radio-telephone service, a technology that was developed by AT&amp;T, took place early in 1948. An earlier trial of wireless telephone service was conducted in northern Manitoba mining towns.

===1950s===
At midnight on June 21, 1959, Winnipeg was the first urban area in North America to implement the 9-9-9 emergency telephone number.

Also in the late 1950s, MTS located one of its administrative offices on Empress St. near the newly opened Polo Park Shopping Centre complex. In 2000 these employees were moved to 333 Main St., commonly known as &quot;MTS Place&quot;, where 1,500 employees now work. This formed part of the Province&#x27;s &quot;Downtown First&quot; strategy.

===1970s===
In the late 1970s, similar to policy changes implemented by AT&amp;T in the U.S., MTS allowed its customers to purchase their own telephone equipment and with this, provided free installation of RJ11 telephone jacks.

In July 1979, MTS announced that it would be a pioneer in Telidon-based two-way electronic information services. The trial was called &quot;Project IDA&quot; and ran from 1980 to 1981.

===1980s===
MTS was a pioneer in offering videotex at the commercial level. In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to DATAPAC. Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak.

They opened &quot;MTS Phone Centre&quot; stores in shopping malls to sell residential and business phones and services, and in 1984 opened two &quot;MTS Business Centre&quot; locations (Commodity Exchange Tower lobby and Empress St. office) to provide sales of business-level equipment.

In the mid-1980s, MTS started a subsidiary known as MTX, which had invested in telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. However MTX was forced to shut down after controversy about the company back in Manitoba after MTX lost $27 million on the venture.

In the late 1980s MTS launched MTS Mobility providing cellular and paging services in Manitoba after competitor Cantel was allowed to set up the cellular radio infrastructure and market the service before MTS.

===1990s===
In 1996, the Provincial government of Premier Gary Filmon decided to sell the Manitoba Telephone System to private shareholders. The decision to privatize was seen as controversial, as it marked a significant departure from the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; earlier position that MTS should remain provincially owned.

In January 1999, MTS partnered with &quot;Bell Canada&quot; to form &quot;Intrigna&quot;, a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) which was created to expand telecommunications options for the business market in Alberta and British Columbia. As part of the deal, &quot;Bell Canada&quot; gained 20% ownership of MTS. They set up a jointly operated office in Calgary. By the summer of 1999, fibre optic cable had been laid in Edmonton and Calgary, and later extended to Vancouver, British Columbia.

In August 1999, MTS completed work on a new trunked (digital) radio system known as &quot;FleetNet 800&quot;, technology licensed from neighbouring SaskTel.

In the Fall of 1999, MTS began to offer DSL high-speed Internet service in Winnipeg and Brandon, which later expanded to other areas of the province.

===2000s===

The CRTC met with the various telecommunications providers in Canada and required of them to implement a &quot;Service Improvement Plan&quot; (SIP). This meant that MTS had to improve service to northern remote areas that even by the 21st century had poor quality phone service. Customers in northern Manitoba complained that the microwave system could not handle data communications (modem, fax) well. This, as well as the collapse of a microwave relay tower linking Churchill in early January 2000, lead MTS to initiate upgrades to the Radisson-Churchill corridor with fibre optics and the Lynn Lake-Thompson corridor with a digital microwave system to replace the outdated equipment.
Cellular telephone service is currently available to 98% of population in the province.

In 2003, MTS purchased the naming rights for the True North Centre in downtown Winnipeg, renaming it the MTS Centre. The 10-year deal between True North Sports &amp; Entertainment and MTS, which was MTS&#x27;s single largest advertising expenditure, was extended when the arena became a National Hockey League venue in 2011.

In February 2004, MTS sold its 40% stake in Intrigna to Bell Canada for $230 million.
In April 2004, MTS acquired Allstream, the successor to the transcontinental railways&#x27; telegraph businesses. It renamed the main subsidiary to MTS Allstream Inc. until 2012, when it was split as MTS Inc. and Allstream Inc.

On December 7, 2005, former BCE executive Pierre Blouin was named chief executive officer of Manitoba Telecom Services and of MTS Allstream, replacing longtime CEO Bill Fraser.

===2010s===

On March 31, 2011 MTS officially launched a HSPA+ wireless network along with the availability Apple&#x27;s iPhone series of smartphones starting with the iPhone 4. The wireless network had claims it would provide data speeds up to 21 Mbit/s. Also in 2011, MTS unveiled a new campaign featuring an animated version of their mascot, Morty the Bison. In September 2012, MTS launched LTE, with it initially rolling out in the cities of Winnipeg and Brandon.

MTS&#x27; older CDMA network continues to work with CDMA handsets. According to the MTS website, MTS plans on shutting down its CDMA service by the end of 2016.

In May 2013, Allstream was to be sold to Accelero Capital, with the deal expected to close by the end of the year. However, on October 7, 2013, the Canadian government blocked the sale over national security concerns, declining to mention the specific concerns.

In November 2014, Jay A. Forbes was appointed as CEO effective January 1, 2015.

On November 23, 2015 it was announced that Allstream Inc would be sold to Zayo Group in a cash transaction deal worth $465 million.

==== Acquisition by Bell ====
On May 2, 2016, BCE Inc. announced that it would acquire MTS in a $3.9 billion all-stock deal, paying $40 per-share and assuming $800 million in debt. Following the closure of this purchase pending regulatory approval, the company will operate as Bell MTS, a subsidiary of Bell Canada; the acquisition was expected to be closed in late-2016 to early 2017. Bell committed to investing $1 billion over five years into expanding broadband service in Manitoba, and upgrading MTS&#x27;s infrastructure to support new services, including Bell Fibe and LTE-Advanced. Bell will also base its Western Canadian operations out of Bell MTS in Winnipeg, increasing its staff to 6,900 employees. As a condition of the sale, Bell agreed to divest one-third of MTS Mobility&#x27;s wireless subscribers and MTS retail locations to Telus; the divestment aimed to give the three national carriers (Bell, Rogers, and Telus) a roughly equal market share in Manitoba.

The deal faced criticism for the possibility that it would result in a higher cost of services. Due to the market positioning of MTS as a fourth major wireless carrier in the region, the three major national carriers have historically offered lower prices in Manitoba to remain competitive. As such, with the removal of a competitor, there would no longer be an incentive to do so. A similar business climate exists in Saskatchewan, where the three national carriers must compete against the dominant, government-owned regional carrier SaskTel. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 61% of those surveyed moderately or strongly disapproved of the deal.

On December 20, 2016, the CRTC approved the sale of MTS&#x27;s broadcast distribution undertakings to Bell. On February 15, 2017, the deal was approved by the Competition Bureau and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. To relieve concerns over the reduction of wireless competition in Manitoba post-merger, Bell additionally agreed to divest 24,700 customers, 6 retail locations, and wireless spectrum to rural internet provider Xplornet so it may launch its own competing wireless business. Bell will provide Xplornet with &quot;expedited access&quot; to its towers for five years, as well as roaming and handset stock. This aspect of the deal will maintain the presence of four competing wireless providers in Manitoba, with the fourth being a new entrant to the market.

The acquisition closed on March 17, 2017; at this time, Dan McKeen (who led the integration of Bell Aliant into the company&#x27;s national operations) was installed as the new head of the division, replacing the outgoing Jay Forbes. Along with the closure of the deal, Bell launched LTE service in Churchill, Manitoba. Bell stated that it intended to maintain MTS&#x27;s existing wireless pricing structure for at least a year after the closure of the acquisition. Rates for all other Bell MTS services were raised in September 2017. The MTS Centre was renamed to Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017, following Bell Canada’s acquisition of MTS.

In October 2018, Bell MTS began to integrate its wireless subscribers into the national Bell Mobility business.

In late August 2019, BellMTS announced that it will no longer serve some rural communities with wireless Internet service via the &quot;rural Internet program&quot; because of a decrease in wholesale fees mandated by the CRTC.

On June 15, 2021, following the expiration of Bell MTS’ naming rights, True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, the operator of Bell MTS Place, announced that the naming rights to the arena had been sold to Canada Life under a 10-year agreement. 

==Facilities==
The administration offices are located at 333 Main St. in Winnipeg, in the former Bank of Montreal Building. The complex is now known as &quot;MTS Place&quot;.

The &quot;MTS Long Distance Gateway&quot; is located in the J.F. Mills Building on Corydon Avenue near what is locally known as Confusion Corner. One of its functions is to transmit local television signals from Winnipeg to retransmitters throughout the province. However, since 2011 MTS no longer transmits CBC television and Radio-Canada television signals by satellite and since no longer performs this function for CTV as satellites and fibre-optic technologies have replaced. Bell MTS is the former naming rights holder of a venue in Winnipeg, the Bell MTS Iceplex.

== Services ==
=== Fibe TV ===
Bell MTS operates an IPTV service, Bell MTS Fibe TV (formerly MTS Ultimate TV), which is available in Brandon, Carberry, Dauphin, Killarney, Minnedosa, Neepawa, Oakbank, Portage la Prairie, Selkirk, Steinbach, The Pas, Thompson, and Winnipeg. The service launched in 2009 and is based on Ericsson Mediaroom middleware. MTS Classic TV was the company&#x27;s legacy digital television service; it was discontinued in 2015 due to its incompatibility with Alert Ready. The service was updated and rebranded as Fibe TV in November 2017 (unifying it with the Fibe TV-branded services it offers in the Atlantic and Ontario), adding new features such as &quot;Restart&quot;.

===Cable TV===
Bell MTS also offers cable television service in Carman, Holland, Manitou, Miami, Morris, Notre Dame de Lourdes, Plum Coulee, St. Claude, St. Jean Baptiste, Treherne, Altona, Morden, and Winkler.

<text>Yemeni Arabic () is a cluster of varieties of Arabic spoken in Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia. It is generally considered a very conservative dialect cluster, having many classical features not found across most of the Arabic-speaking world.

Yemeni Arabic can be divided roughly into several main dialect groups, each with its own distinctive vocabulary and phonology. The four most important groups are San&#x27;ani in the North and Centre and Hadhrami in the East, where is pronounced and is or (except in coastal Hadhrami where is ), in addition to Ta&#x27;izzi-Adeni in the South and Tihami in the West, where is and is . Yemeni Arabic is used for daily communications and has no official status; Modern Standard Arabic is used for official purposes, education, commerce and media.

Non-Arabic South Semitic languages indigenous to the region include several Modern South Arabian languages, such as the Mehri and Soqotri languages, which are members of an independent branch of the Semitic family. Another separate Semitic family once spoken in the region is Old South Arabian; these became extinct in the pre-Islamic period with the possible exceptions of Razihi and Faifi. Some of these share areal features with Yemeni Arabic owing to influence from or on Yemeni Arabic.

Yemeni Arabic itself is influenced by Himyaritic, Modern South Arabian and Old South Arabian languages and possesses significant substratum from these languages.

==San&#x27;ani Arabic dialect==
==Ta&#x27;izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect==
==Tihamiyya Arabic==

Tihamiyya Arabic has many aspects that differentiate it from all other dialects in the Arab world. Phonologically Tihami is similar to the majority of Yemeni dialects, pronouncing the &#x27; () as and the &#x27; () as a velar plosive (the &quot;&quot; pronunciation is also shared with Egyptian Arabic). Grammatically, all Tihami dialects also share the unusual feature of replacing the definite article (&quot;al-&quot;) with the prefix (&quot;am-&quot;). The future tense, much as in the dialects surrounding Sana&#x27;a, is indicated with the prefix (&quot;š-&quot;) for all persons, e.g. &quot;šabūk am-sūq&quot; &quot;I shall go to the market”. Some Tihami dialects, such as that spoken in al Hudaydah, are otherwise fairly similar to other Yemeni dialects in grammar and syntax, differing mainly in vocabulary, while others can be so far from any other Arabic dialect that they are practically incomprehensible even to other Yemenis.

===Zabidi dialect===
Of all the dialects of the Tihama region, the dialect of Zabid displays the most innovations. It shares the transformed definite article of (&quot;am-&quot;) originally used in Himyaritic with the rest of the Tihami dialects, but it is unique in retaining certain of the declensional suffixes in the nominative case. Indefinite masculine nouns in nominal sentences as well as the subjects of verbal sentences are suffixed with the sound (&quot;-ū&quot;), which stems from the classical suffix (&quot;-un/-u&quot;). Likewise the phonology of the Zabidi sub-dialect replaces the sound (&quot;ʿain&quot;) (ع) with the glottal stop ( ʾ ) (ء). In terms of vocabulary, the Zabidi dialect shares very little with other Arabic dialects, in many respects seeming to be a different language. Zabidis use the verb &quot;bāka&quot;, &quot;yabūk&quot;, to mean ‘to go’, the word &quot;goh#d&quot; and &quot;goh#da&quot; to mean ‘man’ and ‘woman’ respectively and the word &quot;fiyān&quot; to mean ‘where’, hence the phrase: &quot;fiyān bāyku?&quot; meaning ‘Where are you going?’, which is grammatically parallel to the more familiar: &quot;wayn rāyih?&quot; of more mainstream dialects. (citation?)

==Hadhrami Arabic dialect==
===Phonology===
The Hadhrami dialect in many towns and villages in the &quot;Wādī&quot; (valley) and the coastal region is characterised by its pronunciation of the voiced palatal plosive (or affricate) (ج) as the semi-vowel (ي) (&quot;y&quot;) (). In this it resembles some Eastern Arabian and Gulf dialects including the dialects of Basra in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the other Arab Emirates. In educated speech (ج) is realised as a voiced palatal implosive () or affricate () in some lexical items.

The ق reflex is pronounced as a voiced velar in all lexical items throughout the dialect. With the spread of literacy and contact with speakers of other Arabic dialects, future sociolinguistic research may reveal whether HA is going to witness innovation such as using the uvular in certain lexemes while retaining the velar for others.

Wādī HA makes ث / ت , (, ) and ذ / د , (, ) distinction but ض (Classical Arabic ) and ظ are both pronounced ظ whereas Coastal HA merges all these pairs into the stops د , ت and ض (/t/, /d/ and /ḍ/) respectively.

In non-emphatic environments, (ā) is realised as an open front (slightly raised) unrounded vowel. Thus
(θānī) “second; psn. name”, which is normally realised with an -like quality in the Gulf dialects, is realised with an quality in HA.

This dialect is characterised by not allowing final consonant clusters to occur in final position. Thus Classical Arabic &quot;bint&quot; ‘girl’ is realised as &quot;binit&quot;. In initial positions there is a difference between the Wādī and the coastal varieties of HA. Coastal HA has initial clusters in (bġā) ‘he wants’, (&quot;bṣal&quot;) ‘onions’ and (&quot;brīd&quot;) ‘mail (n.)’, whilst Wādī HA realises the second and third words as (&quot;baṣal&quot;) and (barīd) respectively.

===Morphology===
When the first person singular comes as an independent subject pronoun, it is marked for gender, thus (anā) for masculine and (anī) for feminine. As an object pronoun it comes as a bound morpheme, thus (–nā) for masculine and (–nī) for feminine. The first person subject plural is (naḥnā).

The first person direct object plural is (naḥnā) rather than (–nā) as in many dialects. Thus the cognate of the Classical Arabic (ḍarabanā), ‘he hit us’, is (đ̣arab naḥnā) in HA.

Stem VI, (tC1āC2aC3), can undergo a vowel stem shift to (tC1ēC2aC3), thus changing the pattern vowel (ā) to (ē). This leads to a semantic change as in (tšāradaw), ‘they ran away suddenly’, and (tšēradaw), ‘they shirk, try to escape’.

Intensive and frequentative verbs are common in the dialect. Thus /kasar/ ‘to break’ is intensified to /kawsar/ as in (kōsar fi l - l‘ib), ‘he played rough’. It can be metathesized to become frequentative as (kaswar min iđ̣-đ̣aḥkāt), ‘he made a series (lit. breaks) of giggles or laughs’.

===Syntax===
The syntax of HA has many similarities to other Peninsular Arabic dialects. However the dialect contains a number of unique particles used for coordination, negation and other sentence types. Examples in coordination include (kann, lākan) ‘but; nevertheless, though’, (mā) (Classical Arabic &quot;ammā)&quot; ‘as for’ and (walla) ‘or’.

Like many other dialects, apophonic or ablaut passive (as in /kutib/ ‘it was written’) is not very common in HA and perhaps is confined to clichés and proverbs from other dialects including Classical Arabic.

The particle /qad/ developed semantically in HA into /kuð/ or /guð/ ‘yet, already, almost, nearly’ and /gad/ or /gid/ ‘maybe, perhaps’.

===Vocabulary===
There are a few lexical items that are shared with Modern South Arabian languages, which perhaps distinguish this dialect from other neighbouring Arabian Peninsula dialects. The effect of Hadrami migration to Southeast Asia (see Arab Singaporeans), the Indian subcontinent and East Africa on HA is clear in the vocabulary especially in certain registers such as types of food and dress, e.g. (ṣārūn) &quot;sarong&quot;. Many loan words were listed in al-Saqqaf (2006):

==Yafi&#x27;i Arabic dialect==
While there is much about the Lower Yafa&#x27;i dialect that has not been thoroughly studied, it has a very interesting phonological shift. Along with the southern bedouin dialects, in Abyan and Lahej, with which it shares much in common, Yafi&#x27;i pronounces the classical &quot;jīm&quot; (ج) as &quot;gīm&quot;, but unlike all other dialects, Yafi&#x27;i systematically pronounces the classical sound &quot;ġayn&quot; () as &quot;qain&quot; and &quot;qāf&quot; as &quot;ġāf&quot;, effectively switching the pronunciation of one letter for the other. An illustration of the phonemic interchange can be seen in the Yafi&#x27;i words baġar “cow” and qanam “goat”, which correspond to the classical words baqar “cow” and ġanam “goat”.

Although a similar phonological shift occurs in certain words in the Sudan, the similarities are rather misleading. Whereas the shift is systematic in Yafi&#x27;, occurring at every instance of the relevant phonemes, in Sudan, it is usually a form of hypercorrection that takes place only in certain classical words. In Sudan, the phoneme is systematically pronounced in all common words, with the pronunciation &quot;ġ&quot; occurring as a hypercorrection in words such as &quot;istiqlāl&quot; &quot;independence&quot;, pronounced &quot;istighlāl&quot; (meaning ‘exploitation’ in Standard Arabic).

==Career==
Sanz performed at various theaters in Chicago, including The Court Theater and The Second City, where he was a member of their Chicago ETC theater.

At the beginning of &quot;SNL&quot;″s 31st season, he was the temporary replacement for Tina Fey as Amy Poehler&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; co-anchor while Fey was on maternity leave until she resumed her duties on October 22, 2005. On September 20, 2006, &quot;SNL&quot; announced that Sanz would not be returning due to budget cuts.

Sanz returned to &quot;SNL&quot; as a guest on February 3, 2007, appearing as Elton John, and on November 3, as presidential candidate Bill Richardson and again on the December 17, 2011, Christmas show as himself in a musical number (&quot;I Wish It Was Christmas Today&quot;) and as a member of Beethoven&#x27;s orchestra (&quot;Beethoven: Meet The Band&quot;).

===After &quot;SNL&quot;===
Sanz was part of the cast of the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;In the Motherhood&quot; in 2009, playing the role of Horatio the &quot;manny&quot; (male nanny). In 2010, Sanz and his former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Chris Parnell starred together on &quot;Big Lake&quot;, a Comedy Central sitcom from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. From 2010 to 2011, Sanz was a writer and producer on the Comedy Central sketch series &quot;Nick Swardson&#x27;s Pretend Time&quot;.

In 2015, he started his own podcast called &quot;The Hooray Show&quot;, which features comedy sketches and interviews with his friends in comedy.

Sanz appeared as a guest on &quot;The Big Alakens&quot;, the &quot;Big Lake&quot; marathon fundraiser episode of &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
In November 2008, Sanz made his first public appearance in almost a year, after having lost . &quot;I&#x27;ve been eating better&quot;, Sanz said. &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to come up with a joke about how I&#x27;ve lost weight and I was going to say, &#x27;I stopped putting nuts in my sundaes. He also says, &quot;I never weighed myself when I was at my fattest, because I was scared I might die&#x27;.&quot; Sanz says he has been working out, too.

He became an American citizen on July 25, 2018, in Los Angeles, California.

===Sexual assault allegation===
On August 12, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against Sanz, accusing him of sexual assault. The plaintiff, remaining anonymous, claimed that Sanz groped her and made sexual comments to her when she was under the age of 18. The lawsuit also stated that both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and NBC permitted and enabled him to groom and harm her, and accused Sanz of a direct assault that allegedly happened in front of other staff members in May 2002. Sanz responded through his attorney, calling the allegations &quot;categorically false.&quot;

NBCUniversal filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in April 2022, stating &quot;Employers owe no general duty to protect third-persons from the possibility of sexual abuse by their employees&quot;. In August 2022, the accuser requested that Jimmy Fallon, Tracy Morgan, and Lorne Michaels be added to the lawsuit as defendants, alleging they enabled Sanz&#x27;s behavior. On November 23, 2022, Sanz settled with the accuser and the lawsuit was dismissed.

<doc id="706844" wikidata="Q3450403" url="?curid=706844" title="Wellington Street (Ottawa)">
<text>Wellington Street () is a major street in Ottawa, Canada. It is notable for being the main street of the Parliamentary Precinct of the Parliament of Canada. It is one of the first two streets laid out in Bytown in 1826 (the other being the eastern leg of Wellington, Rideau Street). The street runs from Vimy Place, just west of Booth Street, to the Rideau Canal where it connects with Rideau Street and delimits the northern border of the downtown core. It is named after the Duke of Wellington, in recognition of his role in the creation of the Rideau Canal, and therefore of Ottawa (see History of Ottawa).
==Route description==
Starting at its easternmost point, Wellington forms the northern edge of Confederation Square, south of which runs Elgin Street. West of Confederation Square, Parliament Hill can be found on its north side, while the Langevin Block, home of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and of the Privy Council Office, the former American embassy and the Wellington Building can be found to the south. West of the intersection with Bank Street, are located the Confederation Building and the Justice Building (still considered within the Parliamentary Precinct), while the headquarters of the Bank of Canada can be found opposite the Hill.

Beyond Parliament Hill, the Supreme Court of Canada is situated west of the Justice building, and opposite St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church. The East and West Memorial Buildings are located east and west of Lyon Street, respectively, and linked by the Memorial Arch. West of the Supreme Court is the National Library and Archives of Canada main building, with the Garden of the Provinces across the street. Between the Supreme Court and the National Library is a large open area that is today a mix of parkland and large parking lots. Until the 1970s, this was home to a cluster of temporary buildings that had been erected in the Second World War to provide much-needed office space. In the 1970s, there was a plan to build both a home for the Federal Court and the National Gallery. A design competition was even held for the National Gallery, but in the end, the government cancelled both projects. 

Wellington Street continues west past the Portage Bridge, north of the eastern half of the LeBreton Flats, and becomes the Kichi Zībī Mīkan after crossing Vimy Place at LeBreton Flats Park near the Canadian War Museum.

West of the O-Train Bayview station, a separate segment (originally an extension of the same street) is known as Wellington Street West, and passes through the Hintonburg and Island Park neighbourhoods before becoming Richmond Road at Island Park Drive. Prior to the 1980s, Wellington Street extended southwest to meet with Richmond Road at Broad Street, and Richmond Road continued over the C.P.R. tracks on a bridge to what is now Wellington street West. The easternmost portion of this section remains as part of Commissioner Street and feeds into the eastbound lanes of Wellington Street east of the Portage Bridge interchange.

Both sections of Wellington are four-lane historic urban arterial roads with a speed limit of 50 km/h (30 mph), although the flow is generally slower than that due to high pedestrian traffic.

==Street naming==

===Alternate names===
From Bronson Avenue until Rideau Street, Wellington is also known as Ottawa Road #34. From Western Avenue to Somerset Street, Wellington is known as Ottawa Road #36.

===Street renaming===
A number of proposals have been made to change the street&#x27;s name (to honour Sir John A. Macdonald or Pierre E. Trudeau, for example), some as recent as 2010.

<text>The Crime Syndicate are teams of supervillains from one of DC Comics&#x27; parallel universes where they are the evil counterparts of the Justice League. The original team was specifically known as the Crime Syndicate of America and is sometimes abbreviated as CSA. This first superpowered Crime Syndicate team appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #29 in August 1964. The primary successive incarnation, known as the Crime Syndicate of Amerika (with the variant spelling of America), first appeared in the 2000 &quot;&quot; graphic novel.

A related successive group on Earth-3 is known as the Crime Society (of America) and first appeared in &quot;52&quot; #52, and was later featured in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;. A &quot;Golden Age&quot; supervillain group, the Crime Society was to Earth-2 what the Antimatter Crime Syndicate of Amerika was to Earth-0, until it was removed from continuity following DC&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline and &quot;The New 52&quot; company-wide reboot. Following this, a singular Crime Syndicate is the Earth-3 counterpart of the Earth-0 Justice League, first appearing in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #23 (October 2013), and the main focus of the company-wide crossover storyline &quot;Forever Evil&quot;. The events of that storyline have far-reaching consequences for the DC Universe and for the Crime Syndicate characters who survived and that remained on Earth-0 in one form or another after its events.

== Publication history ==
=== Crime Syndicate of America ===

As detailed in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #29 (August 1964), the Crime Syndicate of America originally lived on Earth-Three, a world where history was &quot;reversed&quot; from the real world (e.g., Christopher Columbus discovered Europe, British colonists declared their independence from America, and President John Wilkes Booth was assassinated by actor Abraham Lincoln). It initially had no superheroes, only the supervillains of the Crime Syndicate, though this changed with the later introduction of the heroic Lex Luthor who used his vast intelligence for good.
In their first appearance, the Crime Syndicate, bored with the ease with which they were able to commit crimes on their Earth (and with no one to truly challenge them), discovered the existence of Earth-One and Earth-Two after Ultraman got &quot;Ultra-Vision&quot; from exposure to a large chunk of kryptonite and found he could peer between worlds. Intrigued by the existence of superheroes, they crossed the dimensional void and attacked the JLA and JSA. The villains were at first defeated but when they said the word &quot;Volthoom&quot;, they sent themselves into Earth-Three thanks to a fail-safe created by Power Ring. The CSA was then able to capture the JSA by transporting them to Earth-Three and imprisoning them, intending to fight the JLA on Earth-2 to prove their superiority (the JLA had a natural advantage on Earth-1 and the CSA had a similar advantage on Earth-3, Earth-2 being chosen as a neutral environment where neither group would have an edge). However, the JLA defeated the CSA by tricking the members into unleashing more power than they could control, such as Ultraman acquiring so many powers he could not use any of them, Power Ring&#x27;s ring generating constructs that were too large for him to control after Green Lantern gave it a boost, and Wonder Woman allowing Superwoman to &#x27;steal&#x27; her Lasso of Truth, knowing that her opponent would not be able to use both of them. Following this defeat, the JLA freed the captured JSA heroes and imprisoned the CSA in an unbreakable bubble generated by Green Lantern&#x27;s power ring that was placed in a &quot;limbo&quot; dimension between the Earths, where time has no meaning.

Over the ensuing years, the CSA or one of its members would occasionally escape and attempt to wreak havoc on Earth-One and/or Earth-Two. Power Ring, Johnny Quick, and Superwoman battled Captain Comet after being released by the Secret Society of Super Villains.

Ultraman once escaped and collaborated with Lex Luthor of Earth-One and Alexei Luthor of Earth-Two, but was defeated by Superman of Earth-One, Superman of Earth-Two, and Alexander Luthor Sr. of Earth-Three and was returned to his limbo prison.

On one occasion, the entire CSA were released by the time travelling villain Per Degaton when he was caught up in a time storm and stumbled upon their limbo prison. He freed them and they reluctantly agreed to help him take over his homeworld of Earth-Two in his present time of 1942 by stealing nuclear missiles from the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis of Earth-Prime. When they inevitably tried to double-cross him, a safety protocol he had created hurled the traitors uncontrollably into the time stream, where they landed coincidentally on the satellite headquarters of the JLA in the then-present day of 1982 (the year the story was published). An intricate tale then followed, involving the CSA escaping and the JLA traveling back in time to Earth-Two in 1942 and Earth-Prime in 1962 to prevent the CSA from helping Degaton. It was during the Earth-Two visit to the past that the JLA teamed up with America&#x27;s superhero team of that era, the All-Star Squadron. The heroes succeeded in stopping Per Degaton and the CSA before their evil plan could be set in motion, effectively wiping these events from existence and everyone&#x27;s memory.

Earth-Three and the original CSA were destroyed, along with the rest of DC&#x27;s parallel worlds, in the 1985 12-issue maxiseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. As shown in issue #1, Earth-Three and all of its inhabitants were obliterated by an antimatter wave that was the catalyst for the story. The original Earth-Three Syndicate made a few Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearances, when Ultraman and Power Ring appeared in the &quot;Animal Man&quot; series and then again in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, when Earth-Three was temporarily recreated and models of the Earth-Three Ultraman, Superwoman, and Alexander Luthor Sr. were briefly merged with the Superman and Wonder Woman of Earth-1 and the Superman of Earth-Two and Wonder Woman of Earth-Two.

During the &quot;Convergence&quot; storyline, the Crime Syndicate had accidentally killed the Earth-Three version of Bruno Mannheim where Superwoman was arrested and sentenced to death. Despite the dome being over their Metropolis, Ultraman, Owlman, Power Ring, and Johnny Quick worked to infiltrate the prison and free Superwoman. Due to the interference of the Rogue Hunters, the Crime Syndicate failed to save Superwoman as the electric chair was activated. As the Rogue Hunters placed the shackles on the Crime Syndicate members, the domes fall around the cities as the Crime Syndicate breaks free. The Crime Syndicate soon found themselves fighting against Justice Legion Alpha from the 853rd Century&#x27;s Metropolis.

=== Crime Syndicate of Qward ===
A Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of the team, simply known as the &quot;Crime Syndicate&quot; (not &#x27;of America&#x27;), was eventually introduced. This Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version (revealed in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Justice League International Quarterly&quot; #8) was composed of Qwardians (residents of the antimatter counterpart of Oa) as well as being &quot;more powerful than their counterparts&quot;, they are shown to be different from the Earth-Three incarnation by their enlarged eyes, resembling the Weaponers of Qward. They acted as Claire Montgomery&#x27;s (Maxwell Lord&#x27;s ex-wife) second Conglomerate team.

=== Crime Syndicate of Amerika ===

Following a further &quot;soft&quot; reboot of DC continuity in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Zero Hour&quot; (1994) crossover, the Crime Syndicate was introduced once again, in 2000, in the &quot;&quot; graphic novel by Grant Morrison, which combined the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; parallel Earth idea with the Pre-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; antimatter universe concept. The Crime Syndicate&#x27;s Post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; antimatter Earth possesses a &quot;reversed&quot; history similar to Earth-Three&#x27;s, but with a much darker tone to both the team and its world. &quot;JLA Secret Files and Origins 2004&quot; provided additional history of this team, showing that even though they did partially resemble the Earth-Three Syndicate, they were still easily identifiable from their Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Three incarnation. Unlike the Crime Syndicate of Earth-Three, this Crime Syndicate of Amerika are able to rule their world (a change from their Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; counterparts, who were unsuccessful in conquering their world) though they allow governments to continue operating and honest people are able to continue operating in pockets such as Gotham City Police Commissioner Thomas Wayne Sr. (father to Owlman and counterpart of the murdered father of Batman).

Superman later encounters Ultraman, Superwoman and Owlman after a scared and out of control superpowered baby appears out of nowhere. Ultraman and Owlman come to believe the child is the offspring of Ultraman and Superwoman. Owlman wants to kill it out of jealousy, Ultraman wants to raise it as his demented protégé, and Superman tries to save it from them both. When Superwoman arrives on the scene, adamant that she has never given birth, it is revealed that the superpowered infant is actually a reborn Brainiac from the antimatter universe, defeated by Ultraman in the &quot;Earth-2&quot; story. Brainiac&#x27;s sentience is eventually dispersed and the villains return home to sort out their differences.
The Crime Syndicate reappear and lay waste to the planet Qward out of boredom. During their decimation of the planet, the entire Antimatter universe undergoes a reboot which causes some immediate changes, the most obvious of which is the sudden replacement of the white Power Ring with a black counterpart to John Stewart, the then-current Green Lantern in the JLA. In the story, it is explained that the reboot the Syndicate experiences is direct fallout from the events of 2003&#x27;s &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; crossover event. Not knowing of these events, the Crime Syndicate journey to the matter universe to attack Earth, blaming the JLA in the mistaken belief that the heroes are responsible for the changes that they have endured. It is during this time that they discover that the reboot of the antimatter universe wiped out the previous 24-hour rule, so the plan is changed to secretly take over the planet instead. Meanwhile, the defeated Qwardians rally behind a dimension-destroying weapon called the Void Hound and pursue the Syndicate to the matter universe, laying waste to hundreds of planets along the way. Reluctantly, the CSA teamed up with the JLA, but the Void Hound proved too powerful. The heroes finally defeated the Void Hound by using a former JLA foe, the Construct, to remove the artificial intelligence of the massive weapon and render it powerless. With the Void Hound defeated and the CSA owing the JLA a favor for saving them, the villains are sent back to the antimatter universe, where they discover to their horror that the Qwardians have also invaded their Earth, dismantling their entire criminal organization and freeing many imprisoned superheroes and rival supervillains.

The Crime Syndicate&#x27;s world is primarily governed by the &quot;favor bank&quot;, the only rule that is not consistently broken. If any person should grant a favor for someone else, that person is entitled to compensation whenever they see fit, no matter what the cost or hardship to the latter. Failure to pay back a favor results in inordinately harsh consequences, as seen in the beginning of &quot;Syndicate Rules&quot;. A mobster, Jackson &quot;Rat-Eyes&quot; Drake, who failed to follow up on a favor owed, was put on &quot;trial&quot; by Owlman, who then had him incinerated by Ultraman as a favor.

&quot;Superman/Batman&quot; Annual #1 (2006) details Superman and Batman&#x27;s first encounter with Ultraman and Owlman. Set years before Superman and Batman knew each other&#x27;s secret identities, a vacationing Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, and Lois Lane meet Ultraman, Owlman, and Superwoman when the villains appear on a cruise ship. This story also features the first appearance of Deathstroke&#x27;s unnamed antimatter doppelganger. The Ultraman, Owlman, and Superwoman presented in the story have the same costumes as the antimatter universe version of the Syndicate. This tale however is being told by Mister Mxyzptlk and, as such, may &quot;not&quot; actually be canonical.

After the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the original Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Ultraman appears in the bottle city of Kandor posing as Kal-El (Superman). It is also revealed that Saturn Queen, last seen in &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, survived the reboot of the universe in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and through flashbacks we learn that she has used her telepathic abilities to convince Ultraman that he is Kal-El and that she is his mother. His original personality seems intact, however, as he is portrayed as being as sadistic and self-centered as ever. Saturn Queen further manipulates events to place him in charge of Kandor and mind controls Kara Zor-El (Supergirl) into marrying him. Kara eventually breaks free and in a blind rage beats him to a pulp (at this point in time, Supergirl was portrayed as being slightly more powerful than Superman). Ultraman is saved when Saturn Queen provides information to Supergirl about her lost home of Argo City in exchange for sparing his life. From this point on, neither the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Ultraman nor Saturn Queen are seen again and their fates were unknown at the time the universe was rebooted again during 2011&#x27;s &quot;Flashpoint&quot;.

Meanwhile, the antimatter CSA made their next appearance in &quot;Trinity&quot;. Here, it is revealed that the Syndicate have gained control of their Earth again and have been abducting people from throughout all of the individual 52 universes in the current positive matter Multiverse to use as slave labor to repair their damaged Earth. After the hyper-powered Trinity heroes of the story defeat and imprison the Syndicate and free the slaves, the antimatter Earth falls into chaos.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #43, Doctor Impossible and his cohorts use extra-dimensional superhero the Blue Jay to open up a gateway to the Multiverse. Owlman, Ultraman, and Superwoman are briefly seen standing atop a building, with shadows obscuring most of their identifying marks, thus making it unclear which versions they are. The full Crime Syndicate members later appear with the original Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; iterations of Power Ring and Johnny Quick replacing their contemporary counterparts as a mirror to the events of &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; and &quot;&quot;. After arriving on New Earth following the destruction of their world at the hands of Alexander Luthor (who had built a weapon of mass destruction that detonated following his demise), the Syndicate attacks the Hall of Justice, where Luthor&#x27;s corpse was interred after his murder at the hands of Joker during the finale of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. It is revealed that the Syndicate members were working with Doctor Impossible in order to create a machine that could resurrect the dead, hoping that they could revive Luthor and force him to undo the damage he had dealt to the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s world. Just as the machine is to be activated, Doctor Impossible double-crosses the Syndicate and attempts to resurrect Darkseid rather than Luthor, but the machine malfunctions and instead creates an immensely powerful villain called the Omega Man.

In the ensuing storyline, Power Ring is killed and the members of the Justice League and the Crime Syndicate are forced to work together to stop the Omega Man. Realizing that the situation is hopeless, Owlman betrays the League and turns them over to the Omega Man, figuring that the Syndicate could take over the League&#x27;s Earth after the Omega Man kills off most of the heroes. At the last second, Batman reveals that he anticipated the Syndicate&#x27;s betrayal, and used the Tangent Universe&#x27;s version of Green Lantern to resurrect Luthor behind the Syndicate&#x27;s back. Though his resurrection is short-lived, Luthor builds a machine that ultimately sends the Syndicate back to their own ravaged world and seemingly destroys the Omega Man.

=== Crime Society ===
In &quot;52&quot; #52, an alternate version of Earth-Three is shown as a part of the new Multiverse. In the depiction are characters that are altered versions of the original Justice League of America, plus the Martian Manhunter. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear.

Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Three, making these new characters unrelated to previous versions. In &quot;Countdown&quot; #31, the name of this team is revealed to be the Crime Society. The Society are said to be evil doppelgangers of the heroes of Earth-2, and make their first solo appearance in &quot;Countdown Presents The Search for Ray Palmer - Crime Society&quot; #1 written by Sean McKeever and illustrated by Jamal Igle. In addition to the five known members, this version of the CSA includes evil versions of the Green Arrow, Wildcat, the Black Canary, Hawkwoman, Stargirl, and the Spectre. Later issues introduce Annataz Arataz (the counterpart of Zatanna), and counterparts of Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), Wonder Girl (Donna Troy), and Booster Gold.

Shortly after the Crime Society&#x27;s introduction, they are offered a place among the Monarch&#x27;s army. Already recruited into the Monarch&#x27;s army, Johnny Quick wins a place in the Monarch&#x27;s elite squad when he defeats his Earth-9 and Earth-2 counterparts in the &quot;&quot; miniseries. All of the Crime Society members who are present in the Earth-51 dimension at the end battle with Superman-Prime and the Monarch are killed, as the entire dimension is completely destroyed with only Superman-Prime and a single plant surviving the cataclysm. The original five members are not present at this battle, though their fates remain unknown.

=== &quot;The New 52&quot; ===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, with the changes of this new timeline, Crime Syndicate was introduced as the true antagonists of the &quot;Villains Month&quot; event, and the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; series.

At the conclusion of &quot;Trinity War&quot;, it is revealed that the leader of the Secret Society, previously known as &quot;the Outsider&quot;, was actually an Earth-3 version of Alfred Pennyworth. He gains possession of Pandora&#x27;s Box to open a portal to Earth-3, from which the Crime Syndicate emerges. The Crime Syndicate then proceeds to attack the fallen Justice League members and claims Prime Earth now belongs to them.

&quot;The New 52&quot; line-up of the Crime Syndicate consists of Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Johnny Quick, Power Ring, Deathstorm, Sea King (who does not survive the trip to Prime Earth) and two new members: Atomica, who had posed as the Atom while working as a mole for the Secret Society, and Grid, a sentient computer virus in a robot body made from Cyborg&#x27;s old prosthetic parts. The Sea King, however, awakens after his body is placed at the bottom of the ocean. After Power Ring fell in battle against Sinestro, Grid informs Ultraman and Superwoman about it at the time when they are looking for Batman&#x27;s kryptonite ring. Grid also informs them that the ring has released a pulse that was sensed throughout the Multiverse. Knowing the creature that destroyed their world has found them, Ultraman orders the Syndicate to regroup and heads to Maine with them. Batman, Lex Luthor and their team arrive at the fallen Watchtower and go in search of the kidnapped Dick Grayson (Nightwing) and the Crime Syndicate. Grid informs the Outsider of the intrusion and he goes to protect their hooded prisoner over Grayson, only for Black Manta to intercept the Outsider and kill him. Batman, Luthor, Catwoman and Bizarro enter the room with Grayson and see he has been placed in a &quot;Murder Machine&quot; originally intended for Doomsday. They realize that the machine is a detonator for a bomb that can only be stopped if Grayson&#x27;s heart stops. The remaining Crime Syndicate members return to the Watchtower and attack Sinestro, Deathstroke, and Black Adam. Johnny Quick and Atomica attack Captain Cold and Black Manta, who have unmasked the prisoner and removed the tape from his mouth. Captain Cold fires his cold gun on Johnny Quick&#x27;s leg and then breaks it off. Back with Grayson, Luthor prevents Batman from saving Grayson, choosing to save the group&#x27;s lives over Grayson&#x27;s. As Grayson dies, Batman attacks Luthor for murdering him with Luthor trying to reason with him that he has everything under control. With the hooded prisoner now free, he reveals himself as Alexander Luthor and yells &quot;Mazahs!&quot; to access the dark lightning. Alexander Luthor transforms into Mazahs and kills the injured Johnny Quick, taking his power. After the trapped superheroes are freed from the Firestorm Matrix, Superwoman reveals that the father of her child is actually Alexander Luthor. Mazahs destroy Deathstorm taking his powers as well as attacking Lex and Bizarro, where Mazahs defeats Bizarro. Mazahs is able to pin Lex, who says &quot;Mazahs!&quot;, summoning the dark lightning as he sounds like Alexander Luthor. Lex Luthor is able to defeat him once he is back to Alexander Luthor and then kills him. Ultraman begins attacking Lex. As he does, Black Adam and Sinestro move the Moon, causing Ultraman to be hit with the sun, weakening him. Atomica reappears from underneath the rubble, only for Lex Luthor to kill her by stepping on her. Lex Luthor rejoins the heroes and saves Superman by removing the kryptonite placed in his brain by Atomica. In the aftermath, Ultraman and Superwoman are captured, with Owlman still on the loose. It is later revealed that the entity that destroyed the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s world is the Anti-Monitor, who declares &quot;Darkseid shall be mine&quot;.

In the &quot;Darkseid War&quot; story in &quot;Justice League&quot;, Cyborg and Jessica Cruz, who has partially learned to harness Power Ring&#x27;s Ring of Volthoom, seek out Superwoman in her maximum security prison for guidance on how to deal with the Anti-Monitor, who has killed Darkseid and now threatens all of existence. Seizing the opportunity to reunite the Syndicate, Volthoom seizes control of Jessica&#x27;s body and when Cyborg attempts to interface with the ring, has the &quot;Grid&quot; personality re-uploaded and placed in control of his armor. As the trio plot to reunite with Ultraman, the heretofore-missing Owlman shows up and declares that the League and Syndicate must work together to stop the Anti-Monitor. At the climax of the story, Ultraman is incinerated by the Anti-Monitor, ignoring Superman&#x27;s warnings that it was too powerful to fight alone. Superwoman gives birth to her baby and is shortly thereafter killed by the Anti-Monitor. Having abandoned his comrades, Owlman indicates he never cared for the Syndicate, and his ultimate goal was to sit on Metron&#x27;s Chair, which would give him all knowledge in the multiverse. He strikes a bargain with Metron and sits in the chair, absorbing its secrets. Suddenly, he becomes aware of a presence but before he can react, he and Metron are seemingly vaporized by a blue light. With the deaths of the last remaining Syndicators, Superwoman&#x27;s child becomes the sole survivor of Earth 3, paralleling Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s survival after the first Crisis.

=== &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; ===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. During the &quot;Year of the Villain&quot; event, the Crime Syndicate is revealed to still be alive along with their universe restored after the events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;. They decide to align themselves with Perpetua in her conquest of the multiverse, secretly planning to take power for themselves. However, Owlman learns from John Stewart that there have been other versions of himself and thus he can never truly be erased as an Owlman will always exist in the multiverse. Upon this realization, Owlman betrays them and destroys his own world out of jealousy towards The Batman Who Laughs, and his belief that he will inevitably be reincarnated when the multiverse reforms.

=== &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; ===
Following the reboot of the Multiverse at the end of &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot; as seen during the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, a new Earth 3 is created with a new Crime Syndicate with a different origin like Superwoman being Donna Troy, Owlman still being Thomas Wayne Jr. whose parents were killed by a mugger named Harvey Bullock under orders from Boss Gordon who considered them rival crime lords, Ultraman being Kal-El who was exploited by Jonathan and Martha Kent, John Stewart being a former beat cop before becoming Emerald Knight, and Johnny Chambers is a criminal who was raised by a father who trained dogs for dog fighting. The Syndicate is brought together to fight off an invasion by the Starros, paralleling the original origin of the Justice League of America where they possessed characters like Black Siren, Doctor Chaos, Miss Martian, Red Beetle, and Sky Tyrant. The Starros claimed they were not invading but were seeking refuge from the Overlords of Oa, but were nevertheless killed by the Syndicate. Lex Luthor starts to put together a resistance against them called the Legion of Justice that include New God Lonar, her horse Thunderer, Power Tower, Red Hood (Earth 3&#x27;s Harley Quinn), Savanna, Sinestro, and Venus where their first mission results in the death of Johnny Quick before he can be recruited into the Crime Syndicate. The Legion of Justice were aided by Ultraman&#x27;s cousin Ultragirl in their fight against the Crime Syndicate of America. During the fight, Sinestro is killed by Emerald Knight, Atomica causes Ultragirl to die from a brain haemorrhage, and a badly-injured Lex Luthor is taken prisoner. One week after the battle, the remaining members of the Legion of Justice ally with Jester and the Crime Syndicate, setting up their base in the Legion of Justice&#x27;s former satellite base. The Crime Syndicate holds a press conference advising all metahumans to serve them or else. While Ultraman is upset over Atomica causing Ultragirl&#x27;s death, Atomica holds Emerald Knight accountable for Johnny&#x27;s death, and Emerald Knight criticizes Ultraman&#x27;s withdrawal weakness to Kryptonite and concern over Owlman&#x27;s duplicity.

Later, the Crime Syndicate comes into conflict with the Suicide Squad, culminating in the &quot;War for Earth-3&quot; storyline, which sees Owlman and Ultraman defeated, with Superwoman, Johnny Quick, and Emerald Knight (now the new Power Ring) now working for Amanda Waller, who converted the Crime Syndicate into a new Justice League alongside operatives in her squad.

==Members==
===Founding members===
The following five members founded the original Crime Syndicate of America and have appeared in all additional iterations of the team:

; Ultraman: The counterpart of Superman. Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the Earth-Three Ultraman came from a Krypton that had not exploded. This Ultraman also depended on kryptonite to maintain his superpowers rather than drain them (originally receiving a new power through each exposure to kryptonite). Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the antimatter Earth&#x27;s Ultraman was a human astronaut (Lieutenant Clark Kent) given Anti-Kryptonite-based superpowers after an encounter with aliens. If he is separated from anti-kryptonite long enough, his powers fade away; originally the antimatter Kent combats this power loss by inserting anti-kryptonite capsules under his skin which are released gradually over time, as shown in the &quot;JLA: Earth 2&quot; hardcover. Later books state that his increasing resistance level has made this process impractical and he wears the anti-kryptonite in the silver-colored containers along his costume. The antimatter Clark Kent has an unhealthy obsession with his universe&#x27;s Lois Lane, who is his Crime Syndicate teammate Superwoman, having forced her to marry him and bear him a son, who was later possessed by their version of Brainiac.

; Owlman: The counterpart of Batman. Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Owlman possessed a limited range of mind control powers. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Owlman&#x27;s origin was fleshed out, with his powers enhanced by a range of technological and physical skills much like Batman&#x27;s. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the antimatter Owlman is Thomas Wayne Jr., the older brother of his Earth&#x27;s Bruce Wayne, who was killed along with his mother. Wayne Jr. blames his father Police Commissioner Thomas Wayne Sr., which has since started a personal conflict between them to the point that Thomas Sr. is determined to kill his own son. Wayne Jr. also increased his IQ with a drug-enhancer for his cerebral cortex as stated in the &quot;JLA: Earth 2&quot; hardcover. Wayne Jr. openly possesses plans to counter his teammates&#x27; powers. Wayne Jr. uses these counterattacks whenever he chooses, as he causes Johnny Quick to have a minor heart attack at the beginning of the &quot;Syndicate Rules&quot; storyline. Wayne Jr. has had a number of illicit liaisons with Superwoman, though it is not clear whether this is a genuine attraction or just another way of showing her independence from the obsessively jealous and ever-watchful Ultraman.

; Superwoman: The counterpart of Wonder Woman. Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Superwoman gained her powers from being like her world&#x27;s Amazons, and thus has similar powers to Wonder Woman, the gray streak in her hair shows she is aging and thus abandoned Paradise Island earlier, and her black uniform sans bracelets explains why she seems unhinged, as in Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Amazon lore - an Amazon without bracelets is a berserker and stronger than an average Amazon. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, she is the antimatter Earth&#x27;s version of Wonder Woman as well and has either directly or indirectly killed all the Amazons native to her reality. Superwoman took the name of Lois Lane when she established herself in Patriarch&#x27;s World. Her birth name has not been revealed at present. Superwoman&#x27;s lasso does not compel others to tell the truth, but instead releases inhibitions and forces a victim to reveal secrets which they find especially humiliating. The post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superwoman also has heat vision and continues an open affair with Owlman, much to the anger of her husband Ultraman.

; Johnny Quick: The counterpart of the Flash. Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the criminal Earth-Three Quick was the counterpart of the Barry Allen Flash, though he was not as fast as Allen. He wore an enhancement helmet that augmented his above-human speed, but could not break the lightspeed or dimensional barriers on his own, even with the helmet&#x27;s augmentation. His specific birth name was never revealed in-panel. Each Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Johnny Quick maintains his superpowers with the use of &quot;Speed Juice&quot;, a powerful stimulant which was made from the blood of his murdered predecessor. The Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Quick&#x27;s predecessor was later resurrected, and was revealed to be the antimatter counterpart to the Golden Age Johnny Quick.

; Power Ring: The counterpart of Green Lantern. Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Power Ring gained his magical ring of power from a Tibetan monk named Volthoom, and has powers similar to the Silver Age Green Lantern. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the original Power Ring (who still got the ring from a Tibetan monk named Volthoom) was an American named Harrolds, but the &quot;&quot; hardcover established that the original Power Ring later gave the ring to a young blond man, the counterpart to Kyle Rayner. His ring was inhabited by the spirit of Volthoom, who often spoke on his own, making inane observations and taking up residence in the ring wielder&#x27;s mind; all of which is considered a curse to the ring&#x27;s wielder. The blond Power Ring&#x27;s favorite tactic in battle was to use the ring to create living Boschian monstrosities capable of destroying whole city blocks. The &quot;Syndicate Rules&quot; storyline showed that after the antimatter Universe was destroyed by Krona and recreated, certain elements of history had been changed, and now the second Power Ring was a counterpart to John Stewart. This Power Ring was a Slave Marine for many years and was tricked by Harrolds into taking the ring by telling him he was the chosen substitute to wield the ring when Harrolds could not.

===Qwardian line-up===
A team of Qwardians based on the then-current Justice League International roster appeared on the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;/Pre-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; Earth, although they did not call themselves the Crime Syndicate, even through their predecessors (Qwardian versions of the original Syndicate) did. Its members were:

* Deadeye – Green Arrow&#x27;s counterpart.
* Elasti-Man – Elongated Man&#x27;s counterpart.
* Element Man – Metamorpho&#x27;s counterpart.
* Fiero – Fire&#x27;s counterpart.
* Frostbite – Ice&#x27;s counterpart.

<text>Edith Cowan University (ECU) is a public research university in Western Australia. It is named in honour of the first woman to be elected to an Australian parliament, Edith Cowan, and, , still the only Australian university named after a woman. It is the second-largest university in the state with over 30,000 students in 2023. Gaining university status in 1991, it was formed from an amalgamation of tertiary colleges with a history dating back to 1902 when the Claremont Teachers College was established, making it the modern descendant of the first tertiary institution in Western Australia.

It offers study programs in healthcare, biomedicine, computer science, education, engineering, psychology, sports science, law, business, humanities, social sciences, aeronautics and the performing arts. It also offers a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) research program and various majors of study in commerce, the arts and sciences. The university has a partnership with the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, with which it offers dual-enrolled programs with integrated overseas study, and the University of Tasmania for naval engineering. ECU also has a notable cybersecurity research program being one of two universities operating federal Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence (ACCSE) and the only Australian member university in the InterNational Cyber Security Center of Excellence (INCS-CoE).

It has two metropolitan campuses in Perth (Joondalup and Mount Lawley) and a regional campus in Bunbury. The main Joondalup campus forms the flagship institution of the Joondalup Learning Precinct and features a pine park and pond in the university quadrangle. The Mount Lawley campus, which is home to its Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts among other schools, is The Bunbury campus is located in bushland adjacent to the St John of God Bunbury Hospital which is home to a diverse range of native wildlife including cockatoos, possums, quolls, kangaroos and wallabies.

The university has produced some of Australia&#x27;s most prominent figures in the performing arts, operates a large nursing school, has a long history of teacher education and has a significant presence in cybersecurity research. It is also notable for achieving the highest student satisfaction rate nationally among the 37 public universities that participate in the federal government&#x27;s QILT Student Experience Survey. It has retained the position annually from 2020 to the latest survey in 2022. As of the Good Universities Guide 2024, it is also one of two national universities to have maintained a 5-star student satisfaction rating for teaching quality for 17 consecutive years.

==History==
In 1847, the General Board of Education was established to oversee school development in the Swan River Colony. After becoming the Central Board of Education, it was superseded by the then-called Education Department in 1893, which classified schools, graded teachers, defined teachers&#x27; positions, implemented a salary scale for teachers, abolished school fees, provided for co-educational schools and made attendance compulsory for children between the ages of six and 14. At this time, the Education Department had &quot;external study&quot; for student teachers, where they taught in the classroom while studying for examinations set by the Department.

The origins of Edith Cowan University date back to 1902 with the establishment of the Claremont Teachers College, the first tertiary institution in Western Australia. Students could gain qualifications through studying at the College, which remained the only place one could do this until the 1950s when the Churchlands and Graylands colleges opened. The function of teacher education did not pass into the university sector until the 1980s. The former Claremont campus is on land between Goldsworthy, Princess and Bay Roads in the western Perth suburb of Claremont. It is a large two storey limestone building set in extensive grounds, with a distinctive square crenellated tower, and was entered in the Register of the National Estate in 1987.

Over time, other teacher training colleges were formed, including Graylands Teachers College (GTC) in 1955, the Western Australian Secondary Teachers College (WASTC) in 1967 that was renamed Nedlands College of Advanced Education (NCAE) on 1 January 1979, Mount Lawley Teachers College (MLTC) in 1970 and Churchlands Teachers College in 1972. The Graylands Teachers College in 1977 was recommended by the Commonwealth Government for closure at the end of 1979, to be merged into Churchlands, Mount Lawley and Claremont.

On 11 December 1981, the Claremont Teachers College, Nedlands College of Advanced Education, Mount Lawley College of Advanced Education and Churchlands College of Advanced Education amalgamated to form the Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE, or colloquially &quot;wacky&quot;), with campuses in Churchlands, Claremont, Mount Lawley and Nedlands. A new Bunbury campus started taking in students in 1986, and a new Joondalup campus in 1987. During the 1980s, Western Australia&#x27;s first nursing education program was also established.

The Claremont Teachers College&#x27;s last Director was Thomas Ryan (1924–2002), who completed his teacher training at the College and graduated in 1947. He was appointed Vice-Principal of the College in 1972, a position he held until his appointment as Director of the College in 1980.
In 1989, WACAE underwent an independent review led by the former University of Melbourne vice chancellor David Caro in the form of the Caro Committee, which included Roy Lourens who later became vice chancellor of Edith Cowan University. One of the earlier proposals in the late 1980s for the name of the institution was Perth University. WACAE was granted university status on 1 January 1991 and changed its name to Edith Cowan University after Edith Dircksey Cowan, the first woman to be elected to an Australian Parliament. , Edith Cowan University is the only Australian university named after a woman.

Cowan worked to raise funds for students to attend universities in other states, prior to a university being built in Western Australia, obtaining government support for her scheme. Her work in this area was acknowledged by naming Western Australia&#x27;s oldest tertiary education institution and newest university after her, as well as her image being added to the 1995 and 2018 designs (the polymer designs) of the Australian $50 note.
Cowan believed that education was the key to growth, change and improvement and her contribution to the development of Western Australian education was significant. She strove to achieve social justice and campaigned for the rights of women, children and families, for the poor, the poorly educated and the elderly. She promoted sex education in schools, migrant welfare, and the formation of infant health centres, and was instrumental in obtaining votes for women in Western Australia.

In 1991, the university purchased the house that Cowan, her husband and family had resided in for approximately 20 years. The house was reconstructed on the university&#x27;s Joondalup campus with the assistance of the West Coast College of TAFE, and re-opened in 1997. Edith Cowan House, Building 20 on the university&#x27;s Joondalup campus, currently plays host to the Peter Cowan Writers Centre.

The original Claremont building continued serving for 16 years as a campus of Edith Cowan University following that institution&#x27;s formation in 1989. The campus was then acquired by the University of Western Australia and became home to the Confucius Institute, University of Western Australia Press and, until 2021, Taylors College.

<doc id="706860" wikidata="Q2699996" url="?curid=706860" title="Waiting for Guffman">
<text>Waiting for Guffman is a 1996 American mockumentary comedy film written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, and directed by Guest. The film&#x27;s ensemble cast includes Guest, Levy, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban and Parker Posey.

The film&#x27;s title is a reference to Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. As in the other mockumentary films created by Guest, the majority of the dialogue was improvised (based on Guest and Levy&#x27;s story). Because the film is about the production of a stage musical, it contains several original musical numbers written by Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer.

==Plot==
In the small city of Blaine, Missouri, a few residents prepare to put on a community theater production led by eccentric director Corky St. Clair. The show, a musical chronicling the town&#x27;s history titled &quot;Red, White and Blaine&quot;, is to be performed as part of the town&#x27;s 150th-anniversary celebration.

Cast in the leads are Ron and Sheila Albertson, married travel agents who are also regular amateur performers; Libby Mae Brown, a perky Dairy Queen employee; Clifford Wooley, a &quot;long time Blaineian&quot; and retired taxidermist, who is &quot;Red, White and Blaine&quot;″s narrator; Johnny Savage, a handsome and oblivious mechanic, whom Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Dr. Allan Pearl, a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. High-school teacher Lloyd Miller is the show&#x27;s increasingly frustrated musical director.

Corky has used connections from his &quot;off-off-off-off-Broadway&quot; past to invite Mort Guffman, a Broadway producer, to critique &quot;Red, White and Blaine&quot;. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean their show might go all the way to Broadway.

The program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle Missouri from the Pacific coastline. The viewer also learns why the town obtusely refers to itself as &quot;the stool capital of the United States.&quot; The music is a series of poorly performed songs such as &quot;Nothing Ever Happens on Mars&quot;, a reference to the town&#x27;s supposed visit by an unidentified flying object, and &quot;Stool Boom&quot;.

Central to the film are Corky&#x27;s stereotypically gay mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no one in Blaine has ever met or seen. He uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women&#x27;s clothing and shoes.

When Johnny is forced by his suspicious father to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor, playing a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. Corky never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp, or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of stage rouge and eyeliner.

Corky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, at one point quitting the show after storming out of a meeting with the city council, which turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production, but the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return. At the show&#x27;s performance, Guffman&#x27;s seat is seen to be empty, much to the dismay of the cast. Corky reassures them that Broadway producers always arrive a bit late for the show, and sure enough, a man soon takes Guffman&#x27;s reserved seat. The show is well received by the audience, whereupon Corky invites the assumed Guffman backstage to talk to the actors.

The man is actually Roy Loomis, who has come to Blaine to witness the birth of his niece&#x27;s baby, but he did enjoy the show. Corky then reads a telegram stating that Guffman&#x27;s plane was grounded by snowstorms in New York City, meaning that, like the &quot;Godot&quot; being spoofed, the real Guffman never arrives.

An epilogue shows the fates of the cast: Libby Mae is now living in Sipes, Alabama, where she moved after her father was paroled, and working at the Dairy Queen. Allan and the Albertsons have pursued their dreams of being entertainers, Ron and Sheila traveling to Los Angeles, California, to work as extras, and Allan now performing for elderly Jews in Miami, Florida retirement communities. Corky has returned to New York City, where he has opened a Hollywood-themed novelty shop, which includes such items as Brat Pack bobblehead dolls, &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; action figures, and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; lunch boxes.

==Cast==
==Production==
The movie was shot in Lockhart, Texas, a town located 30 miles south of Austin. Christopher Guest wanted to put a &quot;Stool capital of the world&quot; sign up over the town, but he was not granted permission to do so. Additional shooting took place in Los Angeles, including the scenes set in Corky St. Clair&#x27;s apartment.

As in the other mockumentary films created by Guest, the majority of the dialogue is improvised. Matt Keeslar was the only cast member with no history of doing improvisational acting. Guest compares the process to jazz music: &quot;You know the basic melody and the key changes, but it&#x27;s how you get from one change to the next that matters, and you don&#x27;t know in advance how you&#x27;re going to do it. I&#x27;m completely blank before the camera rolls. I have absolutely no idea what I&#x27;m going to say.&quot; Guest shoots 10-minute-long scenes and allows improvisations to unfold organically. He ends up with almost 60 hours of film, and takes over a year to edit it down to about 90 minutes. A two-hour workprint version of &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; has circulated among fans, which includes some of the original footage that was edited out.

==Release and reception==
After being shown at the Toronto and Boston film festivals in late 1996, it received a US theatrical release, playing in roughly 50 theaters beginning on January 31, 1997. The only other country it received a theatrical release in was Australia, during September 1997. It had earlier been shown at the Melbourne International Film Festival on August 4, 1997.

To promote the film, Guest made appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and the NBC talk show &quot;Later&quot; during February 1997.

As of 2024, &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;This riotously deadpan mockumentary about aspiring community theater performers never stoops to ridicule oft-ridiculous characters.&quot; The film also received a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade A and called it &quot;A madcap gem.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;Priceless&quot;. It got two thumbs up on the February 1, 1997, episode of &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: &quot;Attention is paid not simply to funny characters and punch lines, but to small nudges at human nature.&quot; Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; called the film &quot;Frequently funny -- sometimes very funny indeed.&quot;
During opening weekend, the film made $37,990. The film earned $2.9 million at the US domestic box office, against a production budget of $4 million.

==Accolades and legacy==

In December 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; listed &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Best Movies of All Time&quot;, saying it was &quot;a comedy as touching as it is hilarious&quot; and &quot;one for the ages&quot; that became &quot;the ultimate cult film for a newly liberated generation&quot;.

Shortly after its release, in January 1998, &quot;SFGate&quot; listed it as one of the best films of the previous year, according to ratings by 40 major critics, including those of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The Lone Star Film &amp; Television Awards awarded &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; for Best Film and Best Director.

Independent Spirit Awards recognition: 
* Best Feature - Karen Murphy (nominated)

<text>Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight is a 1995 American black horror comedy film directed by Ernest Dickerson from a screenplay by Mark Bishop, Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris. It stars Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Brenda Bakke, C. C. H. Pounder, Dick Miller, and Thomas Haden Church.

&quot;Demon Knight&quot; is a feature-length film presented by the HBO series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, and features scenes with the Crypt Keeper (voiced by John Kassir, as in the series) at the film&#x27;s beginning and ending.

The film was met with mostly negative reviews. It was followed by a second standalone &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; (1996).

==Plot==
===Prologue===
The Crypt Keeper reveals that he is directing the film called &quot;Demon Knight&quot; and introducing the film&#x27;s story.

===Story===
On a desert road in New Mexico, a powerful demon in human form, The Collector, pursues drifter Frank Brayker. The vehicles crash and Brayker flees. Local drunk Uncle Willy takes him to a decommissioned church converted into a boarding house, where he rents a room and observes the residents: owner Irene, prostitute Cordelia, postal clerk Wally, and a convict on work release named Jeryline. A cook named Roach arrives and informs the group about a theft attempt on his employer&#x27;s car, unaware it was Brayker, and a suspicious Irene calls the sheriff. Sheriff Tupper and his deputy Bob encounter The Collector at the crash site, who convinces them that Brayker is a dangerous thief. At the boarding house, Tupper and Bob learn that Brayker is in possession of an important artifact and that he is carrying false ID. Tupper also gets word from his base that both cars were stolen and he arrests Brayker as well as The Collector. The Collector kills Tupper by punching through his skull. Driven outside by the key-like artifact Brayker possesses, The Collector draws his own blood on the sand and produces a team of demonic creatures.

Brayker uses blood from the artifact to protect the building and tells the group they must wait out the night. Unable to get in, The Collector uses psychic powers to seduce and possess Cordelia. Cordelia kills Wally and cripples Irene before Brayker kills her. The group attempts to escape through old mine tunnels under the building, where Jeryline finds a boy named Danny hiding. The other townsfolk, under demonic possession, drive them back into the church. The residents demand an explanation, and Brayker reluctantly tells them the history of the key artifact. Following the creation of Earth by God, demons used seven keys to focus the power of the cosmos into their hands. When discovered, God created light, which scattered the demons and the keys across the universe. The artifact that Brayker holds is the last key needed to reclaim power; to protect it, God had a thief named Sirach fill it with the blood of Jesus Christ. The guardians of the key, immortal while holding it, have since passed it on, refilling it with their own blood when they die. Brayker received the key from his commanding officer during World War I. Danny disappears and Jeryline rallies everyone to look for him, during which Roach sneaks the key out of Brayker&#x27;s satchel.

In the church attic, Irene and Bob discover that Wally was planning to attack the post office with a trunk full of weapons. The Collector soon possesses Uncle Willy, who attacks the others. While battling Willy, Roach makes a deal with The Collector to trade his life for the key, but The Collector betrays and kills him soon after Roach walks away. Brayker retrieves the key in the battle and Irene and Bob sacrifice themselves to stop the remaining minions. In the attic, The Collector brainwashes Danny, who mortally wounds Brayker before Jeryline kills him. As he dies, Brayker initiates Jeryline as a guardian of the key, deactivating all blood seals. The Collector overpowers Jeryline, taking the key from her. When he offers her a place at his side and prepares to take her heart as a trophy when she silently refuses, Jeryline confronts The Collector and spits blood from the key in his face, causing him to revert to his actual demon form before being destroyed.

At dawn, Jeryline refills the key with Brayker&#x27;s blood and boards a bus with her cat, sealing the door behind them. Down the road, the bus stops to pick up a stranger (Mark David Kennerly), who declines to get on stating that he&#x27;ll catch the next one. Dressed identically to his predecessor and carrying the same suitcase, Jeryline realizes that he is the next Collector. After exchanging a glance in passing, the new Collector begins following on foot, whistling the theme song to the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; television series.

===Epilogue===
After &quot;Demon Knight&quot; story ends, The Crypt Keeper states that Jeryline lived happily ever after. He goes to the film&#x27;s premiere screening, where he is beheaded by producers (as the punishment of asking for final cut privilege). After the beheading, The Crypt Keeper is still alive and he says that &quot;Now that&#x27;s entertainment!&quot;

==Production==
Unlike episodes of the HBO series, the story was not adapted from the pages of EC Comics. The first draft of the script was written in 1987, two years prior to the HBO series&#x27; debut. It was first intended to be made into a film by director Tom Holland, who planned to shoot it as a follow-up to &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988). Holland hired an FX team to do preliminary sketches, but he ultimately went on to direct the box-office bomb &quot;Fatal Beauty&quot; (1987).

Next, the script wound up in the hands of &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot; screenwriter Mark Carducci, who sat on it for several years before it was given to &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; director Mary Lambert. Lambert had some radical ideas for the script, including casting an African American as Brayker to create a theme that the oppressed people of Earth were also its saviors. Once Lambert went on to direct &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;, which was a theatrical bomb, she could not get people to invest in the film.

The script later went to Charles Band&#x27;s Full Moon Features, but budgetary constraints held up the production in limbo. When it finally made its way onto desks at Joel Silver&#x27;s Silver Pictures, it was optioned to be the second in a trilogy of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; theatrical spin-offs. Universal Pictures executives thought the script had more potential than the other two films (&quot;Dead Easy&quot; and &quot;Body Count&quot;, neither of which was ultimately produced), and the film was quickly sent into production with a tentative release date of Halloween 1994 (though the release was pushed back to January 1995).

At this point, two versions of the script were created to solve budgetary problems: one &quot;with&quot; demons and one &quot;without&quot;. In the latter, the Collector was a Bible salesman who was using a legion of fellow salesman clad in black suits and sunglasses (later revealed to be demons) as his minions. A film called &quot;Demon Knight&quot; with demons that looked like killer yuppies made everyone nervous, so Universal pitched in some additional money to get some demons on the screen.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 42% of 38 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.6/10. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it is &quot;neither funny enough nor scary enough to be fully satisfying as either a shocker or a spoof&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;the New York Times&quot; wrote that it half-succeeds at being chilling and funny. David Kronke of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a direct-to-video affair&quot; that was given a theatrical release based on the strength of the franchise. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it D+ and wrote: &quot;Is there anything more dispiriting than trash that flaunts its lack of conviction?&quot; Walter V. Addiego of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; called it &quot;a slime-and-gore fest that offers little but a few outrageous sick jokes and the chance to make a mental list of all the horror movies from which it borrows&quot;. Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that, though the film is dull and slow-paced, he was overall positive to the film. In a retrospective, Chris Eggertsen of Bloody Disgusting called it &quot;one of the most underrated genre entries of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

Later Ernest Dickerson said:&quot;I&#x27;ve always enjoyed &quot;Demon Knight&quot;. I love horror films, and I had a lot of fun creating a horror mythology. It was a great cast. I was also happy to do the first film where an African-American woman saves the world. That was a good project to be involved with&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack containing heavy metal, Hip-hop, industrial metal, glam metal, hardcore punk and alternative rock was released on January 10, 1995 by Atlantic Records. It peaked at 157 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Sequels==
In a post-credits scene, the Crypt Keeper announces a sequel titled &quot;Dead Easy&quot;: also known as &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;, it was intended to be a New Orleans zombie romp planned to open the following Halloween. A planned third film was given the title &quot;Body Count&quot;, but neither sequel was ever made. &quot;Demon Knight&quot; was intended to be the second film in the trilogy, but Universal thought it should go first because it was the most &quot;Tales&quot;-like feature out of the three proposed. The Key from &quot;Demon Knight&quot; was supposed to appear in every part of the trilogy; it later appeared in &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; (1996).

==Home media==
The film was originally released on LaserDisc in 1995 followed by its release on VHS and DVD in 1996 and 2003 respectively. It was also released as part of a double pack with &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; (1996), the following &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film. In October 2015, it was released on Blu-ray from Scream Factory which also retains the post-credits scene unlike some other home media releases and when it is broadcast on the Horror Channel.

<text>Tales from the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood is a 1996 American horror comedy film directed by Gilbert Adler from a screenplay by Adler and A.L. Katz, and a story by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis. Dennis Miller stars as Rafe Guttman, a private investigator hired by Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak) to investigate the disappearance of her brother Caleb (Corey Feldman) which leads him to a bordello run by Lilith (Angie Everhart).

The film was developed by Gale and Zemeckis in the 1970s after their college graduation. The duo conceived the original script as an exploitation film designed to break the duo into the film industry, but it went unproduced. The concept was subsequently revisited to serve as the second film in a proposed &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film trilogy greenlit by Universal Pictures following the success of the first film spinoff of the HBO series, &quot;Demon Knight&quot; (1995). Miller and Everhart were suggested for the cast by executive producer Joel Silver, though Adler and Katz wanted other actors to play the parts.

Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where the production was troubled by limited night time and continuity issues due to Miller&#x27;s constant improvisation and refusal to show up on set. Released in North America on August 16, 1996, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; was produced for $2.5 million, and it grossed $5.6 million. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and fans of the series. According to Everhart, it has become a cult film.

==Plot==
===Cold opening===
A group of treasure hunters led by Vincent Prather explore a forest, encountering a cave containing the coffin of Lilith, mother of all vampires. Vincent takes out a box containing the four sections of her heart and inserts it in her body, reviving her. Lilith awakens and kills the other treasure hunters, but Vincent subdues her with the key from &quot;Demon Knight&quot;.

===Crypt Keeper&#x27;s Prologue===
The Crypt Keeper is having lunch with the Mummy, who is boring him about film industry life. The Mummy challenges the Crypt Keeper to a contest of rock, paper, scissors which the Mummy wins, and he slices off the Keeper&#x27;s hand with a meat cleaver similar to what happened in &quot;The Assassin&quot; episode of the TV series. The Crypt Keeper laughs (as it didn&#x27;t hurt him at all) and the Mummy gets ready for the next round. The Crypt Keeper addresses the audience, and the movie continues.

===Story===
After fighting with his sister Katherine, Caleb Verdoux goes to a dive bar, where an odd man named Jenkins tells him of a brothel hidden in a funeral home. Caleb and his friend Reggie visit the address, where they are forced at gunpoint by mortician McCutcheon to climb into a coffin and sent through a furnace with a secret trap door leading to said brothel, unaware the prostitutes are all vampires led by Lilith. A prostitute named Tallulah seduces Reggie, whom Lilith kills before vampirizing Caleb.

When the police fail to find Caleb, Katherine reluctantly hires cynical and sarcastic private investigator Rafe Guttman, who tracks Caleb&#x27;s trail to the bar, where Caleb&#x27;s friends direct him to the funeral home. After a tip from Jenkins, Rafe revisits the funeral home that night. Initially, it appears as just a funeral home. Rafe overhears Lilith interview a woman, Tamara, followed by Tamara&#x27;s scream and a body hitting the floor. He finds Caleb&#x27;s nose ring and escapes. The next day he takes it to Katherine and tells her he&#x27;s going to stake out the funeral home that evening. Unbeknownst to Rafe, the funeral home conceals a corrupt organization run by Reverend J.C. Current.

Rafe is admitted into the brothel and approached by the now-vampirized Tamara, whom he tricks into letting him strap her to a torture rack so he can investigate further, finding Jenkins decapitated in a coffin. While fleeing, Rafe drops his wallet, allowing Lilith to find his address. Having tasted Rafe&#x27;s blood, Lilith takes an interest and tries to seduce him. When Katherine arrives, Rafe follows and describes the brothel&#x27;s activity to her. They alert the police, who dismiss Rafe as a fraud due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Vincent destroys the key, freeing Lilith.

As Katherine reviews footage where she confronted Lilith, she notices Lilith is not in the shot. Realizing that Rafe might be right, she calls him over. Caleb calls for help, asking them to meet him at the power plant. Upon arrival, they discover the vampirized Caleb and flee, but Rafe falls out a window, landing on the police chief&#x27;s car. The vampires catch Katherine and return her to the brothel.

Awakening in a hospital, Rafe is nearly killed by Tamara, who is posing as a nurse, but exposes her to sunlight, killing her. Katherine awakens and begs Caleb to free her, who refuses, too ingrained as Lilith&#x27;s servant and having fully embraced his newfound vampiric lifestyle. Lilith prepares to feed on Katherine while Caleb watches. Rafe loads up on Super Soakers filled with holy water and raids the brothel, killing Vincent and McCutcheon. He meets up with Current, who, having realized his error and attempting to rectify it, has brought stakes and mallets to kill the vampires. Current tells Rafe that Lilith&#x27;s heart must be removed from her body and quartered, as before she was found. Rafe gives him a spare water gun and the two enter the brothel and spray the vampires, including Caleb and Tallulah, who burn and explode.

They find Lilith, who mortally wounds Current and flees after Rafe attacks her with an axe. Rafe finds Katherine, and they head to Current&#x27;s church to reveal the existence of vampires with its media equipment. Lilith returns, handcuffs Rafe to a railing, and attacks Katherine. Rafe uses a nearby laser to hit Lilith in the heart, quartering it. However, as the pieces remain in her body, Lilith remains alive. As Lilith devolves into a hideous form (her true form) and attacks Rafe, Katherine grabs a candle stand and stabs out Lilith&#x27;s heart. After Lilith&#x27;s body burns and collapses to the ground, the two consecrate her remains with the help of Rabbi Goldman and lock away the box with the heart pieces.

Later, in his car, Rafe fondles Katherine, which she seems oddly more accepting of now, having been disgusted by him earlier. He notices the scent she&#x27;s wearing. She remarks, &quot;It&#x27;s not perfume. It&#x27;s sunblock.&quot; When he pulls back her skirt, he notices bite-marks on her thigh, indicating that Katherine had been vampirized by Lilith while hostage. She then flashes her fangs and bites Rafe in the neck.

===Epilogue===
The Crypt Keeper jokes that if Rafe and Katherine got married, she&#x27;d know &quot;what&#x27;s eating him... She is!&quot;. He has also apparently bested the Mummy at the game and reduced him to nothing but a head. The Crypt Keeper tells him to &quot;quit while he&#x27;s &#x27;a head&#x27;&quot; before laughing.

==Development==
After graduating from USC in 1973, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis wrote an early draft of &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot;, wanting to break into the film industry by making an exploitation film about &quot;a whorehouse full of vampires&quot;. They pitched &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; to producer John Milius in the 1970s, but ultimately was not produced at that time, and the three wound up making &quot;1941&quot; instead, but Milius described the scripts for &quot;Bordello&quot; and another proposed film from the duo entitled &quot;Tank&quot; as being &quot;pretty darn good&quot;.

Following the commercial success of the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film &quot;Demon Knight&quot; (1995), Universal Pictures greenlit two more &quot;Tales&quot; films, planning to make a film trilogy. The original proposed second film was &quot;Dead Easy&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;), a zombie film set in New Orleans, which was shut down during pre-production by Universal. The producers also considered Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s screenplay &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; as a possible &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film, as well as Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Frighteners&quot;. During this development process, Robert Zemeckis was offered a contract with DreamWorks, and considered leaving Universal. To appease him into staying with the studio, it was agreed that a revised &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; be produced as the second &quot;Tales&quot; film.

==Production==

The production budget was $2.5 million. Gilbert Adler was hired to direct, having previously been a showrunner for &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. Adler and A.L. Katz rewrote Gale and Zemeckis&#x27; script to make the film more modern. Corey Feldman, who was friends with executive producer Richard Donner and had previously acted in an episode of &quot;Tales&quot;, was cast in the film as Caleb. Adler and Katz wanted Daniel Baldwin to play Rafe Guttman, Bridgette Wilson to play Katherine and Robin Givens to play Lilith. Executive producer Joel Silver, however, wanted Dennis Miller to play Rafe, and Angie Everhart to play Lilith. Silver had recently produced a movie with a supermodel in a leading role, and while Everhart, whose only previous performance was a minor role in &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, was not a trained actress, Silver thought &quot;supermodel actresses&quot; was &quot;the next big thing&quot;. Everhart was introduced to Silver by Sylvester Stallone, who suggested her for the part of Lilith. Miller, who did not want to make the film, said he would play the lead for $1 million, but Universal refused to put up this salary for Miller, so Silver cut $750,000 from the special effects budget to hire Miller.

The movie was filmed in Vancouver because of Silver&#x27;s past union disputes, and Katz described the Canadian production crew as being inexperienced. In addition, Vancouver&#x27;s limited night hours in July and August caused problems trying to film night scenes. Miller disliked his character&#x27;s scripted dialogue and once he started filming, he proceeded to improvise nearly all of his dialogue. The &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; shoot was rescheduled to work around the shooting of &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot;, and the Canadian crew became angry at Miller because the filming schedule prevented their seeing their families on the weekends. On some days, Miller&#x27;s assistant told the production that he was too tired to show up, which meant that some of Miller&#x27;s scenes had to be shot without him with the script supervisor standing in for Miller. The cast became angry at Miller, and the script supervisor sometimes did not remember all of Miller&#x27;s improvised dialogue, which led to continuity problems.

According to Katz, after filming began, Erika Eleniak&#x27;s manager told the production that she would not travel to the set unless significant portions of the script that she found unacceptable were rewritten. Eleniak had left &quot;Baywatch&quot; because she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress, and allegedly did not want to play the character of Katherine as previously written. Katz claimed Katherine was scripted as being a stripper, and Adler and Katz frantically rewrote the script and changed these aspects of the character so she would travel to the set. However, Eleniak disputes this claim, saying that her argument with the producers was due to Joel Silver wanting to add a &quot;sexy&quot; scene between her and Everhart which had not been in the script, and that changes had been made to the script based on Eleniak&#x27;s casting to make her character &quot;sexier&quot;. Eleniak expressed disappointment that due to rewrites, the backstory of Katherine having a past as a 300lb ex-porn star named Chubbie O&#x27;Toole was removed from the film. Eleniak recalled later that she wore special makeup effects that were created for a brief scene in which Katherine discovers a Chubbie O&#x27;Toole poster in Rafe&#x27;s office.

==Soundtrack==


The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was released on August 7, 1996. It focused predominately on heavy metal and glam music by artists such as Anthrax, Red Kross, Kerbdog, Sweet, Scorpions and Cinderella. It received a score of two out of five stars from Allmusic.

==Release==
In a televised appearance prior to the film&#x27;s release, Dennis Miller told viewers not to see &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot;. &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; grossed $5.6 million. Upon release, the film was generally disliked by fans of the TV series, but later it developed a fanbase and is now considered a cult film. While the third film in the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film trilogy was never produced, &quot;Ritual&quot; (2002) is considered an unofficial entry in the &quot;Tales&quot; series.

In October 2015, Shout! Factory subsidiary Scream Factory released a special edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD. On July 16, 2016, the film was given a special 20th anniversary screening at the Canadian Rio Theatre in Vancouver, BC, attended by Adler and special effects artist Todd Masters. John Kassir also participated via Skype.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, the film was poorly received by critics. Leonard Maltin gave the film two stars, calling it a &quot;fitfully amusing juvenile horror comedy&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reviewer Mark Caro wrote: &quot;The &quot;Crypt&quot; tradition is ghoulish irreverence, but here it seems merely a hip excuse to stoop low&quot;. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; wrote: &quot;For a horror-comedy film to work, it&#x27;s got to be both funny and scary. &quot;Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood&quot; is neither. Instead, it&#x27;s only a bath of blood and bare skin, with some lame wisecracks thrown in for bad measure&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Richard Harrington said: &quot;Triple the length of its cable television inspiration, &quot;Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood&quot; is triple the gore, triple the naked women, but not, alas, triple the fun&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film, writing, &quot;another cheesy goulash of smart-alecky humor and full-bore gore, spiced with more shots of topless lovelies than you&#x27;d find in a &#x27;60s sexploitation flick. Adolescent boys might groove to the mix, but most other ticketbuyers will avoid this tawdry opus like the plague&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film 1 out of 5 stars: &quot;Miller is the best thing about the film, but a little of him goes a long way, and he&#x27;s on screen a lot. [...] This is a travesty, and if &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; publisher Bill Gaines isn&#x27;t spinning in his grave, it can only be because someone&#x27;s already put a stake through his heart&quot;. Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; ... easily could have been called &#x27;Bore-dello of Blood&#x27;. This gory vampire spoof is remarkably free of jolts, hardly registering as a fright film, with a series of weak special effects involving many globs of guts&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Lawrence Gelder wrote: &quot;Vampires aren&#x27;t the only things in &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; that can&#x27;t stand up to daylight. Neither can the plot&quot;. &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; critic Marc Savlov gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;&quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;... with nekkid vampire-vixens&quot;. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; writer Robert Bell gave the film 4 out of 10: &quot;&quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; was known for its twist endings, morality parables and askew sensibility; this feature shared none of those traits, and wouldn&#x27;t be recognizable as a part of the series without the presence of the Cryptkeeper bookending the film&quot;. Dread Central gave the film a score of 2 out of 5: &quot;If you told me the screenwriters dug through Miller&#x27;s trash and inserted his discarded one-liners into the script, I would have no problem believing it. Not a single one of his lines works, and every time he opens his mouth it only further reinforces the fact he was so very, very wrong for this role&quot;. Allmovie also gave the film a score of two stars out of five: &quot;Even with its obligatory Crypt Keeper bookends, the 87-minute &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; seems as inflated as the many surgically enhanced breasts on display&quot;.

However, not all reviews were negative. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Jack Matthews gave the film a favorable review, calling it a &quot;bloody good vehicle for Dennis Miller&quot;, writing: &quot;What it lacks in irony and suspense, Gilbert Adler&#x27;s &quot;Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood&quot; makes up for in whimsy and cheeky self-assurance. [...] This is the version of &quot;Dracula&quot; that Bram Stoker would have written with the collaboration of Mel Brooks and the Marquis de Sade over drinks at Hooters&quot;. Arrow in the Head also reviewed the film favorably, giving it a score of 6 out of 10, writing that &quot;this second entry in the &quot;Tales From The Crypt&quot; big screen series doesn&#x27;t fully measure up to its predecessor, but sill manages to deliver a mindless fun ride&quot;. ComingSoon.net wrote that &quot;&quot;Bordello&quot; is in many ways a superior &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; entry. Adler had previously directed episodes of the show and the film feels like an amplified episode, brightly lit, garish and tricked out with even more sleaze, sex, blood and general luridness&quot;. The Digital Bits wrote: &quot;Despite itself, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; is a fun movie. It&#x27;s not the best in the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; series, but it&#x27;s miles above [&quot;Ritual&quot;]. [...] Sure there are plenty of eye-rolling moments, [...] but it&#x27;s worth a couple of watches... especially to see William Sadler as a mummy&quot;.

The film holds a 14% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, and the average rating is 3.7/10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; is not as scary or funny as it thinks it is (or should&#x27;ve been), and all of Dennis Miller&#x27;s lines sound like castoffs from his stand-up material&quot;.

In a 2015 interview, Bob Gale, who had co-written the original screenplay with Robert Zemeckis, had said this about the film: &quot;&quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; was the first thing that Bob and I ever collaborated on, even before we got out of film school. The movie that was made is so different than the movie that we conceived of, I&#x27;ll tell you flat out I&#x27;ve never even seen the final version of it because the early cut of it I saw, I was so appalled by it that I just said, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll just leave that one to everybody else&quot;.

<doc id="706865" wikidata="Q14709151" url="?curid=706865" title="Oaks Amusement Park">
<text>Oaks Park is a small amusement park located south of downtown Portland, Oregon, United States. Opened in May 1905, it is one of the oldest continually operating amusement parks in the country.

The park includes midway games, about two dozen rides that operate seasonally, a skating rink that is open all year, and picnic grounds. It is also home to the Herschell–Spillman Noah&#x27;s Ark Carousel, a historic wooden carousel built in 1912.
==History==
The park, conceived as an attraction timed to accompany the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, was built by the Oregon Water Power and Railway Company and opened on May 30, 1905, during a period when trolley parks were often constructed along streetcar lines. It attracted 300,000 visitors during its first season, and continued to attract about that many patrons throughout its first decade of existence. Describing the moral panic of working-class entertainment venues opened at the time, a city council member described Oaks Park as &quot;an immoral place&quot; with &quot;more drunkenness there than he had seen at any place in the City&quot;.

In the early 1920s, the park was sold to John Cordray, one of its managers. After Cordray died in 1925, Edward Bollinger, Oaks Park&#x27;s superintendent, bought all but the land from Cordray&#x27;s widow; Bollinger acquired the land in 1943. Some of the park&#x27;s earliest rides included Chute the Chutes, a chute ride that whisked the riders down a steep incline plunging into a small man-made lake; the Barrel of Fun, a funhouse which included screaming skeletons, mazes of mirrors, and dark dead-end hallways; and the Mystic River Ride, a boat ride that traveled through darkened tunnels. The park also featured a floating bathhouse anchored along the river at the south end of the park, as well as a dance pavilion, which attracted famous acts from around the world, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the John Philip Sousa Marching Band, and Patrick Conway and his Band.

In 1948, the Vanport flood submerged Oaks Park for thirty days, killing a third of the bluff&#x27;s oak trees, warping most of the rides, and resulting in damage to the rink that took five months to repair; the next year, Bollinger&#x27;s son Robert took over after his father&#x27;s death. The damage prompted the owners to rebuild the rink floor on airtight iron barrels, which would float in the event of another flood; the floats worked as planned during the area&#x27;s Christmas flood of 1964 and the Willamette Valley Flood of 1996.

For many years, three steam locomotives and other historic rail equipment were kept near the amusement park on City of Portland owned park land (called Oaks Pioneer Park), on static display. These included Southern Pacific 4449, from 1958 to 1974; Spokane, Portland and Seattle 700, from 1958 to 1986; and Oregon Railroad &amp; Navigation Co. 197, from 1958 to 1996. Although no longer at Portland&#x27;s Oaks Pioneer Park (renamed in 1988 to Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge), the three locomotives all remain in Portland, and since 2012 they are residing at the Oregon Rail Heritage Center. Two years after the Jantzen Beach Amusement Park closed in 1970, the &quot;Oregon Journal&quot; reported Oaks Park &quot;may be on the verge of a renaissance&quot;; three years later Sellwood&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;The Bee&quot;, reported &quot;30,000 people a month still come during the summer.&quot;

In 1985, Robert Bollinger donated Oaks Amusement Park to the 501(c)(3) non-profit Oaks Park Association, which continues to operate the park to this day. The mission of the Oaks Park Association is &quot;the preservation and perpetuation of the historic amusement park as an affordable, safe, and family-friendly recreation attraction open to the general public.&quot;

The park gained recognition for its appearance in &quot;Free Willy&quot;. Many of the current and former attractions like Screamin&#x27; Eagle appeared in the movie as do the trailer Randolph reside while the roller skating rink served as the entrance to the aquatic theater where Willy was held captive in a tank which was actually shot at Six Flags México (formerly Reino Aventura) in Mexico.

The park celebrated 100 years of continuous operation in 2005, making it among the oldest in the U.S.

In 2024, the AtmosFear ride got stuck at the top with a full load of riders during a school field trip. It, and its riders, were stuck for around 20 minutes.

==Attractions==
===Current attractions===

Park rides and midway games are open weekends during spring and daily during summer. Rides include the following:

===Roller coasters===
====South End====
====East End====

====North End====

*Chipper&#x27;s Woods Miniature Golf (new for 2011)

===Roller skating rink===

The park includes a wooden roller skating rink, open year-round. The rink has had a pipe organ for most of its history; since 1955 it has been a Wurlitzer model with four manuals, moved to the rink from its previous home at Portland&#x27;s Broadway Theatre, where it had been installed in 1926. All pipework for the organ is mounted on a platform hanging over the skate floor.

<doc id="706877" wikidata="Q707787" url="?curid=706877" title="Robert Filmer">
<text>Sir Robert Filmer (c. 1588 – 26 May 1653) was an English political theorist who defended the divine right of kings. His best known work, &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, published posthumously in 1680, was the target of numerous Whig attempts at rebuttal, including Algernon Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;, James Tyrrell&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha Non Monarcha&quot; and John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;. Filmer also wrote critiques of Thomas Hobbes, John Milton, Hugo Grotius and Aristotle.

==Life==

The eldest child of Sir Edward Filmer and Elizabeth Filmer (née Argall) of East Sutton in Kent, he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1604. He did not take a degree and was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 24 January 1605. He was called to the bar in 1613, but there is no evidence he practised law. He bought the porter&#x27;s lodge at Westminster Abbey for use as his town house. On 8 August 1618, he married Anne Heton in St Leonard&#x27;s Church in London, with their first child baptised in February 1620. On 24 January 1619, King James I knighted Filmer at Newmarket.

Filmer&#x27;s father died in November 1629 and Filmer, as the oldest child, took over his father&#x27;s manor house and estate. He became a Justice of the Peace and an officer of the county militia in the 1630s. Filmer&#x27;s eldest son Sir Edward was active in opposing the Long Parliament and Filmer stood surety for £5000 for the release of his friend Sir Roger Twysden, who had been imprisoned for his part in the Kentish petition. The Parliamentary army looted his manor house in September 1642. By the next year his properties in Westminster and Kent were being heavily taxed to fund the Parliamentary cause. Filmer was investigated by the county committee on suspicion of supporting the King, though no firm evidence was uncovered. Filmer asked the investigators to note &quot;how far he hath binn from medling on either side in deeds or so much as words.&quot; One of his tenants claimed that Filmer had hidden arms for the Royalists, although this was apparently a false charge. Perhaps for that reason, Filmer was imprisoned for some years in Leeds Castle and his estates were sequestered.

Filmer died on or about 26 May 1653. His funeral took place in East Sutton on 30 May, where he was buried in the church, surrounded by descendants of his to the tenth generation. He was survived by his wife, three sons and one daughter, one son and one daughter having predeceased him.

His son, also Robert, was created the first of the Filmer baronets in 1674. His other son, Beversham Filmer, became the owner of Luddenham Court, near Faversham, who then passed it on through his family.

==&quot;Patriarcha&quot; and other works==

Filmer was already middle-aged when the controversy between the King and the House of Commons roused him to literary activity. His writings provide examples of the doctrines held by the extreme section of the Divine Right party.

The fullest expression of Filmer&#x27;s thoughts is found in &quot;Patriarcha, or the Natural Power of Kings&quot;, published posthumously in 1680, but probably begun in the 1620s and almost certainly completed before the Civil War began in 1642. According to Christopher Hill, &quot;The whole argument of ... &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, and of his works published earlier in the 1640s and 1650s, is based on Old Testament history from &quot;Genesis&quot; onwards&quot;.

His position was enunciated by the works which he published in his lifetime. &quot;Of the Blasphemie against the Holy Ghost&quot;, from 1646 or 1647, argued against Calvinists, starting from John Calvin&#x27;s doctrine on blasphemy. &quot;The Freeholders Grand Inquest&quot; (1648) concerned English constitutional history. Filmer&#x27;s early published works did not receive much attention, while &quot;Patriarcha&quot; circulated only in manuscript. &quot;Anarchy of a Limited and Mixed Monarchy&quot; (1648) was an attack on &quot;A Treatise of Monarchy&quot; by Philip Hunton, who had maintained that the king&#x27;s prerogative was not superior to the authority of the Houses of Parliament.

Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Observations concerning the Original of Government upon Mr Hobbes&#x27;s Leviathan, Mr Milton against Salmasius, and H. Grotius&#x27; De jure belli ac pacis&quot; appeared in 1652. In line with its title, it attacks several political classics, the &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; of Grotius, the &quot;Defensio pro Populo Anglicano&quot; of John Milton, and the &quot;Leviathan&quot; of Thomas Hobbes. The pamphlet entitled &quot;The Power of Kings, and in particular, of the King of England&quot; (written 1648) was first published in 1680.

==Views==
Filmer&#x27;s theory is founded upon the statement that the government of a family by the father is the true origin and model of all government. In the beginning God gave authority to Adam, who had complete control over his descendants, even over life and death itself. From Adam this authority was inherited by Noah. This assumes that from Shem, Ham and Japheth the patriarchs inherited the absolute power which they exercised over their families and servants, and that it is from these patriarchs that all kings and governors (whether a single monarch or a governing assembly) derive their authority, which is therefore absolute, and founded on divine right.
The difficulty inherent in judging the validity of claims to power by men who claim to be acting upon the &quot;secret&quot; will of God was disregarded by Filmer, who held that it altered in no way the nature of such power, based on the natural right of a supreme father to hold sway. The king is perfectly free from all human control. He cannot be bound by the acts of his predecessors, for which he is not responsible; nor by his own, for it is impossible that a man should give a law to himself – a law must be imposed by another upon the person bound by it.

As for the English constitution, he asserted in his &quot;Freeholders Grand Inquest touching our Sovereign Lord the King and his Parliament&quot; (1648) that the Lords give counsel only to the king, that the Commons are to perform and consent only to the ordinances of Parliament, and that the king alone is the maker of laws, which derive their power purely from his will. Filmer considered it monstrous that the people should judge or depose their king, for they would then become judges in their own cause.

Filmer was a severe critic of democracy. In his opinion, democracy of ancient Athens was in fact a &quot;justice-trading system&quot;. Athenians, he claimed, never knew real justice, only the will of the mob. Ancient Rome was, according to Filmer, ruled fairly only after the Empire was established.

==Reception==
Filmer&#x27;s theory obtained wide recognition owing to a timely posthumous publication. Nine years after the publication of &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, at the time of the Revolution which banished the Stuarts from the throne, John Locke singled out Filmer among the advocates of Divine Right and attacked him expressly in the first part of the &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;. The first &quot;Treatise&quot; goes into all his arguments seriatim, and especially points out that even if the first principles of his argument are to be taken for granted, the rights of the eldest born have been so often cast aside that modern kings can claim no such inheritance of authority, as Filmer asserts.

Filmer&#x27;s patriarchal monarchism was also the target of Algernon Sidney in his &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; and of James Tyrrell in his &quot;Patriarcha non-monarcha&quot;.

John Kenyon, in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, claimed that &quot;any unbiased study of the position shows in fact that it was Filmer, not Hobbes, Locke or Sidney, who was the most influential thinker of the age... Filmer&#x27;s influence can be measured by the fact that both Locke ... and Sidney ... were not so much [making] independent and positive contributions to political thought as elaborate refutations of his &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, written soon after its first publication. Indeed, but for him it is doubtful whether either book would have been written.&quot;

During the reign of Queen Anne Filmer&#x27;s works enjoyed a revival. In 1705 the non-juror Charles Leslie devoted twelve successive issues of the weekly &quot;Rehearsal&quot; to explaining Filmer&#x27;s doctrines and published them in a volume.

In an unpublished manuscript, Jeremy Bentham wrote:
Filmer&#x27;s origin of government is exemplified everywhere: Locke&#x27;s scheme of government has not ever, to the knowledge of any body, been exemplified any where. In every family there is government, in every family there is subjection, and subjection of the most absolute kind: the father, sovereign, the mother and the young, subjects. According to Locke&#x27;s scheme, men knew nothing at all of governments till they met together to make one. Locke has speculated so deeply, and reasoned so ingeniously, as to have forgot that he was not of age when he came into the world... Under the authority of the father, and his assistant and prime-minister the mother, every human creature is enured to subjection, is trained up into a habit of subjection. But, the habit once formed, nothing is easier than to transfer it from one object to another. Without the previous establishment of domestic government, blood only, and probably a long course of it, could have formed political government.

Bentham went on to claim that Filmer had failed to prove divine right theory but he had proved &quot;the physical impossibility of the system of absolute equality and independence, by showing that subjection and not independence is the natural state of man&quot;.

==Family==
His first son Sir Edward was Gentleman of the Privy Chamber. He died in 1668 and the East Sutton estate passed to his brother Robert who was created a baronet in 1674 in honour of their father&#x27;s loyalty to the Crown. See Filmer baronets. Filmer&#x27;s third son, Samuel, married Mary Horsmanden and lived in Virginia Colony before dying childless soon after.

<text>The Last Boy Scout is a 1991 American buddy action film directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Shane Black, and produced by Joel Silver. It stars Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans, with Noble Willingham, Chelsea Field, Taylor Negron, Danielle Harris, and Halle Berry. The film follows a washed-up private investigator (Willis) who teams up with a scandalized former football star (Wayans) to uncover a political conspiracy involving their former employers.

The film was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on December 13, 1991, to mixed reviews and a smaller than expected box office. Retrospective reviews have been more positive, and the film has developed a cult following.

== Plot ==
During halftime at a football game, Los Angeles Stallions running back Billy Cole receives a call from Milo, a man who warns him to win the game or he will be killed. Cole ingests PCP and in a drug-induced rage, brings a gun onto the field, shooting three opposing players to reach the end zone before shooting himself in the head. Meanwhile, private investigator Joe Hallenbeck, a disgraced former Secret Service agent who was once a national hero for saving the President from an assassination attempt, discovers that his wife Sarah is having an affair with his best friend and business partner, Mike Matthews. Before this, Mike gave Joe an assignment to act as bodyguard for a stripper named Cory. Mike is then killed by a car bomb outside Joe&#x27;s house.

That night at a strip club, Joe is approached by Cory&#x27;s boyfriend, former Stallions quarterback Jimmy Dix, who was banned from the league on gambling charges and alleged drug abuse. While Cory and Jimmy exchange conversations, Joe waits outside and is eventually knocked out by a team of hitmen. Jimmy and Cory leave the bar in separate cars while Joe overpowers the hitman left to dispatch him. When Cory is struck from behind and stops to confront the other driver, she is killed by the hitmen. Jimmy is then fired upon, but is saved by Joe.

At Cory&#x27;s apartment, Jimmy and Joe find a taped phone conversation between Senator Calvin Baynard, who leads a congressional investigation into gambling in sports, and Stallions owner Sheldon Marcone. When Joe was in the Secret Service, he witnessed Baynard torturing a woman in a hotel room and assaulted the Senator to save her. Baynard retaliated by having Joe fired for refusing to cover up the incident. When the tape is ruined in Joe&#x27;s faulty car stereo, Jimmy realizes that Cory tried using the tape against Marcone to put Jimmy back on the team, prompting Marcone to send the hitmen. Joe saves Jimmy from another car bomb, and tricks two hitmen into blowing themselves up. However, the explosion destroys the remaining evidence.

At Joe&#x27;s house, Jimmy attempts to use cocaine in the bathroom. However, Joe catches Jimmy and kicks him out. As Jimmy leaves, Joe&#x27;s daughter Darian asks him to sign a football trading card. She states that Joe was a fan of Jimmy&#x27;s and never watched another game after he was banned from the league.

Learning of Mike&#x27;s affair with Sarah, the police assume that Joe killed him and move to make an arrest. Milo, Marcone&#x27;s top henchman, captures Joe first and shoots a detective using Joe&#x27;s gun. Marcone has been buying Senate votes to legalize sports gambling, but Baynard tried to blackmail Marcone for $6 million. Aware of Joe&#x27;s history with Baynard, Marcone explains it would be cheaper to kill the senator and frame Joe for the murder. Joe is taken to a wooded area and forced to hand a briefcase with money to Baynard&#x27;s bodyguards, and Marcone&#x27;s men surreptitiously switch it with a briefcase containing a bomb. Joe is rescued by Jimmy and Darian, and acquires both briefcases after running the bodyguards and Milo off the road. However, Milo survives and while Darian is left to wait for the police, she is abducted by Milo.

Heading to the stadium to rescue Darian, Joe and Jimmy are captured and escorted to Marcone&#x27;s office. Jimmy creates a diversion, allowing them to fight their way free. Realizing that Milo plans to shoot Baynard, Joe goes after Milo while sending Jimmy to warn the senator. Grabbing the game ball, Jimmy throws it at Baynard, knocking him down just as Milo starts to open fire. Joe knocks Milo to the edge of the stadium light platform, where SWAT officers shoot him before he falls into the moving rotor blades of a police helicopter. The briefcase of money is recovered and Marcone, having escaped with the rigged briefcase, is killed when he opens it at his estate. 

The next day, Joe and Sarah reconcile, and Joe and Jimmy decide to become partners.

==Cast==
Other actors in the film include Eddie Griffin as The Strip Club DJ, Sara Suzanne Brown as Stripper, Ryan Cutrona as Harp, Michael Papajohn as Hitman, Jack Kehler as The Scrabble Man, Manny Perry as Cigar Thug, Rick Ducommun as The Pool Owner, and Morris Chestnut as The Locker Room Kid.

Singer Bill Medley, and Sports Commentators Verne Lundquist, Dick Butkus and Lynn Swann appear as Themselves.

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===
The film was based on an original script by Shane Black. He wrote the script after having taken a two-year break from writing, triggered in part by the end of a relationship. The Geffen Film Company outbid other companies, paying a record $1.75 million for the script, with over a $1 million guaranteed up front. Black later recalled:
I was busy mourning my life and, in many ways, the loss of my first real love. I didn&#x27;t feel much like doing anything except smoking cigarettes and reading paperbacks. All things come around. Time passed and eventually I sat down and transformed some of that bitterness into a character, the central focus of a private eye story which became &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;. Writing that script was a very cathartic experience, one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. I spent so much time alone working on that. Days which I wouldn&#x27;t speak. Three, four days where I maybe said a couple words. It was a wonderfully intense time where my focus was better than it&#x27;s ever been. And I was rewarded so handsomely ($1.75 million) for that script, it felt like a vindication and like I was back on track.

Roger Ebert, commenting on the script, said &quot;The original screenplay for &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; set a record for its purchase price; that was probably because of the humor of the locker-room dialogue, since the plot itself could have been rewritten out of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies by any film school grad.&quot;

Joel Silver was guaranteed $1 million to produce. Silver said in a Q&amp;A for &quot;The Nice Guys&quot; (2016) that Shane Black&#x27;s original title was &quot;Die Hard&quot;. Silver asked if he could take the title for a project he was working on at the time called &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988).

=== Filming ===
&quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; was filmed in 90 days between March 11 and June 9, 1991. Filming took place primarily in and around Los Angeles, California. The football stadium scenes were filmed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and San Diego Stadium.

The movie had a very troubled production. Conflict and arguments flared between Joel Silver, Bruce Willis and Tony Scott. Although they partner up in the film, Willis and Damon Wayans hated working with each other. Silver was described as &quot;insane, with long, horrible fits of sanity,&quot; and was compared to a fighter pilot riding as a passenger. &quot;As soon as you hit a little bit of turbulence, he&#x27;s right away going to throw the guy out of the window and take over the steering.&quot; Taylor Negron also remarked that Silver was directly involved throughout the production.

Assistant director James Skotchdopole attributed the tension on-set to an &quot;overabundance of alpha males on that project. Bruce was at the height of his stardom, so was Joel, so was Tony and so was Shane. There were a lot of people who had a lot of opinions about what to do. There were some heated, early-Nineties, testosterone charged personalities on the line. It was a &#x27;charged environment,&#x27; shall we say.&quot; Writer Shane Black had to wrestle with the script. &quot;I was forced to do more rewriting on that movie than on anything else I&#x27;ve done. There was tremendous pressure from the studio to get Bruce Willis and have this be a follow-up to &quot;Die Hard&quot;. He was reluctant, and rightly so: &#x27;This whole movie is about me saving my wife. I just did that in &quot;Die Hard&quot;.&#x27; So they said, &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s minimize the wife and, and while we&#x27;re at it, add a big finale.&#x27; There was a general pressure to somehow make it bigger.&quot;

=== Editing ===
More problems emerged during post-production, when the original cut of the film turned out be a &quot;borderline unwatchable workprint.&quot; Different editors were hired in an attempt to address Scott&#x27;s tendency for filming excessive coverage with multiple cameras. Editor Mark Helfrich described sorting through &quot;mountains of raw material&quot; to edit the first cut: &quot;There was more footage shot for &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; than on any film I had ever worked on.&quot; He recalled with incredulity that the work of previous editors appeared to have been rejected, taken apart and put back into the daily reels: &quot;There were still splices all over the place.&quot; Veteran action film editor Mark Goldblatt was also brought in to work on the film. He later referred to the experience as one of the most frustrating jobs of his career and has often declined to discuss it in detail, although he did mention in a podcast interview that several editors were hired and then fired before him, and that Warner Bros. began testing the movie before it was completely finished. Studio executives fretted about the expanding budget, while less-than-enthusiastic reactions from a test screening audience, as well as the unlikeable character played by Willis, did little to allay these concerns.

When editor Stuart Baird was hired, the film finally took a positive turn. Baird had been brought in to help re-edit other troubled productions, including &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989) and &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993). Some later cuts were done with the film&#x27;s graphic scenes after it was originally rated NC-17, which explains quick-cut edits in some of the death scenes in the film.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen (who also scored &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; that year), his only work for Tony Scott. Bill Medley performed the song &quot;Friday Night&#x27;s A Great Night For Football&quot;, written by Steve Dorff and John Bettis, on screen during the opening credits (the song is also reprised over the end titles); the song was released as a CD single by Curb Records.

On August 25, 2015, La-La Land Records released a limited edition soundtrack album featuring most of Kamen&#x27;s score, plus Medley&#x27;s song.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film under-performed expectations given the star power and hype surrounding the then record price paid for the screenplay by Shane Black ($1.75 million). It grossed $7.9 million in its opening weekend, and the total gross in the United States and Canada was $59.5 million. Internationally, the film grossed $55 million for a worldwide gross of $114.5 million. Reviews were mixed, and some critics cited the Christmas time release for such a violent film as a reason for its somewhat underwhelming box office. Although the film was not a blockbuster, it helped Bruce Willis recover his star status after the disastrous &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; and became hugely popular in the video rental market.

=== Critical response ===

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; is as explosive, silly, and fun as it does represent the decline of the buddy-cop genre.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying it was &quot;a superb example of what it is: a glossy, skillful, cynical, smart, utterly corrupt and vilely misogynistic action thriller.&quot; Owen Gleiberman praised it as &quot;a cheerfully disreputable buddy thriller that also happens to be one of the most entertaining movies of the season ... [and] gives the actors room to stretch out.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described the plot as &quot;a haze of barely connected story lines about political corruption, pro-football, gambling, infidelity, and blackmail [where] all the questions are answered by another car chase, smashing someone in the face or shooting someone in the forehead.&quot; In a highly critical review, Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;the filmic equivalent of a hate crime. ... It&#x27;s mindless, anti-civilization formula for boys who can&#x27;t get enough.&quot;

Retrospective reviews praised the writing, the direction, and the chemistry between Willis and Wayans, and some critics noted it as one of the best films in Scott&#x27;s catalog. In 2022, Alan Sepinwall from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot; on &quot;The Best of Bruce Willis: 10 Memorables TV and Movie Performances&quot; and said: &quot;The neo-noir thriller The Last Boy Scout is on some level (also) trash — bookended by wildly over-the-top action sequences at football stadiums — elevated not only by director Tony Scott&#x27;s self-awareness of how ridiculous it all is, but by the sheer force of Willis&#x27; performance as a disgraced Secret Service agent turned seedy private detective&quot;

=== Creator response ===
Shane Black and Tony Scott both expressed dissatisfaction with the final film, and said in later years how the original script was far better. Scott accused Joel Silver of interfering with the production and swore off working with Silver again. His next film, &quot;True Romance&quot;, features an unflattering film producer character patterned after Silver.

=== Accolades ===

The film was nominated for two MTV Movie Awards.

<doc id="706880" wikidata="Q1616713" url="?curid=706880" title="Jayson Williams">
<text>Jayson Williams (born February 22, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 11 seasons, primarily with the New Jersey Nets. He played his first three seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, who acquired him in trade with the Phoenix Suns following the 1990 NBA draft. Williams spent the remainder of his career with the Nets and was an All-Star in 1998. He was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.

Williams was charged in 2002 with the accidental shooting death of a limousine driver. He pled guilty to aggravated assault in 2010 and served a 27-month prison sentence.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Ritter, South Carolina, to Elijah Joshua &quot;EJ&quot; Williams and Barbara Williams. He is of Polish, Italian and African-American descent. His mother Barbara worked for years at Gouverneur skilled nursing facility in lower Manhattan. Raised Catholic, Williams moved to Brooklyn at the age of twelve and attended Christ The King Regional High School and St. John&#x27;s University, both in New York City, and played on the basketball team at both.

==Professional career==
Williams was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round with the 21st pick of the 1990 NBA draft. His draft rights were thereafter traded by the Suns to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 1993 first-round draft choice on October 28, 1990. After two seasons as a bench player with the 76ers, Williams was traded to the New Jersey Nets for conditional draft choices on October 8, 1992.

While with the Nets, Williams only earned 12 starts in his first three seasons with the team before finally earning a full-time starting position in the 1996–97 season. 

In the first game of the following season, Williams set a franchise record with 17 offensive rebounds (20 total) in a win over the Indiana Pacers. 

In that 1997–98 season, Williams was named an All Star. He led the league in offensive rebounds and offensive rebound percentage while also finishing the season in the top five in total rebounds, rebounds per game, total rebound percentage and offensive rating.

===Injury and retirement===
Williams&#x27; career came to a sudden end on April 1, 1999, after he broke his right leg in a collision with teammate Stephon Marbury in a game against the Atlanta Hawks. The following day, Williams underwent career-ending surgery in which a plate and five screws were inserted into his leg. After sitting out the entire 1999–2000 season, Williams officially announced his retirement on June 28, 2000, at the age of 32 after 11 seasons. At the time of the injury, Williams was in the first year of a six-year, $90 million contract. 

In 2005, he briefly came out of retirement to play for the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association.

==Legal incidents==
In 1992, Williams was accused of breaking a beer mug over a patron&#x27;s head at a saloon in Chicago. 

In 1994, Williams was accused of firing a semiautomatic weapon into the parking lot at the Meadowlands Sports Complex. 

He was never criminally charged in either case.

===The death of Gus Christofi===
On February 14, 2002, 55-year-old limousine driver Costas &quot;Gus&quot; Christofi was shot and killed at Williams&#x27;s estate in Alexandria Township, New Jersey. Christofi had been hired to drive Williams&#x27;s NBA charity team from a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, event to his mansion, about northwest of Trenton, New Jersey. Members of Williams&#x27;s NBA charity basketball team were present at the scene. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Williams was showing people around his house when he aimed a shotgun at Christofi and killed him.

===Initial trial and appeal===
In April 2004, Williams was acquitted of the more serious charges against him, but the court&#x27;s jury deadlocked on a charge of reckless manslaughter. He was convicted on four counts of trying to cover up the shooting.

On April 21, 2006, a Hunterdon County appeals court ruled that Williams could be retried on a reckless manslaughter charge.

===Suicidal agitation===
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) reported on April 27, 2009, that Williams had become suicidal and violent in a NYC hotel room. Upon entering the Manhattan hotel room police said that Williams was visibly intoxicated, and that empty bottles of prescription medications were found around the room. Officers stunned him with a taser and took him to a hospital.

===Bar fight===
A few weeks after the NYC tasering incident, on May 24, 2009, Williams allegedly punched a man in the face at a bar in Raleigh, North Carolina. He was charged with simple assault. The charges were later dropped.

===Drunken car accident===
A few days before an important courtroom appearance, Williams crashed his Mercedes into a tree in lower Manhattan. He was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) after this early morning accident on January 5, 2010. 

===Convictions and sentencing===
On January 11, 2010, Williams pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in the 2002 death of Christofi. A month later, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison with possible parole after 18 months. 

He was convicted and sentenced to an additional year in Rikers Island for the DWI. of which he served 8 months. 

Williams was ultimately released from prison in April 2012.

===Effects of prison===
After being released from his 27 months in prison, Williams told ESPN: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see anybody in a cage, man. Everybody thinks they&#x27;re so tough... I&#x27;ve never seen a newbie go to jail and not cry the first two months every night, scream and have to get suicide prevention in front of his cell.&quot; 

At that time, Williams reported being haunted not only by the shooting but also by how that incident contributed to the death of his own father: &quot;I struggle with the loss of lives. The loss of Mr. Christofi and the loss of my father. An hour doesn&#x27;t go by that I don&#x27;t think about [the accident], think about how can I replay this as to bring back Mr. Christofi. And not one person died that night, two people died. My dad had never been in the hospital in 70 years. That&#x27;s the ripple effect.&quot;

==Indoor lacrosse==
Williams was the principal owner of the New Jersey Storm of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The franchise operated for two seasons, 2002 and 2003, before moving to Anaheim, California, and becoming the Anaheim Storm.

The team went out of business before the start of the 2006 season.

==Books==
Following his NBA retirement, Williams wrote &quot;Loose Balls&quot;, a memoir that was published in 2001. Intended to be a humorous perspective on his life in the NBA, later readers noted that the book contained nine separate episodes in which Williams behaved recklessly with guns. In one incident, the former NFL football player Wayne Chrebet was nearly shot. In another, the uncle of Manute Bol was threatened with an unloaded handgun.

In 2012, Williams published a second book, an autobiography entitled &quot;Humbled ~ Letters From Prison&quot;. The book included revelations about his having been abused as a child.

A third book, &quot;Crashing: A Memoir&quot;, was published in December 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Williams proposed during halftime of a nationally televised basketball game to model Cynthia Bailey. The two later parted.

Williams married Kellie Batiste in December 1999; they divorced soon afterward. In 2000, he married Tanya Young and together they had two daughters. The couple divorced in 2011. Young was a cast member of VH1&#x27;s reality TV show &quot;Basketball Wives: LA&quot;.

Williams&#x27; father, Elijah Joshua Williams, died of a stroke at the age of 76 in November 2009. Williams had three sisters, with two having died from AIDS (one after a blood transfusion following a mugging), while his third sister was killed by her husband in a murder-suicide.

== Legacy ==
Williams was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame with the Class of 2016 and into the St. John&#x27;s University athletics Hall of Fame in 2023.

<text>The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA, better known as FedLoan) is a quasi-governmental agency that administers several state-level and national higher education student financial aid programs.

== History ==
It was created in 1963 by an Act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and engages in loan guaranty, loan servicing, financial aid processing, outreach and other student aid programs.

It was announced on July 8, 2021 that the agency and the United States Department of Education would not continue their relationship, effective on December 14, 2021.

In October 2007, Jack Wagner, the Pennsylvania auditor general, released a report accusing the agency of giving excessive bonuses and incentives. Rep. Bill Adolph, chairman of the agency&#x27;s board, subsequently scheduled an emergency meeting of the board for Wednesday, October 10, to request the early resignation of the president of the agency, Richard E. Willey, based on reporting from the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; and the Associated Press.

Since 2007, PHEAA has undergone a series of reforms and cost-cutting initiatives including the elimination of management bonuses, automatic salary increases and all sponsorships and advertisements that were not in line with PHEAA&#x27;s mission. The Board also instituted one of the nation&#x27;s strictest business and travel expense reimbursement policies. Those reforms resulted in more than $77 million in savings.

== Functions ==
It administers the grant program for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and serves as a coordinating body for other grant programs administered by other state agencies. It also served as one of several student loan guarantors in the United States for the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), under the Higher Education Act of 1965. It also has a loan servicing operation for student loans that it owns and for lenders under contract. Originally a small student loan guarantor with approximately 5,000 student loans a year after its formation, it at one point managed more than $100 billion in total assets and serves nearly four million students through its various programs.

PHEAA conducts its student loan servicing activities nationally as FedLoan Servicing and American Education Services (AES). FedLoan Servicing was established in 2009 to support the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s ability to service student loans owned by the federal government, and is one of a limited number of organizations approved by the Department to service these loans. AES was created to guarantee and service a variety of Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and private student loan products for lending partners nationwide. PHEAA exited the FedLoan Servicing Market in December 2022.

PHEAA&#x27;s earnings are used to support its operations and to pay its operating costs, including administration of the Pennsylvania State Grant and other state-funded student aid programs.

As a quasi-governmental agency, AES/PHEAA&#x27;s board of directors consists of members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the secretary of education, and gubernatorial appointees. The legislative members of the Board were successful in passing legislation that restructures the PHEAA Board of Directors, which was signed into law by the Governor on July 9, 2010. This legislation was based on a PHEAA Board resolution that called upon the General Assembly to replace legislative seats on the Board with private-sector individuals who could provide leadership expertise in an increasingly complex financial environment. Specifically, the legislation reduces the number of lawmakers serving on the 20-member Board from 16 to 12. The four legislative seats were replaced with private-sector professionals with experience in banking, investments and information technology; adding their expertise to the decisions that the Board makes on behalf of Pennsylvania students and families. The legislation also reduces the six-year Board term to four years. 
==Controversies==

* In 2007, former Department of Education researcher, Jon Oberlander, filed a False Claims Suit against PHEAA and other lenders. PHEAA is accused of taking advantage of a loophole (now referred to as the 9.5% Scandal), and defrauding U.S. taxpayers of millions of dollars. In its defense, PHEEA argued that sovereign immunity protected it against False Claims Act suits. The company ultimately lost its claim to sovereign immunity, but succeeded in defending itself against Oberg&#x27;s suit.
* On 8 January 2018, Massachusetts state&#x27;s attorney general Maura Healey sued the company over its handling of the TEACH grant program and the larger Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. After breaking the story on its &quot;Morning Edition&quot; broadcast in March 2018, NPR received dozens of responses from teachers all over the country who had experienced the same problem. One in three grants were converted to loans (with interest) for failure to file proper paperwork or even to hand paperwork in one day late.

<doc id="706884" wikidata="Q1022922" url="?curid=706884" title="Waterspout">
<text>A waterspout is a rotating column of air that occurs over a body of water, usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud in contact with the water and a cumuliform cloud. There are two types of waterspout, each formed by distinct mechanisms. The most common type is a weak vortex known as a &quot;fair weather&quot; or &quot;non-tornadic&quot; waterspout. The other less common type is simply a classic tornado occurring over water rather than land, known as a &quot;tornadic&quot;, &quot;supercellular&quot;, or &quot;mesocyclonic&quot; waterspout, and accurately a &quot;tornado over water&quot;. A fair weather waterspout has a five-part life cycle: formation of a dark spot on the water surface; spiral pattern on the water surface; formation of a spray ring; development of a visible condensation funnel; and ultimately, decay. Most waterspouts do not suck up water.

While waterspouts form mostly in tropical and subtropical areas, they are also reported in Europe, Western Asia (the Middle East), Australia, New Zealand, the Great Lakes, Antarctica, and on rare occasions, the Great Salt Lake. Some are also found on the East Coast of the United States, and the coast of California. Although rare, waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake-effect snow precipitation bands.

==Characteristics==

=== Climatology ===
Though the majority of waterspouts occur in the tropics, they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world, and are common across the western coast of Europe as well as the British Isles and several areas of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea. They are not restricted to saltwater; many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. They are fairly common on the Great Lakes during late summer and early fall, with a record 66+ waterspouts reported over just a seven-day period in 2003.

Waterspouts are more frequent within from the coast than farther out at sea. They are common along the southeast U.S. coast, especially off southern Florida and the Keys, and can happen over seas, bays, and lakes worldwide. Approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across Europe, with the Netherlands reporting the most at 60, followed by Spain and Italy at 25, and the United Kingdom at 15. They are most common in late summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, September has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation. Waterspouts are also frequently observed off the east coast of Australia, with several being described by Joseph Banks during the voyage of the Endeavour in 1770.

===Formation===
Waterspouts exist on a microscale, where their environment is less than two kilometers in width. The cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus, or as great as a supercell. While some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature, most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics. They normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development, and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface, and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low-level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm. Some weak tornadoes, known as landspouts, have been shown to develop in a similar manner.

More than one waterspout can occur simultaneously in the same vicinity. In 2012, as many as nine simultaneous waterspouts were reported on Lake Michigan in the United States. In May 2021, at least five simultaneous waterspouts were filmed near Taree, off the northern coast of New South Wales, Australia.

==Types==
=== Non-tornadic ===
Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as &quot;non-tornadic&quot; or &quot;fair-weather&quot; waterspouts. By far the most common type of waterspout, these occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective cumulus towers. Fair-weather waterspouts develop and dissipate rapidly, having life cycles shorter than 20 minutes. They usually rate no higher than EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, generally exhibiting winds of less than .

They are most frequently seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates, with upwards of 400 per year observed in the Florida Keys. They typically move slowly, if at all, since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static, being formed by vertical convective action rather than the subduction/adduction interaction between colliding fronts. Fair-weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to landspouts, and largely behave as such if they move ashore.

There are five stages to a fair-weather waterspout life cycle. Initially, a prominent circular, light-colored disk appears on the surface of the water, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape. After the formation of these colored disks on the water, a pattern of light- and dark-colored spiral bands develops from the dark spot on the water surface. Then, a dense of sea spray, called a &quot;cascade&quot;, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye. Eventually, the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud. The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more, and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves. Finally, the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens, ending the waterspout&#x27;s life cycle.

===Tornadic===
&quot;Tornadic waterspouts&quot;, also accurately referred to as &quot;tornadoes over water&quot;, are formed from mesocyclones in a manner essentially identical to land-based tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms, but simply occurring over water. A tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout. Since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms in the United States occur in land-locked areas, true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair-weather counterparts in that country. However, in some areas, such as the Adriatic, Aegean and Ionian Seas, tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number.

=== Snowspout === 
A &quot;winter waterspout&quot;, also known as an &quot;icespout&quot;, an &quot;ice devil&quot;, or a &quot;snowspout&quot;, is a rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall. The term &quot;winter waterspout&quot; is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event. There are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout. Very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water, which is itself warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the water&#x27;s surface. Like the more efficient lake-effect snow events, winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and increase the likelihood of a winter waterspout developing.

The terms &quot;snow devil&quot; and &quot;snownado&quot; describe a different phenomenon: a snow vortex close to the surface with no parent cloud, similar to a dust devil.

==Impacts==

=== Human ===
Waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose a threat to watercraft, aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.

Incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare; however, there have been several notable examples. The Malta tornado of 1551 was the earliest recorded occurrence of a deadly waterspout. It struck the Grand Harbour of Valletta, sinking four galleys and numerous boats, and killing hundreds of people. The 1851 Sicily tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily, ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea. In August 2024, a waterspout has been reported by some witnesses of the sinking of the large yacht Bayesian off the coast of Sicily and might have been the cause or an aggravating circumstance. Seven people died while 15 of 22 were rescued.

===Natural===
Depending on how fast the winds from a waterspout are whipping, anything that is within about of the surface of the water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air. A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of the water and all the way up into the cloud. Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted up and down and around with the cloud&#x27;s winds until its currents no longer keep the fish airborne. Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere, the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down. People as far as inland have experienced raining fish. Fish can also be sucked up from rivers, but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon.

== Research and forecasting ==
The Szilagyi Waterspout Index (SWI), developed by Canadian meteorologist Wade Szilagyi, is used to predict conditions favorable for waterspout development. The SWI ranges from −10 to +10, where values greater than or equal to zero represent conditions favorable for waterspout development.
The International Centre for Waterspout Research (ICWR) is a non-governmental organization of individuals from around the world who are interested in the field of waterspouts from a research, operational and safety perspective. Originally a forum for researchers and meteorologists, the ICWR has expanded interest and contribution from storm chasers, the media, the marine and aviation communities and from private individuals.

== Myths ==
There was a commonly held belief among sailors in the 18th and 19th centuries that shooting a broadside cannon volley dispersed waterspouts. Among others, Captain Vladimir Bronevskiy claims that it was a successful technique, having been an eyewitness to the dissipation of a phenomenon in the Adriatic while a midshipman aboard the frigate &quot;Venus&quot; during the 1806 campaign under Admiral Senyavin.

A waterspout has been proposed as a reason for the abandonment of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

<text>Prokop the Great (, ) or Prokop the Bald or the Shaven (, ) (c. 1380 – 30 May 1434) was a Czech Hussite general and a prominent Taborite military leader during the Hussite Wars. On his mother&#x27;s side, he came from a German patrician family living in Prague.

Initially, Prokop was a member of the Utraquists (the moderate wing of the Hussites) and was a married priest (having received the tonsure early in life) who belonged to an eminent, partly German-speaking family from Prague. He studied in Prague, and then traveled for several years in foreign countries. On his return to Bohemia, though a priest and continuing to officiate as such, he became the most prominent leader of the advanced Hussite or Taborite forces during the latter part of the Hussite Wars. He was not the immediate successor of Jan Žižka as leader of the Taborites, as has been frequently stated, but he commanded the forces of Tabor when they obtained their great victories over the Germans and Catholics at Ústí nad Labem in 1426 and Domažlice in 1431. The crushing defeat that he inflicted on the crusaders of the Holy Roman Empire at Domažlice led to peace negotiations (1432) at Cheb between the Hussites and representatives of the Council of Basel.

He also acted as leader of the Taborites during their frequent incursions into Hungary and Germany, particularly when in 1429 a vast Bohemian army invaded Saxony and the territory of Nuremberg. The Hussites, however, made no attempt permanently to conquer German territory, and on 6 February 1430 Prokop concluded a treaty at Kulmbach with Frederick I, burgrave of Nuremberg, by which the Hussites engaged themselves to leave Germany. When the Bohemians entered into negotiations with Sigismund and the Council of Basel and, after prolonged discussions, resolved to send an embassy to the council, Prokop the Great was its most prominent member, reaching Basel on 4 January 1433. When the negotiations there for a time proved fruitless, Prokop with the other envoys returned to Bohemia, where new internal troubles broke out.

A Taborite army led by Prokop the Great besieged Plzeň, which was then in the hands of the Catholics. The discipline in the Hussite camp had, however, slackened in the course of prolonged warfare, and the Taborites encamped before Plzeň revolted against Prokop, who therefore returned to Prague.
Probably encouraged by these dissensions among the men of Tabor, the Bohemian nobility, both Catholic and Utraquist, formed a league for the purpose of opposing radicalism, which through the victories of Tabor had acquired great strength in the Bohemian towns. The struggle began at Prague. Aided by the nobles, the citizens of the Old Town took possession of the more radical New Town, Prague, which Prokop unsuccessfully attempted to defend. Prokop now called to his aid Prokop the Lesser, who had succeeded him in the command of the Taborite army before Plzeň. They jointly retreated eastward from Prague, and their forces, known as the army of the towns, met the army of the nobles between Kourim and Kolín in the Battle of Lipany (30 May 1434). The Taborites were decisively defeated, and both Prokops, Great and Lesser, perished in the battle.

The fourth rifle regiment of Czechoslovak legions was named after him in July 1917.

==In popular culture==
Martin Růžek portrayed Prokop the Great in 1963 film &quot;Spanilá jízda&quot;. Prokop the Great also appears in 2013 animated film &quot;The Hussites&quot;.

Prokop the Great is a supporting character in a 2022 video game &quot;1428: Shadows over Silesia&quot;.

<doc id="706903" wikidata="Q588602" url="?curid=706903" title="Search for Tomorrow">
<text>Search for Tomorrow is an American television soap opera. It began its run on CBS on September 3, 1951, and concluded on NBC, 35 years later, on December 26, 1986.

Set in the fictional town of Henderson in an unspecified state, the show focused primarily on the character of Joanne &quot;Jo&quot; Gardner, portrayed by Mary Stuart for the entire run of the series.

==Broadcast history and production notes==
Created by Roy Winsor, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; was originally written by Agnes Nixon (then known professionally as Agnes Eckhardt) for the series&#x27; first 13 weeks, before Irving Vendig assumed head writing duties. The program was one of several daytime soap operas produced from the 1950s through the 1980s by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions, the broadcasting arm of the famed household products corporation. Procter &amp; Gamble used the program, as well as the company&#x27;s other serials, to advertise its products (such as its Joy dishwashing liquid and Spic and Span household cleaner). As &quot;Search&quot;″s ratings increased, other sponsors began buying commercial time during the program.

&quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; initially aired as a 15-minute serial from its debut in 1951 until 1968, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern/11:30 a.m. Central Time. The serial discontinued live broadcasts in favor of recorded telecasts in March 1967, began broadcasting in color on September 11, 1967, and expanded to a half-hour on September 9, 1968, keeping the 12:30/11:30 slot, while its old 15-minute partner &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; also expanded to 30 minutes and moved to the CBS afternoon lineup at 2:30/1:30. At the time, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, which had shared the same half-hour for sixteen years, were the last two 15-minute daytime programs airing on television. &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; would remain the top-rated show at 12:30/11:30 well into the late 1970s, despite strong competition from shows like NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Who, What, or Where Game&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Split Second&quot; and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;.

On June 8, 1981, CBS moved &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; from its longtime 12:30 p.m./11:30 a.m. Central time slot, which it had held for 30 years, to the 2:30/1:30 p.m. time slot between its two P&amp;G sister shows, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, in order to accommodate the hit serial &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Procter &amp; Gamble urged CBS to return &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; to its former slot. The program&#x27;s relocation confused or angered many longtime viewers habituated to seeing it earlier in the day. Another P&amp;G-produced soap opera, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, had suffered the same problem six years earlier when the company insisted that the show be moved to the 2:30/1:30 p.m. time slot; it had previously dominated the other two networks in the ratings when the show was airing at 3:30/2:30 p.m. for almost a decade. This move was made on CBS part to give &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; a half-hour head start on ABC&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot;, which was part of the trio of ABC soaps, along with &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, that led the network to dominate the top three spots in the daytime ratings (an achievement ABC first reached during the 1980–81 season) at the time. CBS refused to move &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; back to its original 12:30/11:30 time slot and, as the show&#x27;s contract with CBS was about to expire, Procter &amp; Gamble sold the broadcast rights to &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; to NBC rather than negotiate a renewal with CBS. NBC already had two soaps produced by P&amp;G, &quot;Another World&quot; and its &quot;Dallas&quot;-inspired spin-off &quot;Texas&quot;, as part of its daytime lineup. &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; aired its last episode on CBS on March 26, 1982, and had its NBC premiere the following Monday, March 29; CBS filled the program&#x27;s former time slot with a new political soap opera, &quot;Capitol&quot;.

The shift from CBS to NBC would prove to be the beginning of the serial&#x27;s terminal decline. At its new network, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; now found itself going head-to-head with its former CBS stablemate &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and would later face additional soap competition when &quot;Loving&quot; premiered on ABC in June 1983. Additionally, several NBC-affiliated stations opted to run syndicated programming or local newscasts in the 12:00/11:00 slot, a practice dating back to NBC&#x27;s daytime ratings struggles in the 1970s that also affected already struggling soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;, which was airing at 12:30/11:30, until NBC bumped it to 12:00/11:00 (the fourth and final time slot that the show occupied during its 19-year run) to accommodate &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. (&quot;The Doctors&quot;, along with &quot;Texas&quot;, were both canceled at the end of 1982.) As a result, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;″s ratings plummeted through its four-year run on NBC and never recovered; it was among the lowest-rated soaps on television at the time, kept alive mainly by its hardcore and largely elderly fans. As such, the show was increasingly unappealing to advertisers other than P&amp;G. (&quot;The Edge of Night&quot; faced similar issues following its move to ABC in the 4:00/3:00 timeslot, where it did only slightly better in the ratings, before being cancelled in 1984 due to the erosion of its overall ratings caused in part by affiliate preemptions for syndicated programming.)

On August 4, 1983, both the master copy and the backup of an episode of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; scheduled for that day were reported missing, and the cast was forced to do a live show for the first time since the transition to recorded broadcasts 16 years earlier. It was the first live daytime serial since two other CBS soaps, &quot;As The World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, had discontinued the practice in 1975; to date, the only other soap operas to have done live episodes in any capacity since – albeit as programming stunts – were ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (for a one-week &quot;sweeps&quot; stint from May 13–17, 2002) and &quot;General Hospital&quot; (for two episodes on May 15 and 18, 2015). 

In the fall of 1986, NBC announced that &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; would be canceled, citing its declining ratings. The show aired its 9,130th and final episode on December 26, 1986, after 35 years on the air. At the time of its cancellation, it was the longest-running daytime program in American television history, but has since been surpassed by other shows. The following Monday, the game show &quot;Wordplay&quot; took over the 12:30 p.m. Eastern time slot.

===Syndication===
From 1987 until the summer of 1989, reruns of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; aired late nights on the USA Network. The cable network aired episodes from the first three years on NBC (1982–1985), along with its sister P&amp;G soap &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;.

In 2006, P&amp;G began making several of its soap operas available, a few episodes at a time, through America Online&#x27;s AOL Video service, downloadable free of charge. Reruns of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; began with the October 5, 1984, episode and ceased with the January 13, 1986, episode after AOL discontinued the P&amp;G Soaps Channel on December 31, 2008.

<doc id="706914" wikidata="Q120119" url="?curid=706914" title="Rikers Island">
<text>Rikers Island is a prison island in the East River in the Bronx that contains New York City&#x27;s largest jail.

Named after Abraham Rycken, who took possession of the island in 1664, the island was originally under in size, but has since grown to more than . The first stages of expansion were accomplished largely by convict labor hauling in ashes for landfill. The island is politically part of the Bronx, with a bridge being the only access available from Queens. It is part of Queens Community Board 1 and uses an East Elmhurst, Queens, ZIP Code of 11370 for mail.

The island is the site of one of the world&#x27;s largest correctional institutions and mental institutions, and has been described as New York&#x27;s best-known jail. The complex, operated by the New York City Department of Correction, in 2015 had a budget of $860 million a year, a staff of 9,000 civilian officers and 1,500 other civilians managing 100,000 admissions per year and an average daily population of 10,000 inmates. The majority (85%) of detainees are pretrial defendants, either held on bail or remanded in custody. The rest of the population have been convicted and are serving short sentences. In a 2021 analysis by the New York City Comptroller, it costs the city approximately $556,539 to detain one person for one year at Rikers Island.

Rikers Island has had a reputation for violence, physical and mental abuse and neglect of its inmates, and has attracted press and judicial scrutiny that has resulted in numerous rulings against the New York City government. There have been numerous assaults by inmates on uniformed officers and other civilian staff, often resulting in serious injuries. In May 2013, Rikers Island ranked as one of the ten worst correctional facilities in the entire United States, based on reporting in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine. A documented increase in violence on Rikers Island was reported by the 2010s. In 2015, there were 9,424 assaults, the highest number in five years. In October 2019, the New York City Council voted to close down the facility by 2026.

==Complex and facilities==
The Rikers Island complex, which consists of ten jails, holds local alleged offenders who are awaiting trial, individuals serving sentences of one year or less, or are temporarily detained there pending transfer to another facility. Rikers Island is therefore not a prison by US terminology, which typically holds offenders serving longer-term sentences. It holds 10 of the New York City Department of Correction&#x27;s 15 facilities, and can accommodate up to 15,000 detainees.

Facilities located on the island include:
* Robert N. Davoren Complex (primarily male inmates of ages 18–21)
* Eric M. Taylor Center (sentenced male adolescents and adults)
* Otis Bantum Correctional Center (detained male adults)
* George R. Vierno Center (detained male adults)
* Anna M. Kross Center (detained male adults)
* George Motchan Detention Center (detained male adults)
* Rose M. Singer Center (detained and sentenced female adolescents and adults)
* North Infirmary Command (detainees who require medical attention)
* West Facility (detainees with contagious diseases)
* James A. Thomas Center (no longer used to house detainees)
* &quot;Harold A. Wildstein&quot; (no longer in use)
* &quot;Walter B. Keane&quot; (no longer in use)

The average daily individuals in custody or detainees population on the island is about 10,000, although it can hold a maximum of 15,000. The daytime population, including detainees, staff, and visitors, can be as high as 20,000.

The only road access to the island is from Queens, over the three-lane Francis Buono Bridge, dedicated in November 1966, by Mayor John Lindsay. The street address is 15 Hazen Street, East Elmhurst, NY 11370. Before the bridge was constructed, the only access to the island was by ferry. Transportation is also provided by the MTA Regional Bus Operations route. Privately operated shuttles connect the parking lot at the south end to the island. A bus service within the island for people visiting inmates is provided by the New York City Department of Correction on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

The North Infirmary Command, which used to be called the Rikers Island Infirmary, is used to house inmates requiring extreme protective custody, inmates with special health needs, mentally ill inmates, and inmates undergoing drug detoxification. The Infirmary has the capacity to house overflow inmates from conventional populations. The rest of the facilities, all built in the last 67 years, make up this city of jails, in addition to the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center, a floating barge (described below), as well as schools, medical clinics, ball fields, chapels, gyms, drug rehab programs, grocery stores, barbershops, a bakery, a laundromat, a power plant, a track, a tailor shop, a print shop, a bus depot, and a car wash. It also contains a large composting facility.

Rikers Island has been referred to as the world&#x27;s largest penal colony. For comparison, Europe&#x27;s largest correctional facility, Marmara Prison in European Turkey, sits on and houses 10,904 prisoners.

==History==

===Historic use===

The island is named after Abraham Rycken, a Dutch settler who moved to Long Island in 1638 and took possession of the island in 1664. Rycken&#x27;s descendants, the Ricker family, owned Rikers Island until 1884, when it was sold to the city for $180,000.

The island was used as a military training ground during the Civil War. The first regiment to use the Island was the 9th New York Infantry, also known as Hawkins&#x27; Zouaves, which arrived there on May 15, 1861. Hawkins&#x27; Zouaves was followed by the 36th New York State Volunteers on June 23, which was followed by the Anderson Zouaves on July 15, 1861. The Anderson Zouaves were commanded by John Lafayette Riker, who was related to the owners of the island. 

The camp of the Anderson Zouaves was named Camp Astor in compliment to millionaire John Jacob Astor Jr.. Astor provided funding for the army, and made a significant contribution to the raising of the Anderson Zouaves, with the Astor ladies making the zouave uniforms worn by the recruits of this regiment. Rikers Island was subsequently used by numerous other Civil War regiments, but the name &quot;Camp Astor&quot; was specific to the Anderson Zouaves, and did not become a general name for the military encampment on the island.

In 1883, New York City&#x27;s Commission of Charities and Corrections expressed an interest in purchasing the island for use as a work-house. Any such purchase would have to be approved by the state. In January 1884, state senator Frederick S. Gibbs introduced a bill in the state senate authorizing the commission to purchase the island. In May 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed a bill authorizing the Commissioner of Charities and Corrections to purchase the island for a sum no greater than $180,000. 

At the time, the island was within the boundaries of Long Island City, which was located in Queens County, which was not yet part of New York City. This potential transfer set off squabbling between politicians of Long Island City, Queens County, and New York City. On July 31, 1884, a compromise was agreed to by all three entities. New York City agreed to pay $3,000, with $2,500 given to Long Island City and $500 to Queens County. On August 4, 1884, the Commissioner of Charities and Corrections, Jacob Hess, signed a contract purchasing the island from John T. Wilson, a descendant of the Ryker family, for $180,000. $179,000 went to Wilson and $1,000 for a title search.

===Conversion to jail===

The city expressed a desire to open a jail for men on Rikers Island as early as 1925, in order to replace their overburdened and dilapidated jail on Welfare Island, now Roosevelt Island. The jail was opened in 1932. Landfill continued to be added to the island until 1943, eventually enlarging the original island to . This required the permission of the federal government, since the expansion extended the island&#x27;s pier line. were also stripped from Rikers to help fill in the new North Beach Airport, which opened in 1939 and was later renamed LaGuardia Airport.

The net expansion of the island enabled the jail facilities to expand. The original penitentiary building, completed in 1935, was called HDM, or the House of Detention for Men. It became a maximum security facility called the James A. Thomas Center and closed due to structural issues in 2000.

In 1922, New York City was banned by the courts from dumping garbage in the ocean. Much of it ended up on Rikers Island, even though the island already had 12 mountains of garbage 40 to 130 feet tall. Rikers took in 1.5 million cubic yards of additional refuse, more than the amount of dirt displaced by the building of the World Trade Center. Since much of the garbage was composed of ash from coal heating and incinerators, there were frequent spontaneous phosphorescent fires, even in the wintertime, in the snow. One warden described it in 1934: &quot;At night it is like a forest of Christmas trees – first one little light ... then another, until the whole hillside is lit up with little fires. ... It was beautiful.&quot;

The island was plagued with rats, which at one point were so prevalent that after &quot;poison gas, poison bait, ferocious dogs and pigs&quot; failed to control them, one New Yorker tried to organize a hunting party to kill them off. It was the efforts of &quot;master builder&quot; Robert Moses, who did not want the unsightly island to be the backdrop for his carefully landscaped 1939 World&#x27;s Fair, to get the island cleaned up, and have the city&#x27;s garbage sent elsewhere—ultimately to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island.

During the term of David Dinkins as mayor of New York the jail filled to overflowing. The Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center (VCBC), an 800-bed barge, was installed on the East River at the end of Hunts Point near the Fulton Fish Market to accommodate the extra inmates. The keel for the Vernon C. Bain was laid in 1989 at the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. Upon completion, VCBC was towed up from Louisiana to its current mooring, and attached to two &quot;Crandall Arms&quot;. It opened for use as a facility in 1992. Originally it had been leased to the NYC Department of Juvenile Justice, while Spofford Juvenile Center was under reconstruction. VCBC was formerly known as Maritime Facility #3 (MTF3); facilities 1 and 2 were reconstructed British military transport barges, or BIBBYs (British Industries Boat Building Yard), used during the Falklands War, both of which could house 800 soldiers, but only 200 inmates after their conversion. MTFs 1 and 2 were anchored on either side of Manhattan at East River pier 17, near 20th street, in the Hudson River. In addition, there were two smaller 1950s-era Staten Island Ferry boats, both converted to house 162 inmates each. The ferry boats were sold for salvage around 2003, and the owner of the shipyard that built VCBC, Avondale Shipyard, bought the two BIBBYs. VCBC is the only vessel of its type in the world. Prior to modification for use by New York City, it cost $161 million to construct. The initial plan for acquiring the vessel, because of the way New York City makes capital purchases, had to begin at least five years before the keel was laid, during the tenure of Ed Koch.

===Notable events===
Rikers is close to the runways of LaGuardia Airport. On February 1, 1957, Northeast Airlines Flight 823 crashed onto Rikers Island shortly after departing LaGuardia Airport, killing 20 and injuring 78 out of a total of 95 passengers and 6 crew. After the crash, department personnel and inmates ran to the site to help survivors. As a result of their actions, of the 57 inmates who assisted with the rescue effort, 30 were released and 16 received a sentence reduction of six months by the N.Y.C. Parole Board. Governor Averell Harriman also granted commutation of sentence to 11 men serving definite sentences: two received a six-months&#x27; reduction; one workhouse and eight penitentiary definites became eligible for immediate release.

In 1993, United Blood Nation was founded by Omar Portee and Leonard McKenzie while locked up in the George Mochen Detention Center at Rikers Island.

A drawing by artist Salvador Dalí, done as an apology because he was unable to attend a talk about art for the prisoners at Rikers Island, hung in the inmate dining room in J.A.T.C. (HDM) from 1965 to 1981, when it was moved to the prison lobby in E.M.T.C. (C76) for safekeeping. The drawing was stolen in March 2003 and replaced with a fake. Three correctional officers and an assistant deputy warden were arrested and charged, and though the three later pleaded guilty and one was acquitted, the drawing has not been recovered.

During the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, at the request of the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) and the Executive Director Yolanda Serrano, the prison granted early release to terminal HIV-positive inmates so that they could die peacefully in their own homes.

The prison housed juvenile inmates until 2018. The move was prompted by a law passed by New York state in 2017 requiring that juvenile inmates under 18 be housed separately from adults.

===Proposed closure of jail complex===
In February 2016, the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, also known as the Lippman Commission since it is chaired by former Chief Judge of the State of New York Jonathan Lippman, was convened by New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to review the entirety of the city&#x27;s criminal justice system. In April of that year, Glenn E. Martin launched a campaign that called for the closure of the Rikers Island Jail Complex. In September 2016, the campaign organized a march from Queens Plaza to the Rikers Island Bridge, calling on then-Mayor Bill de Blasio to close the complex.

In the months following, there had been plans to build an additional facility on the island that consisted of 1,500 beds. In November 2016, New York City Department of Correction Commissioner Joseph Ponte said, &quot;As we look at construction and now with the...kind of the movement to close Rikers all those things politically have to be taken into consideration. So the 1,500 bed facility on Rikers is still at...at a kind of pause right now&quot;.

After a year of consideration, the Lippmann Commission released a report of recommendations for closing the jail complex. De Blasio did not specifically endorse the findings of the commission. The Lippman Commission proposed a 10-year plan to close the ten jails currently on the island and replace them with smaller jails, one in each borough closer to the courthouses. The population at Rikers Island would have to decrease from current average of 10,000 to approximately 5,000. According to The Mayor&#x27;s Office of Criminal Justice, key strategies in shrinking the Rikers population have included addressing causes of case delays, identifying individuals that could be granted alternatives to jail time, and improving programming and discharge services. Since 1991, the Rikers population has dropped by more than 50%, when the average daily population was 21,688. The idea of closing the prison complex within 10 years was endorsed by former Mayor Bill de Blasio on March 31, after the &quot;New York Post&quot; leaked the findings of the Lippman Commission.

One possible reuse proposal was to build a low-rise residential development, although the island&#x27;s distance from mass transit, proximity to LaGuardia Airport, and leakage of toxic methane gas from its landfill base would pose problems for the proposed development. It would also mean that each residential unit would cost about twice as much to construct as a normal unit in New York City. The residential development would connect the island to the mainland for the expansion of the airport, using it as a park, for solid-waste management or for manufacturing. However, the commission specifically ruled out its use for private residences. In light of possible closure of the jail complex, New York City Public Advocate Letitia James suggested renaming the island after Kalief Browder, an inmate who committed suicide after being jailed at Rikers.

Another possibility for reuse of the island after closure of the jail complex would be to build an expansion of nearby LaGuardia Airport. According to a 2017 city-sponsored report, incorporating Rikers Island into the airport&#x27;s footprint would allow for the construction of a new, longer runway and additional terminal space, resulting in an estimated 40% increase of flight capacity.

On June 22, 2017, former Mayor de Blasio released his plan for a 10-year shutdown of the facility, saying that it was not a &quot;quick fix&quot;: &quot;This will be a long a difficult path,&quot; he wrote. The city will reduce the inmate population of Rikers through the use of alternative facilities and reforms such as making the payment of bail easier and improving mental health facilities and programs. Two &quot;diversion centers&quot; will assist people with mental health problems and will work with police to find options other than incarceration. Smaller jail facilities will be open throughout the city, but the plan does not fully describe how, where, and when that will occur.

The New York State Commission of Correction, which oversees New York City&#x27;s jails, issued a report in February 2018 citing numerous violations in the facility on the part of the city and a significant increase in violent incidents from 2016 to 2017. It suggested that the state might move to close Rikers Island before the city&#x27;s 10-year deadline, which is not legally binding. On October 17, 2019, the City Council voted for an over $8 billion plan to close the Rikers Island prisons and other New York City jails by 2026, and replace them with four borough-based jails. New prisons are planned, but council members said that a move from arrests to tickets, not prosecuting misdemeanors, and a state law set to eliminate cash bail for misdemeanors would reduce the need for jails.

==Abuse, neglect, and murder of detainees==
Rikers Island has become notorious in recent years for a &quot;culture of abuse&quot;, and has been subject to a number of investigations and rulings.

===Rulings related to strip searches===
In 1986, a federal appeals court ruled that strip searches could not be performed on people arrested on misdemeanor charges, like fare evasion on the subway, or marijuana smoking. The case itself was brought by Ann Weber, who was arrested for making an inflated claim on a 911 call, after her son was attacked while leaving her daughter&#x27;s wedding. She was brought to jail still dressed in formal wedding attire, locked in a cell, and forced to strip and expose her cavities for search in the hour it took for her daughter to arrive and post bail.

Prior to this decision, all prisoners taken to Rikers, no matter the level of their accusation, were strip searched. These searches often took place in groups of 10 to 12 and involved genital and anal searches. Despite the court&#x27;s ruling, the practice lived on, costing New York City a total of $81 million in settlements to the victims of these illegal searches. In 2001, a ruling was reached in New York reinforcing the illegality of strip searches for misdemeanor detainees, and demanding that the city pay up to $50 million to the tens of thousands of people who were illegally searched over the years.

However, the practice did not die. Another suit was filed against the city in 2007 for performing strip searches on inmates taken to Rikers on misdemeanor charges. On October 4, 2007, the New York City Department of Corrections conceded that tens of thousands of nonviolent inmates taken to Rikers Island on misdemeanor charges had been wrongly strip-searched in violation of a 2002 court settlement, and were entitled to payment for damages. The policy was kept in place despite a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruling in 2001 that strip-searches of misdemeanor suspects were illegal, unless officials suspected that they were carrying contraband...&quot; [Lead lawyer Richard D.] Emery charged in his papers that department officials &quot;repeatedly resorted to lying to cover up deliberate indifference to the continued practice of humiliating detainees by forcing them to strip naked in groups.&quot; This class action suit won $33 million in damages.

===Inmates as enforcers===
In February 2008, correctional officer Lloyd Nicholson was indicted after he allegedly used a select group of teenage inmates as enforcers under a regime called &quot;the program&quot;, as well as allegedly beating inmates himself. However, &quot;the program&quot; has been known to exist for well over a decade and is unique to the adolescents. The inmates use it as a test for other inmates and a system of control amongst themselves.

A &quot;Village Voice&quot; article lists a roll call of 2008 scandals at Rikers, including the case of officers who allegedly passed accused cop killer Lee Woods marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol; the February indictment of correctional officer Lloyd Nicholson who used inmates as &quot;enforcers&quot;, and the April 27 suicide of 18-year-old Steven Morales (who allegedly killed his infant daughter) in the high-security closed-custody unit.

On February 4, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the pattern of cases suggests that city correctional officials have been aware of a problem in which Rikers guards have acquiesced or encouraged violence among inmates.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; added that &quot;There have been at least seven lawsuits filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan accusing guards of complicity or acquiescence in inmate violence at Rikers, a complex of 10 detention facilities which, along with several other jails around the city, hold about 13,000 prisoners, most of whom are pretrial detainees. None of the seven suits has gone to trial. In the three that were settled, the city admitted no liability or wrongdoing.&quot;

===Sexual assault===

In an alleged July 2008 rape case reported by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; on August 5, 2008, the alleged victim claimed &quot;that someone entered her cell in the 1,000-bed Rose M. Singer Center while she was asleep, sometime before 6 a.m. on July 3. She says the intruder (or intruders) bound and gagged her with bedsheets and then used a dildo-like object to sexually assault her. Other inmates may have acted as lookouts during the alleged assault. The woman, who was being held on grand-larceny charges for the past three months, was discovered at about 6 a.m. by an officer and a captain who were touring the building. The officer saw her lying on her back on the floor of her cell with bedsheets wrapped around her neck, mouth, and legs. She had also been blindfolded. The incident was reported to central command at 7:30 a.m., and the woman was transported to the Elmhurst Hospital Center. Because she didn&#x27;t share a cell with anyone, a major question is how the alleged assault happened in the first place. Officials have not talked about the investigation, and there&#x27;s no word on whether any arrests have been made.&quot;

===Officer brutality===
On June 1, 2007, Captain Sherman Graham and Assistant Deputy Warden Gail Lewis were arrested by the New York City Department of Investigation (DOI) for covering up an assault on an inmate. The arrest came after both were indicted by a Bronx grand jury. It is alleged that on October 4, 2006, Graham assaulted an inmate after he refused to comply with strip searching procedures at the Robert N. Davoren Center (RNDC, C-74). The assault occurred in front of 15 correctional academy recruits in training. After the assault, Graham ordered the recruits to write on their Use of Force Witness Reports that Graham assaulted the inmate in self-defense after the inmate punched Graham. Lewis, who was Graham&#x27;s supervisor, did not intervene to stop the attack. Lewis also submitted a false Use of Force Witness Report. Charges against Graham include 16 counts of falsifying business records, 16 counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree, 16 counts of official misconduct, a class A misdemeanor and one count of attempted assault in the third degree. Lewis was charged with falsifying business records, offering a false instrument for filing and official misconduct. The investigation started when the DOI received a tip following an anti-corruption presentation at the academy in October 2006 on the day before graduation.

Graham and Lewis were found guilty on all charges by a Bronx jury on May 14, 2012. It took the jury approximately three hours to deliberate a guilty verdict. Lewis was able to retire in December 2009 with her pension. Graham was terminated from the Department of Correction following the guilty verdict. Each faced up to four years in prison, however, Graham and Lewis were both sentenced to 500 hours of community service and ordered to pay $1,000.00 in fines on August 7, 2012.

===Solitary confinement===
The New York City Department of Correction reported that in fiscal year 2012 more than 14.4 percent of adolescents detained at Rikers Island between the ages of 16 and 18 were held in at least one period of solitary confinement while detained. The average length of time young people spent in solitary confinement at Rikers Island was 43 days. More than 48 percent of adolescents at this institution have diagnosed mental health problems.

On August 28, 2014, a law was passed boosting oversight of the use of solitary confinement at Rikers Island, following intense public outcry after various abuses at the prison. The law requires the prison to publish quarterly reports on their use of solitary confinement, but did not include provisions regarding the protection of prisoners against guard brutality or limiting the use of solitary confinement as a punishment.

The solitary confinement unit at Rikers is commonly referred to as &quot;Bing&quot;, the inmates kept there known as &quot;Bing monsters&quot;.

====Kalief Browder====
Kalief Browder was accused of stealing a backpack at the age of 16. His family was unable to make his $3,000 bail, later being unable to post bail due to a probation violation. Browder was imprisoned without trial or conviction for three years, his trial postponed on numerous occasions. The case was eventually dismissed, and Browder was released in June 2013 by Judge Patricia DiMango after numerous postponements and 31 hearings in front of judges. For two of those years, Browder was held in solitary confinement or punitive segregation. He was profiled in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in October 2014 for being held for three years on Rikers Island without a trial.

In June 2015, Browder died by suicide by hanging. The conditions of his detention were widely seen as having caused his mental condition. He had multiple prior suicide attempts while incarcerated. Days after his death, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy invoked Browder&#x27;s experience in his opinion on &quot;Davis v. Ayala&quot;. On January 25, 2016, President Barack Obama wrote an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticizing the &quot;overuse&quot; of solitary confinement in American jails, basing his arguments largely on Browder&#x27;s case. He signed an executive order banning solitary confinement of juveniles in federal prisons.

===Treatment of mentally ill===
In 2014, Mayor de Blasio began to take action against the abuse by adding surveillance cameras and improving care for mentally ill prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 11/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2014, Judge Tynia Richard offered a sharp rebuke to the Department of Corrections, recommending that six correctional officers be fired. This group, led by Captain Budnarine Behari, had participated in the brutal beating of Robert Hinton, a mentally ill inmate, while he was hog-tied, because he had protested being moved from his cell by sitting down. Hinton&#x27;s fellow inmates watched as he was dragged down the hallways while hog-tied to a solitary confinement cell where he was beaten. While this ruling was one of the most severe against the Department of Corrections in many years, almost two years had elapsed between the beating and the Justice Department&#x27;s ruling, during which time the perpetrators in this attack were involved in more inmate beatings at Rikers Island.

===Treatment of LGBT inmates===
The segregated unit at Rikers for LGBT prisoners, known as &quot;gay housing&quot;, was closed in December 2005 citing a need to improve security. The unit had opened in the 1970s due to concerns about abuse of LGBT prisoners in pretrial detention. The New York City Department of Correction&#x27;s widely criticized plan was to restructure the classification of prisoners and create a new protective custody system which would include 23-hour-per-day lockdown (identical to that mandated for disciplinary reasons) for moving vulnerable inmates to other facilities. Whereas formerly all that was required was a declaration of homosexuality or the appearance of being transgender, inmates wanting protective custody would now be required to request it in a special hearing. &quot;In 2015, city corrections officials opened what was then called the Transgender Housing Unit. Many detainees didn&#x27;t know about or couldn&#x27;t get into the dorm, which could only house a few dozen, but nonetheless it was one of just a handful of such specialized facilities across the country. Three years later, spurred by LGBTQ+ advocates, the mayor&#x27;s office announced that the Department of Correction would house incarcerated people consistent with their gender identity.&quot;

&quot;Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, swept into the mayor&#x27;s office promising a pro-law enforcement agenda that included supporting the old guard that had long decided how things ran on the island. Adams replaced the reform-minded jails commissioner Vincent Schiraldi with his own pick, Louis Molina, whose administration immediately pushed out top department leaders supportive of the LGBTQ+ unit and shelved a draft policy directive aimed at getting more trans and gender-nonconforming detainees into gender-aligned housing. This institutional reversal has stranded numerous trans and gender-nonconforming detainees in dangerous, male housing units for weeks or months on end, subjecting many to egregious forms of physical and sexual violence, according to dozens of internal emails, Department of Correction records, and interviews with more than 20 people who work or live in city jails, including current and former corrections staffers, incarcerated trans women, jail guards and attorneys.&quot;

===Federal investigation===
In August 2014, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, issued a report condemning the systematic abuse and violation of prisoners&#x27; constitutional rights. Despite this and many other egregious incidents of abuse, few correctional officers have been prosecuted successfully or even removed from their positions. Also in August 2014, Bharara issued a damning report on the treatment of juvenile prisoners at Rikers. The report identified &quot;a pattern and practice of conduct at Rikers that violates the constitutional rights of adolescent inmates&quot;. The report describes the &quot;rampant use of unnecessary and excessive force by DOC staff&quot;, as well as dangers to inmates including inadequate protection from violence caused by other inmates, a culture that uses violence as a means to control inmates, and heavy use of solitary confinement (&quot;punitive segregation&quot;) for discipline. The report details the guards&#x27; frequent use of violence, including &quot;headshots&quot; (blows to the head or face), particularly in areas without video surveillance. This violence is perpetrated as punishment or retribution against the inmates, or &quot;In response to inmates&#x27; verbal altercations with officers&quot;.

===COVID-19 crisis===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, inmates at Rikers were unable to follow the safety measures suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid contracting COVID-19. Inmates, correctional officers, the DOT, and the head doctor at Rikers warned that better precautionary measures should be put in place, and that non-violent inmates should be released, making arguments in the name of public health. One inmate said, &quot;The hygiene in here is really nasty. There are roaches and mice in the dorms and rats in the hallway. It&#x27;s a good place for disease to hang out. I don&#x27;t want to be kept in here for this whole coronavirus thing. I plan to do my whole sentence, that&#x27;s fine, but this is just crazy.&quot; On March 22, 2020, it was reported that two dorms of 45 inmates each were carrying out a strike in protest of the lack of PPE, social distancing, and cleaning supplies, and demanding the release of all inmates who met the criteria specified by the Board of Correction. In summer 2020, about 2500 inmates were released from Rikers on early COVID Release. In February 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; featured an article by former inmate Michele Evans criticizing the jail&#x27;s handling of the pandemic. By October 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that as a result of staff shortages exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, inmates were virtually running the jail and lawlessness, violence and chaos reigned.

==Detainee deaths==

=== Jason Echevarria ===
On August 18, 2012, inmate Jason Echevarria swallowed a packet of powdered detergent, which had been given to inmates to clean out their cells after there was a leakage of raw sewage from the toilets. Echevarria began vomiting and complaining of severe pain. Terrence Pendergrass, the supervisor of the unit, was told by a correctional officer of Echevarria&#x27;s condition. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;... the captain told the officer not to bother him unless &#x27;there was a dead body,&#x27; the complaint said&quot;. Several correctional officers passed through his unit but he received no medical attention and was found dead in his cell the following morning. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, citing &quot;neglect and denial of medical care&quot;.

Jason Echevarria suffered from bipolar disorder and was housed in the unit reserved for mentally ill inmates. At one point, he had been placed in solitary confinement after several suicide attempts.

Terrence Pendergrass was demoted and suspended without pay, following the incident, and in December 2014, he was convicted of one count of denying Echevarria medical care, resulting in death. In June 2015, Terrence Pendergrass was sentenced to five years in prison. In November 2015, Echevarria&#x27;s family was awarded a $3.8 million settlement regarding the matter.

===Ronald Spear===
In 2012, 52-year-old Ronald Spear was awaiting trial on Rikers Island, and due to kidney failure, he was detained in the North Infirmary Command. He walked with a cane and wore a bracelet that read &quot;risk of fall&quot;. On December 19, 2012, Spear left his dormitory and demanded to see a doctor.

Brian Coll, a correctional officer, and Ronald Spear got into an altercation when Spear was told by the doctor that he could not be seen until later that day. Coll began punching Spear in the face and body. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Another officer grabbed Mr. Spear and with Mr. Taylor&#x27;s help [Byron Taylor, former correctional officer], pinned him down. The complaint says Mr. Coll kicked Mr. Spear several times in the head, and knelt down, telling him, &#x27;Remember that I&#x27;m the one who did this to you&#x27;&quot;. When a Rikers Island medical team reached Spear, he was unresponsive, and after failed attempts to revive him, he was pronounced dead. An investigation into the incident found that Coll and two other officers conspired to cover up how Spear died.

In 2016, Brian Coll was convicted of one count of death resulting from deprivation of rights under color of law, one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice, one count of obstruction of justice, one count of filing false forms, and one count of conspiracy to file false forms. He was sentenced for 30 years in prison. Byron Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of perjury for lying to a federal grand jury, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Anthony Torres pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and file false reports, and one count of filing a false report.

===Bradley Ballard===
Bradley Ballard, who suffered from schizophrenia and diabetes, was sent to Rikers in June 2013 on a parole violation for failure to report an address change. In July, he was sent to the psychiatric prison ward at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he stayed for 38 days before being sent back to Rikers.

On September 4, 2013, Ballard was locked in his cell as punishment for making inappropriate gestures at a female correctional officer. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the lawsuit said, &#x27;Not a single nurse, doctor or other medical or mental health provider entered his cell&#x27;&quot;. On September 11, Ballard died at the age of 39, having been confined inside his cell for seven days without access to his medication or medical treatment. When officers finally came to the aid of Ballard, he was naked, unresponsive, and covered in feces. His genitals were swollen and badly infected due to the result of injuries suffered after he tied a band around his penis.

According to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; some 129 inmates, 77% of whom were diagnosed as mentally ill, suffered &quot;serious injuries&quot; in altercations with prison guards over an 11-month period in 2013. These injuries were &quot;beyond the capacity&quot; of the prison doctors to treat successfully. Another &quot;Times&quot; article stated that &quot;the lawsuit said, &#x27;Rather than provide the critical care required&#x27; medical staff and correctional officers &#x27;who knew Mr. Ballard could not survive without medication, essentially stood by and watched as Mr. Ballard languished, deteriorated and ultimately died. In 2016, the city agreed to pay $5.75 million to settle the lawsuit.

===Jerome Murdough===
On February 15, 2014, Jerome Murdough, a homeless veteran in jail on an accusation of trespassing, was found dead in his cell. After being in jail for one week, he died from overexposure to heat. His cell was over 100 degrees, and he had taken prescription drugs which increase sensitivity to heat. Murdough had been complaining for hours about the heat but was ignored by prison guards. Murdough had been arrested for camping out on the stairwell of a New York Housing Authority building during the freezing polar vortex of 2014; his bail was set at $2,500. A settlement of $2.25 million occurred.

=== Rolando Perez ===
In January 2014, Rolando Perez was arrested for petty burglary and awaiting trial at Rikers. Perez suffered from a severe seizure disorder since the age of 16 and had taken medication to control his seizures ever since. Perez was being detained in solitary confinement after getting into a fight with another inmate. In a video obtained by a local television station, Perez is heard screaming for his medication. After being denied anti-seizure medication, at the age of 36, Perez was found dead due to seizure and heart problems. In 2019, Perez&#x27;s girlfriend was awarded $3.5 million in a settlement over his death.

=== Eugene Castelle ===
Staten Island native Eugene &quot;Sonny&quot; Castelle was battling an addiction to pain killers when he was arrested in Florida for heroin possession with intent to sell. This arrest was in violation of the terms of a drug-related plea agreement in New York. On November 2, 2016, Castelle was sent to Rikers and was found dead six days later, at the Anna M. Kross Center. An inmate told the &quot;Daily News&quot; that Castelle had taken a dose of methadone, using another prisoner&#x27;s prescription when he died. Castelle was vomiting and struggling to stand. Another inmate helped Castelle to &#x27;the bubble&#x27; watch post to ask for medical help. The correctional officer inside was sleeping, and angrily dismissed them both, the inmate said. The following morning, Castelle was found by a correctional officer and medical staff unresponsive and was declared dead seven minutes later.

=== Layleen Xtravaganza Cubilette-Polanco ===
Layleen Xtravaganza Cubilette-Polanco was a 27-year-old Afro-Latina transgender woman who died at Rikers Island, New York City&#x27;s main jail complex, on June 7, 2019, in solitary confinement. After a six-month investigation, the New York City Department of Investigation (DOI) and Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark found that staff members at the women&#x27;s facility left Polanco alone for up to 47 minutes, violating requirements to check on prisoners in solitary confinement in 15 minute intervals. It also found that staff members were not criminally responsible for Polanco&#x27;s death.

A video of the incident revealed that multiple staff members knocked on Polanco&#x27;s cell door and that she was unresponsive. In the presence of her unresponsive body, officers could be seen laughing. The DOI stated that officers thought Polanco was napping and that the laughter was unrelated. A wrongful death lawsuit was filed by David Shanies, the attorney for the Polanco family. Shanies claimed that records showed that Polanco&#x27;s epilepsy was &quot;well known&quot; and that she had suffered multiple seizures while at Rikers and that footage showed staff failed to provide Polanco with medical care that could have saved her life. Polanco&#x27;s death reignited conversations about banning cash bail and pretrial detention. Melania Brown, Polanco&#x27;s sister, and many others called for banning solitary confinement in New York City after Polanco&#x27;s death. Polanco was the tenth black trans woman to die in 2019.

===2021 deaths===

Conditions on Rikers Island drastically deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, due to a combination of viral outbreaks, staffing shortages, and exacerbated mental health crises among detainees. There were 15 reported deaths of incarcerated people on Rikers Island in 2021: William Diaz-Guzman, age 30; Tomas Carlo Camacho, age 48; Javier Valasco, age 37; Thomas Earl Braunson III, age 35; Richard Blake, age 45; Jose Mejia Martinez, age 34; Robert Jackson, age 42; Brandon Rodriguez, age 25; Segundo Guallpa, age 58; Esias Johnson, age 24; Isa Abdul-Karim, age 41; Stephan Khadu, age 24; Victor Mercado, age 64; Malcolm Boatwright, age 28; and William Brown, age 55. Chief Medical Officer Ross McDonald attributed recent deaths to worsening conditions of the jail since the outbreak of COVID-19, calling the situation representative of a &quot;new and worsening emergency&quot;.

<doc id="706918" wikidata="Q1070974" url="?curid=706918" title="Maotai">
<text>Maotai, or Moutai (), is a style of baijiu made in the Chinese town of Maotai in Guizhou province. Maotai is made from sorghum, a wheat-based &quot;qū&quot;, and water from the Chishui River. It uses traditional Chinese techniques of fermentation, distillation, and aging, to produce a spirit with a nutty, grainy, and savory aroma and flavor.

The most famous and best-selling brand of Maotai is produced by Kweichow Moutai, which has become the most valuable spirits brand worldwide. However, despite common misconceptions, Kweichow Moutai is not the only producer of Maotai, nor do they own any exclusive right to the name. To be classified as Maotai, it must be produced in the eponymous town and follow regulated production guidelines.

==History==
Alcohol production in Zunyi, on the banks of the Chishui River, has a long history dating back to at least the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE where there is record of Han dynasty Emperor Wu tasting and praising a goqijiu produced in Yelang. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the Tang and Song dynasties that grain-based distilled alcohols began to develop in China as a whole. 

The origins of Maotai itself, and the distilleries that preceded Kweichow Moutai, lie in the Qing dynasty after 1644. Beijing officials of the salt monopoly were stationed at an outpost in Maotai. They introduced baijiu production methods from their northerly home (Qingxiang), which were merged with the then in-use methods from neighboring Sichuan (Nongxiang). The result of this blend of techniques served as the basis for jiangxiang baijiu and more particularly for Maotai itself. The earliest explicit record of Maotai is in 1704, when in Renhuai Caozhi, a local newspaper, it was written that &quot;Moutai Village in the west of the city ranks first in the whole country for making liquor.&quot;

In 1854 during the Taiping Rebellion, the town of Maotai was destroyed and all of the distilleries reduced to ruins or abandoned completely. Nine years later, in 1863 a salt merchant from a neighboring town bought one of the abandoned distilleries, hired a retired master distiller, and resumed the production of Maotai in the newly founded &quot;Chengyi&quot; distillery and sixteen years later, in 1879, three Renhuai landlords opened the &quot;Ronghe&quot; distillery. It&#x27;s with these two distilleries that many of the techniques and profiles of contemporary Maotai were finalized. At the beginning of the 20th century, with the fall of the Qing dynasty and the birth of the Republic of China, Maotai continued to be in demand with &quot;tribute liquor&quot; being crafted at the request of the short lived Chinese leader Yuan Shikai for the occasion of his coronation as emperor. In that same year, Maotai was presented at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition and awarded a medal which spurred a rapid increase in demand for the spirit within China and in response a rapid increase of production capacity for the two distilleries. In 1929 the third distillery &quot;Hengxing&quot; was founded and it is on the foundation of these three distilleries that Kweichow Moutai was to be built.

Maotai&#x27;s importance in contemporary China has many of its roots in the era of the Chinese Civil War. It was in Zunyi, the prefectural city over the town of Maotai, that Mao Zedong became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party at the Zunyi Conference; and it was during the Long March that many Chinese troops and many of China&#x27;s future leaders, including Zhou Enlai, would gain an appreciation for Maotai. Stories from the time recount Red Army soldiers and officers enjoying Maotai both for consumption and for more practical purposes, primarily the cleaning and disinfection of the soldiers feet. In &quot;Memoirs of the Long March&quot; the author Cheng Fangwu wrote; “Because of the urgent military situation, we dared not drink much liquor. The liquor was mainly used to wipe our feet and relieve fatigue on the road. Wiping feet with the maotai is effective. Everyone praises it.&quot; In a likely apocryphal story, company commander Wang Yuenan, and one of Mao&#x27;s guards Chen Fengchan, were returning from a trip to purchase Maotai for this purpose when they ran into Mao himself who told them; &quot;Maotai is a place famous for its wine, but it would be a pity to wipe your feet with this wine!&quot; While in the town of Maotai during the Long March, the political bureau of the Red Army issued a notice to the passing soldiers to note the importance of Maotai liquor and refrain from interfering in the private distillation of the spirit ongoing except to buy or sell.

Shortly after the end of the Chinese Civil War and after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic, the three existing Maotai distilleries, Chengyi, Ronghe, and Hengxing were merged to create the modern, state-owned Kweichow Moutai in 1951.

Since the foundation of the modern Kweichow Moutai, the spirit has served as part of the standard fare for Chinese diplomatic meetings and dinners. From Mao&#x27;s gifts of Maotai given to Joseph Stalin and Kim Il-Sung in 1950 and 1973 respectively, to Zhou Enlai&#x27;s use of the spirit as a diplomatic tool for the 1954 Geneva Conference and the welcoming banquet for Richard Nixon 1972 visit to China, Maotai has served as one of the primary cultural items representing China on the international stage. Its use in these terms has become so well known that when Deng Xiaoping visited the United States in 1979, Henry Kissinger told him &quot;I think if we drink enough Moutai we can solve anything.&quot;

<doc id="706929" wikidata="Q7569711" url="?curid=706929" title="Southern California Earthquake Center">
<text>The Statewide California Earthquake Center (SCEC) is a collaboration of more than 1,000 scientists across 100 research institutions focused primarily on conducting research on earthquakes in Southern California and elsewhere by gathering data, conducting theoretical studies, and performing computer simulations; integrate information into a comprehensive, physics-based understanding of earthquake phenomena; and communicate that understanding to end-users and society at large as useful knowledge for reducing earthquake risk and improving community resilience.

SCEC headquarters are at the University of Southern California. SCEC partners with many other research and education/outreach organizations in many disciplines. Primary funding for SCEC activities is provided by the National Science Foundation and the United States Geological Survey. The current director of SCEC is Yehuda Ben-Zion.

The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) was founded as a Science &amp; Technology Center on February 1, 1991, with joint funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). SCEC graduated from the STC Program in 2002 and has been funded as a stand-alone center under cooperative agreements with both agencies in four consecutive phases: SCEC2, 1 Feb 2002 to 31 Jan 2007; SCEC3, 1 Feb 2007 to 31 Jan 2012; SCEC4, 1 Feb 2012 to 31 Jan 2017; and SCEC5, 1 Feb 2017 to 31 Jan 2022.

==Headquarters==
SCEC Headquarters are located at the University of Southern California&#x27;s University Park campus just south of Downtown Los Angeles. Administrative offices for SCEC are located on the first floor of the Zumberge Hall of Science (ZHS) on Trousdale Parkway. Other facilities in Zumberge Hall include an outreach and education office, software development and research computing office, undergraduate computer lab, office of director Yehuda Ben-Zion as well as several meeting rooms.

== Center renaming ==
As of October of 2023 the center was renamed to Statewide California Earthquake Center from its previous name the Southern California Earthquake Center under which it operated since 1991. The center acronym has remained unchanged.

==Research==
SCEC coordinates fundamental research on earthquake processes using Southern California as its main natural laboratory. Currently, over 1,000 earthquake professionals are participating in SCEC projects. SCEC’s long-range science vision is to develop dynamical models of earthquake processes that are comprehensive, integrative, verified, predictive, and validated against observations. The science goal of the SCEC core program is to provide new concepts that can improve the predictability of the earthquake system models, new data for testing the models, and a better understanding of model uncertainties. SCEC is one of three institutions (the other being the California Geological Survey and USGS) that form the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP), responsible for creating the California earthquake &quot;forecast,&quot; UCERF. The current version, with the latest forecast results, is known as UCERF3.

==Core institutions==
Core institutions involved in SCEC research include but are not limited to:

* University of Southern California (headquarters)
* California Institute of Technology
* Columbia University, Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory
* San Diego State University
* University of California,
**University of California, Davis

==Education and Outreach programs==

===Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drills===

Since 2008, SCEC has coordinated Great ShakeOut Earthquake ShakeOut Drills, a worldwide earthquake safety movement.

=== Internships: UseIT and SURE ===
SCEC currently operates two different internship programs funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Defense as well as several other institutions including the University of Southern California and the United States Geological Survey. These two programs are the UseIT program which is directed towards developing software for understanding earthquakes worldwide and the SURE program which is aimed at more focused topics of research in the Earth Sciences. The director of these two programs is Dr. Gabriela Noriega.

The SCEC UseIT (Undergraduate Studies in Earthquake Information Technology) program, unites undergraduates who are sophomores, juniors, or seniors in the coming fall, taking potentially any major, and coming from colleges and universities across the continent to participate in a leading-edge program at SCEC headquarters.

SCEC/UseIT interns work on multi-disciplinary, collaborative teams to tackle a scientific &quot;Grand Challenge&quot; posed by 2002–2017 SCEC director Dr. Thomas H. Jordan. The Grand Challenge varies each year but always entails performing computer science research that is needed by earthquake scientists or outreach professionals.

The SCEC SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) program pairs a student, one-on-one, to conduct research with a pre-eminent earthquake scientist or specialist. Many SURE interns also have the opportunity to work alongside graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and thus gain the special perspective of these early career professionals.

Started in 1994, SCEC/SURE has supported students to work in a very wide variety of fields related to earthquake science, including paleoseismic field investigations, remote sensing, risk mitigation, seismic velocity modeling, effects of earthquakes on natural resources such as groundwater, science education, information technology, and earthquake engineering.

===Earthquake Country Alliance===

The Earthquake Country Alliance is administered by SCEC and organizes many earthquake preparedness and mitigation activities around California, such as regional workshops, the Great California ShakeOut Earthquake Drill, and an microgrants program called the &quot;ECA Mini-Awards.&quot; The website, features many resources for the public. The Earthquake Country Alliance (ECA) is described by itself as a public-private-grassroots partnership of people, organizations, and regional alliances that work together to improve earthquake and tsunami preparedness, mitigation and resiliency.

<text>Roy Dean Blunt (born January 10, 1950) is an American politician and lobbyist who served as a United States senator from Missouri from 2011 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 33rd Missouri Secretary of State (1985–1993) and U.S. Representative for Missouri&#x27;s 7th congressional district (1997–2011).

Born in Niangua, Missouri, Blunt is a graduate of Southwest Baptist University and Southwest Missouri State University (now Missouri State University). After serving as Missouri Secretary of State from 1985 to 1993, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Missouri&#x27;s 7th congressional district in 1996. There, he served as Republican Whip from 2003 to 2009.

Blunt successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. The next year, he was elected vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. Blunt, who was the dean of Missouri&#x27;s congressional delegation, was elected to serve as Policy Committee chairman in November 2018. On March 8, 2021, he announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022. He was succeeded in the U.S. Senate by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt.

After leaving Congress, Blunt began working for the lobbying firm Husch Blackwell Strategies. He also joined as a member of Southwest Airlines&#x27; board of directors.

==Early life, education, and career==
Blunt was born on January 10, 1950, in Niangua, Missouri, the son of Neva Dora (née Letterman) and Leroy Blunt, a politician. He earned a B.A. degree in history in 1970 from Southwest Baptist University.

Two years later, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in history from Southwest Missouri State University. During his time in college, he received three draft deferments from the Vietnam War. Blunt was a high school history teacher at Marshfield High School in the city of Marshfield from 1970 to 1972; he later taught at Southwest Baptist University and as a member of the adjunct faculty at Drury University.

He went on to serve as president of Southwest Baptist University, his alma mater, from 1993 to 1996.

==Early political career (1972–1997)==

===Greene county clerk===
Blunt entered politics in 1973, when he was appointed county clerk and chief election official of Greene County, Missouri. He was subsequently elected to the position three times and served a total of 12 years.

===1980 lieutenant gubernatorial election===
In 1980 incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Bill Phelps ran for governor. Blunt, the Greene County Clerk, decided to run for the open seat and won the Republican primary, but lost the general election to State Representative Ken Rothman 56%–44%.

===Secretary of State===

In 1984, after incumbent Democratic Missouri Secretary of State James Kirkpatrick decided to retire, Blunt ran for the position and won the Republican primary with 79% of the vote.

In 1988, he won reelection against Democrat James Askew 61%–38%.

===1992 gubernatorial election===

Since incumbent Republican Governor John Ashcroft was term-limited, Blunt ran for the governorship in 1992. Missouri Attorney General William Webster won the Republican primary, defeating Blunt and Missouri Treasurer Wendell Bailey 44%–40%–15%. Webster lost the general election to Mel Carnahan.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1997–2011)==

In 1996 Blunt decided to run for the United States House of Representatives after incumbent U.S. Representative Mel Hancock honored his pledge to serve only four terms. Blunt ran in Missouri&#x27;s 7th congressional district, the state&#x27;s most conservative district, in the Ozark Mountains in the southwest. Blunt&#x27;s political action committee is the Rely on Your Beliefs Fund.

On August 6, 1996, he won the Republican primary, defeating Gary Nodler 56%–44%. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Ruth Bamberger 65%–32%.

===Tenure===
====Education====
Blunt voted in favor of school prayer and supported the No Child Left Behind Act. He voted in favor of school vouchers within the District of Columbia but against broader legislation allowing states to use federal money to issue vouchers for private or religious schools. He received a 17% rating from the National Education Association in 2003.

====Fiscal issues====
Blunt received a 97% rating from the United States Chamber of Commerce. He supported efforts to overhaul U.S. bankruptcy laws, requiring consumers who seek bankruptcy protection to repay more of their debts.

Blunt opposes federal cap and trade legislation and supports drilling for oil on the U.S. coastline. He does not believe in man-made global warming, stating: &quot;There isn&#x27;t any real science to say we are altering the climate or path of the Earth.&quot;

====Gun policy====
Blunt voted to prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers and dealers if the guns they manufacture or sell are later used in a crime. He has also voted to require anyone who purchases a gun at a gun show to go through a background check that must be completed within 24 hours. He has received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF).

====Health policy====
Blunt chaired the House Republican Health Care Solutions Group.

In 2006, Blunt successfully advocated for legislation that placed restrictions on over-the-counter cold medicines that could be used in the production of methamphetamines. The legislation, called the Combat Meth Act, was opposed by retail and drug lobbyists.

In August 2009, Blunt stated in two separate newspaper interviews that, because he was 59 years old, &quot;In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke my hip, I couldn&#x27;t get it replaced.&quot; He stated he had heard the statement in Congressional testimony by &quot;some people who are supposed to be experts on Canadian health care.&quot; The PolitiFact service of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; reported that it could not find any such testimony.

====Minimum wage====
Blunt voted against HR 2007-018, which raised the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour.

====Social issues====
He has voted to ban partial-birth abortions and to restrict or criminalize transporting minors across state lines for the purpose of getting an abortion. He opposes federal funding for elective abortions in accordance with the Hyde Amendment.

He voted in favor of the unsuccessful Federal Marriage Amendment which sought to place a national ban on same-sex marriage, and has voted against gay adoption. He received 94% lifetime and 96% 2004 ratings from the conservative American Conservative Union, a 14% rating from the ACLU, and a 92% rating from the conservative Christian Coalition.

====Social Security and Medicare====
In 2005, Blunt supported President George W. Bush&#x27;s proposal to partially privatize Social Security for those under the age of 55.

===Leadership===
After only one term, Blunt was appointed Chief Deputy Whip, the highest appointed position in the House Republican Caucus. In that capacity, he served as the Republicans&#x27; chief vote-counter. In 2002, when Dick Armey retired and fellow Texan Tom DeLay was elected to succeed him, Blunt was elected to succeed DeLay as House Majority Whip.

Blunt served as Majority Leader on an acting basis starting in September 2005, after DeLay was indicted on felony charges involving campaign finance. On January 8, 2006, one day after DeLay announced that he would not seek to regain his position, Blunt announced he would run to permanently replace DeLay.

On January 14, 2006, Blunt issued a release claiming that the majority of the Republican caucus had endorsed him as DeLay&#x27;s successor. But when the election was held by secret ballot on February 2, 2006, U.S. Representative John Boehner of Ohio won on the second ballot, with 122 votes to 109 for Blunt. In November 2006, House Republicans elected Blunt to their second-highest position during the 110th Congress, Minority Whip. Blunt handily defeated U.S. Representative John Shadegg of Arizona for the position. He announced he would step down from the position in late 2008, following two successive election cycles where House Republicans had lost seats, avoiding a difficult battle with his deputy, Eric Cantor, who was urged by some to challenge Blunt for the position.

===Committee assignments===
Upon entering the U.S. House, Blunt served on the House International Relations Committee, the House Committee on Agriculture, and the House Transportation Committee. In 1999, he gave up seats on the latter two committees and joined the Committee on Energy and Commerce. In addition he became a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

==U.S. Senate (2011–2023)==
===2010 election===

On February 19, 2009, Blunt announced he would seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate election for the seat being vacated by incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kit Bond. He successfully ran against Democratic nominee Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, Constitution Party nominee Jerry Beck, Libertarian nominee Jonathan Dine, and write-in candidates Mark S. Memoly, Frazier Miller, Jeff Wirick and Richie L. Wolfe.

===Tenure===
According to the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, Blunt &quot;has one of the Senate&#x27;s most conservative voting records, yet he generally avoids the confrontational, firebrand style&quot; and during his tenure in the U.S. Senate &quot;Blunt&#x27;s most significant legislative accomplishments all had Democrat co-sponsors.&quot; The Lugar Center and Georgetown&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy&#x27;s Bipartisan Index ranked Blunt the 11th most bipartisan senator in the first session of the 115th United States Congress.
Blunt was at the U.S. Capitol when Trump supporters attacked it on January 6, 2021, serving as a teller for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count certification, alongside Senator Amy Klobuchar, Representative Rodney Davis, and Representative Zoe Lofgren. Before the certification, Blunt said he would support the certification of the election, in contrast to his fellow Missouri senator Josh Hawley. While Blunt observed the deliberations over the objection to counting Arizona&#x27;s votes, led by Ted Cruz, the Capitol was breached. Along with other senators, Blunt was removed from the Senate floor to an undisclosed location as the insurrectionists moved closer to the Senate chambers. He tweeted during the attack that the &quot;violence and destruction&quot; needed to stop and that &quot;This is not who we are as a nation.&quot; Blunt stated that Trump &quot;was a part of it&quot;, referring to the insurrection.

In the wake of the attack, Blunt said he would not support impeaching Trump and that there was &quot;no time&quot; to do so. He also called it a &quot;disappointment&quot; that Democrats were considering impeachment. In an interview with &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Blunt said, &quot;the president touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.&quot;

As master of ceremonies for the inauguration of Joe Biden as president, Blunt delivered a short speech expounding the Constitution&#x27;s Preamble, noting that unlike the Articles of Confederation or the Magna Carta, it roots and establishes law and authority in &quot;We the People&quot;. Blunt remarked that the endeavor to create a &quot;more perfect Union&quot; is a continuing project and said, &quot;we are more than we have been and we are less than we hope to be&quot;.

During the 117th Congress, Blunt&#x27;s committee and subcommittee appointments are as follows.

===Political positions===
====Agriculture====
In 2013, Blunt worked with Monsanto to author a rider called the Farmer Assurance Provision, which was added into the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The rider&#x27;s language originated in an agriculture spending bill in the U.S. House.

Since 2014, Blunt has been the largest recipient of campaign contributions from Monsanto, which is headquartered in Missouri.

According to progressive news magazine &quot;The Nation&quot;, the rider &quot;curtailed already weak oversight over the handful of agro-giants that control the GMO market by allowing crops that a judge ruled were not properly approved to continue to be planted.&quot; According to Blunt, who did not add the rider to the bill but who supported it, &quot;What it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it&quot;. He later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt claimed all the amendment did &quot;was repeat authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri[culture] Approp[riations] committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn&#x27;t require the secretary to do anything that the secretary thought was the wrong thing to do. Which is one of the reasons I thought it was fine&quot;.

====Donald Trump====
In 2020, Blunt voted to acquit Trump in his first impeachment trial.

In 2021, Blunt was one of 43 senators who voted to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial.

In 2022, after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Blunt said that Trump &quot;should have turned over all the documents&quot; to the National Archives when he left office. Blunt also expressed concern over the timing of the search, citing the upcoming midterm elections.

====Economic policy====
Blunt has been opposed to raising the federal minimum wage.

On June 20, 2013, Blunt co-sponsored the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2013. The bill was intended to permanently eliminate federal estate tax and it did not pass.

On January 17, 2014, Blunt introduced a bill called the Partnership to Build America Act. If signed into law, the bill would create a special fund to pay for infrastructure projects across the United States, according to &quot;Ripon Advance&quot;.

====Energy and environment====
Blunt rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2015, he voted against a nonbinding Senate resolution stating that &quot;climate change is real and caused by human activity and that Congress needs to take action to cut carbon pollution.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Blunt has acknowledged that climate change exists, but said that the human role in it is &quot;unclear&quot;.

According to &quot;The Springfield News-Leader&quot;, &quot;Blunt has railed against the Obama administration&#x27;s proposed rules to combat global warming, which could deal a blow to Missouri&#x27;s coal-fired power plants.&quot; In 2015, Blunt sponsored an unsuccessful amendment which &quot;called on the Senate to nullify a climate change agreement in November between the United States and China in which both nations pledged to reduce their carbon emissions.&quot;

Blunt has worked to protect the coal industry and co-sponsored an amendment to urge President Obama to consult with the Senate before ratifying the Paris climate agreements. In 2017, he was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Blunt has received over $400,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2012.

In 2016, Blunt worked to block a carbon tax on emissions. He supports the expanded domestic exploration for coal and natural gas. Citing his support for agriculture and energy production, Blunt &quot;has aggressively pushed to block a rule that would allow the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate some streams, wetlands and other waters.&quot;

====Foreign policy====

In 2011, Blunt called for a no fly zone over Libya.

In 2018, Blunt rejected the CIA&#x27;s &quot;high confidence&quot; assessment that Saudi prince Mohammed bin-Salman ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime. Blunt said, &quot;we don&#x27;t quite have all the information we’d like to have yet.&quot;

In January 2020, Blunt supported the Trump administration ordering the killing of Qasem Soleimani.

In 2021, Blunt criticized the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, arguing that there was a failure to evacuate U.S. citizens and their family members.

====Gun policy====
Blunt has an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) and has been endorsed in multiple elections.

In April 2013, Blunt was one of forty-six senators to vote against the passing of a bill which would have expanded background checks for all gun buyers. Blunt voted with 40 Republicans and 5 Democrats to stop the bill, which failed to pass.

One month after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Blunt voted for two Republican-sponsored bills. The first was proposed by John Cornyn and would have enabled a 72-hour waiting period for federal authorities to investigate individuals seeking to buy guns who are listed on the terrorist watch list. The second bill, proposed by Chuck Grassley, would have expanded background checks and made it illegal for individuals with certain mental health disorders to purchase guns. Neither bill passed. Blunt voted against two Democrat-sponsored bills, both which also did not pass, including one that would have made background checks required for online gun sales and gun sales at gun shows and another that would have not allowed anyone on the terrorist watchlist to purchase a gun.

In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Blunt said he was &quot;saddened by the tragic loss of life&quot; and offered his thoughts to the victims.

In 2022, Blunt later became one of ten Republican Senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which involved a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases. As a result of Blunt supporting the Safer Communities Act hunter safety and school archery programs have come under attack by the Department of Education.

====Health policy====

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in February 2012 that &quot;Blunt introduced an amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would allow an employer to deny health services if they conflict with their &#x27;religious beliefs or moral convictions&#x27;.&quot;

Blunt said of the amendment, &quot;[W]as it an overreach when Mrs. Clinton put it in the Clinton health care plan in 1994? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an overreach at all. It doesn&#x27;t mention any specific procedure. It doesn&#x27;t even suggest the mandate should be eliminated.&quot;

In 2012, Blunt attempted to add an amendment to a highway funding bill that would allow employers to refuse to provide health insurance for birth control and contraceptives. In a press release, Blunt defended the amendment on the grounds that it protected the First Amendment rights of religious employers; the amendment failed, with 51 senators voting against it.

In July 2013, Blunt indicated that he would not support efforts to tie raising the federal debt ceiling to defunding Obamacare. In an interview on MSNBC, he expressed his opinion that Obamacare is &quot;destined to fail&quot;, but that raising the debt ceiling should not be &quot;held hostage&quot; to &quot;any specific thing&quot;.

In 2016, Senators Blunt and Patty Murray (D-WA) co-sponsored a successful $2 billion funding increase for the National Institutes of Health, the first such research increase in over a decade.

Blunt has supported legislation benefitting tobacco company Philip Morris. His wife and second wife have served as lobbyists for Philip Morris in the past.

====Judiciary====
Blunt supported Trump&#x27;s Supreme Court nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett.

In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Blunt supported an immediate Senate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death. In February 2016, Blunt rejected consideration of President Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year, opining that the &quot;Senate should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until we have a new president.&quot;

====National security====
Blunt supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated &quot;[Trump] is doing what he told the American people he would do. I would not support a travel ban on Muslims; I do support increased vetting on people applying to travel from countries with extensive terrorist ties or activity. These seven countries meet that standard. Our top priority should be to keep Americans safe.&quot;

On May 28, 2021, Blunt abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Capitol riot.

==== LGBT rights ====
In 2013, Blunt voted against Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have outlawed employer discrimination based on sexuality or gender identity. In 2022, Blunt stated his support for gay marriage, recanting his longstanding opposition, and later that year voted for the Respect for Marriage Act.

====Social Security and Medicare====
Blunt has argued for the need to reduce fraud and waste in Medicare and Social Security. He has spoken out for the need to reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. In 2016 AARP said of Blunt, &quot;He said in 2010 that he remained open to the idea of individual Social Security accounts. His position hasn&#x27;t changed, but he has maintained for years that it&#x27;s not a viable issue for anyone.&quot;

====Trade====
Blunt has been a supporter of free-trade agreements. The &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot; wrote: &quot;[Blunt] has supported a spate of free-trade agreements during his nearly 20 years in Congress, including a U.S-Singapore deal in 2003, the Central American Free Trade agreement in 2005 and the U.S-Korea agreement in 2011.&quot; After early enthusiasm, Blunt has been ambivalent about supporting the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).

==== Veterans ====
In February 2017, along with Democrat Joe Manchin, Blunt introduced the HIRE Veterans Act, legislation that would recognize qualified employers in the event that they met particular criteria designed to encourage businesses that are friendly toward veterans. These include the percentages of new hires or overall workforce who are veterans, the availability of particular types of training and leadership development opportunities, and other factors that show an employer&#x27;s commitment to support veterans after their military careers. The bill was signed into law on November 30, 2021.

===2016 election===

Blunt ran for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2016.
He won the Republican primary with 73% of the vote and faced Democrat Jason Kander in the November 2016 general election on November 8, 2016. Blunt won with 49.2% of the vote to Kander&#x27;s 46.4%.

===2020 presidential election===

On November 6, 2020, while Chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, Blunt said Trump &quot;should turn this discussion over to his lawyers&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t stop the count in one state and decide you want the count to continue in another state. That might be how you&#x27;d like to see the system work but that&#x27;s not how the system works.&quot; The previous night, Trump had alleged that Democrats were &quot;stealing&quot; the election.

The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; published an editorial criticizing Blunt and Senator Josh Hawley for not distancing themselves from the January 6 United States Capitol attack and their continued support for Trump. Both senators voted for acquittal in Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial.

==Family and personal life==
Blunt has been married twice. He married Roseann Ray in May 1967; he had three children with her: Matt, the former governor of Missouri, Amy Blunt Mosby and Andrew Blunt. All three children are corporate lobbyists. Some critics have criticized Andrew&#x27;s dual professional roles as both a lobbyist for firms that might benefit from his father&#x27;s influence and his father&#x27;s campaign manager. Matt Blunt is also a lobbyist, as is his wife. The Blunts say they are careful not to seek influence for their clients with Senator Blunt.

Blunt married Abigail Perlman, a lobbyist for Kraft Foods and Philip Morris, in 2003. In April 2006, he and Perlman adopted Charlie Blunt, an 18-month-old boy from Russia. The family lives in Washington, D.C., and also own a condo in Springfield, Missouri. Roy Blunt has six grandchildren. He is a practicing Southern Baptist.

On August 9, 2021, Blunt was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;for distinguished service to Australia&#x27;s bilateral relationship with the United States of America, in particular to the joint Free Trade Agreement&quot;.

On February 14, 2023, Blunt was elected as president of The State Historical Society of Missouri where he has been a trustee since 2005.

==ACU rating==
For 2020, Blunt received a score of 74 from the American Conservative Union. He has a lifetime rating of 85.

<text>Eucalyptus pauciflora, commonly known as snow gum, cabbage gum or white sally, is a species of tree or mallee that is native to eastern Australia. It has smooth bark, lance-shaped to elliptical leaves, flower buds in clusters of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical fruit. It is widespread and locally common in woodland in cold sites above altitude.

==Description==
&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; is a tree or mallee, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white, grey or yellow bark that is shed in ribbons and sometimes has insect scribbles. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, bluish green or , broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved or elliptical, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf s in cluster of between seven and fifteen, sometimes more, on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from October to February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; was first formally described in 1827 by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel from an unpublished description by Franz Sieber. Sprengel published the description in &quot;Systema Vegetabilium&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;pauciflora&quot; is from the Latin &quot;pauciflorus&quot; meaning &quot;few-flowered&quot;. The term &quot;pauciflora&quot; (few-flowered) is a misnomer, and may originate in an early collected specimen losing its buds in transit.

Six subspecies are recognised by the Australian Plant Census as at 30 November 2019:
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;acerina&quot; occurs in Victoria;
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;debeuzevillei&quot; in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory;
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;hedraia&quot; in Victoria;
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;niphophila&quot; in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria;
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;parvifructa&quot; in Victoria;
* &quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;pauciflora&quot; is found in Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.

==Distribution and habitat==
Snow gum grows in woodland along the ranges and tablelands, in flat, cold sites above from the far south-east of Queensland, through New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria, to near Mount Gambier in South Australia and Tasmania.

In Tasmania the species hybridises with &quot;Eucalyptus coccifera&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus amygdalina&quot;.

==Ecology==
Snow gum is amongst the hardiest of all eucalyptus species, surviving the severe winter temperatures of the Australian Alps. The species regenerates from seed, by epicormic shoots below the bark, and from lignotubers. It is the most cold-tolerant species of eucalyptus, with &quot;E. pauciflora&quot; subsp. &quot;niphophila&quot; surviving temperatures down to and year-round frosts. It has been introduced to Norway.

==Influence on snowpack processes==
At altitudes where stands of snow gum coincide with seasonal snowfall above an altitude of about , the trees have been shown to increase snowpack accumulation and moderate melt, making snow gum critically important to the hydrology and water resources of southeast Australia. Contrary to characteristics of needle-leaf forests, snow gums don&#x27;t frequently intercept large quantities of snowfall on branches and leaves such that increased evaporation or sublimation would occur. As a result, snow accumulation is greater in living snow gum forests than burned forests or unforested areas.

Bushfire impact on snow gums alters these effects and leads to reduced snowpack longevity and greater evaporation/sublimation processes, in turn reducing snowpack runoff available for ecosystem and human use. It is estimated that the 2019-2020 bushfires impacted 462 km2 (33%) of mapped snow gum forest that regularly has seasonal snowpack, which would equate to a reduction in annual snowpack runoff of 63.3 gigalitres (about 25,320 olympic swimming pools).

<text>Arnaldo Tomás Ochoa Sánchez (1930 – July 13, 1989) was a Cuban general who was executed by the government of Fidel Castro after being found guilty of a variety of crimes including drug smuggling and treason. 

==Career==
Ever since its creation, he was part of Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement, and by March 1957 he had joined Castro&#x27;s guerrilla army in the Sierra Maestra, fighting against dictator Fulgencio Batista. Ochoa played a major role in the fall of Santa Clara, becoming a close friend of Raúl Castro. Ochoa is said to have been the only survivor of the Camilo Cienfuegos loyalists sent on a doomed expedition against the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic in 1959.

He also fought against Brigade 2506 in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. E. Bovo, the Curator of the Bay of Pigs Museum, claims that he was not a commander, rather that he served under &#x27;El Gallego&#x27; José Ramón Fernández, a former officer under the Batista government.

In 1965 he became a member of the Communist Party of Cuba. Ochoa was a member of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee for more than twenty years. He attended the War College in Matanzas, Cuba, and was later sent to the Frunze Academy in the Soviet Union. In 1966 Ochoa with the Venezuelan guerrilla commander Luben Petkoff, took a boat to the shores of Falcón, Venezuela, one of his most secretive expedition. Along with 15 other Cuban military was sent by Castro to strengthen Douglas Bravo guerrillas fighting the government of Raúl Leoni that ended in a major strategic loss at large rebel cost.

Between 1967 and 1969, he trained rebels in the Congo. In 1975, Ochoa was sent to fight in a critical campaign against the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in Luanda, Angola, where he won the respect of both Soviet and Cuban commanders. In 1977 he was named commander of Cuban Expeditionary Forces in Ethiopia under the command of Soviet General Petrov. His successes during the Ogaden War impressed the Soviet commanders in the field.

By 1980, Ochoa was widely considered a great internationalist, and was awarded the title &quot;Hero of the Revolution&quot; by Fidel Castro in 1984. Within the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, Ochoa was known as Castro&#x27;s top narcotics dealer.

==Arrest and execution==
Five years later, Ochoa was chosen by Defense Minister Raúl Castro to become the head of Cuba&#x27;s Western Army. Since this branch of the military protects Cuba&#x27;s capital city, Havana, and its top leaders and installations, the position would have made him the third most powerful military figure on the island, after Commander in Chief Fidel Castro and General Raúl Castro. What was expected to be a routine background check prior to the announcement of his appointment began to unravel, however, when at appointment, the government accused Ochoa of corruption, which included, but was not limited to, the sale of diamonds and ivory from Angola and the misappropriation of weapons in Nicaragua. As the investigation continued, links were found to other military and Ministry of the Interior officials who were engaged in even more serious crimes: taking pay-offs from South American drug-traffickers, including Pablo Escobar and General Manuel Noriega in exchange for letting them use Cuban territorial waters for drug drops and pick-ups. General Raúl Castro, who was very close to Ochoa personally, later said he pleaded with Ochoa on a number of occasions to come clean, reveal everything, so they could move forward. When Ochoa refused to cooperate, on June 12, the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces announced his arrest and investigation for serious acts of corruption, dishonest use of economic resources, and abetting drug trafficking.

At dawn on July 13, 1989, Ochoa was executed by a firing squad along with three senior officers of the Ministry of the Armed Forces and Ministry of the Interior (MININT), after a military court convicted them of drug smuggling and treason. Later allegations from a former Castro bodyguard claimed that Ochoa was executed, and Interior Minister Jose Abrantes sentenced to a 20-year prison term, allegedly to cover up the Castro brothers&#x27; high-up involvement in the drug smuggling trade.

<doc id="706953" wikidata="Q534401" url="?curid=706953" title="Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite">
<text>The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was a NASA-operated orbital observatory whose mission was to study the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, particularly the protective ozone layer. The satellite was deployed from Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during the STS-48 mission on 15 September 1991. It entered Earth orbit at an operational altitude of , with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees.

The original mission duration was to be only three years, but was extended several times. When the mission finally ended in June 2005 due to funding cuts, 14 years after the satellite&#x27;s launch, six of its ten instruments were still operational. A final orbit-lowering burn was performed in early December 2005 to prepare the satellite for deorbit. On 26 October 2010, the International Space Station performed a debris-avoidance maneuver in response to a conjunction with UARS.

The decommissioned satellite re-entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 24 September 2011. Considerable media attention surrounded the event, largely due to NASA&#x27;s predictions that substantial parts of the satellite might reach the ground, potentially endangering inhabited areas. However, the satellite ultimately impacted in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.

== Instruments ==

===Chemical studies===

====Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES)====

CLAES was a spectrometer that determined the concentrations and distributions of nitrogen and chlorine compounds, ozone, water vapor and methane. This platform produced the first global maps of ozone depleting chlorinated compounds. It did this by inferring the amount of gases in the atmosphere by measuring the unique infrared signature of each gas.

In order to differentiate the relatively weak signature of trace gases from the background radiation in the atmosphere, CLAES had to have high resolution and sensitivity. To achieve this, the instrument combined a telescope with an infrared spectrometer. The whole instrument was cryogenically cooled to keep heat from the instrument from interfering with the readings. The cryogenics system consisted of an inner tank of solid neon at (−430 °F) and an outer tank of solid carbon dioxide at (−238 °F). As the neon and carbon dioxide evaporated, they kept the instrument cool for a planned 19 months. The final cryogens evaporated from the instrument on May 5, 1993, and the instrument warmed up, ending its useful life.

The instrument looked sideways out of the UARS platform to allow the instrument to look through the stratosphere and the lower mesosphere. CLAES produced a 19-month global database showing the vertical distributions of important ozone-layer gases in the stratosphere and their variation with time of day, season, latitude, and longitude.

====Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS)====

ISAMS is an infrared radiometer for measuring thermal emission from the Earth&#x27;s limb (the line of the horizon as seen from UARS), on both sides of the spacecraft. It used the pressure-modulation technique to obtain high spectral resolution, and innovative stirling-cycle coolers to achieve high detector sensitivity. ISAMS uses 7 gas cells for 6 different gases: CO2 (times 2), CO, CH4, N2O, NO2 and H2O. The CO2 cells also allow measurement of ozone (O3), nitric acid (HNO3) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5)

The specific objectives of ISAMS were: (i) To obtain measurements of atmospheric temperature as a function of pressure, from the tropopause to the mesopause, with good accuracy and spatial resolution, and hence to study the structure and dynamics of the region, (ii) To investigate the distribution and variability of water vapour in the middle atmosphere, to determine its role in the atmospheric general circulation, and its sources and sinks in the middle atmosphere, (iii) To measure the global distribution of oxides of nitrogen and hence to investigate their origins and their roles in catalytic cycles which control the amount of ozone in the stratospheric ozone layer. It also made extensive observations of volcanic aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds in the middle atmosphere. The instrument operated from September 1991–July 1992.

====Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)====
The MLS detected naturally occurring microwave thermal emissions from Earth&#x27;s limb to create vertical profiles of atmospheric gases, temperature, pressure and cloud ice. MLS looks 90° from the angle of UARS&#x27; orbit.

Thermal radiation enters the instrument through a three-mirror antenna system. The antenna mechanically scans in the vertical plane through the atmospheric limb every 65.5 seconds. The scan covers a height range from the surface up to (55 miles). Upon entering the instrument, the signal from the antenna is separated into three signals for processing by different radiometers. The radiometer measures temperature and pressure. The radiometer measures water vapor and ozone. The radiometer measures ClO, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitric acid and water vapor.

As late as June 2005, the 63 and 205 GHz radiometers remained operational, but the 183 GHz radiometer failed after 19 months of operation.

====Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE)====

HALOE uses solar occultation to measure simultaneous vertical profiles of ozone (O3), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), temperature, aerosol extinction, aerosol composition and size distribution versus atmospheric pressure at the Earth&#x27;s limb. The measurements are done at eight different wavelengths of infrared across a wide field of view of Earth&#x27;s limb.

A vertical scan of the atmosphere was obtained by tracking the sun during occultation. The scan will measure the amount of solar energy absorbed by gases in the atmosphere.

In order to support scanning, the instrument came in two parts, the optics unit on a two-axis gimbal and a fixed electronics unit. The optics unit contains a telescope that collects solar energy as well as the gas detectors. The electronics unit handles data, motor control and power for the instrument.

===Dynamics===

====High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI)====

HRDI observed the emission and absorption lines of molecular oxygen above the limb of the Earth, uses the Doppler shift of the lines to determine horizontal winds and uses the line shapes and strengths to obtain information about temperature and atmospheric make-up.

The instrument consists of two parts, the telescope and the interferometer which consists of an optical bench and support electronics.

The telescope used a narrow field of view to prevent Doppler shift variation across the field of view from distorting the results. Input from the telescope is fed to the processor via a fiber optic cable.

HRDI conducted scientific operations from November 1991 until April 2005.

====Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII)====

The WINDII instrument measured wind, temperature and emission rate from airglow and aurora. The instrument looked at Earth&#x27;s limb from two different angles, 45 degrees and 135 degrees off the spacecraft&#x27;s angle of motion. This allowed the instrument to read the same areas of the sky from two angles within a few minutes of the previous reading.

The instrument consists of an interferometer which feeds to a CCD camera. The two telescopes (45 degrees and 135 degrees) each have a one meter long baffle tube to reduce stray light during daytime viewing. The input from the telescopes is positioned side by side on the CCD so both views are imaged simultaneously.

===Energy inputs===

====Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)====

SUSIM measured ultraviolet (UV) emissions from the sun. The observations are made both through vacuum and through occultations of the sun through the atmosphere. This allowed a comparison of the amount of UV light that reaches the earth and the amount absorbed by the upper atmosphere.

Because of the energy of UV, instrument degradation is a major issue. To help with this problem, the instrument contained two identical spectrometers. One was used almost continuously during the daylight portion of UARS&#x27; orbit. The second was used infrequently to verify the sensitivity of the first.

====Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE)====
The Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment was designed to measure solar radiation. The instrument used a novel approach to calibration: instead of calibrating against an internal reference lamp, the instrument regularly took measurements of bright blue stars, which have theoretically very stable emissions over intervals on the order of the spacecraft&#x27;s operational lifetime. The instrument&#x27;s input slit was configurable for solar or stellar modes, to accommodate for the vast difference in target brightness. In addition to stars, SOLSTICE also took occasional measurements of targets of opportunity, including the moon and other objects in the solar system.

====Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor II (ACRIM2)====
The ACRIM2 instrument on the UARS satellite measured the total solar irradiance (TSI), the total solar radiant energy reaching Earth, continuing the climate change database begun in 1980 by the ACRIM1 experiment on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM). The ACRIM1 experiment&#x27;s results provided the first discoveries of intrinsic variations in the TSI and their relationships to solar magnetic activity phenomena. ACRIM experiments have confirmed TSI variation occurs on virtually every timescale from their 2-minute observation cadence to the decades-long length of the TSI record to date. A precise knowledge of the TSI and its variation over time is essential to understanding climate change. Recent findings indicate that instrinsic TSI variation has had a much larger role (up to 50%) in global warming during the industrial era than previously predicted by global circulation models (GCM&#x27;s). The profound sociological and economic implications of understanding the relative climate change contributions of natural and anthropogenic forcings makes it essential that the TSI database, a critical component of climate change research, be carefully sustained into the foreseeable future. The UARS/ACRIM2 experiment was an important part of providing the long term TSI database.
==End of mission and re-entry==

===Orbit-lowering burn===
UARS was decommissioned on 14 December 2005. The final perigee lowering burns lowered the orbit to 518 km x 381 km. They were followed by the passivation of the satellite&#x27;s systems.

On 26 October 2010, the International Space Station performed a debris-avoidance maneuver in response to a conjunction with UARS.

===Re-entry===
On 7 September 2011, NASA announced the impending uncontrolled re-entry of UARS, and noted that there was a small potential risk to the public. By 23 September 2011, the orbit of UARS had reduced to . 26 pieces of debris were expected to survive reentry and strike the surface, the largest of which had an estimated mass of , possibly reaching the surface at a velocity of (). Smaller pieces were expected to strike the surface at up to ().

At 07:46 UTC on 24 September 2011, NASA released an updated statement on the UARS website, stating that: &quot;The Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California said the satellite penetrated the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean&quot;. A precise re-entry time and location was not initially stated. Nicholas Johnson, the chief orbital debris scientist at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, stated that &quot;We don&#x27;t know where the debris field might be... We may never know.&quot; However, the Joint Space Operations Center later announced that the reentry took place at 04:00 UTC on 24 September, at , just downrange of American Samoa. According to NASA, the satellite&#x27;s debris field would extend between positions downrange, generally northeast of this position.

<text>Robert Foxworth is an American film, stage, and television actor.

==Early life==
Foxworth was born November 1, 1941, in Houston, Texas, the son of Erna Beth (née Seamman), a writer, and John Howard Foxworth, a roofing contractor. He attended Lamar High School and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting at Carnegie Mellon University.

==Career==
Foxworth first gained attention as a stage actor, particularly at Washington, DC&#x27;s Arena Stage. He was offered the role of J. R. Ewing in &quot;Dallas&quot;, but turned it down and Larry Hagman was cast.

Among his numerous film and television roles, such as in the television series &quot;The Storefront Lawyers&quot; (1970–1971), Foxworth is best known for his stints on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (he played Jane Wyman&#x27;s long-suffering nephew, Chase Gioberti, from 1981–1987) and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (he played Bernard Chenowith from 2001–2003), as well as a starring role in Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s 1974 movie &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot;. He also appeared in the episode &quot;All My Tomorrows&quot; of the NBC romantic anthology series &quot;Love Story&quot; in 1973 and in the episode &quot;The Mask of Adonis&quot; from the 1977 NBC science fiction-horror anthology series &quot;Quinn Martin&#x27;s Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Twist in the Tale&quot;). He had a guest-starring role on the seventh season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; and a guest spot on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

Foxworth played the murderer, an Army colonel, in &quot;Grand Deceptions,&quot; a 1989 episode of the TV series &quot;Columbo&quot;. He has also guest-starred in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Password Plus&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He has done voice acting as the corrupt Professor Hamilton on &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. He also voiced the Autobot Ratchet, in the film version of &quot;Transformers&quot; and its sequels.

==Personal life==
Foxworth was married from 1964 until 1974 to Marilyn McCormick, with whom he had two children, including actor Bo Foxworth. Foxworth was married to actress Elizabeth Montgomery from 1993 until her death in 1995. They had lived together for 20 years before marrying. Foxworth later married Stacey Thomas on August 2, 1998.

<text>Peter Douglas Nicholls (8 March 1939 – 6 March 2018) was an Australian literary scholar and critic. He was the creator and a co-editor of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; with John Clute.

==Early career==
Born in Australia&#x27;s state of Victoria in Melbourne, he spent two decades from 1968 to 1988 as an expatriate, first in the USA, and then the UK.

Nicholls&#x27; early career was as a literary academic, originally with the University of Melbourne. He first travelled to the USA in 1968 with a Harkness Fellowship in movie making, and has scripted television documentaries. His significant contributions to science fiction scholarship and criticism began during 1971, when he became the first Administrator of the Science Fiction Foundation (UK), a title he had until 1977. He was editor of its journal, &quot;Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction&quot;, from 1974 to 1978.

==&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;==
During 1979, Nicholls edited &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (published in the USA as &quot;The Science Fiction Encyclopedia&quot;), with John Clute as associate editor.

Most of its 730,000 words were written by Nicholls, Clute and two contributing editors. It won the 1980 Hugo Award for the Nonfiction Book category.

A completely revised, updated, and greatly expanded version of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, co-edited with Clute, was published in 1993, and won the 1994 Hugo for the same category. A further updating of the work, with revisions and corrections, was later issued in CD-ROM format. The third edition, with Clute and David Langford, was released online as a beta text in October 2011.

==Other work==
Nicholls&#x27; other major publications include: &quot;Science Fiction At Large&quot; (1976; reprinted 1978 with the title &quot;Explorations of the Marvellous&quot;), a collection of essays edited by Nicholls from a 1975 symposium; &quot;The Science in Science Fiction&quot; (1983) edited by Nicholls and written by him with David Langford and Brian Stableford; and &quot;Fantastic Cinema&quot; (1984; published in the USA as &quot;The World of Fantastic Films&quot;). &quot;Genre Fiction: The Roaring Years&quot; (2022) is a posthumous collection of his reviews and essays which he had planned, titled and written an introduction for &quot;circa&quot; 2012 but was unable to complete.

He won several awards for his scholarship, including the Science Fiction Research Association&#x27;s Pilgrim Award (1980), an Eaton Award (1995) and a Peter McNamara Award (2006). He broadcast movie and book reviews on BBC Radio from 1974 and worked as a publisher&#x27;s editor 1982–1983.

Nicholls was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease during 2000, which gradually curtailed his activities. A movie about his interest and work in science fiction, titled &quot;The What-If Man&quot;, was completed in 2004.

==Personal life==
Nicholls was the father of five children. His daughter is author and editor Sophie Cunningham. He lived in Melbourne with his wife, Clare Coney, where he died on 6 March 2018 at the age of 78.

<text>XXXenophile is an American comic book series, published by Palliard Press and later Studio Foglio. It is an anthology of short, whimsical, erotic fantasy and science fiction stories, written and penciled by Phil Foglio. Each story is inked by a different artist.

The series&#x27; general emphasis is on the enjoyment of sexuality as a playful activity. Foglio satirizes numerous plot elements of fantasy and science fiction, such as time travel, cloning, robots, deals with the devil, love potions, and geasa. It portrays a variety of sexual activities, including &quot;oral sex, anal sex, group sex, masturbation, voyeurism, double penetration, inter-racial (literally), bestiality (although generally with an animal possessing intelligence), mild sado-masochism, homosexuality (female, in every issue; male, just in the last issue), exhibitionism, sex with any number of devices, necrophilia (specifically sex with a ghost), prostitution, and various others, including some that were only possible in micro-gravity&quot;. Foglio cited rape, mind control, pedophilia, &quot;classical necrophilia&quot;, excretion, snuff porn, branding, piercing, heavy sadomasochism, and spanking as topics that he did not find appealing and would not write about. He recalls: &quot;I had a pediatrician tell me if she had a choice between a young teenage boy finding &quot;XXXenophile&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, she’d throw him &quot;XXXenophile&quot; because it teaches much healthier interactions. Of course, this particular pediatrician would not go on the record, and I would not ask her to, but it still gave me good feelings for the day&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;XXXenophile&quot; was published as a series of ten comic books from 1989 to 1995. In 1994, the contents of the first five issues were reprinted in &quot;The XXXenophile Big Book O&#x27; Fun&quot;. In 1997 and 1998, the contents of the ten issues were reprinted in the five-volume &quot;The XXXenophile Collection&quot; series; each volume contained a number of stories from the original comics (not in their original publication order) plus a new story (generally a second look at characters from an earlier story such as the superhero Orgasm Lass and her four-armed male sidekick Foreplay). The additional stories were compiled separately in a final, eleventh issue of the comic book in 1998. A sixth volume of &quot;The XXXenophile Collection,&quot; with a new 64-page story, was published in 2000. In 2004 Studio Foglio released &quot;XXXenophile Quick and Dirty&quot;, a 20-page booklet of unreleased material. The series is on hiatus on the initiative of the Foglios until their children are of appropriate age for the material.

Palliard Press published a related series, &quot;XXXenophile Presents&quot;, which presented stories by other creators, each story taking up an entire issue. There were five issues published, with stories by Julie Ann Sczesny, Colin Upton (two), and Charlie Wise (two).

==Card game==
A &quot;XXXenophile&quot; collectible card game based on the comic was also created.

In 2001 this game was reworked into a non-adult, non-collectible card game called &quot;Girl Genius: The Works&quot;, based on the Foglios&#x27; comic &quot;Girl Genius&quot;.

<doc id="706990" wikidata="Q1474127" url="?curid=706990" title="Saved!">
<text>Saved! is a 2004 American independent satirical black comedy film directed by Brian Dannelly, and starring Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Macaulay Culkin, Patrick Fugit, Eva Amurri, Martin Donovan, and Mary-Louise Parker. Its plot follows a teenage girl (Malone) at a Christian high school who has sex with her boyfriend in an attempt to &quot;cure&quot; him of his homosexuality; she becomes pregnant as a result and is ostracized by her schoolmates. Filmed in British Columbia, the film had its theatrical release on May 28, 2004. &quot;Saved!&quot; was considered a sleeper hit, grossing over $9 million domestically following a platform release through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many remarking on its blend of religious satire with elements of the contemporary teen film.

==Plot==
Devout evangelical Christian Mary Cummings is entering her senior year at American Eagle Christian High School near Baltimore. She and her friends Hilary Faye and Veronica have formed a girl group called the Christian Jewels. One afternoon, while swimming in his pool, Mary&#x27;s boyfriend Dean Withers confesses to her that he suspects he is gay. In shock, Mary hits her head, and has a vision in which Jesus tells her to help Dean. Believing Jesus will forgive her, Mary loses her virginity to Dean in an attempt to restore his heterosexuality.

Dean is sent to Christian treatment center Mercy House after his parents find gay pornography in his bedroom. The news shocks and disgusts Mary&#x27;s friends, aside from Hilary&#x27;s sardonic, paraplegic brother Roland. Mary later discovers she is pregnant with Dean&#x27;s child. Because her due date is after graduation, she opts to hide the pregnancy from her classmates and her mother Lillian, who is covertly dating the school&#x27;s principal Pastor Skip. Feeling forsaken by Jesus and saddened by her peers&#x27; reaction to Dean&#x27;s sexuality, Mary begins questioning her faith. An enraged Hilary ousts Mary from the Jewels and replaces her with unpopular student Tia. Hilary, Veronica, and Tia later accost Mary in the street and attempt to perform an exorcism on her. Mary fights back, and Hilary strikes her with a Bible.

By Christmas time, rebellious Jewish student Cassandra is the only one of Mary&#x27;s peers who has discovered her pregnancy. Mary befriends Cassandra and Roland, who are now dating, while ostracized by the rest of their peers. Meanwhile, Skip&#x27;s son, Patrick, attempts to pursue an evasive Mary, much to Hilary&#x27;s chagrin. Cassandra and Roland retaliate against Hilary&#x27;s constant harassment of them by uploading photos of a young, overweight Hilary to the school&#x27;s computer system. The following day, the school is vandalized with obscene, blasphemous graffiti. Suspecting Mary, Cassandra, and Roland, Skip searches their lockers, where he discovers empty spray-paint cans planted by Hilary, along with a sonogram of Mary&#x27;s baby, exposing her pregnancy.

Cassandra is expelled while Mary and Roland are banned from the impending prom. Skip threatens to end his relationship with Lillian if she does not send Mary to Mercy House. Meanwhile, Roland discovers the purchase of spray paint on Hilary&#x27;s credit card statement. Armed with this evidence, Mary, Roland, and Cassandra crash the prom along with Patrick, who takes Mary as his date. Hilary tries to have them ejected, but Roland confronts her with the evidence. Tia, tired of Hilary&#x27;s lies and hypocrisy, also attests her guilt to Skip, having discovered a receipt bearing Hilary&#x27;s signature.

A humiliated Hilary storms outside while Dean arrives with his boyfriend Mitch and other residents of Mercy House. They are met by Mary and Patrick in the school foyer, where she reveals her pregnancy to Dean. Skip attempts to banish the Mercy House residents, but they refuse to leave. Patrick and Mary attempt to argue with Skip, but their altercation is interrupted by Hilary driving recklessly through the parking lot and ultimately crashing into the school&#x27;s effigy of Jesus. She then tearfully expresses remorse for her behavior and is comforted by Cassandra as Mary abruptly goes into labor and is taken to the hospital.

At the hospital, Mary gives birth to a daughter. Skip arrives with flowers and contemplates going inside. As a nurse takes a photo of the group, Mary explains in a voice-over that she has concluded that life is too beautiful to be random and meaningless, and continues to believe in a higher power of some kind.

==Cast==
* Jena Malone as Mary Cummings, a quiet girl who attempts to help her gay ex-boyfriend, Dean, by giving him her virginity, unintentionally becoming pregnant.
* Mandy Moore as Hilary Faye Stockard, the leader of the Christian Jewels and initially Mary&#x27;s best friend. She is an extremely devout conservative Christian, though very self-righteous and overbearing, much to the annoyance of others. She reluctantly cares for her disabled brother, Roland, keeping him on a tight leash.
* Macaulay Culkin as Roland Stockard, Hilary Faye&#x27;s sardonic brother. He fell out of a tree as a child, leaving him a paraplegic. Unlike his sister, he does not identify as Christian.
* Eva Amurri as Cassandra Edelstein, the only Jewish girl to ever attend American Eagle. She is naturally rebellious and devious on the outside, but when she becomes friends with Mary, her true colors show in that she is actually very loyal and open.
* Patrick Fugit as Patrick Wheeler, the son of Pastor Skip, the school&#x27;s principal, and Mary&#x27;s love interest.
* Elizabeth Thai as Veronica; adopted from Vietnam by a pair of missionaries, she is the third Christian Jewel.
* Chad Faust as Dean Withers, Mary&#x27;s boyfriend at the beginning of the film. He comes out to Mary as gay.
* Martin Donovan as Pastor Skip Wheeler, the principal of American Eagle. A superficially pious and devout minister who is permanently separated from his wife, Pastor Skip tries to remain &quot;young and cool&quot;.
* Heather Matarazzo as Tia; somewhat of an outsider in the beginning, Tia takes Mary&#x27;s place in the Jewels when Mary is kicked out. 
* Mary-Louise Parker as Lillian Cummings, Mary&#x27;s mother, a widow from an early age.
* Kett Turton as Mitch, a fellow gay resident of Mercy House who becomes Dean&#x27;s boyfriend.
* Dave Rosin, guitarist of the Canadian pop-rock band Hedley, appears as the guitarist for the band playing in the prom scene.

==Production==
Director and co-writer Brian Dannelly based much of the film on things he had experienced and witnessed while attending a Baptist Christian high school. &quot;I would even go so far as to say that everything in the film is something I experienced or researched,&quot; Dannelly stated. &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to make up stuff.&quot; Though set in Maryland, &quot;Saved!&quot; was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==Release==
===Box office===
After premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004, &quot;Saved!&quot; had a platform limited release in the United States on 20 screens, beginning May 28, 2004. The film grossed $345,136 during its opening weekend, and an additional 11 screens were added the following weekend. After the film had grossed an additional $340,343 during its second weekend, its release platform expanded to 589 screens on June 11, and it reached number 9 at the U.S. box office. By the conclusion of its theatrical run in August 2004, the film grossed approximately $9 million domestically, and was considered a sleeper hit. It grossed an additional $1.2 million in foreign markets, totaling $10.1 million worldwide.

===Home media===
A DVD version of the film is available from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with commentary from Dannelly, Urban and co-producer Sandy Stern as well as commentary by Jena Malone and Mandy Moore; theatrical trailer, access to deleted scenes, and some bloopers. Olive Films reissued a Blu-ray edition of the film in 2016.

==Reception==
&quot;Saved!&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. At critics aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 61% rating of 88 positive reviews against 57 negative ones, with an average rating of 6.12/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A satirical teen comedy that, unfortunately, pulls its punches.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 and a half out of 4 stars and praised the film despite commenting that it follows formulaic tropes of other teen films, adding that it has a &quot;political message&quot;: 

Ken Fox of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film three of five stars: 

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s David Sterritt gave the film a favorable review, writing: 

Sean Axmaker of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote of the film: 

Other critics, however, criticized the film for alleged anti-Christian views. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was overwhelmingly negative on this issue, giving the film only half a star out of five and calling it the worst movie of the year.

==Stage musical==

Playwrights Horizons produced a musical version of the film in 2008. Music and lyrics are by Michael Friedman with the book and lyrics by two-time Olivier Award nominee John Dempsey and Rinne Groff. The musical opened on June 3, 2008, at Playwrights Horizons and closed on June 22, 2008. The cast included Aaron Tveit, Celia Keenan-Bolger, John Dossett, Julia Murney, Devyn Rush, Curtis Holbrook, and Mary Faber.

<doc id="706999" wikidata="Q287919" url="?curid=706999" title="Atmospheric chemistry">
<text>Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science that studies the chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and that of other planets. This multidisciplinary approach of research draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology, climatology and other disciplines to understand both natural and human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. Key areas of research include the behavior of trace gasses, the formation of pollutants, and the role of aerosols and greenhouse gasses. Through a combination of observations, laboratory experiments, and computer modeling, atmospheric chemists investigate the causes and consequences of atmospheric changes.

== Atmospheric composition ==
The composition and chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is important for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. Natural processes such as volcano emissions, lightning and bombardment by solar particles from corona changes the composition of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. 
=== Trace gas composition ===
Besides the major components listed above, the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contains many trace gas species that vary significantly depending on nearby sources and sinks. These trace gasses include compounds such as CFCs/HCFCs which are particularly damaging to the ozone layer, and H2S which has a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs and can be smelt in concentrations as low as 0.47 ppb. Some &quot;approximate&quot; amounts near the surface of some additional gasses are listed below. In addition to gasses, the atmosphere contains particles such as aerosol, which includes examples such as droplets, ice crystals, bacteria, and dust.

== History ==
The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century when chemists such as Joseph Priestley, Antoine Lavoisier and Henry Cavendish made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, researchers shifted their interest towards trace constituents with very low concentrations. An important finding from this era was the discovery of ozone by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1840.

In the 20th century atmospheric science moved from studying the composition of air to consider how the concentrations of trace gasses in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two important outcomes were the explanation by Sydney Chapman and Gordon Dobson of how the ozone layer is created and maintained, and Arie Jan Haagen-Smit’s explanation of photochemical smog. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland. 

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation, it is now seen as one part of the Earth system with the rest of the atmosphere, biosphere and geosphere. A driving force for this link is the relationship between chemistry and climate. The changing climate and the recovery of the ozone hole and the interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems are examples of the interdependent relationships between Earth&#x27;s systems. A new field of extraterrestrial atmospheric chemistry has also recently emerged. Astrochemists analyze the atmospheric compositions of our solar system and exoplanets to determine the formation of astronomical objects and find habitual conditions for Earth-like life. 

== Methodology ==
Observations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modeling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a level where we can explain the observations.

=== Observation ===
Field observations of chemical systems are essential to understanding atmospheric processes and determining the accuracy of models. Atmospheric chemistry measurements are long term to observe continuous trends or short term to observe smaller variations. In situ and remote measurements can be made using observatories, satellites, field stations, and laboratories. 

Routine observations of chemical composition show changes in atmospheric composition over time. Observatories such as the Mauna Loa and mobile platforms such as aircraft ships and balloons (e.g. the UK&#x27;s Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements) study chemical compositions and weather dynamics. An application of long term observations is the Keeling Curve - a series of measurements from 1958 to today which show a steady rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide (see also ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2). Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by satellites by passive and active remote sensing with important instruments such as GOME and MOPITT giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry. 

Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but are limited in the vertical and horizontal space they provide observations from. Some surface based instruments e.g. LIDAR can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosols but are still restricted in the horizontal region they can cover. Many observations are available online in Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases

=== Laboratory studies ===
Laboratory studies help understand the complex interactions from Earth’s systems that can be difficult to measure on a large scale. Experiments are performed in controlled environments, such as aerosol chambers, that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular atmospheric constituent. A closely related subdiscipline is atmospheric photochemistry, which quantifies the rate that molecules are split apart by sunlight, determines the resulting products, and obtains thermodynamic data such as Henry&#x27;s law coefficients.

Laboratory measurements are essential to understanding the sources and sinks of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds. Types of analysis that are of interest include both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as heterogeneous reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of aerosols. Commonly used instruments to measure aerosols include ambient and particulate air samplers, scanning mobility particle sizers, and mass spectrometers.
=== Modeling ===
Models are essential tools for interpreting observational data, testing hypotheses about chemical reactions, and predicting future concentrations of atmospheric chemicals. To synthesize and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry, researchers commonly use computer models, such as chemical transport models (CTMs). CTMs provide realistic descriptions of the three-dimensional transport and evolution of the atmosphere. Atmospheric models can be seen as mathematical representations that replicate the behavior of the atmosphere. These numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere.

Depending on the complexity, these models can range from simple to highly detailed. Models can be zero-, one-, two-, or three-dimensional, each with various uses and advantages. Three-dimensional chemical transport models offer the most realistic simulations but require substantial computational resources. These models can be global e.g. GCM, simulating the atmospheric conditions across the Earth, or regional, e.g. RAMS focusing on specific areas with greater resolution. Global models typically have lower horizontal resolution and represent less complex chemical mechanisms but they cover a larger area, while regional models can represent a limited area with higher resolution and more detail.

A major challenge in atmospheric modeling is balancing the number of chemical compounds and reactions included in the model with the accuracy of physical processes such as transport and mixing in the atmosphere. Two simpliest types of models include box models and puff models. For example, box modeling is relatively simple and may include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions, but they typically use a very crude representation of atmospheric mixed layer. This makes them useful for studying specific chemical reactions, but limited in stimulating real-world dynamics. In contrast, 3D models are more complex, representing a variety of physical processes such as wind, convection, and atmospheric mixing. They also provide more realistic representations of transportation and mixing. However, computational limits often simply chemical reactions and typically include fewer chemical reactions than box models. The trade-off between the two approaches lies in resolution and complexity.

To simplify the creation of these complex models, some researchers use automatic code generators like Autochem or Kinetic PreProcessor. These tools help automate the model-building process by selecting relevant chemical reactions from databases based on a user-defined function of chemical constituents. Once the reactions are chosen, the code generator automatically constructs the ordinary differential equations that describe their time evolution, greatly reducing the time and effort required for model construction.

Differences between model prediction and real-world observations can arise from errors in model input parameters or flaws representations of processes in the model. Some input parameters like surface emissions are often less accurately quantified from observations compared to model results. The model can be improved by adjusting poorly known parameters to better match observed data. A formal method for applying these adjustments is through Bayesian Optimization through an inverse modeling framework, where the results from the CTMs are inverted to optimize selected parameters. This approach has gained attention over the past decade as an effective method to interpret large amounts of data generate by models and observations from satellites. 

One important current trend is using atmospheric chemistry as part of Earth system models. These models integrate atmospheric chemistry with other Earth system components, enabling the study of complex interactions between climate, atmospheric composition, and ecosystems.

== Applications ==
Atmospheric chemistry is a multidisciplinary field with wide-ranging applications that influence environmental policy, human health, technology development, and climate science. Examples of problems addressed in atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, ozone depletion, photochemical smog, greenhouse gasses and global warming. By developing a theoretical understanding, atmospheric chemists can test potential solutions and evaluate the effects of changes in government policy. Key applications include greenhouse gas monitoring, air quality and pollution control, weather prediction and meteorology, energy and emissions, sustainable energy development, and public health and toxicology. Green atmospheric chemistry research prioritizes the sustainable, safe, and efficient use of chemicals, which led to government regulations minimizing the use of harmful chemicals like CFCs and DDT. 

Advances in remote sensing technology allow scientists to monitor atmospheric chemical composition from satellites and ground-based stations. Instruments such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) provide data on pollutants, greenhouse gasses, and aerosols, enabling real-time monitoring of air quality. 

Atmospheric chemistry is vital for evaluating the environmental impacts of energy production, including fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. By studying emissions, researchers can develop cleaner energy technologies and assess their effects on air quality and climate. Atmospheric chemistry also helps quantify the concentration and persistence of toxic substances in the air, including particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), guiding public health measures and exposures assessments.

<doc id="707014" wikidata="Q3024726" url="?curid=707014" title="Destiny New Zealand">
<text>Destiny New Zealand was a Christian political party in New Zealand centred on the charismatic/pentecostal Destiny Church. The party described itself as &quot;centre-right&quot;. It placed a strong focus on socially conservative values and argued that the breakdown of the traditional family was a primary cause of many of New Zealand&#x27;s problems. It announced its de-registration as a political party on 18 September 2007, and was removed from the register a month later. It did not hold any seats in Parliament.

==History==
Destiny New Zealand formed early in 2003. By June 2004 the party claimed to have around three thousand members, and indicated an intent to stand candidates in all electorates. The party took a strongly conservative stance in most policy-areas. It repeatedly criticised what it saw as the permissive nature of modern society, with Brian Tamaki saying that New Zealand &quot;has moved so far away from God that anything goes now&quot;.

The party&#x27;s political leader, Richard Lewis, spoke out strongly against the former Labour-Progressive administration of 2002–2008, saying that the nation &quot;simply cannot afford to spend another term under the dictates of an anti-marriage, anti-family and anti-Christian government&quot;. Destiny New Zealand also condemned the existence of &quot;fatherless families&quot;, saying that lack of male leadership contributed to social ills. In 2000 Tamaki reportedly stated that having female political leaders (as New Zealand had at the time) formed part of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s strategy&quot;, although Tamaki says that reports have taken his remarks out of context.

===2005 general election===
In 2004, Tamaki predicted that Destiny Church would rule New Zealand by 2008. However, in the 2005 elections, Destiny New Zealand received just over 14,000 votes (out of over two million nationwide) or 0.62% of the vote—well short of 5% threshold required to enter Parliament without winning an electorate. This was the highest vote of any party not to make it into Parliament.
Polling before the election consistently showed the party was well short of the threshold. None of its electorate candidates proved a serious factor in their respective races (Lewis had the best showing, gaining 1,111 votes for a distant third placing in Manukau East).

==Links with Destiny Church==

Some confusion exists as to how closely the Destiny New Zealand party overlapped with the Destiny Church. According to both Brian Tamaki (leader of the church) and Richard Lewis (leader of the party), the two remained quite separate, with the teachings of the church merely having inspired the party. Tamaki described the situation by saying: &quot;the way I preach has stirred something in their hearts and they&#x27;ve decided to do something&quot;, and described himself merely as &quot;a spiritual adviser&quot;. Lewis similarly denied that the church controlled the party. Others, including several former church members, see this paradigm as just an illusion, and say that Lewis actually just served as a &quot;frontman&quot; for Tamaki. Groups such as Cultwatch, a multi-denominational Christian group that targets what it perceives as cults, have attacked the party and the church. The church and the party dismissed these criticisms as merely attempts to undermine the movement.

== Deregistration, stalled merger, and successors ==
On 18 September 2007, Brian Tamaki announced that Destiny New Zealand would be deregistered as a political party. In its place, a new Christian political party would be formed, with Richard Lewis as the co-leader. The second co-leader was not announced. However, then-MP for The Kiwi Party Gordon Copeland announced that he was the other co-leader of the party. On 20 September Copeland announced that he &quot;could not work&quot; with Richard Lewis, and would remain an independent MP. In October, it was announced that Destiny New Zealand would put its support behind The Family Party, to be led by Lewis and former United Future MP Paul Adams. The Family Party contested the 2008 election without success and was disbanded in 2010.

In 2019, Hannah and Brian Tamaki announced a new party, initially called Coalition New Zealand then renamed as Vision NZ. Brian Tamaki founded another party called Freedoms New Zealand in 2022.

<doc id="707019" wikidata="Q5060474" url="?curid=707019" title="Central Bucks School District">
<text>The Central Bucks School District (CBSD) is a school district located in Pennsylvania and the third-largest school district in the state. The district covers the Boroughs of Chalfont, Doylestown and New Britain and Buckingham Township, Doylestown Township, Plumstead Township, Warrington Township, Warwick Township, and most of New Britain Township, in Bucks County. More than 3,000 staff serve more than 17,000 students in fifteen elementary schools, five middle schools, and three high schools. There is a 99% graduation rate and over 280 extracurricular activities. Dr. Steven Yanni serves as Acting Superintendent.

== History ==

There were partisan political conflicts in the district during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania; it is located in Bucks County, which is a swing county in terms of American politics. In 2023, the school board elections resulted in candidates aligned with the Democratic Party taking the entirety of the school board.

The school board has created a realignment plan. Their goals are to introduce full-day kindergarten, shift elementary schools from K-6th to K-5th, shift middle schools from 7-9th to 6th-8th, and shift high schools from 10-12th to 9-12th.

<text>The Clio Awards, also simply known as The Clios, is an annual award program that recognizes innovation and creative excellence in advertising, design, and communication, as judged by an international panel of advertising professionals. The awards are presented by Evolution Media. 

The Clios has several awards programs alongside the larger Clio Awards that recognize creative marketing efforts in specific industries: Clio Cannabis, Clio Entertainment, Clio Fashion &amp; Beauty, Clio Health, Clio Music, and Clio Sports. One work in each media type may be awarded the Grand Clio, the highest honor.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine, in 1991, described the event as the world&#x27;s most recognizable international advertising awards.

==History==
The awards, founded by Wallace A. Ross in 1959, are named for the Greek goddess Clio, the mythological Muse known as &quot;the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments.&quot;

Originally presented by the American Radio and TV Commercials Festival, the parent company for the Clios, also founded and directed by Ross, the first Clios were awarded in 1960 for excellence in U.S. television advertising. Each winner received a gold Georg Olden–designed statuette. The competition was expanded to include work on international television and cinema in 1966, and then U.S. radio ads in 1967.

=== 1970s–1980s ===

The Clio Awards were acquired by Bill Evans in 1971 for US$150,000 () and became a &quot;for profit&quot; company. Over the next two decades the company&#x27;s income grew to $2.5 million per year, derived primarily from Clio nomination fees, of $70 to $100 per entry.

Evans expanded competition by including U.S. print advertising in 1971, international print advertising in 1972, international radio advertising in 1974, U.S. packaging design in 1976, international packaging design and U.S. specialty advertising in 1977, U.S. cable in 1983, and Hispanic competition in 1987.

The rules for the 1984 award required that a given entry appear publicly during the calendar year in 1983. In order to be eligible, Chiat/Day needed to run Apple Computer&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; commercial (directed by Ridley Scott) for the Macintosh computer prior to Super Bowl XVIII. In December 1983, Apple purchased time on KMVT in Twin Falls, Idaho, after the normal sign-off, and recorded the broadcast in order to qualify.

In 1984, a nearly identical situation occurred when Doyle Dane Bernbach, the ad agency for Ziebart, purchased time on a Detroit channel carrying the inaugural Cherry Bowl college football game in December in order for Ziebart&#x27;s &quot;Friend of the Family (Rust in Peace)&quot; commercial to be eligible for the awards the following year. The commercial won the Clio Award in 1985.

The 1988 awards were aired on television on FOX and hosted by David Leisure on December 7, 1988.

=== 1990s ===
==== 1991 Clio Awards ====
Attendees of the 1991 Clio Awards who had paid the $125 admission price did not have tickets waiting at the door, as promised. Also missing was Clio President Bill Evans.

The caterer of the event announced that the master of ceremonies was considered a no-show, but that he would attempt to stand in as the host. He informed the audience that the winners list had been lost. Print ads were the first awards; transparencies of the winning entries were displayed, sometimes backwards or out of focus. As each image appeared on screen, the owner of the work was asked to come to the stage, pick up their Clio, and identify themselves and their agency. Eventually, advertising executives, intent on the Clios that remained, rushed the stage and grabbed any that had not been claimed.

The event for television commercials, scheduled a few days later, was called off.

==== 1992 bankruptcy ====
On March 17, 1992, Clio Enterprises Inc., filed for bankruptcy, claiming $1.8 million in debts and indeterminate assets of at least $1 million. Chicago publisher Ruth Ratny purchased the Clio name for an undisclosed figure. Evans had wanted $2 million, and trade publications reported a sale price of $10,000, which Ratny called low. Ratny reorganized the event as the New Clio Awards, and combined what had previously been two events into a single presentation, which was delayed from June until September 1992. &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine reported 6,000 entries, less than one quarter of the 1990 total. As a concession to the 1991 winners who had not yet received the trophies, their entry fee was waived. The 1990 award show at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts drew 1,800, while only 500 paid for the 1992 show at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which was hosted by Tony Randall. A total of 86 awards in 73 categories were handed out. Another major change with the &quot;New&quot; Clios was direct competition between U.S. and foreign firms, which resulted in Swiss agency Comsult/Advico Young &amp; Rubicam being named the winner of the best Television campaign.

A bankruptcy court ruled that the creditors of the 1991 Clio Awards should be paid. At the time, Ratny lacked the financial resources to settle the $600,000 debt. Another Chicagoan, former film editor James M. Smyth, put up the money and became sole owner of the Clio Awards. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1992, Smyth began working on the 1993 show. The award ceremony was again delayed until September, and Jay Chiat of TBWA\Chiat\Day, Rick Fizdale from Leo Burnett Worldwide and Keith Reinhard at DDB Worldwide joined the Clio Executive Committee.

In 1997, the Clios were sold to Dutch-owned company VNU Media; Andrew Jaffe at &quot;Adweek&quot; managed the acquisition.

=== 2000s ===
In 2007, VNU changed its name to the Nielsen Company.

In 2009, e5 Global Media assumed control of Clio, when it acquired magazines &quot;Adweek&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;, among others, from Nielsen Business Media.

In 2010, Nicole Purcell was appointed executive director of Clio and Brooke Levy was hired to run marketing for the organization. In 2015, Purcell was promoted to president.

In 2014, the Clio Awards absorbed &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s Key Art Awards (created in 1971 by Tichi Wilkerson) to celebrate marketing and communications in the entertainment business. In 2017, it was renamed the Clio Entertainment Award.

In 2020, the Clios were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Description==
The Clios are an annual award program that recognizes innovation and creative excellence in advertising, design, and communication, as judged by an international panel of advertising professionals.

===Judging===
In 2007, Clio stated that the competition received more than 19,000 entries from all over the world and enlisted a jury of more than 110 judges from 62 countries. Nearly two-thirds of the submissions came from outside the United States.

In 2014, Clio assembled a 50/50 male-female jury, of which 75% were international (non-US) judges. 2014 was also the year Clio began holding judging sessions internationally. The 2014 session took place in Malta, and the 2015 session in Tenerife, Spain.

According to the Clio Awards website, more than 80% of submissions are eliminated within the first two rounds. Juries then determine whether a work deserves to be included on the Shortlist, or receive a Bronze, Silver, or Gold medal. One work in each media type may be awarded the Grand Clio, the highest honor.

<doc id="707035" wikidata="Q2301770" url="?curid=707035" title="The Skeptics Society">
<text>The Skeptics Society is a nonprofit, member-supported organization devoted to promoting scientific skepticism and resisting the spread of pseudoscience, superstition, and irrational beliefs. The Skeptics Society was co-founded by Michael Shermer and Pat Linse as a Los Angeles-area skeptical group to replace the defunct Southern California Skeptics. After the success of its &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, introduced in early 1992, it became a national and then international organization. Their stated mission &quot;is the investigation of science and pseudoscience controversies, and the promotion of critical thinking.&quot;

==History==
In late 1991, the Skeptics Society was co-founded by Michael Shermer and Pat Linse, in Los Angeles with the assistance of Kim Ziel Shermer. For the first five years, Shermer and Linse worked on the Skeptics Society out of Shermer&#x27;s garage. The Skeptic Society formed after a scandal forced an earlier group known as the Southern California Skeptics to dissolve.

In 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Shermer, Linse, and Ziel Shermer walked on a bed of hot coals in Altadena, California in a demonstration to show that their ability was natural rather supernatural in origin. By 2000, Shermer stated that the Society&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Skeptic&quot;, had a circulation of 40,000. As of 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Society itself had 50,000 members.

Shermer stated as context for the founding of Skeptic Society:The modern skeptical movement is a fairly recent phenomenon dating back to Martin Gardner’s 1952 classic, &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;. Gardner’s copious essays and books over the past four decades debunking all manner of bizarre claims, coupled to James “the Amazing” Randi’s countless psychic challenges and media appearances throughout the 1970s and 1980s (including 36 appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;), pushed the skeptical movement to the forefront of public consciousness. The philosopher Paul Kurtz helped create dozens of skeptics groups throughout the United States and abroad, and his Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) inspired me to found the Skeptics Society and Skeptic magazine...Explaining the organization&#x27;s name, the Society states:Some people believe that skepticism is the rejection of new ideas, or worse, they confuse &#x27;skeptic&#x27; with &#x27;cynic&#x27; and think that skeptics are a bunch of grumpy curmudgeons unwilling to accept any claim that challenges the status quo. This is wrong. Skepticism is a provisional approach to claims. It is the application of reason to any and all ideas—no sacred cows allowed. In other words, skepticism is a method, not a position. Ideally, skeptics do not go into an investigation closed to the possibility that a phenomenon might be real or that a claim might be true. When we say we are &#x27;skeptical,&#x27; we mean that we must see compelling evidence before we believe.

==Activities==
===&quot;Skeptic Magazine&quot;===
The Skeptics Society publishes &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, a quarterly magazine that examines fringe science and paranormal claims, available by subscription or on major newsstands in the U.S. and Canada. Its cover stories have included examination of alleged UFOs in religious icons, theories of the likelihood of artificial intelligence, and tributes to its role models such as Isaac Asimov and Ernst Mayr. Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as intelligent design and alternative medicine. The Skeptics Society also publishes &quot;eSkeptic&quot;, a weekly email newsletter on skeptical topics. The society hosts a website with information on skepticism-related topics and provides information to the media about such topics.

===&quot;Junior Skeptic&quot;===
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers&#x27; section called &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; which first appeared in 2000 in volume 6, #2 of &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine. &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.
The editor of &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; is Daniel Loxton, who writes and illustrates most issues. 

=== Skeptic Research Center ===
The Skeptic Research Center (SRC) launched in July 2020 as a way to survey peoples&#x27; attitudes about divisive issues. The results of each survey study are released through a series of brief reports (i.e., digestible single-topic analyses) through eSkeptic and on the Skeptic website. As of November 2021, the SRC has released 19 reports and the center’s work has been cited in &quot;the Wall Street Journal&quot; and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research.

===Podcasts===

The Skeptics Society distributes two podcasts, &quot;Skepticality&quot; and MonsterTalk. &quot;Skepticality&quot;, adopted as the group&#x27;s official podcast, promotes critical thinking and science. It was listed by iTunes as a top-rated audio talk show in 2016. Each episode is an audio magazine featuring regular segments by contributors who are specialized in specific areas of critical thought followed by featured content which is, usually, in the form of an interview with a researcher, author, or individual who is helping promote skeptical thought and/or science.
MonsterTalk is a podcast that critically examines the science behind cryptozoological (and legendary) creatures, such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, or werewolves. Hosted by Blake Smith and Dr. Karen Stollznow, MonsterTalk holds interviews with scientists and investigators. It received &quot;The Best Fact Behind Fiction&quot; award in 2012 from the Parsec Awards.
=== Blogs ===

Until 2014, the Skeptics Society&#x27;s blog was Skepticblog. In 2014, they started their new blog called INSIGHT, with the editor as Daniel Loxton.
=== Lecture series ===
The Skeptics Society sponsors a lecture series at the California Institute of Technology. The Caltech Lecture Series offers speakers on a wide range of topics relating to science, psychology, social issues, religion/atheism, skepticism, etc. Past speakers include Julia Sweeney, Richard Dawkins, Philip Zimbardo, Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, Steven Pinker, Carol Tavris, and Sam Harris. The lectures occur on Sunday afternoons, and are open to the public for a nominal fee. 

The Skeptics Society hosted the &quot;Origins Conference&quot; in October 2008 with Nancey Murphy, Hugh Ross, Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Paul Davies, Stuart Kauffman, Christof Koch, Kenneth R. Miller, Donald Prothero, and Victor J. Stenger. 

On 24–26 June 2011 the organization also hosted the Science Symposium, speakers included: Michael Shermer, James Randi, Bill Nye the Science Guy and Mr. Deity (Brian Keith Dalton). 

On 29–31 May 2015 Skeptic Society hosted In the Year 2525: Big Science, Big History, and the Far Future of Humanity. Speakers included: Richard Dawkins, Jared Diamond, Lawrence Krauss, Esther Dyson, John McWhorter, Ian Morris, Carol Tavris, Gregory Benford, David Brin, Michael Shermer, and Donald Prothero.

=== Reading Room ===
The Reading Room is a library containing a growing index of articles, reviews and opinion editorials culled from their archives, offering a look into the subjects the Skeptics Society has explored over the years. 

=== School curriculum resources ===
The Curriculum Resource Center is a free repository of resources for teaching students how to think skeptically.

<doc id="707039" wikidata="Q5158173" url="?curid=707039" title="Conan the Librarian">
<text>Conan the Librarian is a parody of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; that has become a literary trope, and has appeared in various media, including film, radio, television, comics, and fan fiction. Based on the similarity in the sound of the word &quot;librarian&quot; to &quot;barbarian&quot;, and their near opposite meanings, the phrase is a parodic coinage, and its origins and recurrence are likely due to both independent invention and imitation. There is no evidence that the character has an origin in 
&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; in the 1970s.

The trope has received criticism from author and librarian Ashanti White for perpetuating the stereotype of the &quot;cantankerous librarian&quot;, noting that the image was prominent in a Google Image search. The term has also been used as a descriptor both favorably and unfavorably by outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Appearances==
This listing is not exhaustive.

===Television===
*&quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; (1982). Conan the Librarian was featured on the comedy show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; in the 1982 episode &quot;Heroes&quot;.
*&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; (1986). Conan the Librarian (voiced by Eric Bogosian) appears in a sketch on a 1986 episode (&quot;Alistair in Outer Space&quot;) of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;. Unlike the &quot;UHF&quot; Conan (see below), Conan the Librarian is helpful and shows someone how to get a library card. This character was later the subject of a proposed television pilot.

===Radio===
*&quot;The Frantics&quot; (1983). The Canadian comedy troupe The Frantics featured Conan the Librarian in the lead sketch of &quot;Frantic Times&quot; show #51, &quot;Roman Numerals&quot;, broadcast on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Variety Tonight&quot; programme in February, 1983. Conan was portrayed as a fierce warrior &quot;roaming the wastelands between fiction and non-fiction&quot;, who slaughters a client for having a book overdue.

===Comics===
*&quot;Conan the Librarian&quot; (1980) The first printed appearance of Conan the Librarian may have been in the September 15, 1980 in Venue Magazine, at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University). Art by Mark Drossman, story by Bob Minadeo. It was reprinted in 1982 in the Henry Holt &amp; Company collection of college humor from the 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;Hellbent on Insanity&quot;.
*&quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot; (1987). Probably the next printed Conan the Librarian appearance is in a 1987 &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot; comic. Ham the pig, returning a book to the &quot;Overdue Books&quot; section, gazes apprehensively across the desk at a scowling and muscle-bound librarian, in typical Conan the Barbarian dress, but identified as &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot; by the placard on the desk.

===Film===
*&quot;UHF&quot; (1989). Conan the Librarian also appears in a brief segment of the 1989 &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic film &quot;UHF&quot;. Portrayed by Roger Callard, the exaggeratedly muscular character speaks in Austrian-accented English patterned after Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s portrayal of Conan. He chastises a library patron for not knowing the Dewey Decimal System, and slices a patron in two for returning a book overdue.

===Fan fiction===
*&quot;Hadley V. Baxendale&quot; (1987). In 1987, William Mitchell College of Law library staff created the character Conan the Librarian for a talent show performance and subsequently wrote &quot;The Adventures of Conan the Librarian&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Return of Conan the Librarian&quot; and &quot;Conan the Librarian on the Information Highway&quot;. The author of these stories is the fictitious &quot;Hadley V. Baxendale&quot; (a pun on the famous law case &quot;Hadley v. Baxendale&quot;). This Conan is an ordinary librarian who lives in the mythical &quot;Information Age&quot;.

===Software===
*&quot;Conan The Librarian, the OpenVMS HELP tool&quot; (2002). Mark Daniel wrote a script known as Conan the Librarian that makes OpenVMS Help and Text libraries accessible in the hypertext environment. It also provides a keyword search facility, both from a search dialog on relevant pages, and using a URL query string.

===People===
* Librarian John Szabo earned the nickname &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot; due to his fierce style in running the library in his East Quad residence hall.

==Variations==
*&quot;Colin the Librarian&quot; (1993). A variation of the character called &quot;Colin the Librarian&quot; was created by Rich Parsons and Tony Keaveny for their novel &quot;Colin the Librarian: The Chronicles of Ancient Threa - Volume 3 or Maybe Volume 4&quot; (London : Michael O&#x27;Mara, 1993). A different Colin the Librarian later appeared in the juvenile novel &quot;Colin the Librarian&quot; by Merv Lambert (Luton: Andrews UK Limited, 2012).
*&quot;Dr. Conan T Barbarian&quot; (2011). In higher academia rather than librarianship. Full name: Dr. Conan T Barbarian, BA (Cimmeria) PhD. (UCD). FTCD (Long Room Hub Associate Professor in Hyborian Studies and Tyrant Slaying). In 2011 a faculty profile for Dr. Conan T Barbarian appeared on the Trinity College Dublin School of English website. In his academic history it was said that his PhD was entitled &#x27;To Hear The Lamentation of Their Women: Constructions of Masculinity in Contemporary Zamoran Literature&#x27; and that he had earned his position by &#x27;successfully decapitating his predecessor during a bloody battle which will long be remembered in legend and song&#x27; in 2006. The entry was removed by the college administration on September 14, 2011, after a day of being viewable on the website.

<text>Serializer.net was a webcomic subscription service and artist collective published by Joey Manley and edited by Tom Hart and Eric Millikin that existed from 2002 to 2013. Designed to showcase artistic alternative webcomics using the unique nature of the medium, the works on Serializer.net were described by critics as &quot;high art&quot; and &quot;avant-garde&quot;. The project became mostly inactive in 2007 and closed alongside Manley&#x27;s other websites in 2013.

==Concept==

Just prior to Serializer&#x27;s launch in 2002, webcomics publisher Joey Manley described the site to &quot;Wired&quot; as a showcase for alternative webcomics &quot;designed to provoke thought, to challenge assumptions and exercise the aesthetic sense.&quot; Manley stated that he wanted the artists on Serializer to &quot;do everything and anything that the best novelists, the best filmmakers, the best poets and painters are able to do and, because of the unique nature of the form, to do some things that those artists, working in those other forms, can&#x27;t do.&quot; When the site launched, the most recent webcomic pages and strips were free, and the website&#x27;s archives were available for a subscription fee of $2.95 USD per month. This subscription model was revolutionary at the time, and was one of the first profitable subscription models for webcomics. A few webcomics on Serializer were also available for direct purchase via the BitPass micropayments system.

Some of Serializer&#x27;s comics used award-winning infinite canvas techniques, using the potentially limitless space available on the web to create comics that would be impossible to fit on standard print comics pages. In 2004, Hart noted that Serializer.net excited him specifically as an online venture, and that he was not interested in whether any of the works on it would wind up in print.

==History==
Joey Manley and Tom Hart launched Serializer.net on October 1, 2002. It was the first expansion of the Modern Tales family of webcomic subscription services. In 2003, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported Serializer.net was publishing work by 25 independent cartoonists. In 2004, several Serializer artists&#x27; comics were included in the &quot;Modern Tales’ 2003 Yearbook, Tallscreen Edition,” a 130-page full-color printed book of comics originally from the Modern Tales family of websites.

Serializer.net went down due to a server crash in 2006, but relaunched later that year with a new roster of around twenty artists and with Eric Millikin, one of the website&#x27;s original artists, as editor. Activity on Serializer mostly died down in 2007, as Manley was merging the Modern Tales family of websites into a new comics-oriented social media and publishing platform called ComicSpace. The collective Modern Tales family closed down in April 2013, and Manley died of pneumonia later that year.

==Webcomics==
Serializer.net launched with a webcomic collaboration between Hart and Shaenon K. Garrity titled &quot;Trunktown&quot;, as well as &quot;The Salon&quot; by Nick Bertozzi, &quot;Half Empty&quot; by Derek Kirk, and the long-running &quot;Few and Far Between&quot; by Joda Thayer. Some other webcomics published by Serializer included:

*Matt Bors&#x27; &quot;Idiot Box&quot;
*Joey Comeau and Emily Horne&#x27;s &quot;A Softer World&quot;
*Matt Feazell&#x27;s &quot;Cynicalman, America&#x27;s Laid-Off Superhero&quot;
*Renée French&#x27;s &quot;Micrographica&quot;
*Eric Millikin&#x27;s &quot;Fetus-X&quot;
*Ryan North&#x27;s &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;
*Jen Sorensen&#x27;s &quot;Slowpoke&quot;
*Spike Trotman&#x27;s &quot;Templar, Arizona&quot;
*Drew Weing&#x27;s &quot;Pup&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described Serializer as &quot;high-art,&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; considered the webcomics on Serializer to be avant-garde. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called Serializer.net artists such as Brian Sendelbach, Glenn Dakin, Greg Stump, and Nick Bertozzi as &quot;art comics favorites.&quot;

<doc id="707043" wikidata="Q7534655" url="?curid=707043" title="Skeptic (American magazine)">
<text>Skeptic, colloquially known as Skeptic magazine, is a quarterly science education and science advocacy magazine published internationally by The Skeptics Society, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting scientific skepticism and resisting the spread of pseudoscience, superstition, and irrational beliefs. First published in 1992, the magazine had a circulation of over 40,000 subscribers in 2000.

== History, format and structure ==
The magazine was co-founded in late 1991 by Michael Shermer and Pat Linse as they formed the Skeptics Society. The magazine was first published in early 1992. It is published through Millennium Press.
As of July 2021, Shermer remained the publisher and editor-in-chief of the magazine. The magazine&#x27;s co-publisher and art director was Pat Linse, until her death in July 2021. Other noteworthy members of its editorial board include, or have included, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, Pulitzer Prize-winning scientist Jared Diamond, magician and escape artist turned educator James “The Amazing” Randi, actor, comedian, and &quot;Saturday Night Live &quot; alumna Julia Sweeney, professional mentalist Mark Edward, science writer Daniel Loxton, Lawrence M. Krauss and Christof Koch.
&quot;Skeptic&quot; has an international circulation with over 40,000 subscriptions and is on newsstands in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe, Australia, and other countries.

The cover story of the magazine&#x27;s first issue paid tribute to scientist and science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov.
 According to Shermer, Asimov died when the issue was going to print, so artist Linse produced a pencil portrait of the author. As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term &quot;robotics&quot;, the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a robot sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as creationism, pyramid power, Bigfoot, pseudohistorical claims (as in the examples of Holocaust denial and extreme Afrocentrism), the use or misuse of theory and statistics, conspiracy theories, urban myths, witch-hunts, mass hysterias, genius and intelligence, and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving protosciences at the leading edge of established science, and even fads like cryonics and low-carb diets. In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:
* sponsors lecture series at the California Institute of Technology
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as SkeptiCamp) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: James Randi wrote &quot;&#x27;Twas Brillig…&quot;, Harriet A. Hall wrote &quot;The Skep Doc&quot; and Karen Stollznow wrote &quot;Bad Language&quot;.
The magazine&#x27;s page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011). , the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and Carol Tavris.

In 2021, the magazine&#x27;s 100th edition, Vol. 26 No. 2 included a retrospective of over 40 years of &quot;Skeptic&quot; artwork and covers by Linse and Loxton.

=== Topics ===
Each issue features an editorial. In the past this was provided by James Randi, and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the ABC newsmagazine &quot;Primetime Live&quot; featuring a Brazilian faith healer, João Teixeira. Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged dowsers, alleged psychics like Sylvia Browne, and UFOs.

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called &quot;Forum&quot;. This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from professionals, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. Cover stories have ranged from examination of alleged UFOs in religious icons and theories of the likelihood of artificial intelligence to tributes to influential skeptics including Isaac Asimov and Ernst Mayr. Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as intelligent design.

=== &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; ===

Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers&#x27; section called &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot;. Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

Daniel Loxton is the Editor of &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot;. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of &quot;Junior Skeptic&quot; appeared in volume 6, #2 of &quot;Skeptic&quot; (2000).

== Official podcasts ==
In April 2006, an independent, skeptical talk program called &quot;Skepticality&quot; was relaunched as &quot;Skepticality: The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine&quot;. New episodes of the show are released on a biweekly basis. The show is produced by the original, continuing show hosts (Robynn McCarthy and Derek Colanduno) in collaboration with staff of &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine.

In 2009, a second official podcast was added. &quot;MonsterTalk&quot; critically examines the science behind cryptozoological and legendary creatures, such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and
werewolves. &quot;Monster Talk&quot; is hosted by Blake Smith and Karen Stollznow, and previously Ben Radford. Blake Smith produces the show.

== Collections ==
* &quot;Paranormal Claims: A Critical Analysis&quot;, 2007, edited by Bryan Farha, University Press of America, . Several of the chapters are reprints of &quot;Skeptic&quot; articles.
* &quot;The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot;, a collection of articles that discuss the Skeptics Society&#x27;s scientific findings of investigations into popular pseudoscientific and supernatural claims.

==Editorial board==
The editorial board is composed of the following people:

<text>Ethan () the Ezrahite, is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. Ethan was a boy at King David&#x27;s court well known for his wisdom. He authored : this Psalm is entitled &quot;a &quot;maschil&quot; or contemplation of Ethan the Ezrahite&quot;. Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon theorised that this was the same person as Jeduthun. Theologian John Gill refers to a Jewish tradition which identifies Ethan with Abraham, Heman with Moses, and Chalcol with Joseph. 

Ethan means &quot;strong and optimistic, solid and enduring, permanent&quot;. The name Ethan appears eight times in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 4:31, Psalm. 89 title, 1 Chronicles. 2:6 and 2:8, 1 Chronicles. 6:42 and 6:44, and 1 Chronicles. 15:17 and 15:19).

He was a standard of wisdom to whom King Solomon is compared favorably. Called there &quot;Ethan the Ezrahite,&quot; to whom the title of Psalm 89 ascribes the authorship of that poem.

A &quot;son of Kishi&quot; or &quot;Kishaiah,&quot; of the Merarite branch of Levites, and also, with Heman and Asaph, placed by King David over the service of song (1 Chronicles 6:44; 1 Chronicles 15:17, 19).

An ancestor of Asaph of the Gershonite branch of the Levites (1 Chronicles 6:42).

==In literature==
Ethan is the protagonist and narrator of Stefan Heym&#x27;s 1973 historical novel &quot;The King David Report&quot;. As depicted by Heym, Ethan is commissioned by the newly enthroned King Solomon to write an official history of his father, King David. Ethan meets and interviews many persons who were associated with David at various periods of the late King&#x27;s life. However, much of the material gathered by Ethan gets censored out for political reasons by Solomon and his ministers; the royally-approved surviving portions of Ethan&#x27;s report eventually get into the Bible, forming the later chapters of the Books of Samuel and the early ones of the Books of Kings. Heym clearly used the biblical setting as a metaphor for his own situation as a writer in East Germany&#x27;s Communist regime.

<doc id="707057" wikidata="Q5034036" url="?curid=707057" title="Colleen Zenk">
<text>Colleen Zenk is an American actress. She is known for her role as Barbara Ryan in the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, a role she played from September 1978 until the show ended in September 2010. She received three Daytime Emmy Awards nominations for her performance.

==Early life==
Zenk was born in Barrington, Illinois, and studied drama at The Catholic University of America. Her goal was to be a dancer, but a knee injury ended her dancing career. She appeared in print ads and TV commercials at the beginning of her career, including several commercials for Kellogg&#x27;s.

==Career==
In 1975, Zenk moved to New York City and made her stage debut as well began screen tests for &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot;. After 12 failed soap opera screen tests, Zenk finally landed the role of Barbara Ryan in the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1978.

In 1980, she made her big screen debut appearing in the horror film, &quot;Christmas Evil&quot;. In 1982 she appeared with Albert Finney and Carol Burnett, in the musical film &quot;Annie&quot; directed by John Huston. In 1982, Zenk was also the focus of a commercial for L&#x27;eggs pantyhose.

In 1993, Zenk went to star along with fellow daytime performers Deidre Hall and Leslie Charleson in the leading roles of the NBC made-for-television movie &quot;Women on the Ledge&quot;.

=== &quot;As The World Turns&quot; ===
Zenk&#x27;s most notable role was as Barbara Ryan on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. After auditioning for several soap operas, including &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, Zenk was signed to a contract at &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and assumed the role of Barbara in 1978. She played the role for 32 years, until the show ended in 2010.

In the early years of Zenk&#x27;s run on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, her character, Barbara, was tormented by her criminal ex-husband, James Stenbeck (played by Anthony Herrera). For a brief period in the mid-1980s, the character of Barbara, as written by award-winning head writer Douglas Marland, became a complex romantic vixen.

In 2001, then head-writer Hogan Sheffer took the character in a drastically different direction after the character suffered burns in a fire which destroyed her face (and more deception by then-husband Craig Montgomery). Sheffer was quoted in a 2006 interview in a cover-feature article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that he wanted to give Zenk, who he felt was an &quot;under-utilized gem of an actress&quot;, more to do than just pour coffee with children underfoot. She was nominated for a Lead Actress Daytime Emmy Award in 2001, 2002. and 2011, and also voted Best Villain by Soap Opera Digest in 2003. Sheffer won the Emmy Outstanding Writing in 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005, in part with stories featuring Zenk&#x27;s work.

Zenk was prominently featured in the show&#x27;s special 50th anniversary episode &quot;Seven Divas on a Bus&quot; in April 2006, and also in several special comedy episodes over the years.

===Stage===
In 1980, Zenk co-starred on Broadway with musical theatre legends Chita Rivera and Donald O&#x27;Connor in the sequel to &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; titled &quot;Bring Back Birdie&quot;.

In the summer of 2005, Zenk came out of her self-imposed musical theater retirement and starred as Dolly Levi in a regional tour of &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; at the Academy Theater in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and the Pocono Playhouse. Due to overwhelming audience response, she was asked to reprise the role that fall at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

In June 2007, three weeks after her initial three surgeries for oral cancer, in the 50th anniversary production at Little Theatre on the Square of Sullivan, Illinois. The production was Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;, and Zenk played Phyllis Stone. Recovering from tongue reconstruction and on heavy pain medication due to radiation burning and side effects, Zenk sang and danced with the 35-piece orchestra, and brought down the house.

In April 2011, only four months after more cancer surgery to her tongue, she debuted her one-woman show &quot;Colleen Zenk: LIVE&quot; at Bob Egan&#x27;s New Hope, to great critical acclaim. She was featured in a new Off-Broadway show from the Araca Group, &quot;Odyssey – The Epic Musical&quot; at the American Theatre of Actors in October 2011. Then, the long-awaited New York debut of her one-woman show &quot;Still Sassy&quot; premiered at Feinstein&#x27;s at the Regency in New York City October–November 2011.

She was one of the many producers of the Broadway revival of &quot;Godspell&quot;. In late 2012, she starred in the off-Broadway world premiere of the stage version of the bestselling memoir, &quot;Marrying George Clooney, Confessions from a Mid-life Crisis&quot;. She kicked off the 2012–2013 theatre season for CAP21 in their &quot;Concerts for CAP21&quot; Benefit Series with a &quot;standing room only&quot; night of her one-woman show &quot;Still Sassy&quot;. In 2013, she portrayed iconic actress Tallulah Bankhead in the Regional Premiere of Matthew Lombardo&#x27;s play &quot;Looped&quot; at STAGEWORKS/Hudson.

The world premiere of Michael Slade&#x27;s play &quot;Family Shots&quot; at the Human Race Theatre Company in 2015 earned her a Lead Actress in a Play DayTony nomination. That same year, she played Polly Wyeth in back-to-back productions of the Pulitzer Prize nominated play &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot; by Jon Robin Baitz, directed by Dan Foster at Theatre Workshop of Nantucket and the Hudson Stage Company in New York.

In June 2018, Zenk returned to the role of &quot;Dolly in Hello, Dolly!&quot; at The Little Theatre on the Square.

In 2020, Zenk made several appearances on the YouTube show &quot;The Locher Room&quot;, which facilitates discussions with entertainment figures, including actors, writers and producers from soap operas.

=== Later screen appearances ===
In 2014, she appeared as Joan in the 5th-season episode &quot;Loose Lips&quot; of the CBS show &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

On &quot;Thurston&quot;, a Western web series, she portrayed town madam Agnes Snead, garnering two Lead Actress nominations from the Indie Series Awards. Zenk also appeared in supporting roles on the web series &quot;Tainted Dreams&quot; and &quot;Milgram and the Fastwalkers&quot;. In April 2018, the series &quot;After Forever&quot; debuted on Amazon; Zenk played Dr. Robbins.

In 2023, Zenk was cast in a recurring role as Jordan Howard on the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She departed the role in 2025.

==Personal life==
Zenk married musician and actor Michael Crouch in 1983.

In 1987, she married actor Mark Pinter, whom she met on the set of &quot;ATWT&quot;. Together, they raised 6 children (four from previous marriages and two from their union). They made their home in Fairfield County, Connecticut.

In May 2010, Zenk filed for divorce citing abandonment and irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in August 2010.

=== Health issues ===
In 2007, Zenk was diagnosed with oral cancer. Through a series of four surgeries including brachytherapy radiation, Zenk&#x27;s stage II cancer was treated. In October 2007, Zenk appeared on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot; to publicize the risk factors of oral cancer and to stress the importance of early screening.

She partnered with the Oral Cancer Foundation to do additional interviews in print and TV media as well as produce public service TV announcements (PSA) on the importance of early detection. In 2008, CBS donated approximately $500,000 in airtime minutes on their national affiliates for the PSA to play.

Her story was told in depth in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine in March 2009. In the article, Zenk said it appears her cancer was most likely caused by HPV-16, a strain of a common sexually transmitted virus that can potentially also cause cervical cancer.

Zenk revealed that she contracted COVID-19 in 2020, with a lengthy recovery period.

<doc id="707061" wikidata="Q545216" url="?curid=707061" title="John Glen (director)">
<text>John Glen (born 15 May 1932) is a retired English film director and editor. He is best known for his work on the &quot;James Bond&quot; series, firstly by editing a number of earlier James Bond films and then later moving on to direct a further five Bond films in the franchise.

==Life and career==
Glen had his start in the film-making industry as a messenger boy in 1945. By the late 1940s, he was working in the visual and sound editorial departments of Shepperton Studios for films produced by Alexander Korda, such as &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; (1950). Moving up the ranks, Glen made his picture editorial debut on a documentary series titled &quot;Chemistry for Six Forms&quot; in 1961, and his directorial debut on the TV series &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot; in 1968 (directing the episode &quot;Somebody Loses, Somebody ... Wins?&quot;).

During the 1960s and 1970s, Glen served as a film editor and second unit director, working on such films as &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978); he also contributed to three &quot;James Bond&quot; films: &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). Following the release of &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Glen was promoted to the rank of official director of the series; he went on to direct all five &quot;Bond&quot; films of the 1980s. He holds the record for directing the most number of films in the series to date, just one film more than Guy Hamilton. The films are:

*&quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981)
*&quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983)
*&quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985)
*&quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987)
*&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989)

After &quot;Bond&quot;, Glen continued to direct, with credits including &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Point Men&quot; (2001). He also directed episodes of the science-fiction television series &quot;Space Precinct&quot; (1994–95). In 2001, he published his memoir, &quot;For My Eyes Only&quot;.

==Directorial style==
Glen&#x27;s films contain a recurring motif in the form of a startled pigeon that makes the actor (as well as the audience) jump; it is especially noticeable in his five &quot;James Bond&quot; films. Variations exist; in some cases, the animal is a cat (&quot;A View to a Kill&quot;) or a monkey (&quot;The Living Daylights&quot;). As editor of &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Glen was responsible for creating the &quot;double-taking pigeon&quot;, an editing trick that makes it appear as if a bird in St Mark&#x27;s Square in Venice cannot believe its eyes when Bond&#x27;s (Roger Moore) gondola transforms into a hovercraft. In addition, all of Glen&#x27;s &quot;Bond&quot; films feature a character who dies by falling from a height, in a sequence commonly accompanied by the same &quot;male scream&quot; sound effect.

Glen often re-used actors in his films. In his autobiography, he states that he wanted to cast Timothy Dalton in &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; but that Dalton left the project before shooting commenced; Glen wonders whetherfollowing an argument at the end of shooting on &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;Dalton did not wish to appear in any more of his films. Several other cast members from the Glen &quot;Bond&quot; films appear in &quot;Christopher Columbus: the Discovery&quot;; among them are Robert Davi (who played Franz Sanchez in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;), Benicio del Toro (who played Dario in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;), and Michael Gothard (who played Emile Leopold Locque in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;).

By far his most frequent acting collaborator was Roger Moore, who worked with Glen on eleven films.

<text>Mount Keira ( ) is a suburb and mountain in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.

Mount Keira is a site of significant cultural heritage for the Wodi Wodi people. The name Mount Keira derives from the Wodi Wodi name for the mountain, &quot;Geera&quot; or &quot;Djera.&quot; The first maps of the area called it Keera, later adding the &#x27;i&#x27;. Mount Keira forms a part of the Illawarra escarpment, all of which is sacred land to the Wodi Wodi people of the wider Dharawal language group. 

The suburb of Mount Keira, a semi-rural township of Wollongong, is located on the mountain&#x27;s summit and southern flank.

The summit of Mount Keira has an elevation of above sea level that is located northwest of the city of Wollongong. Its distinctive shape and proximity to Wollongong make it a major local landmark. It is noted for the views of the city from the popular summit lookout and its history of coal mining. It was formed as part of the Illawarra escarpment fold between 80 and 60 million years ago and the erosion by creeks that ensued.

== Indigenous significance and history ==
Mount Keira is located on the traditional lands of the Wodi Wodi people, who form a part of the larger Dharawal language group. Archeological evidence shows Dharawal people have occupied the Illawarra for at least 30,000 years. Patterns of use have been recorded in oral histories, physical features and written records. 

=== The Story of Mount Keira and the Five Islands ===
According to the &quot;Alcheringa&quot;, the dreaming of the local Aboriginal peoples, Mount Keira is Geera, the daughter of Oola-boola-woo, the West Wind. The story of the creation of Mount Keira is tied to the creation of the Five Islands, which sit just off the Wollongong coast. In the story, Oola-boola-woo had six daughters, Mimosa, Wilga, Lilli Pilli, Wattle, Clematis and Geera. They lived a-top the Illawarra escarpment, and one by one the first five children misbehaved, raising the ire of Oola-boola-woo, who cast them and the stone beneath them out to sea, forming the Five Islands. Geera, who was now the only child left on their escarpment home, had no one to play with and no one to talk to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually, she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.

=== Education ===
Mount Keira has been recognised as one of the most significant educational resources and teaching sites to the Dharawal people of the Illawarra region. Today, this is reflected in some of the major educational institutions of the Illawarra including the University of Wollongong, Wollongong TAFE, Wollongong High School and Keira High School sitting in the shadow of Mt Keira. Mount Keira demonstration school is a small public school that lies at the base of the mountain.

=== Indigenous perspectives on future development ===
Mount Keira has been described as the Uluru of the Illawarra, due to its deep cultural significance. There are currently plans for Mount Keira to be further developed for adventure tourism. These plans for further development have caused some contention in the Indigenous community, who want to ensure the site is respected as a place of spiritual and historical importance. 

== Geographic description ==
Mount Keira forms part of the Illawarra escarpment which it joins by a high saddle on the back (western) side. It is capped by a westward-sloping plateau of relatively hard sandstone ringed on the remaining 3 sides by cliffs. From the cliff base the mountain slopes down to the surrounding foothills and coastal plain. From Wollongong, the mountain looks rather flat-topped; while from the north it appears part of the escarpment.

The majority of the mountain is forested with eucalypt (sclerophyll) forest and sub-tropical rainforest, while civilisation encroaches on the lower slope regions. Surrounding suburbs are (from north to south): Balgownie, Mount Pleasant; Mount Ousley; Keiraville; West Wollongong; Figtree and Mount Kembla.
The mountain is drained by several creeks, and has many gullies on its slopes such as the ones present on the ring track and the one directly south of the mountain known as Hell Hole after an axe murder by a convict who dispatched a labourer known as Old Tom in Byarong Creek. The south and western slopes are drained by Byarong Creek which flows west of Byarong Park before descending to Figtree and then to the sea. The eastern slopes are drained by creeks that flow into Para or Fairy Creek which flows through the Wollongong Botanic Gardens before arriving at Fairy Lagoon at Puckeys Estate Reserve. The northern slopes are drained by Cabbage Tree Creek.

Mount Ousley Road climbs up the northern spur and over the escarpment and is the major road link between Wollongong and Sydney. On the road is the small suburb of Mount Pleasant. At Mount Pleasant is the Illawarra Rhododendron Park, located on Parrish Avenue near the start of the Mount Pleasant Track. It contains thousands of azaleas and hundreds of rhododendrons as well as camellias. A section of rainforest is located in the top section with short walking trails. The park covers .

On the southern side, Mount Keira Road leaves suburbia and winds its way through the bush up the back of the mountain, giving access to the (now closed) Kemira coal mine, Byarong park, Girl Guides camp, Scout camp, and ultimately the summit lookout via Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Scout camp was established in 1939 by Sid Hoskins and later described by Lady Baden Powell (wife of Lord Baden Powell, the founder of Scouting) as &quot;surely one of the most beautiful campsites in the world&quot;. Mount Keira Road was built using convict labour in 1835–1836, surveyed by Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell, using much of the route used by O&#x27;Briens Road but descending the south and west slopes of Mount Keira rather than Mount Nebo, a nearby hill to Mount Keira&#x27;s south. Byarong Park was originally a pit pony grazing area, the ponies were stabled at the site of the Girl Guide camp.

=== Summit lookout ===

In 1955 the Rotary Club of Wollongong, with the active support of local government and businesses, constructed the summit lookout. In 2005, the Summit Park refurbishment provided an opening up of magnificent vistas of the coastal plain from Kiama to Sydney, and is managed as an annexe of the Wollongong Botanic Garden. It contains 9.4 hectares of land and it is a major tourist destination, many visitors to Wollongong climbing the Ken Ausburn Track.

As well as overlooking Wollongong, the summit provides views from the Kurnell Refinery north to the northern headland of Jervis Bay, south, as well as the Blue Mountains to the far west and out to sea to the east for . On a good day it is easy to see the northern escarpment and, from the Victoria Rock Lookout, reached by a short trail or cliff track, one can see Knights Hill, Mount Kembla and Saddleback Mountain clearly. Summit facilities include car parking spaces, toilets, picnic areas with wooden tables and benches and a kiosk/restaurant, the Mountaintop. An early man to climb the mountain of note was botanist Allan Cunningham.

At the summit is the Mountaintop Restaurant, used for food, drink and function purposes. Just west of it by a few metres is the transmission tower, visible easily from the plain and a local landmark. The new larger tower was built by Telstra with the ownership reverting to Wollongong City Council on completion. There was a campaign to paint it green so it would blend with the summit plateau canopy but this failed and it remains grey.

In 2006 binocular telescopes were fitted, and after several tests, vandalism and malfunctioning being a problem, they are currently in use for gold coin donation to the rotary club. With these it is possible to see up close places like Stanwell Park in the distance and Brokers Nose trigonometry station.

The summit lookout and Queen Elizabeth Drive was officially opened in 1959, but attempts to secure land from Australian Iron &amp; Steel began in 1954. Both a map and plaque remain from the original lookout park design, though the previous hang-gliding ramp has been taken down for the new observation walkways.

==Flora and fauna==
Eucalypt forest and rainforest cover the mountain summit and undeveloped slopes. Rainforest is predominant in sheltered areas, particularly on the southern side.

The mountain has been heavily logged in the past, yielding blackbutt, blue gum, turpentine and other timbers. Red cedar, in particular, was highly prized and there are stories of giant trees with trunk diameters of or more being felled. Remnant bushland on the west and north slopes and a few trees defying extensive logging still exist, but much of the east slopes are replaced bushland grown after clearing since the 1930s.

Plant species found on the mountain include:
* Cabbage tree palm (&quot;Livistona australis&quot;).
* Coast white box (&quot;Eucalyptus quadrangulata&quot;).
* Giant stinging tree (&quot;Dendrocnide excelsa&quot;)
* Native Tamarind (&quot;Diploglottis australis&quot;).
* Red cedar (&quot;Toona australis&quot;).
* Sassafras (&quot;Doryphora sassafras&quot;).
* Turpentine (&quot;Syncarpia glomulifera&quot;).
* Citronella (&quot;Citronella moorei&quot;).
* Jackwood (&quot;Cryptocarya glaucescens&quot;).
* Bollygum (&quot;Litsea reticulata&quot;).

Introduced weeds such as lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;) have also gained a hold on the mountain, particularly since the 1968 bushfires.

The forests provide habitat for a large number of bird and other fauna species.

Notable fauna species include:
* Echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;).
* Eastern Blue-tongued lizard (&quot;Tiliqua scincoides scincoides&quot;).
* Superb lyrebird (&quot;Menura novaehollandiae&quot;).
* Wallaby.

There is also a population of introduced Rusa deer residing on and around the mountain, which are often seen by local residents at dusk or dawn. 

==Walking tracks==
The Mount Keira Ring Track provides walkers with a moderate (3–5-hour) round trip. The Ring Track encircles the mountain at an average height of 250 metres. The walk can be commenced from a number of locations, including Mount Keira summit, Byarong Park, the Scout Camp and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The Ring Track can also be joined from the Mount Pleasant Track, which starts from Parrish Avenue. From Byarong Park, a picnic area with parking and an information bay, access to the Ring Track is via a short link track that runs from the northern perimeter of the picnic area to the entrance of the Girl Guide Camp road. The link track crosses the Guide Camp road and then ascends a short distance through rainforest, before joining the Ring Track. From the junction, two branches of the Ring Track ascend the mountain. The left branch gently climbs the southern flank of Mount Keira, following Mitchells Road to a saddle located at the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. The right branch traverses the mountain&#x27;s eastern flank, before emerging at Geordies Flat on Mount Keira Road. From Geordies Flat, the northern branch of the Ring Track climbs steadily to the junction of Mount Keira Road and Queen Elizabeth Drive. At this point, walkers can also join the Robertsons Lookout track, a short walk that terminates at a viewpoint that takes in the Scout Camp, Mount Keira and the Illawarra coast. At Geordies Flat, a vehicle width trail leads north to Parrish avenue. Walkers combine this trail with the Ring Track and the Mount Pleasant walking track to complete a loop walk.

Highlights of the Ring Track are rainforest and many species of unique Australian animals, including wallabies, lyrebirds, brush turkeys, echidnas. Lyrebirds are common on the southern slopes. Rain forests have a mostly open understorey, consisting of ferns and low shrubs. Weeds such as Lantana are evident where the natural environment has been disturbed. Eucalyptus forests thrive where the rain forests have been cleared but even here rainforest plants typically dominate the understorey.

Walkers can climb from the Ring Track&#x27;s southern branch to Mount Keira summit via the Dave Walsh Track, which joins the Ring Track opposite the Scout Camp Road, or from the northern branch via a branch track that emerges about halfway along Queen Elizabeth Drive. At the summit, the Dave Walsh track emerges at Five Islands Lookout. A short track leads to the summit park, where there is parking, toilets and a café. With care, walkers using the short northern link to Queen Elizabeth Drive can turn left when they reach the road and walk along the road to the summit. Walkers need to exercise great caution when walking along Queen Elizabeth Road because the road is narrow and steep with blind corners that limit visibility of both cars and walkers. From Mount Keira summit, fine views of Warra to the south and Brokers Nose Promontory to the north can be seen.

The track surface is variable. On the southern and eastern flanks, the track is reasonably well formed and the gradients are relatively steady. The northern branch is steeper and more rugged. The northern flank contains some particularly magnificent rain forests. The southern section of the track follows an early convict built road on Mount Keira, some of which is still visible. A similar feature, an early attempt to construct a carriageway, is visible west of the summit track on Mount Kembla. Also on the southern flank there is also an old telegraph camp site. The Ring Track is a locally well known and is popular with joggers, walkers and school groups. The track was rebuilt after it was damaged in 1998 by severe storms.


The Dave Walsh Track, named after a Scout leader, climbs from Mount Keira Road opposite the Scout Camp road through a small open area of ground ferns, up the western slope of Mount Keira, to Five Islands Lookout and the Summit Track. At the Mount Keira summit, it can also be reached via a maintenance trail that leads from the carpark in Summit Park. The tree growth is mainly Eucalyptus, ground plants including Lomandra Longifolia and Maidenhair fern. Wallabies, lizards, snakes and many forms of bird and insects live in the area. 
The Ken Ausburn Track begins at the end of Northfields Avenue (near the University of Wollongong and Wollongong Botanic Garden). It climbs up a steep grass path and turns into a section of wooden steps and a boardwalk. At the top of the steps is a plaque indicating several bird species to be found on the track. Near this is an oddly out of place lemon tree. It follows a level path to an open grass area where it then reaches the Lawrence Hargrave Memorial Sculpture, situated in an open grass area. The sculpture was made from 1988 to 1989 by Herbert &quot;Bert&quot; Flugelman, and is of stainless steel and part of the University of Wollongong Art Collection.

After this the track goes along gradually climbing a ridge until it reaches the Northern Illawarra Lookout, which gives views to the north and has a plaque telling of the shipwreck at Towradgi Point. From here it continues through a cutting, with a plaque indicating the cutting is a survivor from the Mount Keira Tramway opened in 1859. The track goes up some more wooden steps and reaches a brick airshaft completed in 1907 used to ventilate the Kemira Colliery, and a plaque tells of the mine&#x27;s history. From here the track goes for a short distance before reaching the Mount Pleasant Management Trail, and then to the northeastern entrance to the Ring Track, at Geordies Flat on Mount Keira Road. The track is popular with joggers and tourists, and has many plaques indicating various sights such as a remaining grey ironbark left from extensive logging in the late 19th century and several plants such as the invasive weed Lantana Camara and the native Settlers Flax.

The Mount Pleasant Track is long. It extends between Parrish Avenue at Mount Pleasant and Mount Keira Road. By car, Parrish Avenue is reached by turning left off Mount Ousley Road (immediately before the Mount Pleasant road overpass bridge, driving southbound), and then right onto the overpass bridge. The track climbs the middle slopes of Mount Keira via dense rainforest. From Parrish Avenue, the walk steeply ascends a wide trail for about before narrowing to less than . The final wind through the rainforest, which contains many ferns, vines and palms. Large boulders are evidence of previous rockfalls from the sandstone plateau, which forms the escarpment cliffs and Mount Keira summit. Over the last the gradient decreases until it reaches the Ring Track. About north of the track-head at Parrish avenue are the Illawarra Rhododendron Gardens. The Gardens are lush, quiet and pleasantly cool in most seasons. Walkers can complete a loop back to Parrish Avenue by turning left onto the Ring Track and left again onto the Mount Pleasant Management Trail at Geordies Flat.

The Mount Pleasant Management Trail is a trail used for walking and mountain bike riding, bicycles being permitted only on management trails and not on walking tracks in the Illawarra Escarpment State Conservation Area. The trail travels between the suburb of Mount Pleasant and Mount Keira Road, where it emerges at the hairpin bend (Geordies Flat). The trail is wide. From Mount Pleasant the trail ascends steadily to its junction with the Ken Ausburn Track, which is located on the walker&#x27;s left (east side of the trail). From here ascends a steep hill before levelling out to Mount Keira Road. Near the entrance to the Ken Ausburn track, views of Wollongong can be had. From Mount Pleasant good views of the northern cliff face can be seen. Birdwatching is an activity on this track, for many species can easily be seen including lyrebirds.

The Keira Summit Track skirts the edge of the Mount Keira cliff line. It links the Queen Victoria Lookout and Five Islands Lookout. The track forms a short loop when combined with a management trail that leads between the Five Islands lookout and the summit car park. The track goes through thick bush at the eastern clifftop and includes Sleber&#x27;s Mint Bush, Lomandra grasses and many native flowering plants.

==Mining history==
Coal was recorded at Mount Keira in 1839 by the Rev W. B. Clarke, a qualified geologist.

In 1848 James Shoobert, a retired sea captain, drove a tunnel into what is now known as the No. 3 (Wongawilli) seam. He then observed an outcrop of the No. 2 (Balgownie or 4-ft) seam, in which the coal was of better quality, and drove tunnels into it in 1849 and 1850. This was known as the Albert Coal Mine and was the first in the Illawarra. Shoobert lacked the capital to develop the mine and in 1856 sold it by auction to Henry Osborne. In April 1857 a new tunnel was opened into the higher No 1 (Bulli) seam a short distance away by William Robson for Osborne and called the Osborne Wallsend Colliery. On 16 April 1857 the first of coal from the new mine was delivered to the wharf at Wollongong&#x27;s Belmore Basin by bullock team for trial in the &quot;S.S. Illawarra&quot;. Keira coal gained a reputation for being superior to any other coal, and by the 1870s large shipments were being made to Sydney, India and parts of Asia

Coal was originally forked into approximately capacity wooden skips, hauled to the surface by horse and then carted down the mountain by a track joining Mount Keira Road near Hurt Street. Later improvements include a Main and Tail Rope Haulage installation to bring coal to the surface, and a self acting skip incline (that is, empty skips hauled up to the mine by the descending loaded skips) to transport the coal to the foot of the mountain at what is now Gooyong Street Keiraville

In May 1861 a narrow-gauge tramway was constructed from the incline to Belmore Basin (Wollongong Harbour) after the Mount Keira Tramways Act was passed by parliament. In 1878 the tramroad was widened to standard gauge and horse teams used for hauling the coal were replaced by steam locomotives. These locomotives, the Keira No. 1 and Keira No. 2 were the first locomotives to work on this coal route but steam locomotives were earlier used at Bulli Colliery from 1867 – even though the first Bulli locomotive purchased proved too heavy for the track which had previously been designed for an ingenious gravitational coal-skip incline to the jetty over four cuttings and four bridges. The locomotives at Keira ceased running in 1954 when the line was closed.

On a modern street map the route of the tramway followed Gooyong Street, Rose Street, Throsby Drive (Tramway Bridge) and then between Campbell Street and Smith Street (including the Illawarra Master Builders Club carpark) to Osborne Park and Belmore Basin. The route can still be traced on a modern aerial or satellite photograph. In 1937 Australian Iron &amp; Steel (later a subsidiary of BHP) acquired the colliery for its Port Kembla steelworks. In 1942 a diesel locomotive was introduced at the mine, the first underground diesel locomotive in Australia.

In 1954 the skipway and tramway was replaced by a tunnel driven from the escarpment at the head of the company&#x27;s private railway between Mount Nebo and Mount Kembla. In 1955 the mine was renamed Kemira (from &quot;Kem&quot;bla and Ke&quot;ira&quot;). Longwall mining was introduced in the 1960s. Peak production was reached in the year ending November 1979 with . In 1982 a downturn in the steel industry resulted in 189 employees (60% of the workforce) being retrenched, resulting in a 16-day &quot;sit-in&quot; protest by 30, and mining finally ceased on 27 September 1991.

<text>Ikat (literally &quot;to bind&quot; in Malayo-Polynesian languages) is a dyeing technique from Southeast Asia used to pattern textiles that employs resist dyeing on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric. In Southeast Asia, where it is the most widespread, &quot;ikat&quot; weaving traditions can be divided into two general groups of related traditions. The first is found among Daic-speaking peoples (Laos, northern Vietnam, and Hainan). The second, larger group is found among the Austronesian peoples (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Timor-Leste) and spread via the Austronesian expansion to as far as Madagascar. It is most prominently associated with the textile traditions of Indonesia in modern times, from where the term &quot;ikat&quot; originates. Similar unrelated dyeing and weaving techniques that developed independently are also present in other regions of the world, including India, Central Asia, Japan (where it is called &quot;kasuri&quot;), Africa, and the Americas. 

In &quot;ikat&quot;, the resist is formed by binding individual yarns or bundles of yarns with a tight wrapping applied in the desired pattern. The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as tie-dye and &quot;batik&quot; the resist is applied to the woven cloth, whereas in &quot;ikat&quot; the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth, in &quot;ikat&quot; both fabric faces are patterned. &quot;Ikat&quot; can be classified into three general types: warp &quot;ikat&quot; and weft &quot;ikat&quot;, in which the warp and weft yarns are dyed, respectively; and double &quot;ikat&quot;, where both the warp and weft yarns are dyed.

A characteristic of &quot;ikat&quot; textiles is an apparent &quot;blurriness&quot; to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth. The blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson. &quot;Ikat&quot; with little blurriness, multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive. However, the blurriness that is so characteristic of &quot;ikat&quot; is often prized by textile collectors.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ikat&quot; is an Indonesian word, which depending on context, can be the nouns: cord, thread, knot, or bundle, also the finished &quot;ikat&quot; fabric, as well as the verbs &quot;to tie&quot; or &quot;to bind&quot;; the term &quot;ikatan&quot; is a noun for bond or tie. It has a direct etymological relation to cognates in various Indonesian languages from 
Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, Sumba, Flores and Timor. Thus, the name of the finished &quot;ikat&quot; woven fabric originates from the &quot;tali&quot; (threads, ropes) being &quot;ikat&quot; (tied, bound, knotted) before they are being put in &quot;celupan&quot; (dyed by way of dipping), then &quot;berjalin&quot; (woven, intertwined) resulting in a &quot;berjalin ikat&quot;- reduced to &quot;ikat&quot;.

The introduction of the term &quot;ikat&quot; into European language is attributed to Rouffaer. &quot;Ikat&quot; is now a generic English loanword used to describe the process and the cloth itself regardless of where the fabric was produced or how it is patterned.

In Indonesian, the plural of &quot;ikat&quot; remains &quot;ikat&quot;. While in English, a suffix plural &#x27;s&#x27; is commonly added, as in &quot;ikats&quot;. However, these terms are interchangeable and both are correct.

==History==
Warp &quot;ikat&quot; traditions in Southeast Asia are believed to have originated in Neolithic weaving traditions (older than at least 6000 BP) somewhere in mainland Asia, and is associated with the Austronesian and Daic-speaking peoples. This is based on a 2012 comparative study on loom technologies, textile patterns, and linguistics. It was spread outwards along with the Austronesian expansion to maritime Southeast Asia, reaching as far as Madagascar by the 1st millennium BC.

Previously, &quot;ikat&quot; traditions were suggested by some authors to be originally acquired by Austronesians from contact with the Dong Son culture of Vietnam, but this was deemed unlikely in a 2012 study.

Elsewhere, particularly in India and Central Asia, very similar traditions have also developed that are also known as &quot;ikat&quot;. These likely developed independently. Uyghurs call it &quot;atlas&quot; (IPA [ɛtlɛs]) and use it only for woman&#x27;s clothing. The historical record indicates that there were 27 types of atlas during Qing Chinese occupation. Now there are only four types of Uyghur atlas remaining: &quot;qara-atlas&quot;, a black &quot;ikat&quot; used for older women&#x27;s clothing; &quot;khoja&#x27;e-atlas&quot;, a yellow, blue, or purple &quot;ikat&quot; used for married women; &quot;qizil-atlas&quot;, a red &quot;ikat&quot; used for girls; and &quot;Yarkent-atlas&quot;, a khan or royal atlas. Yarkent-atlas has more diverse styles; during the Yarkent Khanate (1514–1705), there were ten different styles of Yarkent-atlas.

==Types==

In warp &quot;ikat&quot; it is only the warp yarns that are dyed using the &quot;ikat&quot; technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The &quot;ikat&quot; pattern is clearly visible in the warp yarns wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp &quot;ikat&quot; is, amongst others, produced in Indonesia; more specifically in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra by respectively the Dayaks, Torajans and Bataks.

In weft &quot;ikat&quot; it is the weaving of weft yarn that carries the dyed patterns. Therefore, the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds. Weft &quot;ikat&quot;s are much slower to weave than warp &quot;ikat&quot; because the weft yarns must be carefully adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain the clarity of the design.

Double &quot;ikat&quot; is a technique in which both warp and the weft are resist-dyed prior to weaving. Obviously it is the most difficult to make and the most expensive. Double &quot;ikat&quot; is only produced in three countries: India, Japan and Indonesia. The double &quot;ikat&quot; made in Patan, Gujarat in India is the most complicated. Called &quot;patola&quot;, it is made using fine silk yarns and many colours. It may be patterned with a small motif that is repeated many times across the length of a six-meter sari. Sometimes the Patan double &quot;ikat&quot; is pictorial with no repeats across its length. That is, each small design element in each colour was individually tied in the warp and weft yarns. It&#x27;s an extraordinary achievement in the textile arts. These much sought after textiles were traded by the Dutch East Indies company for exclusive spice trading rights with the sultanates of Indonesia. The double &quot;ikat&quot; woven in the small Bali Aga village, Tenganan in east Bali in Indonesia reflects the influence of these prized textiles. Some of the Tenganan double &quot;ikat&quot; motifs are taken directly from the &quot;patola&quot; tradition. In India, double &quot;ikat&quot; is also woven in Puttapaka, Nalgonda district, and is called &quot;Puttapaka Saree.&quot; In Japan, double &quot;ikat&quot; is woven in the Okinawa islands where it is called &quot;tate-yoko gasuri&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;Ikat&quot; is a resist dyeing technique common to many world cultures. It is probably one of the oldest forms of textile decoration. However, it is most prevalent in Indonesia, India and Japan. In South America, Central and North America, &quot;ikat&quot; is still common in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico, respectively.

In the 19th century, the Silk Road desert oases of Bukhara, Samarkand, Hotan and Kashgar (in what is now Uzbekistan and Xinjiang in Central Asia) were famous for their fine silk Uzbek/Uyghur &quot;ikat&quot;.

India, Japan, Indonesia and many other Southeast Asian nations including Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines and Thailand have weaving cultures with long histories of &quot;ikat&quot; resist dyeing.

Double &quot;ikat&quot; textiles are still found in India, Japan and Indonesia. In Indonesia, &quot;ikat&quot; textiles are produced throughout the islands from Sumatra in the west to Timor in the east and Kalimantan and Sulawesi in the north. &quot;Ikat&quot; is also found in Iran, where the Persian name is &quot;daraee&quot;. &quot;Daraee&quot; means wealth, and this fabric is often included in a bride&#x27;s dowry during wedding ceremonies; the people who bought these fabrics were rich.

==Production==
===Warp &quot;ikat&quot;===


&quot;Ikat&quot; created by dyeing the warps (warp &quot;ikat&quot;) is simpler to make than either weft &quot;ikat&quot; or double &quot;ikat&quot;. First the yarns--cotton, silk, wool or other fibres—are wound onto a tying frame. Then they are separated into bundles. As the binding process is very labor-intensive an effort is made to reduce the work to a minimum by folding the thread bundles like in paper dolls and binding a basic &quot;ikat&quot; motif (BIM) that will be repeated like in paper dolls when the threads are unfolded for weaving after the dyeing is completed. The thread bundles may be folded around a vertical and/or horizontal axis. The bundles may be covered with wax, as in batik. (However, in making batik, the crafts person applies the resist to the finished cloth rather than to the yarns to be woven.) The warp yarns are then wrapped tightly with thread or some other dye-resistant material with the desired pattern so as to prevent unwanted dye penetration. The procedure is repeated, according to the number of colours required to complete the design. Multiple coloration is common, requiring multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. After the dyeing is finished the bindings are removed and the threads are wound onto the loom as the warp (longitudinal yarns). The threads are adjusted to precisely align the motifs and thin bamboo strips are lashed to the threads to prevent them from tangling or slipping out of alignment during weaving.

Some &quot;ikat&quot; traditions, such as Central Asia&#x27;s, embrace a blurred aesthetic in the design. Other traditions favour a more precise and more difficult to achieve alignment of the &quot;ikat&quot; yarns. South American and Indonesian &quot;ikat&quot; are known for a high degree of warp alignment. Weavers carefully adjust the warp threads when they are placed on the loom so the patterns appear clearly. Thin strips of bamboo are then lashed to the warps to maintain the pattern alignment during weaving.

Patterns are visible in the warp threads even before the weft, a plain colored thread, is woven in. Some warp &quot;ikat&quot; traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a &quot;mirror-image&quot; running along their long centre line. That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central warp thread group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

===Weft &quot;ikat&quot;===
Weft &quot;ikat&quot; (&quot;endek&quot; in Bali) uses resist-dyeing for the weft yarns. The movement of the weft yarns in the weaving process means precisely delineated patterns are more difficult to achieve. The weft yarn must be adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to preserve the clarity of the patterns.

Nevertheless, highly skilled artisans can produce precise weft &quot;ikat&quot;. Japanese weavers produce very accurate indigo and white weft &quot;ikat&quot; with small scale motifs in cotton. Weavers in Odisha, India have replicated fine patterns in weft &quot;ikat&quot;. In Thailand, weavers make silk sarongs depicting birds and complex geometrical designs in seven-colour weft &quot;ikat&quot;.

In some precise weft &quot;ikat&quot; traditions (Gujarat, India), two artisans weave the cloth: one passes the shuttle and the other adjusts the way the yarn lies in the shed.

As the weft is a continuous strand, aberrations or variations in the weaving tension are cumulative. Some weft &quot;ikat&quot; traditions incorporate this affect into their aesthetic. Patterns become transformed by the weaving process into irregular and erratic designs. Guatemalan &quot;ikat&quot; is well-noted for its beautiful &quot;blurs.&quot;

==Double &quot;ikat&quot;==
 

Double &quot;ikat&quot; is created by resist-dyeing both the warp and weft prior to weaving. Some sources use the term double &quot;ikat&quot; only when the warp and weft patterning overlap to form common, identical motifs. If they do not, the result is referred to as compound &quot;ikat&quot;.

This form of weaving requires the most skill for precise patterns to be woven and is considered the premiere form of &quot;ikat&quot;. The amount of labour and skill required also make it the most expensive, and many poor quality cloths flood the tourist markets. Indian and Indonesian examples typify highly precise double &quot;ikat&quot;. Especially prized are the double &quot;ikat&quot;s woven in silk known in India as &quot;patola&quot; (singular: &quot;patolu&quot;). These are from Khambat, Gujarat. During the colonial era, Dutch merchants used &quot;patola&quot; as prestigious trade cloths during the peak of the spice trade.

In Indonesia, double &quot;ikat&quot; is only woven in the Bali Aga village of Tenganan. These cloths have high spiritual significance. In Tenganan they are still worn for specific ceremonies. Outside Tenganan, &quot;geringsing&quot; are treasured as they are purported to have magical powers.

The double &quot;ikat&quot; of Japan is woven in the Okinawa islands and is called &quot;tate-yoko gasuri&quot;.


Pochampally Saree, a variety from the small village of Andhra Pradesh in Nalgonda district, India, are silk saris woven in the double &quot;ikat&quot;.

The Puttapaka Saree is made in Puttapaka village, Samsthan Narayanpuram mandal in Nalgonda district, India. It is known for its unique style of silk saris. The symmetric design is over 200 years old. The &quot;ikat&quot; is warp-based. The Puttapaka Saree is a double &quot;ikat&quot;.

Before the weaving is done, a manual winding of yarn, called &quot;asu&quot;, needs to be performed. This process takes up to five hours per sari and is usually done by the womenfolk, who suffer physical strain through constantly moving their hands back and forth over 9000 times for each sari. In 1999 a young weaver, C. Mallesham, developed a machine which automated &quot;asu&quot;, thus developing a technological solution for a decades-old problem.

===Ōshima===
Ōshima &quot;ikat&quot; is a uniquely Japanese &quot;ikat&quot;. In Amami Ōshima, the warp and weft threads are both used as warp to weave stiff fabric, upon which the thread for the &quot;ikat&quot; weaving is spot-dyed. Then the mats are unravelled and the dyed thread is woven into Ōshima cloth.

The Ōshima process is duplicated in Java and Bali, and was reserved for ruling royalty, notably &quot;Klungkung&quot; and &quot;Ubud&quot;: most especially the &quot;dodot&quot; cloth semi-cummerbund of Javanese court attire.

==Other countries==
===Cambodia===
The Cambodian &quot;ikat&quot; is a weft &quot;ikat&quot; woven of silk on a multi-shaft loom with an uneven twill weave, which results in the weft threads showing more prominently on the front of the fabric than the back.

By the 19th century, Cambodian &quot;ikat&quot; was considered among the finest textiles of the world. When the King of Thailand came to the USA in 1856, he brought fine Cambodian &quot;ikat&quot; cloth as a gift for President Franklin Pierce. The most intricately patterned of the Cambodian fabrics are the &quot;sampot hol&quot; — skirts worn by the women — and the &quot;pidans&quot; — wall hangings used to decorate the pagoda or the home for special ceremonies.

Unfortunately, Cambodian culture suffered massive disruption and destruction during the mid-20th century Indochina wars but most especially during the Khmer Rouge regime. Most weavers were killed and the whole art of Cambodian &quot;ikat&quot; was in danger of disappearing. Kikuo Morimoto is a prominent pioneer in re-introducing &quot;ikat&quot; to Cambodia. In 1995, he moved from Japan and located one or two elderly weavers and Khmer Rouge survivors who knew the art and have taught it to a new generation.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, the local weft &quot;ikat&quot; type of woven cloth is known as matmi (also spelled &#x27;mudmee&#x27; or &#x27;mudmi&#x27;). Traditional Mudmi cloth was woven for daily use among the nobility. Other uses included ceremonial costumes. Warp &quot;ikat&quot; in cotton is also produced by the Karen and Lawa tribal peoples in northern Thailand.

This type of cloth is the favourite silk item woven by Khmer people living in southern Isan, mainly in Surin, Sisaket and Buriram provinces.

===Iran===

In Iran, &quot;ikat&quot;, known by the name &quot;darayee&quot;, has been woven in different areas. In Yazd, there are some workshops that produce it. It is said that this kind of cloth historically used to be included in a bride&#x27;s dowry. In popular culture, a quote states that people who bought this type of cloth were wealthy.

===Latin America===

&quot;Ikat&quot; patterns are common among the Andes peoples, and native people of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. The Mapuche shawl or poncho of the Huaso cowboys of Chile is perhaps the item best known in the West. Wool and &quot;cabuya&quot; fibre are the most commonly used.

The Mexican rebozos can be made from silk, wool or cotton and are frequently &quot;ikat&quot; dyed. These shawls are seen as a part of the Mexican national identity and most women own at least one.

Latin American &quot;ikat&quot; (Jaspe, as it is known to Maya weavers) textiles are commonly woven on a back-strap loom. Pre-dyed warp threads are a common item in traditional markets- saving the weaver much mess, expense, time and labour. A Latin American innovation which may also be employed elsewhere is to employ a round stick around which warp threads are wrapped in groups, thus allowing more precise control of the desired design. The &quot;corte&quot; is the typical wrap-skirt used worn by Guatemalan women.

===India===
In India, &quot;Ikat&quot; art has been present for thousands of years. In some parts of India, &quot;ikat&quot; processed cloth such as saree and kurtis are very popular, along with bedsheets, door screens, and towels.

===Uzbekistan===
&quot;Ikat&quot; is a common weaving technique in Uzbek culture. The Uzbek &quot;ikat&quot;, locally referred to as &quot;abrbandi&quot;, is distinguished by its bold and flamboyant patterns. The history of the Uzbek &quot;ikat&quot; dates back to the 19th century, when it was mastered by the Uzbeks. Since then, it has become an integral part of their cultural identity and an important aspect of traditional clothing.

==Accreditation==
As of 2010, the government of the Republic of Indonesia announced it would pursue UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage accreditation for its &quot;ikat&quot; weaving, along with &quot;songket&quot; and gamelan, having successfully attained this UNESCO recognition for its wayang, batik and the kris.

<text>Mount Kembla is a suburb and a mountain in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.

The suburb, a semi-rural township of Wollongong, gets its name from the mountain, located on the Illawarra escarpment, is derived from an Aboriginal word, &quot;kembla&quot;, meaning &quot;plenty of game&quot;. The satellite localities of Kembla Heights, Windy Gully, Cordeaux Valley and Kembla Village are comprised within the suburb of Mount Kembla and at the time of the , had a population of 1,083.

The summit of Mount Kembla has an elevation of above sea level.

The area surrounding Mount Kembla is a coal mining area, notable for the Mount Kembla Mine disaster of 1902 in which 96 people lost their lives.

==Mount Kembla suburb==
The suburb of Mount Kembla and its associated &quot;main&quot; village includes a local primary school, church and graveyard, several hundred houses and the Mount Kembla Hotel, which was built in 1896. The general store/post office closed in 2010, making it the first time in 145 years the village has been without one. The village also has a heritage centre showcasing local history, emphasizing the mining disaster. An annual Heritage Festival and 96 Candles Ceremony, commemorating the victims of the mine disaster, have been performed consistently every year since the disaster. The village is accessible from Wollongong, via Cordeaux Road, named after early settlers; and from Mount Keira via Harry Graham Drive. The small village of Kembla Heights is to the northwest, reached by Harry Graham Drive.

The Mount Kembla Colliery was established in 1883, and the purpose-built township was constructed by the company to house the employees. The community thrived until late-1970 when the mine closed and the town went into decline, losing its general store, post office, Presbyterian church, tennis courts and public telephones during the following years.

South32 is currently mining at the Dendrobium site, half a kilometre west of the village. Mount Kembla is joined to the west by the Illawarra escarpment and, in particular, a mass with two lower summits, Kembla West (512 m) and Mount Burelli (531 m). The mountain forms a prominent peak pointing approximately eastward.

==Mine disaster==
On 31 July 1902 the Mount Kembla Colliery exploded, killing 96 men and boys. The Mount Kembla Mine disaster was the second worst post-settlement peace-time disaster of Australia&#x27;s history (behind Cyclone Mahina), until the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria.

===The mine===
The Mount Kembla mine worked the Bulli seam which outcrops at above sea level on the side of Mount Kembla. The coal was worked through a drift mine with additional adits for ventilation and drainage. There are two main haulage roadways. The &quot;Main Tunnel&quot; roadway extends from the entrance in a north-westerly direction. The other main haulage way is called &quot;No. 1 Right&quot; and branches off the main tunnel in from the mouth. No. 1 Right runs due north. Branching off No. 1 Right are other passageways named &quot;First Right&quot;, &quot;Second Left&quot; and so forth. The &quot;Eastern District&quot; is at the end of No 1 Right and this is where the explosion occurred.

The mine was originally ventilated by return roads to the entrance and a furnace there. By the time of the explosion a new upcast shaft had been sunk over from the surface to the &quot;Shaft district&quot;. A furnace at the foot of the shaft drove the ventilation. The original return roads had then been converted to intakes and were used as travelling roads.

A quote from the mine manager, William Rogers, stated that the mine was &quot;absolutely without danger from gases&quot;, the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; reported that &quot;gas had never been known to exist in the mine before&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; recorded &quot;one of the best ventilated mines in the State&quot;.

The Royal Commission noted that the seam was the same one as at the Bulli Colliery some to the north-east. Bulli had been the site of a fire-damp and coal-dust explosion which had killed 81 people in 1887. Over four pages the commission summarised around 20 incidents of fire-damp which were reported to them. As a result of the evidence produced the commission tested parts of the mine themselves and found gas being given off &quot;in several widely distant parts of the mine&quot;. They accepted that under normal circumstances the ventilation would deal with the problem but &quot;This result ... leads the Commission irresistibly to the conclusion ... that, given favourable conditions for accumulation, a dangerous collection might be found in almost any part of the workings&quot;.

At the time of the disaster around of the mine&#x27;s had been worked out. All the coal had been removed and the resulting space was termed a &quot;goaf&quot;. When the props were withdrawn the roof was allowed to fall into the goaf.

===The disaster===
At around 14:00 on 31 July 1902 a large amount of flame and smoke burst from the main tunnel, along with a loud noise. Other adits had smoke driven out from them. 261 men were underground at the time, but after the blast some of them managed to find their own way out.

The Royal Commission produced a summary of their findings about the cause and mechanism of the disaster. A roof fall in the 4th Right goaf drove out a considerable amount of a fire-damp/air mixture. The mixture passed along the 4th Right road crossing the No. 1 Right traveling road and bursting through the canvas doors into No 1 Right haulage road. As the mixture travelled it raised coal dust which was carried with it. The mixture started to travel outbye before being stopped by the ventilation air current and forced back inbye. Some of the gas travelled ahead of the main pocket further inbye where it met the naked light used by a wheeler at the 4th Left junction. Once strong enough to ignite it flashed back along the haulage road to the main body of the gas. The fire-damp/coal-dust/air mixture then exploded. The force of the explosion raised more coal-dust leading to further explosions until the flame was seen to come out of the entrance.

The explosions &quot;wrecked a large portion of the mine&quot; and killed some miners. The incomplete combustion of the coal-dust resulted in the production of carbon monoxide, or after-damp. The after-damp was responsible for the majority of the deaths.

During the explosion the shaft district, where the ventilation furnace was, was not affected. The furnace continued to draw air through the mine and clear the after-damp. Since all drifts and adits were intakes the rescuers were able to enter the mine as the after-damp cleared. They were further hindered by roof falls caused by the explosion. Two of the rescuers, Mr H. O. MacCabe and William McMurray, pushed ahead too fast and were killed by the after-damp.

===Inquiries===
The day following the explosion the coroner at Wollongong opened an inquiry into the cause of death of the first of the miners brought out. Over the period from 1 August to 12 September 1902 the inquest sat on 22 days hearing evidence from 28 witnesses and visiting the mine. The Jury returned a verdict that the Meurant brothers and William Nelson &quot;came to their death … from carbon monoxide poisoning produced by an explosion of fire-damp ignited by the naked lights in use in the mine, and accelerated by a series of coal-dust explosions starting at a point in or about the number one main level back headings, and extending in a westerly direction to the small goaf, marked 11 perches [] on the mine plan.&quot;

A royal commission concerning the disaster was appointed on 6 November 1902 and held hearings in March, April and May 1903. The commission came to a different verdict from the coroner&#x27;s jury. In the first place they queried the meaning of &quot;accelerated by a series of coal-dust explosions&quot; pointing out that the coal-dust explosions were part of the initial blast and not a factor coming into play some time later. The commission then disagreed over the seat of the explosion, placing it at the junction of the 4th Right road and the No. 1 Haulage road, whereas the Coroner&#x27;s jury had placed it at number one main level back headings.

Once the commission had decided that the likely cause of the explosion was the expulsion of fire-damp from the 4th Right goaf they considered whether blame could or should be attached to any person or persons. Rule 10 of the mine required the inspection weekly of the state of waste workings. This was not being done. The inspections that were done looked at the state of the roof which was being allowed to fall. No testing for gas seems to have occurred, in part because the roof was highly unstable. The commission concluded that no normal testing would have revealed the gas accumulation in the roof of the goaf.

Rather than holding any individual official of the Mount Kembla Company responsible, the Commission stated that only the substitution of safety lamps for flame lights could have saved the lives of the 96 victims. However, flame lights continued to be used well into the 1940s.

===Aftermath===
Some of the dead were buried in Mount Kembla&#x27;s village cemetery, which also contains a -tall memorial to the disaster, listing the names of the miners and two rescuers who perished. The majority were buried in the more remote Windy Gully cemetery, south-west of the village, at which an annual memorial ceremony is observed during the Mt Kembla Mining Heritage Festival on the weekend after 31 July.

==History==
Local Aboriginal legends told of Mount Kembla and Mount Keira being sisters and the Five Islands being daughters of the wind. The first European to observe the mountain was Captain James Cook on his voyage from Whitby. While navigating the east coast of Australia, he noted it as &#x27;a round hill&#x27;, its top resembling a hat. The village was first settled in 1817 by George Molle.

Two old pit-pony watering holes on the ring track are still visible, as are the remains of an intended carriageway to the top (suspended in the 19th century and never completed) to the north of the Summit Track. On the eastern part of the Ring Track there are two mine entrances. Lantana weed has become a problem in the bushland of Mount Kembla, as have feral goats and deer.

During European times Mount Kembla has had a very significant role in mining industry. Mount Kembla is noted as being the home of the first kerosene mine in Australia. This mine was located near American Creek on land owned by John Graham, who remained one of the proprietors once mining operations commenced in mid July 1865. Coal mining has been the main industry in the area and continues presently with Dendrobium Mine still operating.

In addition to mining, Mount Kembla has a significant agricultural history; in particular the Cordeaux Valley area which was one of Australia&#x27;s top fruit growing industries, exporting as far away as London in its hey day as one of the country&#x27;s best apples producers.

==Notable people==
Mount Kembla is known for producing or attracting creative people; painters, poets, writers, photographers and history buffs are inspired by the area. Notable people include:
* Wendy Richardson , a playwright
* John McNamara , a poet and historian
* Fred Moore, a miner and activist.

==Geography==


Mount Kembla is joined to the sandstone cliffs of the Illawarra escarpment, overlooking Wollongong. The summit is above sea level and is a prominent local landmark, where it has a lookout linked to a ring track. The mountain has a unique collection of flora, being the fusing point for northern and southern types of eucalypt growth and containing many types of rainforest. It also has two orchards on the western slope. American Creek flows down the mountain, past the mine and village. The mountain is a high outcrop of mainly sandstone in a roughly east–west ridge extending from the escarpment to about to its east. It has a summit plateau divided into two sections, the higher one raised slightly above the west one, forming a small rise at the top. The ridge descends from the plateau and the mountain is generally quite thin at the top, widening below to create foothills that extend into the outer western suburbs of Wollongong and Unanderra. Many high trees are to be found there and pockets of rainforest grow about Dapto Creek and American Creek. American Creek flows to the north of the mountain from the joint to the escarpment and Dapto Creek from the southern side. A prominent foothill is at its southeast side, which juts out above farmland.

Mount Kembla forms part of the Illawarra Escarpment State Conservation Area, which stretches from Stanwell Park in the north to Wongawilli in the south. The conservation area is managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service.

==Flora and fauna==
Flora on the mountain includes blackwood, native peach, bastard rosewood, native cucumber, sandpaper fig, Moreton Bay fig, native ginger, native raspberries and hibiscus. Locally rare species include white beech and Bangalow palm.

Fauna on the mountain includes swamp wallabies, deer, spotted-tailed quolls, southern brown bandicoots, grey-headed flying foxes, sugar gliders, wombats, possums, giant burrowing frogs, red-crowned toadlets, striped marsh frogs, eastern water dragons, water skinks, blue-tongued lizards, diamond pythons, red-bellied black snakes, golden-crowned snakes and broad-headed snakes, although it is not common to see snakes, as some sources state incorrectly. Common birds are lyrebirds, spotted turtle doves, kookaburras, satin bower birds, superb blue wrens, crimson rosellas, king parrots, white-headed pigeons, brown cuckoo-doves, silvereyes, eastern yellow robins, rainbow lorikeets, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, golden whistlers, topknot (&quot;flocker&quot;) pigeons, wonga pigeons, Australian magpies, pied currawongs, Australian ravens, noisy miners, honeyeaters (Lewin&#x27;s, New Holland, spinebill, yellow-faced) eastern whipbirds, white-browed scrub wrens, rufous fantails, red-browed finches, and welcome swallows. In 1804 a logrunner bird was collected on Mount Kembla, this being the first to be scientifically described, although it is not common to see logrunners, or brush turkeys as some sources incorrectly state.

The European and scientific discovery of the koala in Australia was made at Mount Kembla and took place between June–August 1803 and involved type specimens collected and brought into Sydney in August 1803 where they were immediately figured by botanical draughtsman Ferdinand Bauer (1760–1826) and described by noted botanist Robert Brown (1773–1858). Koalas disappeared from the area probably during a subsequent gradual period of time due to the effect of clearing of forest in the habitat by settlers—however they were noticeably absent after a great fire of 1909 swept the Cordeax Valley and Mount Kembla area. The last report of suspected koala activity was in 1919 in the Cordeaux area.

==Walking tracks==
The Mount Kembla Ring Track follows a course around the mountain starting from the Kembla Lookout carpark on Cordeaux Road. It goes down some stone steps into a gully that flows down into Dapto Creek and then goes along the southern side of the mountain through palm and fern growth before turning at a junction. At this junction there is one of two pit pony watering holes on the east side of the mountain. The right turnoff goes into private property on Farmborough Road, but the left goes north to the second watering hole and a mine entrance. Another deviation on this side goes to another mine entrance, both are closed due to tunnel collapse risk. From here it goes through more open canopied Sclerophyll growth before coming out at Cordeaux Road near private property, though the track is legal for walking as long as within this marked section one does not deviate from the track itself. To complete the walk one must go up the road back to the lookout. This is generally done as described in an anti-clockwise fashion. Deer and wallabies are a not uncommon sight, with occasional snakes and feral goats seen.

The Mount Kembla Summit Track goes along the same small stretch of dry bush that begins the Ring Track but then branches to the left after a map/information stand. It climbs gradually up the summit ridge and on to the two summit plateaus, one by one, before going along the second to the trigonometry station.

The plateaus are both thin and go in an east–west direction along the ridge. The track is signposted near the beginning warning of &#x27;crumbling edges&#x27; but is also known for being saved from weathering and allowing easy access to the top. Beside this track to the left (north) is an old carriageway built but not completed, after finding large sandstone boulders at the top, in the late 19th century. It is still clear though overgrown. Halfway along this track there are several rock outcrop lookouts where good views south and west can be seen, the summit offering views northeast to southeast. Lyrebirds are often seen as well as pigeons and occasional wild turkeys.

A former bridle track, the now somewhat overgrown after a while track that starts on the west side of the Cordeaux Road carpark at the Kembla Lookout is known as the Bridle Track on most maps. It goes along the escarpment, just below the edge, and can be quite slippery in moist conditions, several stages requiring jumping from rock to rock, however for the most part it is accessible if careful. The track goes through Illawarra rainforest with Lyrebirds quite common as well as swamp wallabies. The track used to go all the way to the Unanderra - Moss Vale railway line but is now overgrown beyond several hundred metres or so.
