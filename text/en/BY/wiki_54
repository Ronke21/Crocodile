== Brussels-Capital Region ==
Due to its bilingual nature, hospitals in the Brussels-Capital Region can be either monolingual Dutch, monolingual French or bilingual depending on their nature. University hospitals belong to one of the two linguistic communities and are therefore monolingual Dutch or French by law. Other public hospitals managed by a public authority have to be bilingual by law. Private hospitals not managed by a public authority are legally not bound to either language, but most cater to both. However, all hospital emergency services in the Brussels-Capital Region (no matter if they&#x27;re part of a public or private hospital) are required to be bilingual, since patients transported by emergency ambulance do not have a free choice to which hospital they will be brought. Mind that this is only the &quot;de iure&quot; situation, &quot;de facto&quot; are some hospitals that are legally required to be bilingual seriously lacking in personnel that&#x27;s proficient in the other language. This list indicates whether hospitals or hospital networks are officially monolingual or bilingual. The name of the bilingual hospitals is also given in the two languages.

Additionally, hospitals where younger members of the Belgian royal family were born are indicated with an asterisk (*).

<doc id="708475" wikidata="Q2214799" url="?curid=708475" title="Salmon River (Lincoln County, Oregon)">
<text>The Salmon River flows from the Central Oregon Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. About long, it begins and ends in Lincoln County but also flows briefly through western Polk and southern Tillamook counties. Much of its course lies within the Siuslaw National Forest.

Rising in the mountains near the Lincoln–Polk county line, it flows east into Polk County, then north and west, re-entering Lincoln County, entering Tillamook County and re-entering Lincoln County near Oregon Route 18. It continues generally west-southwestward through the Siuslaw National Forest, turning west again to enter the Pacific near Cascade Head, about north of Lincoln City.

Following the river through the mountains, Route 18 connects to Sheridan, McMinnville and the South Yamhill River valley to the east and U.S. Route 101 to the west. The river and highway pass through the Van Duzer Forest Corridor State Wayside. The river supports populations of wild steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout, as well as chinook and coho salmon released each year from a hatchery at Otis.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries from source to mouth are the Little Salmon River, which enters from the right; Boulder Creek, left; Indian, Prairie, and Sulphur creeks, right; Deer Creek, left; Treat River, left; Alder Brook, right; Widow Creek, right.

Then Slick Rock and Bear creeks, left; Panther Creek, right; Willis Creek, left; Deer and Salmon creeks, right; Frazer and Rowdy creeks, left, and Crowley and Teal creeks, right.

<text>An augustalis or augustale, also agostaro, was a gold coin minted in the Kingdom of Sicily beginning in 1231. 

==History==

It was issued by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (from 1220) and King of Sicily (from 1198), and was minted until his death in 1250. In addition, a half augustalis was issued. It was identical in design, but smaller and half the weight. The augustalis bore a Latin inscription and was widely circulated in Italy. It was patterned after the Roman aureus. It was struck at Brindisi and Messina with accompanying billon deniers. The style of the augustalis has been described as splendid and proto-Renaissance; the quality of its execution and its fineness was high. The augustalis had a nominal weight of 5.31 grams and was 20 carats (854/1000) fine. The legal value was a quarter of a Sicilian gold ounce.

The obverse contains a classical (not medieval) profile bust of the emperor wearing a laureate wreath with the legend CESAR AVG IMP ROM (Caesar Augustus, Emperor of the Romans); the reverse shows an eagle, the imperial symbol, with the name FRIDE RICVS (Frederick). The name &quot;augustalis&quot; means literally &quot;of the august one&quot;, referring to the coin&#x27;s provenance from the emperor himself, but also linking it with the Roman Emperor, who was commonly styled Augustus.

<text>Blue Streak is a 1999 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Les Mayfield. Inspired by the 1965 film &quot;The Big Job&quot;, the film stars Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, Dave Chappelle, Peter Greene, Nicole Ari Parker and William Forsythe. Lawrence plays Miles, a jewel thief who tries to retrieve a diamond he left at a police station, whereupon he disguises himself as a detective and gets paired with a real policeman to investigate burglaries. The film was shot on location in California. The prime shooting spot was Sony Pictures Studios, which is located in Culver City, California.

&quot;Blue Streak&quot; was released theatrically by Columbia Pictures on September 17, 1999 and opened as the number one movie in North America. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it went on to gross nearly $120 million at the worldwide box office against a $36 million budget. The film&#x27;s soundtrack album, featuring a number of popular urban/hip-hop artists, was certified platinum.

==Plot==
Jewel thief Miles Logan participates in a $17 million diamond heist in LA with his crew: his right hand and best friend Eddie, getaway driver Tulley, and Deacon, a newly acquired member of the group. Deacon turns on them, killing Eddie by shooting him off of a tall building and causing him to fall onto a police car, before attempting to take the stone from Miles. As the police arrive, Miles hides the diamond in the ducts of a building under construction; as Deacon flees, Miles is arrested.

Released from prison two years later, Miles attempts to reunite with his girlfriend. She breaks it off as he lied about being a criminal, which prompts him to retrieve the diamond. Miles discovers the building where he hid the diamond is now an LAPD police station and goes inside. He realizes the diamond is hidden in the ducts of what is now the Robbery/Homicide detective bureau, which requires a key card to access.

Miles returns disguised as a pizza deliveryman, steals an access card and visits his forger Uncle Lou. The fake badge and transfer papers allow him to pose as newly transferred police detective Malone. While trying to access the ducts, Miles inadvertently foils a prisoner escape, and so he is teamed up with newly appointed Detective Carlson.

Miles&#x27; planned quick in-and-out mission to retrieve the diamond ends up becoming a prolonged endeavor as he gets sent out on calls. Miles&#x27; knowledge on criminal activity and ability to foil crimes makes him quite popular among his &quot;peers,” even getting promoted to detective in charge of the Robbery/Homicide division.

When Miles and Carlson are first sent on a burglary call, he quickly solves it as fraud perpetrated by the owner. On the ride back, they stumble upon an armed robbery being committed by Tulley. Miles intervenes, arresting him before he&#x27;s shot, but Tulley demands $50,000 to keep quiet about who Miles really is.

Miles again attempts to locate the diamond, but is interrupted by Carlson, who has discovered he is not who he claims to be. Convincing him that he is from Internal Affairs, Miles tries to get back to searching for the diamond, but they are sent out on another call. While out, they capture a truckload of heroin.

Afterwards, Miles finds the diamond in the evidence locker but accidentally drops it into the load of seized heroin. The FBI demands the heroin for testing. In panic, Miles suggests the FBI and his unit use it as bait in a sting. He arranges to be with the heroin in the delivery truck, but is soon joined by Tulley, whom he had set free from holding, and Deacon; during the drug deal, Deacon exposes Miles as a cop to the drug runners. While Miles and Tulley attempt to distract them, the police and FBI raid the deal. Deacon escapes with the diamond in an armored truck and the police and FBI follow as he approaches the border to Mexico. The US authorities are forced to halt their pursuit at the border, but Miles steals a patrol car and chases Deacon.

Miles forces Deacon to wreck the truck and offers him a deal: give him the diamond and let him arrest him in exchange for Miles cutting him back in on the diamond. He agrees, and Miles immediately double-crosses him by handcuffing him to the wrecked truck for the Federales and begins to walk back to the border. Deacon draws a gun to shoot him, but Miles turns and shoots him dead, avenging Eddie&#x27;s death.

Miles walks back to the border where both the FBI and police demand explanations; he tells them he is an undercover Mexican officer and has to report back to his fellow Federales. At a few inches from the border, Carlson and Hardcastle stop him, revealing they know who he really is, but do not arrest him as they are grateful for all of his help and see him as a friend.

They point out the FBI cannot reach him over international borders, as he is technically still in Mexico. Sharing a bittersweet goodbye, Miles heads off into Mexico with the diamond.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at #1 with a weekend gross of $19,208,806 from 2,735 theaters for a per venue average of $7,023. It ended its run with $68,518,533 in North America, and $49,239,967 internationally for a total of $117,758,500 worldwide.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Blue Streak&quot; had received mostly mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 35% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating based on reviews from 68 critics and an average rating of 4.80/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Martin Lawrence lends his comedic touch, but the movie isn&#x27;t much more than standard action-comedy fare.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Seymour of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film by saying that &quot;it starts out like a caper flick that shifts, almost by accident, into an episode from the old &quot;Martin&quot; TV series [until] eventually, it settles for being a bleached, cluttered photostat of &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, if only a bit more clever than the original.&quot; Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also compared the film to &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, and stated that &quot;in this instance, the buoyancy is only intermittent.&quot;
Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it 3 stars out of 4 and writing: &quot;Martin Lawrence is a comic actor with real talent, not always shown to best advantage. &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995), his cop buddy movie with Will Smith, was not a career high point, and it took a certain nerve to make another one. But &quot;Blue Streak&quot; works.&quot;

==Sequel==
There were plans for a sequel to &quot;Blue Streak&quot;, but the sequel did not materialize. A legacy sequel was announced on October 25, 2024.

== Remakes ==
The 2002 Hindi film &quot;Chor Machaaye Shor&quot; starring Bobby Deol was an unauthorized remake of &quot;Blue Streak&quot;. The storyline of the 2008 Indian Telugu language film &quot;Blade Babji&quot;, starring Allari Naresh and Sayali Bhagat was inspired by this film which was then remade in Tamil as &quot;Kasethan Kadavulada&quot; (2011) and in Kannada as &quot;Kiladi Kitty&quot; (2012). And the film was remade in Persian as &quot;Loneh Zanbor&quot; (2017) also.

<text>Nezikin ( &quot;Neziqin&quot;, &quot;Damages&quot;) or Seder Nezikin (, &quot;The Order of Damages&quot;) is the fourth Order of the Mishna (also the Tosefta and Talmud). It deals largely with Jewish criminal and civil law and the Jewish court system.

Nezikin contains ten volumes (or &quot;tractates&quot;):

#Bava Kamma (, &quot;First Gate&quot;) deals with civil matters, largely damages and compensation. 10 chapters. (See also Shomer)
#Bava Metzia (, &quot;Middle Gate&quot;) deals with civil matters, largely torts and property law. 10 chapters.
#Bava Batra (, &quot;Last Gate&quot;) deals with civil matters, largely land ownership. 10 chapters.
#Sanhedrin (, &quot;The Sanhedrin&quot;) deals with the rules of court proceedings in the Sanhedrin, the death penalty, and other criminal matters. 11 chapters.
#Makkot (, &quot;Lashes&quot;) deals with colluding witnesses, cities of refuge and the punishment of lashes. 3 chapters.
#Shevu&#x27;ot (, &quot;Oaths&quot;) deals with the various types of oaths and their consequences. 8 chapters.
#Eduyot (, &quot;Testimonies&quot;) presents case studies of legal disputes in Mishnaic times and the miscellaneous testimonies that illustrate various Sages and principles of halakha. 8 chapters.
#Avodah Zarah (, &quot;Foreign worship&quot;) deals with the laws of interactions between Jews and Gentiles and/or idolaters (from a Jewish perspective). 5 chapters.
#Avot (, &quot;Fathers&quot;) is a collection of the Sages&#x27; favourite ethical maxims. 6 chapters.
#Horayot (, &quot;Decisions&quot;) deals with the communal sin-offering brought for major errors by the Sanhedrin. 3 chapters.

Originally, the first three volumes were counted as one single, very lengthy volume. Since it was the chief repository of &quot;civil&quot; law, it was simply called &quot;Massekhet Nezikin&quot; (&quot;Tractate Damages&quot;).

The traditional reasoning for the order of the volumes of Nezikin is as follows: The Order begins with civil law (the first 3 tractates) because it is considered the cornerstone of righteousness within a Jewish state. Sanhedrin naturally follows, as it deals with criminal law. Next comes Makkot, as it is a continuation of Sanhedrin&#x27;s subject matter in terms of criminal procedure. Then, Shevuot, which continues the general topic dealt with in Makkot of the false testimony. After outlining the main points of civil and criminal law, Eduyot follows to fit it all into a halakhic framework. After dealing with &quot;damages&quot; within a society, the next stage is Avodah Zarah placed after to highlight what is seen as behavior that inflicts damage on the universe. Avot is probably placed next to counteract the negativity of the laws of Avodah Zarah and to relate maxims of the Sages, an essential aspect of whose teaching was to counteract idolatry. Finally, Horayot brings the discussion from lofty heights to a humble note, highlighting the concept that even the Sages and &quot;battei din&quot; can err.

There is both a Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud to each of the tractates except for Eduyot and Avot. This is probably because these two tractates aren&#x27;t concerned with individual laws and therefore don&#x27;t lend themselves to a Gemara style analysis.

<text>Tohorot () is the sixth and last order of the Mishnah (also of the Tosefta and Talmud). This order deals with the clean/unclean distinction and family purity. This is the longest of the orders in the Mishnah. There are 12 tractates:

#Keilim: (כלים &quot;Vessels&quot;); deals with a large array of various utensils and how they fare in terms of purity. 30 chapters, the longest in the Mishnah.
#Oholot: (אוהלות &quot;Tents&quot;); deals with the uncleanness from a corpse and its peculiar property of defiling people or objects either by the latter &quot;tenting&quot; over the corpse, or by the corpse &quot;tenting&quot; over them, or by the presence of both corpse and person or object under the same roof or tent.
#Nega&#x27;im: (נגעים &quot;Plagues&quot;); deals with the laws of the &quot;tzaraath&quot;.
#Parah: (פרה &quot;Cow&quot;); deals largely with the laws of the Red Heifer &quot;(Para Adumah)&quot;.
#Tohorot: (טהרות &quot;Purities&quot;); deals with miscellaneous laws of purity, especially the actual mechanics of contracting impurity and the laws of the impurity of food.
#Mikva&#x27;ot: (מקואות &quot;Ritual Baths&quot;); deals with the laws of the mikveh.
#Niddah: (נידה &quot;Separation&quot;); deals with the Niddah, a woman either during her menstrual cycle or shortly after having given birth.
#Makhshirin: (מכשירין &quot;Preliminary acts of preparation&quot;), the liquids that make food susceptible to &quot;tumah&quot; (ritual impurity).
#Zavim: (זבים &quot;Flows&quot;); deals with the laws of a person who has had abnormal genital discharge.
#Tevul Yom: (טבול יום &quot;Immersed [on that] day&quot;) deals with a special kind of impurity where the person immerses in a mikveh but is still unclean for the rest of the day.
#Yadayim: (ידיים &quot;Hands&quot;); deals with a Rabbinic impurity related to the hands.
#Uktzim: (עוקצים &quot;Stalks&quot;); deals with the impurity of the stalks of fruit.

==Order of tractates==
According to Maimonides, the traditional reasoning for the order of the tractates is as follows:
* &quot;Kelim&quot; is first as it introduces the levels of impurity, and dictates to which object the various impurities apply at all.
* &quot;Oholot&quot; follows because it outlines the most serious type of impurity. 
* &quot;Negaim&quot; follows because it is next in severity and because, like a corpse, a &quot;metzorah&quot; transmits tent-impurity. &quot;Parah&quot; follows as it outlines the purification for the severe impurities already dealt with.
* The next stage is lesser impurities (&quot;Tohorot&quot;) and their method of purification which is immersion (&quot;Mikvaot&quot;).
* &quot;Niddah&quot; follows as it is also a lesser impurity but it has the extra feature of applying to only a portion of people (i.e. to women).
* &quot;Makshirin&quot;, &quot;Zavim&quot; and &quot;Tevul Tom&quot; follow &quot;Niddah&quot; based on Scriptural order.
* The next stage down is &quot;Yadaim&quot;, concerning impurities that are Rabbinic only.
* &quot;Uktzin&quot; is last as it is restricted and has no Scriptural source, the laws being derived from the reasoning of the Sages.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, on the other hand, observed that the tractates are arranged in order of decreasing length. 

There is a Babylonian Gemara only on &quot;Niddah&quot;. This is because most of the other laws of purity do not apply when the Temple in Jerusalem is not in existence. The Jerusalem Talmud only covers four chapters of &quot;Niddah&quot;.

<text>This is a list of hospitals in Finland. The majority of the healthcare in Finland is offered by public service providers. The private sector is very small. Primary health care is offered in municipal health centers, whose services include physical examinations, oral health, medical care, ambulance services, maternity and child health clinics, school and student health care and other basic services. Specialized medical care, including outpatient and institutional treatment is provided by hospital districts.

<doc id="708503" wikidata="Q1806811" url="?curid=708503" title="Latah">
<text>Latah is a condition in which abnormal behaviors result from a person experiencing a sudden shock or other external stressor almost exclusively having been observed in persons from Southeast Asia. When induced, the affected person typically engages in such behaviors as screaming, cursing, dance movements, uncontrollable laughter, mimicry and command obedience. Physical symptoms include an increased heart rate and profuse sweating, but no clear physiological causality beyond the apparent relationship between sudden shock and/or severe emotional stress have been identified. Since no research has emerged indicating whether the behavior is caused by a genetic disorder unique to those of Southeast Asian ancestry, a set of psychosomatic symptoms triggered by Southeast Asian cultural anthropological factors, or another cause not yet hypothesized, the cause has remained undetermined. 

Latah was initially considered a culture-specific startle disorder that was historically regarded as personal difference rather than an illness. Similar conditions have been recorded within other cultures and locations. For example, there are the so-called Jumping Frenchmen of Maine, &quot;imu&quot; among women of the Ainu people of Japan, &quot;mali-mali&quot; or &quot;silok&quot; among Filipinos, and &quot;bat-schi&quot; () among Thais; however, the connection among these syndromes is controversial.

==Earliest record==
The earliest mention of latah is in J. R. Logan&#x27;s journal from 1849 when he traveled from Melaka to Naning. Though this is only a possible reference, by the 1860s, latah had been clearly identified in Malaya and Java. Seen first as merely a &quot;cerebral affection&quot;, little was understood about latah during this time. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s notes from the early- to mid-1880s are the first gathering of information on latah recorded. He observed that latah was more common in women than men, and more likely to occur in more mature, rather than younger, women. From many of the original accounts of European travelers, latah does not seem to have changed much in either affected demographic population nor in symptoms.

The British colonial administrator Frank Swettenham wrote about latah in his volume of essays &quot;Malay Sketches&quot; (1895). Swettenham describes how two policemen from Ambon Island stationed in Selangor in 1874 who were affected with the condition were made the victims of pranks by their colleagues.

==Signs and symptoms==
Latah can affect people differently; someone can have a very strong reaction or a slight reaction during a latah episode. Every instance of latah has been acquired over time. Those who are affected, which by an overwhelming number are middle-aged to older women, are not born latah. It typically occurs around the time of menopause. There is a lack of latah in the higher social strata of Malay and Java, which suggests they are more likely to suppress their responses than those who belong to lower social classes.

A latah episode occurs after being startled (poking, shouting, something falling). During an episode, a latah person will begin to shout obscenities, imitate words or gestures of those around them or even those on TV, and will often obey any commands given to them – no matter how outrageous or against cultural norms they are. Persons with latah make movements reminiscent of behaviors normally peculiar to certain childhood developmental stages. The person is unlikely to remember anything occurring during the episode.

==Malay perspective==
When Malays were asked why they thought that women were more likely to suffer from latah, they responded with the cultural explanation that women have less &quot;semangat&quot; or soul substance. They also said women are simply easier to tease than men, and coupling these two together, latah becomes more readily observable and developed throughout recurrent provocation in women than in men. This also accounts for the higher prevalence of latah in lower status persons, as they are more vulnerable to abuse than others. The Malay also believe women are more susceptible because they lose more blood than men, through menstruation. Some Malay believe that excess tickling of a child will predispose them to latah later in life.

In Kamus Dewan, an authoritative Malay dictionary with definitions in Malay, &quot;melatah&quot; is defined as &quot;to involuntarily say or do things because of surprise&quot;.

==In the DSM==
Latah was included in &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) IV under the &quot;Dissociative Disorder: Not Otherwise Specified&quot; section as a culture-bound syndrome. DSM IV describes latah as a hypersensitivity to sudden fright, often with echopraxia, echolalia, command obedience, and dissociative or trancelike behavior. It mentions other cultures where latah is found, but the only further information the DSM-IV provides is that in Malaysia, it is more often found in middle-aged women. It has been removed from DSM-5, and rather than the DSM-5 expanding upon the DSM IV&#x27;s list of culture-bound syndromes, it has instead provided cross-lists for more commonly known disorders that a culture-bound syndrome might be classified as. DSM-5 has taken out the &quot;culture-bound syndrome&quot; language and replaced it with more &quot;sensitive&quot; language, and the glossary where the now shortened list of previously recognized culture-bound syndromes is titled &quot;Other Specified&quot; and &quot;Unspecified&quot; dissociative disorders. A more general discussion, involving the formation of a cultural identity, explanation, and assessment, has been added.

==In popular culture==
William S. Burroughs mentions latah several times in his 1959 novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, &quot;a parody of modern mass man under modern conditioning programmes of advertising and public[ly] induced morality&quot;, according to Eric Mottram. Burroughs described latah as involving echopraxia, as well as being forcibly induced rather than spontaneously occurring. Latah is also mentioned in Burroughs&#x27; 1963 novel &quot;The Yage Letters&quot;.

==Possible causes==
The onset of latah is often associated with stress. In a study done by Tanner and Chamberland in 2001, a significant number of research participants had experienced a life stressor (such as a child or husband dying) just before becoming latah. Additionally, a large number of participants from many research studies have reported strange dreams occurring just before the onset of latah. These dreams usually had a sexual element to them, often involving penises. According to Tanner and Chamberland, perhaps the dreams, although with variation, indicate some sort of dysfunction in a specific anatomical area. Exploring this further might lead to more insights as to the cause and/or cure of latah. Osborne (2001) states that latah is a possible emotional outlet in a stifling culture. Winzeler&#x27;s believes that latah is less demeaning for women than it is for men, and that women actually have more freedom in society because they are not held to as strict of standards as men are. He argues that as men age, they become more concerned with personal dignity and poise while women become less so. Because of this, women feel more freedom to engage in latah behavior, while men do not.

<text>This is a list of hospitals in France with sorting by city and name. As of 2004, about 62% of French hospital capacity was met by publicly owned and managed hospitals. The remaining capacity was split evenly (18% each) between non-profit sector hospitals (which are linked to the public sector and which tend to be owned by foundations, religious organizations or mutual-insurance associations) and by for-profit institutions. Because the insurance is compulsory, the system is effectively financed by general taxation rather than traditional insurance (as typified by auto or home insurance, where risk levels determine premiums).

<text>World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF, ), or World Wide Organization of Organic Farms, is a network of national organizations that facilitate homestays on organic farms. There is no central list or organization that encompasses all WWOOF hosts. As there is no single international WWOOF membership, all recognized WWOOF country organizations strive to maintain similar standards, and cooperate together to promote the aims of WWOOF.

WWOOF provides volunteers (often called &quot;WWOOFers&quot; or &quot;woofers&quot;, ) with enough experience in organic and ecologically sound growing methods to help the organic movement. They let volunteers experience life in a rural setting or in a different nation. WWOOF volunteers generally do not receive a salary in exchange for services. The host provides food, lodging, and opportunities to learn, in exchange for assistance with farming or gardening activities for the host.

The duration of the visit can range from days to years. Workdays average five to six hours, and participants interact with WWOOFers from other countries. WWOOF farms include private gardens through smallholdings, allotments, and commercial farms. Farms become WWOOF hosts by enlisting with their regional organization. In countries with no WWOOF organization, farms enlist with WWOOF Independents.

==History==

WWOOF originally stood for &quot;Working Weekends On Organic Farms&quot; and began in England in 1971. Sue Coppard, a woman working as a secretary in London, wanted to provide urban dwellers with access to the countryside while supporting the organic movement. Her idea started with a trial of working weekends for four people at the biodynamic farm at Emerson College in Sussex. People soon started volunteering for longer periods than just weekends, so the name was changed to Willing Workers On Organic Farms. Eventually, the word &quot;work&quot; caused problems with some countries&#x27; labor laws and immigration authorities, who tended to treat WWOOFers as migrant workers and oppose foreigners competing for local jobs. (Many WWOOFers enter countries on tourist visas, which is illegal in countries such as the United States.) Both in an attempt to circumvent this and also in recognition of WWOOFing&#x27;s worldwide scope, the name was changed again in 2000 to &quot;World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms&quot;. Some WWOOF groups (such as Australia) choose to retain the older name, however.

==Volunteering==
Volunteers choose which country they would like to visit and volunteer in and it is their responsibility to contact the relevant organization to arrange the dates and duration of their stay at selected farms. The duration of a volunteer&#x27;s stay can range from days to months, but is typically one to two weeks. Volunteers usually work for 4–6 hours a day in return for a one day&#x27;s worth of food on top of accommodation. Volunteers are expected to assist with a variety of tasks, including but not limited to; sowing seed, making compost, gardening, planting, cutting wood, weeding, harvesting, packing, milking, feeding, fencing, making mud-bricks, wine making, cheese making, and bread baking.

<text>Internal combustion engine cooling uses either air or liquid to remove the waste heat from an internal combustion engine. For small or special purpose engines, cooling using air from the atmosphere makes for a lightweight and relatively simple system. Watercraft can use water directly from the surrounding environment to cool their engines. For water-cooled engines on aircraft and surface vehicles, waste heat is transferred from a closed loop of water pumped through the engine to the surrounding atmosphere by a radiator.

Water has a higher heat capacity than air, and can thus move heat more quickly away from the engine, but a radiator and pumping system add weight, complexity, and cost. Higher-power engines generate more waste heat, but can move more weight, meaning they are generally water-cooled. Radial engines allow air to flow around each cylinder directly, giving them an advantage for air cooling over straight engines, flat engines, and V engines. Rotary engines have a similar configuration, but the cylinders also continually rotate, creating an air flow even when the vehicle is stationary.

Aircraft design more strongly favors lower weight and air-cooled designs. Rotary engines were popular on aircraft until the end of World War I, but had serious stability and efficiency problems. Radial engines were popular until the end of World War II, until gas turbine engines largely replaced them. Modern propeller-driven aircraft with internal-combustion engines are still largely air-cooled. Modern cars generally favor power over weight, and typically have water-cooled engines. Modern motorcycles are lighter than cars and both cooling methods are common. Some sport motorcycles were cooled with both air and oil (sprayed underneath the piston heads).

== Overview ==
Heat engines generate mechanical power by extracting energy from heat flows, much as a water wheel extracts mechanical power from a flow of mass falling through a distance. Engines are inefficient, so more heat energy enters the engine than comes out as mechanical power; the difference is waste heat which must be removed. Internal combustion engines remove waste heat through cool intake air, hot exhaust gasses, and explicit engine cooling.

Engines with higher efficiency have more energy leave as mechanical motion and less as waste heat. Some waste heat is essential: it guides heat through the engine, much as a water wheel works only if there is some exit velocity (energy) in the waste water to carry it away and make room for more water. Thus all heat engines need cooling to operate.

Cooling is also needed because high temperatures damage engine materials and lubricants and becomes even more important in hot climates. Internal-combustion engines burn fuel hotter than the melting temperature of engine materials, and hot enough to set fire to lubricants. Engine cooling removes energy fast enough to keep temperatures low so the engine can survive.

Some high-efficiency engines run without explicit cooling and with only incidental heat loss, a design called adiabatic. Such engines can achieve high efficiency but compromise power output, duty cycle, engine weight, durability, and emissions.

== Basic principles ==
Most internal combustion engines are fluid cooled using either air (a gaseous fluid) or a liquid coolant run through a heat exchanger (radiator) cooled by air. Marine engines and some stationary engines have ready access to a large volume of water at a suitable temperature. The water may be used directly to cool the engine, but often has sediment, which can clog coolant passages, or chemicals, such as salt which can chemically damage the engine. Thus, engine coolant may be run through a heat exchanger that is cooled by the body of water.

Most liquid-cooled engines use a mixture of water and chemicals such as antifreeze, rust inhibitors, and other additives. These antifreeze mixtures, also known as &quot;engine coolant,&quot; are typically glycol-based fluids that contain a mixture of ethylene glycol, additives, and water. Common types of coolants include Inorganic Acid Technology (IAT), Organic Acid Technology (OAT), and Hybrid Organic Acid Technology (HOAT) fluids. Some antifreezes use no water at all, instead relying on liquids with different properties, such as propylene glycol or a combination of propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. While air-cooled engines primarily rely on air to regulate temperature, many also use oil cooling to help maintain optimal temperatures for both engine components and the oil itself. Most liquid-cooled engines use some air cooling, with the intake stroke of air cooling the combustion chamber. An exception is in a Wankel engine, where some parts of the combustion chamber are never cooled by intake, requiring extra effort for successful operation.

There are many demands on a cooling system. One key requirement is to adequately serve the entire engine, as the whole engine fails if just one part overheats. Therefore, it is vital that the cooling system keep all parts at suitably low temperatures. Liquid-cooled engines are able to vary the size of their passageways through the engine block so that coolant flow may be tailored to the needs of each area. Locations with either high peak temperatures (narrow islands around the combustion chamber) or high heat flow (around exhaust ports) may require generous cooling. This reduces the occurrence of hot spots, which are more difficult to avoid with air cooling. Air-cooled engines may also vary their cooling capacity by using more closely spaced cooling fins in that area, but this can make their manufacture difficult and expensive.

Only the fixed parts of the engine, such as the block and head, are cooled directly by the main coolant system. Moving parts such as the pistons, and to a lesser extent the crankshaft and connecting rods, must rely on the lubrication oil as a coolant, or to a very limited amount of conduction into the block and thence the main coolant. High performance engines frequently have additional oil, beyond the amount needed for lubrication, sprayed upwards onto the bottom of the piston just for extra cooling. Air-cooled motorcycles often rely heavily on oil-cooling in addition to air-cooling of the cylinder barrels.

Liquid-cooled engines usually have a circulation pump. The first engines relied on thermosiphon cooling alone, where hot coolant left the top of the engine block and passed to the radiator, where it was cooled before returning to the bottom of the engine. Circulation was powered by convection alone.

Other demands include cost, weight, reliability, and durability of the cooling system itself.

Conductive heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference between materials. If engine metal is at 250 °C and the air is at 20 °C, then there is a 230 °C temperature difference for cooling. An air-cooled engine uses all of this difference. In contrast, a liquid-cooled engine might dump heat from the engine to a liquid, heating the liquid to 135 °C (water&#x27;s standard boiling point of 100 °C can be exceeded as the cooling system is both pressurised, and uses a mixture with antifreeze) which is then cooled with 20 °C air. In each step, the liquid-cooled engine has half the temperature difference and so at first appears to need twice the cooling area.

However, properties of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. As example which compares water and oil as coolants, one gram of oil can absorb about 55% of the heat for the same rise in temperature (called the specific heat capacity). Oil has about 90% the density of water, so a given volume of oil can absorb only about 50% of the energy of the same volume of water. The thermal conductivity of water is about four times that of oil, which can aid heat transfer. The viscosity of oil can be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to pump oil for cooling, and reducing the net power output of the engine.

Comparing air and water, air has vastly lower heat capacity per gram and per volume (4000) and less than a tenth the conductivity, but also much lower viscosity (about 200 times lower: 17.4 × 10−6 Pa·s for air vs 8.94 × 10−4 Pa·s for water).
Continuing the calculation from two paragraphs above, air cooling needs ten times of the surface area, therefore the fins, and air needs 2000 times the flow velocity and thus a recirculating air fan needs ten times the power of a recirculating water pump.

Moving heat from the cylinder to a large surface area for air cooling can present problems including difficulties manufacturing the shapes needed for good heat transfer and the space needed for free flow of a large volume of air. Water boils at about the same temperature desired for engine cooling. This has an advantage in that it absorbs a great deal of energy with very little rise in temperature (called heat of vaporization), which is good for keeping things cool, especially for passing one stream of coolant over several hot objects and achieving uniform temperature. In contrast, passing air over several hot objects in series warms the air at each step, so the first may be over-cooled and the last under-cooled. However, once water boils, it is an insulator, leading to a sudden loss of cooling where steam bubbles form. Steam may return to water as it mixes with other coolant, so an engine temperature gauge can indicate an acceptable temperature even though local temperatures are high enough that damage is being done.

An engine needs different temperatures. The inlet including the compressor of a turbo and in the inlet trumpets and the inlet valves need to be as cold as possible. A countercurrent heat exchanger with forced cooling air does the job. The cylinder-walls should not heat up the air before compression, but also not cool down the gas at the combustion. A compromise is a wall temperature of 90 °C. The viscosity of the oil is optimized for just this temperature. Any cooling of the exhaust and the turbine of the turbocharger reduces the amount of power available to the turbine, so the exhaust system is often insulated between engine and turbocharger to keep the exhaust gasses as hot as possible.

The temperature of the cooling air may range from well below freezing to 50 °C. Further, while engines in long-haul boat or rail service may operate at a steady load, road vehicles often see widely varying and quickly varying load. Thus, the cooling system is designed to vary cooling so the engine is neither too hot nor too cold. Cooling system regulation includes adjustable baffles in the air flow (sometimes called &#x27;shutters&#x27; and commonly run by a pneumatic &#x27;shutterstat&#x27;); a fan which operates either independently of the engine, such as an electric fan, or which has an adjustable clutch; and a thermostatic valve or a thermostat that can block the coolant flow when too cool. In addition, the motor, coolant, and heat exchanger have some heat capacity which smooths out temperature increase in short sprints. Some engine controls shut down an engine or limit it to half throttle if it overheats. Modern electronic engine controls adjust cooling based on throttle to anticipate a temperature rise, and limit engine power output to compensate for finite cooling.

Finally, other concerns may dominate cooling system design. As example, air is a relatively poor coolant, but air cooling systems are simple, and failure rates typically rise as the square of the number of failure points. Also, cooling capacity is reduced only slightly by small air coolant leaks. Where reliability is of utmost importance, as in aircraft, it may be a good trade-off to give up efficiency, longevity (interval between engine rebuilds), and quietness in order to achieve slightly higher reliability; the consequences of a broken airplane engine are so severe, even a slight increase in reliability is worth giving up other good properties to achieve it.

Air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines are both used commonly. Each principle has advantages and disadvantages, and particular applications may favor one over the other. For example, most cars and trucks use liquid-cooled engines, while many small airplane and low-cost engines are air-cooled.

== Generalization difficulties ==
It is difficult to make generalizations about air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines. Air-cooled diesel engines are chosen for reliability even in extreme heat, because air-cooling would be simpler and more effective at coping with the extremes of temperatures during the depths of winter and height of summer, than water cooling systems, and are often used in situations where the engine runs unattended for months at a time.

Similarly, it is usually desirable to minimize the number of heat transfer stages in order to maximize the temperature difference at each stage. However, Detroit Diesel two-stroke cycle engines commonly use oil cooled by water, with the water in turn cooled by air.

The coolant used in many liquid-cooled engines must be renewed periodically and can freeze at ordinary temperatures thus causing permanent engine damage when it expands. Air-cooled engines do not require coolant service, and do not suffer damage from freezing, two commonly cited advantages for air-cooled engines. However, coolant based on propylene glycol is liquid to −55 °C, colder than is encountered by many engines; shrinks slightly when it crystallizes, thus avoiding damage; and has a service life over 10,000 hours, essentially the lifetime of many engines.

It is usually more difficult to achieve either low emissions or low noise from an air-cooled engine, two more reasons most road vehicles use liquid-cooled engines. It is also often difficult to build large air-cooled engines, so nearly all air-cooled engines are under 500 kW (670 hp), whereas large liquid-cooled engines exceed 80 MW (107000 hp) (Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C 14-cylinder diesel).

== Air-cooling==


Cars and trucks using direct air cooling (without an intermediate liquid) were built over a long period from the very beginning and ending with a small and generally unrecognized technical change. Before World War II, water-cooled cars and trucks routinely overheated while climbing mountain roads, creating geysers of boiling cooling water. That was considered normal, and at the time, most noted mountain roads had auto repair shops to minister to overheating engines.

ACS (Auto Club Suisse) maintains historical monuments to that era on the Susten Pass where two radiator refill stations remain. They have instructions on a cast metal plaque and a spherical bottom watering can hanging next to a water spigot. The spherical bottom was intended to keep it from being set down thus being useless around the house, in spite of which it was stolen, as the picture shows.

During that period, European firms such as Magirus-Deutz built air-cooled diesel trucks, Porsche built air-cooled farm tractors and Volkswagen became famous with air-cooled passenger cars. In the United States, Franklin built air-cooled engines.

For many years air cooling was favored for military applications as liquid cooling systems are more vulnerable to damage by shrapnel.

The Czech Republic–based company Tatra is known for their large displacement air-cooled V8 car engines; Tatra engineer Julius Mackerle published a book on it. Air-cooled engines are better adapted to extremely cold and hot environmental weather temperatures: you can see air-cooled engines starting and running in freezing conditions that seized water-cooled engines and continue working when water-cooled ones start producing steam jets. Air-cooled engines possibly have an advantage from a thermodynamic point of view due to higher operating temperature. The worst problem met in air-cooled aircraft engines was the so-called &quot;shock cooling&quot;, when the airplane entered in a dive after climbing or level flight with throttle open, with the engine under no load while the airplane dives generating less heat, and the flow of air that cools the engine is increased, a catastrophic engine failure may result as different parts of engine have different temperatures, and thus different thermal expansions. In such conditions, the engine may seize, and any sudden change or imbalance in the relation between heat produced by the engine and heat dissipated by cooling may result in an increased wear of engine, as a consequence also of thermal expansion differences between parts of engine, liquid-cooled engines having more stable and uniform working temperatures.

==Liquid cooling==

Today, most automotive and larger IC engines are liquid-cooled.

Liquid cooling is also employed in maritime vehicles (vessels, ...). For vessels, the seawater itself is mostly used for cooling. In some cases chemical coolants are also employed (in closed systems) or they are mixed with seawater cooling.

==Transition from air cooling==
The change of air cooling to liquid cooling occurred at the start of World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived durability tests, but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated &quot;rope&quot; seal (gland) on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water to the top of the radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.

After isolating the pump problem, cars and trucks built for the war effort (no civilian cars were built during that time) were equipped with carbon-seal water pumps that did not leak and caused no more geysers. Meanwhile, air cooling advanced in memory of boiling engines even though boil-over was no longer a common problem. Air-cooled engines became popular throughout Europe. After the war, Volkswagen advertised in the US as not boiling over, even though new water-cooled cars no longer boiled over, but the cars sold well. But as air quality awareness rose in the 1960s and laws governing exhaust emissions were passed, unleaded gas replaced leaded gas and leaner fuel mixtures became the norm. Subaru chose liquid-cooling for their EA series (flat) engine when it was introduced in 1966.

==Low heat rejection engines==
A special class of experimental prototype internal combustion piston engines have been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss. The engines are variously called adiabatic engines, due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion, low heat rejection engines, or high-temperature engines. They are generally diesel engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Some make use of titanium pistons and other titanium parts due to its low thermal conductivity and mass. Some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether. Developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization.

<text>Menahem Pressler (; 16 December 1923 – 6 May 2023) was a German-born Israeli-American pianist and academic teacher. He was known for his work with the Beaux Arts Trio that he co-founded in 1955, playing until its dissolution in 2008, in hundreds of recordings and thousands of concerts. He taught at Indiana University Bloomington. His playing was described as focused on elegance, delicacy and clarity.

==Early life==
He was born Max Jakob Pressler in Magdeburg on 16 December 1923. His Jewish parents owned a shop for men&#x27;s clothing that was destroyed in the Kristallnacht of 9–10 November 1938. His family fled Nazi Germany in 1939, initially to Italy, and then to Palestine. Pressler suffered from eating disorders and was in danger of starvation, but later said that playing the piano cured him. His grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins all died in concentration camps.

Pressler, who took the name Menahem, participated in the Debussy International Piano Competition in San Francisco in 1946. Winning first prize launched his career, and he moved to the US. His Carnegie Hall debut subsequently followed in 1947, playing Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy.

==Career==
Pressler pursued a career as a soloist. He toured playing with leading orchestras in North America and Europe, in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Brussels, Helsinki, London, Oslo, and Paris. From 1955, Pressler taught on the piano faculty at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University Bloomington, where he held the rank of Distinguished Professor of Music as the Charles Webb Chair. His debut as a chamber musician was at the 1955 Berkshire Festival, where he appeared as the pianist with violinist Daniel Guilet and cellist Bernard Greenhouse. They met to record a cycle of Mozart&#x27;s piano trios. It proved so successful that they stayed together as the Beaux Arts Trio. He was the only original member to perform with the group through its entire existence, including several changes of membership, up to disbanding in 2008. 

The trio performed in hundreds of recordings and thousands of concerts. They began recording a cycle of the piano trios by Maurice Ravel and Gabriel Fauré. Their repertoire also included contemporary music by Charles Ives and Ned Rorem, among others, and they played ensemble music for six and even eight players.

Pressler returned to Germany in 2008 on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht. In 2010, he played at the Rheingau Musik Festival with Antônio Meneses, the last cellist of the Beaux Arts Trio, and appeared before in the interview series &quot;Rendezvous&quot;. In December 2013, aged 90, he made his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic at their New Year&#x27;s Eve concert. The performance was televised live throughout the world.

At the beginning of the 1950s, Pressler recorded a substantial quantity of solo piano music, and of music for piano and orchestra by various composers for the American label MGM. The Beaux Arts Trio made an extensive series of recordings for Philips. In addition, Pressler recorded solo piano music commercially on the La Dolce Volta label and Deutsche Grammophon. In 2018, a recording of French music was dedicated to his constant companion Annabelle Whitestone, Baroness Weidenfeld.

==Personal life==
Pressler was married to Sara Scherchen from 1949 until her death in 2014, and they had two children. In 2016, he began a relationship with Annabelle Whitestone Baroness Weidenfeld, whom he had known since 1966.

Pressler divided his time between Bloomington, Indiana, and London. He died in London on 6 May 2023, at age 99.

==Awards and recognition==
Among his honors and awards, Pressler received honorary doctorates from the University of Nebraska, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the Royal Academy of Music in London, the North Carolina School of the Arts, and the Ben Gurion University.

In 2005, Pressler received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the nation&#x27;s highest honour, and was named a Commandeur in the Order of Arts and Letters award. He was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance, in recognition of a lifetime of performance and leadership in music, in 2007.

He was nominated for five Grammy Awards. He received a Chamber Music America&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award, the Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Pressler received lifetime achievement awards from &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, the International Classical Music Awards, ECHO Classic in Germany and Les Victoires de la Musique Classique in France.

<doc id="708535" wikidata="Q316505" url="?curid=708535" title="Dmitry Bortniansky">
<text>Dmitry Stepanovich Bortniansky (28 October 1751 – ) was a Russian Imperial composer of Ukrainian Cossack origin. He was also a harpsichordist and conductor who served at the court of Catherine the Great. Bortniansky was critical to the musical history of both Russia and Ukraine, with both nations claiming him as their own.

Bortniansky, who has been compared to Palestrina, is known today for his liturgical works and prolific contributions to the genre of choral concertos. He was one of the &quot;Golden Three&quot; of his era, alongside Artemy Vedel and Maxim Berezovsky. Bortniansky was so popular in the Russian Empire that his figure was represented in 1862 in the bronze monument of the Millennium of Russia in the Novgorod Kremlin. He composed in many different musical styles, including choral compositions in French, Italian, Latin, German, and Church Slavonic.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Dmitry Bortniansky was born on 28 October 1751 in the city of Glukhov, Cossack Hetmanate, Russian Empire (present-day Hlukhiv, Sumy Oblast, Ukraine). His father was Stefan Skurat (or Shkurat), a Lemko-Rusyn Orthodox religious refugee from the village of Bartne in the Małopolska region of Poland. Skurat served as a Cossack under Kirill Razumovski; he was entered in the Cossack register in 1755. Dmitry&#x27;s mother was of Cossack origin; her name after her first marriage was Marina Dmitrievna Tolstaya, as a widow of a Russian landlord Tolstoy, who lived in Glukhov. 

At age seven, Dmitry&#x27;s prodigious talent at the local church choir opened him the opportunity to move to Saint Petersburg, the capital of the empire, and join the Imperial Chapel Choir. Dmitry&#x27;s half-brother Ivan Tolstoy also sang with the Imperial Chapel Choir. Dmitry studied music and composition under the guidance of the Imperial Chapel Choir director Baldassare Galuppi. In 1769 Galuppi left for Italy and took the boy with him.

=== Rise to fame ===
In Italy Bortniansky gained considerable success composing operas: &quot;Creonte&quot; (1776) and &quot;Alcide&quot; (1778) in Venice, and &quot;Quinto Fabio&quot; (1779) at Modena. He also composed sacred works in Latin and German, both a cappella and with orchestral accompaniment, including an &quot;Ave Maria&quot; for two voices and orchestra.

Bortniansky returned to the Saint Petersburg Court Capella in 1779. He composed at least four more operas in French, with libretti by Franz-Hermann Lafermière: &quot;Le Faucon&quot; (1786), &quot;La fête du seigneur&quot; (1786), &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1786) , and &quot;Le fils-rival ou La moderne Stratonice&quot; (1787). Bortniansky wrote a number of instrumental works at this time, including piano sonatas, a piano quintet with a harp, and a cycle of French songs. He also composed liturgical music for the Eastern Orthodox Church, combining the Eastern and Western European styles of sacred music, incorporating the polyphony he learned in Italy; some works were polychoral, using a style descended from the Venetian polychoral technique of Gabrieli.

In 1796 Bortniansky was appointed as a director of the Imperial Chapel Choir, the first director from the Russian Empire. With such a great instrument at his disposal, he produced scores upon scores of compositions, including over 100 religious works, sacred concertos (35 for a four-part mixed choir, 10 for double choruses), cantatas, and hymns.

=== Death ===
Bortniansky died in St. Petersburg on 10 October 1825, and was interred at the Smolensky Cemetery in St. Petersburg. His remains were transferred to the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the 20th century.

==Legacy==
In 1882, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky edited Bortniansky&#x27;s liturgical works, which were published in ten volumes. Bortniansky wrote operas and instrumental compositions, but his sacred choral works are performed most often today. This vast body of work remains central not only to understanding 18th-century Orthodox sacred music, but also subsequently influenced Russian and Ukrainian composers in the 19th century.

The tune he wrote for the Latin hymn &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot; eventually became known in Slavic lands as &quot;Коль славен (Kol Slaven)&quot;, in which form it is still sung as a church hymn today. The tune was also popular with Freemasons. It travelled to English-speaking countries and came to be known by the names &quot;Russia&quot;, &quot;St. Petersburg&quot; or &quot;Wells&quot;. In Germany, the song was paired with a text by Gerhard Tersteegen and became a well-known chorale and traditional part of the military ceremony &quot;Großer Zapfenstreich (the Grand Tattoo)&quot;, the highest ceremonial act of the German army, rendered as an honor for distinguished persons on special occasions. Before the October Revolution in 1917, the tune was played by the Kremlin carillon every day at midday.

James Blish, who novelized many episodes of the original series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, noted in one story, &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;, that Bortniansky&#x27;s &quot;Ich bete an die Macht der Liebe&quot; was the theme &quot;to which all Starfleet Academy classes marched to their graduation.&quot;

Bortniansky composed &quot;The Angel Greeted the Gracious One&quot; (hymn to the Mother of God used at Pascha) as a trio used by many Orthodox churches in the Easter season.

== Influence ==

Bortniansky&#x27;s work had a significant impact on the development of Russian and Ukrainian music.

Almost half a century of Bortniansky&#x27;s life was associated with music education, with the most important processes of the formation of musical culture in Russian Empire According to Russian musicologist Boris Asafyev, &quot;Bortniansky developed a style with characteristic inversions, which retained its influence for several following generations. These typical appeals not only reached Mikhail Glinka, but also Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Alexander Borodin&quot;.

At the same time, beginning in the 1920s, Bortniansky&#x27;s work became the subject of special attention from Ukrainian musicians. Stanyslav Lyudkevych&#x27;s article &quot;D. Bortniansky and Contemporary Ukrainian Music&quot; (1925) called on Ukrainian musicians to develop the traditions established by Bortniansky, &quot;to dive deeper and more thoroughly into the great cultural treasury concentrated in Bortniansky&#x27;s works, to find the sources in it and foundations of our revival&quot;. 

Traditionally, Ukrainian musicologists emphasize the use of intonations of Ukrainian folk songs in choral work, since the composer&#x27;s first musical impressions were obtained in Ukraine. Most of Bortniansky&#x27;s friends in the choir were Ukrainian, as was his teacher Mark Poltoratsky. In particular, Lydia Korniy notes: 
*typical for Ukrainian songs descending lyrical sixth V - VII # - I degree (on the example of choral concerts: № 13, end of the II part, and № 28, finale)
*typical inversions with a reduced fourth between III and VII # degrees in minor,
*typical for lyrical songs mournful intonations with an increased second between III and IV # degrees in minor.
Lyudkevych also notes Ukrainian intonations in Bortniansky&#x27;s works:
The influence of Bortniansky&#x27;s work is noted in the works of Ukrainian composers Mykola Lysenko, Kyrylo Stetsenko, Mykhailo Verbytskyi, Mykola Leontovych, M. Dremlyuga, Levko Revutsky, K. Dominchen, Borys Lyatoshynsky, and others.

<text>Victoria Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford in Victoria, Australia. Victoria Park is an elevated unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 May 1888, with the current platforms provided in 1959 and station provided in 1981.

Initially opened as Collingwood, the station was given its current name of Victoria Park on 1 May 1909. A former goods yard is located adjacent to Platform 1, whilst a stabling siding, capable of holding two stabled trains, is located at the down (northern) end of the station.

==History==

Victoria Park station opened on 8 May 1888 and, until 1901, the station was the terminus of the Collingwood to Heidelberg railway line. Until a direct connection with the Melbourne CBD was opened in 1901 between Princes Bridge and Collingwood Town Hall, the only connection to the city centre was via the indirect Inner Circle line.

On 21 March 1959, the station platforms were damaged by a fire that occurred at a nearby timber yard.

In 1981, the present pebbledash station buildings were provided, with the original timber pylons that supported the former buildings removed soon after.

The station is adjacent to Victoria Park, the former home of the Collingwood Football Club between 1892 and 1999. Large numbers of people used Victoria Park station to travel to and from AFL matches played at the stadium.

Announced as part of a $21.9 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Victoria Park, alongside other stations, will receive accessibility upgrades, the installation of CCTV and platform shelters. The development process will begin in late 2022 or 2023, with a timeline for the upgrades to be released once construction has begun.

==Platforms and services==

Victoria Park has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda and Hurstbridge line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda
* all stations and limited express services to Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

<text>Clifton Hill railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction point on the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Clifton Hill, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Clifton Hill station is a ground-level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 May 1888, with the current station provided in 1990.

Immediately to the north of the station, the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines diverge.

== History ==

Clifton Hill station opened on 8 May 1888, when a railway line between Collingwood and Heidelberg was provided. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the farm &quot;Clifton&quot;, which was named in 1841 by early landowner John Docker. Land speculator John Knipe later named the area Clifton Hill.

In December 1981, the station building was damaged by fire, although the heritage-registered verandah escaped serious damage. In 1990, the station was renovated, with a matching verandah built on the western platform (Platform 2). In 1992, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Ramsden Street level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station. Signal boxes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were also abolished in May of that year, with semaphore signals replaced by coloured light signals. On 25 June 1996, Clifton Hill was upgraded to a premium station.

Clifton Hill is listed on the Register of the National Estate as an intact example of a Victorian Tudor-style suburban railway station, and is one of eleven that were originally built between 1887 and 1889. It is the only example that still retains the original corrugated iron wings on either side of the main building. The timber verandah on the eastern platform (Platform 1) is also considered architecturally rare. Other features of the complex include two timber-framed gabled roofed signal boxes (built in 1888 and 1901 respectively), located on either side of Platform 2, and the original swinging railway gates (out of use since 1992). One signal box was for the operation of the former level crossing gates across Heidelberg Road, which was replaced by a road overpass in 1957. The other signal box controlled the level crossing gates at Ramsden Street.

Clifton Hill was once part of the Inner Circle line. The Hurstbridge line, between Clifton Hill and Westgarth, was duplicated during late 2008 and early 2009, and included a second bridge over the Merri Creek. On 27 January 2009, it was opened by former premier, John Brumby, and former transport minister, Lynne Kosky.

In the early hours of 25 December 2011, a corrugated iron extension to the Platform 2 station building was damaged by fire. By 12 January 2012, the extension was demolished and removed.

== Platforms and services ==
Clifton Hill has two side platforms, connected by an underpass. Platform 1 contains an enclosed waiting area, while Platform 2 contains a semi-enclosed waiting area and toilets.

The station is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda and Hurstbridge line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda

<text>Westgarth railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Northcote, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Westgarth station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 May 1888.

Initially opened as Westgarth Street, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Northcote South on 1 August 1888 and then given its current name of Westgarth on 10 December 1906.

==History==
Westgarth station opened on 8 May 1888 as Westgarth Street, along the newly opened railway line between Collingwood and Heidelberg. Westgarth station, like the locality itself, was named after William Westgarth, a merchant, historian and a member of both the New South Wales Legislative Council and the Victorian Legislative Council. Shortly after, on 1 August 1888 the station&#x27;s name was changed to Northcote South.

On 10 December 1906, the station was renamed from Northcote South to its current name, Westgarth. This was done to prevent confusion as there were several train stations in Northcote named after the suburb at the time.

In late 1912, whilst the line was being duplicated between Westgarth and Alphington. Westgarth was relocated from the up end to the down end; directly north of Westgarth Street where it remains today. The current weatherboard station buildings were also built at this time. 

In 1913, complaints arose regarding the substandard facilities and the lack of staff and pedestrian crossing at the newly constructed station. Described as &quot;an island in a sea of mud&quot; commuters were said to &quot;&quot;climb the fence and walked along the railway reserve, to save a walk a quarter of a mile.&quot;&quot; This prompted a timber footbridge to be constructed, which remains in the same place today.

In 1968, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Westgarth Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station. The signal box for the level crossing was also abolished at that time.

During late 2008 and early 2009, 750 meters of single track between Westgarth and Clifton Hill was duplicated. This included a second bridge over the Merri Creek running parallel to the original 1888 rail bridge. On 27 January 2009, the duplicated track and bridge opened.

==Platforms and services==
Westgarth has two side platforms. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

<doc id="708544" wikidata="Q2826086" url="?curid=708544" title="Affirming a disjunct">
<text>The formal fallacy of affirming a disjunct also known as the fallacy of the alternative disjunct or a false exclusionary disjunct occurs when a deductive argument takes the following logical form:

:A or B
:A 
:Therefore, not B

Or in logical operators:

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3 ¬ formula_4 

Where formula_3 denotes a logical assertion.

==Explanation==
The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true because &quot;or&quot; is defined inclusively rather than exclusively. It is a fallacy of equivocation between the operations OR and XOR.

Affirming the disjunct should not be confused with the valid argument known as the disjunctive syllogism.

==Examples==

The following argument indicates the unsoundness of affirming a disjunct:

:Max is a mammal or Max is a cat.
:Max is a mammal.
:Therefore, Max is not a cat.

This inference is unsound because all cats, by definition, are mammals.

A second example provides a first proposition that appears realistic and shows how an obviously flawed conclusion still arises under this fallacy.

:To be on the cover of Vogue Magazine, one must be a celebrity or very beautiful.
:This month&#x27;s cover was a celebrity.
:Therefore, this celebrity is not very beautiful.

<text>Maurice Thorez (; 28 April 1900 – 11 July 1964) was a French politician and longtime leader of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1930 until his death. He also served as Deputy Prime Minister of France from 1946 to 1947.

== Pre-War ==
Thorez, born in Noyelles-Godault, Pas-de-Calais, became a coal miner at the age of 12. He joined the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) in 1919 and was imprisoned several times for his political activism. After the 1920 split in the SFIO led to the formation of the French Communist Party (PCF) in December 1920, Thorez became party secretary in 1923 and, in 1930, general secretary of the party, a position he held until his death. After he took office as secretary general, he was supported by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In 1932 Thorez became the companion of Jeannette Vermeersch; they had three sons before marrying in 1947, and remained married until his death.
Thorez was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1932 and reelected in 1936. In 1934, following a Comintern directive, he helped form the Popular Front, an alliance between Communists, Socialists, and radical Socialists. The Front, because of strong popular support as France was reeling from the impact of the Great Depression, won the 1936 election. With the support of the Communists under Thorez, the socialist Léon Blum became Prime Minister of a Popular Front government and managed to enact much of the Front&#x27;s social-legislation programme. Meanwhile, Thorez presided over massive growth of the Communist Party, beginning with the elections of 1936.

== World War II ==
Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 and the subsequent Soviet participation in the invasion of Poland, the Communist Party was against the French war effort and so was outlawed: the Communist Party did not support what the Nazis stood for but points of similarity were stressed. The Party supported the Soviet Union&#x27;s tactical treaty with Germany in order to direct German aggression away from the USSR and toward the United Kingdom and France. For impeding the fight against the Nazis, the Party&#x27;s publications were banned and many Party members were interned. Thorez himself had his passport revoked. Shortly thereafter, he was drafted.

Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the French Communist Party openly declared it would violently resist the German occupation; even before this, the Communist Party organized a demonstration of thousands of students and workers against the occupation on 11 November 1940, and in May 1941 organized a strike of 100,000 miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments. During this time, articles written by and ghostwritten for Thorez appeared frequently in the party&#x27;s underground newspaper, &quot;Humanité Clandestine&quot;. Each of these letters was signed &#x27;Maurice Thorez, somewhere in France&#x27;. It was not until several years after the war that the party admitted that this was false, and that Thorez had been in Moscow for the entire war. In his absence, the affairs of the PCF and of the &quot;Francs-Tireurs et Partisans&quot;, the party&#x27;s resistance movement, in France were organised by his second in command, Jacques Duclos.

When General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces liberated France in 1944, Thorez received a pardon. After the Liberation, Thorez was ordered by Stalin to lead the PCF immediately after the Second World War to a non-revolutionary road to power. The instructions were not to seize power as had been done elsewhere, but have the reluctant wartime Communist partisans surrender their weapons, and the party would become a powerful force in the post-war governments since it thought that it would soon win legally.

==Post-war==
In November 1944, Thorez returned to France from his exile in the Soviet Union, and in 1945 his citizenship was restored. The PCF emerged from the Second World War as the largest political party in France based on its role in the anti-Nazi resistance movement during the occupation of France, at least after 1941. Thorez was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies and reelected throughout the Fourth Republic (1946–1958).

=== In power ===

Forming a popular front with the Socialist Party in the 1945 elections, Thorez became vice premier of France from 1946 to 1947. 

By 1947 a combination of the emerging Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union and growing social conflicts in France, linked to the increasing gap between wages and prices, put the three party union (SFIO, PCF and MRP) under heavy pressure, culminating in the May 1947 crisis. Prime Minister Paul Ramadier received threats from the United States that the presence of Communist ministers in the government would have consequences, such as the blocking of U.S. aid from the coming Marshall Plan, or worse: &quot;I told Ramadier,&quot; Jefferson Caffery, then U.S. ambassador to France, wrote in his diary, &quot;no Communists in gov. or else.&quot;

Simultaneously, the 1947 strikes in France caused rumours to spread among the non-Communist members of the government that the PCF would attempt a coup d&#x27;état on 1 May: Jules Moch, SFIO Public Works Minister, claimed to have &quot;certain information&quot; on preparations of a coup by the PCF. Ramadier is alleged to have worked secretly with Georges Revers, the Army Chief of Staff, to set up a secret transport and communications network within the military to safeguard against such a coup, all without the knowledge of François Billoux, the Communist Minister of Defence. The crisis was also escalated by the beginnings of the colonial war in Vietnam, with the communist deputies in the National Assembly voting against the war. 

Combined, that led Ramadier to look for a pretext to dismiss Thorez and his colleagues from the ruling coalition. On 4 May, the PCF ministers voted against the government over deflationary policies such as wage and price controls, which was given as the reason for the PCF ministers being forced out of the ruling coalition on 7 May 1947. Thorez later recalled the May 1947 events:

===In opposition ===
In 1950, at the height of his popularity among party members, Thorez suffered a stroke and remained in the Soviet Union for medical care until 1953. That March, Stalin died and Thorez was a member of the French delegation to Stalin&#x27;s funeral. During the absence of Thorez, the party was &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by Jacques Duclos. Thorez resumed his duties upon returning to France. Although his health had deteriorated, Thorez remained party leader until shortly before his death in 1964 on a Black Sea cruise.

He published in 1937 an autobiography, &quot;Fils du peuple&quot; (&quot;Son of the People&quot;, 1938). The book had been written with the help of :fr:Jean Fréville, who had inserted in the story a passage where the initials of the words formed the phrase &quot;Fréville a écrit ce livre&quot; (&quot;Fréville wrote this book&quot;). The passage, present on pages 36-37 of the first edition, was deleted in the following editions. 

In 1945, he published &quot;Une politique de grandeur française&quot; (1945; &quot;Politics of French Greatness&quot;).

A French research institution linked to the French Communist Party and set up in the mid-1960s was named the Institut Maurice Thorez. The city of Torez in Ukraine was named after him in 1964. In 2016, the city was given back the former name of Chystyakove by decision of the Ukrainian Parliament. The Moscow State Linguistic University was named the &quot;Maurice Thorez Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages&quot; (Russian: Московский институт иностранных языков имени Мориса Тореза) between 1964 and 1990.

<text>Fairfield railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network, and serves the north-eastern suburb of the same name in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Fairfield is a ground level host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 May 1888. Originally called Fairfield Park, the station was re-named Fairfield on 14 November 1943.

Fairfield Industrial Dog Object (FIDO), a 6-metre-tall wooden sculpture of a dog, is located adjacent to the level crossing, at the eastern end of Platform 2.

==History==
The station opened along with the railway between Collingwood and Heidelberg. Like the suburb itself, it was named after &quot;Fairfield Park&quot;, an estate that was subdivided on land owned by land speculator Charles Henry James. The estate is believed to have been named after Fairfield in Derbyshire, England. James built Melbourne&#x27;s first tram line in 1884, a horse-drawn tram from the station northwards to the Fairfield Park Estate. The tramway had closed by 1890.

From 1891 to 1893, Fairfield was the junction for the northern end of the former Outer Circle line, and was later the junction for the APM Siding, which operated from 1919 to the 1990s and served the nearby Australian Paper Manufacturers paper mill.

The station was upgraded in the early 1910s with new timber station buildings constructed in 1911. That included replacing the former at-grade pedestrian crossing at Rathmines Street with a pedestrian footbridge, opened in March 1914.

In 1969, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Station Street level crossing, at the down end of the station. In 1988, the goods siding at the station was abolished.

In 1999, the station building on Platform 1 underwent restoration.

==Platforms and services==

Fairfield has two side platforms, and is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

<text>Heidelberg railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Heidelberg, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Heidelberg station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 8 May 1888.

==History==
When Heidelberg station opened, it was the terminus of what is now the Hurstbridge line. On 1 September 1913, the current island station officially opened.

At one time, there was a goods yard opposite Platform 1. It made way for an extension of the passenger car park, although the goods shed still exists. At one time, there were three tracks running through the station. Two served the island platform, and the third track was the last surviving stabling track. The third track was removed after a period of disuse.

Between 26 January 1942 and 6 February 1942, fourteen trains were modified to become ambulance trains, which carried returning wounded World War II servicemen from Melbourne to Heidelberg, where ambulances were waiting to take them to the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. On 3 November 1995, 50 years after the end of that conflict, Vin Heffernan, the member for Ivanhoe, unveiled a plaque at the station to commemorate the role of the station in the war effort.

During 1988, the former No. 4 and No. 5 tracks were abolished, along with a number of disc signal posts.

In 1992, the station received an enclosed waiting area and ticket facilities, as part of the &quot;Travel Safe&quot; program of the early 1990s. On 5 March 1994, after the signals had been upgraded to an electronic system, one of the decommissioned mechanical semaphore signals (&quot;Signal No. 4&quot;) was relocated from the Melbourne side of the station to the car-park opposite Platform 1, for display purposes. Signal No. 4 had first been erected at Heidelberg in 1912. On 21 June 1996, Heidelberg was upgraded to a premium station.

At the 2016-17 Victorian State Budget, $140.2 million was allocated to duplicate the single-track between Heidelberg and Rosanna, which included a second rail tunnel alongside the existing one. That project was completed on 30 April 2018.

==Platforms and services==
Heidelberg has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

<text>Thou Shalt Suffer were a band that was part of the early Norwegian black metal scene. It formed in 1990 at Akkerhaugen, Norway, under the name &quot;Dark Device&quot;. Its style was mainly death metal, though it included some black metal traits, alongside Ihsahn&#x27;s trademark keyboard melodies. The band split up in late 1991 when its members formed Emperor and Ildjarn.

In 2000, Ihsahn used the name Thou Shalt Suffer for his solo project. That year he released &quot;Somnium&quot;, an album of ambient songs influenced by medieval music.

==History==
Thou Shalt Suffer began in 1990 when vocalist Ihsahn met guitarist Samoth at a clinic for rock musicians. The two started playing together under various names, such as Dark Device, Xerasia, and Embryonic. They eventually settled on Thou Shalt Suffer. It was during this time Ihsahn began to develop his skills as a keyboard player, and his trademark sound can be heard on the band&#x27;s recordings. In 1991, the band recorded two demos, &quot;Into the Woods of Belial&quot; and &quot;Open the Mysteries of Your Creation&quot;. Both recordings exhibited a distinct style which would eventually develop into the classic &quot;Emperor sound&quot; of Ihsahn&#x27;s and Samoth&#x27;s later careers. Most of the band&#x27;s early material was recorded on Ildjarn&#x27;s 4-track recording device (which he later used to record his solo albums) and featured very raw and dirty production.

When Samoth began writing music outside of the band, Thou Shalt Suffer began to dissolve. Bassist Ildjarn and drummer Thorbjørn Akkerhaugen both left the band. Ildjarn formed his own eponymous project Ildjarn (which was often contributed to by both Ihsahn and Samoth), while Akkerhaugen went on to found Akkerhaugen Studios. At this point (late 1991), Emperor had come into full swing, and Thou Shalt Suffer was put on hold. Ihsahn did not completely abandon the band, however – instead, he used the name to release dark neo-romantic orchestral music. The first Thou Shalt Suffer full-length album was released in 2000, titled &quot;Somnium&quot;. It was composed and produced entirely by Ihsahn. The band&#x27;s original two demos were pressed to CD and released to the public. This compilation, simply titled &quot;Into the Woods of Belial&quot;, was re-released and widely distributed in 2004.

For the time being, Thou Shalt Suffer seems to be on hold once again, as Ihsahn is focusing primarily on his solo career because his previous project, Peccatum, has been terminated.

<text>Rosanna railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Rosanna, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Rosanna station is an elevated unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 October 1927, with the current station provided in 2018.

==History==
Rosanna station, like the suburb itself, was named after Elizabeth Anna Rose, the wife of James Watson, who purchased land in the area in 1838 when the then Warringal village was divided in nine portions of varying sizes. Watson later named his land &quot;Rosa Anna Farm&quot;.

In 1958, in conjunction with the duplication of the line between Rosanna Junction (which was at the up end of the station) and Macleod, flashing light signals replaced wigwags at the former Lower Plenty Road level crossing, which was at the down end of the station. In 1972, boom barriers were provided. Three years later, in 1975, new station buildings were provided.

On 6 October 2017, the former ground-level station closed, as part of the removal of the Lower Plenty Road level crossing and the duplication of the Hurstbridge line between Rosanna and Heidelberg. On 4 May 2018, the new elevated station opened.

==Platforms and services==
Rosanna has two side platforms. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Macleod, Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

<text>Macleod railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Macleod, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Macleod station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 March 1911, with the current station provided in 1979.

==History==

Macleod station was completed by November 1910, and was opened to traffic on 1 March 1911.

The station is named after Malcolm Anderson Macleod, a prominent local resident, whose wife Edith Jessie Macleod purchased land in the area. The press of the time credited Edith Macleod&#x27;s husband with owning the land but this was not the case. A thin strip of Macleod&#x27;s land measuring 31.51 hectares was sold to the State Government to enable the construction of a branch line for the Mont Park Psychiatric Hospital. The timing and methods by which the strip of land was acquired for the railway line was likely corrupt. The land transfer was examined as part of the 1909 &quot;Royal Commission on the Acquisition of Certain Estates by Sir Thomas Bent&quot; which found that the Crown had paid too much for it.

After the land acquisition, engineers discovered that the acquired land was too steep to accommodate the proposed railway line, so a land swap had to be arranged between Edith Macleod and the Crown for some of her remaining land holdings nearby. The land swap was enabled by the &quot;Mont Park Land Act 1910&quot; (Vic.), which finally enabled the construction of the freight-only Mont Park branch line from Macleod station to the asylum in a north-westerly direction. From 1911 to 1964, Macleod was the junction of the Mont Park branch line.

Newspaper articles from the time claim that Malcolm Macleod conceived of the idea of the railway station at Macleod by stipulating that it had to be built at that location and under his name in return for the land transfer, however a reservation for the railway station had been in place since the Board of Land and Works had acquired land for a railway line in 1894 and it has been demonstrated that the railway station was not his idea. The original proposal was to name the station &quot;Mont Park&quot;.

In 1979, the present day Platform 3 was provided on an alignment near the former branch line alignment, as were three stabling sidings immediately to the south of the station, both coinciding with the duplication of the railway line between Macleod and Greensborough. A number of train services terminate at Macleod, before proceeding to the sidings to stable.

In 2001, Macleod was upgraded to a premium station.

On 25 October 2022, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Ruthven Street level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station, will be grade separated by 2027, with the railway line to be rebuilt over the road.

==Facilities, platforms and services==

Macleod has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. Platform 1 has an enclosed waiting area, ticket facilities and toilets.

It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Hurstbridge line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Greensborough, Eltham and Hurstbridge

Platform 3:
* terminating services to and from Flinders Street

<text>Watsonia railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Watsonia, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Watsonia station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 23 June 1924, with the current station provided in 1977.

==History==
Watsonia station was provisionally known as Collina during construction. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after Frank Watson, a local landowner who subdivided his property, &quot;Grace Park&quot;, into the &quot;Grace Park Station Estate&quot;.

The current station dates back to 1977, when that section of the railway line was lowered to remove a number of level crossings. In 1979, the line between Macleod and Greensborough stations was duplicated.

During 1988-1989, the present Greensborough Highway overpass, located nearby in the down direction from the station, was provided.

In December 2007, Watsonia was upgraded to a premium station.

==Facilities, platforms and services==
Watsonia is located in a deep cutting, between the Greensborough Highway and Watsonia Road. It has one island platform with two faces, with access to the platforms provided by a pedestrian overpass and a ramp. The station features a customer service window, a coffee shop, an enclosed waiting room, and toilets.

It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

<text>Greensborough railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Greensborough, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Greensborough station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 5 June 1902, with the current station provided in 2023.

Because of the curvature of the line, north-bound (Hurstbridge) services head south-east upon departing the station and, likewise, south-bound (Flinders Street) services head north-west. A number of peak-hour services to and from Flinders Street terminate at Greensborough.

==History==
Greensborough station was a single-track, single platform station built in 1902, for service to (at the time) the outer north eastern suburb of Greensborough. At the time of construction, it was serviced by steam engines inbound and outbound from the Melbourne CBD, until the completion of the electrification from Heidelberg to Eltham in 1923.

The original platform was located on the south-western side of the station, where the current car-parking is located. The original track ran through the current island platform.

Due to the restrictions of only having one track out to Hurstbridge and only one through track, the trains were timetabled to arrive 3–4 minutes apart. The Hurstbridge service would collect passengers from the platform, then shunt out to a junction at the up end of the station, pull into a side track and wait 1–2 minutes for the Flinders Street service to arrive then depart, then continuing to Hurstbridge. Due to a much higher passenger count going to the city at the time, the Flinders Street service was given priority over the low passenger count toward Hurstbridge.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the station was upgraded to two tracks, and a single offset island platform was built. The station had a platform on the left and right, one for each direction. In 1969, the rebuilt station was provided and, on 3 April 1970, it officially opened. In 1977, a goods yard that existed at the station was closed to traffic. In 1979, the railway line between Greensborough and Macleod was duplicated.

On 21 June 1996, Greensborough was upgraded to a premium station.

In May 2019, the Victorian State Government announced a plan to duplicate the line between Greensborough and Eltham, which included an upgrading of the station. The upgrade involved the building of an overpass and concourse, rebuilt station platforms and better accessibility in and around the station precinct. On 9 February 2021, final designs of the new station were released, and in mid-2021, early works on the project commenced. In 2022, the old station closed and was demolished to allow for major construction on the project, and the rebuilt station officially opened on 30 April 2023.

Until 2023, the timetabling for services to and from the station remained practically the same, due to the single-track railway between Greensborough and Hurstbridge, with only crossing loops located at Eltham and Diamond Creek. An Eltham/Hurstbridge service arrived approximately one minute before the Flinders Street service arrived, with both services departing at same time, allowing the outbound service clear passage to Eltham.

==Platforms and services==

Greensborough has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Hurstbridge line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Eltham and Hurstbridge

<text>Montmorency railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Montmorency, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Montmorency station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 5 September 1923, with the current station provided in 2023.

==History==
Montmorency station opened twenty-one years after the railway line from Heidelberg was extended to Hurstbridge. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a local farm, the &quot;Montmorency Estate&quot;, itself named after the French town Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise.

In the lead-up to the 2018 state election, the opposition Liberal Party promised A$300m to duplicate the line between Greensborough and Eltham, and provide Montmorency with a second platform.

On 15 May 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that planning for the duplication of 3 kms of track between Greensborough and Eltham was underway. Final designs of the new station were released on 9 February 2021, with early work of the project commencing in late 2021, with major construction started in 2022. The station was rebuilt approximately west of the current station, and included a new platform. On 30 April 2023, the rebuilt station opened.

==Platforms, facilities and services==
Montmorency has two side platforms. It is located between Were Street and Mayona Road, with station access from both. There are sheltered waiting areas on both platforms, two myki top up machines, six myki touch on/off stands and a &quot;pod&quot; for Protective Services Officers.

The station is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

<text>Eltham railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Eltham, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Eltham station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 5 June 1902, with the current platforms provided in 1960 and the upgrades in 2013.

Eltham is the terminus for a number of peak and off-peak services on the line. Five stabling sidings are located to the west of Platform 2, with the site previously having been a goods yard. The last timber trestle bridge on the Melbourne suburban network is located to the south of the station.

==History==
Eltham station opened on 5 June 1902, when the railway line from Heidelberg was extended. It remained a terminus until June 1912, when the line was extended to Hurstbridge. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after the district of Eltham in Kent, England.

In 1960, Platform 1 was converted from a south-facing bay platform to a through platform, with a connection to the main line provided at the down end of the station. Also in that year, the current station building was provided. In 1969, flashing light signals were provided at the Diamond Street level crossing, located nearby in the down direction from the station.

In 1977, a ramped goods platform was abolished, with a goods shed believed to be demolished around the same time. By 1984, goods traffic to and from the station ceased. In 1987, boom barriers were provided at the Diamond Street level crossing.

On 4 July 1996, Eltham was upgraded to a premium station. A minor refurbishment of the station also occurred during this time.

On 25 December 2011, following a large storm and subsequent flooding, parts of the line at the down end of the level crossing were washed away. The flooding also eroded a culvert, exposing a small timber bridge.

Eltham was one of the last stations in Melbourne to be controlled by mechanical safeworking, including the use of semaphore signals. It was also a break between two different types of safeworking: Greensborough to Eltham was controlled by miniature electric staff, whilst Eltham to Hurstbridge was controlled by train staff and ticket. Both safeworking systems were converted to Automatic Track Control (ATC) in early 2013. A new amenities building for train drivers was constructed around that time, as well as an upgrade to the stabling sidings.

On 15 May 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that planning for the duplication of 3 kms of track between Eltham and Greensborough was underway, with early works began in 2021, with major construction started in 2022. The Eltham Trestle Bridge would not be affected by the project. The project was completed in 2023.

==Platforms and services==
Eltham has one island platform with two faces. Trains in either direction can depart from either platform, although Hurstbridge bound services almost always depart from Platform 1, and Flinders Street bound services usually depart from Platform 2.

It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Hurstbridge

<text>Diamond Creek railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Diamond Creek, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Diamond Creek station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 25 June 1912, with the current station provided in 2023.

==History==
Diamond Creek station opened on 25 June 1912, when the railway line from Eltham was extended to Hurstbridge. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the nearby Diamond Creek, which was given that name as it was believed that the water at the bottom of the creek bed was bright, due to the crystalline minerals of various shapes.

In 1957, the station was closed to goods traffic and, in 1959, flashing light signals were provided at the Hurstbridge Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station.

In 1979, the station building on Platform 1 was damaged by fire. In 1988, boom barriers were provided at the Hurstbridge Road level crossing.

On 22 March 1991, just after 19:00, a Hurstbridge-bound train collided with a stationary Flinders Street-bound train at the station, resulting in three people injured and three carriages derailing. Parts of the platform were also damaged in the collision.

A passing loop had been provided at the station for many years, believed to have been originally used as a goods siding. On 7 June 1994, a second platform was constructed on the passing loop. Before that, one train had to set back after using the platform, then enter the loop to allow another train to pass. Both platforms are bi-directional, however, with the introduction of electronic signalling in 2008, Platform 2 could only be used by Hurstbridge-bound trains. In 2013, Platform 2 received a signal pointing city-bound, allowing both platforms to become bi-directional again.

Diamond Creek was one of the last stations in Melbourne controlled by the staff and ticket safeworking system, including the use of semaphore signals. The station was a break between two sections of the safeworking system: Eltham to Diamond Creek, and Diamond Creek to Hurstbridge. As a result, Metro Trains&#x27; staff were required to operate the safeworking system, including operating the points for the crossing loop. In 2008, the signals and the points were upgraded to be controlled electronically and, in early 2013, the safe working system was converted to Automatic &amp; Track Control (ATC).

On 15 May 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that planning for the duplication of of track between Diamond Creek and Wattle Glen was underway, with construction commencing in early 2022. As part of the duplication works, Platform 2 also received an upgrade. Works were completed in 2023.

On 30 April 2023, the rebuilt Platform 2 opened and was rebuilt to meet modern safety and accessibility standards. The rebuilt Platform 2 included installation of new platform shelters, resurfacing the platform from white concrete to asphalt, new platform and entrance signages, a new access ramp with a new upgraded pedestrian crossing gates which were upgraded from occupational pedestrian crossing to swing gates pedestrian crossings. The pedestrian crossing is located southbound of the station. Platform 1 largely stayed the same, the only thing changed was the new platform signages installed.

Prior to the duplication north of the station in 2023, both platforms were bi-directional. After the duplication was completed, citybound trains must depart from the upgraded platform 2 (which was built in 1994) while Hurstbridge-bound trains must depart from the larger original platform 1. This platform numbering arrangement is uncommon across stations with two platforms with citybound trains typically using platform 1 and outbound typically using platform 2.

==Platforms and services==
Diamond Creek has two side platforms. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Hurstbridge

<text>Wattle Glen railway station is a commuter railway station on the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Wattle Glen, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Wattle Glen station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 25 June 1912.

Initially opened as Balee, it was changed to Wattleglen (one word) on 14 August 1922. However, currently the station is signed and commonly known as Wattle Glen (two words).

==History==
Wattle Glen station opened on 25 June 1912, when the railway line from Eltham was extended to Hurstbridge. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after the wattle trees that are in abundance throughout the area.

In 1968, flashing light signals were provided at the Wilson Road level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station. In 1979, the former station building was destroyed by fire. In 1987, boom barriers were provided at the Wilson Road level crossing.

In late 2007, an upgrade to the station and its car park took place, and included installing fencing and sealing the car park.

In 2018, it was announced that the Level Crossing Removal Project would undergo a second upgrade on the Hurstbridge line, which involved duplicating the track between Wattle Glen and Diamond Creek. However, no upgrades were proposed for the station itself or the nearby Wilson Road level crossing, with the duplication ending south of the level crossing. The duplication was completed in 2023.

During the 2018/2019 financial year, Wattle Glen was the least-patronised station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with approximately 48,000 passenger movements annually.

In 2020, it was announced that the station car park will be upgraded with 50 new spots, improved CCTV and lighting, as well as more bicycle parking facilities.

Although the railway station signage and the operator&#x27;s public timetables render the name of the station as two words, some internal sources, such as VicNames, and the internal network map, renders the official spelling of the station as Wattleglen, one word. However, the operator&#x27;s internal signalling diagram uses the two word form. It is unclear why the Post Office and suburb were made two words when the Post Office was renamed from Diamond Creek Upper on 1 November 1922, particularly after the station had been renamed (as one word) two and a half months earlier.

==Platforms and services==
Wattle Glen has one platform. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations services to Hurstbridge

<text>Hurstbridge railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Hurstbridge line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Hurstbridge, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Hurstbridge station is a ground level host station, featuring a single platform. It opened on 25 June 1912.

Initially opened as Hurst&#x27;s Bridge, the station was given its current name of Hurstbridge on 9 December 1912.

==History==
Hurstbridge station opened on 25 June 1912, when the railway line was extended from Eltham. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a local settler, Henry Hurst, who built a log bridge across the Diamond Creek to access a property named &quot;Allwood&quot;.

In 1957, a goods train service between Eltham and Hurstbridge was withdrawn. In 1962, a siding that operated to a cool store was abolished.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 16 February 1973, Tait trailer carriage 202T was destroyed by a fire while stabled in No. 1 road.

On 9 April 1983, Comeng motor carriage 315M and Tait motor carriage 472M were destroyed by a fire whilst at the station. Both cars were later scrapped.

Shortly before 2:00 a.m. on 11 November 2015, X&#x27;Trapolis train set 927M-1664T-928M derailed, following an unauthorised movement from the yard, resulting in collisions with various items of infrastructure and another train. On 1 June 2016, a former Metro Trains&#x27; worker pleaded guilty to causing the incident, along with lighting two fires at Newport Workshops in 2015, which damaged or destroyed heritage train carriages, including a historical Swing Door EMU.

==Platforms and services==
Hurstbridge has one platform. It is served by Hurstbridge line trains.

<text>Rushall railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Fitzroy North, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Rushall station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 January 1927.

==History==

Named after a nearby street, itself possibly named after a housing development in 1869, Rushall was also a station on the former Inner Circle line, which operated between Clifton Hill and Royal Park until July 1948.

Rushall is located next to the Merri Creek, and is connected to Westgarth by a narrow, 80-metre-long footbridge for pedestrians and cyclists, crossing the Merri Creek as part of the Merri Creek Trail.

===Incidents===
On 6 February 2016, whilst operating a Flinders Street service, and negotiating the tightest curve on the metropolitan railway system, a trailer carriage of an X&#x27;Trapolis train derailed 100m north of the station, resulting in one injury. The line reopened the next day.

On 10 February 2016, another derailment, involving railway track machines, occurred near Rushall. That derailment resulted in buses replacing trains between Clifton Hill and Bell for much of 11 February. The line partially reopened for evening peak-hour commuters later that day.

===In music===
Melbourne indie band Underground Lovers wrote a song named &quot;Rushall Station&quot;, about the quietness of the site, which then became the title track for an album. The station is also mentioned in Marcel Borrack&#x27;s song &quot;Regent to Rushall&quot;.

In October 2016, Melbourne electronic music producer Arcadic released a single named after the station, titled &quot;Rushall&quot;. The artwork depicted Merri Creek, taken from the window of a train departing Rushall station.

==Platforms and services==

Rushall has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda

==Transport links==

Kinetic Melbourne operates two bus routes via Rushall station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Queen Street (Melbourne CBD) – La Trobe University Bundoora campus

<text>Merri railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Northcote, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Merri station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 1910.

Initially opened as Northcote, the station was given its current name of Merri on 10 December 1906.

== History ==

Merri station opened on 8 October 1889, when the Inner Circle line was extended from North Fitzroy to Reservoir. The original conception of the station was to act as a major junction in a planned &quot;&quot;North Suburban Railway System&quot;. &quot;The Argus&quot; reported in 1887 that; &quot;The Station at Union-street, as shown on our plan, must necessarily be the most important in the Northern System, as lines branch from this point to Preston and Whittlesea on the north ; Heidelberg, Kew, &amp;.c., on the east; Carlton, Royal-park, North Melbourne, and Spencer-street on the south-west; Fitzroy, East Melbourne, and Flinders-street on the south; and if the alternative route is adopted, Clifton-hill, Collingwood, Richmond, and Flinders street on the south east.&quot;, while land sale plans advertised the upcoming construction of the &quot;Grand Central Junction Station&quot;&quot;.

In 1910, the station building was rebuilt to accommodate an increased population in the area.

The nearby level crossing at Charles Street had hand-operated gates until 1924, when they were replaced with interlocked gates, operated from the nearby signal box, following several serious traffic accidents. In 1986, these gates were replaced with boom barriers. In 1987, the signal box was abolished.

In 1973, both platforms were extended at the down end of the station.

During October 1987, the double line block system between Merri – Northcote was abolished, and replaced with three position signalling, with all two position signals between Merri – Thornbury also abolished.

Announced as part of a $21.9 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Merri, alongside other stations, will receive accessibility upgrades, the installation of CCTV, and platform shelters. The development process will begin in late 2022 or early 2023, with a timeline for the upgrades to be released once construction has begun.

==Platforms and services==
Merri has two side platforms. It is served by Mernda line trains.

Platform 1:

Platform 2:

<text>Northcote railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Northcote, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Northcote station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 October 1889.

Initially opened as Middle Northcote, the station was given its current name of Northcote on 10 December 1906.

==History==
Northcote station opened on 8 October 1889, when the Inner Circle line was extended from North Fitzroy to Reservoir. Like the suburb itself, the station is believed to be named after Stafford Henry Northcote, who was British Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1874 and 1880, Foreign Secretary between 1885 and 1886, and a co-author of the Northcote–Trevelyan Report in 1853.

In 1973, both platforms were extended at the down end of the station.

In 1986, the former goods sidings, located at the down end of the station, were abolished. A crossover, also located at the down end, was spiked out of use around that time, and was removed at a later date.

During October 1987, the double line block system between Northcote – Merri and Northcote – Thornbury was abolished, and replaced with three position signalling. Also occurring in that year, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Arthurton Road level crossing, located at the down end of the station. The signal box for the level crossing was also abolished during that time.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Northcote to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

==Platforms and services==

Northcote has two side platforms. It is served by Mernda line trains.

Platform 1:

Platform 2:

<doc id="708581" wikidata="Q5464159" url="?curid=708581" title="Foil bearing">
<text>A foil bearing, also known as a foil-air bearing, is a type of air bearing. A shaft is supported by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that no contact occurs. The shaft and foil are separated by the air&#x27;s high pressure, which is generated by the rotation that pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. The high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic bearings, foil bearings require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.

==Development==

Foil bearings were first developed in the late 1950s by AiResearch Mfg. Co. of the Garrett Corporation using independent R&amp;D funds to serve military and space applications. They were first tested for commercial use in United Airlines Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 cooling turbines in the early and mid-1960s. Garrett AiResearch air cycle machine foil bearings were first installed as original equipment in 1969 in the DC-10&#x27;s environmental control systems. Garrett AiResearch foil bearings were installed on all US military aircraft to replace existing oil-lubricated rolling-contact bearings. The ability to operate at cryogenic gas temperatures and at very high temperatures gave foil bearings many other potential applications.

Current-generation foil bearings with advanced coatings have greatly exceeded the limitations of earlier designs. Antiwear coatings exist that allow over 100,000 start/stop cycles for typical applications.

==Applications==
Turbomachinery is the most common application because foil bearings operate at high speed. 
Commercial applications in production include microturbines, fuel cell blowers, and air cycle machines. The main advantage of foil bearings is the elimination of the oil systems required by traditional bearing designs. Other advantages are:
* Higher efficiency, due to a lower heat loss to friction; instead of fluid friction, the main source of heat is parasitic drag
* Increased reliability
* Higher speed capability
* Quieter operation
* Wider operating temperature range (40–2,500 K)
* High vibration and shock load capacity
* No scheduled maintenance
* No external support system
* Truly oil free where contamination is an issue
* Capable of operating above critical speed

Areas of current research are:
* Higher load capacity
* Improved damping 
* Improved coatings

The main disadvantages are:
* Lower capacity than roller or oil bearings
* Wear during start-up and stopping
* High speed required for operation

<text>Thornbury railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Thornbury, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Thornbury station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 October 1889.

== History ==
Thornbury station opened on 8 October 1889, when the Inner Circle line was extended from North Fitzroy to Reservoir, Thornbury station, like the suburb itself, is named after the &quot;Thornbury Park Estate&quot;, named after a farm owned by settler Job Smith. Smith named the farm after his birthplace in England.

In 1973, both platforms were extended at the down end of the station.

During October 1987, the double line block system between Thornbury and Northcote was abolished, and replaced with three-position signalling, with all two position signals between Thornbury and Merri also abolished. A number of signal posts were also abolished during this time.

In early 1988, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Hutton Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station.

Announced as part of a $21.9 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Thornbury, alongside other stations, will receive accessibility upgrades, the installation of CCTV, and platform shelters.

==Platforms and services==
Thornbury has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda

==Transport links==

Yarra Trams operates two routes via Thornbury station:
* : West Preston – Victoria Harbour (Docklands)
* : Bundoora RMIT – Waterfront City (Docklands)

The station opened on 8 October 1889, with the former ground level station closed and demolished in May 2022 and the current elevated station provided in September 2022 by the Level Crossing Removal Project. The station initially opened as &quot;Preston-Bell Street&quot; upon its opening in 1889, then it was given its current name of &quot;Bell&quot; on 1 August 1905.

Bell is an elevated premium station, consisting of two side platforms connected by staircases, lifts and a ground level concourse. The station fully complies with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and is accessible as there is a lift connecting to the ground level concourse and the station platforms on either side.

The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency and the station is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Bell station is currently served by the Mernda line, part of the Melbourne railway network. Additionally, the station is also served by four bus routes, it includes Dysons bus routes 513, 514, 552 and 553. The station is approximately or around a 22 minute train ride to Flinders Street.

== Description ==
Bell railway station is located in the north-eastern suburb of Preston in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency and the station is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is or around a 22 minute train ride to Flinders Street. The adjacent stations are Thornbury station up towards Flinders Street and Preston station down towards Mernda.

The station consists of two side platforms with two edges. As is standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The side platforms are approximately long, long enough for a 7 car High Capacity Metro Train. The station features a ground level concourse, accessible by stairs and lifts up to the elevated platforms. There is one main station building, opened in 2022, which contains a waiting room, a customer service, PSO office and a spacious ground level concourse inside the main station building. The station building is made out of local roofscapes abstracted into three-dimensional patterns and the primary colours are pink and purple colour glazing, post-war rooftops to the main station building and references to the local art and culture scene. The elevated platforms have shelters over seating to protect from Melbourne&#x27;s weather and has secure bike parking.

The station building, concourse and platform largely stayed the same since the station was rebuilt in 2022. There are 77 car and 28 protected bike parking at the station. The station is listed as fully accessible on the Metro Trains website, as there are lifts and accessible features available at the station.

== History ==
=== Pre level crossing removal ===
Bell station opened on 8 October 1889. The line through the station was originally built to extend the Inner Circle line from North Fitzroy station to a new terminus at Reservoir station. The station was named after the nearby Bell Street, a major road located on the north side of the station.

The station was situated next to the former Bell Street level crossing, which was upgraded with manually operated boom barriers in 1969, replacing the previous interlocking gates. A goods yard originally served the station, however, it was removed in 1986, leaving only a siding at the up end of the station. On 17 April 1988, the double-line block signalling system between Bell and Reservoir was decommissioned and was replaced with automatic three position signalling. Also in that month, pedestrian gates were provided at the former Bell Street level crossing, in combination with the manually operated road boom barriers.

On 25 August 2008, Bell station was upgraded to a premium station, featuring the addition of customer service facilities and the conversion of the former ground-level station building into a waiting room.

=== Level Crossing Removal Project ===

In 2014, the Andrews government announced a $2.4 billion program to remove and grade separate the Bell Street level crossing, along with 49 other level crossings in Melbourne, projected for completion by 2022. It was later formed under the Level Crossing Removal Project program in January 2016 and the time, the Bell Street level crossing had not been decided how the grade separation would be achieved.

On 30 November 2018, the Andrews government announced that the Level Crossing Removal Project would remove an additional level crossing at Oakover Road, along with 24 other level crossings in Melbourne as part of a $6.6 billion program. At the same time, the elevated railway option was chosen.

In February 2021, construction began on the project with piling works, install fencing around the construction site and foundation for temporary overhead wiring in preparation for the creation of the elevated railway bridge. During the major construction period, the Mernda line was closed for a few times at a maximum of 12 days in 2021 and 2022 to facilitate further piling and excavation works. Between 5 May to 12 May 2021, the original Bell station building was demolished to make way for the new elevated railway bridge and the Mernda line was closed for the period of that time to install temporary equipment at the station. Once the temporary station opened, major excavation works were able to begin. Construction of the first part of the U-through bridge section made up of two L-shaped beams for the elevated railway bridge installed and digging for the 114 piers also started to occur during this time.

Between 17 May to 30 May 2022, the Mernda line was shut down for 12 days to remove the Oakover Road and Bell Street level crossings, get the first part of the elevated railway bridge ready for trains to run on and demolish the old ground level station platforms. On 30 May 2022, the first part of the 2 kilometre bridge opened with only a single track temporarily until 26 August 2022 because they could not close the Mernda line for longer than 12 days due to the requirement of trains to regularly access the Epping maintenance yard facility.

On 5 September 2022, the rebuilt elevated Bell station opened to the public. The elevated station opened in a basic state, with lifts, paving and additional exits opened on the north side of the station. The rebuilt Bell station was moved 40 metres from the former ground level station site to increase the amount of community open space, forecourt and landscaping area. The station is water and energy efficient with sustainable features such as solar panels, rain water reuse, LED lighting and environmentally sustainable materials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In late October 2022, came to the completion of the car park located south of Bell station. Around the same time, the signalised pedestrian crossing was built at the location of the former Bell Street level crossing in preparation for the opening of the shared walking and bike path. In 2023, came to the completion of the open space. The open spaces were named &quot;Oakover Green&quot; near Oakover Road and the Bell station area located west of Bell station. The Oakover Green space has features a playground, landscaped gardens, seating areas and a yarning circle developed by Wurundjeri artists. The Bell station area features the station building&#x27;s abstract pitched roof, pink and purple colour glazing and an amphitheatre on the eastern side of the station.

== Platforms and services ==
Bell has two side platforms. The station is currently served by the Mernda line, part of the metropolitan railway network. The Mernda line runs from Mernda station, north-east of Melbourne, joining with the Hurstbridge line at Clifton Hill station before travelling through Flinders Street station and back through the City Loop in a clockwise direction.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda

== Transport links ==

== History ==
=== Original ground level station (1888-2022) ===

Preston station opened on 8 October 1889, when the Inner Circle line was extended from North Fitzroy to Reservoir, Preston station, like the suburb itself, was named after Preston in Sussex, England. The name was chosen by Edward Wood, who was originally from Sussex and, in 1850, opened a general store at the corner of the current day intersection of High and Wood Streets.

In 1967, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Cramer Street and Murray Road level crossings, which were located in the up and down directions respectively. In 1973, the former ground level station buildings were provided, replacing the original 1889 structures. In 1998, Preston was upgraded to a premium station.

=== Level Crossing Removal Project ===

On 30 November 2018, the Andrews government announced that the Level Crossing Removal Project would remove the Cramer Street and Murray Road level crossings, along with 23 other level crossings in Melbourne as part of a $6.6 billion program. At the same time, the elevated railway option was chosen.

In February 2021, construction began on the project with piling works, install fencing around the construction site and foundation for temporary overhead wiring in preparation for the creation of the elevated railway bridge. During the major construction period, the Mernda line was closed for a few times at a maximum of 12 days in 2021 and 2022 to facilitate further piling and excavation works. Between 5 May to 12 May 2021, the original Preston station building was demolished to make way for the new elevated railway bridge and the Mernda line was closed for the period of that time to install temporary equipment at the station. Once the temporary station opened, major excavation works were able to begin. Construction of the first part of the U-through bridge section made up of two L-shaped beams for the elevated railway bridge installed and digging for the 114 piers also started to occur during this time.

Between 17 May to 30 May 2022, the Mernda line was shut down for 12 days to remove the Cramer Street and Murray Road level crossings, get the first part of the elevated railway bridge ready for trains to run on and demolish the old ground level station platforms. On 30 May 2022, the first part of the 2 kilometre bridge opened with only a single track temporarily until 26 August 2022 because they could not close the Mernda line for longer than 12 days due to the requirement of trains to regularly access the Epping maintenance yard facility.

On 5 September 2022, the rebuilt station opened to the public. The elevated station opened in a basic state, with lifts, paving and additional exits opened on the north side of the station. The station is water and energy efficient with sustainable features such as solar panels, rain water reuse, LED lighting and environmentally sustainable materials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In late October 2022, came to the completion of the new additional car parks adjacent to north of Cramer Street and north of Murray Road. In 2023, came to the completion of the open spaces. The Bruce Street area features a playground, BBQ facilities, seating areas and all-ages fitness facilities. The Preston station area features an improved cycling and walking paths which opened in late 2022, expansive open space, newer and safer connections to popular local destinations and the station facades&#x27; bright colour which features a barcode that reflects on the vivid colours of the produce found at Preston Market. The north of Murray Road area is used as a multi use area. The north of Murray Road area features planting that includes native grasses and flowering varieties, landscaping that brings colour and enhances local biodiversity and seating and natural play elements with a parkour theme.

<text>Reservoir railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern suburb of Reservoir, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Reservoir is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 2019.

Initially opened as Preston-Reservoir, the station was given its current name of Reservoir on 1 December 1909.

==History==
Reservoir station opened when the Inner Circle line was extended from North Fitzroy station. On 23 December of the same year, the line was further extended to Epping. Like the suburb, the station was named after the three reservoirs that were built south-east of the station, in 1864, 1909 and 1913 respectively. The reservoirs were constructed to hold Melbourne&#x27;s water supply from the Yan Yean Reservoir.

The station was originally the terminus for suburban services on the Whittlesea line. The line was duplicated in December 1910 and, in July 1921, Reservoir became the terminus for suburban electric trains. In 1924, an eighth-metre-long turntable was provided at the station, to turn the AEC railmotor which operated between Reservoir and Whittlesea, making two trips a day. In December 1929, electric train services were extended from Reservoir to Thomastown and, in 1940, the turntable was abolished.

In 1959, duplication of the line to Keonpark station was provided. In 1963, manually operated boom barriers replaced hand-operated gates at the former High Street level crossing, which was at the down end of the station. In 1967, the former ground-level station buildings were provided, replacing the original structures.

In the early hours of 13 July 1975, a deliberately-lit fire damaged Harris motor 567M and Tait motor 345M, both of which were stabled at the station. On 29 December 1980, Harris backing trailer 533BT, which was in a consist operating the 23:15 down service to Epping, was damaged by fire as it arrived at the station.

On 18 December 1986, a number of sidings and signals were abolished. On 1 April 1987, further sidings were abolished. On 8 May 1988, the former signal box and interlocked frame were abolished. Also abolished were two crossovers at the up and down ends of the station, as well as the double line block signalling system between Reservoir and Keon Park, which was replaced with automatic three-position signalling. Pedestrian gates were also installed at the former station pedestrian crossing, which was at the down end, and at the former High Street level crossing. Two months earlier, the double line block system between Bell and Reservoir had been abolished.

In 1991, a reconfigured High Street level crossing was opened, with that arrangement existing until the grade separation of the level crossing in 2019. On 25 June 1996, Reservoir was upgraded to a premium station.

In January 2016, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced that the High Street level crossing would be removed by grade separation. In September 2018, preliminary designs were released, showing that the grade separation would be achieved by elevating the railway, with a new station to be built at the existing location. The winning station design was produced by local architecture firm Genton. Plans for grade separation have dated as far back as the early to mid 1970s.

On 2 December 2019, the ground-level station was closed for demolition, and the new station, above a multi-road intersection, was opened on 16 December of that year. As part of the work, crossovers were reinstated at both the up and down ends of the new station.

<text>Ruthven railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Reservoir, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It opened on 5 August 1963.

== History ==
Ruthven station was named after William Ruthven, who served in both world wars (winning the Victoria Cross in World War I), and was later a member of the Victorian Parliament, representing Preston and then Reservoir. A ceremony was held a day earlier to celebrate the opening, and dignitaries attending included Transport Minister Edward Meagher, and the opposition leader in the Victorian Legislative Council, John Galbally. When it opened, the station building was painted bright red.

In 2022, Ruthven received a $1.03 million upgrade, as part of the &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Big Build&quot; project, including improved facilities and lighting, resurfacing the asphalt on the island platform, new PTV station signage with the red &quot;Clifton Hill group&quot; colour, and a substation constructed opposite Platform 1.

<doc id="708591" wikidata="Q14935178" url="?curid=708591" title="Keon Park railway station">
<text>Keon Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Reservoir, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Keon Park station is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 16 December 1929, with the current station provided in 2024.

Initially opened as Keonpark, the station was given its current name of Keon Park on 29 February 1972.

== History ==
Keon Park station opened on 16 December 1929. It was named after Keon Park Pty Ltd., a land development company formed in 1924. Among the directors was Henry Isaac Cohen, a Barrister, M.L.C. and later a King&#x27;s Counsel, Minister of Education and Minister for Water Supply, who married Ethel Mary Keon in 1901 and whose children adopted the surname of &quot;Keon-Cohen&quot;.

The station opened at the same time as the extension of suburban services and electrification from Reservoir to Thomastown. In November 1959, the line from Reservoir was duplicated, in conjunction with the extension of suburban services to Lalor. However, the duplicated line converged at the up end of the former Keon Parade level crossing, and it was not until 1988 that the current Platform 2 was provided. The crossover, located at the upper end of the station and just past the level crossing, was also provided around this time. It remained the northern extremity for the double line until November 2011, when the line from Keon Park to Epping was duplicated.

In 1963, flashing light signals were provided at the former Keon Parade level crossing, with boom barriers provided later on in 1971. On 15 April 1972, a small fire damaged the interior of the station building. On 1 September 1973, the station was again damaged by fire, as well as damage occurring to the signal box. It was also around this time that the former City of Preston and former local member for the now abolished District of Reservoir, Jim Simmonds, asked the Victorian Railways for opinions on relocating the station to the up side of the level crossing, to allow better access from nearby residential areas.

In 1983, the former ground-level station building was provided, replacing an older timber structure. In 1986, a number of sidings that were located at the down end of the station were abolished.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the level crossing will be grade separated by 2025, with the railway line to be built over the road, and will include a rebuilt station. On 28 March 2022, the LXRP announced that the station would be rebuilt to the south of the current level crossing. In December 2022, final designs were released, with construction on the project beginning in early 2023.

On 12 January 2024, Keon Park Station was closed and demolished. The first elevated train bridge opened on 21 January 2024. The Flinders Street-bound way used the bridge as the Mernda-bound used the level crossing until April 2024, as a solution to keep trains running on the Mernda line.

On 30 April 2024, the Keon Parade level crossing and equipment were eliminated. The elevated train bridge for Mernda-bound way opened on 8 May 2024, and the rebuilt station opened to passengers on 21 June 2024.

== Platforms and services ==
Keon Park has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda line services.

<doc id="708592" wikidata="Q4867181" url="?curid=708592" title="Basil Hennessy">
<text>John Basil Hennessy AO (10 February 1925 – 27 October 2013), was an Australian archaeologist of the Ancient Near East and Emeritus Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney.

==Childhood, early career and education==
Born in Horsham, Victoria, Australia in 1925, the eldest child of Thomas Basil Hennessy and Nell Poultney, Hennessy was educated in nearby Ballarat, before leaving school at 17 to join the Royal Australian Navy. Released from military service in 1946, Hennessy enrolled at the University of Sydney in early 1947 with the intention of studying anthropology. In 1948, however, Arthur Dale Trendall and James Stewart founded the University&#x27;s Department of Archaeology, Hennessy becoming one of their first undergraduates.

==Foreign ventures==
Graduating with a BA Hons in 1950, Hennessy embarked on a tour throughout the Middle East, finishing at Ankara, capital of Turkey where Hennessy held the inaugural student scholarship at the newly created British School of Archaeology in Ankara.

Hennessy returned to Jerusalem at the end of 1951 in order to join the first season of renewed excavations at Jericho under the direction of Kathleen Kenyon. It was at Jericho that Hennessy was exposed to the Wheeler-Kenyon technique of baulk-debris excavation, a technique he was to employ and adapt widely in his own subsequent excavations.

Returning to Australia via London, Hennessy became engaged to Ruth Shannon. The couple were married in 1954 and subsequently had three children.

1954 also saw Hennessy join the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sydney, initially as a temporary lecturer (1954–55, 1957), then later as a full-time lecturer (1958–61). 1962 saw Hennessy and his young family leave Australia once more, in order that Hennessy might pursue postgraduate study at Oxford University, England. During the period 1962-64, Hennessy studied at Magdalen College, completing his DPhil under the supervision of Kathleen Kenyon. His resulting dissertation, entitled &quot;The Foreign Relations of Palestine during the Early Bronze Age&quot;, remains one of the early standard works on that period.

==Years in Jerusalem==
Hennessy&#x27;s completion of his doctorate coincided with the beginning of an intimate association with the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. Appointed Assistant Director of the School in 1965, becoming Deputy Director later the same year, Hennessy achieved the full directorship in 1966, remaining as Director until 1970. During these years, Hennessy directed excavations at the Damascus Gate in the Old City of Jerusalem (1964–66), at the Amman Airport Temple (1966), at Teleilat Ghassul (1967) and at Samaria in 1968.

==Return to Sydney==
Hennessy left Jerusalem in 1970 because of the outbreak of Arab-Israeli hostilities, taking up the Edwin Cuthbert Hall Visiting Professorship in Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney. The chair was fully restored in 1973, Hennessy holding the Sydney professorship from that year until his retirement in 1990, when he was replaced by the current chair, Daniel Potts. During his tenure, Hennessy directed Australian excavations at Teleilat Ghassul (1975–77) and, from 1978 at Pella (initially in association with Wooster College, Ohio). Hennessy was also instrumental in founding the Near Eastern Archaeology Foundation at the University of Sydney in 1986.

==Retirement and honours==
Hennessy was appointed Emeritus Professor of Archaeology after his retirement in 1990 and in 1993 received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from his alma mater, the University of Sydney.

<text>Thomastown railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Thomastown, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Thomastown is a ground-level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 23 December 1889, with the current station provided in 2011.

==History==

Opening on 23 December 1889, when the railway line was extended from Reservoir to Epping, Thomastown station, like the suburb itself, is named after John and Mary Thomas, who began market gardening near Edgars Creek in 1848.

The station was originally serviced by regional trains on the line to Whittlesea. Electrification and suburban services were extended along 4.4 kilometres of single track from Reservoir to Thomastown in 1929, paid for by a land developer, who paid for the works and who also guaranteed against operating losses. From 1931, it was the terminus of the railmotor service from Whittlesea, remaining so until electric suburban services were extended to Lalor in November 1959, with services beyond Lalor discontinued and the line closed.

On 7 August 1967, the original station building was destroyed by fire. In 1969, a new station building, which was of a brick construction, was provided.

In 1968, flashing light signals were provided at the Heyington Avenue level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station. In 1980, boom barriers were provided. By the late 1980s, much of the yard to the east of the station was removed.

On 20 December 1996, Thomastown was upgraded to a premium station.

In September 2007, a VicRoads park &amp; ride upgrade opened, with an additional 100 car spaces opened to the south-east of the station, taking the total to 382. In 2010, 90 additional car parking spaces were provided.

As part of the duplication of the line from Keon Park to Epping, a second side platform was added, and the existing station rebuilt. On 28 November 2011, the current station opened.

==Platforms and services==

Thomastown has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

<text>Lalor railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Lalor, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Lalor is a ground-level staffed station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened in October 1949, with the current station provided in 1978.

Initially opened as [[Rail Motor Stopping Place]] 77, the station was given its current name of Lalor on 27 August 1952.

==History==

Lalor station opened in October 1949, and was provided as part of a garden suburb created by the Peter Lalor Home Building Cooperative Society, which was formed by a group of ex-servicemen to provide cheap homes during a time of high demand and shortage of materials post World War II.

The station was originally served by Whittlesea trains from Melbourne via the former Inner Circle line and, in later times, by Thomastown – Whittlesea railmotor shuttles. In November 1959, the section from Thomastown was electrified, with the line beyond Lalor closed. On 29 November 1964, the line was reopened and electrified as far as Epping. Occurring in that year, the current island platform was provided, and flashing light signals were provided at the Paschke Crescent level crossing, located at the up end of the station.

In 1978, the present station building was provided. In 1980, boom barriers were provided at the Paschke Crescent level crossing.

The current day Platform 1 was formerly a dock platform. In August 1988, points from No. 1 track to the main line were provided at the down end of the station, effectively forming a crossing loop between Thomastown and Epping. This arrangement existed until November 2011, when the line between Keon Park and Epping was duplicated, with the points at both ends of the station abolished.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Lalor to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

Announced as part of a $21.9 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Lalor, alongside other stations, will receive accessibility upgrades, the installation of CCTV, and platform shelters. The development process will begin in late 2022 or early 2023, with a timeline for the upgrades to be released once construction has begun.

Lalor station, like the suburb in which it is located, was originally pronounced , as it was named after Peter Lalor and, although some people still pronounce it as such, in recent times, the pronunciation has become predominant. In addition, the &quot;Victorian Railways Newsletter&quot; of 1973, and &quot;Victorian RailWays&quot; of 1974 (Victorian Railways in-house newsletters) stated that the correct pronunciation was .

==Platforms and services==

Lalor has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Mernda line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Mernda

<text>Epping railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network, and serves the northern suburb of the same name in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It opened on 23 December 1889 and, since 2011, it has been a below-ground, premium station, with an island platform.

==History==
Epping station opened as a stop on the line to Whittlesea, with trains designated as country services. From 1924, an AEC railmotor shuttle service operated from Reservoir to Whittlesea, until the line was closed north of Lalor on 29 November 1959.

On 30 November 1964, a new station opened a little further down the line, as part of the electrification of the line from Lalor to Epping. The station building was relocated from Glen Waverley, which was being rebuilt at the time. On 1 January 1971, the building was damaged by a deliberately lit fire.

During the late 1980s, the station was rebuilt, in conjunction with the construction of the adjacent train depot, with the north face of the former ground level island platform brought into use in July 1987, along with temporary station buildings. The new platform was built on a new alignment, with 200 metres of new track needed to link to the existing line. By the end of that month, the former platform and station building, dating from 1964, were demolished, along with the former alignment of the track and overhead wiring. The south face of the former ground level island platform (Platform 1) was brought into use nine months later, in April 1988. In 1989, new Solid State Interlocking was commissioned, which was the first fully computerised system in Melbourne.

In 1990, the suburban train depot opened, which was a replacement for the Jolimont Workshops in central Melbourne. The depot covers 10.8 hectares, and can accommodate 31 trains, with the facility including a main workshop building, four elevated tracks, two lifting tracks and a train wash. On 23 July 1998, Epping was upgraded to a premium station.

At about 0914 on 18 June 2002, two Comeng train sets collided approximately 1 km south of the station.

In 2010, construction commenced on a new, below-ground island platform north of Cooper Street, as part of a grade separation project in conjunction with the duplication of the line from Keon Park and its extension to South Morang station. The rebuilt station opened on 28 November 2011. The former ground level island platform and building were demolished soon after and, in early 2012, a number of stabling sidings were built on that site.

==Platforms, facilities and services==
Epping has one island platform with two faces and is served by Mernda line trains. Access to the platforms is provided by stairs and a lift. The station concourse contains a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room, toilets and a kiosk. 

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

<text>The Sudbury Basin (), also known as Sudbury Structure or the Sudbury Nickel Irruptive, is a major geological structure in Ontario, Canada. It is the third-largest known impact structure on Earth, as well as one of the oldest. The structure, the eroded remnant of an impact crater, was formed by the impact of an asteroid 1.849 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. The ores of the Sudbury Basin are known to contain nickel, copper, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium.

The basin is located on the Canadian Shield in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario. The former municipalities of Rayside-Balfour, Valley East and Capreol lie within the Sudbury Basin, which is referred to locally as &quot;The Valley&quot;. The urban core of the former city of Sudbury lies on the southern outskirts of the basin.

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the discovery of the Sudbury Basin.

== Formation ==

The Sudbury basin formed as a result of an impact into the Nuna supercontinent from a large impactor body approximately in diameter that occurred 1.849 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era.

Debris from the impact was scattered over an area of thrown more than ; and ejecta—rock fragments ejected by the impact—have been found as far away as Minnesota.

Models suggest that for such a large impact, debris was most likely scattered globally, but has since been eroded. Its present size is believed to be a smaller portion of a round crater that the meteor originally created. Subsequent geological processes have deformed the crater into the current smaller oval shape. Sudbury Basin is the third-largest crater on Earth, after the Vredefort impact structure in South Africa, and the Chicxulub crater under Yucatán, Mexico.

Geochemical evidence suggests that the impactor was likely a chondrite asteroid or a comet with a chondritic component.

== Structure ==
The full extent of the Sudbury Basin is long, wide and deep although the modern ground surface is much shallower.

The main units characterizing the Sudbury Structure can be subdivided into three groups: the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC), the Whitewater Group, and footwall brecciated country rocks that include offset dikes and the Sub layer. The SIC is believed to be a stratified impact melt sheet composed from the base up of sub layer norite, mafic norite, felsic norite, quartz gabbro, and granophyre.

The Whitewater Group consists of a suevite and sedimentary package composed of the Onaping (fallback breccias), Onwatin, and Chelmsford Formations in stratigraphic succession. Footwall rocks, associated with the impact event, consist of Sudbury Breccia (pseudotachylite), footwall breccia, radial and concentric quartz dioritic breccia dikes (polymict impact melt breccias), and the discontinuous sub layer.

Because considerable erosion has occurred since the Sudbury event, an estimated in the North Range, it is difficult to directly constrain the actual size of the diameter of the original transient cavity, or the final rim diameter.

The deformation of the Sudbury structure occurred in five main deformation events (by age in millions of years):

# formation of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (1849 Ma)
# Penokean orogeny (1890–1830 Ma)
# Mazatzal orogeny (1700–1600 Ma)
# Grenville orogeny (1400–1000 Ma)
# Lake Wanapitei impact (37 Ma)

== Origin ==

Some 1.8 billion years of weathering and deformation made it difficult to prove that a meteorite was the cause of the Sudbury geological structures. A further difficulty in proving that the Sudbury complex was formed by meteorite impact rather than by ordinary igneous processes was that the region was volcanically active at around the same time as the impact, and some weathered volcanic structures can look like meteorite collision structures. Since its discovery, a layer of breccia has been found associated with the impact event and stressed rock formations have been fully mapped.

Reports published in the late 1960s described geological features that were said to be distinctive of meteorite impact, including shatter cones and shock-deformed quartz crystals in the underlying rock. Geologists reached consensus by about 1970 that the Sudbury basin was formed by a meteorite impact. In 2014, analysis of the concentration and distribution of siderophile elements as well as the size of the area where the impact melted the rock indicated that a comet rather than an asteroid most likely caused the crater.

The Sudbury Basin is located near a number of other geological structures, including the Temagami Magnetic Anomaly, the Lake Wanapitei impact crater, the western end of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, the Grenville Front Tectonic Zone and the eastern end of the Great Lakes Tectonic Zone, but the structures are not directly related to one another in the sense of resulting from the same geological processes.

== Mining ==

The large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel, copper, palladium, gold, the platinum group and other metals. This magma formed into pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite rocks, as well as cubanite and magnetite.

In 1856 while surveying a baseline westward from Lake Nipissing, provincial land surveyor Albert Salter located magnetic abnormalities in the area that were strongly suggestive of mineral deposits, especially near what later became the Creighton Mine. The area was examined by Alexander Murray of the Geological Survey of Canada, who confirmed &quot;the presence of an immense mass of magnetic trap&quot;.

Due to the then-remoteness of the Sudbury area, Salter&#x27;s discovery did not have much immediate effect. The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the area, however, made mineral exploration more feasible. The development of a mining settlement occurred in 1883 after blasting at the railway construction site revealed a large concentration of nickel and copper ore at what is now the Murray Mine site, named by owners William and Thomas Murray.

The Vermillion Mine, which was the first in the Basin to be exploited, was the site at which Frank Sperry (a chemist of the Canadian Copper Company) made the first identification in 1889 of the arsenide of platinum which bears his name.

As a result of the 1917 Royal Ontario Nickel Commission, which was chaired by Englishman George Thomas Holloway, the legislative structure of the prospecting trade was significantly altered. Some of the Holloway recommendations were in line with the advocacy of Aeneas McCharles, a 19th-century prospector and early mine owner.

As a result of these metal deposits, the Sudbury area is one of the world&#x27;s major mining communities, and has fathered Vale Inco and Falconbridge Xstrata. The Basin is one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of nickel and copper ores. Most of these mineral deposits are found on its outer rim.

===List of mines in the Sudbury Basin===

This list was collected from the 1917 topographic map of the Sudbury Basin, located at right. 
== Soils ==
Most soils in the Sudbury Basin are acidic and sandy; where well drained they usually belong to the Podzol great soil group. Poor drainage results in gleysols and peats. Regardless of drainage or classification, the Basin has deeper soils than the surrounding terrain, much of which is mapped as Rockland (a combination of frequent bedrock outcrops and shallow soil). Consequently, considerable areas in the Basin have been cleared for agriculture. The best soils, mapped as Azilda series and Bradley series, occur around Chelmsford.

== Astronaut training ==
NASA used the site to train the Apollo astronauts in recognizing rocks formed as the result of a very large impact, such as breccias. Those who used this training on the Moon include Apollo 15&#x27;s David Scott and James Irwin, Apollo 16&#x27;s John Young and Charlie Duke, and Apollo 17&#x27;s Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt. Notable geologist instructors included William R. Muehlberger.

<text>A blaa , or Waterford Blaa, is a doughy, white bread bun (roll) speciality, particularly associated with Waterford, Ireland. It is currently made in Waterford and South County Kilkenny.

Blaas are sold in two varieties: &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;crusty&quot;. Soft blaas are slightly sweet, malt flavour, light but firm in texture and melt in the mouth. Crusty blaas are crunchy at first bite, then chewy with a subtle malt taste and a pleasing bitter aftertaste from the well cooked, dark crust.

Eaten mainly at breakfast with butter, they are also eaten at other times of the day with a wide variety of fillings (including a type of luncheon meat often referred to as &quot;red lead&quot;). The &quot;breakfast blaa&quot; (egg, bacon rasher and sausage) is more common than the &quot;breakfast roll&quot; in Waterford.

A combined 12,000 blaas are sold each day by the four remaining bakeries producing blaas: Walsh&#x27;s Bakehouse, Kilmacow Bakery, Barron&#x27;s Bakery &amp; Coffee House and Hickey&#x27;s Bakery. Of the four remaining bakeries, only two remain in Waterford City. Blaas quickly lose their freshness and are best consumed within a few hours of purchase.

Some sources report that the blaa was introduced to Waterford at the end of the 17th century by the Huguenots.
This theory is disputed because although white flour existed in the 17th century, it was not widely used until mass production of the industrial revolution.

Blaas are sometimes confused with a similar bun known as a bap; however, blaas are square in shape, softer, and doughier, and are most notably identified by the white flour shaken over them before the baking process.

On 19 November 2013, the Waterford blaa was awarded Protected Geographical Indication status by the European Commission.

<text>The North London Railway (NLR) company had lines connecting the northern suburbs of London with the East and West India Docks further east. The main east to west route is now part of London Overground&#x27;s North London Line. Other NLR lines fell into disuse but were later revived as part of the Docklands Light Railway, and London Overground&#x27;s East London Line. The company was originally called the East &amp; West India Docks &amp; Birmingham Junction Railway (E&amp;WID&amp;BJR) from its start in 1850, until 1853. In 1909, it entered into an agreement with the London and North Western Railway which introduced common management, and the NLR was taken over completely by the LNWR in 1922. The LNWR itself became part of the LMS from the start of 1923. The railways were nationalised in 1948 and most LMS lines, including the North London route, then came under the control of the London Midland Region of British Railways.

==History==

The East &amp; West India Docks &amp; Birmingham Junction Railway was incorporated by an act of Parliament, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cccxcvi), on 26 August 1846. It was empowered to construct a railway from the district of Poplar and the docks to Camden Town in north London. The railway&#x27;s headquarters and locomotive works were initially in Bow.
The (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. xcvii) renamed the company to the North London Railway.

At first, it ran trains from Bow Junction on the London and Blackwall Railway (L&amp;BR) to Islington, starting on 26 September 1850. The line was extended to Camden Town railway station from 7 December 1850 and to Hampstead Road station (later renamed Primrose Hill) from 9 June 1851. Another extension via the L&amp;BR was opened on 1 January 1852, from Bow Junction to Poplar railway station, and from there to Blackwall and the East India Docks; a connection at Bow allowed trains to run to Fenchurch Street. This arrangement lasted until 1865, when an extension from Dalston Junction to Broad Street was opened; Broad Street became the main terminus, and the Poplar line became a branch. In the meantime, in 1864, a banker on a train from Fenchurch Street to Chalk Farm became the first victim of a murder on a British train. 

In 1869, the line was extended along the North and South Western Junction Railway (a joint enterprise by the LNWR, Midland Railway and the NLR) from Willesden Junction to a London and South Western Railway branch to Richmond. A bypass line from Camden to Willesden Junction via Gospel Oak and West Hampstead opened in 1860. Meanwhile, at the eastern end, a spur line connecting the NLR to Stratford from Victoria Park opened in 1854 but was not used by passenger services. The line between Camden Town and Dalston Junction was quadrupled in 1871.

The LNWR took over the working of the railway under a common management arrangement on 1 February 1909. The company still existed until 1922, with its own board of directors and shareholders, when it was absorbed by the LNWR. The last board meeting and last shareholders meeting were both held on 23 November 1922, the latter giving the shareholders&#x27; approval of amalgamation. The board minutes were signed by A Holland-Hibbert, the chairman, who added &quot;Goodbye!&quot;. Beneath this was typed, &quot;This was the last Board Meeting of the North London Railway Company, the Undertaking being absorbed under “The London and North Western Railway (North London Railway and Dearne Valley Railway) Preliminary Absorption Scheme 1922” by the London and North Western Railway Company as from 1 January 1922.&quot;

The LNWR, which half-owned Broad Street station, was responsible for electrification of the Broad Street to Richmond and Kew Bridge lines in 1916.

==Legacy==

The Kew Bridge service was withdrawn as a wartime economy measure in 1940, which proved to be permanent.

The line from Dalston Junction to Poplar was heavily damaged during the Blitz of World War II. Passenger services from Broad Street to Poplar via Victoria Park and Bow were suspended on 15 April 1944 and officially closed on 14 May 1944. A substitute bus service was provided until 23 April 1945 but the service was finally withdrawn at the end of the war. The northern section of the East Cross Route (A12) built in the late 1960s ran parallel to the rail line between Old Ford and Victoria Park stations, both of which were demolished for the road&#x27;s construction.

The Crosstown Linkline service reinstated passenger service over the Dalston Junction to Victoria Park Junction section of the Poplar branch from 14 May 1979, running from Camden Town to Stratford and then over the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway to North Woolwich. The remaining freight line from Victoria Park Junction to Poplar Docks via Bow Junction closed on 3 October 1983. From 13 May 1985, the Camden to North Woolwich Crosstown Linkline was combined with the Richmond to Broad Street service and ceased to serve Dalston Junction and Broad Street, which finally closed on 30 June 1986.

The line between Willesden Junction and Camden via Primrose Hill is now primarily used (in 2014) for empty coaching stock movements between the North London Line and Willesden Depot, freight trains and, during engineering work, diverted passenger services to and from the Watford DC Line. Primrose Hill station has been closed.

Since 31 August 1987, Docklands Light Railway has followed the path of the North London Railway from Bow Church to Poplar.

The East London Line Extension took over the abandoned stretch between Dalston Junction and Shoreditch from April 2010, incorporating it into the London Overground network.

==Stock==

Among the first locomotives bought by the railway from outside contractors were five 0-4-2ST engines. After that, all were constructed at Bow, London.

==Workshop==

Bow railway works was built in 1853 and had a sizeable wagon repair shop. When the railway was merged into the LMS it was the smallest of 15 workshops. It repaired NLR locomotives and from 1927 those from the former London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR).

In the 1930s, the works developed and manufactured the Hudd automatic control system for the LTSR, which led to a British Rail (BR) team from the national headquarters setting up in Bow to develop BR&#x27;s standard Automatic Warning System. The workshop was badly damaged during the Blitz and the wagon workshop destroyed.

In 1956, the workshop repaired diesel-electric locomotives for the motive power depot at Devons Road (the first to become all-diesel). After a while it was receiving locos in the morning and turning them round by the evening, which initially confused the statistical returns since locos were entering and leaving the works on the same day. The works closed in 1960.

<text>Victoria International Airport serves Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. It is north northwest of Victoria on the Saanich Peninsula, with the bulk of the airport (including the passenger terminal) in North Saanich, and a small portion of the airfield extending into Sidney. The airport is run by the Victoria Airport Authority. YYJ has many nonstop daily flights to Vancouver International Airport (YVR, about 15 minutes), which is a major airport serving many global routes. Additionally, Victoria International has nonstop service to Seattle (SEA), and national service to Ottawa (YOW) (starts on May 15, 2025), Toronto (YYZ), Montreal (YUL, summer only), Calgary (YYC), Edmonton (YEG), and several smaller cities in British Columbia and Yukon. The airport also has seasonal (late fall to early spring) nonstop service to several Mexican resort destinations. Non-stop service between Victoria and the United States decreased by 50% at the beginning of September 2019 when Delta Airlines permanently ended its three daily flights to Seattle, after which only Alaska Airlines continued to fly the route.

Victoria International Airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 450 passengers, when unloaded from the aircraft in stages, or 120 normally. YYJ does not have United States customs and border preclearance, but many passengers fly first to Vancouver International Airport (YVR), which does have U.S. preclearance.

In 2024, YYJ served 1,872,033 passengers and had 95,615 aircraft movements, making it Canada&#x27;s 11th busiest airport in terms of passengers. It was British Columbia&#x27;s third busiest airport in terms of passengers and aircraft movements. The airport is also home to Arundel Castle, the operating base for 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

Like most airports that are run by local authorities in Canada, YYJ charges an airport improvement fee for each outgoing passenger. As of April 2024, it was $25.00 per departing passenger. AIF fees are usually added to fares and collected automatically by most airlines.

==History==
The airport started in 1939 as a grass strip, and was used as a military training airfield. During the early part of World War II (1940–1941), the airfield was used as Royal Air Force Station Patricia Bay, providing basic flight training for Royal Air Force pilots preparatory to returning them to the UK.

In approximately 1942 the aerodrome became a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) installation listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Patricia Bay, British Columbia at with a variation of 24 degrees east and elevation of . The aerodrome was listed with three runways as follows:


The airport is located beside Patricia Bay, which, due to the prevalence of flying boats at the time, proved to be an excellent location. The Department of Transport took over the airport in 1948. It was then called Victoria (Patricia Bay) Airport, and many locals still refer to it as the &quot;Pat Bay Airport&quot;. Trans-Canada Airlines (later Air Canada) began regular service in 1943.

In 1959, the airport was renamed the &quot;Victoria International Airport&quot;.

The last RCAF unit left the airport in 1952. In July 1989, Canadian Forces Air Command returned to Victoria International Airport when HS 443 Squadron, which operated CH-124 Sea King ship-borne anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, was relocated from CFB Shearwater to better support Canadian Forces Maritime Command operations in the Pacific. In 1995, the squadron was redesignated as 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron.

In 1997, as part of a broad scale restructuring of airports across Canada, Transport Canada (formerly the Department of Transport), gave operational control of the airport to the Victoria Airport Authority.

In 2000, the Victoria Airport Authority began the process of renovating and expanding the terminal to meet passenger needs. In 2002, the new airside hold room and the new arrivals rotunda were rebuilt. By 2005, the new departures area was completed.
In May 2005, the federal government, which owns the land, announced a reduction in the rent paid by the Victoria Airport Authority. This will save $0.6 million each year and $12 million over the life of the lease, which is 50 years.

In 2015, 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron moved into a new $155 million heliport at the airport, which the RCAF titled &quot;Arundel Castle&quot; after the major landmark of that name in West Sussex, the English county where the unit operated when it was a fighter squadron flying the Supermarine Spitfire during World War II. The main mission of 443 Squadron in the 21st century is to provide ASW and logistical support for the Royal Canadian Navy. As of 2022, 443 Squadron is responsible for all Canadian west coast operations of the CH-148 Cyclone helicopter.

In July 2016, Westjet Airlines announced that they would be permanently ending service to Honolulu from Victoria. The non-stop route had started in 2009 and had ended due to the lack of demand.

In September 2018, United Airlines announced that the daily United Express flight from Victoria to San Francisco would permanently end on January 7, 2019, concluding over a decade of daily non-stop service between the two cities.

In March 2019, Delta Air Lines announced that all Delta flights from Victoria to Seattle would permanently end on September 2, 2019, concluding a three-year presence by the airline in Victoria and leaving Alaska Airlines as the only airline serving Victoria directly from Seattle or anywhere in the United States. Delta was the second airline to leave Victoria that year, after United Airlines withdrew service in January 2019.

==Terminal==


The main terminal has ten gates, organized as gates 3–4, 5–11, and 12–13. Gates 3-4 and 12-13 are equipped with aircraft loading bridges.

There are three luggage carousels: two located at the arrivals area for domestic passengers, and one for international flights located inside the customs area.

As of December 1, 2010, time limited, ad supported Wi-Fi internet service provided by Telus is available terminal wide.

==Airlines and destinations==
Most commercial flights at Victoria fly either to airports in nearby British Columbia and Alberta or to western Washington. Seasonal scheduled flights by WestJet connect Victoria to tourist destinations in Mexico and Las Vegas. For the Summer 2017 season, Air Canada Rouge operated wide-body Boeing 767s on its daily flights to Toronto.

==Ground transport==

Victoria International Airport is 22 km from downtown Victoria.

It is served by taxi (Yellow Cab).

BC Transit routes 87 and 88 make connections to the airport. Passengers using BC Transit can connect with intercity bus service in Victoria.

By car, the airport is normally a 20-minute drive from downtown Victoria (with little or no traffic, and a 40-minute drive with traffic) via Highway 17.
The airport has short term and long term/daily parking lots next to the terminal with an additional overflow lot. Rental lot is located to the southwest of the terminal building.

A interchange at Highway 17 and McTavish Road, the main highway access point to the airport, was completed in April 2011. Funding for the interchange was shared between the federal, provincial governments and Victoria Airport Authority.

==Fire and rescue==

Victoria International Airport Fire and Rescue operates three crash tenders and one support vehicle to deal with emergencies at the airport. The current station (Airport Fire Service and Airport Operations) opened in 2010 to replace the former station dating back to World War II.

<doc id="708614" wikidata="Q3306502" url="?curid=708614" title="Hod (Kabbalah)">
<text>Hod (Hebrew &quot;Hōḏ,&quot; lit. &#x27;majesty, splendour, glory&#x27;) is the eighth sephira of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is positioned on the left side of the tree beneath Gevurah (severity) and directly opposite Netzach (eternity).

Hod is associated with qualities such as submission, humility, and intellectual rigor. It represents the capacity to comprehend and articulate divine truths, balancing the emotive and instinctual energies of Netzach. This balance is crucial for maintaining the flow of divine energy through the sefirot and manifesting it in the material world. Hod is also linked to the planet Mercury and the archangel Michael in Western esoteric traditions.

==Description==
Hod sits below Gevurah and across from Netzach in the tree of life; Yesod is to the south-east of Hod. It has four paths, which lead to Gevurah, Tiphereth, Netzach, and Yesod.

All the sephirot are likened to different parts of the body and the tree itself to a homunculus. Netzach and Hod are likened to the two feet of a person, the left and right. The feet not only bring a person to their place of intention; integrity here at the base of the pillar is foundational to all that stands above. 

Hasidic Judaism&#x27;s view of &quot;Hod&quot; is that it is connected with Jewish prayer. Prayer is seen as a form of submission; &quot;Hod&quot; is explained as an analogy - that instead of conquering an obstacle in one&#x27;s way, (which is the idea of &quot;Netzach&quot;), subduing oneself to that obstacle is related to the quality of &quot;Hod&quot;.

&quot;Hod&quot; is where form is given by language in its widest sense, being the key to the mystery of form (this may be an adoption of a point of view of Jacques Lacan). Our unconscious desires come from &quot;Netzach&quot;, and are given form in the symbolic realm by &quot;Hod&quot;, manifesting unconsciously through &quot;Yesod&quot; to Malkuth.

==In Western esotericism==
Hod is described as being a force that breaks down energy into different, distinguishable forms, and it is associated with intellectuality, learning and ritual, as opposed to Netzach, Victory, which is the power of energy to overcome all barriers and limitations, and is associated with emotion and passion, music and dancing.

Both these forces find balance in Yesod, foundation, the world of the unconscious, where the different energies created await expression in the lowest world of Malkuth, the Kingdom.

Hod is associated with the god-name of &quot;Elohim Tzabaoth.&quot; The archangel of this sphere is Michael, and the Bene Elohim is the Angelic order. The opposing demonic force of the qlippoth is Samael.

Hod is said to be the sphere in which the magician mostly works. An example is given by occultist and author Dion Fortune in &quot;The Mystical Qabalah&quot;: 

Imagine primitive man is meditating in the wilderness, and comes in contact with, and begins to understand, some energy that surrounds him. So that he can grasp it better, he creates some form, perhaps the form of a god or a symbol, so he has something he can relate to. He then uses that statue or that symbol in future ceremonies to contact that intangible energy once again. This is the role that Hod plays in magic, while the music and dance that may be present in such a ceremony is the role that Netzach might play, providing the raw energy to reach the higher levels of consciousness.

In comparison with Eastern systems, both Hod and Netzach are sometimes associated with the Manipura chakra (solar plexus chakra), which is associated with the breaking down and releasing of energy, anabolism and catabolism.

In &quot;777&quot;, Aleister Crowley associates Hod to the Four Eights of occult tarot among these being Anubis, Thoth, Hanuman, Loki, Hermes, Mercury, Jackal, Hermaphrodite, Opal, Storax, and quicksilver (Not a complete list).

<text>Lake Maggiore (, ; ; ; ; literally &#x27;greater lake&#x27;) or Verbano (; ) is a large lake located on the south side of the Alps. It is the second largest lake in Italy and the largest in southern Switzerland. The lake and its shoreline are divided between the Italian regions of Piedmont and Lombardy and the Swiss canton of Ticino. Located halfway between Lake Orta and Lake Lugano, Lake Maggiore extends for about between Locarno and Arona.

The climate is mild in both summer and winter, producing Mediterranean vegetation, with many gardens growing rare and exotic plants. Well-known gardens include those of the Borromean and Brissago Islands, that of the Villa Taranto in Verbania, and the Alpinia Botanical Garden above Stresa.

Lake Maggiore is drained by the river Ticino, a main tributary of the Po. Its basin also collects the waters of several large lakes, notably Lake Lugano (through the Tresa), Lake Orta (through the Toce) and Lake Varese (through the Bardello).

==Geography==
Lake Maggiore is long, and wide, except at the bay opening westward between Pallanza and Stresa, where it is wide. It is the longest Italian lake, although Lake Garda has a greater area. Its mean height above the sea level is 193 metres; a deep lake, its bottom is almost everywhere below sea-level: at its deepest, 179 metres below. Its form is very sinuous so that there are few points from which any considerable part of its surface can be seen at a single glance. If this lessens the effect of the apparent size, it increases the variety of its scenery. While the upper end is completely alpine in character, the middle region lies between hills of gentler form, and the lower end advances to the verge of the plain of Lombardy. Lake Maggiore is the most westerly of the three great southern prealpine lakes, the others being Lake Como and Lake Garda.
The lake basin has tectonic-glacial origins and its volume is . The lake has a surface area of about , a maximum length of (on a straight line) and, at its widest, is . Its main tributaries are the Ticino, the Maggia (forming a very large delta), the Toce (by which it receives the outflow of Lake Orta) and the Tresa (which is the sole emissary of Lake Lugano). The rivers Verzasca, Giona, and Cannobino also flow into the lake. Its outlet is the Ticino which, in turn, joins the river Po just south-east of Pavia.

The lake&#x27;s jagged banks are surrounded by the Pennine and Lepontine Alps, and Lugano Prealps. Prominent peaks around the lake are the Gridone, Monte Tamaro, Monte Nudo and the Mottarone. The highest mountain overlooking Lake Maggiore is Monte Rosa (), located about west of it. The western bank is in Piedmont (provinces of Novara and Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola) and the eastern in Lombardy (province of Varese), whereas the most northerly section extends into the canton of Ticino, where it constitutes its lowest point above sea level as well as that of Switzerland. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Grenzgipfel summit of Monte Rosa at above sea level.

===Climate===

Lake Maggiore weather is humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). During winter, the lake helps to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding region (since water releases heat energy more slowly than air). The temperatures are cooled down in summer by the breezes that blow on the water&#x27;s surface, changing its colour. The area enjoys nearly 2300 hours of sunshine a year and an average annual temperature of . The water of the lake has a comfortable temperature of in July and August. In winter snowfall is erratic and primarily affects the higher elevations. Rainfall is heaviest in May and lowest during the winter months.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The flora is strongly influenced by the lake basin, which has allowed the proliferation of typically Mediterranean plants, and also of plants native to the Atlantic areas favoured by the composition of the soil and the abundance of siliceous rocks. Lemons, olive trees and bay olive trees grow there. The spontaneous vegetation is composed of yew, holly and chestnut trees on the surrounding hills.

The lake is a habitat to two species of whitefish, &quot;Coregonus&quot; and, less widespread, &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;. Both live in deep water and come ashore only during the spawning in early December. There are also perch, pike, chub, burbot, torpedo, eels and &quot;Alburnus arborella&quot;. The lake is home to several species of nesting waterfowl, it also represents an important corridor, a place of rest and feeding for migrations. For example: common merganser, mute swan, grebes, gulls, cormorants, ducks.

A number of exotic species have established themselves in the lake, including pikeperch, which has been recorded since 1977; wels catfish, which was first noticed in the early 1990s; and ruffe, introduced in the mid-1990s. Wels catfish in excess of 50 kg in weight have been fished from the lake.

==Sacro Monte di Ghiffa==
The Sacred Mountain of Ghiffa is a Roman Catholic devotional complex in the &quot;comune&quot; of Ghiffa, (Piedmont, northern Italy), overlooking Lake Maggiore. It is one of the nine Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy, included in the UNESCO World Heritage list.

==Events==
The Spirit of Woodstock Festival is an annual open air festival at the end of July/beginning of August. It is organized in Armeno by the Mirapuri community.

==History==
The first archaeological findings around the lake belong to nomadic people living in the area in prehistoric types. The first settlements discovered date from the Copper Age. Along the shores of the lake, between the 9th and 4th centuries BC. J.-C., the Golasecca culture, a Celtic civilization of the Iron Age developed. The latter was in turn conquered by the Romans, who called the lake &quot;Verbanus Lacus&quot; or &quot;Lacus Maximus&quot;. In Roman times a maritime line was created that linked the lake, thanks to Ticino, to Pavia, from where the ships would then continue along the Po to the Adriatic Sea.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the lake was under different domains. Most of the current settlements originated in the Middle Ages when the lake was under the Della Torre, Visconti, the Borromeo and Habsburg families.

Clashes also took place on the waters of the lake between military fleets, such as in 1263, when the Della Torre ships fought against those of the Visconti near Arona or, between 1523 and 1524, when the Borromeo clashed against Francesco II Sforza and in 1636 between French and Spanish always in the waters between Arona and Angera.

From the fourteenth century until the end of the eighteenth century, navigation on the lake and on the Ticino was also used to transport the heavy blocks of marble obtained from the quarries located around the lake towards the main Lombard construction sites: the cathedral of Milan and the Certosa di Pavia.

Methane was first discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta as he analysed marsh gas from Lake Maggiore, between 1776 and 1778.

From the middle of the 19th century, the lake began to experience strong tourist development, particularly after Queen Victoria&#x27;s stay in Baveno in 1879.

In 1936, a Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster, built in 1925, was sunk in the lake by employees of Zürich architect Marco Schmucklerski, when Swiss customs officials investigated whether he had paid taxes on the car. The Bugatti was attached to an iron chain making it possible to recover it once the investigation was over, yet that never happened. When the chain corroded, the car sunk to the lake bed, where it was rediscovered on 18 August 1967 by local diver Ugo Pillon and became a favourite target for divers thereafter. When one of the divers, Damiano Tamagni, was killed in a hold-up on 1 February 2008, his friends from the Ascona divers&#x27; club decided to lift and sell the car wreck to raise funds for a yet-to-be-created foundation named after the victim. The remains of the Bugatti were recovered on 12 July 2009. The sale took place at the Retro Mobile classic car exhibition in Paris on 23 January 2010. It was sold for €260,500.

In May 2021, a cable car collapsed near the lake, killing 14 people.

In May 2023 a boat capsized in a storm while travelling between Arona and Sesto Calende, killing 4 people. Among the dead were 2 Italian intelligence agents as well as a former agent of Mossad. 

==The Hotel Meina incident at Lake Maggiore==
This incident is part of the Lake Maggiore massacres during WWII.
Meina is a municipality located northwest of Milan, on the southern shores of Lake Maggiore. The Hotel Meina was located north of the town of Meina and was owned by Alberto and Eugenia Behar, Sephardic Jews who had moved to Italy from Constantinople. In September 1943, an armistice was declared between Italy and the Allies. At that time, the Hotel Meina housed a number of Jewish guests, most of them escapees of the Nazi occupation of Greece. The area around Lake Maggiore was not under Allied control but was occupied by the German Waffen-SS, specifically the infamous &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;. Captain Hans Krüger, who directed operations in Meina and the surrounding villages, was in charge of locating the Jews in that area and was responsible for the Lake Maggiore massacres in which approximately 54 Jews were murdered.

On the night of 22 September 1943, most of the Jewish residents of the Hotel Meina were executed and their bodies were thrown into Lake Maggiore. The Fernandez-Diaz family, a family of Greek Sephardic Jews from Thessaloniki, barricaded themselves in one of the fourth-floor hotel rooms. It took an extra day for the Germans to reach and execute them. The family included three young children whose lives were not spared despite pleas from older family members. Among those killed were Dino Fernandez-Diaz (76 years old), Pierre Fernandez-Diaz (46), Liliane (Scialom) Fernandez-Diaz (36), Jean Fernandez-Diaz (17), Robert Fernandez-Diaz (13), Blanchette Fernandez-Diaz (12), Marco Mosseri (55), Ester Botton (52), Giacomo Renato Mosseri (22), Odette Uziel (19), Raoul Torres (48), Valerie Nahoum Torres (49), and Daniele Modiano (51). In total, sixteen Jewish residents of the hotel were executed. Its owners, the Behar family, survived due to the efforts of the Turkish consulate.

The Italian police report on the Meina massacre was lost but resurfaced in 1994, along with hundreds of other files of war crimes committed post-armistice by Germans who still occupied or were retreating from Italian soil. These files had been hidden in a wooden cabinet, the so-called &quot;cabinet of shame&quot;, discovered in a storeroom of the military prosecutor&#x27;s headquarters.

Germany does not extradite its citizens convicted of war crimes in other countries. Those responsible for the Meina massacre were tried at home in Germany in 1968, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. However, in 1970, the German Supreme Court declared the statute of limitations for those particular war crimes to have expired, and the prisoners were released.

==References in literature and popular culture==
Lake Maggiore is featured in American writer Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. The protagonist (Frederic Henry) and his lover (Catherine Barkley) are forced to cross the transnational border within the lake in a row boat to escape Italian carabinieri.

It also appeared as the location of a fictional racetrack in the racing game &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot;.

Die Flippers, a German Schlager group wrote a song called &quot;Lago Maggiore&quot; that appears on their 1990 album Sieben Tage Sonnenschein.

<doc id="708629" wikidata="Q4705897" url="?curid=708629" title="Alamein line">
<text>The Alamein line is a commuter railway line on the Melbourne metropolitan railway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, the line is coloured dark blue and is one of the four lines that constitute the Burnley group. It is the city&#x27;s second shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Alamein station in the east, serving 18 stations via Burnley, Camberwell, Riversdale, and Ashburton.

The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with all-night service on Fridays and Saturdays. During peak hours, headways of up to 15 minutes are operated with services every 10–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Alamein line run with one or two three-car formations of X&#x27;Trapolis 100 trainsets.

Sections of the Alamein line opened as early as 1898, with the line fully extended to Alamein by 1948. The Alamein line was originally part of the Outer Circle line which operated from 1890 until its closure in 1897. The line was built to connect Melbourne with the suburb towns of Camberwell and Ashburton, amongst others previously served by the Outer Circle line. Minor upgrades have occurred since its opening, including historical level crossing removal works and regular infrastructure upgrades.&quot;&quot;

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

What is now known as the Alamein line was opened as the Outer Circle Railway between 1890 and 1891. The segment still in use today was opened on 24 March 1890.

=== 20th century ===
The section from Camberwell to Ashburton was reopened 4 July 1898 and was operated by a steam locomotive and single carriage. The northern section, from Riversdale to Deepdene, was reopened on 14 May 1900, with a steam train, known locally as the Deepdene Dasher, running between Ashburton and Deepdene at ~90-minute intervals, connecting at East Camberwell on the lower platform. The Deepdene Dasher was the last passenger steam train in suburban Melbourne.

Electrification of the Melbourne suburban rail network commenced in the 1920s. In 1923, the Railway Commissioners decided not to electrify the line from Deepdene through Riversdale to Ashburton, due to insufficient traffic levels, but would keep the issue under review. Their position was partly reversed, with the Camberwell to Ashburton section later being included in the project. The last steam train ran to Ashburton on 29 October 1924 with electric train services commencing three days later in the form of shuttle trains from Camberwell to Ashburton, running every 40 minutes. On 15 August 1926, the last steam train the Deepdene Dasher ran, and was replaced by a pair of AEC railmotors coupled back to back. The Commissioners intended to electrify the line if the volume of traffic increased, but that did not occur, and the service was replaced by road bus on 10 October 1927. The electrified suburban service remains as today&#x27;s Alamein line.

The line from Camberwell to the terminus was a single line with no crossing loops provided. The single train running operated a shuttle service along the line from Camberwell. Staff and Ticket safeworking was used, except between Camberwell and Riversdale where Lever Locking &amp; Track Control was provided on 2 November 1924. Patronage and revenue on the line doubled after electrification, and on 12 October 1925 a 30 to 45 minute connecting service was provided to Ashburton. From 26 November 1928 two trains were provided at peak hours, with a new crossing loop provided at Hartwell. Through trains to the city at peak hour were provided from 17 May 1934. From 3 October 1938 the daytime off peak frequency was improved to 15 minutes.

On 28 June 1948, the line was extended to the new Housing Commission of Victoria estate of Alamein, with some services extended to the new terminus. After World War II, as part of Operation Phoenix, plans were drawn up to duplicate the line and provide a flying junction connection at Camberwell. It was authorised in 1951, but was delayed due to funding issues and other competing projects. The first long stage opened on 7 November 1954, from Hartwell to Ashburton stations, followed by the duplication and automatic signalling of the stretch of line from Riversdale to Hartwell section on 31 July 1955. From 15 July 1955, Ashburton station ceased to be a regular terminus. However, reduced loan funds for railway construction during 1955 and 1956 delayed the rest of the works, with the overpass and new line at Camberwell finally commissioned on 29 November 1959. The last stage of the works had to wait until 8 November 1962 when automatic signalling was introduced between Hartwell and Ashburton, and the signal bay at Hartwell closed.

From 9 July 1972, the service was cut to every hour on Sundays, and from 10 December 1973 it was changed to 20 minutes during the day and every 40 minutes at night and on Saturday afternoons. Through trains to Flinders Street off-peak were provided from 20 January 1975 at a frequency of every 15 minutes Monday to Friday, with Box Hill trains running express from Camberwell. 

Moves were made to close the line or convert it to light rail in the 1980s, as well as plans under the Kennett government to close the line in the early 1990s. However, the Alamein line has remained open well into the 21st century.

=== 21st century ===
The 2000s saw the introduction of the X&#x27;Trapolis 100 rolling stock on the line. The new stock features three doors per side on each carriage with the ability to accommodate up to 456 seated passengers in each six-car configuration.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Alamein line operate from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 10–20 minutes while services during non-peak hours drop to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. Due to the limited number of passengers on the Alamein line, services operate as a shuttle in off-peak times to Camberwell instead of continuing into the central business district. On Friday and Saturday nights, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Alamein line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===
The Alamein line has had a total of 6 operators since its opening in 1898. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from its first service in 1898 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and Hillside Trains have a combined operational length of 101 years. Hillside Trains was privatised in August 1999 and later rebranded as Connex Melbourne. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. Both private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Alamein line forms a relatively straight route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Alamein. The route is long and is predominantly doubled-tracked, however between Flinders Street station and Richmond, the track is widened to 12 tracks, narrowing to 4 tracks between Richmond and Burnley, to 3 track between Burnley and Camberwell, and to two tracks after Camberwell . After Ashburton, the line is narrowed to a single track which remains till its terminus in Alamein. After departing from its terminus at Flinders Street, the Alamein line traverses gentle hills with moderately heavy earthworks for most of the line. Some sections of the line have been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. As of 2020, there are two level crossings remaining on the line with no current plans to remove them. 

The line follows the same alignment as the Belgrave, Glen Waverley, and Lilydale lines with the Glen Waverley line splitting off after Burnley and the three remaining services splitting off at Camberwell. The Alamein line continues on its southern alignment, whereas the Belgrave and Lilydale lines takes an eastern alignment towards their final destinations. All of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs towards its terminus in Alamein.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 18 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground-level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===
The Alamein line uses X&#x27;Trapolis 100 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a one or two three-car configuration, with three doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 456 seated passengers in each six-car configuration. The trains were originally built between 2002 and 2004 as well as between 2009 and 2020 with a total of 212 three-car sets constructed. The trains are shared with 7 other metropolitan train lines and have been in service since 2003.

Alongside the passenger trains, Alamein line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. Less than half of stations on the line are fully accessible as they haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Individual station upgrade projects have helped improve station accessibility on the line, however, only 40% of stations on the line are fully wheelchair accessible. 

=== Signalling ===
The Alamein line uses three-position signalling, which is used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced on the line in 1919, with the final section to Ashburton converted to the new type of signalling in 1962. Since Ashburton and Alamein stations are very close to each other, the single track between the two stations uses station limits working.

<doc id="708632" wikidata="Q276161" url="?curid=708632" title="Krystyna Łybacka">
<text>Krystyna Maria Łybacka (; 10 February 1946 – 20 April 2020) was a Polish political figure who served in the country&#x27;s national Parliament (Sejm), since 1991 to 2014 and from October 2001 to May 2004, and was a member of the cabinet, with the title of Minister of National Education.

A native of the small, west-central town of Jutrosin in Greater Poland Voivodeship&#x27;s Rawicz County, Łybacka received her degree from the mathematics/physics/chemistry department at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. Earning a doctorate from the Mathematics Institute of Poznań University of Technology in 1976 with the thesis, &quot;Random Division of a Square&quot;, she remained on the faculty of the Institute&#x27;s Electrical Engineering department. A member of Polish Mathematical Society since 1969, wherein 1983-1986 she was a secretary, and in 1986-1989 - a member of the board of the Poznań Branch of the Polish Mathematical Society.

During the years 1978–89, she was a member of Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, the name used by the communist party ruling Poland between 1948 and 1989 and, in 1993, joined its successor party, the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, becoming, in 1996, its leader in Poznań. In 1999, she rose to the head of Poznań voivodeship sejmik [council] and, in December, to the deputy leader of the Democratic Left Alliance&#x27;s national leadership council. Starting with modern Poland&#x27;s first entirely free election, in 1991, she was re-elected to the Sejm in each subsequent poll, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2007, serving on various committees, including the National Defense Committee and the Special Services Committee. In her 3rd term, she was deputy head of the Committee for Education, Study, and Youth, a position she also held in the 5th term.

In the aftermath of the 23 September 2001 parliamentary election, Prime Minister Leszek Miller asked her to join his cabinet in the position of Minister of National Education and Sport, which she fulfilled for the following two-and-a-half years from 19 October 2001 until 2 May 2004. Subsequently, in 2004–05, she was deputy leader of the Democratic Left Alliance&#x27;s Parliamentary Club. Following her win in the 2007 election, with 24,405 votes in the Poznań constituency, she switched, on 22 April 2008, to the new Left grouping formed from the dissolved Left and Democrats.

In 2014 she was elected as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Democratic Left Alliance party. In 2019, Łybacka received the Education, Culture and Media Award at &quot;The Parliament Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual MEP Awards.

<doc id="708638" wikidata="Q16149111" url="?curid=708638" title="Governor of Oregon">
<text>The governor of Oregon is the head of government of Oregon and serves as the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The title of governor was also applied to the office of Oregon&#x27;s chief executive during the provisional and U.S. territorial governments.

The current governor of Oregon is Tina Kotek, who took office on January 9, 2023. The governor&#x27;s salary as of 2018 is $98,600.

== Constitutional descriptions ==
Article V of the Oregon State Constitution sets up the legal framework of the Oregon Executive Branch.

===Eligibility===
Article V, Section 1 states that the governor must be a U.S. citizen, at least 30 years of age, and a resident of Oregon for at least three years before the candidate&#x27;s election. Section 2 extends ineligibility as follows:

Section 1 further sets the maximum number of consecutive years a governor may serve, specifying that

There is no specified limit on the number of total terms. John Kitzhaber is the only governor to have served non-consecutive terms. Kate Brown, who completed Kitzhaber&#x27;s final term after his resignation, was elected to an additional four-year term but was ineligible to run for a second term due to the restriction on serving more than eight years in a twelve-year span.

===Elections and terms of office===

Sections 4-7 of Article V outline the formal gubernatorial election procedures such as publishing the winner, ties, disputed elections, and terms of office.

The formal process of certification of results of a gubernatorial election ends when the Secretary of State delivers the results to the Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. The Speaker then will publish the results to a joint session of the Oregon Legislative Assembly.

Where an election results in a tie, a joint session of the next legislative session will vote on the two candidates, and declare the winner governor. Legally contested elections are also decided by the full legislature in whichever manner other laws may prescribe.

===Line of succession===

The gubernatorial line of succession was modified in 1920, 1946, and 1972. The current list is designated as Article V, Section 8a. It defines who may become or act as the governor of Oregon upon the incapacity, death, resignation, or removal from office of a sitting governor. The new governor (or acting governor) will serve out the remainder of the previous governor&#x27;s or incapacitated governor&#x27;s term. A special gubernatorial election is required, if there&#x27;s more than two years remaining in the previous governor&#x27;s or incapacitated governor&#x27;s term. Unlike many states, Oregon does not have a Lieutenant Governor (though in 2007, legislation was proposed to establish such an office.) The current order is:

====Transition events====
Four governors have died in office, and five governors have resigned.
*After La Fayette Grover resigned in 1877 to become a United States Senator, Secretary of State Stephen F. Chadwick took office; he completed Grover&#x27;s term and did not seek re-election.
*After George Chamberlain resigned in 1909 to become a United States Senator, Secretary of State Frank W. Benson took office.
*After Benson fell ill in 1910, he transferred his powers to President of the Senate Jay Bowerman, who was sworn in as Acting Governor. Bowerman then became governor upon Benson&#x27;s resignation, and was defeated in the 1910 gubernatorial election.
*After the death of James Withycombe in 1919, Secretary of State Ben W. Olcott took office; he completed Withycombe&#x27;s term and was defeated in the 1922 general election.
*After the death of Isaac L. Patterson in 1929, President of the Senate A. W. Norblad took office; he completed Patterson&#x27;s term and was defeated in the 1930 Republican primary.
*After the death of Earl Snell in 1947, Speaker of the House John H. Hall took office; he lost a special election in 1948 and did not complete the term.
*After Douglas McKay resigned in 1952 to become United States Secretary of the Interior, President of the Senate Paul L. Patterson took office; he completed McKay&#x27;s term and was elected in his own right in 1954.
*After Patterson&#x27;s death in 1956, President of the Senate Elmo Smith took office; he lost a special election later that year and did not complete the term.
*After John Kitzhaber resigned in 2015 amid a growing ethics scandal, Secretary of State Kate Brown took office; she won a special election in 2016 and was re-elected in 2018.

===State military forces===
The governor is the commander-in-chief of the Oregon Military Department. Power is granted to the governor to mobilize and deploy state military forces.

===Pardons===
The power to grant pardons and reprieves and to commute sentences is granted to the governor, with limitations placed upon cases of treason. Additionally, the governor can remit fines and forfeitures. Any use of these powers, however, must be reported to the legislature.

In treason cases, the governor may only grant reprieves. The final matter of pardons, commuting of sentencing, or further reprieves is referred to the legislature in these cases.

===Legislative===
The governor has the power to veto legislation, which can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in both houses of the legislature, and can veto particular items from an appropriations or emergency bill while leaving others intact (see line item veto).

If needed, the governor may convene a special session of the legislature by proclamation and is empowered to call for special elections to fill vacant seats. Between the vacancy and special election, the governor is able to appoint a replacement if the appropriate county boards are unable to do so within the designated time period.

Annually, the governor addresses the legislature in their State of the State address. In this speech the governor outlines the current conditions of the state, and makes recommendations to the assembly as to what the government&#x27;s priorities ought to be.

===Appointments===
If the legislature is out of session, the governor may appoint replacements to fill state offices until elections are held or the legislature reconvenes (see recess appointment).

== Official residence ==

Mahonia Hall in Salem is the official governor&#x27;s mansion.
The house was built in 1924 for hops grower Thomas A. Livesley. It was named Mahonia Hall after citizens raised funds in 1988 to purchase it as Oregon&#x27;s first official governors&#x27; mansion.

Before the purchase of Mahonia Hall, whatever house the governor rented became the &quot;Governor&#x27;s mansion&quot;. Governors Atiyeh and McCall lived in the 1929 Stiff-Jarman House, an English cottage-style (also characterized as Arts and Crafts style) residence in the North Capitol Mall Historic Redevelopment area. After the end of Atiyeh&#x27;s term, the Stiff-Jarman House became the headquarters of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Today the building houses rented offices.

== Provisional government (1843–1849) ==

Meetings at Champoeg led up to the first constitution of the Oregon Country, and a petition for U.S. territorial status. The resulting acts also created this body as a provisional government for the region. The first executives of this government were a three-person, elected committee known as the Executive Committee. In 1845, elections for a chief executive were held. The first person in Oregon to hold the title of governor was George Abernethy, a prominent businessman.

<text>Amjad Farooqi (; – September 26, 2004), alias Amjad Hussain, was a Pakistani militant who operated in Indian-administered Kashmir, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

==Background==
Farooqi was believed to have been involved in the 1995 kidnapping of Western tourists in Jammu and Kashmir, and under the alias &quot;Mansur Hasnain&quot;, was suspected to be one of the hijackers of Indian Airlines Flight 814, which was rerouted to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1999.

He was allegedly involved in the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002, and, along with Abu Faraj al-Libbi, the assassination attempts on Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on 14 and 25 December 2003. Farooqi was also suspected of having been an associate of al-Qaeda terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

Pakistani security forces launched a massive manhunt for Farooqi and other terrorists in May 2004, and eventually cornered him in his safehouse in Nawabshah, Sindh, where he was subsequently killed following a two-hour-long gunfight.

Farooqi was a member of Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamic terrorist group that was founded by Pakistani militant Masood Azhar following his release by India as part of prisoner negotiations after the Pakistani Militant&#x27;s hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in December 1999.

<text>Robert Dickson (July 23, 1944 – March 19, 2007) was a Canadian poet, translator and academic. Born and raised in Erin, Ontario, he spent much of his life and career living in Sudbury.

He studied French language and literature at the University of Toronto and Université Laval, receiving his doctorate in 1972, and spent his academic career as a professor for the Department of French Studies and Translation at Laurentian University in Sudbury. He won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French language poetry in 2002, for his book &quot;Humains paysages en temps de paix relative&quot; ().

His first poetry collection, &quot;Une bonne trentaine&quot; () was published by The Porcupine&#x27;s Quill in 1975, the only French language work ever published by that company. A poem from that collection, &quot;Au nord de notre vie&quot;, was set to music by the folk rock group CANO, and came to be adopted as an anthem of Franco-Ontarian culture. His later poetry collections, all published by Prise de parole, included &quot;Or(é)alité&quot; (1978, ), &quot;Abris nocturnes&quot; (1986, ), &quot;Grand ciel bleu par ici&quot; (1997, ) and &quot;Libertés provisoires&quot; (2005, ).

A compilation of his poetry, translated into English by Jo-Anne Elder, was published by Guernica Editions under the title &quot;Human Presences and Possible Futures&quot; (2013, ).

He also translated both French and English literary works, including English translations of works by Jean-Marc Dalpé and French translations of works by Tomson Highway and Lola Lemire Tostevin.

Over the course of his career, he was also awarded the Prix du CCRCF from the University of Ottawa&#x27;s Centre for Research on French Canadian Culture and the Prix Nouvel-Ontario, and was named to the Ordre de la Pléiade in 2005.

Dickson died at his home in Sudbury on March 19, 2007, from brain cancer.

<text>Keith Windschuttle (born 1942) is an Australian historian. He was appointed to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 2006 to 2011. He was editor of &quot;Quadrant&quot; from 2007 to 2015 when he became chair of the board and editor-in-chief. He was the publisher of Macleay Press, which operated from 1994 to 2010.

Major published items include &quot;Unemployment&quot; (1979), which analysed the economic causes and social consequences of unemployment in Australia and advocated a socialist response; &quot;The Media: a New Analysis of the Press, Television, Radio and Advertising in Australia&quot; (1984), on the political economy and content of the news and entertainment media; &quot;The Killing of History&quot; (1994), a critique of postmodernism in the study of history; &quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History: Volume One: Van Diemen&#x27;s Land 1803–1847&quot; (2002), which accuses a number of Australian historians of falsifying and inventing the degree of violence in the past; &quot;The White Australia Policy&quot; (2004), a history of that policy which argues that academic historians have exaggerated the degree of racism in Australian history; and &quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume Three: The Stolen Generations 1881–2008&quot;, which argues the story of the &quot;stolen generations&quot; of Aboriginal children is a myth.

==Biography==

He attended at Canterbury Boys&#x27; High School (where he was a contemporary of Liberal Australian prime minister John Howard).

Windschuttle was a journalist on newspapers and magazines in Sydney. He completed a BA (first class honours in history) at the University of Sydney in 1969, and an MA (honours in politics) at Macquarie University in 1978. He enrolled as a PhD student but did not submit a thesis; instead he published it under the title &quot;The Media&quot; with Penguin Books. In 1973, he became a tutor in Australian history at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Between 1977 and 1981, Windschuttle was lecturer in Australian history and in journalism at the New South Wales Institute of Technology (now the University of Technology, Sydney) before returning to UNSW in 1983 as lecturer/senior lecturer in social policy. He resigned from UNSW in 1993 and founded Macleay Press, a small-press publishing company. Published authors besides Windschuttle include Leonie Kramer and Michael Connor. He has been a regular visiting and guest lecturer on history and historiography at American universities.

In June 2006, he was appointed to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Australia&#x27;s non-commercial public broadcaster, for a 5-year term which ended 14 June 2011.

==Political evolution==
An adherent of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s, Windschuttle later moved to the political right. This process is first evident in his 1984 book &quot;The Media&quot;, which took inspiration from the empirical perspective of the Marxist historian E. P. Thompson, especially his &quot;The Poverty of Theory&quot;, to make a highly critical review of the Marxist theories of Louis Althusser and Stuart Hall. While the first edition attacked &quot;the political program of the New Right&quot; and set out a case for both favouring &quot;government restrictions and regulation&quot; and condemning &quot;private enterprise and free markets&quot;, the third edition four years later (1988) took a different view: &quot;Overall, the major economic reforms of the last five years, the deregulation of the finance sector, and the imposition of wage restraint through the social contract of The Accord, have worked to expand employment and internationalise the Australian economy in more positive ways than I thought possible at the time.&quot;

In &quot;The Killing of History&quot;, Windschuttle defended the practices and methods of traditional empirical history against postmodernism and praised historians such as Henry Reynolds, but he now argues that some of those he praised for their empirically-grounded work fail to adhere to the principle. In the same book, Windschuttle maintains that historians on both sides of the political spectrum have misrepresented and distorted history to further their respective political causes or ideological positions.

In &quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History&quot; and other writings on Australian Aboriginal history, Windschuttle criticises historians who, he claims, have extensively misrepresented and fabricated historical evidence to support a political agenda. He argues that Aboriginal rights, including land rights and the need for reparations for past abuses of Aboriginal people, have been adopted as a left-wing &#x27;cause&#x27; and that those he perceives as left-wing historians distort the historical record to support that cause. For Windschuttle, the task of the historian is to provide readers with an empirical history as close to the objective truth as possible, based on an analysis of documentary, or preferably eyewitness, evidence. He questions the value of oral history. His &quot;view is that Aboriginal oral history, when uncorroborated by original documents, is completely unreliable, just like the oral history of white people&quot;. A historian has no responsibility for the political implications of an objective, empirical history. One&#x27;s political beliefs should not influence one&#x27;s evaluation of archival evidence.

For some of his critics, &quot;historians don&#x27;t just interpret the evidence: they compose stories about these meanings, or in the words of Hayden White, they &#x27;emplot&#x27; the past. This is itself a cultural process&quot;.

Windschuttle&#x27;s research in the early 2000s disputed the idea that the colonial settlers of Australia committed genocide against the Indigenous Australians. He also disputed the widespread view that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. Extensive debate on his work has come to be called the &quot;history wars&quot;. He dismissed assertions, which he imputed to the current generation of academic historians, that there was any resemblance between racial attitudes in Australia and those of South Africa under apartheid and Germany under the Nazis. He has been a frequent contributor to conservative magazines, such as &quot;Quadrant&quot; in Australia, of which he became editor in 2007, and &quot;The New Criterion&quot; in the United States.

In the wake of the 2011 Norway attacks, Windschuttle did not deny that the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, had read and praised statements he had made at a symposium in New Zealand in 2006, but stressed that he was &quot;still at a complete loss to find any connection between them and the disgusting and cowardly actions of Breivik&quot;. Windschuttle went on to add that &quot;it would be a &#x27;disturbing accusation&#x27; if people thought that he had ever used deliberately provocative language that might have caused Breivik to take up a rifle and shoot unarmed teenagers in cold blood&quot;.

==&quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land 1803 – 1847&quot;==
In his &quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One&quot;, the first book of a projected multi-volume examination of frontier encounters between white colonisers and Aboriginal people, Windschuttle criticises the last three decades of historical scholarship which had challenged the traditional view of Aboriginal passivity in the face of European colonisation. His critique specifically challenges the prevailing consensus created by what he called the &quot;orthodox school&quot; of Australian frontier history concerning the violence between indigenous Australians and settlers, by examining the evidence for reported in what is known as the &quot;Black War&quot; against the Aboriginal people of Tasmania. He refers to historians he defines as making up this &quot;orthodox school&quot; as being &quot;vain&quot; and &quot;self-indulgent&quot; for imposing their politics onto their scholarship, and &quot;arrogant, patronizing and lazy&quot; for portraying the Tasmanian Aboriginal people&#x27;s behavior and motivations in terms of European cultural concepts rather than taking the time to understand the cultural concepts of a hunter-gatherer society. Windschuttle&#x27;s &quot;orthodox school&quot; comprises a large number of historians and archaeologists, deceased or living, such as Henry Reynolds, Lyndall Ryan, Lloyd Robson, John Mulvaney, Rhys Jones, Brian Plomley, and Sharon Morgan, whom he regards as responsible for a politicised reading of the past, and for inflating the number of Aboriginal deaths. Reviewing their work, he highlights multiple examples of what he alleges are misrepresented sources, inaccurate reportage or the citation of sources that do not exist. His work on sources constitutes, according one critic, his most damaging contribution to the subject, though Stuart Macintyre argues that Windschuttle &quot;misreads those whom he castigates&quot;.

Windschuttle challenges the idea that mass killings were commonplace, arguing that the colonial settlers of Australia did not commit widespread massacres against Indigenous Australians; he drastically reduces the figures for the Tasmanian Aboriginal death toll, and writes that Aboriginal people referred to by both Reynolds and Ryan as resistance figures, included &quot;black bushrangers&quot; and others engaged in acts normally regarded as &quot;criminality&quot;; arguing that the evidence clearly shows that attacks by Aboriginal people on settlers were almost invariably directed at acquiring goods, such as flour, sugar, tea and tobacco, and that claims by orthodox historians that this was a form of guerrilla warfare against British settlement aren&#x27;t supported by credible evidence. Vicki Grieves argues that Windschuttle regards Aboriginal men who traded their women&#x27;s services as pimps, although Windschuttle does not use the term. Adducing the work of a source who Stuart Macintyre claims is &#x27;a particularly tendentious American anthropologist&#x27;, he argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal society was primitive, dysfunctional and on the verge of collapse, because their putative maltreatment of women impaired their ability to reproduce in a number of critical ways. Windschuttle agrees with earlier historical analysis, such as that of Geoffrey Blainey, that introduced disease was the primary cause of the demise of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people. He is highly critical of recent historical scholarship, arguing that much of it ignores the scholar&#x27;s basic duties to be objective and true to the evidence, and he advances a sympathetic analysis of settler opinion, arguing that historians such as Henry Reynolds had misrepresented the contents of records of settler opinion to conceal the fact that the majority of settlers were consistently in favour of the protection of Aboriginal people. He also criticises Aboriginal land right politics, arguing that it has resulted in many Aboriginal people being effectively confined to remote settlements far from viable employment opportunities and from the benefits of a modern society. His own examination of archives, contemporary newspapers, diaries and official accounts yields a provisory figure of approximately 120 deaths of Tasmanian Aboriginal people &quot;for which there is a plausible record of some kind&quot; as having been killed by settlers, as opposed to earlier figures ranging as high as 700, and thus far less than the number of whites (187) reported as killed during the &quot;Black War&quot; of 1824 to 1828 by Aboriginal people. Windschuttle argues that the principles of the Enlightenment, fused with the 19th century evangelical revival within the Church of England and Britain&#x27;s rule of law had a profound effect on colonial policy and behaviour, which was humane and just, that together made the claimed genocide culturally impossible. Gregory D. B. Smithers argues that Windschuttle interpreted settler violence as self-defence.

Windschuttle argues that encroaching pastoralism did not cause starvation through the loss of native hunting grounds as some historians have proposed, as their numbers were being drastically reduced by introduced disease, and large parts of Tasmania were not then, or now, occupied by white settlers. Windschuttle&#x27;s estimate of the size of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population at the time of settlement is that it may have been as low as 2,000. Estimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are generally in the range of 3,000 to 8,000 people. Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures, which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were &quot;more numerous than the white people were aware of&quot; but that their population had been decimated by a sudden outbreak of disease prior to 1803. It has been speculated that early contacts with passing ships, exploratory expeditions or sealers before colonization may have caused outbreaks of epidemic disease. The low rate of genetic drift found in a recent genetic study argues that the highest previous estimate of pre-colonial Aboriginal population (8,000) is likely too low and that a significantly higher population cannot be ruled out. He argues that the evidence shows that what the orthodox historians construed as &quot;resistance&quot; by Tasmanian Aboriginal people were acts of theft and violence motivated by their desire for exotic consumer goods like flour, tea, sugar and blankets. The indigenous culture, in his view, &quot;had no sanctions against the murder of anyone outside their immediate clan&quot;, therefore they had no cultural sanctions preventing the killing of settler outsiders to obtain desired goods or in revenge. The forced removal of Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal people from the Tasmanian mainland to Flinders Island was the Colonial Administration&#x27;s measure to ensure peace for hard-pressed settlers while attempting, unsuccessfully to prevent the extinction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people. The rapid decline in the Aboriginal population after the British colonisation was the product of the interaction of a number of factors, including introduced diseases causing death and infertility, continued internecine warfare, deaths through conflict with settlers and the loss of a significant number of women of childbearing age from the full-blooded aboriginal gene pool to white sealers and settlers through abduction, &quot;trade&quot; and by voluntary association.

===Specific issues===

====Treatment of women====
Windschuttle refers to accounts by the French zoologist François Péron, by George Augustus Robinson in his journals, and by the early Australian writer James Bonwick, of the violence and cruelty with which many Tasmanian Aboriginal men were observed to treat women. He notes that the &quot;murder of women because of insult, jealousy and infidelity, was common&quot; and that a woman who refused a particular suitor would often be abducted and raped. He argues that this contributed to the willingness of some Aboriginal women to associate themselves with sealers and settlers rather than their own people, so reducing the full-blooded Aboriginal population&#x27;s ability to reproduce itself. He cites a number of accounts including one published in 1820 by a British officer who had spoken with Aboriginal women living with Bass Strait sealers. The officer reported that Aboriginal women made it known that their (Aboriginal) husbands treat them with &quot;considerable harshness and tyranny&quot; and that they sometimes run away and &quot;attach themselves to the English sailors&quot;, finding &quot;their situation greatly improved by attaching themselves to the sealing gangs&quot;. Windschuttle holds that the willingness of some Tasmanian Aboriginal women to engage in prostitution with convicts, sealers and settlers and the Tasmanian Aboriginal men who &quot;actively colluded&quot; in the trade in their women aided in the transmission of venereal and other introduced diseases to the indigenous population. Windschuttle argues that introduced disease was the primary cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people, not merely by directly causing deaths but also through widespread infertility resulting from introduced venereal disease.

James Boyce, a Tasmanian historian, dismisses Windschuttle&#x27;s argument as &quot;uninformed slander&quot; based on a failure to read the only documentary sources that matter, the journals of French and British explorers recording the first contacts with Tasmanian Aboriginal people before the colonial period. Examining Windschuttle&#x27;s use of sources for the view women were treated like slaves and drudges, he says Windschuttle relies on a selective reading of just two of many sources in an early work by Ling Roth, &quot;written at the height of Social Darwinist orthodoxy&quot; (1899). However, Ling Roth did not &quot;write&quot; these sources; he simply translated the diaries of the first contacts by the French explorers. One is from Péron, who noted scars on women, and interpreted them as signs of domestic violence, which however he had never witnessed. Other early observers took this scarring as an indigenous cultural practice. James Cook had noticed Aboriginal men and women&#x27;s bodies were both incised with scars in the same manner. Péron was less sympathetic than other first observers on the Baudin expedition to Australia. Boyce argues that their observations, including those of the captain Nicolas Baudin, do not support Windschuttle&#x27;s claims. Even Péron records an encounter at Port Cygnet with an Aboriginal group of men and women, who shared a meal of abalone with the French explorers and, according to Péron, provided &quot;the most striking example we had ever had of attention and reasoning among savage people&quot;. Péron would have disagreed, Boyce believes, with Windschuttle&#x27;s claim that &quot;(t)raditional Aboriginal society placed no constraints on the women&#x27;s sexual behaviour with men&quot;, for he was repeatedly rebuffed when he tried to make physical contact with Aboriginal women. Baudin believed that no one on his ship had managed to have sexual relations with the women on Bruny Island. The behaviour adduced by Windschuttle from the other, late report by J. E. Calder (in 1829) is, for Boyce, &quot;self evidently a product of the extensive disruption of traditional life that had occurred by then&quot;. He concludes: &quot;Only someone who is totally blind to the impact of changing power relations, of declining choices, of the profound impact of cultural disintegration and recurring violence and abuse, let alone the simple imperatives of survival, could cite the unfolding tragedy at Bruny Island in this period as evidence for the sexual mores and domestic relations of pre-invasion Aboriginal society&quot;.

Shayne Breen argues that Windschuttle&#x27;s claim is a calculated guess. The picture is however complex. Evidence exists for some use of women as trading commodities. Some women were abducted by sealers, while others were traded by Aboriginal men in attempts to establish reciprocal relations with the sealers. Shayne concludes that: &quot;There is some evidence that Aboriginal men, especially along the northern and south eastern coastlines, used women as trading commodities. Some of this trading was culturally sanctioned, some of it was not. Sometimes women willingly participated, sometimes they did not. But no credible documentary evidence is available for widespread selling of women into prostitution. There is, however, strong evidence that the abduction of women by colonists was practised across the island for much of the period to 1820. Indeed, the 1830 Aborigines Committee found that the abduction of women was a major cause of attacks against colonists by Aborigines&quot;.

In reply to Boyce, Windschuttle argues that Boyce could not have read the whole book, or even properly checked the index, which cited &quot;this very evidence&quot;, i.e. the journals of early French and British explorers. With respect to Boyce&#x27;s claims that Windschuttle was &quot;unaware&quot; of or &quot;ignored&quot; various sources, Windschuttle responded that Boyce&#x27;s claims, based on what was, and was not, in &quot;Fabrication&quot;″s bibliography, misinterpret the purpose of a bibliography. It listed only the sources referred to in the text and in his footnotes, and was not intended as an exhaustive list of every book or document that he had read regarding colonial Tasmania. Windschuttle argues that &quot;were Boyce more familiar with the ethnographic literature&quot;, he would know the most telling evidence about the treatment of women comes not from explorers but the Aboriginal people themselves; from the recorded words of Aboriginal men, such as Woorrady, Montpeliatter, Mannalargenna and Nappelarteyer, and those of Aboriginal women such as Tencotemainner, Truganini and Walyer. Windschuttle did not claim that women had been sold &quot;into prostitution&quot; but that they were, as Breen admits, traded as commodities. Breen, Windschuttle replies, admits such trading and regards this as an admission of the &quot;cruelty of pre-contact indigenous culture&quot;. For Windschuttle, Breen and others can say things that sicken no one, because they contextualise it within a model of British invasion and Aboriginal resistance, whereas he is taken to task for being &quot;pitiless&quot; for making what he argues is the same point, &quot;within a historical model of aboriginal accommodation to a comparatively nonviolent British settlement&quot;.

====Attachment to land====
In reply to his critics, Windschuttle argues that Henry Reynolds &quot;willfully misinterprets&quot; what he wrote, since his argument about Aboriginal concepts of land is based not on their words but on their deeds. &quot;It is not primarily an argument about Aboriginal language but about Aboriginal behaviour. I demonstrated the Tasmanian Aborigines did not act as if they demanded the exclusive usage of land. They had no concept of trespass&quot;.

Windschuttle argues that no word list records an Aboriginal term corresponding to the English word &quot;land&quot; in the sense that Europeans use it, &quot;as a two-dimensional space marked out with definite boundaries, which can be owned by individuals or groups, which can be inherited, which is preserved for the exclusive use of its owner, and which carries sanctions against trespassers&quot;, but states that &quot;they certainly did identify themselves with and regularly hunted and foraged on particular territories, known as their &quot;country&quot;, which I openly acknowledge. They had obvious attachments to these territories. But they did not confine themselves to these regions nor did they deter other Aborigines from entering their own territory&quot;. &quot;Members of the Big River tribe, for instance, annually visited Cape Grim in the north-west, Port Sorell on the north coast, Oyster Bay on the east coast, and Pittwater and Storm Bay in the south-east; that is, they regularly traversed most of the island&quot;. &quot;The strongest evidence for this thesis is actually the history of white colonization and the timing of the conflict that did occur between blacks and whites. Most observers at the time agreed there was very little violence in Tasmania for the first twenty years after the British arrived. And the historians, except Lyndall Ryan, agree there were minimal hostilities before 1824. If the Aborigines had really felt the land was exclusively theirs, they would not have waited more than twenty years after the colonists arrived to do something about it&quot;.

He contrasts this to the fiercely territorial Polynesian tribes of New Zealand, Tahiti and Tonga who fought off the British immediately. &quot;The fact that the Tasmanian Aborigines did not respond in the same way is not to say they didn&#x27;t love their country or were thereby deficient as human beings. They simply had a different culture&quot;.

The University of New England&#x27;s Russell McDougall, in turn, has recently argued that Windschuttle&#x27;s use of Henry Ling Roth&#x27;s word-lists to deny an indigenous Tasmanian concept of &quot;land&quot; constitutes &quot;a wrong-headed attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Aboriginal land claims&quot;, especially since Roth&#x27;s lists made no claim to capture a linguistic totality, and Roth himself cited earlier testimonials to the fact that, though nomadic, the &quot;Tasmanians confined themselves within the boundaries of specific territories&quot;. It was, McDougall argues, the pressing presence of colonisers that forced them to trespass and make war upon each other.

==Critical reception==
The appearance of the first volume provoked a lively polemical correspondence in the pages of &quot;The Australian&quot;, with its &quot;agenda-setting capacity&quot;. It was positively reviewed by Geoffrey Blainey, who called it &quot;one of the most important and devastating (books) written on Australian history in recent decades&quot;, although Blainey notes that not every side-argument in the book convinced him and that his &quot;view is that the original Tasmanians were not as backward, mentally and culturally, as Windschuttle sometimes depicts them&quot;. On Windschuttle&#x27;s analysis of the &quot;fabrications&quot;, Blainey wrote: &quot;While reading the long recital of these failings, I felt an initial sympathy towards the Australian and overseas historians who were under such intense scrutiny. But many of their errors, made on crucial matters, beggared belief. Moreover their exaggeration, gullibility, and what this book calls &quot;fabrication&quot; went on and on. Admittedly, if sometimes the historians&#x27; errors had chanced to favour the Aborigines, and sometimes they had happened to favour British settlers, a reader might sympathetically conclude that there was no bias amongst the historians but simply an infectious dose of inaccuracy. Most of the inaccuracies, however, are used to bolster the case for the deliberate destruction of the Aborigines.&quot; Claudio Veliz greeted it as &quot;one of the most important books of our time&quot;. Peter Coleman, while speaking of its &quot;painstaking and devastating scholarship&quot;, regretted the absence from Windschuttle&#x27;s work of any &quot;sense of tragedy&quot;.

Within a year Windschuttle&#x27;s claims and research produced a volume of rebuttal, namely &quot;Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle&#x27;s Fabrication of Aboriginal History&quot;, an anthology edited and introduced by Robert Manne, professor of politics at La Trobe University, with contributions by Australian academics from a range of disciplines. Manne, who called Windschuttle&#x27;s publication &quot;one of the most implausible, ignorant and pitiless books about Australian history written for many years&quot;, summed up the case against Windschuttle&#x27;s book, noting that its assessment of Aboriginal deaths is based on Plomley, despite the fact that Plomley denied that any estimate regarding such deaths could be made from the documentary record. Manne added further observations, to the effect: that &quot;a scrupulous conservative scholar&quot;, H. A. Willis, using exactly the same sources as Windschuttle, instead came up with a figure of 188 violent deaths and another 145 rumoured deaths; that Windschuttle&#x27;s method excludes deaths of Aborigines who were wounded, and later died; that all surviving Aborigines transported by Robinson to Flinders&#x27; Island bore marks of violence and gunshot wounds &quot;perpetrated on them by depraved whites&quot;; that Windschuttle cannot deny that between 1803 and 1834 almost all Tasmanian Aborigines died, and the only evidence for disease as a factor before 1829 rests on a single conversation recorded by James Bonwick, and that Aboriginal women who lived with sealers did not, however, die off from contact with bearers of foreign disease; that Windschuttle likened Aboriginal attacks on British settlers to &quot;modern-day junkies raiding service stations for money&quot;, whereas both colonial records and modern historians speak of them as highly &quot;patriotic&quot;, attached to their lands, and engaged in a veritable war to defend it from settlement; that by Windschuttle&#x27;s own figures, the violent death rate of Aborigines in Tasmania in the 1820s must have been 360 times the murder rate in contemporary New York; that Windschuttle shows scarce familiarity with period books, citing only 3 of the 30 books published on Van Diemen&#x27;s land for the period 1803–1834, and with one of them confuses the date of the first visit by the French with the publication date of the volume that recounted their expedition; that it is nonsensical to argue that a people who had wandered over an island and survived for 34,000 years had no attachment to their land; that Windschuttle finds no native words in 19th century wordlists for &quot;land&quot; to attest to such an attachment, when modern wordlists show 23 entries under &quot;country&quot;. In turn, this provoked Melbourne writer and Objectivist John Dawson, to undertake a counter-rebuttal, &quot;Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History&quot; in which he argues that &quot;Whitewash&quot; leaves Windschuttle&#x27;s claims and research unrefuted.

In their reviews, Australian specialists in both Aboriginal and indigenous peoples&#x27; history were generally far less impressed than those who praised the book, which included Geoffrey Blainey, Claudio Veliz and Peter Coleman.
*Henry Reynolds interprets his book as an attempt to revive the concept of terra nullius, and regards it as &quot;without doubt, the most biased and cantankerous historical work to appear since the publication of G. W. Rusden&#x27;s three-volume History of Australia in the 1880s&quot;.
*The historian of genocide, Ben Kiernan, who classifies the fate of Aborigines as an example of the practice, situates Windschuttle&#x27;s polemical history within a new campaign, led by &quot;Quadrant&quot;, but taken up by a &quot;chorus of right-wing columnists&quot; within the Australian mass media with a record of antagonism to both Aborigines and their &quot;leftist&quot; supporters.
*Stephen Garton, professor of history, provost and deputy vice-chancellor at Sydney University, argued that &quot;the flaw in Windschuttle&#x27;s argument is his belief that history can only be based on the evidence that survives. Evidence is always partial and only takes on a meaning if placed in an appropriate context. In other words historians always construct larger worlds from the fragments that survive&quot;.
*The University of Aberdeen&#x27;s Gregory D. B. Smithers, an Australian comparativist working on native histories, argues that Windschuttle&#x27;s political agenda shows a &quot;discomfort with the way the &#x27;orthodox school&#x27;, by inflating Aboriginal deaths, impugns Australian identity and its virtuous Anglo-Saxon origins&quot;. Windschuttle&#x27;s book plays to &quot;the white wing populism of white Australians, who feel their racially privileged position is under attack&quot;. By reaction, Smithers argues, Windschuttle highlights &quot;the nation&#x27;s virtues&quot;, privileging the opinions of settlers and colonial officials, &quot;while rejecting Aboriginal oral histories&quot;. Smithers argues that Windschuttle ignores documentary evidence that contradicts his own ideology, and fails to perceive that the island reserves created for indigenous Tasmanians were &quot;racialised spaces&quot; for a people regarded as a form of &quot;social pollution&quot;&quot;. He argues that the book is &quot;a therapeutic history for white (Anglo-Saxon) Australians that distorts and distracts&quot; and that in denying the reliability of historical evidence of racialised groups, Windschuttle employs a tactic used by historians to discredit historical accounts that do not fit with their presentist morality.
*For Stuart Macintyre, Windschuttle&#x27;s book was not &quot;so much counter-history as an exercise in incomprehension&quot;. He finds Windschuttle&#x27;s method of calculating Aboriginal losses flimsy, and the figures he allocates to each incident &quot;no more reliable than those, which he dismissed as guesswork, of mainstream frontier historians&quot;. He concludes that the first volume is &quot;a shocking book, shocking in its allegation of fabrication and also in its refusal of the interpretive framework that earlier historians employed, and that its author &quot;fails to register the tragedy of what was a fatal encounter&quot;. When challenged on his lack of compassion, Windschuttle is reported as replying: &quot;You can&#x27;t really be serious about feeling sympathy for someone who died 200 years ago&quot;. For Macintyre, &quot;It is the absence of any sense of this tragedy, the complete lack of compassion for its victims, that is surely the most disturbing quality of Windschuttle&#x27;s rewriting of Aboriginal history&quot;.
*For University of Sydney historian Vicki Grieves, Windschuttle&#x27;s approach reads as though indigenous people &quot;were not the intentional targets of the colonisers but accidental targets, mostly through their inability to be realistic, objective, logical and moral, and thus the &quot;seeds of their own destruction&quot; lay within their own &quot;psyche and culture&quot;. Even were one to concede Windschuttle&#x27;s guesstimate for the pre-white population of Tasmania, by his own figures, the death-rate for his plausible deaths still works out as higher in percentage terms than the mortality risk of the Australian population during WWI, when 60,000 soldiers died. Windschuttle shows, she argues, a predilection for old colonial explanations, and Darwinist values, as though nothing had happened in between. Regarding native treatment of women, who in his account were viciously brutalised, Windschuttle appeals to the reader&#x27;s moral outrage at the way a 14-year-old native girl was traded. In doing so, he ignores the fact that the age of consent in Britain at that time was 12, and whites themselves on the frontier exchanged wives or traded them for tobacco and rum.
*James Boyce, in an extended review, notes that Windschuttle ignores native views for the period after 1832, precisely the date when almost all of what is known of Aboriginal perspectives began to be recorded. Examining Windschuttle&#x27;s use of sources, he finds his selection of material narrow, and his reading of their contents &quot;selective&quot;.
*Bain Attwood of the School of Philosophical, Historical and International Studies at Monash University dismisses him as a &quot;tabloid historian&quot;. However, Attwood concedes that &quot;Boyce is unable to demonstrate&quot; that the documents he says Windschuttle ignored &quot;would have provided factual killings of Aborigines&quot;, and that revisionist&#x27; critics have demonstrated that the academic historians lacked documentation for most of the killings represented in their accounts&quot;.
*Shayne Breen, lecturer in Aboriginal history at the University of Tasmania, reads the book as &quot;systematic character assassination&quot;, replete with &quot;unsupportable generalizations&quot;, and nurtured by a &quot;delusion&quot; that only Windschuttle can find the historical truth. For Breen, &quot;In making &quot;the most primitive ever&quot; claim, Windschuttle is not practising forensic scholarship. He is renovating a colonial ideology that decreed that Tasmanian Aborigines were the missing link between apes and man. This idea formed a central plank of what is known to scholars as scientific racism&quot;.

==&quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume Three, The Stolen Generations 1881–2008&quot;==

Published in 2009, the argument of this book is that the Stolen Generations is a myth.

Key elements of the story of the Stolen Generations are that children of Aboriginal descent were forcibly removed from their families and their culture. It is alleged that the children were removed as young as possible so that they could be raised to be ignorant of their culture and people and that the ultimate intent was to end the existence of the Aborigines as a distinct people. It was also alleged that, as a part of this policy, parents were deliberately prevented from maintaining contact with their children. Windschuttle cites the words of the principal historian of the Stolen Generations, Peter Read: &quot;Welfare officers, removing children solely because they were Aboriginal, intended and arranged that they should lose their Aboriginality, and that they never return home&quot;.

Windschuttle argues that his analysis of the records shows that Aboriginal children &quot;were never removed from their families in order to put an end to Aboriginality or, indeed, to serve any improper government policy or program&quot;. He argues that &quot;until the term stolen generations first appeared in 1981, there had been no popular tradition among Aboriginal people that employed either the term or the concept&quot;. In 1981, a &quot;then unknown white postgraduate history student, Peter Read&quot; wrote, &quot;in the course of just one day&quot;, a twenty-page pamphlet to make the case. &quot;He alone was granted the vision denied to all who came before him&quot;.

Windschuttle argues that Read&#x27;s &quot;version of events was deeply comforting&quot;. &quot;Mothers had not given their children away, fathers had not left their children destitute or deserted their families or been so consumed by alcohol they left them vulnerable to sexual predators&quot;... &quot;Aborigines could suddenly identify as morally innocent victims of a terrible injustice. Their problems could all be blamed on faceless white bureaucrats driven by racism. Since Read created this interpretation, it has come to be believed by most Aboriginal people in Australia.&quot;

With regard to the Human Rights Commission investigation into the Stolen Generations and their 1997 report entitled &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot;, he writes: &quot;The empirical underpinnings of &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; derived largely from the work of white academic historians. The Human Rights Commission did no serious research of its own into the primary historical sources. Co-authors Ronald Wilson and Mick Dodson also declined to hear any evidence that might have contradicted their preferred interpretation. They did not call witnesses from many of the still-living public officials responsible for child removal to hear or test their reasons for their policies and practices. The commission&#x27;s only original contribution was to solicit the testimony of 535 Aboriginal people who had been removed from their parents and who spoke about their own experiences. While many of these stories were completely believable in what they said about what happened and how they felt, it is nonetheless true that when these witnesses were children they were not in a position to comprehend the question at the centre of the accusation of genocide, the motives of government policy makers&quot;.

He argues that only a small number of children were actually removed (approximately 8,250 in the period 1880 to 1971), far less than the tens of thousands claimed, and that most of the removed children had been orphaned or were abandoned, destitute, neglected or subjected to various forms of exploitation and abuse. These removals were based on traditional grounds of child welfare. He argues that his analysis of welfare policy shows that none of the policies that allowed the removal of Aboriginal children were unique to Aborigines and that the evidence shows they were removed for the same child welfare reasons as white children who were in similar circumstances. &quot;A significant number of other children were voluntarily placed in institutions by Aboriginal parents to give them an education and a better chance in life&quot;.

Windschuttle states that, in Western Australia, the records indicate that the majority of the children who are claimed to have been removed and placed in state Aboriginal settlements, went to those settlements with their destitute parents.

Windschuttle argues that the evidence shows that the claims that parents were deliberately prevented from maintaining contact with their children and that the children were prevented from returning home are falsehoods. In New South Wales, for example, the relevant government board not only allowed parents to visit their children in the Aborigines Protection Board Children&#x27;s Homes, it provided them with train fare and a daily living allowance to enable them to do so. Windschuttle states that the records show that a majority of children removed in New South Wales returned either to their families or to their Aboriginal communities.

Windschuttle states that in New South Wales, Aboriginal children were placed in apprenticeships to enable them to acquire the skills to earn a living and be independent of welfare in a program that &quot;was a replica of measures that had already been applied to white children in welfare institutions in New South Wales for several decades, and to poor English children for several centuries before that&quot;. When Aboriginal children finished their apprenticeships they were free to go wherever they pleased including back to their original homes, permanently or for social visits.

With respect to the testing of the claims in court, Windschuttle writes: &quot;... when they tested specific policies before the Federal Court, and when they argued the general intentions of the parliaments and legislators before the High Court, the historians and political activists who invented the notion of the Stolen Generations proved incapable of substantiating their case. As far as Australia&#x27;s highest courts are concerned, the central hypothesis of the Stolen Generations is legally extinct&quot;... &quot;The only legal cases with any potential credibility would be those made by individuals such as Bruce Trevorrow, who was unlawfully removed from his family and suffered badly as a result&quot;. However in the Trevorrow case, Windschuttle argues that the decision shows &quot;that the actions of the Aborigines Protection Board in placing Bruce in foster care without his parents&#x27; agreement was actually illegal at the time&quot; and not the result of a policy of removal but rather the illegal actions of welfare officials who believed, rightly or wrongly, that Bruce Trevorrow was neglected and that his health and life would be in danger if they returned him to his mother. The fact that Bruce Trevorrow&#x27;s siblings were never removed is an indicator that there was no such policy and that welfare officials were not empowered to remove Aboriginal children on racial grounds.

==Future volumes==
In April 2010, Windschuttle announced that the two remaining books in the series, Volume Two on the Colonial Frontier from 1788 onwards, and Volume Four on the History Wars, originally projected for publication in 2003 and 2004, will be published at a date yet to be announced. In December 2013, Windschuttle advised that he hopes to have Volume Two published &quot;in time to take its place in the discussions about our past during the Anzac Centenary in April 2015&quot;.

As of November 2024, neither Volume 2 nor Volume 4 has appeared, and no revised publication schedule has been announced.

==2009 Quadrant hoax==
In January 2009, Windschuttle was hoaxed into publishing an article in &quot;Quadrant&quot;. The stated aim of the hoax was to expose Windschuttle&#x27;s purported right-wing bias by proving he would publish an inaccurate article and not check its footnotes or authenticity if it met his preconceptions. An author using the pseudonym &quot;biotechnologist Dr Sharon Gould&quot; submitted an article claiming that CSIRO had planned to produce food crops engineered with human genes. However, &quot;Gould&quot; revealed that she had regarded the article as an Alan Sokal style hoax, referring to an instance in which writings described as obvious scientific nonsense were submitted to and accepted by an academic journal. Based on the reporter&#x27;s intimate knowledge of the hoax and what he described as her &quot;triumphant&quot; tone when disclosing the hoax to him, Windschuttle accused the online publication &quot;Crikey&quot; of being involved in the hoax, a claim &quot;Crikey&quot; denied. Two days later, Crikey revealed that &quot;Gould&quot; was in fact the writer, editor and activist Katherine Wilson. Wilson agreed to being named by &quot;Crikey&quot;, as her name had already appeared in online speculation and it seemed likely that her identity was about to be revealed by other journalists.

Reporters Kelly Burke and Julie Robotham note that &quot;the projects cited by &#x27;Gould&#x27; as having been dumped by the organisation [CSIRO] are not in themselves implausible, and similar technologies are in active development. Human vaccines against diseases including hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus and Norwalk virus have been genetically engineered into crops as diverse as lettuce, potato and corn, and shown to provoke an immune response in humans.&quot; Gould also suggests the CSIRO abandoned research into the creation of dairy cattle capable of producing non-allergenic milk for lactose-intolerant infants and a genetically engineered mosquito that could stimulate antibodies against malaria in humans who were bitten, mitigating against (sic) the spread of the disease. Both ideas are under serious scientific study by research groups around the world.

The hoax elements of the article published in &quot;Quadrant&quot; were that the CSIRO had planned such research, that they had abandoned it because of perceived public moral or ethical objections and that evidence of this was &quot;buried&quot; in footnotes to an article in a scientific journal and in two annual reports of the CSIRO, the relevant report years being unspecified. Windschuttle states: &quot;A real hoax, like that of Alan Sokal and Ern Malley, is designed to expose editors who are pretentious, ignorant or at least over-enthusiastic about certain subjects. The technique is to submit obvious nonsense for publication in order to expose the editor&#x27;s ignorance of the topic. A real hoax defeats its purpose if it largely relies upon real issues, real people and real publications for its content. All of the latter is true of what &quot;Sharon Gould&quot; wrote. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of the content of her article is both factually true and well-based on the sources she cites.&quot;

==Campaign on Cardinal Pell case==
During the trial and imprisonment of Cardinal Pell in 2019–20 on charges of sexual abuse of a minor, Windschuttle led a campaign in &quot;Quadrant&quot; defending Pell&#x27;s innocence. After Pell&#x27;s acquittal by the High Court of Australia, Windschuttle published a book, &quot;The Persecution of George Pell&quot;, arguing that Pell had faced a concerted campaign by Victorian police, judiciary and victims&#x27; advocates to convict him on flimsy evidence.

<text>Barbara Kay Roberts (née Hughey; born December 21, 1936) is an American politician from the state of Oregon. A native of the state, she served as the 34th Governor of Oregon from 1991 to 1995. She was the first woman elected to serve as Oregon governor, and the only woman elected to that office until 2016. A Democrat, Roberts was also the first woman to serve as majority leader in the Oregon House of Representatives. She also won two terms as Oregon Secretary of State, and served in local and county government in Portland. Roberts was married to Oregon state Sen. Frank L. Roberts from 1974 until his death in 1993. From February 2011 until January 2013, she served on the council of Metro, the regional government in the Portland metropolitan area.

==Early life==
Roberts was born Barbara Kay Hughey on December 21, 1936, in Corvallis, Oregon, to Bob and Carmen Murray Hughey. Her father, a millworker, was a descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers. The Hugheys&#x27; second daughter Pat was born a few years later and then they moved to Los Angeles, California in 1940 where her father worked as a machinist. Following World War II, the Hugheys returned to Oregon, settling in Gold Creek in Yamhill County in 1945, and then finally in Sheridan.

In 1954, she married her high-school sweetheart Neal Sanders, graduating the following year from Sheridan High School. The couple moved to Texas, where they had two children, Mike and Mark, before returning to Oregon several years later, settling in Portland where she attended Portland State University from 1961 to 1964.

With her older son, Mike, diagnosed in 1962 as &quot;severely emotionally disturbed&quot; (later identified as autism), she became an advocate for special-needs children. In 1971, she successfully lobbied the Oregon State Legislature to require public schools to guarantee educational rights to these children. In 1972, her marriage to Neal ended in divorce.

==Political career==
In 1973, she was elected to Parkrose School Board and, later, to the Mount Hood Community College board. In 1974, she married Oregon state representative and later state senator Frank L. Roberts, who became her political mentor. In 1980, she was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat, was re-elected in 1982. Her Democratic colleagues chose her as House Majority Leader, Oregon&#x27;s first woman to hold that post.

===Secretary of State===
In 1984, Roberts was elected as Oregon Secretary of State, the first Democrat elected to that post in over 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. Her significant achievements as Secretary of State include election-reform legislation, the construction of a new state archives building, and broader audit powers for the Secretary of State. The Portland Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus sang at her inauguration. It is widely believed that this was the first time that a gay-identified chorus sang for the inauguration of a statewide elected official of any state. During her second term, Roberts attended an executive program at the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University.

===Governor===
Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt announced that he would not seek a second term as governor in 1990. Roberts, halfway through her second term as secretary of state, announced she would run for governor. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and went on to defeat Republican Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer and Independent Al Mobley in the November general election.

Roberts became the first woman elected Governor of Oregon.

During that same election, voters passed Ballot Measure 5, which established constitutional limits on property-tax rates.

During her term as governor, Roberts worked with the Clinton administration to secure federal waivers and funding for the Oregon Health Plan. She also helped to increase the number of children in the Head Start Program, secured financing for additional units of affordable housing, and developed programs to help move Oregonians from welfare to the workplace. The Roberts administration was known for its strong support of gay rights and appointed women to positions in state government.

Her husband, Frank L. Roberts, died in 1993 from prostate cancer while she was still governor. After his death, Barbara Roberts wrote the book &quot;Death Without Denial Grief Without Apology: A Guide for Facing Death and Loss&quot;.

There were several factors that were responsible for Roberts&#x27; decision not to seek re-election in 1994. The leading cause was to process the loss of her husband.

==Later life and family==
Soon after she left office, Roberts accepted a position at the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University as director of the Harvard Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government and later as a senior fellow to the Women and Public Policy Program. In 1998, Roberts joined Portland State University&#x27;s Hatfield School of Government&#x27;s Executive Leadership Institute as Associate Director of Leadership Development.

Roberts has continued her community service, sitting on the board of trustees for several major nonprofit organizations, including the Oregon Hospice Association, the Human Rights Campaign, and the advisory council of Oregon&#x27;s Compassion in Dying. She has also maintained an active public speaking career, addressing issues of death and grieving, leadership, women in politics, and environmental stewardship. Roberts has two sons, Mike and Mark Sanders, and two grandchildren, Robert M. Sanders and Kaitlin Sanders.

Roberts High School in Salem, Oregon, was named after her in 1996.

==Return to government service==
In early 2011, Roberts returned to government service, as a member of the six-person Metro council, the Portland metropolitan area&#x27;s elected regional government, after Robert Liberty resigned in January from his position as councillor representing Metro district 6. Roberts was appointed to the council in February to fill the remainder (about 22 months) of Liberty&#x27;s four-year term, by a vote of the council. Although Metro council positions are publicly elected offices, an election is not required when filling a council vacancy in mid-term. She was sworn in on February 24, 2011. Metro district 6 includes portions of Northeast, Southeast and Southwest Portland. She indicated that she would not be a candidate for the position when it next came due for election, in May 2012, and Bob Stacey was elected to the district 6 seat at that time. Roberts&#x27; council term ended, and Stacey succeeded her, in January 2013.

<text>Luis Enrique Ugueto [oo-geh-to] (born February 15, 1979) is a former Major League Baseball second baseman and switch-hitter who played for the Seattle Mariners in 2002 and 2003.

Originally signed by the Florida Marlins as an amateur free agent in 1996, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates from Florida in the 2001 Rule 5 draft, and was traded to the Mariners for cash the same day. Finally, he made his debut with the Mariners on April 3, 2002.

Ugueto was a promising young infielder with a strong arm and blistering speed on the bases. What Seattle hoped would develop was his bat and his overall feel for the game, especially defensively, at the major league level. In two seasons as a backup with the Mariners, Ugueto batted .214 with one home run and two RBI in 74 games.

Ugueto signed with the Kansas City Royals prior to the 2005 season and spent the season with the Royals&#x27; top minor league club, the Omaha Royals. While with Omaha, he was suspended twice for violating baseball&#x27;s steroid policy, and he was released by the Royals after the second violation.

After missing the entire 2006 season, Ugueto played with the Minnesota Twins minor league team, the Fort Myers Miracle during the 2007 season. In 2008, he played in Italy&#x27;s Serie A1 for the Caffè Danesi Nettuno and hit .289. He also shortly played for the Laredo Broncos.

<doc id="708651" wikidata="Q321574" url="?curid=708651" title="Dom Moraes">
<text>Dominic Francis &quot;Dom&quot; Moraes (19 July 1938 – 2 June 2004) was a British writer and poet who published nearly 30 books in English. He is widely seen as a foundational figure in Indian English literature. His poems are a meaningful and substantial contribution to Indian and World literature.

==Early life==
Dom Moraes was born in Bombay, British India to Beryl and Frank Moraes, former editor of &quot;The Times of India&quot; and later &quot;The Indian Express&quot;. He had a tormented relationship with his mother Beryl, who had been confined to a mental asylum since his childhood. His aunt was the historian Teresa Albuquerque. He attended the city&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s School, and then left for England to enroll at Jesus College, Oxford.

Moraes spent eight years in Britain (in London and Oxford), New York City, Hong Kong, Delhi and Bombay.

==Career==
David Archer published Moraes&#x27; first collection of poems, &quot;A Beginning&quot;, in 1957. When he was 19, still an undergraduate, he became the first Indian to win the Hawthornden Prize and was presented with £100 and a silver medal by Lord David Cecil at the Arts Council of Britain on 10 July 1958.

He edited magazines in London, Hong Kong and New York. He became the editor of &quot;The Asia Magazine&quot; in 1971. He scripted and partially directed over 20 television documentaries for the BBC and ITV. He was a war correspondent in Algeria, Israel and Vietnam. In 1976 he joined the United Nations.

Moraes conducted one of the first interviews of the Dalai Lama after the Tibetan spiritual leader fled to India in 1959. The Dalai Lama was then 23 and Moraes, 20.

==Later life and death==
In 1961–62 he was one of the very few public Indian figures to strongly criticize the Indian Army takeover of Goa, land of his forefathers – Daman and Diu from Portuguese India. He tore up his Indian passport on TV in protest. He was later allowed back in the country.

When the Gujarat riots erupted in 2002, with their heavy toll of Muslim dead, Moraes left for Ahmedabad the minute the news came through, saying that since he was a Catholic, Muslims would not see him as an enemy. Even though he was physically in considerable pain by then, he was one of the first on the scene.

Moraes ended his writing career, writing books in collaboration with Sarayu Srivatsa.

He had a lifelong battle with alcoholism. Moraes suffered from cancer, but refused treatment and died from a heart attack in Bandra, Mumbai. He was buried in the city&#x27;s Sewri Cemetery. Many of Dom&#x27;s old friends and publishers attended the memorial service in Odcombe. A headstone in yellow Jaisalmer stone lies embedded in the front lawn of the Church of St Peter and St Paul to mark the service.

==Personal life==
In 1956, aged 18, he was courted by Audrey Wendy Abbott who later changed her name to Henrietta. They married in 1961. He left her, according to his close friends in London, but did not divorce her. He had a son, Francis Moraes, with his second wife Judith, whom he divorced, and returned to India in 1968. In 1969, he married the Indian actress Leela Naidu. They were treated as a star couple, and known across the world for over two decades. Their marriage ended in a separation. For the last 13 years of his life he lived with Sarayu Srivatsa, with whom he co-authored two books.

==History==

Ratnagiri, located along the Konkan coast of Maharashtra, has a rich and diverse history that dates back centuries. It served as the administrative capital under the Sultanate of Bijapur, with its strategic location making it an important military and trade center. The Ratnadurg Fort, originally built by the Bijapur Sultanate, was reconstructed by Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1670, turning it into a key coastal defense post.

In 1731, Ratnagiri came under the control of the Kingdom of Satara, marking the beginning of its integration into the Maratha Empire. Following the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the British annexed Ratnagiri to British India in 1818, further embedding it into the colonial structure.

Ratnagiri holds significant cultural importance as the birthplace of Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, born on 23 July 1856. Tilak, an influential leader in India’s struggle for independence, moved to Pune with his family at the age of 10. His early years in Ratnagiri influenced his later revolutionary thoughts.

The city was also a place of exile for King Thibaw of Burma after the British Empire annexed his country. In 1886, King Thibaw, along with his family, was exiled to Ratnagiri, where he lived the rest of his life under British surveillance. His residence, the Thibaw Palace, still stands as a symbol of this chapter in the city’s history.

Furthermore, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a key figure in India’s independence movement, was confined in Ratnagiri from 1921 to 1935, first in prison and then under local confinement. His time in Ratnagiri played a pivotal role in shaping his revolutionary ideologies.

Today, Ratnagiri is known not only for its historical significance but also for its agricultural contributions, especially the famous Alphonso mangoes, and its growing role as a cultural and educational hub in Maharashtra.

<doc id="708656" wikidata="Q188608" url="?curid=708656" title="Iranian rial">
<text>The rial (; abbreviation: Rl (singular) and Rls (plural) or IR in Latin; ISO code: IRR) is the official currency of Iran. It is subdivided into 100 dinars, but due to the rial&#x27;s low purchasing power the dinar is not practically used. While POS terminals are in use in Iran, the country does not participate in any of the major international card networks due to sanctions between it and the United States. Travelers are instead advised to load money onto a local prepaid card account.

There is no official symbol for the currency but the Iranian standard ISIRI 820 defined a symbol for use on typewriters (mentioning that it is an invention of the standards committee itself) and the two Iranian standards ISIRI 2900 and ISIRI 3342 define a character code to be used for it. The Unicode Standard has a compatibility character defined .

A proposal has been agreed to by the Iranian Parliament to drop one zero at the end of number, by replacing the rial with a new currency called the toman, the name of a previous Iranian currency, at the rate of 1 toman = 10,000 rials.

As of 2024, the Iranian rial is the world’s least valuable currency, worth less than the Sierra Leonean leone or the Laotian Kip.

==History==
The rial was first introduced in 1798 as a coin worth 1,250 dinars or one-eighth of a &quot;toman&quot;. In 1825, the rial ceased to be issued, with the qiran subdivided into 20 shahi or 1,000 dinars and was worth one-tenth of a toman, being issued as part of a decimal system. The rial replaced the qiran at par in 1932, subdivided into 100 new dinars.

Prior to decimalisation in 1932, these coins and currencies were used, and some of these terms still have wide usage in Iranian languages and proverbs:

==Value==

In 1932, the rial was pegged to sterling at a rate of £1 = Rls 59.75. The exchange rate was £1 = Rls 80.25 in 1936, £1 = Rls 64.350 in 1939, £1 = Rls 68.8 in 1940, £1 = Rls 141 in 1941 and £1 = Rls 129 in 1942. In 1945, the rial was pegged to the U.S. dollar at USD 1 = Rls 32.25. The rate was US$1 = Rls 75.75 in 1957. Iran did not follow the dollar&#x27;s currency devaluation in 1973, leading to a new peg of USD 1 = Rls 68.725. The dollar peg was dropped in 1975.

In 1979, Rls 70 equalled USD 1. The value of the rial declined precipitously after the Islamic Revolution because of capital flight from the country. Studies estimate that the flight of capital from Iran shortly before and after the revolution in the range of $30 to $40 billion. Whereas on March 15, 1978, Rls 71.46 equalled $1, in July 1999, $1 equalled Rls 9,430.

Injecting sudden foreign exchange revenues in the economic system forms the phenomenon of &quot;Dutch disease&quot; in a country. There are two main consequences for a country with Dutch disease: loss of price competitiveness in its production goods, and hence the exports of those goods; and an increase in imports. Both cases are clearly visible in Iran.

Although described as an (interbank) &quot;market rate&quot;, the value of the Iranian rial is tightly controlled by the central bank. The state ownership of oil export earnings and its large reserves, supervision of letters of credit, together with current – and capital outflow account – outflows allows management of demand. The central bank has allowed the rial to weaken in nominal terms (4.6% on average in 2009) in order to support the competitiveness of non-oil exports.

There is an active black market in foreign exchange, but the development of the TSE rate and the ready availability of foreign exchange during 2000 narrowed the differential to as little as IR100 in mid-2000. However, the spread increased again in September 2010 because channels for transferring foreign currency to and from Iran being blocked because of international sanctions.

Monetary policy is facilitated by a network of 50 Iranian-run forex dealers in Iran, the rest of the Middle East and Europe. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and dealers, the Iranian government was selling US$250 million daily to keep the rial exchange rate against the US dollar between Rls 9,700 and Rls 9,900 in 2009. At times (before the devaluation of the rial in 2013) the authorities weakened the national currency intentionally by withholding the supply of hard currency to earn more rial-denominated income, usually at times when the government faced a budget deficit.

The widening of the gap between official and unofficial exchange rates stood at over 20% in November 2011. This shows the correlation between the value of foreign currencies and the domestic inflationary environment.

The unofficial rial to US dollar rate underwent severe fluctuations in January 2012 (the rial losing 50% of its value in a few days, following new international sanctions against the CBI), eventually settling at Rls 17,000 at the end of the period. Besides all the bad effects on the economy in general, this had the effect of boosting the competitiveness of Iran&#x27;s domestic industries abroad. Following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s decision to liberalize the mechanism by which bank interest rates are set (granting banks the authority to raise interest rates to 21%), CBI announced that it would be fixing the official rate of the rial against the dollar at Rls 12,260 from January 28, 2012, and seek to meet all demand for foreign currency through banks.

As of June 2020, the Iranian rial has fallen almost five-fold since the beginning of 2018 and contributing to the record inflation. Reason cited by analysts is the fact that the government has been printing money in excess of the economic growth.

The Rial&#x27;s value has dropped by 29% since the nationwide protests that began on September 16, 2022, following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year old Kurdish-Iranian woman in police custody. Following the regional tension towards the end of 2024, the fall of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime in Syria, Donald Trump winning the US election and ongoing economic factors have brought the Rial to its lowest value at the end of 2024, 820,500 to the dollar.

&quot;Pre-unification, rials per US dollar:&quot;
*&quot;Market&quot;: 8,200 (2002); 8,050 (2001); 8,350 (2000)
*&quot;Preferred&quot;: 6,906 (2002); 1,753 (2001); 1,764 (2000)

=== Current market exchange rates ===

===Exchange rate system===
Until 2002, Iran&#x27;s exchange rate system was based on a multi-layered system, where state and para-state enterprises benefited from the &quot;preferred or official rate&quot; (Rls 1,750 for US$1) while the private sector paid the &quot;market rate&quot; (Rls 8,000 for US$1), hence creating an unequal competition environment. The &quot;official rate&quot; applied to oil and gas export receipts, imports of essential goods and services, and repayment of external debt. The &quot;export rate&quot;, fixed at Rls 3,000 per dollar since May 1995, applied to all other trade transactions, but mainly to capital goods imports of public enterprises.

In 1998, in order to ease pressure on exporters, the central bank introduced a currency certificate system allowing exporters to trade certificates for hard currency on the Tehran Stock Exchange, thus creating a floating value for the rial known as the &quot;TSE rate&quot; or &quot;market rate&quot;. This method finally replaced the fixed &quot;export rate&quot; (Rls 3,000:US$1) in March 2000, and has since held steady at some Rls 8,500:US$1.

In March 2002, the multi-tiered system was replaced by a unified, market-driven exchange rate. In 2002 the &quot;official rate&quot; a/k/a &quot;preferred rate&quot; (Rls 1,752:US$1) was abolished, and the TSE rate became the basis for the new unified foreign-exchange regime. Iran&#x27;s Central Bank channels more than 90 per cent of hard currency into the local market (2012).

====Forex bourse====

In a move interpreted as aiming at unifying currency exchange rates, on September 24, 2012, the government launched a foreign exchange centre, that would provide importers of some basic goods with foreign exchanges, at a rate about 2% cheaper than the open market rate on a given day. This project was cancelled following the strong depreciation of the rial between 2012 and 2013 but was put on the agenda again in 2015 for use in the reunification of forex rates (planned for 2017) and the introduction of currency derivatives. through the Iran Mercantile Exchange.

In addition to banks, &quot;exchange shops&quot; are also available for limited transactions. Exchange shops must operate under the licenses issued by Central Bank of Iran. Foreign currencies can be bought or sold at these exchange shops.

====Exchange restriction====
Exchange restriction arises from limitations on the transferability of rial profits
from certain investments under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act and from limitations on other investment-related current international payments under this act.

====Multiple currency practices====
In 2010, the cases of multiple currency practices arose from the following:
#Budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002, under the previous multiple exchange rate system (see above);
#Obligations of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange at subsidized &quot;allocated rates&quot; under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused allocations to the Central Bank of Iran at the allocation rate.

Until 2012, the dollar had different exchange rates, depending on where you are buying your currency

*Official exchange rate
*Free trade zone exchange rate
*Referential exchange rate
*Black market exchange rate

In 2012, Bank Markazi classified a long list of goods into categories with priorities 1 through 10, leaving it to the parallel market to take of all other needs. Priorities 1 and 2 are food and medicine, receiving foreign exchange at the official rate of Rls 12,260 per dollar, followed by other categories with lower priorities, which are mostly intermediate goods used in industrial production.

====Redenomination====
Because of the current low value of rial, and that people rarely use the term, redenomination or change of currency has been proposed a number of times since the late 1980s. The issue has re-emerged and been under discussion, as a result of issuance of larger banknotes in 2003. Opponents of redenomination are wary of more inflation resulting from psychological effects, and increase in velocity of money leading to more instabilities in the economy of Iran.

On April 12, 2007, the Economics Commission of the Parliament announced initiation of a statute in draft to change the currency, claiming redenominations had helped reduce inflation elsewhere, such as in Turkey. In 2008, an official at the Central Bank of Iran said the bank plans to slash four zeros off the rial and rename it the toman. The bank printed two new traveller&#x27;s cheques, which function quite similar to a banknote, with values of Rls 500,000 and Rls 1,000,000. However, they have the figures &quot;50&quot; (should read 50 thousand toman) and &quot;100&quot; (should read 100 thousand toman) written on their top right hand corners, respectively, which is seen as the first step toward a new currency.

In 2010, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran would remove three zeros (not the four that had been proposed) from its national currency as part of the economic reform plan.

In April 2011, it was reported that the Central Bank is working on a six-month redenomination project to cut four zeros from the national currency and replace old bank notes with new ones, similar to the revaluation of the Turkish lira in 2005.

A website to poll the public on the redenomination plan was launched July 21, 2011; the public was allowed to vote on how many zeroes to cut and what the new currency&#x27;s name should be. Preliminary results indicate that four zeroes would be cut (in line with the government&#x27;s recommendation) and that the name will be changed to Parsi.

In 2016, the government announced its plan to end the official status of the rial, replacing it with the commonly used unit the &quot;toman&quot; (which represents 10 rials).

In July 2019, the Iranian government approved a bill to change the national currency from the rial to the toman with one toman equalling Rls 10,000, a process which will reportedly cost $160 million. This proposal was approved by the Iranian parliament in May 2020. The changeover is likely to be phased over a period of up to two years.

===CIA market manipulation===
It was reported in 2007 that a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plan had been authorized to manipulate the Iranian rial in order to destabilize the country, though the details and outcome of said plan are not known. Iran reported arresting 20 &quot;Forex manipulators&quot; in 2012.

==Coins==
===Classical rial===

During the late 18th and early 19th century, silver coins were issued in denominations of , , and 1 rial.

===Modern rial===
The first coins of the second rial currency, introduced in 1932, were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 25 dinars, Rl , Rl 1, Rls 2 and Rls 5, with the Rls  to Rls 5 coins minted in silver. Gold coins denominated in &quot;pahlavi&quot; were also issued, initially valued at Rls 100. In 1944, the silver coinage was reduced in size, with the smallest silver coins being the Rls 1 pieces. Minting of all denominations below 25 dinars ended in this year. In 1945, silver Rls 10 coins were introduced. In 1953, silver coins ceased to be minted, with the smallest denomination now 50 dinars. Rls 20 coins were introduced in 1972.

After the Islamic Revolution, the coinage designs were changed to remove the Shah&#x27;s effigy but the sizes and compositions were not immediately changed. 50 dinar coins were only minted in 1979 and Rls 50 coins were introduced in 1980. In 1992, a new coinage was introduced with smaller Rls 1, Rls 5, Rls 10 and Rls 50 coins and new Rls 100 pieces. Rls 250 coins were introduced the following year. In 2004, the sizes of the Rls 50, Rls 100 and Rls 250 coins were reduced and Rls 500 coins were introduced. New, smaller types of Rls 250 and Rls 500 were introduced in 2009, along with the new denomination of Rls 1,000. Rls 2,000 and Rls 5,000 rial coins in 2010.

===Digital Rial===
Digital Rial or Iran&#x27;s National Currency is a type of currency that according to the announcement of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Its release is based on the Modern Rial.

====Current series====

==Banknotes==
In 1932, notes were issued by the &quot;Bank Melli Iran&quot; in denominations of Rls 5, Rls 10, Rls 20, Rls 50, Rls 100 and Rls 500. Rls 1,000 notes were introduced in 1935, followed by Rls 200 notes in 1951 and Rls 5,000 and Rls 10,000 in 1952. Rls 5 notes were last issued in the 1940s, with Rls 10 notes disappearing in the 1960s. In 1961, the Central Bank of Iran took over the issuance of paper money.

In 1979, after the Islamic revolution, Iranian banknotes featuring the Shah&#x27;s face were counter-stamped with intricate designs to cover the Shah&#x27;s face. The first regular issues of the Islamic Republic were in denominations of Rls 100, Rls 200, Rls 500, Rls 1,000, Rls 5,000 and Rls 10,000. Rls 2,000 notes were introduced in 1986.

They are issued by the Central Bank of Iran, each bearing the signature of the President of the Iranian Central Bank. The Rls 100, Rls 200 and Rls 500 banknotes are becoming increasingly uncommon; shopkeepers habitually give out small packages of gum in lieu of the last Rls 500 of change. For day to day means people will carry wads of Rls 100,000 notes.

=== Qajar Series (1850–1925) ===

=== Revolution Series (1981–2005) ===
=== Ruhollah Khomeini Series (1992–2019) ===
=== Intergenerational series (2019–2023) ===
In preparation for an upcoming redenomination whereby Rls 10,000 will become one toman, notes of this series display the numerical value in tomans as well as rials (the latter with the trailing four zeros de-emphasized). Due to a shortage of paper currency, higher denominations have been issued as cheques rather than legal tender banknotes.

;2019
*Rls 500,000 (50 tomans) cheque 

;2020
*Rls 100,000 (10 tomans) 
*Rls 1,000,000 (100 tomans) cheque

*Rls 20,000 (2 tomans)
*Rls 50,000 (5 tomans) 

;2023

===Issuance of larger notes===
Printing banknotes larger than Rls 10,000 was first proposed in 1989, and in 1992 the central bank asked for government permission to print Rls 20,000, Rls 50,000 and Rls 100,000 notes. This was not realized at that time, due to fears of inflation and counterfeiting. The Rls 10,000 note remained the highest valued banknote for more than 50 years until 2005, when a Rls 20,000 banknote was introduced and subsequently a Rls 50,000 banknote was introduced with the subject being the Iranian nuclear energy program. The note was issued March 12. The note features a quote by the prophet Mohammed, translated as: &quot;Even if knowledge is at the Pleiades, the people from the land of Persia would attain it&quot;.
Banknotes currently in circulation are Rls 100, Rls 200, Rls 500, Rls 1,000, Rls 2,000, Rls 5,000, Rls 10,000, Rls 20,000, Rls 50,000 and Rls 100,000. After the death of Ruhollah Khomeini, his portrait was used on the obverse of Rls 1,000 banknotes and greater.

===Cash cheques===

Currently the highest valued legal tender banknote issued by the central bank is Rls 100,000 (about US$2.4 on Aug. 22, 2023). However Rls 500,000 and Rls 1,000,000 Iran Cheques circulate freely and are treated as cash.

The central bank used to allow major state banks to print their own banknotes known as &quot;cash cheques&quot;. They were a form of bearer teller&#x27;s-cheque with fixed amounts, printed in the form of official banknotes. Once they were acquired from banks, they could function like cash for a year. Two forms of these banknotes were available. One known as &quot;Iran cheque&quot; could be cashed in any financial institution, while the other could be cashed at the issuing bank. They were printed in denominations of Rls 200,000, Rls 500,000, Rls 1,000,000, Rls 2,000,000 and Rls 5,000,000.

In 2008, CBI revoked this privilege from banks, and currently issues its own Iran Cheques in denominations of Rls 500,000, Rls 1,000,000, and Rls 2,000,000.

==Printing==

Security Paper Mill (called TAKAB) is a paper mill and a subsidiary of the Central Bank of Iran responsible for production of security papers, including those of the Iranian rial banknotes located in the city of Amol.

<text>Chip Tsao (born 17 August 1958), also known by his Chinese language pen name To Kit, is a multilingual Hong Kong–based columnist, broadcaster, and writer. His writings are mostly in Chinese. He is well known for his sarcasm and wry sense of humour.

==Family and education==

Tsao&#x27;s family traces their roots back to Guangxi. His father was the vice chief editor of &quot;Ta Kung Pao,&quot; a leftwing newspaper in Hong Kong, whilst his mother was also an editor of the same paper. His maternal grandfather was a journalist of the &quot;Pearl River Daily&quot;. He was raised in Hong Kong&#x27;s Wanchai district, and began reading early in his life. Tsao attended Pui Kiu Middle School and later Lingnan Secondary School in Hong Kong. During this time, his writing was once published in &quot;The New Evening Post&quot;. In 1983, he was awarded a BA in English and European Literature from the University of Warwick. Then he completed a Postgraduate Diploma in International Relations from the London School of Economics. He states that he never thought about becoming a writer in his youth, however, and that his parents discouraged him from this career because they felt it would be dangerous.

Tsao is married and has two children.

==Career==
Tsao began his journalism career in the United Kingdom as a reporter for the BBC and Radio Television Hong Kong. Then, famous writer Jin Yong (Louis Cha) invited him to write a regular column for &quot;Ming Pao&quot; about his experiences living abroad. It was at this time that he began to use his pen name To Kit. The name of his column in Ming Pao,&quot;&#x27;The Golden Venture&quot;, derives from the name of a vessel that took Chinese illegal immigrants to the United States in 1993. His first book, &quot;Alongside Thames&quot;, was published in 1995.

Tsao later he joined a team of broadcasters to host a weekly current affairs programme on RTHK named &#x27;Free as Wind&#x27; (). In September 2003, he switched to the Commercial Radio Hong Kong to host a similar daily radio entitled &#x27;Summit&#x27; (, literally &#x27;the Peak of Light&#x27;).

Tsao currently writes for Apple Daily and HK Magazine. Pieces from his columns, such as  Come On, James, have gone viral and become an internet sensation in several new forms of adaptations.

Tsao is not without his controversies. His status as a premier writer of Hong Kong is often challenged, one example being a piece by Rosetta Lui and Perry Lam in the December 2007 issue of &quot;Muse&quot;: &quot;Some 15 or 20 years from now, the books of Chip Tsao... if they are talked about at all, will most probably be used as anecdotal evidence to illustrate how dumbed-down our city&#x27;s culture has become since the 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. His essays are always funny, sometimes lyrical but almost never ruminative.&quot;

==Political viewpoints==

===Hong Kong politics===
Tsao first began writing about Hong Kong public affairs in a column for English-language newspaper &quot;Eastern Express&quot;. He is often perceived as pro-British, and has been accused of looking down on China. But in a South China Morning Post interview in 2008, Tsao explained his position on China and denied that he was an anglophile, saying: &quot;I am critical of modern China but if people think criticising makes you a traitor, that’s their problem. Some people say I’m an Anglophile but I don’t consider myself one. I just admire beautiful things and good values, and that includes Tibetan culture. There are bad things about the Brits too – they can be hypocrites and racists.&quot;

===Accusations of racism===
Tsao has faced various accusations of racism for his English-language writings. In October 2005, an article he wrote for the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; entitled &quot;Have Hong Kong girls stopped looking for Mr White?&quot; sparked accusations that he promoted discrimination and was jealous of white men in Hong Kong. Tsao responded that he was merely being sarcastic and provocative, repeating themes which were often discussed in Chinese media, and accused his critics themselves of being racist and lacking the ability to &quot;read between the lines&quot;.

On 27 March 2009, an article of Tsao&#x27;s entitled &quot;The War at Home&quot; was published in the free &quot;HK Magazine&quot;. In it, he wrote that the Philippines was unworthy of claiming the Spratly Islands from China because &quot;as a nation of servants, you don&#x27;t flex your muscles at your master, from whom you earn most of your bread and butter.&quot; Many Filipinos decried his article as racist, discriminatory, and demeaning, and the Philippine government declared him an &quot;undesirable alien&quot; as a result. His writings provoked negative reactions from various Philippine legislators; Senator Pia Cayetano stated that &quot;instead of contributing to intelligent discussions on ways to resolve the Spratlys dispute, Tsao only succeeded in eliciting hatred and sowing more confusion not only among Filipinos but maybe even among his fellow Chinese who are not aware of the intricacies of the issue&quot;, while Parañaque Congressman Roilo Golez refused to accept Tsao&#x27;s apology for his article, and challenged him to a boxing match. On 30 March 2009, HK Magazine issued an apology for the offence Tsao&#x27;s article had caused. The following day, Tsao subsequently admitted his wrongdoing and apologised to the Philippine government and its people in an interview aired over Hong Kong’s ATV. He said, &quot;I realized that I had crossed the line. I now offer my public apology.&quot; He has also indicated, however, that the article was meant as satire, and that it &quot;was never intended to be insulting to the Filipino domestic workers.&quot;

===Criticism of #MeToo===
In 2017, Tsao posted on Facebook mocking the Me Too movement one day after the revelation from Hong Kong athlete Lui Lai Yiu that she was sexually assaulted by a former coach. Tsao wrote that he was touched on the face without his consent by a female teacher when he was in kindergarten and now he realised that he was &quot;one of the victims of low-end sex abuse&quot;. &quot;Thanks to the Facebook generation, by simply attaching a selfie, anyone can become a Harvey Weinstein or a Kevin Spacey,&quot; he added. Some praised him for his &quot;good sense of humour&quot; and recognizing that any man could be open to accusations over past inappropriate behaviour of which they may or may not be guilty. More including the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women criticised him for inappropriate analogy and ignorance on sexual violence.

==Works==
Tsao&#x27;s work, both on radio and in his columns, concentrates on the following subjects:
*Changes in governance of Hong Kong prior to and following the transfer of sovereignty to China
*The essence of classical Chinese and Western civilisation
*Difference between Chinese and Westerners (particular in terms of politics and lifestyle)
*The &#x27;peasant mentality&#x27; of the Chinese
*Films A new film called &quot;ENTHRALLED&quot; released on 10 April 2014 in Hong Kong which portrays post-handover Hong Kong through the love story of a group of returnees. 
*Prominent women (he wrote a column on the achievements of well-known Chinese women in &quot;Ming Pao Monthly&quot; between 1998 and 2003)

<text>Ratnagiri district (Marathi pronunciation: ) is a district in the state of Maharashtra, India. The administrative headquarter of the district is located in the town of Ratnagiri. The district is 11.34% urban. The district is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west, Sindhudurg district to the south, Raigad district to the north and Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts to the east. This district is part of Konkan division.

==History==
From pre-Christian times until 1312, the area – like the entire region – was ruled by various Buddhist and Hindu rulers. The first state known by name was the Mauryan Empire, the last non-Muslim dynasty were the Yadavas of Devagiri. After decades of military clashes with Muslim rulers in northern India, the region was occupied by Muslim armies between 1312 and 1470. From 1500 on there was fierce fighting for rule on the coast between the Muslim rulers and the Portuguese. After that, various Muslim dynasties ruled until 1658 (Sultanate of Delhi, Bahmani, Deccan Sultanates and the Mughals). From 1658, most of the area became part of the Maratha Empire. After the defeat of the Marathas against the British in 1818, Ratnagiri area became an administrative region of the Bombay Presidency. With the independence of India in 1947 and the reorganization of the country, it became part of the new Bombay State in 1950. In 1948 the district grew through the incorporation of the Sawantwadi princely state. In 1960, Bombay State was divided and the area became part of the newly created state of Maharashtra. In 1981 the district was divided and the southern part of the district became Sindhudurg district.

<doc id="708662" wikidata="Q2632776" url="?curid=708662" title="Gluten-free diet">
<text>A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a nutritional plan that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of prolamin proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.

Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), and wheat allergy. In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten. People with a poor understanding of a gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.

In addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or HIV enteropathy, among others. There is no good evidence that gluten-free diets are an alternative medical treatment for people with autism.

Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not as enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.

A gluten-free diet may be based on gluten-free foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn. Gluten-free processed foods may be used. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals have been found to be suitable alternative choices that can provide adequate nutrition.

==Rationale behind adoption of the diet==
===Coeliac disease===
Coeliac disease (American English: celiac) (CD) is a chronic, immune-mediated, and mainly intestinal process, that appears in genetically predisposed people of all ages. It is caused by the ingestion of gluten, which is present in wheat, barley, rye and derivatives. Coeliac disease is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may affect several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may often be completely asymptomatic. Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers (anti-tissue transglutaminase [TG2]) are not always present, and many people with coeliac may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the intestinal villi.

Coeliac disease affects approximately 1–2% of the general population all over the world and is on the increase, but most cases remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, exposing patients to the risk of long-term complications. People may develop severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years before a proper diagnosis is achieved. Untreated coeliac disease may cause malabsorption, reduced quality of life, iron deficiency, osteoporosis, obstetric complications (stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for gestational age), an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas and greater mortality. Coeliac disease is associated with some autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroiditis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.

Coeliac disease with &quot;classic symptoms&quot;, which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and impaired growth, is currently the least common presentation of the disease and affects predominantly small children generally younger than two years of age.

Coeliac disease with &quot;non-classic symptoms&quot; is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children (over two years old), adolescents and adults. It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic both in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults.

Following a lifelong gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for people with coeliac disease.

===Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity===

Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a gluten-free diet, after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are excluded. People with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, which resemble those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms.

Gastrointestinal symptoms may include any of the following: abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), nausea, aerophagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aphthous stomatitis. A range of extra-intestinal symptoms, said to be the only manifestation of NCGS in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, have been suggested, but remain controversial. These include: headache, migraine, &quot;brain fog&quot;, fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, tingling of the extremities, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), atopic disorders such as asthma, rhinitis, other allergies, depression, anxiety, iron-deficiency anemia, folate deficiency or autoimmune diseases. NCGS has also been controversially implicated in some neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, eating disorders, autism, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Above 20% of people with NCGS have IgE-mediated allergy to one or more inhalants, foods or metals, among which most common are mites, graminaceae, parietaria, cat or dog hair, shellfish and nickel. Approximately, 35% of people with NCGS have other food intolerances, mainly lactose intolerance.

The pathogenesis of NCGS is not yet well understood. For this reason, it is a controversial syndrome and some authors still question it. There is evidence that not only gliadin (the main cytotoxic antigen of gluten), but also other proteins named ATIs which are present in gluten-containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley, and their derivatives) may have a role in the development of symptoms. ATIs are potent activators of the innate immune system. FODMAPs, especially fructans, are present in small amounts in gluten-containing grains and have been identified as a possible cause of some gastrointestinal symptoms in persons with NCGS. As of 2019, reviews have concluded that although FODMAPs may play a role in NCGS, they only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, but not the extra-digestive symptoms that people with NCGS may develop, such as neurological disorders, fibromyalgia, psychological disturbances, and dermatitis.

After exclusion of coeliac disease and wheat allergy, the subsequent step for diagnosis and treatment of NCGS is to start a strict gluten-free diet to assess if symptoms improve or resolve completely. This may occur within days to weeks of starting a GFD, but improvement may also be due to a non-specific, placebo response. Recommendations may resemble those for coeliac disease, for the diet to be strict and maintained, with no transgression. The degree of gluten cross contamination tolerated by people with NCGS is not clear but there is some evidence that they can present with symptoms even after consumption of small amounts. It is not yet known whether NCGS is a permanent or a transient condition. A trial of gluten reintroduction to observe any reaction after one–two years of strict gluten-free diet might be performed.

A subgroup of people with NCGS may not improve by eating commercially available gluten-free products, which are usually rich of preservatives and additives, because chemical additives (such as sulphites, glutamates, nitrates and benzoates) might have a role in evoking functional gastrointestinal symptoms of NCGS. These people may benefit from a diet with a low content of preservatives and additives.

NCGS, which is possibly immune-mediated, now appears to be more common than coeliac disease, with prevalence rates between 0.5 and 13% in the general population.

===Wheat allergy===
People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a wheat allergy. Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. Other symptoms such as dermal reactions like as rashes or hyperpigmentation may also occur in some people. Wheat allergy has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could be anaphylaxis.

The management of wheat allergy consists of complete withdrawal of any food containing wheat and other gluten-containing cereals. Nevertheless, some people with wheat allergy can tolerate barley, rye or oats.

=== Gluten ataxia ===
Gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten. With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing, with loss of Purkinje cells. People with gluten ataxia usually present gait abnormality or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs. Gaze-evoked nystagmus and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common. Myoclonus, palatal tremor, and opsoclonus-myoclonus may also appear.

Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible.

Gluten ataxia accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias. Less than 10% of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom, yet about 40% have intestinal damage.

===As a popular diet===
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the gluten-free diet has become the most popular fad diet in the United States and other countries. Clinicians worldwide have been challenged by an increasing number of people who do not have coeliac disease nor wheat allergy, with digestive or extra-digestive symptoms which improved removing wheat/gluten from the diet. Many of these persons began a gluten-free diet on their own, without having been previously evaluated. Another reason that contributed to this trend was the publication of several books that demonize gluten and point to it as a cause of type 2 diabetes, weight gain and obesity, and a broad list of diseases ranging from depression and anxiety to arthritis and autism. The book that has had the most impact is &quot;Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth About Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar—Your Brain&#x27;s Silent Killers&quot;, by the American neurologist David Perlmutter, published in September 2013. Another book that has had great impact is &quot;Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health&quot;, by the cardiologist William Davis, which refers to wheat as a &quot;chronic poison&quot; and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller within a month of publication in 2011. The gluten-free diet has been advocated and followed by many celebrities to lose weight, such as Miley Cyrus, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kourtney Kardashian, and are used by some professional athletes, who believe the diet can improve energy and health. It became popular in the US, as the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets faded.

Estimates suggest that in 2014, 30% of people in the US and Australia were consuming gluten-free foods, with a growing number, calculated from surveys that by 2016 approximately 100 million Americans would consume gluten-free products. Data from a 2015 Nielsen survey of 30,000 adults in 60 countries around the world conclude that 21% of people prefer to buy gluten-free foods, being the highest interest among the younger generations. In the US, it was estimated that more than half of people who buy foods labeled gluten-free do not have a clear reaction to gluten, and they do so &quot;because they think it will help them lose weight, because they seem to feel better or because they mistakenly believe they are sensitive to gluten.&quot; Although gluten is highly immunologically reactive and humans appear not to have evolved to digest it well, a gluten-free diet is not a healthier option for the general population, other than people with gluten-related disorders or other associated conditions which improve with a gluten-free diet in some cases, such as irritable bowel syndrome and certain autoimmune and neurological disorders. There is no published experimental evidence to support that the gluten-free diet contributes to weight loss.

In a review of May 2015 published in &quot;Gastroenterology&quot;, Fasano et al. conclude that, although there is an evident &quot;fad component&quot; to the recent rise in popularity of the gluten-free diet, there is also growing and unquestionable evidence of the existence of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.

In some cases, the popularity of the gluten-free diet may harm people who must eliminate gluten for medical reasons. For example, servers in restaurants may not take dietary requirements seriously, believing them to be merely a preference. This could prevent appropriate precautions in food handling to prevent gluten cross-contamination. Medical professionals may also confuse medical explanations for gluten intolerance with patient preference. On the other hand, the popularity of the gluten-free diet has increased the availability of commercial gluten-free replacement products and gluten-free grains.

Gluten-free commercial replacement products, such as gluten-free cakes, are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts, so their purchase adds a financial burden. They are also typically higher in calories, fat, and sugar, and lower in dietary fibre. In less developed countries, wheat can represent an important source of protein, since it is a substantial part of the diet in the form of bread, noodles, bulgur, couscous, and other products.

In the British National Health Service, gluten-free foods have been supplied on prescription. For many patients, this meant at no cost. When it was proposed to alter this in 2018, the Department of Health and Social Care made an assessment of the costs and benefits. The potential annual financial saving to the service was estimated at £5.3 million, taking into account the reduction in cost spending and the loss of income from prescription charges. The proposed scenario was actually that patients could still be prescribed gluten-free breads and mixes but would have to buy any other gluten-free products themselves. The savings would only amount to £700,000 a year. Local initiatives by clinical commissioning groups had already reduced the cost of gluten-free foods to the NHS by 39% between 2015 and 2017.

Healthcare professionals recommend against undertaking a gluten-free diet as a form of self-diagnosis, because tests for coeliac disease are reliable only if the person has been consuming gluten recently. There is a consensus in the medical community that people should consult a physician before going on a gluten-free diet, so that a medical professional can accurately test for coeliac disease or any other gluten-induced health issues.

Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit in reducing the symptoms of autism.

=== Research ===
In a 2013 double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge (DBPC) by Biesiekierski et al. in a few people with irritable bowel syndrome, the authors found no difference between gluten or placebo groups and the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity as a syndrome was questioned. Nevertheless, this study had design errors and an incorrect selection of participants, and probably the reintroduction of both gluten and whey protein had a nocebo effect similar in all people, and this could have masked the true effect of gluten/wheat reintroduction.

In a 2015 double-blind placebo cross-over trial, small amounts of purified wheat gluten triggered gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal bloating and pain) and extra-intestinal manifestations (such as foggy mind, depression and aphthous stomatitis) in self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Nevertheless, it remains elusive whether these findings specifically implicate gluten or other proteins present in gluten-containing cereals.

In a 2018 double-blind, crossover research study on 59 persons on a gluten-free diet with challenges of gluten, fructans or placebo, intestinal symptoms (specifically bloating) were borderline significantly higher after challenge with fructans, in comparison with gluten proteins (P=0.049). Although the differences between the three interventions was very small, the authors concluded that fructans (the specific type of FODMAP found in wheat) are more likely to be the cause of gastrointestinal symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, rather than gluten. For this previous study, experts recommend a low FODMAP diet instead of a gluten free diet for those patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders as bloating. In addition, fructans used in the study were extracted from chicory root, so it remains to be seen whether the wheat fructans produce the same effect.

== Eating gluten-free ==
A gluten-free diet is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, proteins present in wheat (and all wheat varieties such as spelt and kamut), barley, rye, oat, and derivatives of these grains such as malt and triticale, and foods that may include them, or shared transportation or processing facilities with them. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial. Oat toxicity in people with gluten-related disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties. Furthermore, oats are frequently cross-contaminated with the other gluten-containing cereals. Pure oat (labelled as &quot;pure oat&quot; or &quot;gluten-free oat&quot;) refers to oats uncontaminated with any of the other gluten-containing cereals. Some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a gluten-free diet, requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of pure oats consumption are still unclear and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in the gluten-free diet.

Other grains, although gluten-free in themselves, may contain gluten by cross-contamination with gluten-containing cereals during grain harvesting, transporting, milling, storing, processing, handling or cooking.

Processed foods commonly contain gluten as an additive (as emulsifiers, thickeners, gelling agents, fillers, and coatings), so they would need specific labeling. Unexpected sources of gluten are, among others, processed meat, vegetarian meat substitutes, reconstituted seafood, stuffings, butter, seasonings, marinades, dressings, confectionary, candies, and ice cream.

Cross-contamination in the home is also a consideration for those who have gluten-related disorders. There can be many sources of cross-contamination, as for example when family members prepare gluten-free and gluten-containing foods on the same surfaces (countertops, tables, etc.) or share utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (cutting boards, colanders, cutlery, etc.), kitchen equipment (toaster, cupboards, etc.) or certain packaged foods (butter, peanut butter, etc.).

Restaurants prove to be another source of cross-contamination for those following a strict gluten-free diet. A study conducted by Columbia University Medical Center found that 32% of foods labeled gluten-free at restaurants contain above 20 parts per million of gluten, meaning that it contains enough gluten that it is no longer considered gluten-free by the Codex Alimentarius. Cross-contamination occurs in these areas frequently because of a general lack of knowledge about the needed level of caution and the prevalence of gluten in restaurant kitchens. If cooks are unaware of the severity of their guest&#x27;s diet restrictions or of the important practices needed to limit cross-contamination, they can unknowingly deliver contaminated food. However, some restaurants utilize a training program for their employees to educate them about the gluten-free diet. The accuracy of the training varies. One resource to find these safer restaurants is an app and website called &quot;Find Me Gluten Free&quot; that allows people following a gluten-free diet to rate the safety of different restaurants from their point of view and describe their experience to help future customers.

Easily locating gluten-free items is one of the main difficulties in following a gluten-free diet. To assist in this process, many restaurants and grocery stores choose to label food items. Restaurants often add a gluten-free section to their menu, or specifically mark gluten-free items with a symbol of some kind. Grocery stores often have a gluten-free aisle, or they will attach labels on the shelf underneath gluten-free items. Though the food is labeled gluten-free in this way, it does not necessarily mean that the food is safe for those with gluten-related disorders, as a compilation of studies suggest.

Medications and dietary supplements are made using excipients that may contain gluten.

The gluten-free diet includes naturally gluten-free food, such as meat, fish, seafood, eggs, milk and dairy products, nuts, legumes, fruit, vegetables, potatoes, pseudocereals (in particular amaranth, buckwheat, chia seed, quinoa), only certain cereal grains (corn, rice, sorghum), minor cereals (including fonio, Job&#x27;s tears, millet, teff, called &quot;minor&quot; cereals as they are &quot;less common and are only grown in a few small regions of the world&quot;), some other plant products (arrowroot, mesquite flour, sago, tapioca) and products made from these gluten-free foods. Many Indian cuisine options, particularly South Indian cuisine, are gluten-free.

===Risks===
An unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins and a higher intake of sugars and saturated fats. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid / carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. These nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education. Pseudocereals (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat) and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have higher biological and nutritional value. Advances towards higher nutrition-content gluten-free bakery products, improved for example in terms of fiber content and glycemic index, have been made by using not exclusively corn starch or other starches to substitute for flour. In this aim, for example the dietary fibre inulin (which acts as a prebiotic) or quinoa or amaranth wholemeal have been as substitute for part of the flour. Similarly, xanthan gum can be used in up to gram quantities per serving in some gluten-free baked goods and can be fermented by specific microbiomes in the gastrointestinal tract. Such substitution has been found to also yield improved crust and texture of bread. It is recommended that anyone embarking on a gluten-free diet check with a registered dietitian to make sure they are getting the required amount of key nutrients like iron, calcium, fiber, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate. Vitamins often contain gluten as a binding agent. Experts have advised that it is important to always read the content label of any product that is intended to be swallowed.

Up to 30% of people with known coeliac disease often continue having or redeveloping symptoms. Also, a lack of symptoms or negative blood antibodies levels are not reliable indicators of intestinal recuperation. Several studies show an incomplete recovery of small bowel despite a strict gluten-free diet, and about 79% of such people have persistent villous atrophy. This lack of recovery is mainly caused by inadvertent exposure to gluten. People with poor basic education and understanding of the gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors. In addition, some people often deliberately continue eating gluten because of limited availability, inferior taste, higher price, and inadequate labelling of gluten-free products. Poor compliance with the regimen is also influenced by age at diagnosis (adolescents), ignorance of the consequences of the lack of a strict treatment and certain psychological factors. Ongoing gluten intake can cause severe disease complications, such as various types of cancers (both intestinal and extra-intestinal) and osteoporosis.

== Regulation and labels==
The term &quot;gluten-free&quot; is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A 2008 systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done.

Regulation of the label gluten-free varies by country. Most countries derive key provisions of their gluten-free labelling regulations from the Codex Alimentarius international standards for food labelling as a standard relating to the labelling of products as gluten-free. It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten. Gluten-free is defined as 20 ppm (= 20 mg/kg) or less. It categorizes gluten-free food as:
* Food that is gluten-free by composition
* Food that has become gluten-free through special processing.
* Reduced gluten content, food which includes food products with between 20 and 100 ppm of gluten Reduced gluten content is left up to individual nations to more specifically define.

The Codex Standard suggests the enzyme-linked Immunoassay (ELISA) R5 Mendez method for indicating the presence of gluten, but allows for other relevant methods, such as DNA. The Codex Standard specifies that the gluten-free claim must appear in the immediate proximity of the name of the product, to ensure visibility.

There is no general agreement on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products. The ELISA method was designed to detect w-gliadins, but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins. The use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify gluten-free food products. The European Union, World Health Organization, and Codex Alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins, gliadins rather than all-wheat proteins.

===Australia===

The Australian government recommends that:
* food labelled gluten-free include no detectable gluten (&lt;3ppm ) oats or their products, cereals containing gluten that have been malted or their products
* food labelled low gluten claims such that the level of 20 mg gluten per 100 g of the food

===Brazil===

All food products must be clearly labelled whether they contain gluten or they are gluten-free. Since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. When a product contains the warning of cross-contamination with wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybridized strains, the warning &quot;contains gluten&quot; is mandatory. The law does not establish a gluten threshold for the declaration of its absence.

===Canada===

Health Canada considers that foods containing levels of gluten not exceeding 20 ppm as a result of contamination, meet the health and safety intent of section B.24.018 of the Food and Drug Regulations when a gluten-free claim is made. Any intentionally added gluten, even at low levels must be declared on the packaging and a gluten-free claim would be considered false and misleading. Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 10 ppm.

===European Union===

The EU European Commission delineates the categories as:

* gluten-free: 20 ppm or less of gluten
* very low gluten foodstuffs: 20-100ppm gluten.

All foods containing gluten as an ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognized EU allergens.

===United States===

Until 2012 anyone could use the gluten-free claim with no repercussion. In 2008, Wellshire Farms chicken nuggets labelled gluten-free were purchased and samples were sent to a food allergy laboratory where they were found to contain gluten. After this was reported in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the products continued to be sold. The manufacturer has since replaced the batter used in its chicken nuggets. The U.S. first addressed gluten-free labelling in the 2004 Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA). The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau published interim rules and proposed mandatory labelling for alcoholic products in 2006. The FDA issued their Final Rule on August 5, 2013.
When a food producer voluntarily chooses to use a gluten-free claim for a product, the food bearing the claim in its labelling may not contain:
* an ingredient that is a gluten-containing grain
* an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain that has not been processed to remove gluten
* an ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain, that has been processed to remove gluten but results in the presence of 20 ppm or more gluten in the food. Any food product claiming to be gluten-free and also bearing the term &quot;wheat&quot; in its ingredient list or in a separate &quot;Contains wheat&quot; statement, must also include the language &quot;*the wheat has been processed to allow this food to meet the FDA requirements for gluten-free foods,&quot; in close proximity to the ingredient statement.
Any food product that inherently does not contain gluten may use a gluten-free label where any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food bearing the claim in its labelling is below 20 ppm gluten.

<doc id="708679" wikidata="Q216781" url="?curid=708679" title="Ricotta">
<text>Ricotta () is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk whey left over from the production of other cheeses. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin.

 () protein can be harvested if the whey is first allowed to become more acidic by additional fermentation (by letting it sit for 12–24 hours at room temperature). Then the acidified whey is heated to near boiling. The combination of low pH and high temperature denatures the protein and causes it to flocculate, forming a fine curd. Once cooled, it is separated by passing the liquid through a fine cloth, leaving the curd behind.

Ricotta curds are creamy white in appearance, and slightly sweet in taste. The fat content varies depending on the milk used. In this form, it is somewhat similar in texture to some fresh cheese variants, though considerably lighter. It is highly perishable. However, ricotta is also made in aged varieties which are preservable for much longer.

==History==
The production of ricotta in the Italian peninsula dates back to the Bronze Age. In the second millennium BC, ceramic vessels called milk boilers started to appear frequently and were apparently unique to the peninsula. These were designed to boil milk at high temperatures and prevent the milk from boiling over. The fresh acid-coagulated cheeses produced with these boilers were probably made with whole milk.

The production of rennet-coagulated cheese, though, overtook the production of fresh whole-milk cheeses during the first millennium BC. Bronze cheese graters found in the graves of the Etruscan elite prove that hard-grating cheeses were popular with the aristocracy. Cheese graters were also commonly used in ancient Roman kitchens. Unlike the fresh acid-coagulated cheese, aged rennet-coagulated cheese could be preserved for much longer.

The increased production of rennet-coagulated cheese led to a large supply of sweet whey as a byproduct. Cheesemakers then started using a new recipe, which used a mixture of whey and milk to make the traditional ricotta as it is known today.

The ancient Romans made ricotta, but writers on agriculture, such as Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, and Columella, do not mention it. They described the production of rennet-coagulated cheese, but did not write about milk boilers or acid-coagulated cheese. A likely reason is that ricotta was not profitable because its very short shelf life did not allow distribution to urban markets. Ricotta was most likely consumed by the herders who made it. Even so, evidence from paintings and literature indicates that ricotta was known and likely eaten by Roman aristocrats, as well.

Ceramic milk boilers were still used by Apennine herders to make ricotta in the 19th century AD. Today, metal milk boilers are used, but production methods have changed little since ancient times.

==Manufacturing process==
Whey proteins are kinds of the many milk proteins. Whey protein itself comprises less than 1% of total milk protein, by weight. Accordingly, ricotta production requires large volumes of input milk. The production process entails the use of heat and acid to coagulate whey protein from whey solution. The whey solution is heated to a near-boiling temperature, much hotter than during the production of the original cheese, of which the whey is a remnant.

==Fresh variants==
&quot;Ricotta di bufala campana&quot; and &quot;ricotta romana&quot; are notable varieties produced in Italy and protected by the European Union&#x27;s protected designation of origin regulation. &quot;Ricotta di bufala campana&quot; is made from the whey left over after the production of &quot;mozzarella di bufala campana&quot;, a protected variety of buffalo mozzarella. &quot;Ricotta romana&quot; is made from the whey of sheep milk.

==Aged variants==


Fresh ricotta can be subject to extra processing to produce variants which have a much longer shelf life. These production methods include salting, baking, smoking, and further fermentation.

&quot;Ricotta salata&quot; is a pressed, salted, dried, and aged variety of the cheese. It is milky-white and firm and used for grating or shaving. &quot;Ricotta salata&quot; is sold in wheels, decorated by a delicate basket-weave pattern.

&quot;Ricotta infornata&quot; () is produced by placing a large lump of soft ricotta in the oven until it develops a brown, lightly charred crust, sometimes even until it becomes sandy brown all the way through. &quot;Ricotta infornata&quot; is popular primarily in Sardinia and Sicily, and is sometimes called &quot;ricotta al forno&quot;.

&quot;Ricotta affumicata&quot; () is similar to &quot;ricotta infornata&quot; and is produced by placing a lump of soft ricotta in a smoker until it develops a grey crust and acquires a charred wood scent, usually of oak or chestnut wood, although, in Friuli, beech wood is used, with the addition of juniper and herbs.

&quot;Ricotta forte&quot;, also known as &quot;ricotta scanta&quot;, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat, or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to age for about a year, during which salt is added and the cheese mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold. The end result is a soft and creamy brown paste which has a very pungent and piquant taste. It is produced in the southern part of the province of Lecce and sold in glass jars. It is smeared on bread, mixed with tomato sauces for pasta, or added to vegetable dishes.

==Common culinary uses==
Like mascarpone in northern Italian cuisine, ricotta is a favorite component of many Italian desserts, such as cheesecakes and cannoli. Also, a variety of different cookies include ricotta as an ingredient.

Ricotta can be beaten smooth and mixed with condiments, such as sugar, cinnamon, orange flower water, strawberries, and occasionally chocolate shavings, and served as a dessert. This basic combination (often with additions such as citrus and pistachios) also features prominently as the filling of the Sicilian cannoli and layered with slices of cake in Palermo&#x27;s cassata.

Combined with eggs and cooked grains, then baked firm, ricotta is also a main ingredient in Neapolitan &quot;pastiera&quot;, one of Italy&#x27;s many &quot;Easter pies&quot;.

Ricotta is also commonly used in savory dishes, including pasta, calzone, stromboli, pizza, manicotti, lasagne, and ravioli.

It also is used as a mayonnaise substitute in traditional egg or tuna salad and as a sauce thickener.

In the United States, American ricotta is almost always made of cow&#x27;s milk whey, as opposed to Italian ricotta which is typically made from the whey of sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk. While both types are low in fat and sodium, the Italian version is naturally sweet, while the American is a little saltier and moister.

In southern Switzerland, a similar ricotta is made, although it is often called &quot;mascarpa&quot;. It is historically a staple food in the mountains. Equivalent whey cheeses (Ziger, Sérac) are produced in the rest of the country.

In France, ricotta is known as recuite and can be made from cow, sheep, or goat milk. The name and technique of preparation change according to the region where it is produced: it is called Greuil, Breuil or Sérou in Gascony, Zenbera in the Basque country, Brousse in Provence, Brocciu in Corsica and Sérac in the Alps.

In Malta, a traditional cow&#x27;s milk cheese known as &quot;irkotta&quot; is made almost identically to the Italian ricotta, with the exception that it is generally made using fresh milk rather than from residual whey, which gives it a slightly firmer, crumblier texture than the Italian variety. Regardless, irkotta is used in very similar ways to Italian ricotta within Maltese cooking, being a primary filling for savoury dishes like ravoli and pies, as well as sweet dishes such as cannoli and cakes. It is also one of the two traditional fillings for &quot;pastizz&quot;, a local savoury pastry snack, with the other being mushy peas.

In Tunisia, the &quot;rigouta&quot; from the city of Béja is a close relative to the ricotta, except that it is always fresh-soft and is not aged. It is exclusively made from the whey of Sicilo-Sarda sheep&#x27;s milk. &quot;Rigouta&quot; is also used as the basis of several preparations and dishes of Tunisian cuisine.

In Spanish, ricotta is known as &quot;requesón&quot;. It can be salted or sweetened for cooking purposes. It was brought to Mexico by the Spaniards, although it is not as commonly used as &quot;queso fresco&quot;. It is sometimes used as filling for &quot;tlacoyos&quot; and &quot;tacos dorados&quot;, and in the central west area (Jalisco, Michoacán, and Colima) it is spread over&quot; tostadas&quot; or &quot;bolillos&quot;, or served as a side to beans. In Portugal and Brazil, a similar product is called &quot;requeijão&quot;.

In the Balkans, Romanian &quot;urdă&quot; (), Macedonian &quot;urda&quot; (урда) and Bulgarian &quot;izvara&quot; (извара) are made by reprocessing the whey drained from any type of cheese. &quot;Urdă&quot; is thus similar to fresh ricotta as its fabrication implies the same technological process. However, Romanian &quot;urdă&quot; is neither smoked nor baked in the oven like some variants of the Italian ricotta. &quot;Urdă&quot; has been produced by Romanian shepherds for centuries and is consequently regarded by Romanians as a Romanian traditional product.

In Greece, cheeses very similar to ricotta are &quot;anthotyros &quot; (ανθότυρο) and &quot;manouri&quot; (μανούρι), made from sheep or goat milk. Similarly in Cyprus, &quot;anari&quot; (αναρή) is made from the same types of milk.

<text>Thirteen Senses are a post-Britpop band from Penzance, Cornwall. The group released the album &quot;The Invitation&quot; on 27 September 2004, along with several singles: &quot;Thru the Glass&quot;, &quot;Do No Wrong&quot;, &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;The Salt Wound Routine&quot;, of which the first three reached the top 40 of the UK singles chart. Their second album, &quot;Contact&quot;, was released in April 2007. Thirteen Senses are the only Cornish band to have a top 20 single.

==History==
Thirteen Senses started out as Soul Magician, that began in school when Will South started writing songs which he showed Adam Wilson. He in turn liked the songs and left the other band he was in at the time. Soul Magician took off when South and Wilson met Tom Welham. The latter knew Brendon James and they all became friends.

In 2002 Soul Magician released an EP, &quot;Inside A Healing Mind&quot;, which was produced by Leon Phillips. It consisted of four tracks, one of which was later released as a B-side. &quot;Attracting Submission&quot; is found on the &quot;Do No Wrong&quot; 7&quot; vinyl. After that came in 2002 the &quot;No Other Life Is Attractive&quot; EP: the first Thirteen Senses release, produced by Dare Mason. This had five tracks. Four of them have been released as B-sides, the exception being &quot;Sound&quot;. They then issued in 2003, &quot;Falls in the Dark&quot;, a self-released and independent demo album.

The band&#x27;s next release and major label debut album was &quot;The Invitation&quot;. This consisted of twelve tracks and reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart on its re-release.

At the beginning of 2004, and before &quot;The Invitation&quot;, Thirteen Senses released their first single, &quot;Thru the Glass&quot;. This was released on both CD and 7&quot; vinyl. The B-side was identical on both releases: &quot;No Other Life Is Attractive&quot;. Later, the next single was &quot;Do No Wrong&quot; and it reached number 38 in the official UK singles chart. To promote it, Thirteen Senses went on tour, including a homecoming gig at the Hall for Cornwall in Truro.

The third single from the band was &quot;Into the Fire&quot;. This was also released on two CDs and vinyl &quot;Into The Fire&quot; was used on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. After this came a re-release of &quot;Thru the Glass&quot; which broke the group into the UK Top 20.

The band toured both in the UK and Europe in 2005 and made several appearances at festivals such as Glastonbury, T in the Park and V Festival.

The band spent much of the latter part of 2005 and early 2006 in the recording studio, working on their next album, &quot;Contact&quot;. It was released on 2 April 2007. It was originally planned to be released in February 2007 but after playing three pre-album gigs at The Luminaire in London (on the thirteenth of the months of October, November and December), the band produced new tracks. &quot;Talking to Sirens&quot;, one of the new tracks from &quot;Contact&quot;, was only played at the last gig. Due to the new album release date, their UK tour was rescheduled for March.

On 28 August 2007 Thirteen Senses announced through their website that they had begun recording their third album, and between April–July 2008 they previewed samples of 8 demo recordings on their Myspace page. After several months without official contact from the band, on 28 May 2009, Brendon James announced that their third studio album was close to completion and it would, &quot;all being well, be released within the next 2–3 months&quot;.

On 16 March 2010 the band made their third album &quot;Crystal Sounds&quot; available to stream on their website, thirteensenses.com. A day later they announced this on their MySpace page and said the album would be available to stream &quot;for a limited time&quot;. The physical version of &quot;Crystal Sounds&quot; was released on 21 February 2011 with four tracks not featured on the early release.

On 27 February 2013, the band announced via Facebook and Twitter that &quot;work on a new album is reaching its conclusion... more news coming soon...!&quot;

On 6 February 2014, the band announced via Facebook and Twitter that their fourth album &quot;A Strange Encounter&quot; would be released on 5 May 2014.

On 24 June 2024, the band announced via Facebook and Twitter (now also known as X) that their fifth album &quot;The Bound and the Infinite&quot; would be released on 9 August 2024.

<text>The Pearl and Hermes Atoll (), also known as Pearl and Hermes Reef, is part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a group of small islands and atolls that form the farthest northwest portion of the Hawaiian island chain. The atoll consists of a variable number of flat and sandy islets, typically between five and seven. More were noted in historical sources but have since been lost to erosion and rising sea levels.

The atoll is named after &quot;Pearl&quot; and , a pair of English whaleships that wrecked there in 1822. It has been the site of at least eight known shipwrecks, including the Japanese &quot;Wiji Maru&quot;, SS &quot;Quartette&quot;, and most recently the M/V &quot;Casitas&quot;, which ran aground on the reef in 2005.

The atoll is an important habitat for seabirds, marine life, and invertebrate species. Twenty-two bird species nest and breed on the islands, including twenty percent of the world&#x27;s population of black-footed albatrosses. The atoll has historically been included with the rest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in conservation efforts. It is included in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, created in 2006. Ghost nets and other fishing debris, rising sea levels, and the invasive algae &quot;Chondria tumulosa&quot; pose a significant risk to the atoll and its wildlife.

==Geography==

The Pearl and Hermes Atoll is the third northernmost atoll of Hawaii, behind Midway and Kure, approximately northwest of Honolulu and east-southeast of Midway Atoll. Like the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, the atoll observes Hawaii Standard Time. In total, Pearl and Hermes has about of land and almost of coral reef habitat. The fringing coral reef which surrounds the atoll is roughly in circumference and open to the west.

The atoll&#x27;s land area consists of several small islands which are periodically washed over when winter storms pass, along with several ephemeral sand spits. The islets are low and flat, with an average elevation of no more than in 2012, and there are no sources of fresh water on any of them. As of 2012, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the atoll consists of five islands. Earlier sources note the presence of other islets, including a Sand Island and a Bird Island.

From largest to smallest, the five remaining islands are Southeast Island (), Seal-Kittery (), North Island (), Grass Island (), and Little North Island (). Only the three largest islands have vegetation.

Comma-shaped North Island is the atoll&#x27;s northernmost island. Little North Island lies to the southeast, less than away. Southeast Island lies approximately to the southeast of Little North. Grass Island approximately east, and Seal Kittery just under to the east of that.

==Nomenclature==
The atoll is named for the ships &quot;Pearl&quot; and , which were wrecked upon it in 1822.

The Hawaiian-language name for the atoll, &quot;Holoikauaua&quot;, was established in the late 1990s by the Hawaiian Lexicon Committee following an effort to restore traditional Hawaiian names which had been lost, misspelled, or replaced with foreign names. Because its original Hawaiian name was not known, the Committee conferred the new name of &quot;Holoikauaua&quot; to the atoll, in reference to the Hawaiian monk seal which frequents the waters there.

==History==
===Initial discovery by Europeans===
The atoll was discovered in 1822 when the English whaleships &quot;Pearl&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; ran aground on the surrounding reefs. The two ships had been en route to Japan from Honolulu through the uncharted waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Sometime late in the evening of April 24 or early in the morning of April 25, the 258-ton &quot;Hermes&quot; ran aground on an unseen reef. Shortly thereafter, the 327-ton &quot;Pearl&quot; also ran aground when it approached to provide assistance. The combined crews of both ships, some 57 sailors, were marooned on an unspecified island nearby for several months. During that time, James Robinson, a carpenter&#x27;s mate, directed the construction of a small 30-ton vessel from the wreckage. Some accounts provide the name of the vessel as &quot;Drift&quot;, while others state it was called &quot;Deliverance&quot;.

On July 1, before the beach-built vessel could be launched, the passing ship &quot;Earl of Morby&quot; was sighted. 46 of the sailors took passage on the &quot;Earl of Morby&quot;, but Robinson and eleven others opted to purchase the vessel they had built and sail it back to Honolulu in the hopes of recovering some of the losses incurred by the wreck. The sailors managed to sail the small vessel back to the main Hawaiian islands without further loss of life. They sold it for $2,000 USD. Robinson remained in Honolulu, and founded the James Robinson and Company shipyard there in 1827.

King Kamehameha III of Hawaii claimed the atoll by proclamation in 1854. In 1857, it was surveyed by the crew of the Hawaiian schooner &quot;Manuokawai&quot;. The United States took possession of the atoll in 1859 by way of Captain N.C. Brooks and his ship &quot;Gambia&quot;. Brooks reported that the atoll had eleven or twelve islets, and that some of them had trees and coarse grass. In 1867, the crew of the &quot;Laconda&quot; produced the first reliable chart of the reef, which was published by the United States Navy.

Entrepreneurs from a rabbit canning business intentionally released rabbits on Southeast Island in 1894, where they devoured all the island&#x27;s vegetation. This was the first documented instance of mammals being introduced to the atoll.

The Japanese schooner &quot;Wiji Maru&quot; was wrecked on the atoll in 1904, destroying the ship and its cargo of feathers. There was no loss of life, however. In 1916, crew members from the &quot;Thetis&quot; reported that they had spotted rabbits and Japanese fishing huts on Southeast Island. In 1923, the vessels of the Tanager Expedition stopped at the atoll and killed &quot;all but one rabbit on Southeast Island.&quot;

===Exploitation of oysters===
In 1927, Captain William Greig Anderson of the Lanikai Fishing Company was fishing for tuna and in the process, discovered beds of black-lip pearl oysters in the atoll. He reported that they were rich with pearls – the only pearl beds in the United States. Anderson formed a trading company to capitalize on his find. Over the next three years, his trading company harvested some 20,000 pearls from the atoll, with the largest of these having a reported value of US$5,000. Some 150 tons of oyster shells, valued for their shiny mother-of-pearl, were harvested in the process. They were primarily sold to button manufacturers on the United States mainland.

In 1929, oyster harvesting in the atoll was made illegal by the government of the Territory of Hawaii. In 1930, the United States Bureau of Fisheries decided to conduct a thorough study of the atoll, led by Dr. Paul Galtsoff. The United States Navy loaned the minesweeper ship &quot;Whippoorwill&quot; for the five-week expedition, which covered the reef&#x27;s geography, flora, and invertebrate and fish populations. A specific emphasis was placed on the pearl oyster population. Only 470 oysters were found. 320 were collected alive, and 150 were opened for examination. An estimated 10% contained pearls. Based on those findings, the surveyors concluded that Captain Anderson must have harvested between 150,000 and 200,000 oysters to obtain his reported 20,000 pearls, which had significantly depleted the oyster beds.

The &quot;Whippoorwill&quot; expedition documented wildlife aside from the oysters: Dr. Galtsoff&#x27;s report indicated that they had found seals, sharks, sea turtles, albatrosses, booby birds, and numerous species of fish. They did not find any of the trees which Captain Brooks had mentioned in his 1857 report.

===Later wrecks===
On December 21, 1952, the &quot;SS Quartette&quot;, a Liberty ship weighing 7,198 tons, struck the eastern reef of the atoll at a speed of . The ship was driven further onto the reef by rough waves and winds, which collapsed the bow and damaged two forward holds. The crew was evacuated by the SS &quot;Frontenac Victory&quot; the following day. The salvage tug &quot;Ono&quot; arrived on December 25 to attempt to tow the ship clear, but persistent stormy weather forced a delay of the rescue attempt. On January 3, before another rescue attempt could be made, the ship&#x27;s anchors tore loose and the &quot;Quartette&quot; was blown onto the reef. It was deemed a total loss. Several weeks later, it snapped in half at the keel and the two pieces sank. The wreck site now serves as an artificial reef which provides a habitat for many fish species.
On July 2, 2005, the research vessel &quot;M/V Casitas&quot;, chartered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&quot;,&quot; ran aground on the north end of the atoll. The ship was carrying large quantities of gasoline, diesel fuel, and oil, which posed a substantial risk of leaking. Leak-prevention and extraction efforts led by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in conjunction with other United States Government and State of Hawaii agencies began immediately. Although several people on board were forced to evacuate the ship, there was no loss of life. The initial grounding, combined with the rescue efforts, caused extensive damage to the reef including &quot;breakage of coral heads, scouring of the substrate, and injury to the reef structure itself&quot;. The ship was fully removed from the atoll on August 4, 2005, but was too damaged for salvage. She was towed to a site northwest of Pearl and Hermes Atoll approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where she was sunk in waters over deep. Efforts to remove remaining debris and repair the reef began in 2011.

===Site exploration===
In 2004, divers from NOAA located wreckage believed to be from the &quot;Pearl&quot; during a debris removal dive. They were not able to complete a full survey at the time due to the challenging site environment. The same dive team also located the wreck site of an unknown fishing vessel during the same trip, which they nicknamed the &quot;Oshima&quot; site as some of the components located were similar to the Japanese &quot;Oshima&quot; design. Among the components located were &quot;a six-cylinder Atlas Imperial diesel and machinery scatter, propeller shaft and propeller, a marine propulsion plant popular in the early decades of the 20th century.&quot; Researchers theorized that the wreckage was an East Asian fishing vessel that struck the reef sometime after 1918, based on the age of the components.

Maritime archaeologists from the NOAA returned to the wreck site of the &quot;Pearl&quot; in 2005 and 2006 to conduct further surveys. The 2005 survey was based on the NOAA research vessel &quot;Hiʻialakai&quot;. The same group also attempted to survey the nearby site of the &quot;Hermes&quot;, but were prevented by poor weather conditions. A number of artifacts were found at the &quot;Pearl&quot; site, including anchors, two cannons, and large try pots for rendering whale blubber. Many smaller artifacts were found actually embedded into the coral of the reef. The 2006 survey focused on completing a full site plan of the wreckage. In contrast to the scattered state of the &quot;Hermes&quot; site, the artifacts of the &quot;Pearl&quot; site are grouped roughly in the same configuration that they would have had on the intact ship, with site length being approximately the length the ship would have been.
In 2008, NOAA maritime archaeologists returned to the site of the &quot;Hermes&quot; to complete the survey begun in 2005. The site was confirmed to be located about to the west of the &quot;Pearl&quot; site. A full site plan was completed, and both photographs and high definition video were made. The site contained similar artifacts to those found at the site of the &quot;Pearl&quot;, including two anchors and four cannons. At least 33 cannonballs were found, stored in linear racks, as well as stores of musket balls. Finally, some 150 iron ballast pieces were found. The extremely scattered state of the wreckage seems to confirm that the &quot;Hermes&quot; broke apart quickly and scattered with force across the sea floor.

==Flora and fauna==
===Plant life===
The islets of the Pearl and Hermes Atoll support thirteen native plant species and seven introduced species, including coastal grasses, vines, and herbal plants. Invasive plant species are considered a major conservation issue on the atoll, as they often out-compete and replace native species. As an example, &quot;Setaria verticillata&quot;, an undesirable noxious weed, has displaced the native grass &quot;Eragrostis variabilis&quot; on Southeast Island. An illegal landing by the military in the 1960s brought invasive field mustard seeds from Midway Atoll, which had to be removed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The flowering plant &quot;Verbesina encelioides&quot; has been identified as a major invasive threat since at least 2001. Although it provides food and nesting space for small songbirds, it poses a significant threat of entanglement to native seabirds, so removal is considered a priority for conservation purposes.

===Avian life===
The Pearl and Hermes Atoll is an important nesting area for many seabirds. Approximately 160,000 birds from 22 different species are known to live and breed on the Atoll. Tristram&#x27;s storm petrels and black-footed albatrosses are among the most prominent. In 2001, it was reported that twenty percent of the world&#x27;s population of black-footed albatrosses nested on Pearl and Hermes. Pearl and Hermes also hosts one of two known sites where little terns nest in Hawaii. In addition, the endangered Laysan finch was introduced to the island in 1967 to provide a backup population of these birds, should a hurricane, disease, rat introduction, or other disaster wipe out the population on the island of Laysan.

===Invertebrates===
The Pearl and Hermes Atoll provides an extensive and unique habitat for invertebrates, including various sponges and thirty-three species of stony corals. Some invasive invertebrate species have been found on the reef, including the orange-striped sea anemone, which is native to Japan, and the Christmas tree hydroid, which competes with native invertebrates for space.

The atoll was once heavily populated with black-lip pearl oysters, but overfishing from 1927 to 1930 caused the population to crash to only 470 in 1930. An expedition in 1950 turned up only six live oysters, and another in 1969 only found one. Surveys in 1994 and 2000 also found only a few oysters, and a full analysis by the NOAA in 2003 concluded that the population has never recovered to pre-harvesting levels.

===Other wildlife===
The Pearl and Hermes Atoll supports breeding populations of endangered Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. Spinner dolphins are known to mate in the area. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, &quot;the atoll has the highest standing stock of fish and the highest number of fish species in the NWHI&quot;, including sabre squirrelfish, various eels, Galapagos sharks, Sandbar sharks, giant trevally or ulua, angelfish, āweoweo or Hawaiian bigeyes, parrotfish, and various types of lobsters. Although they are rare in the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, masked angelfish and Japanese angelfish are common in the Pearl and Hermes Atoll.

In 2016, scientists from the Bishop Museum, working with the NOAA, described a new species of butterflyfish found off the Pearl and Hermes Atoll, at a depth of . It was named &quot;Prognathodes basabei&quot; in honor of diver Pete Basabe, who provided support to the dives that first discovered the species.
==Conservation efforts==

Because of its small size, Pearl and Hermes Atoll has typically not been singled out for individual environmental protection; historically, it has been bundled with the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a protected region. The region was first protected in 1909 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation through , which included Pearl and Hermes Atoll. Over the next century, protection of the region increased incrementally, culminating in President George W. Bush signing in 2006, designating the waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument under the 1906 Antiquities Act.

===Threats===
Derelict fishing gear (ghost nets) and other types of marine debris have had a major impact on the reefs and associated fauna of the atoll. Pearl and Hermes Atoll is considered a high-risk entanglement zone for monk seals. Efforts have been undertaken to lessen the threat of this growing problem, including attempts at prevention as well as recurring debris removal projects. A multi-agency study was launched in 1999 to remove and catalogue debris from the water surrounding Lisianski Island and Pearl and Hermes Atoll. During this project, a total of of debris was removed from reefs and beaches around Pearl and Hermes. In 2000, the joint NOAA and NMFS Derelict Fishing Net Removal Project was launched, with the objective of removing fishing debris from the atoll and identifying any non-native species. In 2003, of marine debris was removed from the Pearl and Hermes reefs. In 2014, a net tangle weighing was located in the atoll. It was long, wide, and deep, and took three days to dismantle and remove.

Rising sea level is also a major concern for the atoll due to the extremely low elevation of most of the islands. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency projects that sea level will rise by the year 2100. Southeast Island is only above sea level, and would be almost entirely submerged if sea levels rise that much. The other islets would also lose significant amounts of land area. Estimates of total land area loss range from 15% to 65% in a scenario of median sea-level rise, threatening the habitats of monk seals, sea turtles, and nesting birds.

In 2016, a mysterious new red algae species known as &quot;Chondria tumulosa&quot; was spotted growing on the reefs. By 2019, it had smothered and killed large amounts of reef on the northeast section of the atoll. Analysis of the species and management techniques will be required to prevent the species from taking over other reefs on the atoll and the rest of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.

==Climate==
Because there are no weather stations on the Pearl and Hermes Atoll, the following climate information is taken from sources for the Midway Atoll, which is approximately north-northwest of Pearl and Hermes. Like Midway, Pearl and Hermes has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen classification &quot;Aw&quot;). The atoll has no cold season. Its wet season corresponds to the high-sun months, and its dry season corresponds to the low-sun months.

<text>Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is a science fiction novel by American writer Kate Wilhelm, published in 1976. The novel is composed of three parts, &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang,&quot; &quot;Shenandoah,&quot; and &quot;At the Still Point,&quot; and is set in a post-apocalyptic era, a concept popular among authors who took part in the New Wave Science Fiction movement in the 1960s.

Before the publication of Wilhelm&#x27;s novel in 1976, part one of &quot;Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang&quot; was featured in the fifteenth edition of &quot;Orbit.&quot; Kate Wilhelm was a regular contributor to the &quot;Orbit&quot; anthology series, and assisted Damon Knight and other contributors with the anthology&#x27;s editing. In its time, &quot;Orbit&quot; was known for publishing works of SF that differed from the mainstream of science fiction being published at the time.

The title of the book is a quotation from William Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 73.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place in Virginia, somewhere near the Shenandoah River, and quickly establishes its plot line in a post-apocalyptic era. The collapse of civilization around the world has resulted from massive environmental changes and global disease, which were attributed to large-scale pollution. With a range of members privileged by virtue of education and monetary resources, one large family founds an isolated community in an attempt to survive the still-developing global disasters. As the death toll rises, mainly to disease and nuclear warfare, they discover that the human population left on earth is universally infertile. From cloning experiments conducted through the study of mice, the scientists in the small community theorize that the infertility might be reversed after multiple generations of cloning, and the family begins cloning themselves in an effort to survive. The assumption is that after a few generations of cloning, the people will be able to revert to traditional biological reproduction.

However, to the horror of the few surviving members of the original group, the clones who are finally coming of age reject the idea of sexual reproduction in favor of further cloning. The original members of the community, too old and outnumbered by the clones to resist, are forced to accept the new social order and the complications that arise.

The new generations are cloned in groups of four to ten individuals, and due to a strong emotional and mental connection between the clones, they have a strong sense of empathy for one another. As the old generation dies out and the clones seek to expand their territory, they quickly discover that prolonged separation from other members of their group produces irreversible psychological stress. One woman, Molly, after being separated from her clones while on an expedition to find materials in the ruins of nearby cities, regains a &quot;human&quot; sense of individuality, which her fellow clones believe to be dangerous to the community. As a result of this, she is exiled.

Though Molly is allowed to live by herself in peace, she is not allowed contact with the other clones except the members who bring her the supplies she needs. In secret, she goes on to have a child with Ben, one of the clones who accompanied her on the journey to the surrounding cities. After a few years of successful secrecy, she and the child are found, and although Molly and Ben are expelled from the community, the child, Mark, is allowed to stay. The clones, though wary of his threatening individuality, hope to study him in order to learn more about non-clones. As the child becomes a man, he realizes that his uniqueness gives him individuality and the ability to live away from the community, something which the clones are now unable to do. The leaders of the community realize that the latest generations of clones are losing all sense of creativity and are unable to come up with new solutions to problems; simultaneously they see that the growing lack of high-technology equipment will result in the community losing the ability to continue with the cloning process.

As the only &quot;naturally&quot; produced human in the community, Mark seeks his own solution to the problem, and by force he leads a group of fertile women and children to abandon the community and start over, leaving a trail of devastation to the clone community in the wake of his departure. He returns to the community twenty years later to discover that in the wake of this disaster, the clones, unable to survive with their limited adaptability, have perished and the village has been destroyed. At novel&#x27;s end, Mark returns to the community he created, where all of the children and younger generations, products of conventional reproduction, continue to thrive.

The novel makes a passing reference to the end of global warming due to a decline in human pollution:

<text>Juana Rosario Molina Villafañe (; born 1 October 1961) is an Argentine singer, songwriter and actress, based in Buenos Aires. She is known for her distinctive sound, considered an exponent of folktronica, although it has also been described as ambient, experimental, neofolk, chill-out, indietronica, psychedelic, indie pop, and progressive folk.

The daughter of tango singer and actress Chunchuna Villafañe, she achieved fame as a sketch comedy actress in the 1990s, first as a guest in various shows and in 1991 with her show, &quot;Juana y sus hermanas&quot;. At the height of her popularity, she quit her job as an actress to pursue a music career. Her debut album, &quot;Rara&quot;, was subsequently released in 1996, and panned by local critics who resented her departure from television. Discouraged by the criticism, she moved to Los Angeles, where her music had been better received, and she familiarized herself with electronic instruments. She then returned to Buenos Aires to produce her second album, &quot;Segundo&quot;, incorporating the sonic elements she had learned. Each one of her following albums has added a new complexity to her music, which is characterized by layered loops of acoustic and electronic sounds.

Despite the initial negative reaction to her music in her home country, music critics have consistently acclaimed Molina&#x27;s work, praising her music and experimentation. In 2013, &quot;El País&quot; wrote, &quot;she established herself as the star of the avant-garde sound of her country in the world.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Robin Denselow called her the &quot;one-time Queen of Latin chill&quot; and wrote: &quot;[she] has built up a global cult following as one of the most experimental musicians in Argentina.&quot;

==Early life==
Juana Rosario Molina Villafañe was born to a family of artists in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 1, 1961. She is the eldest daughter of Horacio Molina, a tango singer, and Chunchuna Villafañe, an actress and model. She has a younger sister who has also worked as an actress and musician. The family lived in the central Buenos Aires &quot;barrio&quot; of Caballito. Her mother was a record collector, exposing her to various types of music. She began to learn to play the guitar at age 5. In 1967, Juana recorded her first song with her father, &quot;Te regalo esta canción&quot; (&quot;I gift you this song&quot;), as a gift to her mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. Horacio Molina released the song as a single —without his young daughter knowing—which sold 45 thousand copies. She also performed the song live with her father on national television.

In 1976, the family left for Paris, France, due to the military dictatorship that overthrew president Isabel Perón. While in Paris, she listened to what is now known as &quot;world music&quot; on French radio stations. In various interviews, Molina has recalled a visit to a Spanish hippie family friend who introduced her to Indian classical music, whose drones have had an enduring influence on her music. In 1981, Molina returned to Buenos Aires. To finance her architecture studies, she had various small jobs, including an unsuccessful experience as a backing vocalist in small bands.

==Career==
As she could not make a living through music, Molina decided to find a job that paid well and did not consume much time. She decided on a career in television as the means to this end and spent some months looking for a show that could use her services. She recorded a homemade audition tape for the studio and was offered a contract the same day. Molina began her television career in 1988 with the ATC show &quot;La noticia rebelde&quot; (&quot;Rebel News&quot;, a wordplay on &quot;La novicia rebelde&quot;), where she would record one day a week and get paid for five. Her popular sketches parodied &quot;porteño&quot; women of various social classes. In October of the same year, Molina joined the cast of &quot;El mundo de Antonio Gasalla&quot; (&quot;Antonio Gasalla&#x27;s World&quot;), led by comedy actor Antonio Gasalla. The show, which ran until 1990, further cemented her popularity as a sketch comedy actress and writer. The show was also performed live at the Teatro Gran Rex and in Mar del Plata.
The pinnacle of her success came with her show, &quot;Juana y sus hermanas&quot; (&quot;Juana and Her Sisters&quot;, a wordplay on &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;), which premiered in 1991. Molina became Argentina&#x27;s most popular comedian, having her show syndicated to other Latin American countries. Molina was dubbed &quot;the new Niní Marshall&quot; by the press, and won two Martín Fierro Awards. A compilation album of songs by Molina featured in the show was released. In 1993 Molina became pregnant with her only child, Francisca, and had to suspend her show. Reflecting on her rapid rise to stardom and distance from the music career she had always wanted, the actress canceled the show in 1994. She recalls: &quot;There was a moment when I imagined myself watching MTV as a decrepit old woman (like MTV would last a lifetime), thinking &#x27;I could have done that.&#x27; I pictured myself feeling an infinite grudge, hatred, envy.&quot;

Produced by Gustavo Santaolalla and recorded in 1995, Molina&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Rara&quot;, was released in 1996. The album was poorly marketed; Micaela Ortelli of &quot;Página/12&quot; wrote: &quot;Never did an Argentine radio play a song from that album, – too pop to be folk and too folk, perhaps, to be radio material.&quot; Live shows were also problematic, as audiences expected her to act like on television. The album was better received in Los Angeles, where Molina settled in 1998. Having learned how to record her music, she began to self-produce new material at the request of DreamWorks Records. Although the company ultimately did not sign her, these recordings would become &quot;Segundo&quot;, her second studio album. By 2000, she had finished recording the album and, back in Buenos Aires, she met Daniel Melero, who mixed the record. The music of &quot;Segundo&quot; was the result of Molina&#x27;s new insights in timbre and her meeting with Alejandro Franov, who taught her &quot;the endless sound possibilities that keyboards allow.&quot; Despite remaining virtually unknown in her native country, Molina&#x27;s music found success in Japan, and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. American musician David Byrne bought &quot;Segundo&quot; — intrigued by its artwork — and quickly became an admirer of the record. He contacted Molina, and she became the opening act of his American tour.

== Appearances in other media ==
Molina gained wider exposure with North American public radio listeners when Jad Abumrad used her music to score a 2008 episode of &quot;Radiolab&quot; and produced a bonus podcast featuring an interview with Molina and a remix of her song &quot;Un día.&quot; Molina&#x27;s song, &quot;Sin dones&quot;, from &quot;Halo&quot;, was used on the episode &quot;Things Bad Begun&quot; in Season 3 of the show &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; in 2017.

<text> (short for word count) is a command in Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems. The program reads either standard input or a list of computer files and generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count, word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both individual file and total statistics follow.

==Example==
Sample execution of wc:
 $ wc foo bar
 40 149 947 foo
 2294 16638 97724 bar
 2334 16787 98671 total
The first column is the count of newlines, meaning that the text file codice_1 has 40 newlines while codice_2 has 2294 newlines- resulting in a total of 2334 newlines. The second column indicates the number of words in each text file showing that there are 149 words in codice_1 and 16638 words in codice_2 giving a total of 16787 words. The last column indicates the number of characters in each text file, meaning that the file codice_1 has 947 characters while codice_2 has 97724 characters 98671 characters all in all.

Newer versions of codice_7 can differentiate between byte and character count. This difference arises with Unicode which includes multi-byte characters. The desired behaviour is selected with the codice_8 or codice_9 options.

Through a pipeline, it can also be used to preview the output size of a command with a potentially large output, without it printing the text into the console:

$ grep -r &quot;example&quot; |wc
 1071 23337 101349
==History==
 is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It appeared in Version 1 Unix.

GNU codice_7 used to be part of the GNU textutils package; it is now part of GNU coreutils. The version of codice_7 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Paul Rubin and David MacKenzie.

A codice_7 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the GnuWin32 project and the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Usage==
*codice_13 prints the byte count
*codice_14 prints the line count
*codice_15 prints the character count
*codice_16 prints the word count
*codice_17 prints the length of the longest line (GNU extension)

<text>The Conservative People&#x27;s Party (German: , KVP) was a short-lived conservative and Christian democratic political party of the moderate right in the last years of the Weimar Republic. It broke away from the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) in July 1930 as a result of the DNVP&#x27;s increasing shift to the right under the leadership of Alfred Hugenberg. It remained a numerically insignificant minor party but was represented in the governments of Heinrich Brüning (1930–1932). The KVP folded on 31 March 1933 after it ran out of funds.

== Name ==
The term (popular conservative) was probably first used by journalist Hermann Ullmann in 1926. He had in mind conservatives of both the Catholic and Protestant faiths whose fundamental attitude was Christian, social and anti-nationalist. In the two years that followed, became a collective term for those in the DNVP who opposed the party&#x27;s 1928 shift to the right and wanted to continue the earlier cooperation with the Catholic Centre Party. The term is also found in a 1927 essay by DNVP politician Walther Lambach, &quot;Monarchism&quot;, which stated that the DNVP should not be one-sidedly monarchist but a &quot;popular conservative party of self-help&quot;.

Among older DNVP members such as Kuno Graf von Westarp and in the conservative monarchist newspaper &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot;, the name was controversial. The &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; said that the original name &quot;Volkskonservative Vereinigung&quot; (People&#x27;s Conservative Association) weakened the clear term &quot;conservative&quot;, although Hermann Ullmann defended the new name because he thought that &quot;conservative&quot; should never again be understood as &quot;reactionary&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The new party grew out of criticism in parts of the DNVP of the policies of the publisher Alfred Hugenberg, who had ousted Kuno von Westarp from the post of party chairman in 1928. Hugenberg&#x27;s active support for the 1929 referendum against the Young Plan that finalized a schedule for German reparations payments to the victors of World War I, and the DNVP&#x27;s cooperation during the referendum drive with the Nazi Party (NSDAP), met with party members&#x27; particular disapproval. When the bill resulting from the referendum, the &quot;Law against the Enslavement of the German People&quot;, was put to a vote in the Reichstag, about twenty out of 73 DNVP deputies refused to follow Hugenberg. He responded with party expulsion proceedings. Gottfried Treviranus and other deputies resigned from the party and von Westarp from the chairmanship of the parliamentary group. Some of the dissidents joined the Christian Social People&#x27;s Service and others the Christian-National Peasants&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; Party.

A group around Treviranus and Walther Lambach formed the People&#x27;s Conservative Association at a meeting in the Prussian House of Lords on 28 January 1930. Initially the association was not to be a party, only a means to gather like-minded people together in order to bring the DNVP back to its former course. The provisional People&#x27;s Conservative Association became a kind of supra-regional political club. In the House of Lords, Treviranus said that the DNVP had to decide between a conservative and a National Socialist course and that the People&#x27;s Conservative Association was ready to merge into a large right-of-center party. Because of this it had no party program.

A few months later, there were once again splits in the DNVP due to its stance with regard to the government of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party. A group around von Westarp left the party, came together with the People&#x27;s Conservative Association and formed the Conservative People&#x27;s Party.
=== Participation in government ===
The party supported Brüning&#x27;s center-right policy. From March 1930 to May 1932 Gottfried Treviranus served in the government in various ministerial positions, including Minister for the Occupied Territories and Minister of Transport. His presence in the cabinet gave the party a weight beyond its tiny representation in parliament, which was just four seats out of 577 after the September 1930 election. With Brüning&#x27;s dismissal in May 1932, Treviranus&#x27; tenure as minister also ended, and with it the KVP&#x27;s participation in political power. The KVP did not run in the July 1932 election, the first in which the Nazi Party won the largest number of seats.

=== Outside of parliament ===
In the period of the presidential cabinets that followed Brüning, the KVP was no longer represented in parliament. They reacted to the government of Franz von Papen with wait-and-see skepticism. They expected a prolonged era of reaction and were critical of the curtailment of unemployment insurance and of Papen&#x27;s foreign policy, but they initially welcomed the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état, when Reich President Paul von Hindenburg replaced the legal government of the Free State of Prussia by von Papen as Reich Commissioner.

Initially the party distanced itself from Reich Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher – the last Chancellor before Adolf Hitler – but later, out of necessity, took a more positive stance towards his government. Even if they formed no strong ties with him, the party&#x27;s attitude became more favorable when he returned to Brüning&#x27;s policies. Heinz Dähnhardt, one of the original founders of the KVP, said that Schleicher was the only alternative to Hitler. In doing so, he echoed the opinion of the influential German National Association of Commercial Employees, which had previously favored a coalition between the National Socialists and the Centre Party.

The KVP viewed Adolf Hitler and his program with uncertainty. It was not clear to them what a term like &quot;Third Reich&quot; was supposed to mean. Even on 18 February 1933, when Hitler was already chancellor, they were still saying that a fascist experiment could not last long and that the only possible form of government for Germany in the future would be an authoritarian state. The crisis of the KVP was clearly reflected in the contradictory recommendations that were issued for the Reichstag elections on March 5. Some were for the Combat Front Black-White-Red made up of the DNVP and its paramilitary wing the Stahlhelm, and some for the Christian Social People&#x27;s Service and indirectly also for the National Socialists.

On 31 March 1933, the KVP folded due to lack of funds, and Heinz Dähnhardt destroyed the party&#x27;s archives on 1 May 1933. Like all other remaining parties, the KVP was banned by law on 14 July 1933. Treviranus fled abroad in mid-1934.

== Program ==
The Conservative People&#x27;s Party called for an end to the &quot;system of disorderly mass rule, by means of a state structured in accordance with the historical development and natural segmentation of the people&quot;. What was meant by this was a constitution oriented around occupational class.

In its 1930 election appeal, the KVP advocated a nationalist but moderate foreign policy, calling for a revision of &quot;tribute burdens&quot; (First World War reparations), a referendum for the three cantons known as Eupen-Malmedy that had been ceded to Belgium at the end of the war, the return to Germany of the Saar basin, also lost in the war, and a new border in the East. In domestic policy, the party wanted an unspecified reform of functions at the federal and state level, a strengthening of local self-government, and secure positions for public servants. Instead of &quot;party and program elections&quot;, &quot;elections of individuals&quot; were to be introduced.

Economically, the KVP wanted to see a &quot;viable market&quot; and independent trade that was to be protected from competition and nationalization. Occupational-class structures were to be expanded. Culture promoted by the state had to be &quot;consistent with the principles of the Christian doctrines of salvation and morality&quot;.

== Structure ==
The People&#x27;s Conservative Association and then the People&#x27;s Conservative Party had a national office in Berlin. According to its statutes of 17 December 1930, the KVP had a 25-member Reich Executive Committee that was elected for a two-year term. It in turn elected the eleven-member Reich Executive Board which included the party chairman and the editor of the party newspaper (People&#x27;s Conservative Voices). A member of the executive committee had responsibility for day-to-day management. The first chairman was Treviranus, then from December 15 Paul Lejeune-Jung. After he resigned in 1932, Heinz Dähnhardt took over management. The KVP had little presence in the German states.

The People&#x27;s Conservative Association, which was temporarily revived alongside the KVP, adopted a charter in 1931 according to which it strove for &quot;the political unification of all forces&quot; that were &quot;determined to fight for a free, vigorously led German state in the spirit of the &#x27;Conservative Manifesto&#x27; of 15 February 1931&quot;. Any German could become a member. The general meeting, the &quot;Conservative Reich Convention&quot;, elected a &quot;Leadership Ring&quot; for two years, which chose a speaker. Reichstag and Landtag (state parliament) deputies were not allowed to be members, but instead belonged to a &quot;Parliamentary Ring&quot;.

Beginning in 1930, the association published a series of People&#x27;s Conservative pamphlets and, for its employees, the People&#x27;s Conservative Leadership Letters. In addition, the People&#x27;s Conservatives had contacts with the newspapers and the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.

== Significance ==
The Conservative People&#x27;s Party saw itself as the core of a movement around which the bourgeoisie could crystallize. That, however, did not happen, and the organization remained a party without a mass following or a party apparatus worth mentioning. In particular, unlike the DNVP, it lacked the support of the agrarian interest groups in the conservative strongholds of eastern Prussia. In 1930, it had just 10,000 members. It received considerable financial support from industry, which rejected Hugenberg&#x27;s anti-governmental policies.

In elections, the party remained largely unsuccessful. In the Reichstag elections of 1930, it won four seats through a combined list with the (Farmers&#x27; Party). But even in that election, it gained only about 300,000 votes, or 0.8% of the votes cast. It achieved its only mandate at the state level in 1930, in the parliamentary elections in Bremen. The attempt to unite the bourgeois parties, including the KVP, failed in 1932, as the result of which the KVP did not run in the 1932 Reichstag elections. That marked the end of its meaningful political activity.

<text>The black-necked weaver (Ploceus nigricollis) is a resident breeding bird species in much of central Africa from Cameroon in the west to Kenya and southern Somalia in the east.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The species was formally described in 1805 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot, who named it &quot;Malimbus nigricollis&quot;. The description was based on a specimen that had been collected near Malimbe, now Malembo, in the Cabinda Province of Angola. The species epithet &quot;nigricollis&quot; combines the Latin words Latin words, &quot;niger&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;collis&quot; meaning &quot;necked&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===
There are two subspecies recognized:
* &quot;P. n. nigricollis&quot; – : Found from eastern Cameroon to southern Sudan, western Kenya, north-western Tanzania, southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. Also on the island of on Bioko
* &quot;P. n. melanoxanthus&quot; – : Found from southern Ethiopia and southern Somalia to central and eastern Kenya and north-eastern Tanzania

The black-necked weaver was formerly considered to be conspecific with the olive-naped weaver. The two species differ in plumage and in the colour of the iris. A molecular study published in 2019 found that the two species are genetically very similar.

== Description ==
The black-necked weaver is a stocky 16 cm bird with a strong conical bill. The adult male of the northern race has olive upper-parts and wings, and yellow underparts and head. It has a black eye-mask and bib, and a pale yellow iris. The non-breeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upper-parts and whitish. The wings remain yellow and black.

The adult female also has olive upper-parts and wings, and yellow underparts and head. It has a black eyemask but no bib.

The southern race found from Nigeria eastwards has a quite different appearance, with almost black upper-parts and tail.

The black-necked weaver feeds on insects and vegetable matter. The calls of this bird include a wheezing &quot;dew-dew-twee&quot; .

==Distribution and habitat==
This weaver occurs in forests, especially in wet habitats.

==Behaviour and ecology==
It builds a large coarsely woven nest made of grass and creepers with a 15 cm downward facing entrance tunnel hanging from the globular egg chamber. The nest is suspended from a branch in a tree and 2-3 eggs are laid. It nests in pairs but forms small flocks when not breeding.

<doc id="708701" wikidata="Q224689" url="?curid=708701" title="Saigyō">
<text>was a Japanese poet of the late Heian and early Kamakura period.

==Biography==
Born in Kyoto to a noble family, he lived during the traumatic transition of power between the old court nobles and the new samurai warriors. After the start of the age of Mappō, Buddhism was considered to be in decline and no longer as effective a means of salvation. These cultural shifts during his lifetime led to a sense of melancholy in his poetry. As a youth, he worked as a guard to retired Emperor Toba, but in 1140 at age 22, for reasons now unknown, he quit worldly life to become a monk, taking the religious name .

He later took the pen name , meaning &quot;Western Journey&quot;, a reference to Amida Buddha and the Western paradise. He lived alone for long periods in his life in Saga, Mt. Koya, Mt. Yoshino, Ise, and many other places, but he is more known for the many long, poetic journeys he took to Northern Honshū that would later inspire Bashō in his &quot;Narrow Road to the Interior&quot;.

He was a good friend of Fujiwara no Teika.

 is Saigyō&#x27;s personal poetry collection. Other collections that include poems by Saigyō are the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot; and the &quot;Shika Wakashū&quot;.

He died at Hirokawa Temple in Kawachi Province (present-day Osaka Prefecture) at age 72.

==Style==
In Saigyō&#x27;s time, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; was no longer a big influence on waka poetry, compared to the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;. Where the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; was concerned with subjective experience, word play, flow, and elegant diction (neither colloquial nor pseudo-Chinese), the &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot; (formed with poetry written by Saigyō and others writing in the same style) was less subjective, had fewer verbs and more nouns, was not as interested in word play, allowed for repetition, had breaks in the flow, was slightly more colloquial and more somber and melancholic. Due to the turbulent times, Saigyō focuses not just on &quot;mono no aware&quot; (sorrow from change) but also on &quot;sabi&quot; (loneliness) and &quot;kanashi&quot; (sadness). Though he was a Buddhist monk, Saigyō was still very attached to the world and the beauty of nature.

==Poetry examples==
Many of his best-known poems express the tension he felt between renunciatory Buddhist ideals and his love of natural beauty. Most monks would have asked to die facing West, to be welcomed by the Buddha, but Saigyō finds the Buddha in the flowers:

To be &quot;heartless&quot; was an ideal of Buddhist monkhood, meaning one had abandoned all desire and attachment:

Saigyō travelled extensively, but one of his favorite places was Mount Yoshino, famous for its cherry blossoms:

==Legacy==
* Saigyō&#x27;s journeys were an inspiration for the court lady Lady Nijō, who records in her &quot;Towazugatari&quot; that she dreamed of writing a similar travel book after reading Saigyō&#x27;s work at age 8. Nijō later followed in Saigyō&#x27;s footsteps when she became a Buddhist nun, visiting many of the places he recorded.
* Bashō subsequently looked back to Saigyō for artistic inspiration. For example, quoting Saigyō&#x27;s poem on the pine tree at Shiogoshi, he wrote &quot;Should anyone dare to write another poem on this pine tree, it would be like trying to add a sixth finger to his hand&quot;.

<text>Benjamin David Gillies (born 24 October 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the drummer of Australian rock band Silverchair from 1992 until the band went on hiatus in 2011. In 2003, Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr, initially as a songwriting project; they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia but subsequently folded. By June 2011, after Silverchair&#x27;s disbandment, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album, and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In 2012, he formed Bento, in which he performs lead vocals, and released the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Diamond Days&quot;.

==Career==
Benjamin David Gillies was born on 24 October 1979 in Merewether, a suburb of Newcastle. He started as a quad drummer in the band The Marching Koalas, before forming a grunge group, Innocent Criminals, at the age of 12 with friends Daniel Johns, Chris Joannou, and Tobin Finnane. Playing originally at school and other venues in the Newcastle area, they came to attention after a weekend music workshop at the Tanilba Bay Progress Hall funded through the Arts Council of New South Wales in March 1994. By October 1994, under their new name Silverchair, their first EP &quot;Tomorrow&quot; had reached No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Silverchair went on to release five No. 1 albums, &quot;Frogstomp&quot; (1995), &quot;Freak Show&quot; (1997), &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; (1999), &quot;Diorama&quot; (2002) and &quot;Young Modern&quot; (2007).

Gillies formed the band Tambalane in 2002 while Silverchair was in hiatus following Johns&#x27; illness, releasing a self-titled album featuring the singles &quot;Little Miss Liar&quot; and &quot;Free&quot; before the band folded in 2005. He then returned to work with Silverchair.

In May 2011, Silverchair announced an &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; and that they were not likely to work together &quot;in the foreseeable future&quot;. By June, Gillies was in the final stages of working on his solo album, he had been working on it for about 12 months and said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane.

In 2020, Gillies released the songs &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot; and &quot;One Foot in Front of The Other&quot;.

In 2021, Gillies released the song &quot;Yesteryear&quot; which became a track on his five-song EP &quot;The Relative Relatives&quot;. 

==Personal life==
In June 2010, Gillies married Jakica &#x27;Jackie&#x27; Ivancevic. His wife, known as Jackie Gillies, works as a professional psychic and featured on the TV series &quot;The Real Housewives of Melbourne&quot;. 

In February 2018, Gillies was charged with mid-range drunk driving. During an interview with the ABC&#x27;s Australian Story in September 2023, Ben revealed he had been dealing with anxiety ever since experiencing an acute psychotic break at the height of Silverchair&#x27;s fame, when his first ecstasy pill, combined with a heavy marijuana habit, &quot;pushed me over the edge&quot;.

He said he was able to beat his addictions, including heavy drinking, following an ultimatum from his wife Jackie.

In September 2020, Gillies was interviewed as a special guest on an episode of the &quot;Too Much of Not Enough&quot; Silverchair podcast, produced by Australian fan Daniel Hedger.

In October 2021, Gillies and his wife welcomed twin babies after multiple rounds of IVF. 

In 2023, Gilles and his wife competed on the seventh season of &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot;.

<text>Christopher John Joannou (born 10 November 1979) is a Macedonian-Australian musician best known as the bassist for the Newcastle-based alternative rock band Silverchair. He is a twin to sister Louise Kipa. He was the first of the three band members to cut his long hair short. Joannou was nicknamed &#x27;Lumberjack&#x27; by Silverchair fans for his love of trees, and plaid shirts.

As well as being a well known bassist, Joannou was the assistant producer for The Mess Hall albums &quot;Feeling Sideways&quot; and the ARIA award-winning &quot;Notes From A Ceiling&quot;.

He has used mainly G&amp;L and Fender Precision Basses, and almost exclusively uses Ampeg B-15 Portaflex combos. As reported to gearwire.com, Joannou uses an Ampeg SVT-2 into an Ampeg 810 cabinet and a new Ampeg B-15 combo in his live set-up.

In 2006, Joannou spoke at the launch of a mental health scholarship set up to honour his cousin, Nathan Trepezanov, who died by suicide at the age of 21 in January of that year. Joannou is of Macedonian heritage.

== Business ventures ==

Joannou is a co-founder and co-owner of the Lovells Lager beer company. He is also one of four businessmen who opened a bar and small entertainment venue on Parry Street in the West End of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, which opened in December 2013.

<doc id="708715" wikidata="Q837999" url="?curid=708715" title="Novitiate">
<text>The novitiate, also called the noviciate, is the period of training and preparation that a Christian &quot;novice&quot; (or &quot;prospective&quot;) monastic, apostolic, or member of a religious order undergoes prior to taking vows in order to discern whether they are called to vowed religious life. It often includes times of intense study, prayer, living in community, studying the vowed life, deepening one&#x27;s relationship with God, and deepening one&#x27;s self-awareness. The canonical time of the novitiate is one year; in case of additional length, it must not be extended over two years. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the novitiate is officially set at three years before one may be tonsured a monk or nun, though this requirement may be waived. The novitiate is in any case a time both for the novice to get to know the community and the community to get to know the novice. The novice should aspire to deepening their relationship to God and discovering the community&#x27;s charism. The novitiate in many communities includes a concentrated program of prayer, study, reflection and limited ministerial engagement.

The novitiate, through which life in an institute is begun, is arranged so that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.
:—CIC, can. 646

In some novitiate communities, mostly monastic, the novice often wears clothing that is distinct from secular dress but is not the full habit worn by professed members of the community. The novices&#x27; day normally includes participation in the canonical hours, manual labor, and classes about the religious life. Spiritual exercises and tests of humility are common features of a novitiate.

A superior should ideally appoint an experienced member of the community to serve as novice master or mistress.

Different religious communities have varying requirements for the duration of the novitiate. The novice must complete a postulancy before being admitted to the novitiate, the duration of which can be short or extend up to three years.

A novice is free to leave the novitiate at any time and in most communities, the superiors are free to dismiss them with or without cause. At the end of the novitiate, the novices are either admitted to temporary vows or asked to leave. The binding, life-long commitment to consecrated life comes at a later point.

The term &quot;novitiate&quot; also refers to the building, house, or complex devoted to the novices&#x27; cells or dormitory and other needs, such as study and education.

<text>Riverside Geyser is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.

The geyser is located on the Firehole River within the Upper Geyser Basin. The geyser shoots steam and water to heights of 75 feet (23 m) in an arch over the river, sometimes causing rainbows. The eruptions occur every 51⁄2 to 7 hours. As is Old Faithful, Riverside is one of the most predictable geysers in the park, because it is not located near any other geysers that may disrupt the flow of underground water in the geyser&#x27;s plumbing. Riverside is unique in its way that eruptions seldom occur at the average interval for any given time. Instead, Riverside is bimodal, meaning it usually erupts 20 minutes before or 25 minutes late for a duration of 20 minutes. For an hour or two before the eruption, water pours over the edge of the cone. The geyser was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.

The geyser is one of the most reliable geysers in Yellowstone, despite the moniker and reputation of the better-known Old Faithful.

<text>Geelong Airport was a small airfield specifically for light aircraft located in Mount Duneed, Victoria, Australia. It was primarily used for scenic flights and private aircraft, and was located in the local government area of the City of Greater Geelong.

The airport contained two gravel/tarmac runways: north/south and east/west. Though commercial airlines had attempted to fly services to Geelong in the past, they chose to use the more developed airport at Avalon, located to the north side of Melbourne. Operations from Avalon also proved to be unsuccessful. Other airports in the area are at Barwon Heads , the Torquay Airport and the &quot;Tiger Moth World&quot; at 325 Blackgate Rd.

The site is also used to record wind and weather measurements for the area. Geelong airport was sold to property developers to allow for the expansion of the urban sprawl of Geelong. The airport closed on 31 December 2011.

Since 2011 closure and later redevelopment, only the former office building and a hangar remained. While the hangar has been retained for future use, the office building, although repainted, was allowed to decay and became a target for vandalism. On 10 September 2022, a suspicious fire damaged the office building beyond repair. It was demolished a month later.

<text>A novice is a person who has entered a religious order and is under probation, before taking vows. A &quot;novice&quot; can also refer to a person (or animal e.g. racehorse) who is entering a profession with no prior experience.

==Religion==
===Buddhism===


In many Buddhist orders, a man or woman who intends to take ordination must first become a novice, adopting part of the monastic code indicated in the vinaya and studying in preparation for full ordination. The name for this level of ordination varies from one tradition to another. In Pali, the word is samanera, which means &#x27;small monk&#x27; or &#x27;boy monk&#x27;.

===Christianity===
====Catholicism====

A novice in Catholic canon law and tradition is a prospective member of a religious order who is being tried and assessed for suitability of admission to a religious order of priests, religious brothers, or religious sisters, whether the community is one of monks or has an apostolate. After initial contact with the community, and usually a period of time as a postulant (a period of candidacy in which the aspirant lives with the community), the person will be received as a novice in a ceremony that most often involves being clothed with the religious habit (traditional garb) of the particular religious community. The novice&#x27;s habit is often slightly different from those of professed members of the order. For instance, in communities of women that wear a black veil, novices often wear a white one, sometimes, for example among the Trappists, also a white scapular instead of the black of the professed; among Franciscan communities of men, novices wear an additional shirt-like chest piece over the traditional Franciscan robe; Carthusian novices wear a dark cloak over the usual white habit; etc.

Novices are not admitted to vows until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the novitiate. This usually lasts at least one year, the minimum required by Canon Law, though in some orders and communities it is two. Novices typically have cells or a dormitory in separate areas within a monastery or community and are under the direct supervision of a novice master or novice mistress.

====Lutheranism====
In communities belonging to the Lutheran Churches, the period of the novitiate starts after postulancy. In the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, this period lasts for a minimum of five years.

====Anglicanism====
In Anglicanism, the novitiate is the period of time where a novice is trained as a member of the religious order or monastery.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a candidate may be clothed as a novice (Slavonic: послушник, &quot;poslushnik&quot;, literally &quot;one under obedience&quot;) by the hegumen (abbot) or hegumenia (abbess) after at least three days in the monastery. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he or she is simply given the riassa, belt and skoufos. Novice nuns additionally wear a veil (apostolnik) that covers the head and neck. A novice is also given a prayer rope and instructed in the use of the Jesus Prayer. In large communities, the new novice may be assigned a starets (spiritual father or spiritual mother) who will guide his (or her) spiritual development. Frequent confession of sins and participation in the sacred mysteries (sacraments) of the church is an important part of Orthodox monastic life.

A novice is free to leave the monastery at any time, and the superior is free to dismiss the novice at any time if, for instance, they feel that the novice is not called to monasticism or if there have been issues of discipline. If, however, the novice perseveres, after a period of around three years, the hegumen may choose to clothe them in the first (beginning) rank of monasticism: the rassaphore.

===Mandaeism===

In Mandaeism, novices who are being initiated into the Mandaean priesthood are called &quot;šualia&quot; ().

==Sports==
In National Hunt racing, a novice is a horse that has not won a race under a particular code (either chasing or hurdling) before the current season.

In figure skating competitions, novice has two meanings. For the U.S. Figure Skating Association, it refers to a skill level, while the International Skating Union uses it to designate age.

Novice is a level of minor hockey in Canada. Novice players are usually between the ages of 7 and 8.

In the sport of crew (rowing), the term is used for an athlete in their first year of competition.

In many sports, a novice athlete competing in their first season or league is often referred to as a rookie, and outstanding novice athletes can win Rookie of the Year.

==Online communities==
With the rise of the internet, a &quot;novice&quot; could be a person who is a newcomer to a particular website, forum, or other social community. These people are usually inexperienced and unfamiliar with the traditions and protocols surrounding that community.

Generally derogatory slang terms include &quot;newbie&quot; and the more derogatory &quot;noob&quot;. Newbie is mostly used as a descriptor or qualifier, a name given to novices by more experienced users or community members to indicate someone who just entered the community and is eager to learn and participate. Noob is a word used to insult or deride novices who are disrespectful, uninterested, or unwilling to learn.

In gamer culture, a newbie is an inexperienced player with a low level, rank, or in-game abilities but wants to participate and improve, and a noob is a bad player who seems disinterested in learning or teamwork and trolls other players.

=== Dealing with newcomers === 
Online communities have five basic problems regarding newcomers: recruitment, selection, retention, socialization, and protection.

Recruitment in online communities is about advertising to recruits and ensuring there is a healthy amount of newcomers because without newcomers, online communities can fail to survive. There many different methods that online communities use to recruit new members. For example, Blizzard entertainment used both impersonal advertisement (TV, print, online advertisement) and interpersonal advertisement (recruit-a-friend promotion) to recruit new players for World of Warcraft.

Selection in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers will be a good fit in the community. This is very important because a better fit is more likely to be beneficial for the community, since better fit newcomers stay in the group longer when they join and are more satisfied with their membership. One way that selection works in online communities is through the process of self-selection, in which the potential members decide themselves to join a community based on the information about the community available to them. Another way of selection is through screening, in which the community selects certain members who they believe will be a good fit.

Retention in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers stick around and stay long enough to become more committed members, who take on more important responsibilities and begin to be identify themselves with the group. One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment. For example, in World of Warcraft, newcomers have to play with other guild members for at least about a month to join.

Socialization in online communities about the rest of community interacting with newcomer and teaching them the guidelines and standards of the community. For example, in World of Warcraft, old member show the newcomers ropes, by coaching them, helping them with quests, and providing mentorship in general.

Protection in online communities is about protecting the community from the newcomers. Since newcomers still have not established themselves with the group or still may be unfamiliar with the norms of the community, the rest of the community has to beware of the potential damage that they can cause. One way to deal with the threats is through the use of sandboxes, which allows newcomers to try out the features and learn about the tools without causing damage to the community.
