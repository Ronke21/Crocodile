<text>Manuel Francisco dos Santos (28 October 1933 – 20 January 1983), nicknamed Mané Garrincha, best known as simply Garrincha (, &quot;little bird&quot;), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a right winger. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and by many, one of the greatest dribblers ever.

Garrincha played a vital role in Brazil&#x27;s 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. In 1962, when Pelé was injured, Garrincha led Brazil to a World Cup victory with a dominating performance throughout the tournament. He also became the first player to win the Golden Ball (Player of the tournament), Golden Boot (Leading Goalscorer) and the World Cup in the same tournament. He was also named in the World Cup All-Star Teams of both 1958 World Cup and 1962 World Cup. In 1994, he was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Garrincha and Pelé. In 1999, he came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote. He is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century, and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Hall of Fame. Due to his immense popularity in Brazil, he was also called &quot;Alegria do Povo&quot; (People&#x27;s Joy) and &quot;Anjo de Pernas Tortas&quot; (Bent-Legged Angel).

At club level, Garrincha played the majority of his professional career for the Brazilian team Botafogo. In the Maracanã Stadium, the home team room is known as &quot;Garrincha&quot;. In the capital Brasília, the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha is named after him. He is credited for inspiring the first bullfighting chants of olé to be used at football grounds.

== Early life ==

Garrincha was born in Pau Grande, a district of Magé, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. He was born with his right leg 6 centimetres shorter than his left, also his left leg turned outwards and his right turned inwards, leading one doctor to certify him as crippled as a child.

His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit. A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as small as a little bird she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird. The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends. Garrincha was also known as Mané (short for &quot;Manuel&quot;) by his friends. The combined &quot;Mané Garrincha&quot; is common among fans in Brazil.

Garrincha was known amongst footballing scouts but did not arrive in professional football until his late teens; he had no interest in a professional career despite his immense talent.

Garrincha&#x27;s younger brother, Jimmy dos Santos, played 20 games for Série A side CR Vasco da Gama in 1959.

== Club career ==

Garrincha was already married and a parent when he signed for Botafogo in 1953. Team officials were ecstatic to learn that he was over 18 and able to be treated as a professional. In his first training session, he demonstrated his extraordinary skills by dribbling the ball through the legs of Nílton Santos, a Brazilian international defender and defensive midfielder who had 16 international caps. Santos was so impressed with the young Garrincha, he asked that Botafogo sign him. He played in a 5–0 win for Botafogo&#x27;s reserves and then scored a hat trick on his first-team début against Bonsucesso on 19 July 1953.

Garrincha continued to play brilliantly, but Brazil had other talented players in his position, notably Julinho and together with a new European style of play centered on teamwork, he was not named in the squad for the 1954 World Cup. He helped Botafogo win the Campeonato Carioca in 1957 by scoring 20 goals in 26 games finishing second in the league scoring charts and this convinced the national team selectors to name him to the 1958 World Cup squad. After the 1962 World Cup, Garrincha returned to Rio and carried Botafogo to victory in the 1962 &quot;Campeonato Carioca&quot; final against Flamengo. Garrincha played for Botafogo for 12 years, the bulk of his professional career. He won the &quot;Campeonato Carioca&quot; three times with them, scored 232 goals in 581 matches, and became a symbol of the history of the club.

In 1966, with his career declining, he was sold to Corinthians. Two years later, he signed for Colombian team Atlético Junior. The same year he went back to Brazil and joined Flamengo, where he would stay until 1969. In 1971, there were rumours that Garrincha, 38, would join French club Red Star, but he never signed and stayed in Brazil.

An entertainer renowned for his dribbling skills in taking on opposing players, Garrincha inspiring the first bullfighting chants of olé to be used at football grounds; during a 1958 club game for Botafogo he gave a footballing lesson to River Plate defender Vairo, constantly teasing, feinting and going past him to ole&#x27;s from the crowd, and when he &quot;forgot&quot; the ball and sprinted away with Vairo running after him the chants of olés changed to laughter. Garrincha&#x27;s professional career as a footballer lasted until 1972, when he played for Olaria, but he played occasional exhibition matches until 1982.

Garrincha was subject to numerous transfer attempts by rich European clubs like Juventus of Turin, Italy who tried to sign him in 1954. Real Madrid of Spain tried to sign him in 1959 after some stunning performances by him on a tour of Europe. Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus of Italy considered jointly signing him in 1963 (he would have to spend a season with each); a deal that would have been unique in football.

== International career ==
Garrincha played 50 international matches for Brazil between 1955 and 1966, and was a starter for the national team in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 World Cups. Brazil lost only one match with him on the pitch, against Hungary at the 1966 World Cup. This was the last time Garrincha played in National team. Pelé did not play the game against Hungary, and thus Brazil never lost when Garrincha and Pelé were in the same lineup.

His first cap was against Chile in Rio de Janeiro in 1955. He played two matches at the Copa América of 1957 and four in the 1959 edition, Brazil finished runners up in both editions.

=== 1958 World Cup ===

On 29 May, ten days before the 1958 World Cup finals started, Garrincha scored one of his most famous goals, against Fiorentina in Italy. He beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, before stopping on the goal line. Rather than kicking the ball into the open goal, he then dribbled past the returning Enzo Robotti to score. Despite his stunning performance his coaches were upset at what they considered an irresponsible move and this likely led to Garrincha not being picked for Brazil&#x27;s first two matches of the 1958 tournament. However, he did start their third match against the USSR; this match marked the debut of both Garrincha and Pelé (although Garrincha was seven years older than Pele, both being born in October, respectively in 1933 and in 1940). The Soviets were one of the favourites for the tournament, and the Brazilians had been nervous about playing them. Their manager, Vicente Feola, decided to attack directly from the kickoff. Garrincha received the ball on the right wing, beat three opposing players and took a shot which hit the post. With the match still less than a minute old, he set up a chance for Pelé, who hit the crossbar, and continually caused problems for the Soviet defence. Brazil were so impressive in the opening moments that the game&#x27;s start is often referred to as &quot;the best three minutes of football of all time&quot;. Brazil won the match 2–0.

Following the Brazilians&#x27; narrow 1–0 quarter-final win against Wales on 19 June 1958, Mel Hopkins (the fullback who faced him that game) described Garrincha as &quot;a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too.&quot;

In the final against Sweden, Brazil fell behind 0–1 early, but rapidly equalized after Garrincha went past his marker on the right wing and sent a cross for Vavá to score. Before the end of the first half, Garrincha made a similar play, again setting up Vavá to make the score 2–1. Brazil ended winning the match and its first World Cup trophy, with Garrincha being one of the best players of the tournament; he was voted to the &quot;Best XI&quot; for the competition.

Garrincha never bothered about the &#x27;details&#x27; of the game. As his teammates were celebrating the World Cup win, he was initially bemused, having been under the impression that the competition was more league-like and that Brazil would play all the other teams twice.

=== 1958–1962 ===
Garrincha put on weight after the World Cup, partly because of his drinking, so he was dropped from the national team for a friendly match in Rio against England on 13 May 1959. Later that month, he went on tour with Botafogo in Sweden and got a local girl pregnant. When he returned to Brazil, he drove home to Pau Grande and ran over his father, Amaro. He drove off without stopping, with an angry mob chasing him, and when they caught up with him they found him &quot;drunk, almost catatonic, and with no grasp of what he had done.&quot; In August, his wife, Nair, gave birth to their fifth child, and his mistress Iraci announced her first pregnancy. His father died of liver cancer on 10 October having been dependent on alcohol for years.

=== 1962 World Cup ===

Garrincha was the most outstanding player of the 1962 FIFA World Cup. When Pelé suffered an injury after the second match and was sidelined for the rest of the tournament, Garrincha played a leading role in Brazil&#x27;s triumph, excelling particularly against England and Chile, scoring 4 goals in those two matches.

After one win and one draw, Brazil faced Spain, without Pelé. The South Americans were losing 0–1 in the second half. Amarildo, Pelé&#x27;s substitute for the remainder of the tournament, scored the equalizer. Five minutes before the end, Garrincha took the ball on the right flank, dribbled past a defender and paused. Then he dribbled past the same man and another defender, and sent a cross to Amarildo, who scored again to win the match.

In the quarter-finals against England, Garrincha opened the score with a header off a corner kick. England equalized before half time. In the second half, Vavá scored Brazil&#x27;s second goal off a rebound of a shot by Garrincha; minutes later, Garrincha received a ball outside the penalty area, paused, and sent a curved shot – known as the &quot;banana shot&quot; – into the bottom of the net. Brazil won 3–1 and advanced to the semi-finals. The British football press said he &quot;was Stanley Matthews, Tom Finney and a snake charmer all rolled into one.&quot;

During the quarter final, a stray dog ran onto the pitch and evaded all of the players&#x27; efforts to catch it until England striker Jimmy Greaves got down on all fours to beckon the animal. Though successful in catching the dog, it managed to urinate all over Greaves&#x27; England shirt. Greaves claimed that Garrincha thought the incident was so amusing that he took the dog home as a pet. Ruy Castro&#x27;s book expands upon this, by clarifying that the dog was captured by an official, and raffled off to the Brazilian squad, a raffle which Garrincha won. The dog was named &quot;Bi&quot; (from &quot;bi-campeões&quot; - &quot;two times champions&quot;).

He scored two more goals in the semi-final against the hosts, Chile, as Brazil went on to win 4–2. His first goal was a 20-yard left-foot shot; the second one, a header. A subsequent headline in the Chilean newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot; read: &quot;What planet is Garrincha from?&quot; Garrincha was sent off in that match after 83 minutes for retaliating after being continually fouled. However, he was not suspended for the following match.

Brazil faced Czechoslovakia in the final. Garrincha played despite suffering from a severe fever, which did not prevent Brazil from winning 3–1 and him from getting voted player of the tournament. It was the second consecutive World Cup won by Garrincha and Brazil.

=== 1966 World Cup ===
Though well short of match fitness and still struggling with a knee injury, which would plague him for the rest of his career, Garrincha still played in the first match of the tournament, a 2–0 win against Bulgaria, Garrincha scored one of the goals of this game with a free kick taken with the outside of his foot (the second goal of this game was scored by Pelé - this was the only time when Garrincha and Pelé both scored goals in the same game). Then Brazil lost 1–3 to Hungary at Goodison Park, in Garrincha&#x27;s last ever international match, which was the only time Garrincha lost a match with the Brazil national team; he did not play in the last match of the first round against Portugal. Brazil were eliminated in the first round.

=== Retirement from professional football and farewell ===
In 1973, although he was still signed by Olaria, Garrincha decided to leave professional football. Apart from his age (he was already 40), &quot;there was another reason for wanting to retire: he had become a grandfather for the first time – his daughter Edenir had just given birth to Alexandra – and being a professional football player and a grandfather felt weird.&quot; Alexandra with her three children still live in Garrincha&#x27;s house in Pau Grande.

On 19 December 1973, a farewell match for Garrincha between a FIFA World team and Brazil was celebrated at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, in front of 131,000 spectators. The FIFA team was composed mainly of Argentine and Uruguayan players, while Brazil fielded Pelé, Carlos Alberto, and several other members of the 1970 World Cup winning squad. Garrincha started the match, and while in the first half, at a point when Brazil had the ball in attack, the referee stopped the match so Garrincha could leave the pitch and receive the crowd&#x27;s respects. Garrincha then did a lap around the pitch before disappearing through the stadium&#x27;s tunnel.

== Final years and death ==

The success Garrincha enjoyed on the football pitch was in stark contrast to his personal life. He drank heavily throughout his adult life and was involved in several serious road accidents, notably a crash into a lorry in April 1969 which killed his mother-in-law. He was married twice, first to Nair Marques in 1952 (they separated in 1965), a factory worker from Pau Grande with whom he had eight daughters, and second to Elza Soares, a samba singer whom he married in an unofficial ceremony in March 1966. Soares had also been married previously, and the marriage saw Garrincha cast as a villain by the same press that had once feted him. The couple separated in 1977, when Soares left him after he struck her during an argument. Garrincha had other significant affairs, including one with showgirl Angelita Martinez, and he is known to have fathered at least 14 children.

After a series of financial and marital problems, Garrincha died of cirrhosis of the liver on 20 January 1983, in an alcoholic coma in Rio de Janeiro. He had been hospitalized eight times in the previous year, and by the time of his death he was a physical and mental wreck. His last years were unhappy and obscure – he seemed to have become a forgotten hero – but his funeral procession, from the Maracanã to Pau Grande, drew millions of fans, friends and former players to pay their respects. His epitaph reads &quot;Here rests in peace the one who was the Joy of the People – Mané Garrincha.&quot; People had painted on the wall: &quot;Obrigado, Garrincha, por você ter vivido&quot; (Thank you, Garrincha, for having lived).

A multi-use stadium in Brasília, the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha, is named after him. His career was presented in the 1962 film &quot;&quot;, and in 2003, another movie, called &quot;Garrincha – Estrela Solitária&quot; (&quot;Lonely Star&quot;), based on Ruy Castro&#x27;s book, depicted his life on and off the field.
== Style of play ==
An explosive, agile, and diminutive right winger with a low centre of gravity, Garrincha is renowned for his creativity, pace, and speed of execution, as well as his remarkable ball control, technique, flair, imagination, dribbling skills and feints on the wing, which enabled him to create chances out of nothing. Capable of both scoring goals and creating chances for teammates, he also possessed a powerful shot with either foot and was a gifted crosser and set piece specialist known for his bending free kicks and corners taken with the outside of his foot. However, it was his dribbling skills he was most famous for, a skill he retained throughout his career. Regarding Garrincha&#x27;s dribbling ability, football writer Scott Murray remarked when writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010: &quot;...the bottom line is uncontestable: Garrincha was the greatest dribbler ever.&quot;

Adored by the Brazilian public due to his innocence, carefree attitude and ability to entertain in making fools of opposing players, Garrincha was referred to as &quot;Joy of the People&quot;. Djalma Santos, his Brazil teammate, stated, &quot;He had a childish spirit. Garrincha was football&#x27;s answer to Charlie Chaplin.&quot;

Examples of his shooting ability are his goals in World Cups against England in 1962 and Bulgaria in 1966. He was also able to turn on himself at top speed and explode at unusual angles, which he used to great effect. The numerous attacks and goal opportunities he generated through individual plays would often end up in an accurate pass to a teammate in a position to score. This occurred in the first two of Brazil&#x27;s goals in the 1958 World Cup final and the second goal against Spain in the 1962 tournament. He was also an excellent header of the ball despite his relatively short stature. He is one of a few players to have scored direct from a corner, a feat he managed to do 4 times in his career.

Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was voted into the World Team of the 20th Century by 250 of the world&#x27;s most respected football writers and journalists, came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team.

<doc id="700578" wikidata="Q6292573" url="?curid=700578" title="José Jiménez (character)">
<text>José Jiménez was a fictional character created and performed by comedian Bill Dana on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1959 and who became increasingly popular during the 1960s. This character introduced himself with the catch phrase: &quot;My name...José Jiménez&quot;. Dana played José in three non-variety shows: &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;, which spun off &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot;, and a cameo in an episode of &quot;Batman&quot; (&quot;The Yegg Foes in Gotham&quot;, October 20, 1966).

==Astronaut==
During the course of his José Jiménez acts, Bill Dana (who was of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry, unlike the Bolivian character he played) took his character through various roles including elevator operator, sailor, and submariner until settling into the most famous occupation that José would hold: astronaut. An excerpt from &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;José Jiménez: &quot;My name... José Jiménez.&quot;
Ed Sullivan: &quot;Well, now I see you have some of your space equipment with you. Uh, what is that called, the crash helmet?&quot;
José Jiménez: &quot;Oh, I hope not.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;Ed Sullivan: &quot;Now, what do you consider the most important thing in rocket travel?&quot;
José Jiménez: &quot;To me the most important thing in the rocket travel is the blast-off.&quot;
Ed Sullivan: &quot;The blast-off.&quot;
José Jiménez: &quot;I always take a blast before I take off. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t go near that thing.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The routine was later released as a double-sided single: &quot;The Astronaut (Part 1 and 2)&quot; made the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, peaking at #19 in September 1961. Writer/producer Don Hinkley (who Dana had met when they were writers for the Allen show) played the part of the newscaster, asking José questions about his purported spaceflight. An LP, &quot;José Jiminez in Orbit (Bill Dana on Earth)&quot; (Kapp KL-1257), featuring similar routines, was issued in 1962.

The character of José Jiménez caught on with the seven real Mercury astronauts, and Dana became good friends with them: &quot;Okay, José, you&#x27;re on your way!&quot; Deke Slayton quipped as Alan Shepard&#x27;s famous first flight launched. José became the program&#x27;s unofficial mascot, and Dana was even made an honorary Mercury astronaut. (Coincidentally, there was a real test pilot named Bill Dana, who flew as high as 59 miles up and qualified for NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Badge.)

==Decline==
As time passed, Dana realized that such ethnic humor was becoming offensive, and Hispanic groups began protesting Dana&#x27;s portrayal of the dim-witted Hispanic character. In 1970, Dana announced to a Mexican-American cultural pride festival that &quot;after tonight, José Jiménez is dead&quot;, later holding a mock funeral for José on Sunset Boulevard. In 1997, Dana received an image award from the National Hispanic Media Coalition.

== José Jiménez in popular culture ==
In the 1983 film &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Alan Shepard (played by Scott Glenn) is a fan of the character and uses the catchphrase in radio talk while piloting his airplane in for a carrier landing. Later he is warned by a very large, rather intimidating Hispanic medical aide (played by Anthony Muñoz) that the way he uses it is offending people, and he stops. Footage of the character&#x27;s appearance as an astronaut on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was also seen in the film.

In the 1987 film &quot;The Pink Chiquitas&quot;, one of the characters reads a passage from a book describing an expedition by the &quot;explorer&quot; José Jiménez.

In his demo of the song &quot;Wonderful Toys&quot; written for the aborted Batman musical, Jim Steinman does a parody of Eminem, which includes the lines &quot;My name is—my name is—my names is—José Jiménez!&quot;. The song is meant to be sung by The Joker.

In the &quot;Farscape&quot; season 4 episode, &quot;Unrealized Reality&quot;, the lead character, John Crichton (who commonly quotes pop culture throughout his misadventures), experiences another possible reality of a scene from the first episode of the series. When asked his name, instead of saying John Crichton he replies, &quot;My name José Jiménez.&quot;

In the television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, the puppet character of Crow uses the phrase &quot;My name José Jiménez.&quot;

In the third episode of the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, called &quot;We Have Cleared the Tower&quot;, someone mentions Bill Dana during the Apollo 7 pre-launch breakfast. This inspires Commander Wally Schirra (played by Mark Harmon) to recite some of José Jiménez&#x27;s lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table.

In a cameo appearance in the &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode, &quot;Supersonic Boom&quot;, Dana alludes indirectly to Jiménez, in that his only line was &quot;Sorry fella, don&#x27;t speak Spanish. Boy, are you in the wrong neighborhood.&quot;

In season 4 episode 10 of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, Arthur argues that José had been an inspiration to children because he was the &quot;first Hispanic in space&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Day One&quot; of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, Kevin Arnold&#x27;s teacher calls him, &quot;a regular José Jiménez&quot; when Kevin interrupts a class lecture. Earlier in the episode Kevin made a joke and embarrassed the same teacher.

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, (season 3, episode 17), George Constanza goes to an unemployment office, where he nervously does an impression of José Jiménez.

Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham has performed with a pepper-shaped puppet named &quot;José Jalapeño,&quot; described as &quot;almost indistinguishable&quot; from José Jiménez.

<text>Exercise Tiger, or Operation Tiger, which took place in April 1944 on Slapton Sands in Devon, was one of a series of large-scale rehearsals for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Coordination and communication problems resulted in friendly fire injuries during the exercise, and an Allied convoy positioning itself for the landing was attacked by E-boats of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, resulting in the deaths of at least 749 American servicemen.

Because of the impending invasion of Normandy, the incident was under the strictest secrecy at the time and was only minimally reported afterwards.

==Exercise==
===Landing operations===
In late 1943, as part of the build-up to D-day, the British government set up a training ground at Slapton Sands, Devon, to be used by Force &quot;U&quot;, the American forces tasked with landing on Utah Beach. Slapton Beach was selected for its similarity to Utah Beach: a gravel beach, followed by a strip of land and then a lake. Approximately 3,000 local residents in the area of Slapton, now South Hams District of Devon, were evacuated. Some had never left their villages before being evacuated.

Landing exercises started in December 1943. Exercise Tiger was one of the larger exercises that took place in April and May 1944. The exercise was to last from 22 April until 30 April 1944, and covered all aspects of the invasion, culminating in a beach landing at Slapton Sands. On board nine large tank landing ships (LSTs), the 30,000 troops prepared for their mock landing, which also included a live-firing exercise.

Protection for the exercise area came from the Royal Navy. Four O-class destroyers, three Motor Torpedo Boats and two Motor Gun Boats patrolled the entrance to Lyme Bay while three Motor Torpedo Boats were stationed off Cherbourg, where German E-boats were based.

The first phase of the exercise focused on marshalling and embarkation drills, and lasted from 22 to 25 April. On the evening of 26 April the first wave of assault troops boarded their transports and set off, the plan being to simulate the Channel crossing by taking a roundabout route through Lyme Bay, in order to arrive off Slapton at first light on 27 April.

===Friendly fire incident===
The first practice assault took place on the morning of 27 April and was marked by an incident involving friendly fire. H-hour was set for 07:30, and was to include live ammunition to acclimatise the troops to the sights, sounds and even smells of a naval bombardment. During the landing itself, live rounds were to be fired over the heads of the incoming troops by forces on land, for the same reason. This followed an order made by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, who felt that the men must be hardened by exposure to real battle conditions. The exercise was to include naval bombardment by ships of Force U Bombardment Group fifty minutes prior to the landing.

Several of the landing ships for that morning were delayed, and the officer in charge, American Admiral Don P. Moon, decided to delay H-hour for 60 minutes, until 08:30. Some of the landing craft did not receive word of the change. Landing on the beach at their originally scheduled time, the second wave came under fire, suffering an unknown number of casualties. Rumours circulated among the fleet that as many as 450 men were killed.

==Battle of Lyme Bay==
On the day after the first practice assaults, early on the morning of 28 April, the exercise was blighted when Convoy T-4, consisting of eight LSTs carrying vehicles and combat engineers of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, was attacked by German E-boats in Lyme Bay. Nine German E-boats had left Cherbourg shortly after midnight, avoiding the British MTBs watching the port area and patrols in the English Channel.

Around 0130 hrs, six E-boats of the 5. S-Boot Flottille (5th E-Boat Flotilla) commanded by Korvettenkapitän Bernd Klug saw eight dark ships and split into three pairs to attack with torpedoes: first &quot;Rotte 3&quot; (&quot;S-136&quot; &amp; &quot;S-138&quot;), then &quot;Rotte 2&quot; under Oberleutnant zur See Goetschke (&quot;S-140&quot; &amp; &quot;S-142&quot;), then &quot;Rotte 1&quot; (&quot;S-100&quot; &amp; &quot;S-143&quot;). The final three E-boats of the nine, S-Boot Flottille commanded by Korvettenkapitän Götz Freiherr von Mirbach (&quot;S-130&quot;, &quot;S-145&quot; &amp; &quot;S-150&quot;), saw the red flares for attack (or may have heard the contact report sent at 0203 hrs) and joined the attack. Within the &quot;Rotte 1&quot; pair, &quot;S-100&quot; collided with &quot;S-143,&quot; damaged its superstructure, and the boats decided to leave, masking their retreat with smoke while sending another contact report. &quot;S-145&quot; attacked the ships with gunfire. The attack ended circa at 0330 hrs. The Germans had been puzzled by the strange-looking ships which did not look like merchantmen. They estimated that they were some type of American landing ship with a shallow draft as the initial torpedoes from &quot;Rotte 3&quot; and &quot;Rotte 2&quot; seemed to miss.

Of the two ships assigned to protect the convoy, only one was present. , a corvette, was leading the LSTs in a straight line, a formation that later drew criticism since it presented an easy target to the E-boats. The second ship that was supposed to be present, , a World War I destroyer, had been in a collision with an LST, suffered structural damage and left the convoy to be repaired at Plymouth. Because the LSTs and British naval headquarters were operating on different frequencies, the American forces did not know this. was dispatched as a replacement, but did not arrive in time to help protect the convoy.
===Casualties===
* was set on fire but eventually made it back to shore with the loss of 13 Navy personnel.
* was torpedoed and sunk with the loss of 202 US Army/US Navy personnel.
* was damaged by friendly fire from (intended to be directed at one of the E-boats which passed between the two LSTs) resulting in injuries to 18 US Army/Navy personnel.
* sank within six minutes of being torpedoed with the loss of 424 Army and Navy personnel.

The remaining ships and their escort fired back and the E-boats made no more attacks. In total, 749 servicemen (551 United States Army and 198 United States Navy) were killed during Exercise Tiger. Many servicemen drowned or died of hypothermia in the cold sea while waiting to be rescued. Many had not been shown how to put on their lifebelt correctly, and placed it around their waist, the only available spot because of their large backpacks. In some cases this meant that when they jumped into the water, the weight of their combat packs flipped them upside down, dragging their heads under water and drowning them. Dale Rodman, who travelled on &quot;LST-507&quot;, commented: &quot;The worst memory I have is setting off in the lifeboat away from the sinking ship and watching bodies float by&quot;. The 248 bodies that were recovered were sent to Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey on 29 April. The unit with the most casualties was the 1st Special Engineer Brigade.

==Aftermath==
===Operational consequences===
Vice Admiral Kirk of the US Navy immediately realised the huge damage E-boats could inflict on slow-moving landing craft with minimal defences and feared that the German success in Lyme Bay could be repeated on D-day, with disastrous consequences. On 4 May 1944 he sent a signal to Admiral Ramsay of the Royal Navy arguing for heavy aerial and naval bombardment of Cherbourg:
===Other consequences===
The attack was reported up the chain of command to Dwight D. Eisenhower on 29 April. Eisenhower was enraged that the convoy was sailing in a straight line and not zig-zagging, that the attack reduced reserves of LSTs, that it indicated to the Germans that the Allies were nearly ready to invade, and that ten American officers with knowledge of the invasion were missing. The missing officers had BIGOT-level clearance for D-Day, meaning that they knew the invasion plans and could have compromised the invasion should they have been captured alive. As a result, the invasion was nearly called off until the bodies of all ten victims were found. He ordered that all the officers&#x27; bodies, and any incriminating papers they might have had, be found. 

The ten American officers were from the 1st Engineer Special Brigade; they knew when and where the Utah and Omaha landings were to take place, and had seen the amphibious DUKWs that were to take the Rangers to below Pointe du Hoc. Merely knowing that exercises were taking place at Slapton was of interest to the Germans; the historian Stephen Ambrose suggests that the insistence in May by Hitler that the Normandy area be reinforced was because &quot;he noticed the similarity between Slapton Sands and the Cotentin beach&quot;.

There were reports that E-boats were nosing through the wreckage for information with searchlights or torches. The shore batteries around nearby Salcombe Harbour had visually spotted unidentified small craft, but were ordered not to fire on them as it would have shown the Germans that the harbour was defended and disclosed the battery position.

As a result of official embarrassment and concerns over potential leaks just prior to the real invasion, all survivors were sworn to secrecy about the events by their superiors. There is little information about exactly how individual soldiers and sailors died. The US Department of Defense stated in 1988 that record-keeping may have been inadequate aboard some of the ships, and the most pertinent log books were lost at sea. A ninth LST () was scheduled to be in the convoy, but was damaged. Author Nigel Lewis speculates that some or all of its infantrymen may have been aboard &quot;LST 507&quot; when it went down. Various eyewitness accounts detail hasty treatment of casualties and rumours circulated of unmarked mass graves in Devon fields.

Several changes resulted from mistakes made in Exercise Tiger:
# Radio frequencies were standardised; &quot;Azalea&quot; and &quot;Scimitar&quot; were late and out of position due to radio problems, and a signal about the E-boats&#x27; presence was not picked up by the LSTs.
# Better lifejacket training was provided for landing troops
# Plans were made for small craft to pick up floating survivors on D-Day.

Official histories contain little information about the tragedy. Some commentators have called it a cover-up, but the initial critical secrecy about Tiger may have merely resulted in longer-term quietude. In his book &quot;The Forgotten Dead: Why 946 American Servicemen Died Off The Coast Of Devon In 1944 – And The Man Who Discovered Their True Story&quot;, published in 1988, Ken Small declares that the event &quot;was never covered up; it was &#x27;conveniently forgotten&#x27;&quot;.

The casualty statistics from Tiger were not released by Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) until August 1944, along with the casualties of the actual D-Day landings. This report stated that there were 442 army dead and 197 navy, for a total of 639. (However, Moon had reported on 30 April that there were 749 dead.) Charles B. MacDonald, author and former deputy chief historian at the U.S. Army Center of Military History, notes that information from the SHAEF press release appeared in the August issue of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. MacDonald surmises that the press release went largely unnoticed in light of the larger events that were occurring at the time. The story was detailed in at least three books at the end of the war, including Captain Harry C. Butcher&#x27;s &quot;My Three Years With Eisenhower&quot; (1946), and in several publications and speeches.

===Memorials===

Devon resident and civilian Ken Small took on the task of seeking to commemorate the event, after discovering evidence of the aftermath washed up on the shore while beachcombing in the early 1970s.

In 1974, Small bought from the U.S. Government the rights to a submerged tank from the 70th Tank Battalion discovered in his search. In 1984, with the aid of local residents and diving firms, he raised the tank, which now stands as a memorial to the incident. The local authority provided a plinth on the seafront to put the tank on, and erected a plaque in memory of the men killed. The American military honoured and supported him. Small died of cancer in March 2004, a few weeks before the 60th anniversary of Exercise Tiger.

The Slapton Sands memorial plaque reads:
A plaque was erected, in 1995, at Arlington National Cemetery entitled &quot;Exercise Tiger Memorial&quot;. In 1997, the Exercise Tiger Association established a memorial to Exercise Tiger veterans in Mexico, Missouri. It is a 5,000-pound stern anchor from an LST of the Suffolk County Class on permanent loan from the Navy. In 2006, the Slapton Sands Memorial Tank Limited (a non-profit organisation, one of whose directors is Small&#x27;s son Dean) established a more prominent memorial listing the names of all the victims of the attacks on Exercise Tiger.

In 2012, a memorial plaque was erected at Utah Beach, Normandy, on the wall of a former German anti-aircraft bunker. An M4 Sherman tank stands as a memorial to Exercise Tiger at Fort Rodman Park in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

In 2019, the US servicemen who died in the exercise were remembered in an art installation by artist Martin Barraud. Bootprints of 749 troops were laid out on Slapton Sands to mark the 75th anniversary of Exercise Tiger. Commemorative bootprints and special plaques made by veterans to represent each of the 22,763 British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who were killed on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944 were sold. Barraud said:

Due to the secrecy around Operation Tiger they are unaware the location and time coincide with the Operation. Consequently, the E-boats attack and capture an officer with oversight of the D-Day landings. The plot revolves around ensuring his secrets aren&#x27;t revealed necessitating a delay in the Normandy plans.

<text>North Jersey, also known as Northern New Jersey, comprises the northern portions of the U.S. state of New Jersey between the upper Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean. As a distinct toponym, North Jersey is a colloquial one rather than an administrative one, reflecting geographical and perceived cultural and other differences between it and the southern part of the state.

North Jersey is characterized by its position, both geographically and culturally, within the greater New York City metropolitan area, as well as its high economic output, including its regional economic engines of Paramus in Bergen County, which had $6 billion in annual retail sales as of 2018 and Jersey City, whose financial district has been nicknamed &quot;Wall Street West&quot;, Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, and Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal.

Bergen County is the most populous county in both North Jersey and the state and serves as the western terminus for the George Washington Bridge, the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge, which connects Fort Lee, New Jersey to Upper Manhattan in New York City. Newark, located in Essex County, is New Jersey&#x27;s most populous city. Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth, located in Hudson, Passaic, and Union counties in North Jersey are the second, third, and fourth most populous cities in the state after Newark.

The exact definition of which counties constitute North Jersey is a subject of debate. Definitions of the North Jersey region of the state most consistently include Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, and Warren counties, though definitions of North Jersey frequently vary and may include other New Jersey counties in the New York metropolitan area that are sometimes differentiated as or considered &quot;Central Jersey&quot;, including Middlesex County, Union County, Monmouth County, Somerset County, Hunterdon County, Mercer County, and even the northern portion of Ocean County.

==Geography==


Geologically, North Jersey is largely in the Piedmont Province, the Highlands Province, and the Ridge and Valley Province. Depending on definitions, some are counted as being in the Atlantic coastal plain.

North Jersey has a Humid Continental Climate (Dfb) by Köppen.

===Definitions ===
One particular definition of North Jersey includes all points in New Jersey north of I-295 in the western part of the state and all points north of I-195 in the eastern part of the state. Another definition uses the old 1956-era 201 telephone area code, not the modern 201 area code, and all its additions, as this area code loosely included all of New Jersey north of Trenton. Some residents of the northern tier of counties use a narrower definition, counting only that area north of the mouth of the Raritan River. Conversely, people in South Jersey and within the Philadelphia metropolitan area, when using a two-portion approach that excludes Central Jersey as a separate category, may define North Jersey as consisting of Ocean County and every county north of it, essentially placing all New Jersey counties that are within the New York metropolitan area under the definition of North Jersey. The state is also sometimes described as having North Jersey and South Jersey separated from each other by Central Jersey.

=== Further subdivision ===
In 2008, the New Jersey State Department of Tourism divided the state into six tourist regions with the Gateway and Skylands regions included in North Jersey.

===Counties most consistently defined as North Jersey counties===

The following counties are most consistently considered North Jersey:

*Bergen County
*Essex County
*Hudson County
*Morris County
*Passaic County 
*Sussex County
*Warren County
*Union County is sometimes considered as a transitional county between North Jersey and Central Jersey

==History==
North Jersey was the site of some of the earliest European settlements in what would become the United States of America. Its colonial history started after Henry Hudson sailed through Newark Bay in 1609. Although Hudson was British, he worked for the Netherlands, so he claimed the land for the Dutch as part of the provincial colony of New Netherland, with original settlements centered in Bergen in today&#x27;s Hudson County. In 1664, the region became part of the Province of New Jersey.

During the American Revolutionary War, New Jersey was a strategic location between New York City, and the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Important materials necessary to the war effort were sometimes produced in North Jersey, and the Continental Army made its home in North Jersey for part of the war. George Washington, commanding general of the Continental Army, maintained his headquarters at Ford Mansion in Morristown for part of the Revolutionary War, from December 1779 to June 1780. In the northwestern part of the state, iron mines and foundries supplied raw material for the Continental Army&#x27;s guns and ammunition.

The American Industrial Revolution started by the founding of the North Jersey town of Paterson. Today, the United States and the world enjoy the fruit born of seeds planted in North Jersey during the Industrial Revolution. Alexander Hamilton, Secretary for the Treasury and President of the Bank of New York during the end of the eighteenth century, selected the Great Falls area, also known as the Passaic Falls, for an ambitious experiment. He promoted the natural power of the Great Falls as an excellent location for textile mills and other manufacturers.

Paterson attracted skilled craftsmen and engineers from Europe to run the mills and produced a large concentration of creative and able people. During the mid-nineteenth century, many of the engines and materials that would be used to colonize a continent were made here. Thomas Edison installed one of the first hydroelectric power plants in the world, which still provides electricity today, using the Great Falls as an energy source.

In West Orange, Edison created the first technical research and development facility with his invention factory. Electric light, improved motion pictures, and sound recording, were among the hundreds of inventions produced here.

==Demographics==
The seven counties that are most commonly included in North Jersey have an estimated total population of 3,787,937 as of 2022; this rises to 4,357,752 with the inclusion of Union County. As of the 2000 U.S. Census, the demographics of all the seven main counties combined are 66.8% White, 18.5% Hispanic or Latino, 15.4% African American, 6.6% Asian, 0.2% Native American, and 0.1% Pacific Islander.

== Population ==

==Professional sports fans==
Sports allegiances are often divided between the northern and southern portions of the state. The 2009 World Series divided the people of New Jersey, because South Jersey residents generally root for the Philadelphia Phillies, while North Jersey residents usually root for the New York Yankees or the New York Mets. A similar trend exists for most other major sports, with North Jersey residents supporting the Brooklyn Nets or the New York Knicks in basketball, the New Jersey Devils, or the New York Rangers in hockey, the New York Red Bulls or New York City FC in soccer, and the New York Giants or the New York Jets in football.

<text>Saag also spelled sag or saga, is a leafy vegetable dish from the Indian subcontinent. It is eaten with bread, such as roti or naan, or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella or finely chopped broccoli along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients, such as chhena.

In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour. &quot;Saag gosht&quot; or &quot;hariyali maans&quot; (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the North Indian state of Punjab.

Saags (Leafy greens) are an important part of the Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari cuisines of Uttarakhand. The abundance of leafy greens in the state is because of fertile land and forested land. Saags of &quot;Sarson&quot; (Mustard), &quot;Palak&quot; (spinach), &quot;Mooli&quot; (Radish) are common but exclusive saags cooked in the state are:

*&quot;Kandali saag&quot; / &quot;Bicchu ghas ka saag&quot; / &quot;Sisun ka saag&quot; - saag prepared from young leaves of the stinging nettle weed. First the leaves are boiled in water, rendering their stinging hairs harmless, before grinding them into a paste and cooking with ghee, tomato and spices to flavour them. Nettle leaves so prepared are highly nutritious, containing essential minerals and large amounts of protein 

*&quot;Lingdi ka saag&quot;: made using tender fern leaves.

=== Haryana ===
*&quot;Saag gosht&quot; or &quot;Hariyali Maans&quot; is a version of the dish prepared with meat often of mutton or &quot;lamb&quot;. This version of the dish is more common in the state of Haryana. The meat is usually cooked in a &quot;Bhatthi&quot; (clay oven) before being marinated in the other ingredients.

* In winters, saags of &quot;Channa/Cholia&quot; (chickpea leaves), &quot;Sarson&quot; (mustard), &quot;Methi&quot; (fenugreek), &quot;Palak&quot; (spinach), &quot;Bathua&quot; (chenopodium) are commonly cooked in Haryanvi households. These saags are mainly eaten with millet breads like Makki ki roti &amp; Bajra ki roti, smeared with ghee or butter.

===Punjab ===
* Saag is usually made with mustard leaves in Punjab, although spinach is common in other parts of the world. Saag is commonly served hot, usually with roti (wheat bread), chapati, &quot;makki ki roti&quot;, &quot;bajra ki roti&quot; and topped with clarified butter.

<text>Uta Barth (born 1958 :3) is a contemporary German-American photographer whose work addresses themes such as perception, optical illusion and non-place. Her early work emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s, &quot;inverting the notion of background and foreground&quot; in photography and bringing awareness to a viewer&#x27;s attention to visual information with in the photographic frame. Her work is as much about vision and perception as it is about the failure to see, the faith humans place in the mechanics of perception, and the precarious nature of perceptual habits. Barth&#x27;s says this about her art practice: “The question for me always is how can I make you aware of your own looking, instead of losing your attention to thoughts about what it is that you are looking at.&quot; She has been honored with two National Endowments of the Arts fellowships, was a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 2004‑05, and was a 2012 MacArthur Fellow. Barth lives and works in Los Angeles, California.

==Early years and education==
Barth was born in Berlin, Germany in 1958. Growing up in Europe gave Barth a different cultural perspective. Her memory of West Berlin is &quot;dark and austere&quot; and she left for the United States before the Berlin wall was taken down in 1989. During early adolescence her father began a research project in the U.S. at Stanford University and she moved to the U.S. shortly after. Barth was 12 years old and did not know English when she arrived in the United States. The shift from cold-war Germany to 1970s California was a culture shock for Barth.

Later, Barth&#x27;s received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Davis in 1982 and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1985. From 1990 to 2008, she was a professor in the Art Department at the University of California, Riverside, until she was given the honorary title of Professor Emeritus in the Department of Art in 2008 to the present. She was also a visiting Graduate Faculty member at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California, from 2000 to 2012 and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. After receiving the MacArthur Fellowship in October 2012, she noted that she still plans to teach on a part-time basis because teaching forces her to &quot;put language to&quot; what she is thinking.

== Work ==

=== Early work: late 1980s &amp; early 1990s ===
In 1989 Barth&#x27;s work was black and white, multi-paneled photographic and painted images mounted on wood that addressed the psychodynamics of vision, using optic patterns, repetitious visual metaphors for the eye, and diagrams related to light and human vision. The multi-panel work set up formal relationships that would continue through Barth&#x27;s artistic practice in later works. Barth explains that this early work was about “the confrontation with the camera, in the feeling of being looked at, blasted with light, being blinded, all as a physical experience.” In 1990, Barth continued to explore optic patterns and illusions in her works &quot;Untitled #11–14&quot;. This work includes four small photographs of houses that are encompassed in large fields of black and white strips, similar to that of static on a television screen and creates an optic vibration. The work intersects with the themes of photographic vision and the idea of the ‘gaze.’

=== Mid 1990s ===
Barth&#x27;s work began to internalize the space between the viewer and the object in the mid 1990s, zooming in and zooming out, looking close and far away in her works like &quot;Untitled #13&quot; (1991) and &quot;Untitled #16&quot; (1990). She begins playing with the communication of space with in the work through landscape and abstracted text, and plays with the idea of how the perception of the works occurs within the human body viewing it. Pamela Lee says, “the self-consciousness of looking is grounded in subjective looking” in Barth&#x27;s work. In &quot;Untitled #13&quot;, Barth includes a photograph of a landscape whose details are blurred to slow down the immediate understanding of the image by the audience. This effect describes the instability of one&#x27;s visual field of vision, and becomes the basis for Barth&#x27;s next series of works &quot;Grounds&quot;.

=== &quot;Grounds&quot; (1992–1995) ===
This body of photographs consists of over 50 images in different sizes and scales. These photos defy the conventional flat photographic image by being laminated prints that are then mounted on wood boards multiple inches thick, projecting the print away from the wall. As a result, the images of &quot;Grounds&quot; impersonate an object instead of a print. This plays into Barth&#x27;s conceptual ideas for the body of work, referring to these photographs as “containers of information.&quot; Writer Darren Campion says, &quot;Barth&#x27;s work addresses that fundamental dissonance between the world as it is and the world as we see it, the chasms of perceived experience. This is extended to other areas of the photographic process as well – the main correlate of space being, of course, time, and its fluidity, which seems antithetical to our notion of what photography does.&quot; Barth made the images by photographing generic locations outdoors as if she was shooting a formal portrait but removed the subject of the portrait in focus and left the out-of-focus background behind. Barth&#x27;s gesture reverses the typical use of the camera, shooting something out of focus instead of something in-focus. As a result, she photographs unoccupied space. Barth was thinking about stock photography while making this body of work, picturing backdrops for family photos and portrait photography from the 1960s and 1970s &gt;:3.

=== &quot;Fields&quot; (1995–1996) ===
In 1995 Barth began transitioning from her &quot;Grounds&quot; series into a new body of work known as &quot;Fields&quot;. She took her photographic approach in &quot;Grounds&quot; and turned it on its side, thinking about the site-specific relationship between the photograph and the physical space where it was made. This idea introduces motion into the work. Visual movement across the images in &quot;Fields&quot; creates a blur that is similar to that found in film and cinematic work. &quot;Fields&quot; produces the &quot;illusion of filmic space and time&quot; and Barth has said that she created this body of work in a similar way film producers scout locations for the perfect place to shoot a scene in a film.

In relation to her &quot;Field&quot; and &quot;Ground&quot; series, which depict blurred and empty foregrounds, Barth has stated: &quot;I am interested in the conventions of picture-making, in the desire to picture the world and in our relationship, our continual love for and fascination with pictures.&quot;

=== Late 1990s ===
In 1998 Barth begins another series of &quot;Untitled&quot; works, including &quot;Untitled (98.4)&quot; and &quot;Untitled (98.6)&quot;. Here, Barth begins to focus on sequencing in the gallery again, grouping images together in diptychs, triptychs and clusters. The work plays on the idea of multiple points of view or the experience of a visual double-take where a detail catches the viewer long enough to take a second image, a second look. To make this work, Barth would shoot multiple photographs in a row so that she could go back and edit the series of images to find the best photographs to pair together. This act re-introduces the notion of time into Barth&#x27;s work. She begins spacing her panels of images on the wall in intervals to show gaps in time between shooting the photographs.

=== Early 2000s ===
Barth creates two of her most famous bodies of work during the same time period, &quot;nowhere near&quot; (1999) and &quot;…and of time&quot; (2000). Here, Barth interrogates the temporality of photography and the duration of vision. In &quot;nowhere near&quot; the camera records a repeated view out of Barth&#x27;s living room window over multiple months. She made hundreds of images that contain moments of framing, records the ebb and flow of light and captures the change of the seasons. This body of work deals with the duration of looking and the prolonged engagement with &quot;seeing&quot; nothing. The series of work &quot;…and of time&quot; is the inverse series about the same window found in &quot;nowhere near&quot;. The images depict the light falling through the window, repeating grid like reflections of light that bounce and illuminate onto the wall and floor of Barth&#x27;s living room. &quot;The window becomes the aperture of the house and light and imagery project through it,&quot; Barth&#x27;s says.

In 2002 Barth creates &quot;white blind (bright red)&quot;. She deliberately sequences images, pairing anywhere from two, six or a dozen photographs of bare tree branches with white sky backdrops together. In contrast with the photographic panels are brightly colored panels of primary red, ox-blood, and a deep yellow scattered throughout the sequencing that break up the visual rhythm of movement from one image to the next. Instead of being drawn in by a single image, the viewer experiences a banned of images that flicker across the walls of the gallery in a horizon line of images. &quot;A flickering of visual consciousness,&quot; Holly Myers, an art critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote in reference to the work. Optical illusion occurs, as the viewer walks through the sequencing of tree branches and interrupting red and yellow color panels interspersed throughout the photographic imagery, creating afterimages that strike the viewers eyes.

=== &quot;...and to draw a bright white line with light&quot; (2011) ===
This series of work was commissioned by the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011 and marks a turn in Barth&#x27;s work. In this series, Barth&#x27;s intervention of her own body parts into the photographic frame to position the subject of the photograph is made visible. The viewer can identify Barth&#x27;s arm or arm&#x27;s shadow, as she creates the lines of light the camera captures in the series of photographs. This more recent work embodies Barth&#x27;s idea of her own personal intervention into the space that she photographs. In previous series she aimed to spark observation and a sense of visual perception in the work. &quot;Perhaps I have just discovered a way to make marks with light that fits into my ongoing practice,&quot; Barth&#x27;s explains about the series in an interview with Art in America. This interview was in conjunction with a show Barth&#x27;s had on view at gallery 1301PE in Los Angeles in September–October 2011. &quot;…and to draw a bright white line with light&quot; was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago May 14–August 16, 2011, as well as at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York in October–December 2011.

== Collaborations ==
The Getty Museum commissioned eleven Los Angeles Artists for a collaborative exhibition titled &quot;Departures: 11 Artists at the Getty&quot; and Uta Barth was invited to participate. The exhibition was open to the public from February 29, 2000 through May 7, 2000. Each artist was commissioned to create works in response to art in the Getty&#x27;s collection. Exhibition curator Lisa Lyons said, &quot;&quot;Departures&quot; is intended to explore the potent and sometimes surprising ways in which the art of the past can inform contemporary art. Equally important, the new works produced for the exhibition will offer valuable insights into the Getty collections.&quot; The press release for the show gave a brief description of the each artists goals for their work, including Barth who planned to create a series of multi-panel photographs capturing variations of a single view of the interior of her home. These images where inspired by two artists represented at the Getty: the Impressionist painter Claude Monet (&quot;Wheatstacks, Snow Effect Morning&quot;, 1891) and environmental artist Robert Irwin (&quot;Central Garden&quot;, 1997).

== Group shows ==
Uta Barth has also participated in multiple group shows nationally and international. One group show she participated in was held at the Getty Museum in 2013. The titled of the exhibition was &quot;At the Window: A Photographer’s View” and also included Gregory Crewdson and Yuki Onodera. Barth showed work from ‘nowhere near’ and ‘…and of time.’ This show articulates a theme and motif throughout Barth&#x27;s work: the window. In an interview with the artists in the show, Barth&#x27;s says, “The window is a wonderful vehicle for referring to the act of looking.” The exhibition displayed the contemporary artists work alongside art historical works like French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who took the world&#x27;s first photograph in 1826.

==Selected exhibitions and collections==
Her work has been featured in many exhibitions nationally and internationally, including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago; Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle; the SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah; SITE, Santa Fe; Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; Lannan Foundation, Santa Fe; and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul.
&quot;Uta Barth: Peripheral Vision&quot;, a large retrospective of her work, was shown at The Getty Center in 2022.

Barth&#x27;s work is represented in numerous public and private collections worldwide, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York and Bilbao, Spain; The Tate Modern, London; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Dallas Museum of Art, Texas; UCLA Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Getty Museum, Los Angeles; and The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, among others.

<text>The National Museum of American History: Kenneth E. Behring Center is a historical museum in Washington, D.C. It collects, preserves, and displays the heritage of the United States in the areas of social, political, cultural, scientific, and military history. Among the items on display is the original Star-Spangled Banner. The museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution and located on the National Mall at 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.

In 2023, the museum received 2.1 million visitors, ranking the eighth-most visited museum in the U.S.

==History==
The museum opened in 1964 as the Museum of History and Technology. It was one of the last structures designed by the renowned architectural firm McKim Mead &amp; White. In 1980, the museum was renamed the National Museum of American History to represent its mission of the collection, care, study, and interpretation of objects that reflect the experience of the American people.

The museum site had previously held two temporary war buildings constructed in 1942.

In May 2012, John Gray became the new director. He retired from the post in May 2018 and was succeeded by Anthea M. Hartig who was previously chief executive of the California Historical Society.

===Renovations===
The museum underwent an $85 million renovation from September 5, 2006, to November 21, 2008, during which time it was closed. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill provided the architecture and interior design services for the renovation, led by Gary Haney. Major changes made during the renovation include:

* A new, five-story sky-lit atrium, which is surrounded by displays of artifacts that showcase the breadth of the museum&#x27;s collection.
* A new, grand staircase that links the museum&#x27;s first and second floors.
* A new welcome center, and the addition of six landmark objects to orient visitors.
* New galleries, such as the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Hall of Invention.
* An environmentally controlled chamber to protect the original Star-Spangled Banner flag.

In 2012, the museum began a $37 million renovation of the west wing to add new exhibition spaces, public plazas and an education center. The renovation will also include panoramic windows overlooking the National Mall on all three floors and new interactive features to the exhibits. The first floor of the west wing reopened on July 1, 2015, with the second and third floors of the west wing reopening in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

==Layout==

Each wing of the museum&#x27;s three exhibition floors is anchored by a landmark object to highlight the theme of that wing. These include the &quot;John Bull&quot; locomotive, the Greensboro, North Carolina lunch counter, and a one of a kind draft wheel. Landmarks from pre-existing exhibits include the 1865 Vassar Telescope, a George Washington Statue, a Red Cross ambulance, and a car from Disneyland&#x27;s Dumbo Flying Elephant ride.

Artifact walls, of glass-fronted cases, line the first and second floor center core. The artifact walls are organized around themes including arts; popular culture; business, work and economy; home and family; community; land and natural resources; peopling America; politics and reform; science; medicine; technology; and the United States&#x27; role in the world.

===Building===

====Lower level====
The lower level of the museum displays &quot;Taking America to Lunch&quot;, which celebrates the history of American lunch boxes, many decorated with pop culture. The museum&#x27;s food court, the Stars and Stripes Café, and ride simulators are also located here.

====First floor====

The first floor&#x27;s East Wing (called 1 East) has exhibits that feature transportation and technology; they include &quot;America on the Move&quot; and &quot;Lighting a Revolution.&quot; The &quot;John Bull&quot; locomotive is the signature artifact. Exhibits within &quot;America on the Move&quot; include Southern Railway locomotive no. 1401, Santa Cruz Railroad no. 3, and a Chicago &quot;L&quot; elevated station diorama featuring a CTA 6000-series railcar.

The exhibits in the West Wing (1 West) address science and innovation. They include &quot;Science in American Life featuring Robots on the Road&quot; and &quot;Bon Appétit! Julia Child&#x27;s Kitchen.&quot; &quot;Spark!Lab&quot; is a hands-on exhibit of the Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. The Vassar Telescope is the signature artifact.

A café and the main museum store are also located on the first floor. The first floor also contains the Constitution Avenue lobby (1 Center), as well as a space for a temporary exhibit.

====Second floor====

The exhibitions in 2 East, the east wing of the second floor, consider American ideals and include the Albert Small Documents Gallery featuring rotating exhibits. From November 21, 2008, through January 4, 2009, an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, on loan from the White House, was on display. The Greensboro lunch counter is the signature artifact for this section of the museum.

Located in the center of the second floor (2 Center) is the original Star Spangled Banner Flag which inspired Francis Scott Key&#x27;s poem. The newly conserved flag, the centerpiece of the renovated museum, is displayed in a climate-controlled room at the heart of the museum. An interactive display by Potion Design, just across the room from the flag, features a full-size, digital reproduction of the flag that allows patrons to learn more about it by touching different areas on the flag.

The &quot;George Washington&quot; statue, sculpted by Horatio Greenough for exhibit in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol and in celebration of the centennial of Washington&#x27;s birth, is the signature artifact for 2 West, the west wing of the second floor of the museum.

An entire eighteenth century colonial house, the Choate-Caldwell House () from Ipswich, Massachusetts is located on the second floor (in 2 West) as part of the &quot;Within These Walls&quot; exhibit.

The second floor also houses the museum&#x27;s new welcome center and a store. The second-floor lobby leads out to Madison Drive and the National Mall.

====Third floor====

Exhibits in the east wing of the third floor, 3 East, are focused on the military history of the United States; they include &quot;The Price of Freedom: Americans at War&quot; and the gunboat &quot;Philadelphia&quot;.

The center of the third floor, 3 Center, presents &quot;The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden&quot;, which explores the personal and public lives of the men who have held that office. It also features the popular permanent exhibit of &quot;First Ladies of America&quot;, which features their contributions and changing roles, and displays their dresses as a mark of changing times.

The third-floor west wing, 3 West, has exhibits that feature entertainment, sports, and music. These include &quot;Thanks for the Memories: Music, Sports and Entertainment History&quot;, the Hall of Musical Instruments, and &quot;The Dolls&#x27; House&quot;. A car from Disneyland&#x27;s Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride. The most recent exhibit is &quot;Entertainment Nation&quot; which features objects from Judy Garland, Prince, Selena, Muhammad Ali, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, and more.

===Outdoor sculptures===
In 1967, the abstract sculpture &quot;Infinity&quot; was dedicated at the National Mall entrance. Designed by José de Rivera and created by Roy Gussow, it was one of the first abstract sculptures displayed at a major public building in Washington D.C. The sculpture is a , polished stainless steel ribbon on top of a granite tower.

Alexander Calder&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Gwenfritz&quot; was installed in a fountain on the west side. The steel abstract stabile was dedicated to the museum on June 2, 1969. In 1984, the museum moved the work to a site closer to Constitution Avenue until July 2013, when conservators removed it for restoration. The sculpture returned to its original site in November 2014, and sits in the midst of a re-created reflecting pool. Calder&#x27;s original plan for the sculpture envisioned it surrounded by water jets, but architects and engineers of the site determined that the fountain would be challenging to maintain and the water spray would hasten deterioration of the metal.

===Archives===
In support of the museum&#x27;s mission, the Archives Center identifies, acquires, and preserves significant archival records in many media and formats to document America&#x27;s history and its diverse cultures. Center staff arrange, describe, preserve, and make collections accessible in support of scholarship, exhibitions, publications, and education.

The Archives Center occupies over of shelving in the National Museum of American History building. Subject strengths include the history of the radio, television, the telegraph, computing, and other aspects of the history of technology with a special interest in the history of invention; advertising, marketing, and entrepreneurship; commercial visual ephemera (postcards, greeting cards); American music (sheet music, jazz) and musical instruments. These, and a wide range of other subjects, are documented in business records, personal papers, and extensive holdings of motion picture film, video and sound recordings, historical photographs, and oral histories.

===Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation===
The Lemelson Center, an initiative of the Lemelson Foundation, produces educational programs, popular and academic publications, exhibitions, podcasts and symposia about invention. The mission of the Lemelson Center is to document, interpret and disseminate information about invention and innovation, encourage creativity in young people, and foster an appreciation for the central role of innovation in the history of the United States. The Center frequently provides a multi-year focus on some aspect of how invention has influenced American society, such as its 2002 &quot;Invention and the Environment&quot; theme. Programs include an annual symposium, presentations and guest speakers, and often the publication of a book highlighting a particular topic.

The Center provides free curricular material to classrooms throughout the United States, organizes traveling museum exhibitions (such as &quot;Invention at Play&quot;), and provides research opportunities. It obtains archival collections related to invention for the museum&#x27;s Archives Center. Such collections consist of the papers and materials that document the work of past and current American inventors.

<text>The Raccoons is a Canadian animated television series that ran on CBC from November 11, 1985, to March 19, 1991, in Canada and on Disney Channel from July 4, 1985, to August 28, 1992, in the U.S., with three preceding television specials from its inception in 1980, and one direct-to-video special in 1984. The franchise was created by Kevin Gillis with the co-operation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

==Synopsis==
The series revolves around Bert Raccoon and married couple Ralph and Melissa Raccoon, of whom Bert is a friend and roommate. The series mostly involved the trio&#x27;s efforts against the industrialist forces of greedy aardvark millionaire Cyril Sneer, who regularly tries to destroy the forest for personal wealth. However, the Raccoons always save their forest from Cyril&#x27;s schemes, with help from their forest friends including Schaeffer, a gentle Old English Sheepdog; Cedric, Cyril&#x27;s college graduate son; and Sophia Tutu, Cedric&#x27;s girlfriend. As the series progresses, Cyril becomes more of a sympathetic character, eventually becoming an antihero, becoming more responsible in his priorities and business practices.

Originally, the story was set in a kind of hidden world in the Evergreen Forest where a small human family of a forest ranger and his children reside unaware of the struggles taking place out of sight. The second season had these human characters removed as the premise shifted to an unambiguous fantasy world of a sophisticated humanoid animal version of Canada with complex transportation systems, broadcasting media and heavy industry etc. In addition, Ralph&#x27;s relatives become regular characters, especially his young nephew and niece, Bentley the insecure child technology prodigy and Lisa the statuesque athletic teenager who became an understated love interest for Bert.

Unlike many other cartoons of its time, it handled action, humour, and romance in a fairly sophisticated manner, while remaining sufficiently uncomplicated for younger viewers. Lessons featured in the series mainly focused on environmentalism. It also covered other topics, including friendship and teamwork.

==Episodes==
==Characters==
===Main===
* Bert Raccoon (voiced by Len Carlson) – The main protagonist of the series. He is Ralph and Melissa&#x27;s houseguest and is their best friend from childhood. An energetic raccoon with a lot of imagination, Bert always likes to seek out adventure and to live life to the fullest. Although he is impulsive and prone to foolish decisions, he has a kind heart.
* Ralph Raccoon (voiced by Bob Dermer) and Melissa Raccoon (voiced by Rita Coolidge (specials 1–2), Dottie West (special 3), Linda Feige (season 1) and Susan Roman (seasons 2–5)) – The happily married couple who live in the &quot;Raccoondominium&quot; with their more-or-less permanent houseguest Bert. Ralph tolerates Bert&#x27;s antics to some extent and knows his heart is in the right place but it does not prevent him from getting frustrated by them. He is also the founder of &quot;The Evergreen Standard&quot; newspaper. Melissa is the more sensible of the three raccoons, and is always there to give the boys a push in the right direction. She often enjoys a good laugh too, usually when Bert or Ralph act silly or when Cyril&#x27;s plans go embarrassingly awry.
* Cedric Sidney Sneer (voiced by Fred Little (specials 1–3) and Marvin Goldhar (series)) – Cyril Sneer&#x27;s nerdy son and Bert Raccoon&#x27;s best friend, and heir to the Sneer fortune. Since the special &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot; Cedric has gained a crush on Sophia and usually acts nervous around her. In the specials, he was completely passive and subservient to his father, but gradually becomes more assertive as the series goes on.
* Schaeffer (voiced by Carl Banas) – A large sheepdog, who is friends with the Raccoons. Originally portrayed as slow and dimwitted in the original specials, he quickly became one of the smartest characters on the series, and eventually opened the Blue Spruce Cafe as a bartender and assists with the Evergreen Standard&#x27;s technical needs.
* Broo (voiced by Sharon Lewis) – A sheepdog puppy who seems to favor Bert as his owner in season 2 after the human characters were dropped from the show.
* Sophia Tutu (voiced by Sharon Lewis) – Cedric&#x27;s ditzy girlfriend, who is a superb swan glider and diver. Although clearly an aardvark, she is much more humanoid in appearance than either Cedric or Cyril. She is very feminine, but likes to ride bikes with Cedric and once participated in the Evergreen Games, coming in third place. She was phased out of the show in later seasons.
* Cyril Sneer (voiced by Michael Magee) – Originally the main villain of the series, Cyril is an aardvark, with a long, pink nose, a ruthless and greedy businessman and Cedric&#x27;s father. Although Cyril starts off villainous, he later softens up, becoming distinctly less so as the series progresses, though he retains his treacherous, greedy nature. Despite his money-grubbing ways, he has shown to genuinely love his son and tries grooming him to take over the family business. He has a soft spot for Bentley and Lisa, Ralph&#x27;s nephew and niece. He has a strict matter of pride about keeping promises, as shown in the episodes &quot;Going it Alone!&quot; and &quot;Trouble Shooter!&quot;
* Snag (voiced by Michael Magee) – Cyril and Cedric Sneer&#x27;s (non-anthropomorphic) pet dog. He has blue fur, a nose similar to his aardvark-owners&#x27; and a bad temper that rivals Cyril&#x27;s, but he also loves Cedric and once saved him from a fire.
* The Pigs (voiced by Nick Nichols (Pig One (special 3 – episodes 50; 58)), Keith Hampshire (Pig One (episodes 51–60)), Len Carlson (Pigs Two and Three (series)) and Fred Little (Pig Three (special 3) – Cyril&#x27;s three bumbling henchmen and assistants. They are almost never referred to by name, as they are simply listed as Pig One, Two and Three in the credits, although they occasionally refer to one another as &quot;Lloyd&quot;. Fans of the show have referred Pig One as &quot;Lloyd&quot; and the other two as &quot;Boyd&quot; and &quot;Floyd&quot;. Kevin Gillis said their names were &quot;Lloyd, Lloyd and their somewhat gullible brother, Floyd&quot;. (However some fans point out this makes no sense from a logical point of view for two characters to have the same name).
* The Bears (voiced by Len Carlson, Bob Dermer and Carl Banas) – Cyril Sneer&#x27;s additional henchmen, workers, butlers, soldiers, spies, etc.
* Bentley Raccoon (voiced by Noam Zylberman (episodes 16–54) and Stuart Stone (as Stu Stone) (episodes 55–60) – George and Nicole&#x27;s son. He&#x27;s an expert with computers, and is a very typical younger kid, with a tendency to overemphasize his personal setbacks. He often favours houseguest Bert while Cyril Sneer thinks highly of him. He is originally introduced as Ralph&#x27;s cousin in his first appearance but later retconned into his nephew.
* Lisa Raccoon (voiced by Lisa Lougheed) – Ralph&#x27;s niece and Bentley&#x27;s teenage basketball-playing sister, who becomes a prominent character in Season 5, after her first appearance in the Season 4 episode &quot;Spring Fever&quot;, where she comes to visit.

===Supporting===
* Dan the Forest Ranger (voiced by Rupert Holmes (special 1), Leo Sayer (special 2), John Schneider (special 3), Kevin Gillis (special 4 (uncredited)) and Murray Crunchley (series) – The caretaker of the Evergreen Forest, as well as the father of Tommy and Julie and owner of Schaeffer and Broo during the specials and Season 1. He is shown to be a single father as there is no mention of the mother of his children in neither the specials nor the series.
* Tommy (voiced by Hadley Kay (specials) and Noam Zylberman (series)) – Ranger Dan&#x27;s son and one of Schaeffer and Broo&#x27;s original owners as well as Julie&#x27;s younger brother.

==Production==
The &quot;Raccoons&quot; franchise was originally conceived by Canadian TV personality Kevin Gillis in the 1970s, while appearing in shows like &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; and &quot;Yes You Can&quot;. The initial idea for the show was created by Gillis and columnist Gary Dunford. They drew their inspiration for Ralph Raccoon from a dilemma that happened at a cottage in Ottawa. Dunford backed out, but Gillis took his idea to Ottawa lawyer Sheldon S. Wiseman, who saw a potential in Gillis&#x27; idea and put together a large group of animators, musicians and writers to create the first special to star the characters known as &quot;The Christmas Raccoons&quot;. Production on the special began in 1979 and was completed the following year, and the special was broadcast on December 17, 1980 on CBC Television. It was also broadcast in several countries around the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The special was a huge hit and its success resulted in two sequel specials &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot; and &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot; and a direct-to-video special, &quot;The Raccoons: Let&#x27;s Dance!&quot;. 

In 1981, US television networks CBS, NBC and ABC approached Sheldon Wiseman about producing a 13-episode &quot;Raccoons&quot; television series. In 1984, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Disney Channel began funding on the television series, which cost about $4.5 million to make. In the U.S., the show was run on The Disney Channel from July 4, 1985 until August 28, 1992. In Canada, it was shown on CBC on Monday evenings for the first season and was shown in a block consisting of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; and Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on Sundays for the next two seasons before moving to Wednesdays in its fourth, sharing an hour block with &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; and then eventually Tuesdays in its fifth and final season.

===Music===
The series had a new wave soundtrack including the theme song &quot;Run with Us&quot; by cast member Lisa Lougheed. Season 1 ended with a different version of the song, not sung by Lougheed. &quot;Run with Us&quot; was performed in season 1 by Stephen Lunt. In the first season, Canadian singer Luba performed several songs, several of which were later re-recorded by Lougheed for use in other seasons. There were also several other songs performed by other musicians such as Rita Coolidge and Rupert Holmes who performed songs for the first special, Leo Sayer and Coolidge again for the second, and John Schneider and Dottie West for the final TV special. 

Due to contractual reasons, Schneider&#x27;s vocals on three of the songs were replaced with Frank Floyd and Hank Martin when they were released on the accompanying soundtrack album for the fourth special. Rory Dodd, The Dior Bros. (actually Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll under a pseudonym), and many other musicians also had songs performed, although somewhat rarely compared to the aforementioned people. According to Jon Stroll, Frank Floyd, the frontman of the 1970s R&amp;B funk group The Writers, was originally selected to be the main male singer for the series but backed out at the last minute. Needing a replacement, they brought in Curtis King Jr. at the suggestion of backup singer Valerie Wilson.

The earlier version of &quot;Run with Us&quot;, like quite a few of the other songs from &quot;The Raccoons&quot;, were never officially released. The songs from the first two specials were released on the album &quot;Lake Freeze – The Raccoons Songtrack&quot; in 1983. A soundtrack for the fourth special was released in 1984, but featured vocals from Frank Floyd and Hank Martin to replace John Schneider. Nine of the songs from the series featured on Lougheed&#x27;s album &quot;Evergreen Nights&quot; (1987), though Lougheed only sang some of the songs (sometimes in duets), while some were sung by other artists (Curtis King Jr. and Stephen Lunt). The French version of &quot;Run with Us&quot;, as well as most of Luba and Lisa Lougheed&#x27;s songs, was performed by the Quebecois Canadian singer Jano Bergeron with &quot;Run with Us&quot; being renamed in French to &quot;Viens Vers Nous&quot;.

The instrumental music was composed by Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll and performed largely by the National Arts Centre Orchestra from Ottawa, Canada, though due to contractual reasons, they were credited as the National Raccoon Orchestra and later the Royal Raccoon Orchestra on the accompanying soundtrack albums. Most of the instrumental cues heard in the series were actually recorded for &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot; and re-used. Only six of the instrumental tunes (two from &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot; and four from &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot;) have ever been released officially (they can be found on the &quot;Lake Freeze&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance!&quot; albums).

===Animation===
From 1979 until 1985, Canadian animation studio Atkinson Film-Arts provided the animation for the four specials and first season of the series. In 1986, after producing the first 11 episodes, Hinton Animation Studios took over to animate the remaining seasons of the show (seasons 2–5).

==Telecast and home media==
&quot;The Raccoons&quot; ran on CBC from November 11, 1985 until March 19, 1991 in Canada. It was also broadcast in several countries around the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as several countries in Continental Europe. In Canada, it was shown on CBC on Monday evenings for the first season and was shown in a block consisting of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; and &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; on Sundays for the next two seasons unitl moving to Wednesdays in its fourth, sharing an hour block with &quot;The Beachcombers&quot; and then eventually Tuesdays in its fifth and final season. In the U.S., the show ran on The Disney Channel from July 4, 1985 until August 28, 1992. In the late 1990s, Trio, a US cable network then partially owned by the CBC, aired repeats of the show.

In the United Kingdom, the BBC broadcast the series from 1985 to 1991 as part of its children&#x27;s programming block Children&#x27;s BBC (now called CBBC). During this time, it was shown on the Saturday morning children&#x27;s show Going Live!. In the late 2000s, repeats of the show aired on Boomerang UK.

Embassy Home Entertainment released the specials and Season 1 on home video from 1982 to 1987. Embassy also released the specials on Laserdisc, CED and Betamax formats. Other distributors, such as Catalyst and GoodTimes Home Entertainment also released the Raccoons specials and episodes on VHS.

In the United Kingdom, Embassy Home Entertainment released the four Raccoons specials on VHS in the mid-1980s, before the distribution rights went to Channel 5 Video (a division of Polygram Video) in 1986. They re-released the four specials on video, and released another video called &quot;The Raccoons Big Surprise&quot; with two Season 1 episodes &quot;Surprise Attack&quot; and &quot;Going It Alone&quot; (Cat. No. CFV 05042). Then, three videos with Season 2 episodes were released, the first two were released by Picture Music International (PMI) that included &quot;Double Play&quot; and &quot;The Sweet Smell of Success&quot; on volume 1, released in 1988 and then &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; and &quot;Power Trip&quot; on volume 2, released in 1989. Then Video Collection International Ltd. released a third tape which contained the episodes &quot;Stop The Clock&quot; and &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; on 13 August 1990 (Cat No. VC1191). That same tape was re-released again by Video Collection International Ltd. on 22 July 1991, as part of their &quot;Children&#x27;s Club&quot; range (Cat No. KK0019).

In 2003, Morningstar Entertainment released the show on DVD for the first time. Two 9-episode boxsets were released, each containing 3 discs that were also available separately. The discs were released without any region coding in NTSC format. The first set contained nine of the ten episodes from season 2 (omitting &quot;Stop the Clock&quot;) and the second set contained the first nine episodes of season 3. The extras include character bios, a chance to create your own scene from &quot;The Raccoons&quot; and Raccoon-A-Roma DVD-ROM content, like QuickTime animated sequences. For this release, Len Carlson also reprised his role as Bert during menus and gave in-character commentary before and after episodes. Both sets are now out of print, and no North American DVD release has come out since then.

A 2-disc Region 2 PAL DVD release of the complete series 1 was released in the UK on September 17, 2007 through Fabulous Films Ltd. The bonus features on set 1 were duplicated from the Canadian release, mainly the create a scene and Raccoon-A-Roma DVD ROM content. They later released a DVD entitled &quot;Three Adventures With The Raccoons&quot; on April 7, 2008. This DVD contained the first 3 episodes of Series 1 (&quot;Surprise Attack&quot;, &quot;Going It Alone&quot; and &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;) with no extras. Series 2 was released on April 20, 2009 by Fabulous Films Ltd. in another 2-disc set. DVD extras on the set include character model sheets and a documentary.

In September 2009, MORE Entertainment released an 8-disc DVD set in Germany, containing all 60 episodes (7–8 per disc) and no extras. The language track is German only. Later in November 2013, MORE released a DVD featuring all four Raccoons specials. As with the previous complete series set, the only language track is German.

In December 2009, the first season of &quot;The Raccoons&quot; was released on iTunes in Canada. It was also released on iTunes in the U.S. in April 2010. The first two seasons were released on DVD to Netflix in the U.S. in early-2010 and in Canada in August 2011.

Since March 27, 2023, the series in its 4K remastered form currently airs in repeats on Boomerang Canada.

==Reception==
&quot;The Raccoons&quot; was well received by critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its review for their second TV special, said &quot;the Raccoons are an adorable lot, supported nicely by an attractive production.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the third special, &quot;The Raccoons and the Lost Star&quot;, calling it &quot;a rollicking good adventure filled with space-age animation, high-tech gadgetry, lilting tunes, a lovable sheepdog, and the delightful Raccoons team.&quot;

In 2022, series creator Kevin Gillis said that the show was seeing a resurgence of interest, speculating that it was due to the &quot;original audience now having young families of their own and want[ing] to reach back to what helped form their early lives.&quot;

The show was nominated for many awards, including a Gemini Award for &quot;Best Sound&quot; and &quot;Best Writing&quot;, and won the Gemini for &quot;Best Animated Series&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1990, Bert and Lisa were named the mascots of the Canadian Olympic team. That year, the Canadian Junior Olympics were held.

Its theme song &quot;Run with Us&quot; was also featured in the 2011 film &quot;Hobo with a Shotgun.&quot;

In January 2022, the show was featured in the premiere episode of &quot;Son of a Critch&quot;.

Children&#x27;s novels based on the series were published by Cardiff-based publisher Candy Jar Books in 2024.

<text>Rainbow Brite is a media franchise by Hallmark Cards, introduced in 1984. The animated &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot; television series first aired in 1984, the same year Hallmark licensed Rainbow Brite to Mattel for a range of dolls and other merchandise. A theatrical feature-length film, &quot;Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer&quot;, was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The franchise was rebooted in 2014 with a three part mini-series released on Hallmark&#x27;s online streaming video service, Feeln. A line of new merchandise by Hallmark online and in its shops debuted in 2015.

==Production==
Rainbow Brite made her animated debut in the syndicated prime-time television special, &quot;Peril in the Pits,&quot; which was first aired on June 27, 1984. Later, a pair of two-part specials were produced: &quot;The Mighty Monstromurk Menace&quot; and &quot;The Beginning of Rainbowland.&quot;

A theatrical feature-length film, &quot;Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer&quot;, was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The specials became part of DIC&#x27;s weekly syndicated &quot;Kideo TV&quot; block of programming starting in April 1986, which were followed up with eight more episodes for a total of thirteen, which is one season in American television, and were rerun until the end of March 1987, after which the show was replaced on the &quot;Kideo TV&quot; schedule by &quot;Lady Lovely Locks &amp; the Pixietails&quot;. All were published on VHS videotapes in the United States and other countries, along with two live-action programs. One of these was a program intended for use at kids&#x27; birthday parties (&quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday Party&quot;); the other was made on location at the San Diego Zoo (&quot;San Diego Zoo Adventure&quot;).

==Premise==
In Gen 1 continuity, and most of the franchise&#x27;s backstory, a young girl named Wisp is brought to a gray, desolate land with the mission to bring color to this fictional world by locating the Sphere of Light. Along the way, she befriends a furry creature (called a sprite) named Twink and a horse named Starlite and finds a mysterious baby who turns out to be the key to her mission. With the help of her new friends, Wisp locates the legendary Color Belt and rescues the seven Color Kids, who had been trapped by the King of Shadows. Using the Color Belt, Wisp and the Sphere of Light defeat the King of Shadows, liberate the sprites, and bring color and beauty to the land, henceforth called Rainbow Land. Wisp is renamed Rainbow Brite in honor of her new role as leader of the Color Kids, who are together in charge of all the colors in the universe.

The Color Kids spread color across the universe from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid is in charge of their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components to brightening and coloring any object or place. The Star Sprinkles also power Rainbow Brite&#x27;s Color Belt, which manifests a powerful multicolored energy force she uses to fight evil and help Starlight travel on. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids&#x27; mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other villains. Brian, a boy from Earth, sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures.

In the movie, &quot;Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer&quot;, the setting expands to include the diamond planet, Spectra. All the light in the universe must pass through Spectra before coming to Earth. However, Earth soon falls into a wintry darkness when the diamond-obsessed Dark Princess decides to steal Spectra for her own. Rainbow Brite and her horse, Starlite, must team with Spectra&#x27;s boy warrior, Krys, and his robotic horse, On-X, to defeat the powers of darkness and save Spectra, Earth, and the universe.

Gen 2 continuity took a radical departure from any other generation&#x27;s story, focusing as much on ethnic diversity as the colors of the rainbow. Rainbow Brite had an entirely new and smaller group of friends called the Color Crew. Despite distribution and marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, the toy line never reached the success of its predecessor and ended after little more than a year.

Gen 3 was basically a relaunch of Gen 1 in 2003, with the same story, but a smaller range of characters produced. The dolls from Toy Play were similar to but not exact copies of the Gen 1 versions. There was also a sizable amount of Rainbow Brite merchandise from various other manufacturers just as in Gen 1.

Gen 4A celebrated the 25th anniversary of Rainbow Brite in 2009 with continuity returning the setting again to Rainbow Land, which looked nothing like the original version. This time, Rainbow Brite and her friends&#x27; mission was to bring hope and happiness to the far corners of the universe, making hearts lighter and worlds a little more colorful along the way. The story focuses on Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow, each representing one of Rainbow Land&#x27;s Sky Powers, which determine the cycles of the days and seasons. Gen 4 continuity makes Rainbow Brite a girl originally from Earth (Return to Rainbow Land). Rainbow Brite&#x27;s absence from the world is explained in a story that sees Rainbow return to her home on Earth for a brief visit with her family after many adventures spreading color throughout Rainbow Land and the universe. But when the Dark Princess erases Rainbow Land from Rainbow Brite&#x27;s memory while on Earth, she never returns to her duties in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite eventually returns to Rainbow Land with the help of Starlite and Puppy Brite. These dolls had a more mature fashion doll-like design, which was totally unlike all of the previous dolls in the series. The three girl dolls were wearing training bras and panties under their clothes. The line suffered a delay, which caused the toys to not be available until after the holiday season that year. It saw scarce distribution as retailers were not impressed with it and was canceled after just seven months and before the first release was completed.

Feeln&#x27;s (part of Hallmark) Gen 4B animated reboot retained most Gen 1 story elements and recognizable but not identical character designs. It introduced a few new story elements, one being the Sentinels of Light, which included Rainbow Brite as a guardian of light and color and Krys as the protector of light unseen. Stormy also played a more prominent role. After a falling out with her pal, Rainbow Brite, Stormy joined the forces of darkness and became a formidable frenemy. As the Dark Princess&#x27;s manipulations became more transparent, Stormy started questioning where her true loyalties lay and returned to Rainbow Land as Rainbow Brite&#x27;s friend. Gen 4B consisted solely of web content from Hallmark and only resulted in a minuscule amount of give-away merchandise. None of the items were available for purchase.

Gen 5 began in 2015 with dolls and toys very similar to those of Gens 1 and 3. Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, distribution and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark&#x27;s Itty Bittys plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink &amp; Starlite plushes, a 16&quot; Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women&#x27;s clothing, and an expansion of the Itty Bittys line. In the fall of 2016, Hallmark released a Stormy doll with her own horse.

==Merchandise==

===First Generation: Mattel===
For the first Rainbow Brite generation (1984–1987), Mattel produced the dolls and many of the toys along with a large line of school supplies only sold in Italy. Other Rainbow Brite licensed merchandise was produced by various companies. This included many story and activity books published by Western Publishing (Little Golden Books), a number of puzzles, a line of costume jewellery, banks and suitcases by Kat&#x27;s Meow, clothes, toys, games, doll and child furniture, radios, child cosmetics, linen, towels, personal care items, lamps, figurines, VHS videocassettes, audio cassettes, vinyl records, bicycles, bedding, curtains and other merchandise sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The rest of Europe saw a smaller variety of merchandise, though this varied from country to country.

Books, comic books, sticker albums and audio tapes were the best selling licensed items outside the United Kingdom, but other items did exist in different countries. In Germany alone, there were no less than 31 story cassettes and 46 comic books. Germany also had an exclusive version of the Dress Up Rainbow Brite doll that included a story cassette. This cassette was not sold separately but was produced by Europa, producer of the other 30 story cassettes. It is unknown if the cassettes were sent to the Asian factory that made the dolls or were put into the dolls&#x27; boxes in Germany. 

A line of five 3D erasers in the form of various Rainbow Brite characters was sold in Europe with Mattel branding, while the same line was also sold in Australia under the name of Harveston Super Action figures with the addition of an additional character (Lurky) not sold in Europe. A number of Gen 1B (the second release of the first generation) dolls made for the American and Mexican markets ended up being sold in Germany due to strong demand there. These dolls had their English or Spanish names covered by a sticker with the German name or sometimes nothing at all. 

Two Rainbow Brite dolls (plus Twink and Starlite) were also produced in Brazil by Estrela. These were not exported anywhere else in the world and came in their own unique white packaging with all writing except the Rainbow Brite logo in Brazilian Portuguese. Due to the worldwide popularity of Rainbow Brite soon after she was launched, a number of other companies unrelated to Mattel produced many unlicensed lookalike (fake or bootleg) items that were sold in North America and Europe.

The Mattel line of toys and dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those that came with the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wall-hangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 different items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. 

These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the &#x27;Emotions&#x27; line. This line included five dolls including a 15&quot; Buddy Blue doll that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, the Emotions dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but the Emotions version of Starlite was smaller than the regular version. As such, the Emotions dolls were neither in scale with the Emotions horse or the regular Mattel version. And of course, the Emotions dolls were too big to sit on the Emotions horse or the normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and the Emotions line was never sold outside the United States and Canada.

Of the entire Mattel line, Mattel&#x27;s Dress Up line of dolls and horses are highly sought after by collectors, particularly Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy&#x27;s doll was shown in the 1986 Mattel catalog and on the backs of the Dress Up doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in the movie, some episodes of the cartoon and several German comics. There was also a line of catalogued clothing for the Dress Up dolls, but like Stormy, the clothing line only made to the prototype stage and was never produced. The two horses, Starlite and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were, in fact, repainted and repackaged horses from Mattel&#x27;s line of Barbie merchandise. The Dress Up line only lasted for about a year, making the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite Dress Up dolls were mass-produced worldwide, but are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line.

Televised commercials for Mattel&#x27;s Rainbow Brite dolls frequently featured the song, &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; from The Wizard of Oz, often with altered lyrics or arrangements. Child actors Tracey Gold, Kellie Martin and Heather O&#x27;Rourke, famous for their roles in 1980s television and film, also appeared.

===Second Generation: Up, Up and Away===
The second Rainbow Brite generation (1996–1997) greatly differed from any generation before or since. It used the Rainbow Brite name but not the same characters or backstory. The master license was held by Up, Up and Away, a company which is no longer in business.

Rainbow Brite no longer had anything do with making colors and was now in charge of diversity. Although this version did have rainbow-colored hair, the characters resembled real-world children more than their previous animated and doll counterparts. In the second generation&#x27;s story, Rainbow Brite had four friends, called the Color Crew, which included Amber (Latina), Cerise (Asian), Ebony (African-American) and Indigo (Middle Eastern, the only character name borrowed from the original Color Kids).

Rainbow Brite was produced as large and small dolls while the Color Crew was represented only in the small doll range. The large Rainbow Brite dolls came with three pots of Color-Glo Paint and a brush, while the small dolls included a single pot of Color-Glo Paint and a brush. The large doll was released in two different boxes, the first lacking a window so buyers could not see the doll inside. As the doll was sold with three different wardrobes, buying one was a gamble regarding which look she would have (unless one read the small code box on the bottom of the package indicating the doll&#x27;s shoe color). The large doll later came in a window box with a simplified single wardrobe. The small dolls came boxed at first and then blister carded on two different types of cards. They are noted for being the only Rainbow Brite dolls ever produced with Dutch text on the packaging.

The Canadian importer was Irvine, a company which is currently still in business, and their product packaging was printed in both French and English texts. Ideal Toy Company was the importer for most of Western Europe, though Euro Play imported the line for Germany. The large doll was also distributed in Italy by GiG with only Italian text on the box. There were no other toys or accessories for the second generation dolls other than additional pots of Color-Glo Paint, which were sold in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. There was also a version of at least the large doll in a box with Spanish-only text. Another 15&quot; Rainbow Brite doll with a Color Glo Bear and paint set was prototyped, as was a black version, which was produced in very small numbers. But only the black version was ever produced and then in very limited numbers. There was a Gen 2B which had simplified packaging and outfits as an effort to keep the line going by cutting costs. The second generation had nowhere near the success the first generation had at retail and was discontinued after less than two years on the market.

===Third Generation: Toy Play===
The third Rainbow Brite generation (2003–2005) was also the 20th Anniversary Release. The master toy licensee was Toy Play, a defunct subsidiary of The Betesh Group. The parent company is still in business. Nick Jr. was the television network that advertised the line. Hot Topic was the lead merchandiser with a unique Rainbow Brite doll not manufactured by Toy Play and many items of women&#x27;s clothing, accessories and stationery.

Without being an exact copy of the originals, this generation returned to the look and feel of the Mattel line even if the product line was much narrower than the first generation. Toy Play followed the first generation&#x27;s character roll out, producing Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Canary Yellow and Patty O&#x27;Green characters but no more Color Kids followed. Starlite, Puppy Brite and the Sprites were also represented in various merchandise.

Characters were produced in different sizes, from three to twenty-eight inches tall across the line which went from PVC plastic figurines to plush dolls. Toy Play produced both retro-style plush dolls with wiring in their limbs to make them poseable along with plastic dolls wearing soft clothing and having articulated arms and legs. Some dolls were sold with a Region 1 DVD in English featuring a single episode of the original cartoon. Some Toy Play products were sold in Canada with English-French packaging. Toy Play&#x27;s 18 inch talking Rainbow Brite doll notoriously omitted the color green when &#x27;speaking&#x27; all of the colors of the rainbow. Toy Play indicated that the missing color would be added for future production runs, but this never happened because the line died out before a corrected version appeared.

Toy Play was the first (and so far only) merchandiser to produce a Color Castle playset, the Light Up Musical Castle, which included small articulated figurines of Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Twink and Puppy Brite. The playset&#x27;s box showed pictures of forthcoming product (a Rainbow Brite and Friends Sprites&#x27; village playset, an in-scale Starlite with brushable mane, as well as figurine 2-packs to include Rainbow Brite and Twink, Red Butler and Romeo, Patty O&#x27;Green and Lucky, Canary Yellow and Spark, and Murky Dismal and Lurky) though these were never produced. There was also a wide range of other merchandise, mostly clothing, that was available during Gen 3.

===Fourth Generation: Playmates Toys===
The fourth Rainbow Brite generation (2009–2010) was the 25th anniversary release and was accompanied by a series of web-episodes produced by Animax Entertainment that were available to stream on www.RainbowBrite.com., which no longer exists. The master toy license belonged to Playmates Toys and their line of Rainbow Brite toys was expected to be in stores in the fall of 2009. Production delays saw the line actually debut in stores on December 24 of that year, which of course missed the 2009 holiday shopping season.

The line&#x27;s initial product release only included three plastic fashion dolls (Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow) and three plastic horses with rooted manes (Starlite, Sunriser, and Shimmer). A larger 15&quot; Rainbow Brite doll was also produced. The line initially omitted the Color Kids altogether in favor of a more sky-power oriented storyline. The packaging art hinted at a possible Stormy doll to come, though yet again she never arrived.

The Playmates line never caught on with its target audience. Most retailers refused to carry the line and those that did saw stock run out by July 2010. If any reorders were placed, they were not in quantities that justified continued production. The line was only on the market for about seven months and was not available in all of the Contiguous United States.

In the Fall of 2010 three Sprite dolls appeared at retail in Mexico. These included Twinkle (a renamed Twink) for Rainbow Brite, Nite Sprite for Moonglow and Twilite for Tickled Pink. These were already in production when US retailers dropped the line. The fourth generation saw a number of licensed products similar to the third generation, some in the original Gen 1 style and some in the new Gen 4 style. This included mostly clothing and stationary, plus a small bicycle. The final products during the fourth generation came from Madame Alexander, and included a traditional Madame Alexander-style Gen 1 Rainbow Brite doll with Twink, as well as Gen 4-style plush dolls of Rainbow Brite and Tickled Pink. 
===Feeln===

A three-part animated miniseries was launched on November 6, 2014 by Video On Demand site Feeln. The reboot showcased updated character designs for the cast, and starred Emily Osment as the voice of Rainbow Brite and Molly Ringwald as the voice of Dark Princess. The second episode was shown on November 13, 2014 and the series concluded on November 20, 2014.

===Fifth Generation: Hallmark Toys===
Hallmark introduced the fifth generation of Rainbow Brite toys, along with clothing and other merchandise in July 2015. A limited edition line of Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys featuring Rainbow Brite, Twink, Champ, O.J., Lucky and I.Q. arrived first, each produced in limited quantities of 500 units. The demand led to Hallmark reissuing the Itty Bittys with slightly revised designs in much greater numbers along with the first Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys boxed set featuring Red Butler, Romeo, Indigo and Hammy. These items were followed by an 8&quot; Twink plush and 11&quot; Starlite plush in September 2015, as well as a 16&quot; Rainbow Brite doll that November.

In 2016 Hallmark released another Itty Bitty boxed set featuring Patty O&#x27;Green, Buddy Blue, Lucky &amp; Champ. A 24&quot; Rainbow Brite Jumbo Itty Bitty arrived in December. A limited edition Shy Violet Itty Bitty was released as a Hallmark online exclusive that Summer. In Fall of 2016 many new Rainbow Brite items were available at Hallmark stores and online, including several new story and activity books, a new range of greeting cards, and a 1,000 piece Rainbow Land puzzle. A Starlite Itty Bitty was released in November, as well as 11&quot; Sunriser and Skydancer plushes, and for the first time ever a 16&quot; Stormy doll. Packaging for the single items consists only of attached tags with the product name, Hallmark logo, copyright notice and barcode, while the boxed sets feature Rainbow Land displayable backgrounds. These toys are sold only in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Hallmark Keepsake Rainbow Brite holiday ornaments were sold in 2015 (a reissue of Hallmark&#x27;s 2013 ornament) and 2016.

A Rainbow Brite comic was published by Dynamite Entertainment for five issues from October 2018 to February 2019.

===Upcoming Sixth Generation===
On October 14, 2024, it was announced a CGI-animated series and theatrical film are currently in the works. The film will be produced by Hallmark, Crayola Studios and Original Film with Neal H. Moritz and Toby Ascher on board, while the series will be produced by Cake Entertainment. Crayola will also handle the licensing and merchandising for the new series.

<text>Robert Jungk (; born &quot;Robert Baum&quot;, also known as &quot;Robert Baum-Jungk&quot;; 11 May 1913 – 14 July 1994) was an Austrian writer, journalist, historian and peace campaigner. He wrote mostly on matters relating to nuclear weapons.

==Life==
Jungk was born into a Jewish family in Berlin. His father, known as Max Jungk, was born David Baum in Bohemia.

When Adolf Hitler came to power, Robert Jungk was arrested and released, moved to Paris, then back to Nazi Germany to work in a subversive press service. These activities forced him during World War II to move through various cities including Prague, Paris, and Zürich. After the war, he continued working as a journalist.

His book &quot;Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, was the first published account of the Manhattan Project and the German atomic bomb project. Its first Danish edition implied that the German project&#x27;s workers had been dissuaded from developing a weapon by Werner Heisenberg and his associates, a claim strongly contested by the Danish 1922 Physics Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr. This led to questions about a 1941 meeting between Bohr and Heisenberg in Copenhagen, Denmark, which became the subject of Michael Frayn&#x27;s 1998 play &quot;Copenhagen&quot;.

In 1986 Jungk received the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;struggling indefatigably on behalf of peace, sane alternatives for the future and ecological awareness.&quot;

In 1992 he made an unsuccessful bid for the Austrian presidency on behalf of the Green Party.

Jungk died in Salzburg on 14 July 1994.

== Personal life ==
In 1948 Jungk married Ruth Suschitzky (1913–1995). Their son is journalist and writer Peter Stephan Jungk.

== Bibliography ==
* &quot;Tomorrow Is Already Here&quot;, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1954. Reportage on scientific and technical breakthroughs, a work of nascent dystopian &#x27;futurism&#x27;. Much of it was about what developed from the Manhattan Project, as well as things like &quot;electronic brains&quot;.
* &quot;Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, New York: Harcourt Brace, 1958
* &quot;Children of the Ashes&quot;, 1st English ed. 1961. About Hiroshima
* &quot;The Nuclear State&quot;
* &quot;The Everyman Project&quot;
* &quot;Future Workshops&quot;

==Recognition==

* 1970: Honorary Professor at Technische Universität Berlin
* 1986: Right Livelihood Award
* 1989: Honorary Citizen of the City of Salzburg
* 1992: Alternative Büchner Prize
* 1993: Honorary Doctor of the University of Osnabrück

<text>The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) is a natural history museum administered by the Smithsonian Institution, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States. It has free admission and is open 364 days a year. With 4.4 million visitors in 2023, it was the third most-visited museum in the United States. 

Opened in 1910, the museum on the National Mall was one of the first Smithsonian buildings constructed exclusively to hold the national collections and research facilities. The main building has an overall area of with of exhibition and public space and houses over 1,000 employees.

The museum&#x27;s collections contain over 146 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, the largest natural history collection in the world. It is also home to about 185 professional natural history scientists—the largest group of scientists dedicated to the study of natural and cultural history in the world.

==History==

===1846–1911===
The United States National Museum was founded in 1846 as part of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum was initially housed in the Smithsonian Institution Building, which is better known today as the Smithsonian Castle. A formal exhibit hall opened in 1858. The growing collection led to the construction of a new building, the National Museum Building (known today as the Arts and Industries Building). Covering a then-enormous , it was built in just 15 months at a cost of $310,000. It opened in March 1881.

Congress authorized construction of a new building on June 28, 1902. On January 29, 1903, a special committee composed of members of Congress and representatives from the Smithsonian&#x27;s board of regents published a report asking Congress to fund a much larger structure than originally planned. The regents began considering sites for the new building in March, and by April 12 settled on a site on the north side of B Street NW between 9th and 12th Streets. The D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower &amp; Marshall was chosen to design the structure. Testing of the soil for the foundations was set for July 1903, with construction expected to take three years.
The Natural History Building (as the National Museum of Natural History was originally known) opened its doors to the public on March 17, 1910, in order to provide the Smithsonian Institution with more space for collections and research. The building was not fully completed until June 1911. The structure cost $3.5 million (about $85 million in inflation-adjusted 2012) dollars. The Neoclassical style building was the first structure constructed on the north side of the National Mall as part of the 1901 McMillan Commission plan. In addition to the Smithsonian&#x27;s natural history collection, it also housed the American history, art, and cultural collections.

===1981–2003===
Between 1981 and 2003, the National Museum of Natural History had 11 permanent and acting directors. The directors included: Richard S. Fiske (1980-1985); James C. Tyler (acting, 1985 and 1988); and Robert S. Hoffmann (1985-1988).

Frank Talbot, ichthyologist and former director of the Australian Museum and California Academy of Sciences, served as director from 1989 until 1994. He was the first (and as of 2024 the only) Australian to ever be appointed to this role. 

Two acting directors (Donald J. Ortner, 1994-1996, and David L. Pawson in 1996) served before Robert W. Fri was named the museum&#x27;s director in 1996. One of the largest donations in Smithsonian history was made during Fri&#x27;s tenure. Kenneth E. Behring donated $20 million in 1997 to modernize the museum. Fri resigned in 2001 after disagreeing with Smithsonian leadership over the reorganization of the museum&#x27;s scientific research programs.

J. Dennis O&#x27;Connor, provost of the Smithsonian Institution (where he oversaw all science and research programs) was named acting director of the museum on July 25, 2001. Eight months later, O&#x27;Conner resigned to become the vice president of research and dean of the graduate school at the University of Maryland. Douglas Erwin, a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History, was appointed interim director in June 2002.

===2003–2007===
In January 2003, the Smithsonian announced that Cristián Samper, a Colombian with an M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, would become the museum&#x27;s permanent director on March 31, 2003. Samper (who holds dual citizenship with Colombia and the United States) founded the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute and ran the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute after 2001. Smithsonian officials said Samper&#x27;s administrative experience proved critical in his appointment. Under Samper&#x27;s direction, the museum opened the $100 million Behring Hall of Mammals in November 2003, received $60 million in 2004 for the Sant Hall of Oceans, and received a $1 million gift from Tiffany &amp; Co. for the purchase of precious gems for the National Gem Collection.
On March 25, 2007, Lawrence M. Small, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the organization&#x27;s highest-ranking appointed official, resigned abruptly after public reports of lavish spending.

===2007–2012===
On March 27, 2007, Samper was appointed Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian. Paul G. Risser, former chancellor of the University of Oklahoma, was named acting director of the Museum of Natural History on March 29.

In May 2007, Robert Sullivan, the former associate director in charge of exhibitions at the National Museum of Natural History, charged that Samper and Smithsonian Undersecretary for Science David Evans (Samper&#x27;s supervisor) ordered &quot;last minute&quot; changes in the exhibit &quot;Arctic: A Friend Acting Strangely&quot; to tone down the role of human beings in the discussion of global warming, and to make global warming seem more uncertain than originally depicted. Samper denied that he knew of any scientific objections to the changes, and said that no political pressure had been applied to the Smithsonian to make the changes. In November 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that an interagency group of scientists from the Department of the Interior, NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Science Foundation believed that, despite Samper&#x27;s denial, the museum &quot;acted to avoid criticism from congressional appropriators and global-warming skeptics in the Bush administration&quot;. The changes were discussed as early as mid-August 2005, and Dr. Waleed Abdalati, manager of NASA&#x27;s Cryospheric Sciences Program, noted at the time that &quot;There was some discussion of the political sensitivities of the exhibit.&quot;

Although the exhibit was due to open in October 2005, the &quot;Post&quot; reported that Samper ordered a six-month delay to allow for even further changes. The newspaper also reported that it had obtained a memo drafted by Samper shortly after October 15, 2005, in which Samper said the museum should not &quot;replicate&quot; work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A few weeks later, a NOAA climate researcher advised a superior that the delay was due to &quot;the debate within the administration and the science community over the existence and cause of global warming&quot;. During the delay, Samper asked high-level officials in other government agencies and departments to review the script for the exhibit, ordered his museum staff to make additional changes, and rearranged the sequence of the exhibit panels so that the discussion of climate change was not immediately encountered by museum visitors. Shortly before the exhibit opened in April 2006, officials at NOAA and the United States Department of Commerce expressed to their superiors their opinion that the exhibit had been changed to accommodate political concerns. In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in November 2007, Samper said he felt the exhibit displayed a scientific certainty that did not exist, and expressed his belief that the museum should present evidence on both sides and let the public make up its own mind.

The issue became more heated after the press reported that Samper gave permission for the museum to accept a $5 million donation from American Petroleum Institute that would support the museum&#x27;s soon-to-be-opened Hall of Oceans. Two members of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Board of Regents (which had final say on accepting the donation) questioned whether the donation was a conflict of interest. Before the board could consider the donation, the donor withdrew the offer.
Risser resigned as acting director of the museum on January 22, 2008, in order to return to his position at the University of Oklahoma. No new acting director was named at that time. Six weeks later, the Smithsonian regents chose Georgia Tech president G. Wayne Clough as the new Secretary. Samper stepped down to return to his position as Director of the National Museum of Natural History.

In June 2008, the Victoria and Roger Sant family donated $15 million to endow the new Ocean Hall at the museum. The museum celebrated the 50th anniversary of its acquisition of the Hope Diamond in August 2009 by giving the gemstone its own exhibit and a new setting. In March 2010, the museum opened its $21 million human evolution hall.

In January 2012, Samper said he was stepping down from the National Museum of Natural History to become president and chief executive officer of the Wildlife Conservation Society. Two months later, the museum announced it had received a $35 million gift to renovate its dinosaur hall, and a month later the Sant family donated another $10 million to endow the director&#x27;s position. On July 25, 2012, Kirk Johnson, vice president of research and collections at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, was named Samper&#x27;s successor effective October 29, 2012. By 2013, as Sant Director, Johnson oversaw a museum with 460 employees and a $68 million budget. A four-year strategic plan was released in 2021. The museum&#x27;s Mall building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2023.

==Research and collections==
Research in the museum is divided into seven departments: anthropology, botany, entomology, invertebrate zoology, mineral sciences, paleobiology, vertebrate zoology.

The NMNH represents 90% of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s collections and forms one of the largest, most comprehensive natural history collection in the world. The Smithsonian gives an approximate number for artifacts and specimens of 146 million. More specifically, the collections include 30 million insects, 4.5 million plants preserved in the Museum&#x27;s herbarium, and 7 million fish stored in liquid-filled jars. The National Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles has more than tripled from 190,000 specimen records 1970 to over 580,000 specimen records in 2020. Of the 2 million cultural artifacts, 400,000 are photographs housed in the National Anthropological Archives. Through off-site active loan and exchange programs, the museum&#x27;s collections can be accessed. As a result, 3.5 million specimens are out on loan every year. The rest of the collections not on display are stored in the non-public research areas of the museum and at the Museum Support Center, located in Suitland, Maryland. Other facilities include a marine science center in Ft. Pierce, Florida and field stations in Belize, Alaska, and Kenya.

The museum is estimated to hold more than 5000 Native American remains that have not been repatriated. Some of these may belong to the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

One collection of nearly a million specimens of birds, reptiles, and mammals kept at the museum has been maintained by the Biological Survey unit of the U.S. Geological Survey. This division had started in 1885 as an economic ornithology unit of the Agriculture Department. Clarence Birdseye and Clinton Hart Merriam had worked in this organization. As of February 2018, the unit&#x27;s funding is planned to be cut, and it is not clear what would happen to the collection.

==Exhibitions==

===Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals===
The National Gem and Mineral Collection is one of the most significant collections of its kind in the world. There are currently over 15,000 individual gems in the collection, as well as 350,000 minerals and 300,000 samples of rock and ore specimens. Additionally, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Gem and Mineral Collection houses approximately 45,000 meteorite specimens, including examples of every known type of meteorite, and is considered to be one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world. The collection includes some of the most famous pieces of gems and minerals, including the Hope Diamond and the Star of Asia (one of the largest sapphires in the world), and the Carmen Lúcia Ruby, one of the largest and most valuable Burmese rubies in the world.

The collection is displayed in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, one of the many galleries in the Museum of Natural History. Some of the most important donors, besides Hooker, are Washington Roebling, the man who built the Brooklyn Bridge, who gave 16,000 specimens to the collection; Frederick A. Canfield, who donated 9,000 specimens to the collection; and Isaac Lea, who donated the basis of the museum&#x27;s collection of 1312 gems and minerals.

===Hall of Human Origins===

The David H. Koch &quot;Hall of Human Origins&quot; opened on March 17, 2010, marking the museum&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The hall is named for David H. Koch, who contributed $15 million to the $20.7 million exhibit.

The Hall is &quot;dedicated to the discovery and understanding of human origins,&quot; and occupies of exhibit space. This exhibit includes 76 humans skulls, each of a different species, eons apart. Each of these species is a human, signified by the &quot;Homo&quot; genus name. One species that can be found in this gallery is the &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, which lived 200,000–700,000 years ago. In addition, there is a female skull from &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, a human species that possibly only went extinct just 17,000 years ago. The exhibit includes an interactive human family tree that follows six million years of evolution, and a &quot;Changing the World&quot; gallery that focuses on issues surrounding climate change and humans&#x27; impact on the world. 
The Hall&#x27;s core concept idea is &quot;What Does It Mean To Be Human&quot;, and focuses on milestones of human evolution such as walking upright, bigger brains, and symbolic thought.
Also covered is the Smithsonian&#x27;s significant research on the geological and climate changes which occurred in East Africa during significant periods of Human Evolution. 
The exhibit highlights an actual fossil Neanderthal and replicas created by famed paleoartist, John Gurche. 
The exhibit has been criticized for downplaying the significance of human-caused global warming.

The exhibit also provides a complementary web site, which provides diaries and podcasts directly from related fields of research. 
The companion book, &quot;What Does It Mean To Be Human&quot;, was written by Richard (Rick) Potts, the curator, and Christopher Sloan. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.

===Deep Time Exhibit/Fossil Hall===
The Hall of Dinosaurs has fossilized skeletons and cast models, including a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; cast facing a &quot;Triceratops&quot; cast. This &quot;Triceratops&quot; exhibit shows the first accurate dinosaur skeleton in virtual motion, achieved through the use of scanning and digital technology.&quot; The collection consists of 46 &quot;complete and important specimens&quot; of dinosaurs.

In May 2012, billionaire David H. Koch donated $35 million toward the cost of a $45 million upgrade to the 30-year-old, dinosaur hall. The hall closed in April 2014 and reopened in June 2019.

In June 2013, the Smithsonian obtained a 50-year lease on a &quot;T. rex&quot; fossil skeleton owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It is the first &quot;T. rex&quot; skeleton to be displayed at the museum, which until now has only had the cast of a skull. The specimen, known as the &quot;Wankel&quot; or &quot;Devil&quot; rex, was found on Corps-owned land in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in Montana in 1988. It has since been on display at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana (which helped excavate the fossil). The &quot;Wankel rex&quot; (whose skeleton is 85 percent complete) was to be unveiled at the Museum of Natural History on National Fossil Day, October 16, 2013, and was supposed to be on display until the dinosaur hall exhibit closed for renovation in the spring of 2014. The long skeleton is the centerpiece of the dinosaur hall since it re-opened in 2019. The Museum of the Rockies (which did not own the skeleton but was the repository for it) has about a dozen &quot;T. rex&quot; specimens, including one which is eighty percent complete. Only about six museums in the United States have a &quot;T. rex&quot; skeleton. The Museum of the Rockies is a Smithsonian affiliate museum, and had long promised to find a &quot;T. rex&quot; for the Smithsonian to display.

Due to the 2013 federal government shutdown, the fossil did not arrive in Washington, D.C. Smithsonian officials said it remained in storage in Montana, and would not arrive at the Smithsonian until late spring 2014. Packed up in 16 crates, the &quot;T. rex&quot;, named &quot;Nation&#x27;s T. rex&quot; by the Smithsonian, traveled from the Museum of the Rockies and arrived at the National Museum of Natural History on April 15, 2014. The &quot;T. rex&quot; was displayed in the Rex Room, while specialists performed a conservation assessment and the Smithsonian Digitization Program scanned each bone, to create a 3-D model for research. The Nation&#x27;s T. rex is the centerpiece of the new fossil hall, which opened in 2019.

===Hall of Mammals===

The Behring Hall of Mammals was designed by Reich + Petch. The mammal specimens are presented as works of modern art within minimal environmentals. Visitors discover mammal&#x27;s evolutionary adaptions to hugely diverse contexts.

The museum has the largest collection of vertebrate specimens in the world, nearly twice the size of the next largest mammal collections, including historically important collections from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its collection was initiated by C. Hart Merriam and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (later the Department of the Interior), which expanded it in the 1890s-1930s.

===Insect Zoo===
The O. Orkin Insect Zoo features live insects and exhibits about insects and entomologists. Different habitats have been created to show the type of insects that live in different environments and how they have adapted to a freshwater pond, house, mangrove swamp, desert, and rain forest. The zoo is sponsored by Orkin, a pest control company.

===Ocean Hall===

The Sant Ocean Hall opened on September 27, 2008, and is the largest renovation of the museum since it opened in 1910. The hall includes 674 marine specimens and models drawn from the over 80 million specimens in the museum&#x27;s total collection, the largest in the world. The hall is named for the Roger Sant family, who donated $15 million to endow the new hall and other related programs.

The collection includes: a North Atlantic right whale, a giant Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish model, a aquarium containing live marine fish and corals, one female giant squid displayed in the center of the hall and a male displayed off to the side, an adult coelenterate, and a &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;.

The museum also provides the Smithsonian Ocean Portal, a complementary web site that provides regularly updated, original content from the museum&#x27;s research, collections, and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by more than 20 collaborating organizations, including Archive, Census of Marine Life, Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Encyclopedia of Life, INDUCT, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, National Geographic, NOAA, New England Aquarium, Ocean Conservancy, Oceania, Pew Charitable Trusts, Sea Web, Save Our Seas, Scrips Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, World Heritage Marine Programmer.

===African Voices===
This exhibit and associated website &quot;examines the diversity, dynamism, and global influence of Africa&#x27;s peoples and cultures over time in the realms of family, work, community, and the natural environment.&quot;
===Butterflies + Plants: Partners In Evolution===
The Butterflies + Plants is a live butterfly pavilion which allows &quot;visitors to observe the many ways in which butterflies and other animals have evolved, adapted, and diversified together with their plant partners over tens of millions of years.&quot; The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.

===Bone Hall===
This exhibit displays a &quot;variety of vertebrate skeletons grouped by their evolutionary relationships.&quot;

===Q?rius===
Opened since 2013, this exhibit is the museum&#x27;s interactive and educational area. Using microscopes and touch screens, the area hosts various interactive activities and puzzles visitors can experience and contains a &quot;collection zone&quot; that houses over 6000 different specimens and artifacts visitors are able personally handle. The area also hosts various events such as allowing visitors to meet and discuss with Smithsonian scientists and hosting school groups.

=== Former exhibits ===

==== Western Cultures Hall ====
&quot;This hall explores some examples from various cultures in the western world including northern Iraq, ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome and the recent discovery of the Iceman, a Copper Age mummy found in an Italian glacier.&quot; This exhibit was closed on September 26, 2010.

==== Korea Gallery ====
The Korea Gallery was a special showcase to celebrate Korean traditions and examine its unique influence and complex role in the world today.

The exhibit expressed the continuity of the past by highlighting enduring features of Korean culture over 2,600 years. The exhibit used the Smithsonian ceramics collection as well as a rich selection of photographs, ritual objects and traditional Korean carpentry to communicate and connect to both the local Korean community and an international audience. Traditional art forms, such as ceramics and calligraphy, along with mythological figures, language, large feature photographs and illustrations spoke to a range of shared historical memories which connected Koreans at home and abroad.

Personal stories of modern Koreans, as told in their own voices, provide a context to discuss some of the many issues that face the divided country today. Korea&#x27;s incredible transformation from &#x27;The Hermit Kingdom&#x27; to a world power is traced through its impact on the arts, the economy and popular culture. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch. This exhibit closed in 2017.

==Facility ==
In the lower level, there is a bird exhibit, Urban Bird Habitat Garden, with all the migratory and native birds to Washington, D.C.

The Global Volcanism Program is housed in the department of Mineral Sciences.

The museum frequently hosts sleepovers through the Smithsonian Associates for children ages 8–12.

=== Baird Auditorium ===

Beneath the building&#x27;s rotunda is the Baird Auditorium, named for the second Secretary of the Smithsonian Spencer Fullerton Baird. The Baird Auditorium was completed in 1909, designed and built by the R. Guastavino Company under the direction of Rafael Guastavino, Jr. using Catalan vault tile ceiling. The American Institute of Architects calls the Baird Auditorium the museum&#x27;s &quot;greatest interior space.&quot; According to architectural scholar Dr. John Ochsendorf, the Baird Auditorium&#x27;s &quot;daring geometry&quot; in tile construction by the Guastavino company &quot;spans 90 feet (27 meters) with a remarkable shallow dome in acoustical tile, and could only have been built by a company with decades of experience in tile vaulting.&quot;

==== Baird Auditorium Events ====
The Baird Auditorium has a long history of performances and events. The Baird was the location of the astronomical &#x27;Great Debate,&#x27; also called the &#x27;Shapley–Curtis Debate,&#x27; on April 26, 1920 on the topics of spiral nebulae and the size of the universe. Merle Travis gave a country guitar music concert in the Baird Auditorium on October 23, 1976. In early February 1977, Muddy Waters performed in the Baird as part of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s blues series presented by the Division of Performing Arts.

<text>Mr Yasuyoshi Komizo [[[:ja:小溝泰義|ja]]], Secretary General of Mayors for Peace Secretariat, Hiroshima (left) and [[Lassina Zerbo]], Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (2017)
Mayors for Peace &quot;(founded as The World Conference of Mayors for Peace through Inter-city Solidarity, renamed in 2001&quot;&quot;)&quot; is an international organization of cities dedicated to the promotion of peace that was established in 1982 at the initiative of then Mayor of Hiroshima Takeshi Araki, in response to the deaths of around 140,000 people due to the atomic bombing of the city on August 6, 1945.

The current mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, is the President of the organization as of his April 2011 inauguration.

Mayors for Peace was started in Japan, and since then Mayors throughout the World have signed on. When Mayors sign on, it means they support the commencement of negotiations towards the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020.

In August 2023, Mayors for Peace counted over 8,200 member cities in 166 countries and territories around the world.

== The Mayors for Peace 2020 Vision Campaign ==
The 2020 Vision Campaign is the main vehicle for advancing the agenda of Mayors for Peace, a nuclear-weapon-free world by the year 2020. It was initiated on a provisional basis by the Executive Cities of Mayors for Peace at their meeting in Manchester, UK, in October 2003. It was launched under the name &#x27;Emergency Campaign to Ban Nuclear Weapons&#x27; in November of that year at the 2nd Citizens Assembly for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons held in Nagasaki, Japan. In August 2005, the World Conference endorsed continuation of the Campaign under the title of the &#x27;2020 Vision Campaign&#x27;.

From May 2008 till May 2009, the main focus of the work of the 2020 Vision Campaign has been the signature drive for the Cities Appeal in support of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol. The Protocol embeds the objective of the 2020 Vision Campaign in a realistic framework. As a protocol to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it seeks to challenge national governments to follow through on the commitments they made in Article VI the Treaty.

By signing the Cities Appeal, Mayors and elected local officials around the world are given the chance to get behind the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol ahead of the formal and final presentation of the results of the international signature drive at the 2010 NPT Review Conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

In western Massachusetts, a campaign was spearheaded from grassroots organizers in eleven towns. After two years of hard working starting in the autumn of 2005 and continuing today, all eleven Western Mayors have signed on to the campaign.

This encouraged some legislative action, and the state Republicans brought forth a resolution for nuclear abolition by 2020 which passed in the Massachusetts House and Senate. Senator Ted Kennedy was asked to bring the resolution to the federal level. However, after Kennedy died, there are no plans to see the resolution at a national level.

== 2011 Nobel Peace Prize nomination ==
Mayors for Peace were nominated for 2011 Nobel Peace Prize by 1976 Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire. Maguire, who nominated Mayors for Peace and Nihon Hidankyo jointly for the prize, said she believes that &quot;both organizations have fulfilled the wish of Alfred Nobel to work for peace and disarmament and awarding the prize jointly to them would recognize the great sacrifice of especially the &quot;hibakusha&quot; and give support and encouragement to all working on one of the greatest challenges to humanity – to rid the world of all nuclear weapons and build peace amongst the human family.&quot;

<text>was the mayor of Hiroshima from 1975 to 1991.

In April 1947, he was elected as member of the Hiroshima city council, and as member of the Hiroshima Prefectural Assembly in 1951.

==Mayor of Hiroshima==
Araki was elected mayor of Hiroshima in 1975. In 1976, he protested the air show held in Texas, in which the US Air Force held an imitation of the atomic attack on Hiroshima in the form of a mushroom cloud in the desert, and in 1977 protested to the Japanese government about the possibility of further such reenactments. As a mayor, Araki approached the US government to work for nuclear disarmament. On November 26, 1976, he held a meeting in Washington D.C., with head of Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Fred Ikle, a meeting attended also by mayor Yoshitake Morotani of Nagasaki with the purpose of promoting US policy of nuclear disarmament. On November 30, the two mayors met US Permanent Representative to the UN William Scranton and conveyed the same message. The two mayors met UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim on December 3. Araki later described his meeting with Waldheim as follows:

There we, as survivors, living witnesses, testified the true facts of our atomic bomb experiences, and we strongly appealed for the total abolition of nuclear weapons and the renunciation of war.

To this appeal of ours, both Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim and President H.S. Amerasinghe of the General Assembly, representing the United Nations, respectively emphasized that the sufferings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are sufferings to be shared by the whole of mankind, and that a new concept of world order should be built from the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They deeply sympathized with us, expressing their earnest desire to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In May 1978, spoke at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, dealing with disarmament, and was the first Mayor of Hiroshima to appear at an official UN session.

Being a hibakusha himself, he helped found the organization Mayors for Peace in 1982. He also concluded a number of Sister City agreements with Hannover, Germany (1983) and Chongqing, People&#x27;s Republic of China (1986).

==Death==
Araki died of pneumonia on June 15, 1994. His public funeral was held on July 8, 1995.

<text>The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden is an art museum beside the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States. The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States&#x27; museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the post–World War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years.

The Hirshhorn is situated halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, anchoring the southernmost end of the so-called L&#x27;Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall&#x27;s green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre L&#x27;Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan.

The building itself is an attraction, an open cylinder elevated on four massive &quot;legs&quot;, with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard.

== History ==
===Founding===
In the late 1930s, the United States Congress mandated an art museum for the National Mall. At the time, the only venue for visual art was the National Gallery of Art, which focuses on Dutch, French, and Italian art. During the 1940s World War II shifted the project into the background.

Meanwhile, Joseph H. Hirshhorn, then in his forties and enjoying great success from uranium-mining investments, began creating his collection from classic French Impressionism to works by living artists, American modernism of the early 20th century, and sculpture. Then, in 1955, Hirshhorn sold his uranium interests for more than $50-million. He expanded his collection to warehouses, an apartment in New York City, and an estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, with extensive area for sculpture.

A 1962 sculpture show at New York&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum awakened an international art community to the breadth of Hirshhorn&#x27;s holdings. Word of his collection of modern and contemporary paintings also circulated, and institutions in Italy, Israel, Canada, California, and New York City vied for the collection. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley successfully campaigned for a new museum on the National Mall.

In 1966, an Act of Congress established the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution. Most of the funding was federal, but Hirshhorn later contributed $1-million toward construction. Joseph and his fourth wife, Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn, visited the White House. The groundbreaking was in 1969 and Abram Lerner was named the founding director. He oversaw research, conservation, and installation of more than 6,000 items brought from the Hirshhorns&#x27; Connecticut estate and other properties to Washington, DC.

Joseph Hirshhorn spoke at the inauguration (1974), saying:

One million visitors saw the 850-work inaugural show in the first six months.

===Institutional leadership===

In 1984, James T. Demetrion, who had served as director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa for 14 years, succeeded Abram Lerner as the Hirshhorn&#x27;s director. Art collector and retail store founder Sydney Lewis of Richmond, Virginia, succeeded Senator Daniel P. Moynihan as board chairman. Demetrion held the post for more than 17 years.

Ned Rifkin became director in February 2002, returning to the Hirshhorn after directorship positions at the Menil Collection in Texas and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. Rifkin was previously chief curator of the Hirshhorn from 1986 until 1991. In October 2003, Rifkin was named Under Secretary for Art of the Smithsonian.

In 2005, Olga Viso was named director of the Hirshhorn. Viso joined the curatorial department of the Hirshhorn in 1995 as assistant curator, was named associate curator in 1998, and served as curator of contemporary art from 2000 to 2003. In October 2003, Viso was named deputy director of the Hirshhorn, a post she held until her 2005 promotion to director. After two years, Ms. Viso accepted the position of director at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, departing in December 2007.

Chief Curator and Deputy Director Kerry Brougher served as acting director for more than a year until an international search led to the hiring of Richard Koshalek, who was named the fifth director of the Hirshhorn in February 2009.

Richard Koshalek (born 1942) was president of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, from 1999 until January 2009. Before that, he served as director of The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. At both institutions, he was noted for his commitment to new artistic initiatives, including commissioned works, scholarly exhibitions and publications, and the building of new facilities that garnered architectural acclaim. He worked with architect Frank Gehry on the design and construction of MOCA&#x27;s Geffen Contemporary (1983), a renovated warehouse popularly known as the Temporary Contemporary. He also worked with the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki on the museum&#x27;s permanent home in Los Angeles (1986). Koshalek resigned in 2013 after the Bloomberg Bubble controversy (see below).

On June 5, 2014, Hirshhorn trustees announced that they had hired Melissa Chiu, director of Asia Society Museum in New York City, to be the Hirshhorn&#x27;s new director. Chiu, who was born in Darwin, Australia, is a scholar of contemporary Chinese art. Chiu oversaw the Hirshhorn&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebration in the fall of 2014. Chiu began her tenure at the Hirshhorn in September 2014.

===Collection highlights===
Notable artists in the collection include: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, Joseph Glasco, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, John Chamberlain, Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Milton Avery, Ellsworth Kelly, Ching Ho Cheng, Louise Nevelson, Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Larry Rivers, and Raphael Soyer among others. Outside the museum is a sculpture garden, featuring works by artists including Auguste Rodin, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean-Robert Ipoustéguy, Jeff Koons, and others.

Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Wish Tree for Washington, DC&quot;, a permanent installation in the Sculpture Garden (since 2007), now includes contributions from all over the world.

In 2018, the collection acquired its first piece of performance art, by Tino Sehgal: &quot;This You&quot; (2006), features a female singer performing outdoors.

In 2019, Barbara and Aaron Levine donated their entire Marcel Duchamp collection, one of the largest in the world, to the museum. The exhibit &quot;Marcel Duchamp: The Barbara and Aaron Levine Collection&quot; ran from November 9, 2019, to October 12, 2020.

===&quot;Bloomberg Bubble&quot; controversy===
In 2009, then Director Richard Koshalek announced that an inflatable structure would be erected over the Hirshhorn&#x27;s central plaza to create a new public space. The Seasonal Inflatable Structure, to be called the &quot;Bloomberg Bubble,&quot; was due to be erected in 2013 and would be inflated annually for one two-month period. It was supposed to create a 14,000-square-foot space for performance and lectures. Designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the proposal won a progressive architecture award from &quot;Architect&quot; magazine.

Hirshhorn officials began reconsidering the Bubble in 2013. Construction cost estimates for the structure more than tripled to $15.5 million from $5 million, and no major gifts for the project were received between 2010 and May 2013. A Hirshhorn study also concluded that the cost of programming (such as symposia and special events) using the Bubble were likely to run a $2.8 million annual deficit. The Hirshhorn&#x27;s board of directors evenly split on a vote to proceed with the project in May 2013. In the wake of the vote, seen as a referendum on his leadership, museum director Richard Koshalek announced he would resign by the end of 2013. Constance Caplan, chair of the museum&#x27;s board of trustees, resigned on July 8, 2013. She cited what the &quot;Washington Post&quot; characterized as &quot;a board, a museum and the larger Smithsonian Institution at a crossroads, roiled by a lack of transparency, trust, vision and good faith&quot;. Four of the board&#x27;s 15 members resigned between June 2012 and April 2013, and three more (including Caplan) in May, June and July 2013.

== Architecture==
The museum was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft (1909–1990) and provides of exhibition space inside and nearly four acres outside in its two-level Sculpture Garden and plaza. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a fortress of a building that works as a museum.&quot; An original plan with a reflecting pool across the Mall was approved in July 1967. When excavation started, a controversy arose, resulting in a revised design, with a smaller footprint, which was approved on July 1, 1971.

;Technical Information
* Building and walls surfaced with precast concrete aggregate of &quot;Swenson&quot; pink granite
* Building is in diameter; interior court, ; fountain, 
* Building is high, elevated on four massive, sculptural piers
* of exhibition space on three floors
* of total exhibition space, indoors and outdoors
* 274-seat auditorium (lower level)
* around and under the museum building
* 1.3-acre sculpture garden across Jefferson Drive sunken below street level, ramped for accessibility
* Second- and third-floor galleries have 15-foot-high walls, with exposed 3-foot-deep coffered ceilings
* Lower level includes exhibition space, storage, workshops, offices
* Fourth floor includes offices, storage

;Architectural timeline
* 1969. The Hirshhorn Museum groundbreaking takes place on the former site of the Army Medical Museum and Library (built 1887) after the brick structure is demolished. A controversy soon develops over naming a building on the historic National Mall after a living person, as well as the new federal museum&#x27;s modern look and intrusively expansive sculptural grounds.
* 1971. Amid this climate of controversy, Bunshaft&#x27;s original conception for the Sculpture Garden-an elongated, sunken rectangle crossing the Mall with a large reflecting pool-is abandoned. He prepares a new design based on an idea outlined by art critic Benjamin Forgey in a &quot;Washington Star&quot; article. The new adaptation shifts the garden&#x27;s Mall orientation from perpendicular to parallel and reduces its size from to . The design is deliberately stark, using gravel surfaces and minimal plantings to visually emphasize the works of art.
* 1974. The museum opens with three floors of painting galleries, a fountain plaza for sculpture, and the Sculpture Garden. In preparation for the opening, Hirshhorn curators and staff spend several months scrupulously planning the locations of artworks, both indoors and outdoors. Lightweight foam-core &quot;dummy&quot; sculptures are used to resolve the final placement of works in the garden. The originals, many of which had been airlifted from Hirshhorn&#x27;s Connecticut estate onto flatbed trucks for transport, are put into place in the weeks before the opening.
* 1981. Closed since the summer of 1979, the Sculpture Garden reopens in September after a renovation and redesign by Lester Collins, a well-known landscape architect and founder of the Innisfree Foundation. The design introduces plantings, paved surfaces, accessibility ramps, and areas of lawn.
* 1985. The Museum Shop is moved to the lobby, increasing exhibition space at its former location on the lower level.
* 1993. Closed since December 1991, the Hirshhorn Plaza reopens after a renovation and redesign by landscape architect James Urban. The area around and under the building is repaved in two tones of gray granite, and raised areas of grass and trees are added to the east and west.
* 2014. The Museum Shop is moved back to the lower level. The ongoing installation of Barbara Kruger&#x27;s Belief and Doubt connects the shop with the lower level exhibition space.
* 2021. Extensive restorations to the outer portion of the building begin, requiring extended closures. In December 2021, the National Capital Planning Commission approved a large scale redesign and renovation of the Sculpture Garden by artist Hiroshi Sugimoto. The redesign is set to reopen underground access from the Sculpture Garden to the Hirshhorn building. Sugimoto&#x27;s design was the subject of both criticism and critical approval from numerous artists, preservation groups, and academics due to its reimagining of the original Brutalist garden design.

;Comments and criticisms
* &quot;The whole complex has been designed as one composition ... Bunshaft&#x27;s design is not concerned with the grandeur of the Mall. It is concerned with the greater grandeur of his museum and it gives us an awful lot of beaux-arts pavement and pomposity that no longer seem to suit the taste and style of our times.&quot; Wolf Von Eckhardt, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, February 6, 1971.
* &quot;The circular plan is not only clear, but also provides a pleasant processional sequence that goes a long way. ... The fortress quality of the Hirshhorn suggests some rather obvious thoughts about the nature of housing art in our time. But the building&#x27;s architecture ... is less the product of a desire to make a statement ... than it is a logical progression in aesthetic development. ... &quot; Paul Goldberger, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, October 2, 1974.
* &quot;[The building] is known around Washington as the bunker or gas tank, lacking only gun emplacements or an Exxon sign ... It totally lacks the essential factors of esthetic strength and provocative vitality that make genuine &#x27;brutalism&#x27; a positive and rewarding style. This is born-dead, neo-penitentiary modern. Its mass is not so much aggressive or overpowering as merely leaden.&quot; Ada Louise Huxtable, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, October 6, 1974.
* &quot;The parched severity of [the original Sculpture Garden] was not without merit, but the appeal was more to the mind than to the senses, more theoretical than practical. ... The new design reinforces the identity of the garden as a welcoming urban park. ... [This] park for art ... serves the sculpture. The divisions of the space prove essential accents; artworks pop in and out of view as the spectator moves about the space. ... &quot; Benjamin Forgey, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, September 12, 1981.
* &quot;[The Hirshhorn is] the biggest piece of abstract art in town – a huge, hollowed cylinder raised on four massive piers, in absolute command of its walled compound on the Mall. ... The circular fountain ... is a grand concoction ... that for good reason has become the museum&#x27;s visual trademark.&quot; Benjamin Forgey, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, November 4, 1989.

==Management==
In 2013, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden drew around 645,000 visitors. It has a budget of $8 million, which does not include the $10 to $12 million in operational support supplied by the Smithsonian Institution.

In 2019, the museum drew around 890,000 visitors. The following year, the museum saw a significant decline in visitors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related museum closures. The Hirshhorn remained closed to the public from March 2020 until August 2021. In 2020, visitor numbers fell to around 133,000. In 2021, visitor numbers rose to around 167,000.

<doc id="700625" wikidata="Q1748964" url="?curid=700625" title="Zenit (rocket family)">
<text>Zenit (, ; meaning &quot;Zenith&quot;) was a family of space launch vehicles designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau in Dnipro, Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. Zenit was originally built in the 1980s for two purposes: as a liquid rocket booster for the Energia rocket and, equipped with a second stage, as a stand-alone middle-weight launcher with a payload greater than the 7 tonnes of the Soyuz but smaller than the 20 tonnes payload of the Proton. The last rocket family developed in the USSR, the Zenit was intended as an eventual replacement for the dated Soyuz and Proton families, and it would employ propellants which were safer and less toxic than the Proton&#x27;s nitrogen tetroxide/UDMH mix. Zenit was planned to take over crewed spaceship launches from Soyuz, but these plans were abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Many of components of the Zenit rockets were produced in Russia. The Ukrainian space industry was highly integrated with that of Russia due to its Soviet heritage, but that cooperation was interrupted by the Russo-Ukrainian War beginning in 2014, which has effectively led to a hiatus in the Zenit program. The subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw damage to its manufacturing facilities due to Russian missile strikes, and what survived those strikes pivoted to producing military weapons.

Zenit-3SL was launched by the Sea Launch consortium&#x27;s floating launch platform in the Pacific Ocean and Zenit-2 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. RD-171M engines of the Zenit&#x27;s first and second stages as well as the upper stage of the Zenit-3SL rocket were supplied by Russia. An improved Zenit-3SLB rocket was used for commercial launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome beginning in April 2008, marketed as Land Launch.

Zenit-3SL was launched 36 times with 32 successes, one partial success, and three failures. The first failure, the launch of a Hughes-built communications satellite owned by ICO Global Communications, occurred during the second commercial launch on March 12, 2000, and was blamed on a software error that failed to close a valve in the second stage of the rocket. The second failure occurred on January 30, 2007, when the rocket exploded on the Odyssey launch platform, seconds after engine ignition. The NSS-8 communication satellite on board was destroyed.

On September 24, 2011 Zenit-3SL launched successfully from the Odyssey launch platform under a renewed Sea Launch project with RSC Energia as the majority stakeholder. The rocket delivered the European communication satellite Atlantic Bird 7 to its planned orbit. On February 1, 2013, another Zenit-3SL failed while launching the Intelsat 27 satellite.

== History ==

The Zenit-2 was the first Zenit to be designed for use as an orbital carrier rocket. It consists of two stages. The first uses an RD-171 engine, and an RD-120 engine powers the second stage. It first flew on 13 April 1985, two years before the Energia, due to delays relating to the Energia&#x27;s development. Zenit-2 would be certified for crewed launches and placed in specially built launch pad at Baykonur spaceport, carrying the new crewed partially reusable Zarya spacecraft that developed in end of the 1980s but was canceled. Also in the 1980s Vladimir Chelomey&#x27;s firm proposed never realised 15-ton Uragan spaceplane launched by Zenit-2.

Two launch facilities were constructed for the Zenit at Baikonour, however the second was only ever used twice. On October 4, 1990, an attempted launch of a Tselina-2 naval reconnaissance satellite ended in disaster as the booster suffered a first stage engine failure seconds into launch and fell back onto the pad, which was severely damaged in the ensuing explosion. The failure was traced to a leak in a LOX line that caused a fire in the thrust section of the booster. Estimated repair costs were about 45 million rubles, but the collapse of the Soviet Union meant that there were no funds available, so the pad was abandoned.

Following two failures in 1991–92 both caused by the second stage, the Zenit was on the verge of being cancelled entirely, but a successful flight in November 1992 saved the program.

The rate of Zenit launches slowed to a trickle during the 1990s due to the severely cash-strapped Russian Federation, and also because of Russia&#x27;s reluctance to fly military payloads on a booster manufactured in now-independent Ukraine. On May 20, 1997, a launch of a Tselina-2 satellite failed when the first stage shut down 48 seconds into launch. The booster crashed downrange.

During the 2000s, Zenit would find a new lease on life as the basis of the international Sea Launch project whereby commercial flights would be undertaken from an offshore launch platform. The basic Zenit booster received several upgrades to the propulsion and avionics systems for Sea Launch as well as a third stage, and the first test with a dummy payload was carried out on March 27, 1999. In October, a Direct TV 1-R satellite was orbited successfully. An ICO F-1 comsat was lost in March 2000 due to a second stage guidance malfunction. There followed eight consecutive successful launches until Apstar 5 in 2004 suffered a premature third stage shutdown that left it in an incorrect orbit, but the satellite&#x27;s onboard engines corrected it.

After nine successful launches, the Zenit produced a repeat performance of the 1990 disaster when on January 30, 2007, the first stage lost thrust and exploded. The flame deflector on the Sea Launch platform broke off and sank into the water. Loose debris had been sucked into a turbopump, resulting in engine failure.

By the late 2000s, the Zenit program at Baikonour was reviving and would see considerable success.

On February 1, 2013, an Intelsat satellite launched from the Sea Launch Odyssey platform in the equatorial Pacific. The nighttime launch performed nominally for about 20 seconds when the first stage abruptly lost thrust. Approximately 40 seconds after liftoff, all telemetry data ceased. Subsequent investigation showed that the Zenit had begun deviating from its flight path when the pitch and roll maneuver started. The onboard computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent an automatic shutdown command to the first stage at T+23 seconds, and impact with the ocean occurred about one minute after liftoff. Ultimately, the failure was traced to a defective hydraulic pump that controlled gimbaling of the first stage engines. This resulted in the booster starting an uncontrolled rolling motion which caused the computer system to terminate all thrust. Although anomalous conditions began around T+11 seconds, the Zenit&#x27;s flight computer was &quot;locked&quot; to prevent engine shutdown until at least 20 seconds after liftoff so the booster would not come down on or near the launch complex. Impact occurred about two miles downrange, but attempts to recover booster debris were unsuccessful.

In February 2015, following a year of strained relations as a result of a Russian military intervention into Ukraine, Russia announced that it would discontinue its &quot;joint program with Ukraine to launch Dnepr rockets and [was] no longer interested in buying Ukrainian Zenit boosters, deepening problems for [Ukraine&#x27;s] space program and its struggling Yuzhmash factory.&quot;

Strained relations between Ukraine and Russia after 2014 have led to Russian Federal Space Agency intending to purchase no more of the Zenit first-stage boosters made by Yuzhmash (powered by Russian engines). However 2 Zenit rockets that have been delivered to Russia for Russian Federal Space Agency missions will still be used; another Zenit rocket for launching a Ukrainian satellite has been completed but without engines due to lack of funding for payments. The world market for Zenit launch vehicles has shriveled since Sea Launch suspended operations, and the future of Zenit is uncertain.

Despite the ongoing conflict between the two governments, a Zenit rocket was launched in December 2017, after a two-year hiatus, to deliver AngoSat 1.

==Production==
The first and the second stages of the Zenit were designed by Yuzhnoye and are manufactured by Yuzhmash.

==Variants==

===Zenit-2===

The Zenit-2 was the first member of the rocket family. It consists of two stages. The first uses an RD-171 engine, and an RD-120 engine powers the second stage. It first flew on 13 April 1985, carrying a Tselina-2 mass simulator. However the test flight was unsuccessful. The first successful flight occurred on 22 October 1985.

===Energia booster===

The Zenit first stage was used as a strap-on booster rocket for the Energia carrier rocket. Four Zenit first stages were attached to the core vehicle to produce extra thrust at lift-off, in the same way that Solid Rocket Boosters were used on the US Space Shuttle. Energia made two flights (1987 and 1988) before the programme was abandoned.

===Zenit 2M and 2SLB===

Zenit 2M is a new version of the Zenit 2 with an upgraded control system and modernized engines. The first Zenit 2M was launched on June 29, 2007, carrying a classified Russian military Tselina-2 satellite. The Zenit-2SLB designation applies to commercial launches through the Land Launch subsidiary of Sea Launch, which began satellite launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome in 2008.

===Zenit-3SL===

Zenit-3SL is a three-stage carrier rocket developed for and used by the Sea Launch consortium.

It combines:
* two-stage Zenit-2S built by Ukraine&#x27;s SDO Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash
* Block DM-SL upper stage, provided by Russia&#x27;s Energia
* nose-cone enclosure for protection of payload during launch, provided by Boeing.

Rockets used by Sea Launch are assembled in Long Beach, California. Launches occur from the &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; offshore launch platform, situated at the equator. &quot;Ocean Odyssey&quot; is also used to transport rockets to the launch site. The most recent launch of a Zenit-3SL occurred on 11 December 2015. The RD-171 engine of the Zenit-3SL first stage, and most of the control system of -3SL missiles were made in Russia. However, according to the same source, it is not clear if Russia&#x27;s component suppliers are still working together with Yuzhmash as of this date.

===Zenit 3M and 3SLB===

The Zenit-3M is a Zenit-2M with the Block-DM upper stage used on the Zenit-3SL. It is launched from Baikonur. The maiden flight was launched on 28 April 2008. Land Launch commercially market the Zenit-3M under the designation Zenit 3SLB.

===Zenit-3F===

The Zenit-3F, also known as the Zenit-2SB/Fregat, is a 3-stage derivative of the Zenit-2M, using a Fregat upper stage, as already used on the Soyuz, to propel spacecraft to higher orbits. It made its maiden flight in January 2011, with the Elektro-L No.1 spacecraft for the Russian government. Later the same year, another launch carried Spektr-R, a space telescope, into an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of . The most recent launch occurred on 26 December 2017 from Baikonur Cosmodrome when the rocket lifted off with the Angolian Angosat 1 spacecraft.

<text>Nell&#x27;s (or Nells) was a nightclub located on 244 West 14th Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. It opened in the fall of 1986 in the space of a former electronics store and closed May 30, 2004.

==History==
Nell&#x27;s opened in the fall of 1986 in the space of a former electronics store. It came onto the scene when some clubgoers were tiring of the cavernous discothèques (e.g., Studio 54) popular in the 1970s and early 1980s. Decorated as a slightly shabby 19th-century English men&#x27;s club, Nell&#x27;s afforded its upscale patrons a place to eat, sit, socialize, and listen to live music. Other exclusive supper clubs like M.K. and Au Bar soon followed.

Actress-singer Nell Campbell was its namesake and longtime proprietress. Initially, she co-owned the club with Lynn Wagenknecht and Keith McNally. McNally gave up ownership when he and Wagenknecht divorced. The painter Thomas Moller was Nell&#x27;s original manager. Moller takes credit for attracting New York&#x27;s art scene to the club. Also a 1985 Interview Magazine included Nell and Christian Lepanto in different articles. Christian L worked as coatcheck and introduced Semour Stein to Tommy Page. At its peak of popularity in the late 1980s, with a capacity of only 250, Nell&#x27;s was known for denying even the famous entry to the club.

It was the quiet hookup place for Rob Lowe and Melissa Gilbert. Prince also visited as well as Al Franken. It was the last nightclub Andy Warhol attended with Dionne Warwick just before his botched hospital visit in which he died. On June 4, 1987, artist Robert Mapplethorpe and actress Susan Sarandon hosted a dinner for AIDS charity amfAR at Nell&#x27;s. Duran Duran frontman Simon Le Bon and his wife Yasmin Le Bon frequented the night club in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.

In the 1990s Nell&#x27;s matured into a jazz, reggae, and hip-hop showcase.

Run-DMC was often known to take over the DJ booth on any given night. In 1995, The Notorious B.I.G. made his video for &quot;Big Poppa&quot; there. It was also there in 1993 that Tupac met a woman who accused him of sexual assault

Nell&#x27;s was also a frequent haunt of fictional character Patrick Bateman, in the book &quot;American Psycho&quot; by Bret Easton Ellis.

In early 2004, actor Mark Wahlberg was planning to buy Nell&#x27;s. It closed on May 30, 2004.

The space later held a private club NA opened by actor Chris Noth and his business partner Noel Ashman. Noel Ashman then teamed up with new partners to open semi-private club NA in 2005. Several other clubs opened and closed in the space before the space split into two to become Stash nightclub, which lies underneath Snap Sports Bar.

<text>The dram (alternative British spelling drachm; apothecary symbol [[Ezh|ʒ]] or ℨ; abbreviated dr) is a unit of mass in the avoirdupois system, and both a unit of mass and a unit of volume in the apothecaries&#x27; system. It was originally both a coin and a weight in ancient Greece. The unit of volume is more correctly called a fluid dram, fluid drachm, fluidram or fluidrachm (abbreviated fl dr, ƒ 3, or fʒ).

==Ancient unit of mass==

*The Attic Greek drachma () was a weight of 6 obols, Greek mina, or about 4.37 grams.
* The Roman drachma was a weight of Roman pounds, or about 3.41 grams.
A coin weighing one drachma is known as a stater, drachm, or drachma. The Ottoman dirhem () was based on the Sassanian drachm, which was itself based on the Roman dram/drachm.

==British unit of mass==
The British Weights and Measures Act 1878 introduced verification and consequent stamping of apothecary weights, making them officially recognized units of measurement. By 1900, Britain had enforced the distinction between the avoirdupois and apothecaries&#x27; versions by making the spelling different:
*&quot;dram&quot; now meant only avoirdupois drams, which were of an avoirdupois ounce. An ounce consisted of 437.5 grains, thus making the dram exactly 27.34375 grains.
*&quot;drachm&quot; now meant only apothecaries&#x27; drachms, which were of an apothecaries&#x27; ounce of 480 grains, or equal to 60 grains.

==Modern unit of mass==
In the avoirdupois system, the dram is the mass of  pound or  ounce. The dram weighs  grains, or exactly grams.

In the apothecaries&#x27; system, which was widely used in the United States until the middle of the 20th century, the dram is the mass of  pounds apothecaries (lb ap), or  ounces apothecaries (oz ap or ℥) (the pound apothecaries and ounce apothecaries are equal to the troy pound (lb t), and troy ounce (oz t), respectively). The dram apothecaries is equal to or , or exactly grams.

&quot;Dram&quot; is also used as a measure of the powder charge in a shotgun shell, representing the equivalent of black powder in drams avoirdupois.

==Unit of volume==
The &quot;fluid dram&quot; (or &quot;fluid drachm&quot; in British spelling) is defined as of a fluid ounce, and is exactly equal to:
* in the U.S. customary system
* in the British Imperial system

A teaspoonful has been considered equal to one fluid dram for medical prescriptions. However, by 1876 the teaspoon had grown considerably larger than it was previously, measuring 80–85 minims. As there are 60 minims in a fluid dram, using this equivalent for the dosage of medicine was no longer suitable. Today&#x27;s US teaspoon is equivalent to exactly 4.92892159375 ml, which is also US fluid ounces, US fluid drams, or 80 US minims.

While pharmaceuticals are measured nowadays exclusively in metric units, fluid drams are still used to measure the capacity of pill containers.

&quot;Dram&quot; is used informally to mean a small amount of liquor, especially Scotch whisky. The unit is referenced by the phrase &quot;dram shop&quot;, the U.S. legal term for an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages.

==In popular culture==
The line &quot;Where&#x27;d you get your whiskey, where&#x27;d you get your dram?&quot; appears in some versions of the traditional pre–Civil War American song &quot;Cindy&quot;. In the Monty Python&#x27;s song &quot;The Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song&quot;, there is the line &quot;Hobbes was fond of his dram&quot;. In the old-time music tradition of the United States, there is a tune entitled &quot;Gie the Fiddler a Dram&quot;, &quot;gie&quot; being the Scots language word for &quot;give&quot;, brought over by immigrants and commonly used by their descendants in Appalachia at the time of writing. &quot;Little Maggie,&quot; a traditional song popular in bluegrass music, refers to the title character as having a &quot;dram glass in her hand.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Double Indecency&quot; of the TV series &quot;Archer&quot;, the character Cheryl/Carol was carrying around 10 drams of Vole&#x27;s blood and even offered to pay for a taxi ride with it.

In Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, the Fremen employ a sophisticated measurement system that involves the drachm (and fractions thereof) to accurately count and economize water, an ultra-precious resource on their home, the desert planet Arrakis.

In the video game Caves of Qud water is used as the primary currency, being measured by the Dram.

<text>The Armenian dram (; sign: [[֏]]; abbreviation: դր.; ISO code: AMD) is the currency of Armenia. It was historically subdivided into 100 luma (). The Central Bank of Armenia is responsible for issuance and circulation of dram banknotes and coins, as well as implementing the monetary policy of Armenia.

The word &quot;dram&quot; means &quot;money&quot; and is cognate with the Greek drachma and the Arabic dirham, as well as the English weight unit dram.

== History ==

The first instance of a &quot;dram&quot; currency was in the period from 1199 to 1375, when silver coins called &quot;dram&quot; or &quot;tram&quot; were issued. Dram or Takvorin coinage would periodically continue to be produced for some time until the loss of Armenia&#x27;s independence. The establishment of Russian Armenia saw the adoption of the Imperial ruble, followed by a series of attempts to localize the Russian ruble under the Soviet Union and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On 21 September 1991, a national referendum proclaimed Armenia as a republic independent from the Soviet Union. The Central Bank of Armenia, established on 27 March 1993, was given the exclusive right of issuing the national currency.

In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the Russian rouble) among CIS states. Armenia joined this rouble zone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a currency union in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The Rouble Zone effectively collapsed with the unilateral 1993 Russian monetary reform process. As a result, the remaining CIS participants – Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia – were &#x27;pushed out&#x27; and forced to introduce separate currencies. Armenia was one of the last countries to do so when it introduced the dram on 22 November 1993.

=== Armenian dram sign ===

As the result of common business practice and the unique pattern of Armenian letters, the shape of the sign and its variations appeared in the business scratches (daybooks). Until the official endorsement of the sign a number of artists and businessmen developed and offered various shapes for it. Now the dram symbol is included in the Armenian standard for the national characters and symbols and in the Armenian computer fonts. The current standard sign for the Armenian dram (֏, image: ; ; code: AMD) was designed in 1995. In Unicode, it is encoded at .

==Coins==
In 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5, and 10 drams. 
In 2003 and 2004, a second series consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram coins was introduced to replace the first series.

The Central Bank has also issued a great number of commemorative coins intended for sale to collectors. A listing can be found at the authorized central bank distributors.

===First series (1994–2002)===
In 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5, and 10 drams. The other coins are officially in circulation but rarely used because of their low nominal value.
* All coins bear the year of the first issue (1994).

=== Second series (2003–present) ===

On 22 November 1993, banknotes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 drams were issued. 
Notes for ֏1,000 and ֏5,000 were put into circulation later.

=== Second series (1998–2017) ===
Banknotes of ֏50, ֏100, and ֏500 are rarely seen in circulation. Coins of ֏50, ֏100, and ֏500 are used instead.
A commemorative ֏50,000 note was issued on 4 June 2001 in commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in Armenia.

===500 dram commemorative note (2017)===
A 500 dram commemorative note was issued on 22 November 2017 to commemorate both the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark and the 25th anniversary of Armenia&#x27;s national currency. 
=== Third series (2018–present) ===
A third series of Armenian dram banknotes was issued in 2018, All denominations for this series are the same as its previous issues, with the 2,000 dram banknote as a newly introduced denomination, the 50,000 dram banknote re-issued for this series and the omission of the 50, 100, 500, and 100,000 dram banknotes for this issue. The new series are printed on hybrid substrates of Louisenthal.

The first three denominations, ֏10,000, ֏20,000 and ֏50,000, were issued on November 22, 2018 to mark 25 years of Armenian currency. The final three denominations, ֏1,000, ֏2,000 and ֏5,000 were issued on December 25, 2018.

<doc id="700640" wikidata="Q245928" url="?curid=700640" title="Raven (DC Comics)">
<text>Raven is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in a special insert in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October 1980), and was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez.

Raven, daughter of the powerful demon Trigon and human Arella, possesses a supernatural lineage that grants her remarkable abilities as an empath. She can sense emotions and manipulate her soul-self, which takes the form of her namesake, for various purposes. Despite her lineage and the ominous predictions associated with her connection to Trigon, Raven becomes a prominent member of different Teen Titans and Titans lineups, where recognized for her expertise in mysticism and stands out as one of the team&#x27;s most formidable members. The character has also served as a member of other teams in the DC Universe, including the Justice League, Sentinels of Magic, and the Justice League Dark.
Raven has appeared in numerous television series and films, including as one of the Teen Titans in Cartoon Network&#x27;s eponymous series and its spin-off series &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, voiced by Tara Strong, and in the DC Animated Movie Universe (DCAMU), voiced by Taissa Farmiga. The character made her live-action debut in the DC Universe/HBO Max series &quot;Titans&quot;, portrayed by Teagan Croft.

==Development==
In an interview, Perez described his design approach for the character, &quot;taking the cue that Raven was very mysterious à la Phantom Stranger, I took that as a starting point, and using the shadow face where half her face is always in shadow despite the lighting, was a shtick I got from Phantom Stranger, who also had the same deal. He had a long billowing cape, as did she, and in her case, since her name was Raven, I decided to create a silhouette for her that would look like a bird. The hood was designed so that in the profile, it would end up looking like a birds head, so that when her soul self came out, since that was done in full black, it looked like a gigantic black Raven. Her name and the Phantom Stranger were key to how I designed her.&quot;

Perez was asked if the characters face was based on any real life person, Perez stated the following, &quot;originally Raven was Persis Khambatta, the actress who played in the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and later became a young lady named Fran Macgregor, who was a dancer, and I used some of her features, particularly for her figure, for Raven.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===First life of Raven===
Raven first appeared in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #1 recruiting superheroes to fight her father Trigon. She initially approached the Justice League for help, but they refused her on the advice of Zatanna, who sensed her demonic parentage. In desperation, she reformed the Teen Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father. The team consisted of Robin, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, Starfire, Cyborg, and Beast Boy (then known as Changeling). Raven and her new friends later came to think of one another as family.

Trigon soon took Raven to his home dimension. The Titans defeated Trigon and sealed him in an interdimensional prison with the help of Arella, who stayed at the interdimensional door as Trigon&#x27;s Guardian. Raven continued to fight her father&#x27;s influence, and her face started changing. For a period of time, Raven lost control several times in stressful situations but managed to regain control before Trigon could assert himself.

Eventually, Trigon escaped his prison, destroyed Azarath, came to Earth, and took control of Raven. The Titans were manipulated into having the dark sides of their souls kill the evil Raven by Lilith, who was guided and possessed by Azar, thereby allowing the souls of Azarath and Raven herself contained inside her rings to possess her now-empty body and use her as a channel to kill Trigon. After this battle, Raven rose from the ashes, cleansed of Trigon&#x27;s evil, and vanished.

===Raven===
After Raven&#x27;s disappearance, Arella went around the world in search of Raven. She tracked Raven down, but both of them were kidnapped by Brother Blood. The minions of Brother Blood used Raven to control Nightwing (formerly Robin) as part of Blood&#x27;s plans. The Titans rescued them both and prevented Brother Blood from returning to power.

As a result of the defeat of Trigon, Raven was free to experience emotions for the first time in her life. Raven found she could not only sense but control others&#x27; emotions. She learned to handle this power only after unintentionally making The Flash believe that he loved her when she thought she was in love with him. Raven also fostered a relationship with technopath Eric Forrester, who used the life force of women he seduced to regain some of his lost humanity. Forrester knew that Raven&#x27;s soul-self could help him to retain his humanity permanently. This attempt was cut short by the intervention of Joseph Wilson (Jericho), who helped Raven destroy Forrester once and for all and gain a romance between the two heroes after.
Raven was later kidnapped by the Wildebeest Society during the &quot;Titans Hunt&quot; storyline. The Wildbeest, led by the Trigon-possessed souls of Azarath, were going to use several Titans to bring about the return of Trigon. During a massive battle, Raven was possessed by the evil souls and once again became the evil doppelgänger of her father. Arella, along with Danny Chase, used the power of Azar&#x27;s soul to cleanse Raven. In the aftermath, Raven&#x27;s body was destroyed, and Arella and Danny sacrificed themselves and joined the cleansed souls of Azarath to become Phantasm.

===Evil Raven===
Raven appeared possessed by her evil conscience and attempted to implant Trigon&#x27;s seed into new bodies. She interrupted Nightwing and Starfire&#x27;s wedding and implanted a seed of Trigon into Starfire. Instead of corrupting her, she implanted the soul of the good Raven. This caused Starfire to leave Earth to escape from the evil Raven. The Titans could defeat Raven only because of the help they received from Phantasm.

Raven later returned, still evil, to destroy the good version of herself implanted in Starfire. With the help of the Titans, evil Raven was reduced to ashes, and the good part of Raven was given a new, golden spirit body completely free of her father&#x27;s demonic influence. In New Tamaran, Starfire and the golden spirit form of Raven revealed that implanting Raven&#x27;s soul in Starfire was actually a plan concocted by Raven to expunge her demonic soul, leaving her human half intact.

===Spirit===
In her bodiless spirit form, Raven returned to Earth to help extract her former teammate Cyborg&#x27;s soul and consciousness from the Technis planet&#x27;s computer mind. Later, she was instrumental in defeating Imperiex by aiding Wonder Woman and Tempest in re-powering Darkseid. Once Imperiex was defeated, Raven then resumed her journey to find a new purpose.

===Rebirth===
Raven&#x27;s spirit was eventually ensnared by Brother Blood and his Church of Blood; they used sorcery to bind her soul to the body of a teenage girl. The Teen Titans (reformed again), discovered that the Church of Blood were worshipers of Raven&#x27;s father, Trigon. They also found a prophecy about the marriage between Brother Blood and Raven that would result in Armageddon. The new team interrupted the wedding, and Brother Blood and his followers were forced to flee. Rejoining the Titans, Raven assumed the human identity of &quot;Rachel Roth&quot; by taking her late mother&#x27;s surname. As Rachel, she enrolled in a local high school.

After enduring much confusion about her new place in the world, Raven&#x27;s teammate Garfield Logan (Beast Boy), began developing romantic feelings for her, and the two became romantically attached.

===&quot;52&quot;===
In &quot;52&quot;, after the death of Superboy, the Titans began to fall apart. Robin joins Batman, and Wonder Girl left the team. Beast Boy struggled to maintain the team and was flippant towards Raven and their relationship. The new members who joined were only interested in seeking fame and honor rather than looking to fulfill justice. When Beast Boy decided to help Steel on a mission, most of the members left, leaving only Raven and Zatara. Later, Beast Boy, Raven, Offspring and Aquagirl aid Steel in launching an attack on LexCorp. Raven also participated in World War III. Eventually, Robin, Wonder Girl, and a few new members join the Titans, making the team whole again. Beast Boy and Raven were among the only members that remained in the team during this period.

====&quot;One Year Later&quot;====
Raven quit the team after she and Beast Boy ended their relationship. Letting the others think she was leaving because of Garfield, Raven left because she uncovered a secret of one of the other Titans.

Raven took advantage of this power with a book of unclear significance. Raven had a diskette containing Jericho&#x27;s soul. She performed a cleansing ritual over his soul and transferred it into a new body before returning to the team as a full member.

Without warning, the Titans are captured by the villainous Titans East and transported to the original Titan Island in New York City, where Raven is placed in the &quot;care&quot; of Enigma and Duela Dent, who took to torturing her psychologically. Raven manages her escape. After beating the Titans East, she and Garfield talk about their feelings, but he refuses to dwell on the matter, leaving their relationship uncertain.

Following the death of Bart Allen, Raven, along with the other adult Titans, decides to leave the team. Raven decides to pursue her chance at attending high school, having never had the opportunity before.

Raven stars in a five-issue miniseries written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Damion Scott. It occurs during the missing year, following Raven&#x27;s attempts at living as an ordinary teenage girl and attending high school. Unfortunately, she gets inadvertently drawn into a mystical fight involving Psycho-Pirate&#x27;s Medusa Mask and has to battle for the lives of her classmates. In the &quot;Wizard&quot; #177 magazine, Wolfman briefly described the series, saying, &quot;She needs to be on her own and in charge of herself for the first time in her life. This is more than just a &#x27;tale of Raven&#x27;; it sets up her new life&quot;.

===Titans===
Raven discovers that Trigon had more than one child, her half-siblings, and that a trio of children devoted to her father are behind the attacks. She is affected along with many of the other Titans by these three beings. Raven&#x27;s three half-brothers use her and Beast Boy as keys to open a portal to Trigon&#x27;s realm. Raven uses her own power to influence greed in others to make her half-brothers steal what little power Trigon had left. The portal is closed and Trigon&#x27;s sons, believing they have gained great power, leave.

Raven&#x27;s half-brothers later return and provoke her demonic side, causing her to leave the Titans and join them. However, the team was able to track them down and convince Raven to join the side of good once more. She later provided a number of other artifacts, all capable of killing her, to the Titans as terms for her staying with the team.

===Wyld===
Battered and dazed, Raven arrived at Titans Tower, where she was rescued by the newest roster of Teen Titans. While she was recovering, Beast Boy stated that he was still in love with her and would remain so, despite whatever difficulties were involved.

Raven decided to stay with the Teen Titans, now acting as a mentor to the younger members. When the Teen Titans attempted to return home, Raven was kidnapped and taken to another dimension by Wyld. Wyld reveals that Raven was the one who created him. When Raven was traveling dimensions looking for her father, her soul self caused all of the animals she visited to merge into one being: the Wyld. The Titans enter the Wyld World to rescue Raven. Wyld is eventually destroyed by Static.

In the final issue of this incarnation of the Titans, Superboy-Prime and his Legion of Doom attack Titan&#x27;s Tower. Raven stops Kid Flash just before he can kill Inertia. Then she reveals her soul-self to Headcase, terrifying and in so defeating him. After the Legion of Doom is defeated and Superboy-Prime is bound to the Source Wall, Beast Boy and Raven have a talk about her difficulty in reading Solstice&#x27;s emotions after Beast Boy had accused Raven of leaving her behind and he refused to believe her when she stated it wasn&#x27;t on purpose. They also talked of their encounter with Headcase. Eventually, Raven starts to open up about her true feelings. Beast Boy makes it clear he doesn&#x27;t want to escape from any part of her. Touched, Raven decides that she needs to embrace the positive feelings inside her rather than just her negative ones. Beast Boy assures her this is part of being human, and points out, &quot;I think you&#x27;ve worried enough about the bad...so why don&#x27;t we focus on the good for a change?&quot; With that, the two reconcile and share a heartfelt kiss. 

===The New 52===

After the events of the 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; series, the history of the DC Universe was altered, resulting in The New 52. Raven makes her New 52 debut in the first issue of the Phantom Stranger. There she is shown as a girl in a black and white striped sweater becoming distraught at a funeral over the overwhelming emotion emanating from the people there. The Phantom Stranger takes Raven to Stonehenge, the portal between Earth and the realm of Trigon. Being told by a &quot;higher power&quot; what must be done, the reluctant Stranger unwillingly hands her over to Trigon.

==== Teen Titans ====
Raven made her first &quot;Teen Titans&quot; appearance in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 4 #16. Raven, sporting a new costume, is introduced by Trigon as his &quot;Black Bird of Terror&quot; to his minions. It is strongly suggested that Raven had been controlling Robin&#x27;s emotions. During Trigon&#x27;s invasion on Earth, she approached a near dead Beast Boy who had been assaulted by Deathstroke earlier in the remains of the Ravagers facility. After being touched by Raven, Beast Boy awoke. When he asked if Harvest had sent her, she apologized stating that she brought him into the fray much sooner than she expected, stating, &quot;Hush. We are birds of a feather now... You are mine to control&quot;, as Raven mind-controlled him and teleported them to New York where Trigon and the Teen Titans are in battle.

==== Raven&#x27;s origins revisited ====
Trigon reveals more of Raven&#x27;s origins. He has had a son from each of the other worlds he&#x27;s conquered, but Raven is his only daughter. Trigon let Raven&#x27;s mother, Arella, live as he believed that she needed to be raised as a human to preserve her natural empathetic abilities, key to Trigon&#x27;s plan to have his daughter succeed him as ruler of the seven under-realms. Refusing to accept this fate, Arella fled with her daughter to Azarath where the monks taught her how to control her dark side and avoid Trigon&#x27;s influence on her. Years later, she escaped from Azarath to protect her mentors and planet from Trigon and fled to the Earth where Phantom Stranger captured her for Trigon.

Raven then returned to the under-realms and quickly surpassed her father&#x27;s expectations, recognizing that the only way to spare those she loved from his wrath was to accept the destiny he&#x27;d chosen for her. Impressed, Trigon abdicated his throne and gave it to Raven, who willingly took her birthright as Queen. 

==== Return of Trigon ====
In New York, Trigon&#x27;s three sons, Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge, assault the Teen Titans to take Raven back. Raven, Beast Boy, and the Titans defeat them, but Trigon appears again and takes control of the Titans save for Red Robin, Raven and Beast Boy. The manipulated Titans attack, and while Raven and Beast Boy distract them and Trigon, Tim cuts through Trigon&#x27;s eyes with his inertrite wings. Pulling out the wings from his eyes, Trigon compliments Tim before suddenly disappearing. Soon after, a woman and a group of suited men come through a portal, informing them that they will take Psimon into custody and make the incident appear as if it had never happened. When questioned about the police officers Psimon has killed, the woman reveals it was a hallucination by Trigon, so it has never happened.

Raven and Beast Boy are re-accepted into the Teen Titans. Raven brings controversy to the team by revealing Tim&#x27;s flirtatious relationships when under Trigon&#x27;s control. Raven goes into her room, leaving the awkward situation behind. There, she summons her father, saying, &quot;Father, I am one of them. Your plan worked perfectly&quot;, leaving questions on what side she is playing for.

Meanwhile, Tim calls Raven aside, telling that if something happens to him, the team will look up to her to lead them.

==== &quot;Forever Evil&quot; ====
After the events of &quot;Trinity War&quot;, the Earth&#x27;s greatest heroes are gone and the Crime Syndicate of America has taken over the world. The Teen Titans challenge the Crime Syndicate, but are easily overpowered by Johnny Quick and Atomica and then flung into the time stream. While the Titans are constantly flung through time, Raven is sent a few thousand years back in time. There, she is challenged by Etrigan the Demon, who recognizes her as Trigon&#x27;s daughter and tries to kill her. Raven is saved by Wonder Girl, who suggests that the way to stop Raven&#x27;s powers, since she was born and raised in a world between worlds, is to manipulate the energy within the time stream. Raven succeeds in anchoring the Titans with her soul-self, teleporting them through time.

The Titans arrive 20 years into the future, where Jon Lane Kent, has massacred most of Earth&#x27;s superheroes, leaving only a few, including Beast Boy (Garfield Logan), now calling himself Beast Man, and Rose Wilson. Superboy Kon-El and Jon battle, and Kon triumphs. But Kon is sent elsewhere by an unknown power, and a severely injured Jon is swapped unknowingly as Superboy by Logan and Wilson. The Titans depart again to an alien planet in the 30th century, where Kid Flash is a rebel leader and war criminal, Bar Torr. While the Titans stay to witness the Trial of Kid Flash, Raven deduces Superboy is Jon, and helps send him back to the present time so that he can find a cure for his deteriorating body condition.

Leaving Kid Flash and Solstice in the future, the Titans return to their original time and are united with Bunker, Beast Boy, and Skitter. Raven finds out that their journey has severed Trigon&#x27;s control over her. Followed by an attack by the villain Grimm, the Titans plan a final attack on Harvest&#x27;s new colony. Raven is reluctant to join because of her past actions, but Bunker tells her that everybody deserves a second chance, and Raven changes her mind. In the colony, they are surprised to find that everyone is returned to normal, and even the victims of the Culling have been restored to life. Raven plays a crucial role by finding out Harvest&#x27;s scheme to extract all the metagenes to create a massive DNA strand for his usage. This is destroyed by Raven&#x27;s soul-self and Harvest is finally defeated.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
Sometime after leaving the Teen Titans, Raven traveled to San Francisco hoping to find her mother&#x27;s family and introduce herself to them. She attempted to conceal her powers before having a misadventure and was then later abducted by Damian Wayne, who recruited her to be part of the new Teen Titans team he was establishing to take down his grandfather Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. It is then revealed that the Demon&#x27;s Fist, a team initially led by Damian before he decided to follow Batman, were hunting each of the assembled Titans that Damian had abducted for their initiation into the League of Assassins. Raven turns out to be the target of the assassin named Plague, whose hands can rot, decay and take the life out of anything she touches.

===New Justice===
===Infinite Frontier===
===Dawn of DC===
== Characterization ==
Within the DC Universe, Raven is a character who possesses considerable power as a result of her lineage and connection to Trigon, her demon father, who is often depicted as a powerful demonic entity. Her unique heritage, being half-demon and half-human with a human mother, leads to an ongoing theme of balancing her formidable powers and mastering the mystic arts. Despite the constant threat from her father and other demonic forces, the character aspires to become a hero and works to overcome the challenges presented by her lineage.

In the Infinite Frontier era, the character&#x27;s age is depicted in her twenties, in contrast to her portrayal as a teenager in DC Rebirth. During this time, she assumes the role of a faculty member at the Teen Titans Academy while also being a member of the Titans. As a faculty member, she takes on the responsibilities of a school counselor and serves as an expert in mystic subjects. Several other notable DC Comics characters whom are mystically inclined served under her tutelage, including fellow demon hybrid Nevermore, Shazam, and Stitch.

==Powers and abilities==
Under the tutelage of the being known as Azar, Raven became a skilled empath who can sense pain, disease, and remove them from a person&#x27;s body by assimilating them into her body and expunging them, a process depicted as painful. Other abilities as an empath includes reading emotions and possessing telepathic-like insights into the minds of others. Ultimately, these powers facilitate her &quot;Soul Self&quot;, an astral body shaped like her namesake. This soul-self has the capability to travel long distances, become intangible, and establish telepathic communication. It functions as a protective shield, capable of absorbing a limited amount of energy and solid matter, which can be regurgitated before reintegration with Raven. By converting her physical body into her soul-self, she can transport herself and others over a restricted distance, or teleport them. Additionally, her soul-self can mentally subdue individuals by enveloping them. Initially, Raven&#x27;s soul-self had a time limit of five minutes outside her body, after which she would experience mental torment. She eventually overcame this constraint.

Raven possesses a profound mastery of the mystic arts, which is intertwined with her soul-self. Her sorcerous abilities grant her a diverse range of powers including teleportation, manipulation of shadows, telekinesis, hypnosis and proficiency in chaos magic. Chaos magic is a form of sorcery within the DC Universe that enables practitioners to perform magical feats without adhering to specific systems such as incantations or chants. Over time, Raven&#x27;s mastery of these abilities has advanced to the extent that she is considered a skilled teacher in the mystic arts.

Like her brothers, Raven can induce and amplify one of the seven deadly sins (in her case, pride) or all seven of them, in any living being. Doing so causes her to suffer bouts of nausea and vomiting for several days afterward as side effects. Raven also has limited precognition allowing her to predict near-future events. This occurs involuntarily and infrequently.

Additionally, she has displayed excellent hand-to-hand combat, albeit rarely.

=== Weaknesses ===
As an empath, Raven is unable to completely disconnect herself from other&#x27;s emotions; exposure to many people with heightened emotions can pose a risk to her. Raven is also susceptible to overwhelming mystical forces.

==Collected editions==

Raven: Daughter of Darkness
==Other versions ==

=== The Unkindness ===
The Unkindness is a potential future incarnation of Raven, introduced in &quot;Future State: Teen Titans #1 (2021)&quot;. This iteration of the character, created by Tim Sherdian and Rafa Sandoval, follows a storyline that diverges from the main continuity after the events of Infinite Frontier. During a confrontation with the adversary Red X and the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, who were unleashed by the villain, Raven defeats them by using her magical powers to imprison their spirits within herself. However, this act of absorption corrupts her, leading Shazam to confine her within the Rock of Eternity to contain her corruptive power.

Corrupted, Raven forms an alliance with Neron, manipulating the separation of Billy Batson from his super-powered form, Shazam. Billy acts as a magical ward, while Shazam assumes the role of dealing with external threats and becomes the leader of the Justice League of America. In the absence of Billy&#x27;s influence, Shazam&#x27;s morality becomes corrupted, displaying a willingness to kill criminals and other heroes and facing challenges from others who question his true identity as Billy. As Shazam&#x27;s crimes are discovered by other heroes, the Spectre intervenes to gather more information about the situation. While aware of Shazam&#x27;s killings, the Spectre refrains from direct intervention due to Shazam&#x27;s past heroism. However, Shazam unexpectedly kills the Spectre using the remaining fragment of the Spear of Destiny. Subsequently, Deadman, who had been inhabiting the body of the fourth Question and one of Shazam&#x27;s victims, appears and briefly suppresses Shazam&#x27;s powers by using the magic word. This action serves the Unkindness and Neron&#x27;s interests, as the Living Lightning returns to the Rock of Eternity and is absorbed by the Unkindness, freeing her from confinement. Now in possession of the Powers of Shazam and considering herself unstoppable, the Unkindness becomes a significant threat to the universe. In return for his loyalty, she rewards her accomplice, Neron, with the Rock of Eternity.

=== Doctor Hate ===
Doctor Hate, also known as Dark Raven, is an evil version of Raven who debuted in &quot;Knight Terrors: Night&#x27;s End #1 (&quot;August, 2023&quot;),&quot; created by Joshua Williamson and Howard Porter. The character is depicted as the demonic half of Raven who gained independence.

With the help of Amanda Waller, Dark Raven becomes the direct counterpart of Doctor Fate by donning the Helmet of Hate, making her a powerful ally for the Lords of Chaos and Waller. The helmet was formed from a corrupted shard of the Helmet of Fate during the company-wide crossover event, &quot;Lazarus Planet.&quot; She is further augmented by the Nightmare Stone, introduced in the subsequent crossover storyline &quot;Knight Terrors&quot; as the opposite of the Dreamstone. In the conclusion of the &quot;Knight Terrors&quot; storyline, Hate assists Amanda Waller in shifting public opinion against the Justice League and entrusts the demonic half with the artifacts.

Doctor Hate first appears as a major villain in the &quot;&quot; crossover event, where she is responsible for erasing Beast Boy&#x27;s consciousness when he transformed into a Starro to defeat its ancestral enemy, the Necrostar. With the loss of humanity, Beast Boy adopts their behavior and infects others on the planet to transform them into animal-human hybrid creatures. Hate battles both heroes and villains of African origin known as &quot;The Network&quot; as well as the Titans, where her identity is eventually discovered by Nightwing and Raven. With the help of other Titans, Dark Raven is stripped of the Helmet of Hate but secretly prevailed in her fight with Raven, instead trapping her and covertly adopting her counterpart&#x27;s identity.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

Raul Arias Philippi of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated, &quot;In-universe acknowledgment of her powers and character growth in the Teen Titans is far more important than the portrayal doing Raven’s character justice, though, and Titans United #1 delivers on this front as well. First, Nightwing defers to Raven’s expertise when first encountering the recently empowered criminal. As Raven tries to assess and control the situation, she cycles through several of her powers to both engage the threat, and help her teammates, particularly a fatally injured Beast Boy who she heals without breaking a sweat. While previously her Teen Titans teammates might have been concerned about Raven overdoing it with the magic, it’s clear here that she has the team’s complete trust, regardless of whatever magic she uses and how complex or dangerous it is. Perhaps though, the biggest endorsement of Raven comes from Beast Boy, who lauds her heroism when returning to base, saying: “You always wanna help. That’s why you’re the best of us.”

<text>Kane Warren Hodder (born April 8, 1955) is an American actor, stuntman, and author.

Hodder is best known for his portrayal of Jason Voorhees in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise, with four appearances in the film series: &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot; (in which he also played Freddy Krueger&#x27;s clawed glove hand), and &quot;Jason X&quot;; and one in the video game &quot;Friday the 13th: The Game&quot;. He is also known for his role as Victor Crowley in the &quot;Hatchet&quot; series. He also played Leatherface during the stunts of &quot;&quot; and the motion capture in the video game &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;.

==Early life==
Hodder was born in Auburn, California in 1955.

==Career==
Early in his career during an interview, Hodder offered to show the interviewer and her cameraman a fire stunt. It went horribly wrong, leaving him with 2nd and 3rd degree burns over much of his upper body. It was because of these burns that he was initially selected to portray Freddy Krueger in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, a role that would eventually go to Robert Englund with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. Hodder was the first actor to portray Jason Voorhees more than once, in a total of four consecutive movies from &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot; to &quot;Jason X&quot;. He portrayed horror icon Leatherface through the stunt work of the 1990 film &quot;&quot; and played Freddy Krueger&#x27;s clawed glove hand at the ending scene of &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot;. He also acted as a police guard in &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; to promote &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, in costume as Jason.

Although he offered to reprise his role as Jason Voorhees in the 2003 film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, director Ronny Yu replaced Hodder with Canadian stuntman Ken Kirzinger. The switch created controversy among fans of the series and has been credited to several rumors, including Kirzinger&#x27;s location in Canada and his height compared to Robert Englund, the actor who portrayed Freddy Krueger, while Yu himself stated that it was New Line Cinema&#x27;s idea to do so. Though Hodder still expresses resentment over not being chosen, he is still good friends with Kirzinger and Englund. In 2011 Hodder wrote, along with author Michael Aloisi, his autobiography &quot;Unmasked: The True Story of the World&#x27;s Most Prolific Cinematic Killer&quot;. This was in 2014 turned into a webseries, which was released as &quot;The Killer &amp; I&quot;.

Hodder starred in the slasher film &quot;Hatchet&quot; as main character Victor Crowley, a physically deformed young boy who comes back from the dead to kill the people who invade the swamp where he lives— a similar story in relation to that of Jason Voorhees. The role earned him the Horror Jury Award for Best Actor at the Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. He reprised this role in &quot;Hatchet II&quot;, &quot;Hatchet III&quot; and &quot;Victor Crowley&quot;.

Hodder portrayed Grawesome Crutal in the slasher film, &quot;Muck&quot; and its sequel &quot;Muck: Feast of Saint Patrick&quot;. He co-starred with Doug Jones and Michael McShane in the horror comedy film &quot;Love in the Time of Monsters&quot;. In March 2015, he was part of Adam Green&#x27;s ArieScope webseries &quot;Adam Green&#x27;s Scary Sleepover&quot;.

Kane Hodder reprised his role as Jason Voorhees in &quot;Friday the 13th: The Game&quot;.

==Personal life==

Hodder is an avid poker player. He has the word &quot;Kill!&quot; tattooed on the back of his bottom lip. He spends time working with children in burn centers, and despite the roles he often plays, Hodder has often been described as a very friendly man who loves to meet his fans.

For a long time, Hodder claimed his favorite kill scene in his films was the &quot;sleeping bag against a tree&quot; scene from &quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot;. He now considers the one where he rips a woman&#x27;s face in half from &quot;Hatchet&quot; (2006) to be his favorite.

Hodder is a noted Juggalo, a fan of the group Insane Clown Posse. To reflect this, he has a custom charm of the group&#x27;s &quot;hatchetman&quot; logo holding a machete instead of a hatchet, a reference to his role as Jason.

Hodder appeared on the December 4, 2012 episode of the TruTV show &quot;Hardcore Pawn&quot;, in which he had a miniature gold mask made from a piece a fan had made for him.

Hodder is also an avid ghost hunter. He founded the Hollywood Ghost Hunters group with former stuntman and friend Rick &quot;Stuntman&quot; McCullum, who was a stunt double for Sid Haig.

In 1984, he married his wife Susan B. Hodder. They have two sons, Jace and Reed.

== &quot;Unmasked&quot; ==
Hodder co-wrote an autobiography with author Mike Aloisi. The book is about his life and experience in the film industry and was released on October 1, 2011.
&quot;Unmasked&quot; documents the unlikely true story of a boy who was taunted and beaten relentlessly by bullies throughout his childhood. Kane only escaped his tormentors when he moved to a tiny island in the South Pacific where he lived for all of his teen years. After living shirtless in a jungle for a while, he headed back to America where he fell in love with doing stunts—only to have his love burn him, literally. For the first time ever, Kane tells the true story of the burn injury that nearly killed him at the start of his career. The entire story of his recovery, the emotional and physical damage it caused, his fight to break back into the industry that almost killed him, and his rise to become a film actor are told in Kane&#x27;s own voice.

<text>Amin Saleh Majaj (, ; 21 March 1921, Ramallah – 2 January 1999, East Jerusalem) was a titular mayor of Jerusalem, formerly the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem that were occupied and annexed by Jordan during the years 1949–1967, and later occupied and annexed by Israel in the Six-Day War. 

Al-Majaj held the position from 1994 to his death after Mayor Ruhi al-Khatib died on 5 July 1994. A year later Jordanian businessman Zaki Al-Ghul was selected as successor to this position, which does not entail direct responsibility for municipal services. The position is not recognized by Israel.

Amin Majaj was a physician and a public servant. In the late 1940s and 1950s he made detailed research into malnutrition and its attendant diseases among children in the Palestinian refugee camps, and devised treatments for them.

Born in Ramallah in 1921 to a well known Christian family that belonged to the Anglican Episcopal Church, Majaj was educated at St George&#x27;s High School in Jerusalem (part of the Anglican bishopric), going on to the American University of Beirut in 1945 and to the University of London, where he studied medicine, specialising in child health.
Back in Jordan, Majaj was confronted by a new and challenging situation. There were now half a million refugees from Palestine in Jordanian camps, kept alive by UNRWA rations. Many children were dying from gastroenteritis and deficiency diseases.

Majaj realised that malnutrition among mothers was making breastfeeding ineffective and that lack of animal protein in the rations was the cause of iron-deficiency anemia, and protein deficiency resulting in diseases such as kwashiorkor. The remedy, a diet rich in animal proteins and vitamin B12 injections, was easier to recommend than to implement.

His research continued until the children&#x27;s wards in the Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem, where Majaj worked as head of the paediatrics department from 1950 to 1991, sustained a direct hit when the Israelis invaded the West Bank during the 1967 war.

Majaj published the results of his research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1966, in the Gazette of the Egyptian Paediatric Association of 1960 and in British and German medical journals. He was paediatrician at the Makased Islamic Hospital in Jerusalem from 1967 to 1982 (director from 1977), as well as on the board of hospitals in Gaza and Nablus.

He was on the Jerusalem municipal council from 1950 and at the time of his death was acting mayor of East Jerusalem. He also served as a member of the Jordanian parliament from 1967 to 1988, and as Minister of Health in 1957 and in 1964. Among his many other responsibilities he took over direction of Musa Alami&#x27;s Arab Development Society in Jericho, which took boys out of Palestinian refugee camps to teach them agricultural and other skills.

In 1947 he married Betty Dagher from Lebanon, who was the director of the Princess Basma Centre for Disabled Children in Jerusalem.

Amin Majaj, physician: born Ramallah, Palestine 21 March 1921; married 1947 Betty Dagher (one son, three daughters); died Jerusalem 2 January 1999.

<doc id="700663" wikidata="Q2210354" url="?curid=700663" title="Hawkgirl">
<text>Hawkgirl is the name of several superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original Hawkgirl, [[Shiera Sanders Hall]], was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940). [[Shayera Hol]] was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert, and first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34 (March 1961). [[Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders)|Kendra Saunders]] was created by writer David S. Goyer and artist Stephen Sadowski, and first appeared in &quot;JSA: Secret Files and Origins&quot; #1 (August 1999). One of DC&#x27;s earliest super-heroines, Hawkgirl has appeared in many of the company&#x27;s flagship team-up titles including Justice Society of America and Justice League of America.

Several incarnations of Hawkgirl have appeared in DC Comics, most of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special Nth metal that allows flight. Some incarnations have real wings (DCAU &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;). Most incarnations of Hawkgirl work closely with a partner/romantic interest Hawkman.

Since DC&#x27;s continuity was rewritten in the 1985 series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Hawkgirl&#x27;s history has become muddled with several new versions of the character appearing throughout the years, some associated with ancient Egypt and some with the fictional planet Thanagar. These versions of the character have starred in several series of various durations.

Shiera Sanders Hall, Shayera Hol, and Kendra Saunders have all been adapted into various media, including direct-to-video animated films, video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. In particular, Ciara Renée portrayed Saunders in the Arrowverse franchise while Isabela Merced will portray her in the DC Universe (DCU) film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025).

==Publication history==
===Golden Age===
Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, Shiera Sanders first appeared in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced Hawkman. Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by Sheldon Moldoff, based on Neville&#x27;s Hawkman costume.

===Silver Age===

With the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of &quot;Flash Comics&quot; in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the Flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl became married Thanagarian police officers from the planet Thanagar who come to Earth to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as Shayera Hol (phonetically identical to Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the Justice League in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her name to Hawkwoman in the Hawkman backup feature of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #274.

With the establishment of DC&#x27;s multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One.

===Post-Crisis and One Year Later===
Following the events of DC&#x27;s miniseries, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the &quot;Last Days of the Justice Society&quot; one-shot. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, Limbo, where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent Ragnarök from occurring on the Earth.

Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. However, DC reversed this decision and rebooted Hawkman continuity after the success of the &quot;Hawkworld&quot; miniseries. Originally, &quot;Hawkworld&quot; was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but after the series became a success, DC Comics made &quot;Hawkworld&quot; an ongoing series set in the present, with both heroes only recently appearing on Earth after the events in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; miniseries, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. Several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkgirl&#x27;s Justice League appearances then needed to be fixed, including their appearance in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; miniseries. All previous appearances by the Silver Age Hawkgirl in the Justice League were explained by the Golden Age Hawkgirl taking the Silver Age Hawkgirl&#x27;s place. However, Hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre-&quot;Hawkworld&quot; Justice League adventures during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was trapped in Limbo. To explain this continuity error, a new Hawkwoman, Sharon Parker, was created and retconned into the Justice League during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was in Limbo.

After the Hawkworld reboot, Hawkgirl (Hawkwoman) was now Shayera Thal and not married to Katar Hol, instead merely his police partner. In post-Hawkworld continuity, Shayera adopts the name Hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name Hawkgirl. The Golden Age Hawkgirl is eventually returned from Limbo, but during the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; miniseries she is merged with Katar Hol and Golden Age Hawkman into a new persona.

A new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl&#x27;s cousin, Speed Saunders. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly &quot;JSA&quot; series and later in the &quot;Hawkman&quot; monthly. In 2006, the ongoing &quot;Hawkman&quot; monthly series was retitled &quot;Hawkgirl&quot; starting with issue #50 as part of the &quot;One Year Later&quot; jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The &quot;Hawkgirl&quot; comic book series was finished with issue #66.

==Fictional character biographies ==
===Shiera Sanders Hall===
The Golden Age Hawkgirl was Shiera Sanders Hall, the reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman.

===Shayera Hol===
===Kendra Saunders===
Kendra Saunders was a young Hispanic woman who took her own life. When Kendra&#x27;s soul left her body, that of her grandfather&#x27;s first cousin Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl entered it, making Kendra a walk-in. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer Speed Saunders, recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the &quot;new&quot; Hawkgirl.

==Powers and abilities==
Hawkgirl owes her powers to a belt of Nth metal, a substance native to the planet Thanagar (once home of another pair of Hawk-heroes, Katar Hol and Hawkwoman). The metal is psycho-reactive, responding to its bearer&#x27;s thoughts and in its base form has a number of electromagnetic/gravitational properties. To the Hawks, it grants the power of flight, superhuman strength, super-acute vision, and an enhanced healing/regeneration ability.

Additionally, she displays advanced hand-to-hand combat skills. Like Hawkman, she retains the knowledge of several lifetimes worth of fighting. Her preferred weapons are a spear or mace, but she has also been depicted using swords, axes, warhammers, shields, and other melee weapons. She possesses shooting skills from her times as the gunfighter, Cinnamon.

In addition, the Nth metal knife which murdered Hawkgirl in her original incarnation as Chay-Ara had an unusual effect upon her soul and that of her lover Khufu (Hawkman). The pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries. While not a superhuman power per se, this propensity for reincarnation has allowed Hawkgirl to cheat death and return to active duty in her current incarnation.

Like all modern Thanagarians, Shayera Hol has a pair of wings growing from her back which allows her to fly. As a Thanagarian, she has considerable physical strength, endurance and durability.
As a former member of the Thanagarian military, she had extensive training in tactics, military science, and personal combat skills. Additionally, her focus in espionage can make her a difficult opponent to track, and provides her with an advantage when tracking villains.

Hawkgirl carries a mace made of Nth metal, which can generate electric currents and repel magical energies, her mace is highly effective against magic, as shown when Hawkgirl defeated Doctor Fate, a powerful magician of the DC Universe. Hawkgirl is skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately. She has creatively used the mace as a shield to deflect incoming projectiles as well as a makeshift defibrillator unit.

Hawkgirl is fluent in many Earth languages, through the use of the Absorbascon. Her unique Thanagarian physiology also enables her to verbally communicate with birds.

The Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.

Recently, Kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing, strength, vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing Nth metal. She speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance. It remains to be seen if she still possesses these abilities now that she is Shiera Hall once again.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event, Hawkgirl joined with the Amazons&#x27; Furies. Later, Hawkgirl is seen aiding Artemis in her attempt to kill the Resistance movement member, Lois Lane. Although Lois is rescued by Resistance member Penny Black using the smoke grenades, Penny is seriously wounded. Later, when the Furies attack Grifter and the Resistance, Hawkgirl pins Grifter down, but he pulls Hawkgirl down and then stabs her chest with a trench knife.

===&quot;DC Bombshells&quot;===
In the &quot;DC Bombshells&quot; continuity set in World War II, Shiera is a technological genius and archaeologist who aids the Bombshells with her lover, Vixen. As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when Cheetah forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace.

Shiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.

Intrigued, Shiera went to Zambesi to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met Queen Mari of Zambesi and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies.

Hawkgirl discovered her true Thanagarian origins while fighting against Baroness Paula von Gunther. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it was revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the Wingmen of Thanagar, they sought to warn the humans of the intentions of Thanagar who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.

=== Elseworlds ===
Shayera and Katar are featured in the Elseworlds three-part series &quot;Legend of the Hawkman&quot; (2000). The story takes place in the Earth-One timeline, some time after &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34. She is shown wanting to return home to Thanagar while Katar has grown accustomed to life on Earth. Although this mini-series was never labelled as an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; era.

===&quot;Legend of the Hawkman&quot;===
Hawkgirl (Shayera Hol) and Hawkman feature in this mini-series set soon after their arrival on Earth as the duo faces an ancient menace with connections to their Thanagarian heritage. In the first chapter, &quot;The Fallen One&quot;, Shayera has been anxious to return to Thanagar, but Katar feels a responsibility to the museum, especially its upcoming extraterrestrial treasure exhibit. While Katar has adopted Earth as his home Shayera doesn&#x27;t feel like they belong there. In Tibet a group of archaeologists discovers a Thanagarian gateway carved into a cliff side, after being informed of this Hawkgirl and Hawkman travel to the location.

Hawkman deciphers the writing on the gateway and it depicts the life of Thasaro, a Thanagarian child so evil that he threatened the existence of Thanagar&#x27;s ancient gods. The ancient gods of Aerie condemned Thasaro into a mystic urn. Shayera&#x27;s ancestor was entrusted with burying the urn so no one could release Thasaro. The archeologists and Katar want to examine the gateway but Shayera insists that the gateway be left alone. Hawkman and Shayera get into a fight until Shayera flies away heartbroken because Katar cares more about archeology than her feelings. Katar&#x27;s fingerprints genetically open the gateway. Shayera hears an explosion and heads back to the site. Thasaro appears and makes the stone sentries throughout his chamber come to life. The sentries attack Hawkgirl but she manages to defeat his enforcers and finds Katar within Thasaro&#x27;s grip. Thasaro then summons corpses like talons that rise up from the ground and pull Hawkgirl into a cavern beneath Thasaro&#x27;s chamber. The talons maim Hawkgirl, but she manages to break away. Shayera&#x27;s distress in the cavern awakens the spirit of her ancestor. Shayera&#x27;s ancestor channels his aura into Shayera and gives her the edge she needs to subdue Thasaro. Thasaro is banished once again into the urn. The urn is then transported to the Midway City Museum so Katar and Shayera can safeguard it. Three months later Shayera is shown wanting to start a family, in the meantime Thanagarian zealots return to Earth to free the heinous fallen god. Thasaro&#x27;s return brings chaos and devastation to Midway City, but using their Nth Metal weapons Hawkgirl and Hawkman are able to subdue him, banishing him to the fiery depths of Earth&#x27;s Hell.

===&quot;JLA: The Nail&quot; &amp; &quot;JLA: Another Nail&quot;===
In &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, Hawkgirl is a member of a Justice League, and remains so even after her husband&#x27;s death by Amazo, although the team faces anti-alien prejudice and suspicion. She briefly contemplates abandoning Earth when anti-alien propaganda leads to a museum exhibit dedicated to Hawkman being vandalized, but when she returns to save two children from a burning building, her faith in humanity is restored when a group of civilians stand between her and government officials attempting to bring her in as an alien, the family she saved affirming that they still see Hawkman and her as heroes. In &quot;Another Nail&quot;, she appears to be close friends with Zatanna. She has forgiven Oliver Queen (in Amazo&#x27;s body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed, Queen believing that his attempts to prove himself caused Hawkman to put himself in danger to protect the more vulnerable Oliver. Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series.

===&quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again&quot;===
In &quot;&quot;, the Hawks tried to return to Thanagar to flee from Lex Luthor&#x27;s military dictatorship, only to crash in the rain forests of Costa Rica. They decided to remain in hiding. They gave birth to a son and daughter, giving them natural wings. Katar and Shayera were killed in a military strike ordered by Lex Luthor, embracing each other in their final moments. The children were brought up in the jungle ever since. They were bent on revenge against Lex. As Hawkboy, the son ultimately kills Lex with Batman&#x27;s permission, since he understands what he has been through.

===&quot;Justice&quot;===
In Alex Ross&#x27;s Silver Age-toned &quot;Justice&quot;, Hawkgirl is a member of the Justice League and co-director of the Midway City Museum, alongside her husband. With the entire JLA&#x27;s secrets and weaknesses in hand, the Legion of Doom stages a simultaneous attack on nearly every member of the League. Hawkgirl and Hawkman are surprised by Toyman in the Midway City Museum, but manage to survive and decide to investigate his warehouse, where they are assaulted by his forces, and discover that he is making multiple Brainiac androids. She also appears in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; and &quot;Liberty and Justice&quot;.

===&quot;Gotham City Garage&quot;===
Kendra Saunders&#x27;s version of Hawkgirl is featured in &quot;Gotham City Garage&quot; series. She is the youngest member of a very old team. It&#x27;s revealed that Kendra&#x27;s parents were killed during an alien invasion, she was later rescued by the Blackhawks and trained from a young age with captain Blackhawk. She is shown using the Lady Blackhawk costume and the alias Kendra Blackhawk. She resigns from the Blackhawks to help the Gotham City Garage against Lex Luthor&#x27;s attacks.

===&quot;DC New Talents Showcase&quot;===
Hawkgirl was chosen for one of the seven features in the one-shot comic book. She lives in Chicago, working as a police detective. She is from Thanagar, her mace vibrates like a smartphone when Nth-Metal Thanagarian weapons are near and she has a secret Hawkroom. It is revealed that she did not leave Thanagar on good terms. After some time collecting Thanagarian weapons from crime scenes, she started suspecting something was wrong. This led to her fighting against an ancient Thanagarian that wanted her dead since she chose humans instead of Thanagarians.

Erica Schultz, said she was inspired by the DC Animated Universe version of the character: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been drawn to strong characters, but what really solidified my love for Shayera was the &quot;Justice League&quot; cartoon show.&quot;

===&quot;Scooby-Doo Team-Up&quot; #17===
During a crossover with the cast of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, the Silver Age version of Hawkgirl is featured alongside Hawkman in the Midway City Museum, working as curators. The heroes team-up with the characters from the animated series to discover who stole from their workplace. Later they uncover that Shadow Thief, Matter Master and Fadeaway Man were behind it. After a fight against the villains the heroes retrieve the stolen items.

===&quot;Bombshells: United&quot;===
Hawkgirl appears as Shiera Hall in the continuation series to &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot;, &quot;Bombshells: United&quot; set in the United States in 1943. Shiera is shown in Green Light alongside her lover, Green Light. Hawkgirl is later featured fighting against the Apokolips invasion on Earth.

<text>The Iron Gates (; ; ; Hungarian: &quot;Vaskapu-szoros&quot;) is a gorge on the river Danube. It forms part of the boundary between Serbia (to the south) and Romania (north). In the broad sense it encompasses a route of ; in the narrow sense it only encompasses the last barrier on this route, just beyond the Romanian city of Orșova, that contains two hydroelectric dams, with two power stations, Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station and Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station.

At this point in the Danube, the river separates the southern Carpathian Mountains from the northwestern foothills of the Balkan Mountains. The Romanian side of the gorge constitutes the Iron Gates Natural Park, whereas the Serbian part constitutes the Đerdap National Park. A wider protected area on the Serbian side was declared the UNESCO global geopark in July 2020.

Archaeologists have named the Iron Gates mesolithic culture (dated circa 13,000 to 5,000 years ago) after the gorge. One of the most important archaeological sites in Serbia and Europe is Lepenski Vir, the oldest planned settlement in Europe, located on the banks of the Danube in the Iron Gate gorge.

== Toponymy ==

In English, the gorge is known as Iron Gates or Iron Gate. An 1853 article about the Danube in &quot;The Times&quot; of London referred to it as &quot;the Iron Gate, or the Gate of Trajan.&quot;

In languages of the region including Romanian, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, German, and Bulgarian, names literally meaning &quot;Iron Gates&quot; are used to name the entire range of gorges. These names are (), , , , , and &quot;Železni vrata&quot;. An alternative Romanian name for the last part of the route is &quot;Defileul Dunării&quot;, literally &quot;Danube Gorge&quot;.

In Serbian, the gorge is known as &quot;Đerdap&quot; (Ђердап; ), with the last part named &quot;Đerdapska klisura&quot; (Ђердапска клисура; , meaning Đerdap Gorge) from the Byzantine Greek &quot;Κλεισούρα (kleisoura)&quot;, standing for &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;pass.&quot;

Both Đerdap and the former Serbian name, Demir-kapija, are Turkish in origin. Demir-kapija means &quot;iron gate&quot; (&quot;demirkapı&quot;) and a translation of it entered most of the other languages as the name of the gorge, while &quot;đerdap&quot; comes from &quot;girdap&quot; which means whirlpool, vortex.

== Natural physical features ==
=== Gorges ===
The first narrowing of the Danube lies beyond the Romanian isle of Moldova Veche and is known as the &quot;Golubac gorge&quot;. It is 14.5 km long and wide at the narrowest point. At its head, there is a medieval fort at Golubac, on the Serbian bank. Through the valley of &quot;Ljupovska&quot; lies the second gorge, &quot;Gospodjin Vir&quot;, which is 15 km long and narrows to . The cliffs scale to 500 m and are the most difficult to reach here from land. The broader &quot;Donji Milanovac&quot; forms the connection with the &quot;Great&quot; and the &quot;Small Kazan gorge&quot;, which have a combined length of . The &quot;Orșova valley&quot; is the last broad section before the river reaches the plains of Wallachia at the last gorge, the &quot;Sip gorge&quot;.
The Great Kazan (&quot;kazan&quot; meaning &quot;cauldron&quot; or &quot;reservoir&quot;) is the most famous and the most narrow gorge of the whole route: the river here narrows to 150 m and reaches a depth of up to .

=== Navigation and channels ===
The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping, even for the most seasoned boatmen. During the period of the Ottoman rule, the ships were guided through by the local navigators, familiar with the routes, called &quot;kalauz&quot; (from Turkish &quot;kalavuz&quot;, meaning guide, travel leader). During the rule of prince Miloš Obrenović, local Serbs gradually took over from the Ottomans, being officially appointed by the prince. In order not to aggravate the Ottomans further, the prince named Serbian navigators by a Turkish name, &quot;dumendžibaša&quot;, from &quot;dümen&quot; (rudder) and &quot;baş&quot; (head, chief, master). The navigation fee was divided among &quot;dumendžibaša&quot;, &quot;loc&quot; (river pilots) and regional municipalities.

In German, the passage is still known as the &quot;Kataraktenstrecke&quot;, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual &quot;Iron Gates&quot; strait the &quot;Prigrada&quot; rock was the most important obstacle (until 1896): the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the &quot;Greben&quot; rock near the &quot;Kazan&quot; gorge was notorious.

Some of the channels created included:
* Stenka, long, with 10 navigational signals (originally, the balloons were used)
* Izlaz-Tahatlija, , with 7 signals
* Svinița, , with 4 signals
* Juc, , with 5 signals
* Sip, 
* Mali Đerdap, , as an extension of Sip Channel

In total, of navigable channels was created. They were flooded when the artificial Lake Đerdap was created (early 1970s). The results of these efforts were slightly disappointing. The currents in the Sip Channel were so strong at 15kts (8 m/s) that until 1973, ships had to be dragged upstream along the canal by locomotive. The Iron Gates thus remained an obstacle of note.

=== Dams ===

The construction of the joint Romanian-Yugoslavian mega project commenced in 1964. In 1972 the Iron Gate I Dam was opened, followed by Iron Gate II Dam, in 1984, along with two hydroelectric power stations, two sluices and navigation locks for shipping.

The construction of these dams gave the valley of the Danube below Belgrade the nature of a reservoir, and additionally caused a 35 m rise in the water level of the river near the dam. The old Orșova, the Danube island of Ada Kaleh (below) and at least five other villages, totaling a population of 17,000, had to make way. People were relocated and the settlements have been submerged.

When designed and built without adequate attention to the natural functioning of a river, dams have the effect of cutting a river into ecologically isolated compartments, which do not allow free movement and migration of species. Migratory fish are particularly badly hit, being rendered unable to move upstream or downstream between their spawning grounds and areas used at other times in their life cycle. The construction of the Iron Gates had a major impact on the local fauna and flora as well—for example, the spawning routes of several species of sturgeon were permanently interrupted. Beluga sturgeon was the largest, and the largest specimen was recorded in 1793, at . There have also been significant regional economic impacts – notably on the productivity of Danube fisheries. The status of the Danube&#x27;s migratory fish species is a strong indicator of the ecological health of the entire Danube River Basin, which in turn has wider economic and strategic consequences.

The flora and fauna, as well as the geomorphological, archaeological and cultural historical artifacts of the Iron Gates have been under the protection of both nations since the construction of the dam. In Serbia this was done with the Đerdap National Park (since 1974, ) and in Romania by the Porțile de Fier National Park (since 2001, ).

== History ==
=== Prehistoric and Roman era ===

Sandstone statues dated to the early Neolithic era indicate that the area has been inhabited for a very long time. Even more significant are the Iron Gates Mesolithic (c. 13,000 to 5,000 BP) sites – in particular, the gorge of &quot;Gospodjin Vir&quot;, which contains the major archaeological site of Lepenski Vir (unearthed in the 1960s). Lepenski Vir is often regarded as the most important Mesolithic site in south-east Europe. 

East of the Great Kazan the Roman emperor Trajan built the legendary bridge erected by Apollodorus of Damascus. Construction of the bridge ran from 103 through 105, preceding Trajan&#x27;s final conquest of Dacia. (On the right (Serbian) bank a Roman plaque commemorates him. On the Romanian bank, at the &quot;Small Kazan&quot;, a likeness of Decebalus, Trajan&#x27;s Dacian opponent, was carved in rock in 1994–2004.)

John Hunyadi and his 15,000 men defeated the 80,000-strong army of &quot;Beylerbey&quot; Şehabeddin at Zajkány (today&#x27;s Zeicani), near the Iron Gate of the Danube river in 1442.

=== Ada Kaleh ===

Perhaps the most evocative consequence of the Đerdap dam&#x27;s construction was the flooding of an islet named Ada Kaleh. A former Turkish exclave, it had a mosque and a thousand twisting alleys, and was known as a free port and smuggler&#x27;s nest. Many other ethnic groups lived there beside Turks.

The island was about downstream from Orșova and measured 1.7 by 0.4–0.5 km. It was walled; the Austrians built a fort there in 1669 to defend it from the Turks, and that fort would remain a bone of contention for the two empires. In 1699 the island came under Turkish control, from 1716 to 1718 it was Austrian, after a four-month siege in 1738 it was Turkish again, followed by the Austrians reconquering it in 1789, only to have to yield it to the Turks in the following peace treaty.

Thereafter, the island lost its military importance. The 1878 Congress of Berlin forced the Ottoman Empire to retreat far into the south, but the island remained the property of the Turkish sultan, allegedly because the treaty neglected to mention it. The inhabitants enjoyed exemption from taxes and customs and were not conscripted. In 1923, when the Ottoman monarchy had disappeared, the island was given to Romania in the Treaty of Lausanne.

The Ada Kaleh mosque dated from 1903 and was built on the site of an earlier Franciscan monastery. The mosque&#x27;s carpet, a gift from the Turkish sultan Abdülhamid II, has been located in the Constanța mosque since 1965.

Most Ada Kaleh inhabitants emigrated to Turkey after the evacuation of the island. A smaller part went to Northern Dobruja, another Romanian territory with a Turkish minority.

=== 19th century&#x27;s Hungarian initiatives ===

By the early 19th century, freedom of navigation on the Danube was regarded as important by many different states in the region and beyond. Allowing passage through the Iron Gates by larger vessels had become a priority. By 1831 a plan had been drafted to make the passage navigable, at the initiative of Hungarian politician István Széchenyi. Not being satisfied with the solutions compiled by the Austrio-Hungarian government and the Austro-Turkish commission, the government of Hungary formed its own commission for the organization of the navigation through the Iron Gates. The project was finished in 1883. Appointed in 1883 and again in 1886, Minister of Trade and Transportation Gábor Baross, Hungary&#x27;s &quot;Iron Minister&quot;, presided over modernization projects at Hungary&#x27;s sea port in Fiume (Rijeka), and regulation of the Upper Danube and Iron Gate. 

Works on the gorge section were done by the Hungarian Technical Administration over 11 years from 1889. The works were divided in two sectors, the upper and the lower Iron Gates. The channels in the upper section, at the town of Orșova (the tripoint between Austria-Hungary, Romania and Serbia at the time) were up to wide and deep, at the zero water level in Orșova. In the southern section, the channels were wide and deep, except for the Sip Channel, which was wide. In 1890, near Orșova, the last border town of Hungary, rocks were cleared by explosion over a stretch in order to create channels. A spur of the Greben Ridge was removed across a length of over . Here, a depth of sufficed. On 17 September 1896, the Sip Canal thus created (named after the Serbian Sip village on the right bank) was inaugurated by the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph, the Romanian king Carol I, and the Serbian king Alexander Obrenovich.

== Cultural references to the Iron Gates ==
=== Literature ===

* A plan to blow up the Iron Gates gorge and thereby block the Danube grain trade is included in the proposed acts of sabotage in the &quot;Balkan Trilogy&quot; section of the Fortunes of War novels (1960–1980) by Olivia Manning. A similar plot device, to prevent oil barges reaching Nazi Germany, is used by Dennis Wheatley in his 1946 Duke de Richleau novel, &quot;Codeword: Golden Fleece&quot;.
* Two novels – &quot;The Valley of Horses&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot; (1990) – in Jean M. Auel&#x27;s series &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; focus on the difficulties of prehistoric people traveling through or around the Iron Gates in both during scene sequences detailing travel adventures whilst the protagonists navigate between the upper and lower Danube valleys.
* The 1986 book &quot;Between the Woods and the Water&quot;, by travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, describes a night on the now submerged island Ada Kaleh and a trip by ferry through the Iron Gates, in August, 1934.
* The 2016 book &quot;Threads, The Fabric of Family Lives Pulled Apart By War&quot;, by D. W. Hoffman (2016) describes a daring escape attempt by Czech refugees hoping to reach Palestine in August of 1940 aboard a derelict paddlewheel steamer. They were detained at Donji by the Serbs and later the Bulgarians and Romanians, all of whom were afraid to allow the craft to pass, fearing it would sink in the Iron Gates and block critical wartime traffic.
* Mór Jókai&#x27;s 1872 novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Touch&quot; starts with a lengthy description of the gorge. Many of the main characters are introduced during a voyage through the Iron Gates on a merchant vessel towed up the river.

=== Film ===

* The 2003 film &quot;Donau, Duna, Dunaj, Dunav, Dunarea&quot; contains several minutes of film of the Iron Gates.

=== Music ===

* The Iron Gates are mentioned in the second verse of the Zvonko Bogdan song &quot;&quot;.
* The folk song &#x27; by Milutin Popović, commonly called &#x27;, includes a mention of the Iron Gates in the beginning.

<doc id="700674" wikidata="Q709372" url="?curid=700674" title="Tr (Unix)">
<text>tr is a command in Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems. It is an abbreviation of translate or transliterate, indicating its operation of replacing or removing specific characters in its input data set.

==Overview==
The utility reads a byte stream from its standard input and writes the result to the standard output. As arguments, it takes two sets of characters (generally of the same length), and replaces occurrences of the characters in the first set with the corresponding elements from the second set. For example,

 tr &#x27;abcd&#x27; &#x27;jkmn&#x27;

maps all characters &quot;a&quot; to &quot;j&quot;, &quot;b&quot; to &quot;k&quot;, &quot;c&quot; to &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; to &quot;n&quot;.

The character set may be abbreviated by using character ranges. The previous example could be written:

 tr &#x27;a-d&#x27; &#x27;jkmn&#x27;

In POSIX-compliant versions of codice_1, the set represented by a character range depends on the locale&#x27;s collating order, so it is safer to avoid character ranges in scripts that might be executed in a locale different from that in which they were written. Ranges can often be replaced with POSIX character sets such as &quot;[:alpha:]&quot;.

The &quot;codice_2&quot; flag causes codice_1 to compress sequences of identical adjacent characters in its output to a single token. For example,

 tr -s &#x27;\n&#x27;

replaces sequences of one or more newline characters with a single newline.

The &quot;codice_4&quot; flag causes codice_1 to delete all tokens of the specified set of characters from its input. In this case, only a single character set argument is used. The following command removes carriage return characters.

 tr -d &#x27;\r&#x27;

The &quot;codice_6&quot; flag indicates the complement of the first set of characters. The invocation

 tr -cd &#x27;[:alnum:]&#x27;

therefore removes all non-alphanumeric characters.

==Implementations==
The original version of codice_1 was written by Douglas McIlroy and was introduced in Version 4 Unix.

The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Jim Meyering. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. It is also available in the OS-9 shell. A codice_1 command is also part of ASCII&#x27;s &quot;MSX-DOS2 Tools&quot; for MSX-DOS version 2. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

Most versions of codice_1, including GNU codice_1 and classic Unix codice_1, operate on single-byte characters and are not Unicode compliant. An exception is the Heirloom Toolchest implementation, which provides basic Unicode support.

Ruby and Perl also have an internal &quot;tr&quot; operator, which operates analogously. Tcl&#x27;s &quot;string map&quot; command is more general in that it maps strings to strings while tr maps characters to characters.

<doc id="700676" wikidata="Q1751977" url="?curid=700676" title="Confessionalization">
<text>In Protestant Reformation history, confessionalization is the parallel processes of &quot;confession-building&quot; taking place in Europe between the Peace of Augsburg (1555) and the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). For most of this time, there was a nominal peace in the Holy Roman Empire between the Protestant and Catholic confessions as both competed to establish their faith more firmly with the population of their respective areas. This confession-building occurred through &quot;social-disciplining,&quot; as there was a stricter enforcement by the churches of their particular rules for all aspects of life in both Protestant and Catholic areas. This had the consequence of creating distinctive confessional identities that influenced church dogma, faith formation, liturgy, and the development of universities.

The German historian Ernst Walter Zeeden first described the phenomenon of &#x27;confession building&#x27; (&quot;Konfessionsbildung&quot;) in the 1950s. In the 1970s, Wolfgang Reinhard and Heinz Schilling further developed these ideas in parallel, applying their ideas to church-state formation in Roman Catholic and Lutheran contexts in the Holy Roman Empire.

Calvin&#x27;s Geneva is also a model case for the confessional era because of its high degree of social control, unity and homogeneity under one expression of a reformed Christian faith. The Genevan model was informed by an interpretation of Erasmus&#x27; humanism. The reformation had shown the independent character of northern Europe to resist acceptance to Catholic orthodoxy and thus called for an end to the Corpus Christianum. The new model sought to establish a decentralized Christian community, rooted in the belief that one&#x27;s own interpretative theology was correct and sufficient.

Confessionalization was supported by monarchs and rulers in general, because after the Reformation had brought control over their territories&#x27; churches into their hands, they could exercise more power over their subjects by enforcing strict religious obedience. The main tool for the enforcement of these rules were &quot;police-regulations&quot;. These were behavior codes for religious, social and economic life to which the common citizen had to oblige under threat of severe punishment.

Increasingly, the secular governments (sometimes in cooperation or conflict with the churches they controlled) provided material relief for the poor and needy, and in return the state demanded obedience and increased taxes from its subjects. Thus, confessionalization is often described as a developmental stage towards both the absolutist states of the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as the modern welfare state.

Nancy Shields Kollmann used the term &quot;confessionalization&quot; to refer to the religious arbitration and control used in the Russian Empire to manage the activity of non-Orthodox religions such as Catholicism, Lutheranism, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. Tsarist Russia, a multi-confessional empire with one state religion, banned the proselytization of other faiths to Orthodox Christians. However, the tsarist administration supported centralizing institutions within other religions (such as the Orenburg Assembly) insofar as they would aid in local administration and were allied with the state.

<doc id="700677" wikidata="Q10199" url="?curid=700677" title="Zaza language">
<text>Zaza (endonym: , , , or ) is a Northwestern Iranian language spoken primarily in eastern Turkey by the Zazas, who are mostly considered as Kurds, and in many cases identify as such. The language is a part of the Zaza–Gorani language group of the northwestern group of the Iranian branch. The glossonym Zaza originated as a pejorative. According to Ethnologue, Zaza is spoken by around 1.48 million people, and the language is considered threatened due to a declining number of speakers, with many shifting to Turkish. Nevins, however, puts the number of Zaza speakers between two and three million.

== Classification ==
The Zaza language is considered a branch of the Kurdic subgroup within the Northwestern Iranian languages. The varieties of Kurdic do not directly descend from any known Middle Iranian languages, such as Middle Persian or Parthian, or from Old Iranian languages, such as Avestan or Old Persian. Zaza is considered a macrolanguage, consisting of Southern and Northern Zaza. Glottolog database classifies Zazaki under the Adharic branch of Northwestern Iranian languages.

Linguistically, the classification of Zazaki as either a Kurdish dialect or a distinct language is a topic of debate among scholars. Some, such as Ludwig Paul, do not consider Zazaki and Gorani to be Kurdish dialects. According to him, they can only be classified as Kurdish dialects in a political and ethnic context, and it would be more accurate to refer to them as Kurdish languages. The differences between them arise from the Kurdish adoption of Persian linguistic features due to historical contact. Other scholars contend that the classification of Zazaki as a separate language from Kurdish is based on insufficient data, and a detailed comparison between Zazaki and Kurmanji in terms of phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon reveals a significant degree of shared features, suggesting that Zazaki and Kurmanji are dialects of the same language.

Furthermore, arguments regarding the classification of both Zazaki and Gorani highlight that the distinction between a dialect and a language is a social construct influenced by factors such as shared identity, history, beliefs, and living conditions, rather than being based solely on linguistic evidence. Therefore, Kurdish can be seen as a socio-cultural umbrella that encompasses both recognized Kurdish dialects (such as Kurmanji, Sorani, and Southern Kurdish) as well as the Zaza and Gorani languages. The term &quot;Kurdic&quot; is used to refer to this broad grouping.

German linguist Jost Gippert has demonstrated that the Zaza language is very closely related to the Parthian language in terms of phonetics, morphology, syntax and lexicon and that it has many words in common with the Parthian language. According to him, the Zaza language may be a residual dialect of the Parthian language that has survived to the present day.

== Endangerment ==
Many Zaza speakers resided in conflict-affected regions of eastern Turkey and have been significantly impacted by both the current and historical political situations. Only a few elderly monolingual Zaza speakers remain, while the younger generation predominantly speaks other languages. Turkish laws enacted from the mid-1920s until 1991 banned Kurdish language, including Zazaki, from being spoken in public, written down, or published. The Turkish state’s efforts to enforce the use of Turkish have led many Zaza speakers to leave Turkey and migrate to other countries, primarily Germany, Sweden, Netherlands and the United States, and Australia.

Efforts to preserve and revitalize Zazaki are ongoing. Many Kurdish writers in Turkey are fighting to save Zazaki with children’s books and others with newspapers, but the language faces an uncertain future.

The decline of Zazaki speakers could also lead the Zazas to lose their identity and shift to a Turkish identity. According to a study led by Dr. Nadire Güntaş Aldatmaz, an academic at Ankara University, 402 people aged between 15 and 75 from Mamekîye in Dersim province, were interviewed. Respondents younger than 18 mostly stated their ethnicity as ‘Turk,’ their mother language as ‘Turkish,’ and their religion as ‘Islam,’ despite having some proficiency in Zazaki.

== History ==
Writing in Zaza is a recent phenomenon. The first literary work in Zaza is &quot;Mewlîdu&#x27;n-Nebîyyî&#x27;l-Qureyşîyyî&quot; by Ehmedê Xasi in 1899, followed by the work &quot;Mawlûd&quot; by Osman Efendîyo Babij in 1903. As the Kurdish language was banned in Turkey during a large part of the Republican period, no text was published in Zaza until 1963. That year saw the publication of two short texts by the Kurdish newspaper &quot;Roja Newe,&quot; but the newspaper was banned and no further publication in Zaza took place until 1976, when periodicals published a few Zaza texts. Modern Zaza literature appeared for the first time in the journal &quot;Tîrêj&quot; in 1979 but the journal had to close as a result of the 1980 coup d&#x27;état. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most Zaza literature was published in Germany, France and especially Sweden until the ban on the Kurdish language was lifted in Turkey in 1991. This meant that newspapers and journals began publishing in Zaza again. The next book to be published in Zaza (after &quot;Mawlûd&quot; in 1903) was in 1977, and two more books were published in 1981 and 1986. From 1987 to 1990, five books were published in Zaza. The publication of books in Zaza increased after the ban on the Kurdish language was lifted and a total of 43 books were published from 1991 to 2000. As of 2018, at least 332 books have been published in Zaza.

Due to the above-mentioned obstacles, the standardization of Zaza could not have taken place and authors chose to write in their local or regional Zaza variety. In 1996, however, a group of Zaza-speaking authors gathered in Stockholm and established a common alphabet and orthographic rules which they published. Some authors nonetheless do not abide by these rules as they do not apply the orthographic rules in their oeuvres.

In 2009, Zaza was classified as a vulnerable language by UNESCO.

The institution of Higher Education of Turkey approved the opening of the Zaza Language and Literature Department in Munzur University in 2011 and began accepting students in 2012 for the department. In the following year, Bingöl University established the same department. TRT Kurdî also broadcast in the language. Some TV channels which broadcast in Zaza were closed after the 2016 coup d&#x27;état attempt.

==Dialects==
There are three main Zazaki dialects:
* Northern Zazaki is spoken mainly in Aşkale, Hozat, Hınıs, Kelkit, Nazimiye, Ovacık, Pülümür, Tekman, Tercan, Varto, and Yayladere.

* Central Zazaki is spoken mainly in Çemişgezek, Genç, Karakoçan, Karlıova, Mazgirt, Mutki, Pertek, and Solhan.

* Southern Zazaki is spoken mainly in Alacakaya, Arıcak, Çermik, Çüngüş, Dicle, Ergani, Eğil, Hani, Kovancılar, Kulp, Lice, and Palu.

Zazaki shows many similarities with other Northwestern Iranian languages:
* Similar personal pronouns and use of these
* Enclitic use of the letter &quot;u&quot;
* Very similar ergative structure
* Masculine and feminine ezafe system
* Both languages have nominative and oblique cases that differs by masculine -î and feminine -ê
* Both languages have forgotten possessive enclitics, while it exists in such other languages as Persian, Sorani, Gorani, Hewrami or Shabaki
* Both languages distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated voiceless stops
* Similar vowel phonemes

Ludwig Paul divides Zaza into three main dialects. In addition, there are transitions and edge accents that have a special position and cannot be fully included in any dialect group.

== Grammar ==
As with a number of other Iranian languages like Talysh, Tati, central Iranian languages and dialects like Semnani, Kahangi, Vafsi, Balochi and Kurmanji, Zaza features split ergativity in its morphology, demonstrating ergative marking in past and perfective contexts, and nominative-accusative alignment otherwise. Syntactically it is nominative-accusative.

=== Grammatical gender ===
Among all Western Iranian languages Zaza, Semnani, Sangsari, Tati, central Iranian dialects like Cālī, Fārzāndī, Delījanī, Jowšaqanī, Abyāne&#x27;i and Kurmanji distinguish between masculine and feminine grammatical gender. Each noun belongs to one of those two genders. In order to correctly decline any noun and any modifier or other type of word affecting that noun, one must identify whether the noun is feminine or masculine. Most nouns have inherent gender. However, some nominal roots have variable gender, i.e. they may function as either masculine or feminine nouns.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

The vowel may also be realized as when occurring before a consonant. may become lowered to when occurring before a velarized nasal , or occurring between a palatal approximant and a palato-alveolar fricative . Vowels , , or become nasalized when occurring before , as , , and , respectively.

=== Consonants ===

 becomes a velar when following a velar consonant.

=== Alphabet ===

Zaza texts written during the Ottoman era were written in Arabic letters. The works of this era had religious content. The first Zaza text, written by Sultan Efendi, in 1798, was written in Arabic letters in the Nesih font, which was also used in Ottoman Turkish. Following this work, the first Zaza language Mawlid, written by the Ottoman-Zaza cleric, writer and poet Ahmed el-Hassi in 1891-1892, was also written in Arabic letters and published in 1899. Another Mawlid in Zaza language, written by another Ottoman-Zaza cleric Osman Esad Efendi between 1903-1906, was also written in Arabic letters. After the Republic, Zazaki works began to be written in Latin letters, abandoning the Arabic alphabet. However, today Zazaki does not have a common alphabet used by all Zazas. An alphabet called the Jacabson alphabet was developed with the contributions of the American linguist C. M Jacobson and is used by the Zaza Language Institute in Frankfurt, which works on the standardization of Zaza language. Another alphabet used for the language is the Bedirxan alphabet. The Zaza alphabet, prepared by Zülfü Selcan and started to be used at Munzur University as of 2012, is another writing system developed for Zazaki, consisting of 32 letters, 8 of which are vowels and 24 of which are consonants. The Zaza alphabet is an extension of the Latin alphabet used for writing the Zaza language, consisting of 32 letters, six of which (ç, ğ, î, û, ş, and ê) have been modified from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language.

==Vocabulary==
== Literature ==
Zaza literature consists of oral and written texts produced in the Zaza language. Before it began to be written, it was passed on through oral literature types. In this respect, Zaza literature is very rich in terms of oral works. The language has many oral literary products such as deyr (folk song), kilam (song), dêse (hymn), şanıke (fable), hêkati (story), qesê werênan (proverbs and idioms). Written works began to appear during the Ottoman Empire, and the early works had a religious/doctrinal nature. After the Republic, long-term language and cultural bans caused the revival of Zaza literature, which developed in two centers, Turkey and Europe, mainly in Europe. After the loosened bans, Zaza literature developed in Turkey.

=== Ottoman period ===
The first known written works of Zaza literature were written during the Ottoman period. Written works in the Zaza language produced during the Ottoman period were written in Arabic letters and had a religious nature. The first written work in Zazaki during this period was written in the late 1700s. This first written text of the Zaza language was written by İsa Beg bin Ali, nicknamed Sultan Efendi, an Islamic history writer, in 1212 Hijri (1798). The work was written in Arabic letters and in the Naskh script, which is also used in Ottoman Turkish. The work consists of two parts III. It includes the Eastern Anatolia region during the reign of Selim III, the life of Ali (caliph), Alevi doctrine and history, the translation of some parts of Nahj al-balagha into Zaza language, apocalyptic subjects and poetic texts. About a hundred years after this work, another work in the Zaza language, Mevlit (Mewlid-i Nebi), was written by the Ottoman-Zaza cleric, writer and poet Ahmed el-Hassi (1867-1951) in 1891-1892. The first Mevlit work in the Zaza language was written in Arabic letters and published in 1899. The mawlid, written using the Arabic prosody (aruz), resembles the mawlid of Süleyman Çelebi and the introduction includes the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the details of Allah, tawhid, munacaat, ascension, birth, birth and creation, etc. It includes religious topics and consists of 14 chapters and 366 couplets. Another written work written during this period is another Mevlit written by Siverek mufti Osman Esad Efendi (1852-1929). The work called Biyişa Pexemberi (Birth of the Prophet) consists of chapters on the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the Islamic religion and was written in Zaza language in Arabic letters in 1901 (1903 according to some sources). The work was published in 1933, after the author&#x27;s death. Apart from Zaza writers, non-Zaza/Ottoman writers/researchers such as Peter Ivanovich Lerch (1827-1884), Robert Gordon Latham (1812-1888) Dr. Humphry Sandwith (1822-1881), Wilhelm Strecker (1830-1890), Otto Blau (1828-1879), Friedrich Müller (1864) and Oskar Mann (1867-1917) included Zaza content (story, fairy tales dictionary) in their works in the pre-Republican period.

=== Post-Republic Zaza literature ===
Post-Republican Zaza literature developed through two branches, Turkey-centered and Europe-centered. During this period, the development of Zaza literature stagnated in Turkey due to long-term language and cultural bans. Zaza migration to European countries in the 1980s and the relatively free environment enabled the revival of Zaza literature in Europe. One of the works in the Zaza language written in post-Republican Turkey are two verse works written in the field of belief and fiqh in the 1940s. Following this work, another Mevlit containing religious subjects and stories was written by Mehamed Eli Hun in 1971. Zaza Divan, a 300-page manuscript consisting of Zazaki poems and odes, started to be written by Mehmet Demirbaş in 1975 and completed in 2005, is another literary work in the divan genre written in this period. Mevlids and sirahs of Abdulkadir Arslan (1992-1995), Kamil Pueği (1999), Muhammed Muradan (1999-2000) and Cuma Özusan (2009) are other literary works with religious content. Written Zaza literature is rich in mawlid and religious works, and the first written works of the language are given in these genres. The development of Zaza literature through magazine publishing took place through magazines published by Zazas who immigrated to Europe after 1980 and published exclusively in the Zaza language, magazines that were predominantly in the Zaza language but published multilingually, and magazines that were not in the Zaza language but included works in the Zaza language. Kormışkan, Tija Sodıri, Vate are magazines published entirely in Zaza language. Apart from these, Ayre (1985-1987), Piya (1988-1992) and Raa Zazaistani (1991), which were published as language, culture, literature and history magazines by Ebubekir Pamukçu, the leading name of Zaza nationalism, are important magazines in this period that were predominantly Zaza and published multilingually. Ware, ZazaPress, Pir, Raştiye, Vengê Zazaistani, Zazaki, Zerq, Desmala Sure, Waxt, Çıme are other magazines that are Zazaki-based and multilingual. In addition to these magazines published in European countries, Vatı (1997-1998), which is the first magazine published entirely in Zaza language and published in Turkey, and Miraz (2006) and Veng u Vaj (2008) are other important magazines published in Zaza language in Turkey. Magazines that are mainly published in other languages but also include works in Zaza language are magazines published in Kurdish and Turkish languages. Roja Newé (1963), Riya Azadi (1976), Tirêj (1979) and War (1997) are in the Kurdish language; Ermin (1991), Ateş Hırsızı (1992), Ütopya, Işkın, Munzur (2000), Bezuvar (2009) are magazines in Turkish language that include texts in Zaza language. Today, works in different literary genres such as poetry, stories and novels in Zaza language are published by different publishing houses in Turkey and European countries.

<text>Meir Nitzan (; born 18 May 1931) is an Israeli politician. He was mayor of Rishon Lezion for five consecutive terms.

==Biography==
Meir Nitzan was born in Bucharest, Romania. He lived in a displaced persons&#x27; camp in Cyprus before making Aliyah at age 16. Upon his arrival in Israel, he lived in the then-transit camp Pardes Hanna. In the Israel Defense Forces, Nitzan served in the Ordnance Corps and reached the rank of colonel. He retired in 1979, but returned upon a promotion to brigadier general as the deputy head of the Technological and Logistics Directorate.

==Political career==
Nitzan became mayor of Rishon LeZion in 1983 and was re-elected four times. In November 2008, he lost the municipal elections to Dov Zur. After his defeat, Nitzan announced that he would run in the Kadima party primaries and vie for a seat in the Knesset in the 2009 elections. However, he later left the party to support Likud as he was unhappy with the behaviour of party leader Tzipi Livni. Kadima claimed Nitzan quit because the party refused to cover his campaign debts.
Nitzan served as acting mayor of Lod in 2011–2013. During his tenure, the crime rate dropped, the municipality organized a , a traditional Arab conciliatory meeting between two feuding families, and the budget was balanced.

<doc id="700699" wikidata="Q206918" url="?curid=700699" title="Moussaka">
<text>Moussaka (, , ) is an eggplant (aubergine)- or potato-based dish, often including ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many local and regional variations.

The modern Greek variant was created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes. Many versions have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg (custard) or flour (béchamel sauce). In Greece, the dish is layered and typically served hot. Tselementes also proposed a vegan variant for orthodox fast days. Romania also has a vegan version that replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.

The versions in Egypt, Turkey and the rest of the Middle East are quite different. In Egypt, &quot;messa&#x27;aa&quot; can be made vegan or vegetarian as well as with meat; in all cases, the main ingredient is the fried eggplant. In Turkey, &quot;mussaka&quot; consists of thinly sliced and fried eggplant served in a tomato-based meat sauce, warm or at room temperature. In Saudi Arabia, is eaten hot, but in other Arab countries, it is often eaten cold, but occasionally hot as well.

== Names and etymology ==
The English name for moussaka was borrowed from Greek () and from other Balkan languages, all borrowed from Ottoman Turkish, which in turn borrοwed it from Arabic (, ). The word is first attested in English in 1862, written &quot;mùzàkkà&quot;.

== Preparation ==
=== Greece ===

Most versions are based primarily on sautéed aubergine (eggplant) and tomato, usually with minced meat, mostly lamb. The Greek version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a béchamel (&quot;white&quot;) sauce and baked.

The modern Greek version was created by the French-trained Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s. His recipe has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined for the final baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant sautéed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or puréed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of béchamel sauce or savoury custard.

There are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no top sauce, sometimes with other vegetables. Such variants may include, in addition to the eggplant slices, sautéed zucchini (courgette) slices, part-fried potato slices, or sautéed mushrooms. There is a fast-day (vegan) version in Tselementes&#x27; cookbook, which includes neither meat nor dairy products, just vegetables (ground eggplant is used instead of ground meat), tomato sauce, and bread crumbs.

Another variant is &quot;&quot; () which consists of whole small eggplants stuffed with ground meat and topped with béchamel and baked.

=== Other countries of Southeast Europe ===

In Albania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and Romania, potatoes are used instead of eggplant, pork or beef mince, and the top layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes with a small amount of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and baked until the top is browned.

Typically, the Romanian version is made with potatoes or eggplant or cabbage. The layers start with the vegetable, then the layer of meat (usually pork), then vegetables, until the pot is full. Sometimes bread crumbs are used as a topping, sometimes slices of tomatoes and crushed cheese. The pot is then filled with tomato sauce. There is also a pasta variant, with pasta being used instead of vegetables. The &quot;fasting&quot; variant, which is vegan, replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.

In the rest of the Balkans, the top layer is often a custard: this is the version introduced to the UK by Elizabeth David&#x27;s &quot;Mediterranean Cookery&quot; and where it remains the usual presentation. Grated cheese or bread crumbs are often sprinkled on top.

=== Levant ===

In the Levant, moussaka is a cooked dish made up primarily of tomatoes and eggplant, similar to Sicilian caponata, and may also include chickpeas. It may be served cold as a mezze dish, or hot.

=== Egypt ===
The Egyptian version of moussaka is made from layers of fried eggplant immersed in tomato sauce and then baked. A layer of seasoned cooked ground beef is usually added between the eggplant before baking. The dish can be served hot but is usually chilled for a day or so to improve the taste.

=== Turkey ===

Turkish &#x27; is not layered. Instead, thinly sliced eggplant is fried and served in tomato-based meat sauce seasoned with green peppers, garlic and onions. It is generally eaten with &#x27; and . There are also variants with zucchini (courgettes, &#x27;), carrots (&#x27;) and potatoes (&quot;&quot;).

<text>The prime minister of Afghanistan, officially the prime minister of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is the head of government of Afghanistan.

The position was created in 1919 as an official appointed by the monarch of Afghanistan. The holder served mostly as an advisor, until the end of the Kingdom of Afghanistan in 1973. During the 1980s, the position was the head of government. The post was abolished after the US invasion that ousted the Taliban regime, after which a presidential form of government was established which lasted from 2004 to 2021. After the US withdrawal and the re-establishment of the Taliban rule, the post was revived.

The prime minister and government are subject to the instruction of the supreme leader. On September 7, 2021 the Taliban officials who exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control of Afghanistan announced Islamic scholar Hasan Akhund as acting prime minister in a new interim government of the recently re-established Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

==History==

===Emirate/Kingdom===

The chairman of the Council of Ministers was not the prime minister, but the monarch. Only during his absence was the prime minister the acting chairman of the Council.

Until 1963, King Mohammad Zahir Shah appointed his relatives as prime ministers. The king also had the power to dismiss or transfer the prime minister. From 1963 onwards, this was changed, stating that the head of the Afghan government was the prime minister, and that the government consisted of its ministers. It was the first time that the king did not play an important role in the government, leaving it to an elected authority. However, it also stated that they cannot engage in any other profession during their tenure of office.

The 1964 Constitution also granted the prime minister the power to summon the Electoral College in case of the death of the king. The prime minister only answered to the Wolesi Jirga (lower house of the Parliament) about the &quot;General Policy&quot; of the government, and individually for their prescribed duties.

===Democratic Republic===

In April 1978, Mohammad Daoud Khan was killed during a coup that started the &quot;Saur Revolution&quot;. The People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) revived the office of prime minister that year, and it remained throughout the 1980s.

The president was in charge of the appointment of the prime minister, who in turn appointed the Council of Ministers. The Council&#x27;s stated purpose was to formulate and implement domestic and foreign policies, to formulate economic development plans and state budgets, and to ensure public order.

Under the 1987 Constitution, the president was required to appoint the prime minister in order to form the government. The prime minister had the power to dissolve the government. Several Afghan presidents during the Democratic Republic era were also appointed as prime minister. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the prime minister was no longer in charge of the government. The general secretary of the PDPA or the director of the KHAD exercised greater power.

Also, the 1990 Constitution established that only Afghan-born citizens are eligible to hold the office, something that was not specified in the previous documents.

===Islamic State===

After the collapse of Mohammad Najibullah&#x27;s government, a transitional state was created. Thus, the office of prime minister once again played an important role in the history of the nation.

There was constant friction between the president and the premier during this period. The state had collapsed and there was not an effective central government from 1992 until 1996. Thus, the position became &quot;de facto&quot; ceremonial, with little power in what was left of the government.

===Islamic Emirate===

The title was abolished when the Taliban forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan took over control in 1996. The deputy leader of the Taliban was often known as the prime minister throughout its rule. With the death of Mohammad Rabbani in 2001, the Taliban decided not to revive the office.

Until September 1997, the government which the Taliban had ousted, which remained in rebellion until the end of the Taliban rule in 2001, had a prime minister in the government, but the position was abolished.

On September 7, 2021, the Taliban reinstated the position of prime minister with the formation of a new interim government.

The band finished recording their second studio album, titled &quot;Imago&quot;, in early 2006 and it was released on 17 June 2006. It debuted at No. 2 in the ARIA Chart for Weekly Top 100 highest-selling music albums. Their previous album, &quot;Begins Here&quot;, was released in the US through hard rock record label Megaforce Records. The band commenced the &quot;Imago&quot; tour around Australia in July.

In mid-2006, after nearly three years since its release &quot;Begins Here&quot; was certified gold in Australia, exceeding sales of 35,000 copies. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Imago&quot; also attained the same status, only this time it reached the gold mark in only eight weeks, including debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album charts.

Following the release of &quot;Imago&quot;, The Butterfly Effect spent the remainder of the year touring the record including an appearance on the 2007 Big Day Out festival tour. Shortly after, work began on material for the follow-up album. In July 2007, the band undertook the &quot;In a Memory&quot; Tour, with Chicago&#x27;s Chevelle and upcoming Brisbane act Dead Letter Circus. On this tour, they previewed &#x27;7 Days&#x27; and &#x27;Rain&#x27;. In early 2008, the &quot;Home Alone Tour&quot; was announced to fill in time before the recording of the new record. The tour, previewed additional new songs called &quot;The Hidden&quot; and &quot;In These Hands&quot;.

===2008–2009: &quot;Final Conversation of Kings&quot; ===
Recording of the album began in March 2008. The album, &quot;Final Conversation of Kings&quot;, was released in Australia on 20 September. The cover and booklet art was illustrated by Monaux. It debuted on the ARIA Charts at No. 3. On 14 July the band&#x27;s first single &quot;Window and the Watcher&quot; was debuted on radio station Triple J, with the single being released on 23 August. After the release of the album, The Butterfly Effect set off on a tour of Australia spanning October and November, with support from Melbourne acts Trial Kennedy and Sleep Parade. They also performed as part of the Big Day Out 2009 festival, headlining the Converse Essential stage.

===2010–2016: Aborted fourth album and breakup ===
Initial plans after wrapping up touring in support of &quot;Final Conversation of Kings&quot; involved writing and demoing material for a fourth album in 2010 and releasing it in early 2011. The band would also tour during this time, performing the &quot;Four Wheels and a Heartbeat&quot; tour in 2010, where they even played new material, most notably a track entitled &quot;Five Golden Rings&quot; in full. Despite this, the band would privately struggle to work on the album for over three years. The band went through extended periods of tension and frustration, with members, most notably Boge with the rest of the band, not getting along. Boge desired for the band to return to their heavier, earlier sound of the initial EP and&quot; Begins Here&quot; album. Conversely, the rest of the band wanted to push forward even further into progressive territory, as they had with &quot;Final Conversation of Kings&quot; album, and incorporate further unconventional instruments for rock music into their songs, such as mandolin or bells.

After months of the band struggling with their work on the album or get along with one another, in mid-September 2011, Boge privately announced to the band that he would be leaving. However, with the internal struggles being entirely unknown to the general public at the time, the band kept it secret until February 2012, where, in press release, they announced that Boge had left amicably to pursue other interests. In the meantime, the band participated in a number of &quot;Tenth Anniversary&quot; concerts through October 2011, where the band felt a large sense of relief, knowing that there was an end to their internal struggles, and being able to focus on playing music rather than create it. This cemented their view on Boge leaving, but also inspired them to do one last tour together; in February 2012, upon announcing Boge&#x27;s departure, they also announced that they would do a farewell tour, and release a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, both entitled &quot;Effected&quot;.

The tour ran from April to June 2012. During the time, Boge expanded more on why he left, and the band&#x27;s turmoil. Boge described resentment of the official press release, stating that calling it &quot;amicable&quot; was &quot;bullshit&quot;, and that it entirely came down to members not getting along or respecting him. He blamed himself as well, stating: &quot;&#x27;If I&#x27;ve lost the faith from my bandmates to produce what I think are the best melodies...&#x27; and to have that trust taken away, then I couldn&#x27;t go on working like that. Not only that, but I don&#x27;t want to be the weak link in a band. I don&#x27;t want to be the guy that&#x27;s not pulling his weight. That was another reason, too. I thought, &#x27;If that was the case, I&#x27;ve got to go.&quot; 

After the band&#x27;s farewell tour concluded in June 2012, Boge left the band and worked with his other band, Thousand Needles in Red, while the remaining three members started the search for a new lead singer in order to resume work on a fourth studio album.

In August 2013, the band released their DVD &quot;Effected&quot;, a two-DVD set featuring a live recording of the Melbourne show of the &quot;Effected&quot; tour and a documentary outlining the band&#x27;s career and internal struggles up until that point. The DVD debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA music DVD chart.

In September 2013, the band announced an Australian tour for October, shortly after announcing Paul Galagher as the band&#x27;s new lead singer. The band released their first and only single with Galagher entitled &quot;Eyes Down&quot;, at the same time. After a second period of years of public silence and inactivity, the band officially announced their disbandment in August 2016.

=== 2017–present: Reunion and &quot;IV&quot;===
In July 2017, the band announced the reformation of their original lineup, with Boge again as the lead singer, and announced they would begin touring Australia again in March 2018.

In June 2022, the band announced their fourth album, &quot;IV&quot;, would be released in late 2022 and that they would tour Australia in September and October 2022. In August 2023, the band announced a 20th anniversary tour for &quot;Begins Here&quot; to take place in February 2024.

<text>IWC International Watch Co. AG, founded International Watch Company, better known as IWC Schaffhausen, is a Swiss luxury watch manufacturer located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Originally founded in Switzerland by American watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones in 1868, the company was transferred to the Rauschenbach family in 1880 after bankruptcy and has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group since 2000.

IWC is best known for its luxury pilot/aviation watches and for being a pioneer in the use of ceramic and titanium in watchmaking. In 2018 IWC was recognized by the WWF for its environmental efforts and received an &quot;Ambitious&quot; rating; placing first amongst fifteen other Swiss watchmakers.

== History ==

===Creation===
In 1868, American engineer and watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones (1841–1916), who had been a director of E. Howard &amp; Co., in Boston founded the International Watch Company. He planned to assemble watches in Switzerland and import them into the United States. At the time, wages in Switzerland were relatively low although there was a ready supply of skilled watchmaking labor, mainly carried out by people in their homes. Jones encountered opposition to his plans in French-speaking Switzerland because Jones wanted to open a factory.

In 1850 the town of Schaffhausen was in danger of being left behind in the Industrial Age. At this stage, watch manufacturer and industrialist Heinrich Moser built Schaffhausen&#x27;s first hydroelectric plant and aided in further industrialization. He met F.A. Jones in Le Locle and showed great interest in his plans. Together, they laid the foundations for the only watch manufacturers in north-eastern Switzerland. The brand was previously known as the International Watch Chronology.

===Early stages and bankruptcy===

In 1869 F.A. Jones rented the first factory premises in an industrial building owned by J.H. Moser at the Rheinstrasse. Having to rent further rooms in the Oberhaus By 1874 plans were already being made for a new factory and a site was purchased from Moser&#x27;s hydroelectric company. Schaffhausen architect, G. Meyer, won the order to design and build the factory. A year later, in the spring of 1875, the construction work was completed. At first, 196 people worked in the 45 meter long factory, which could accommodate up to 300 workplaces. However, F.A Jones had trouble selling the watches in America due to tariffs, financing, and technical machine problems. By 1875, stockholders alleged that the company was on the verge of collapse, and Jones scrambled to find new investors. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy, and Jones was forced to relinquish control of the company.

===IWC and the Rauschenbach family===
One of IWC&#x27;s stockholders, Johann Rauschenbach-Vogel, Chief Executive Officer and a machine manufacturer from Schaffhausen, took over the &quot;Internationale Uhrenfabrik&quot; on 17 February 1880. He purchased the company for 280,000 francs. Four generations of the Rauschenbach family owned IWC, with varying names.
Only a year after the sale, Johannes Rauschenbach died. His son, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenk, aged 25, took over the &quot;Uhrenfabrik von J. Rauschenbach&quot; and ran it successfully until his own death on 2 March 1905.

AUrs Haenggi from Nunningen in the canton of Solothurn had gotten to know the watch business in French-speaking Switzerland and France; in 1883 he joined IWC and stayed with the company for 52 years. He was responsible for getting factory operations up and running smoothly and acquiring new customers. He was also responsible for warding off the prospect of the outside interests acquiring IWC &quot;in the interest of the noble Rauschenbach family&quot;.

After the death of J. Rauschenbach-Schenk in 1905, his wife, two daughters, Bertha Marguerite Rauschenbach and Emma Rauschenbach (later Jung), and their husbands, Ernst Jakob Homberger (director of G. Fischer AG in Schaffhausen) and Carl Gustav Jung, took over the watch factory as an open trading company named as the &quot;Uhrenfabrik von J. Rauschenbach&#x27;s Erben&quot; - watch manufacturer of the heirs of J. Rauschenbach. E.J. Homberger was the only authorized signatory, Haenggi and Vogel were directors.

Following the death of his father-in-law, Ernst Jakob Homberger had a considerable influence on the Schaffhausen watchmaking company&#x27;s affairs and guided it through one of the most turbulent epochs in Europe&#x27;s history. Just before the world economic crisis, he took over as sole proprietor and renamed the company &quot;Uhrenfabrik von Ernst Homberger-Rauschenbach&quot;, formerly International Watch Co. His contribution was honoured in 1952, when he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of St. Gallen. He died in 1955, aged 85 years.

Hans Homberger was the third and last of the Rauschenbach heirs to run the factory as a sole proprietor. He had joined his father&#x27;s company in 1934 and took control after his death in April 1955. In 1957 he added a new wing to the factory and in the same year set up a modern pension fund for the staff. He bought new machines to meet new demands and continuously brought his production technology up to what were considered the latest standards. He died in 1986 at the age of 77.

===Prominent technicians===
Technician Johann Vogel from Wangen an der Aare in Solothurn played an important role as technical director. He designed and developed IWC calibers until 1919.

In 1885, IWC manufactured the first digital watch based on a patent granted to an Austrian by the name of Pallweber. It was a simple design, but was unable to replace the traditional analogue display.

===Electrical era===
In 1888 electricity began to take over at the watch factory. J. Rauschenbach had a powerline installed which supplied it with electricity. Shortly before the turn of the century, the company started converting its production machines to electricity. An electric motor made by Brown Boveri from Baden powered the engines in the factory. These were later replaced during the 1930s with individually powered machines.

===1900–1960===
During the period just before and after the First World War, E.J. Homberger established many social institutions. He extended the living quarters for factory employees and established a fund for widows and orphans. In 1929, the name of the fund was changed to the J. Rauschenbach Foundation and in 1949 he founded the Watch Company Welfare Foundation. Germany&#x27;s military buildup of the 1930s brought the demand for precision watches back to Glashütte. From the second half of the thirties to the end of World War II, IWC was one of five watch manufacturers (the others being Stowa, Laco, Wempe and A. Lange &amp; Söhne) that built B-Uhren for Germany&#x27;s air force (Luftwaffe).

On 1 April 1944, Schaffhausen was bombed by the United States Army Air Forces. The watch factory was hit by a bomb which failed to detonate after crashing through the rafters. The flames from incendiaries exploding nearby penetrated the building through the broken windows but were extinguished by the company&#x27;s own fire brigade.

After World War II, IWC was forced to change its focus. All of Eastern Europe had fallen under the Iron Curtain, and the economy of Germany was in shambles. As a result, old contacts and connections with other countries in Europe and the Americas as well as Australia and the Far East were revived and intensified or established.

In the mid century, IWC rolled out its famed Caliber 89 movement. This mechanically wound movement powered IWC models from the 1940s until the early 1990s.

===1970s–present===

In the 1970s and 80s, due to the quartz crisis, the Swiss watchmaking industry underwent a phase of far-reaching technological change. The era saw the first use of miniaturized electric batteries as a source of energy for wristwatches and some eventually unsuccessful technologies, such as the electronically controlled balance. The &quot;Uhrenfabrik H. E. Homberger&quot; co-founded and was a shareholder in the Centre Électronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuchâtel and was financially involved in the development of the Beta 21 quartz wristwatch movement, which was first presented to the public at the 1969 Industrial Fair in Basel and used by other manufactures such as the Omega Electroquartz watches. In value terms, this movement accounted for about 5-6% of total sales of quartz watches. Parallel to this, the company expanded its collection of jeweller watches to include ladies watches with mechanical movements. 1973 was IWC&#x27;s most successful year of the post-war period.

A rise in gold prices in 1974 had grave consequences for the watch exporting industry. Between 1970 and 1974 the price of gold rose from 4,850 to 18,000 francs and the value of the US dollar against the Swiss currency fell by up to 40%. As a result, the price of watch exports rose by as much as 250%.

A change of direction was necessary, and this led to the adoption of a number of measures. In order to survive, IWC, under the leadership of Director and CEO Otto Heller, built up a line of pocket watches, and, apart from setting up its own modern wristwatch and case manufacturing facilities, began working closely with Ferdinand A. Porsche as an external designer. In addition, IWC pioneered new watchmaking technologies, notably the first titanium bracelets, developed in 1978.

For its new plans, IWC required a high level of venture capital. With the help of the Swiss Bank Corporation, the company was put in contact with VDO Adolf Schindling AG, which took a majority interest in IWC in 1978.
At the same time, IWC reacquired the name it had originally been given by its founder F.A. Jones (International Watch Co. AG).

In 1981, Kawal Singh succeeded H.E. Homberger as general manager following the latter&#x27;s retirement. The new director, Günter Blümlein, pushed for rapid implementation of planned changes, put the existing advertising campaign to work, built up the customer base and solidified IWC&#x27;s finances.

In 1985 IWC then Director Günter Blümlein asked Kurt Klaus to create a Grande Complication watch to be worn on a wrist, as existing iterations on the market are all much larger sized Pocket Watch. In 1986, Manufacture d&#x27;Horlogerie Renaud et Papi SA&#x27;s founders Dominic Renaud and Giulio Papi assisted the design of the repeater function of the movement, before their take over by Audemars Piguet in 1992.

The IWC ref.3770 launched in 1990 was the first wristwatch-sized Grande Complication that housed a Chronograph, a Minute Repeater and a Perpetual Calendar functions.

In 1991 IWC director Günter Blümlein founded the LMH Group with its headquarters in Schaffhausen. With a 100% stake in IWC, 60% in Jaeger-LeCoultre (the other 40% was owned by Audemars Piguet), and 90% in the Saxony-based watchmaking company of A. Lange &amp; Söhne. The Group employed some 1,440 persons.

In July 2000, LMH was acquired by Richemont for CHF 2.8 billion. Despite the takeover by Richemont, IWC was guaranteed that it would continue to be managed by the same executives from the LMH Group.

In 2001 IWC went online with the Collectors Forum.

In 2011, IWC released its other Grande Complication watch, Sidérale Scafusia, taking 10 years to develop. The watch has a Celestial Chart with sunrise and sunset indications customized for each customer based on their individual locations.

In 2021, IWC CEO Christoph Grainger used a PORTL device to appear at the Watches &amp; Wonders fair in Shanghai.

In 2023, IWC launched the Ingenieur Automatic 40 in 4 colors. This newly engineered automatic models follow the bold aesthetic codes of Gérald Genta&#x27;s Ingenieur from the 1970s while meeting the highest standards regarding ergonomics, finishing, and technology.

==Motto and slogan==
IWC&#x27;s motto is &quot;Probus Scafusia&quot;, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;good, solid craftsmanship from Schaffhausen&quot;. The motto was established in 1903.

==Watch manufacturing==
===Production records===

The company began keeping detailed records for each watch that has left the factory since 1885. Since 1885, details of the caliber, materials used and cases have been entered into the records. In the case of later models, these also include the reference number, delivery date and the name of the authorized dealer. For a small fee, the owner can obtain precise information about their watch, as long as the watch is at least ten years old.

The company claims that its service department has the parts and is capable of repairing and maintaining watches from every era since IWC&#x27;s foundation in 1868.

===IWC movements===
Manufacture in-house movements include the Caliber 50000/52000, Caliber 80000/82000/89000, which feature the Pellaton winding system, using pawls rather than direct gearing between the rotor and barrel, and the pocket watch movements used in the Portuguese F.A. Jones and other IWC pocket watches. Caliber 59000 is an in-house hand-wound movement which consist of Moonphase or Tourbillon complications. Caliber 94000 consist of IWC&#x27;s patented Constant Force Tourbillon mechanism.

In response to ETA SA&#x27;s cut in supply of ébauche movements, IWC developed their new manufacture automatic and chronograph movements, Caliber 32000, Caliber 69000 as in-house designed replacements and are widely used in the Pilot, Portuguese and Ingenieur collections. Richemont Group&#x27;s Montblanc MB 25.10 movement was also based on IWC&#x27;s 69370.

In the bulk of IWC&#x27;s lower range watches significant modifications are made to the Sellita SW300 by IWC at the manufacture to create the automatic Caliber 35111.

=== Environmental rating ===

In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. IWC received a high rating as &quot;Ambitious&quot; and was ranked No. 1 among the 15 manufacturers. Being the only manufacturer examined to receive this rating. IWC was reported to have shown a &quot;serious commitment towards a sustainable transformation, but with substantial potential for improvement&quot;. Since early 2000s, IWC has been actively engaged in environmental protection and sustainable development. In 2018, IWC published a sustainability report based on the global best-practice standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

In jewelry and watchmaking industry, there are general concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world&#x27;s annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies.

==Charity auction==

Since 1997, IWC has been offering a horological item for online auction annually on its website, donating proceeds to the Ecole des Sables – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry school in Mali. The school provides education for Tuareg children.

In 2007, the Company auctioned a platinum version of the Pilot&#x27;s Watch Automatic Edition Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Reference 3201. The watch was made as a tribute to the French author and aviation pioneer. It was auctioned together with an original copy of Exupéry&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Courrier Sud&quot; (&quot;Southern Mail&quot;), featuring a handwritten dedication by the author. In 2009 IWC introduced the Big Pilot edition Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1,900 pieces. Only one of them will be in platinum and will be auctioned for charity.

==&quot;Watch International&quot;==
Four times a year, IWC publishes a customer magazine, &quot;Watch International.&quot; This publication is available in German, French, and English. The magazine includes feature stories about IWC, and other articles.

<doc id="700741" wikidata="Q2270867" url="?curid=700741" title="Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire">
<text>Stamford Bridge is a village and civil parish on the River Derwent in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, approximately east of York and west of Driffield. The village sits astride an ancient ford on the River Derwent.

Stamford Bridge is known for the Roman fort Derventio, the Battle of Stamford Bridge (1066 AD), Stamford Bridge railway station and Stamford Bridge Viaduct on the disused York–Beverley railway, and the Stamford Bridge road crossing of the River Derwent.

==Governance==
The village lies on the borders with the North Yorkshire and the City of York unitary authorities. The parish has a parish council, known as Stamford Bridge Parish Council. It is also within the boundaries of the Pocklington Provincial ward of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, which elects three councillors every four years.

==Demographics==
The population has increased in recent years due to substantial new housing developments on the south side of the town.

==History==

===Roman fort Derventio===
The Romans established a fort here about 70 AD, around which later developed a large linear civilian settlement focused on a bridge one mile (1.6 km) south of the present town.

Iter I of the Antonine Itinerary lists &quot;Derventio&quot; as being seven Roman miles from Eboracum (York) which matches the distance from York. In relation to known discoveries under the town of Malton, antiquaries always assumed that Malton should be called Derventio. The remains at Stamford Bridge were not known to them, lying undiscovered under arable and pasture fields until quite recently.

The name &quot; Derventio &quot; is of Celtic origin (&quot;&quot; &quot;oak-tree&quot;) and relates to the River Derwent. The fort had access to the Roman road network of Roman Britain via the Roman road known as Cade&#x27;s Road (Margary road 80a). 

===Viking Age===

The Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066 is often wrongly regarded as the traditional end of the Viking Age in Britain – this ignores the substantial Norse possessions in Scotland until the aftermath of the Battle of Largs in 1263. At Stamford Bridge King Harold II repelled the invading Norwegian force led by his brother Tostig Godwinson and King Harald Hardrada of Norway, but three weeks later his loss at the Battle of Hastings allowed the Norman Conquest of England.

The settlement was called &quot;Pons Belli&quot; by the Normans, meaning battle bridge. Rents of freeholders and cottagers were recorded in 1368 and there was a common oven recorded the same year.
===Recent history===
The A166 east–west road crossing the river at Stamford Bridge is one of the main roads from York to the East Riding and the coast. The road bridge in the village was closed on 5 March 2007, for just over 11 weeks, so that essential repairs could be carried out, in light of the enormous volume of traffic that uses it, exceptional for such an old bridge (dating from 1727). The bridge re-opened on 22 May.

The village suffered from record floods in November 2000 which seriously flooded 30 businesses and homes. Flood defences have now been installed, costing £3.7 million.

The 80m-long bridge, built in 1727, over the River Derwent has been struck in several traffic accidents in recent years, causing severe damage to its stone parapets. In 2024, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council invested £350,000 in repairing the Grade II listed bridge and improving road safety, following years of damage caused by vehicles.

== Natural history ==

The River Derwent divides Stamford Bridge into two. During 4/5 March 1999, exceptional levels of rainfall were experienced in the Derwent catchment area, reaching in 24‑hours, worsened by melting snow which had earlier accumulated on the North York Moors. By Sunday 7 March large areas of Stamford Bridge were under water and a final flooding depth of approximately was recorded by Monday 8 March. At the height of the flooding the River Derwent reach the peak of 5m above its normal level, the highest level ever recorded exceeding the previous highest in 1931 by .

The following year a new record flood level was set. In October 2000 the Derwent again burst its banks and peaked slightly above the 1999 flood level.

In 2003–04, new flood defences were built. The flood defences were breached, and much of the village square was under water, on the morning of 26 June 2007.

==Landmarks==

Stamford Bridge has several notable landmarks, including the Corn Mill; the stone arched bridge over the River Derwent; the Stamford Bridge Viaduct, and Stamford Bridge railway station, both ; a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, built 1828 in yellow brick; the Bay Horse Inn, late 18th to early 19th century public house; as well as &quot;Derwent Plastics factory&quot;, on the west side of the river, established in 1934 from a former brewery building.

Just east of Stamford Bridge is the manor house Burtonfields Hall, built in 1837 by the architect Anthony Salvin for Charles Darley. Darley was married to Salvin&#x27;s sister-in-law Marianne Nesfield, and their daughter married Anthony Salvin Junior. The original house was extended by W. H. Brierley in about 1898.

A memorial commemorating the Battle of Stamford Bridge overlooking the field where the battle is thought to have taken place is on Whiterose Drive.

The Cornmill is a late 18th to early 19th century Grade II listed water mill. The current mill was possibly expanded in 1847–50 when nearly £1,000 was spent on it. Subsequently, there were two water wheels and seven pairs of grinding stones. The mill ceased operation in 1964 and was converted into a restaurant in 1967. More recently the Cornmill was converted into twelve two-bedroom flats but some original equipment remains.

The present Stamford Bridge was designed by William Etty under the Stamford Bridge (Replacement and Tolls) Act 1724 and completed in 1727. The bridge was strengthened in the 1960s and at the same time the adjacent pedestrian bridge was erected. It replaced a medieval bridge made of timber supported on three stone piers, whit stood upstream of the current bridge.

The bridge is a Grade II* listed monument.

Opened on 3 October 1847, Stamford Bridge Viaduct originally carried the York to Beverley railway line across the Derwent, closed 1965. It consists of red brick arches on either side of a single wider wrought-iron span that crosses the river. The viaduct now forms part of a public cycle route, and is Grade II* listed.

== Education ==

The village school was first built in Main Street in 1795 as a result of a legacy left by Christopher Wharton. Education was provided free for 12 poor boys and 6 poor girls who had to provide one shilling a year for kindling. Pay scholars were also taught and by 1822 the school population numbered 30. 1874 saw compulsory education and in 1911 the East Riding County Council took over and built a school on the present Church Road site.

This original building was modernised and extended in 1968 and because of the rapid development of the village a further extension was added in 1978. In April 1983 a new infants building, in Godwinsway, Stamford Bridge, was added to the school. Built for 120 infant children it makes the school a split site establishment, but adds greatly to the educational provision for the children. In 2000 this building was also extended.

==Transport==

The village is served by two bus routes. The number 10 route is operated by First York (and York Pullman in the evenings) with a regular service via Dunnington to the centre of York and then Poppleton. East Yorkshire Motor Services operate an occasional service (No 747) between York and Stamford Bridge continuing to Full Sutton, Fangfoss and Pocklington. Information as at October 2011.
Stamford Bridge railway station closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. The Minsters Rail Campaign is campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The proposed re-opened railway would skirt the eastern edge of the village as the former alignment has since been developed.

<doc id="700747" wikidata="Q2381801" url="?curid=700747" title="Live (Usher album)">
<text>Live is a live album by American singer Usher. It was recorded on October 15 and 16, 1998 in the singer&#x27;s hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and released by LaFace Records on March 23, 1999. Both audio-only and video longform versions were released; it was distributed to break up the gap between Usher&#x27;s second and third studio albums, &quot;My Way&quot; (1997) and &quot;8701&quot; (2001).

&quot;Live&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics; many criticized the poor live sound of Usher&#x27;s voice on the album. &quot;Live&quot; reached number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 30 on the Top R&amp;B Albums and number 3 on the Top Music Videos. The album has sold over 200,000 copies in the United States, and both the audio and video versions have been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
==Background==
&quot;Live&quot; was released to keep Usher&#x27;s fans satisfied during the four-year break between &quot;My Way&quot; (1997) and &quot;8701&quot;, his second and third studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998), &quot;Light It Up&quot; (1999) and &quot;Texas Rangers&quot; (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 15 and 16, 1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, &quot;I really like the sound of a band, that&#x27;s one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn&#x27;t get a chance to see the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn&#x27;t get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well.&quot; Seven of the songs included on &quot;Live&quot; are from Usher&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1994) and &quot;My Way&quot;. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, &quot;Every Little Step&quot;, &quot;Rock Wit&#x27;cha&quot; and &quot;Roni&quot;—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs&#x27; &quot;Tender Love&quot; and LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;I Need Love&quot;.

&quot;Live&quot; was released in the United States by LaFace Records on March 23, 1999 by means of compact disc, cassette and VHS formats; along with the concert footage, the VHS features interviews with Usher. The audio version &quot;Live&quot; was later serviced to digital retailers for music download.

==Reception==

&quot;Live&quot; received generally negative reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic criticized Usher&#x27;s &quot;tired and weary&quot; live sound, although he praised the remixed songs at the end of the album. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; J. D. Considine gave &quot;Live&quot; a C grade and wrote that, despite Usher&#x27;s performing ability, the audio album is boring without video footage of the concerts. Neva Chonin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was unimpressed with Usher&#x27;s &quot;tinny&quot;-sounding voice on &quot;Live&quot;.

&quot;Live&quot; debuted at number 76 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the chart dated April 10, 2011, with first-week sales of 21,000 copies. The album peaked at number 73, and lasted nine weeks on the chart. On April 27, 1999 &quot;Live&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting the shipment of 500,000 units, and by the end of 2001 &quot;Live&quot; had sold over 200,000 copies in the US. It debuted and peaked at number 30 on the Top R&amp;B Albums, and remained on that chart for nine weeks. The video longform version of &quot;Live&quot; entered the US Top Music Videos chart at number four on the chart of April 10, 1999. It remained at number four for three weeks, before ascending to number three on May 1, 1999, where it peaked for one week. 
The RIAA certified the &quot;Live&quot; video gold, after it shipped 50,000 copies, on December 22, 1999. The video of the performance of &quot;Bedtime&quot; was made available at MTV.com, and the live version of &quot;Bedtime&quot; reached number 66 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart.

<text>A law dictionary (also known as legal dictionary) is a dictionary that is designed and compiled to give information about terms used in the field of law.

==Types==
Distinctions are made among various types of law dictionaries.

Differentiating factors include: 
* Number of languages covered: a monolingual law dictionary covers one language, a bilingual covers two.
* Number of fields covered: a single-field dictionary covers an entire field of law, whereas a sub-field dictionary covers a part of a field of law, e.g. a dictionary of contract law.

==Quality==
A good bilingual or multilingual law dictionary needs to take the users&#x27; expected languages and professional competences into account. The lexicographers therefore must consider the following aspects: dictionary user research, dictionary , structure, and presentation of relevant information. When making a law dictionary, the lexicographers attempt to present the information in such a way that the user is not burdened with excessive lexicographic information costs.

==Functions==
As pointed out by Sandro Nielsen in 1994, law dictionaries can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about &quot;legal matters independent of any te&quot;xt (a cognitive function) – such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have entry words in one language and definitions in another language – these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with entry words in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language.

==Formats==
With the advance of technology, the legal dictionary has made its way onto the Internet and smartphones. Law students and litigants can now look up the meaning of legal terms in seconds.

==Legal terminology textbook==
Unlike a law dictionary, which arranges and defines legal words and phrases individually and in alphabetical order, a legal terminology textbook arranges and defines legal words and phrases in groups and by topic. As a result, a student or other person interested in understanding an array of related legal words and phrases may prefer to use a legal terminology textbook instead.

<doc id="700754" wikidata="Q1954044" url="?curid=700754" title="8701">
<text>8701 is the third studio album by American singer Usher, released in the United Kingdom on July 9, 2001, and in the United States on August 7, 2001, by Arista Records. Recording was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri, Babyface, Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox, Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. Although intended for an October 31, 2000 release under the title &quot;All About U&quot;, the album was delayed numerous times, following the leak of several tracks onto the online music store Napster. Usher subsequently recorded new tracks and released the album under the new title, &quot;8701&quot;, which is derived from Usher singing for the first time in his local church in 1987 and the album&#x27;s US release date of August 7, 2001. The single &quot;Can U Help Me&quot; was supplied with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later Windows versions to showcase Windows Media Player 11 and higher WMP versions.

&quot;8701&quot; takes inspiration from multiple artists, including Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson. It follows the theme of Usher&#x27;s relationship experience, along with the emotions of love and heartache. Usher promoted the album by embarking on the supporting tour, 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, his first concert tour, to which it he performed in forty-four shows across North America. He also made appearances in television shows, including &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; and &quot;Total Request Live&quot;.

&quot;8701&quot; produced two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one singles, &quot;U Remind Me&quot; and &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, along with the top three single &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;. The album debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with 210,000 copies sold in its first week. &quot;8701&quot; has since been certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold eight million copies worldwide as of 2010. &quot;8701&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Usher&#x27;s vocals and development as an artist, but were ambivalent towards some of the album&#x27;s material. The album earned Usher numerous awards, including a BET Award, two Grammy Awards, and three &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

==Background==
Usher had initially planned to release the album entitled &quot;All About U&quot;, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful &quot;My Way&quot; (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including &quot;T.T.P.&quot;, &quot;U R the One&quot; and &quot;Pop Ya Collar&quot;. Following the event, the album&#x27;s release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000, to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that he returned to the studios to record new songs, stating &quot;I didn&#x27;t want that to be the way my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better&quot; while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site were not going to be included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher&#x27;s publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title &quot;8701&quot;, who claims that it is &quot;practically a new album&quot;. The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher&#x27;s publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the &#x27;87&#x27; segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the &#x27;01&#x27; referring to the year 2001.

==Recording==
&quot;8701&quot; was recorded in the United States, in the cities of Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis and Atlanta. The album&#x27;s production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, P. Diddy, Jermaine Dupri—who had produced the majority of Usher&#x27;s previous album, &quot;My Way&quot;—Babyface, Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher&#x27;s mother, and then manager, to contribute to &quot;8701&quot;&#x27;s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said &quot;Oh my God, Usher&#x27;s got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it&quot;. Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song &quot;Separated&quot;, along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari &amp; Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, and asked them to produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 &quot;Tender Love&quot;, performed by R&amp;B vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created &quot;Can U Help Me&quot;. Following the completion of &quot;8701&quot;, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album&#x27;s second single &quot;U Remind Me&quot;, explaining &quot;we already know he can dance, and he&#x27;s got the style and that whole thing. But I want people to just go, he can sing.

==Composition==

In an interview with MTV, Usher commented that lyrically, &quot;8701&quot; represents his &quot;soul&quot;, and elaborated by explaining that he was inspired by love and heartache; &quot;I listen to a lot of Donny Hathaway&#x27;s, Stevie Wonder&#x27;s, Marvin Gaye&#x27;s and Michael Jackson&#x27;s earlier records, those Motown greats. There&#x27;s a little bit of all of that in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then as well as in the early &#x27;90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime.&quot; Usher explained that the album&#x27;s lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; &quot;8701&quot; is predominantly an R&amp;B album. &quot;Can U Help Me&quot;, is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot; is a hip hop song inspired by Jackson, while &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; is an R&amp;B slow-jam. About &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a &quot;slow-burning bassline&quot; throughout. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;U Remind Me&quot; is also an R&amp;B track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.

==Singles==
&quot;Pop Ya Collar&quot; was released from Usher&#x27;s previously intended third studio album &quot;All About U&quot; as the first single. Following the song&#x27;s leak on online music store Napster, along with several other tracks, it was added to some editions of &quot;8701&quot;. It entered and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, but was less successful in the United States, peaking at number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 25 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. &quot;8701&quot; first official single was &quot;U Remind Me&quot;, released on May 22, 2001. The song sold nearly 100,000 copies in its opening week and received positive reviews from most critics, who cited it as a highlight from the album. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, for four consecutive weeks. &quot;U Remind Me&quot; also reached the top five in several countries, including France, Belgium (Wallonia), New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Australia. It has been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, featuring rapper-producer P. Diddy, was planned as the album&#x27;s second single. It received radio play prior to the release of &quot;U Remind Me&quot;, peaking at number 68 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and a video was to be produced in Los Angeles, directed by Diddy.

The album&#x27;s second single was instead &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, released on August 21, 2001. Like its predecessor, the song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It was number one for a single week, before being replaced by Nickelback&#x27;s &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; for four weeks. The song then returned to the top, replacing the latter song for four more weeks. &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; also achieved chart success in other territories, reaching the top five in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The song has been certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot; was released as the third single on January 18, 2002. It impacted the Hot 100, peaking at number three, and the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, at number two. It was released with P. Diddy&#x27;s &quot;I Need a Girl (Part One)&quot; in the UK as a B-side single, and reached number four. &quot;U-Turn&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single on March 11, 2002, as an international single. It reached the top ten in Belgium and Australia. &quot;Can U Help Me&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single on August 20, 2002. It peaked at number 57 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 30 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart.

==Release and promotion==
Usher initially planned to release his third studio album on October 31, 2000, under the title &quot;All About U&quot;, but due to the leak of multiple tracks several months prior to the date, it was delayed. First to December 5, 2000, it was delayed again to June 17, 2001. In regards to this, Usher commented that &quot;Pushing the record back was a risk, but I thought it would build anticipation&quot;. &quot;8701&quot; final release date was July 9, 2001 in the United Kingdom and August 7, 2001, on Arista Records, in the United States, Australia and Canada. On the day of release of the album in the United States, to which Arista labelled as &quot;Usher day&quot;, Usher performed the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;U Remind Me&quot; on the show &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot;. He also performed the single during the 2001 BET Awards and the United We Stand: What More Can I Give concert at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C., which was held in tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Usher appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, attended an auto-graph signing session in a Virgin mega store, and a listening session for the album in the Planet Hollywood restaurant. Usher performed &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; at the 2002 American Music Awards, and again on June 16, 2002, at the Tweeter Center along with &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot; during his concert.

==Critical reception==

&quot;8701&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 11 reviews. &quot;NME&quot; Lucy O&#x27;Brien commended Usher for producing a more mature album, that &quot;reflects his emotional experience&quot; writing &quot;Versatility is the key here: staccato beats with mellifluous melody, rich slow-jams and edgy harmonies – but woven through with Usher&#x27;s own perspective. A winner.&quot; BBC Online&#x27;s Christian Hopwood also favoured the album, commenting on how Usher has developed &quot;his producing, singing and song writing skills to a new level&quot; noting his contribution to twelve of the seventeen tracks. Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music declared the album an improvement &quot;over Usher&#x27;s &quot;old&quot; new album&quot;—&quot;All About You&quot;—and depicted it as his best work to-date. Leroy credited the production groups The Neptunes and Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, depicting that they have done &quot;some of their best work&quot; on the album. J. D. Considine of &quot;Blender&quot; commented that the album &quot;does what it&#x27;s supposed to, giving Usher a grown-up R&amp;B sound without reducing his boyish charm&quot;. Kathryn McGuire of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Usher&#x27;s vocals as &quot;velvety&quot; and further wrote that &quot;Amid all the playboy pouting and preening, Usher&#x27;s vocals are impressively adaptable [...]. McGuire noted the album&#x27;s primary fault is that &quot;Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer&quot;, with every track being formulaic, or &quot;radio-safe&quot;.

Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; noted the distinction between several of the album&#x27;s songs with Janet Jackson&#x27;s, while comparing Usher&#x27;s vocals to that of another Jackson member, Michael Jackson &quot;[...] bring out the other Jackson in Usher, bolstering falsetto vocal bridges on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; and &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot; that are undeniably Pop Royalty.&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot; Jason King complimented some of the material on the album, but was disappointed with the &quot;heavyweight producers&quot; not producing any &quot;masterpieces&quot;. Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic gave a positive opinion on Usher&#x27;s development, writing &quot;He looks good, his material is smooth and seductive, and he has a nice voice, even if he tends to favor melisma&quot;. Erlewine also labelled the album as &quot;a classy, seductive affair&quot; but was ambivalent towards its material, due to the lack of memorable tracks. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Josh Tyrangiel said that the tracks &quot;blend harmlessly together&quot;, but was ambivalent towards the quality of the songs produced after Usher&#x27;s four-year hiatus.

===Accolades===
The album earned Usher numerous accolades. At the 44th Grammy Awards he won his first Grammy, for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance Male (for &quot;U Remind Me&quot;). The following year, at the 45th Grammy Awards, he won the award again, for &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;. As an act Usher won several awards, including three &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Awards in 2002, for Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Artist, Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Male Artist and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artist, and a BET Award for Best R&amp;B Artist. At the 2002 Soul Train Music Awards, the album earned him an award for Male R&amp;B/Soul Album. In December 2009, the album and its single, &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, were ranked as some of the best records of the 2000–2009 decade. The former was positioned at number sixty-three and the latter at number fifteen, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Hot 100 Decade-End Charts. In 2008, &quot;U Got It Bad&quot; was ranked as one of the all-time Hot 100 songs, positioned at number ninety-nine.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number-four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Chart selling 210,000 copies in its first week; it was the second highest debut of the week, behind Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Eternal&quot;. The album exceeded its predecessor&#x27;s sales, &quot;My Way&quot; (1997), which debuted at number fifteen selling 66,000 copies in its opening week. Eighteen weeks after the release of &quot;8701&quot;, it had sold 1.94 million copies, and was predicted to be on pace to out-sell &quot;My Way&quot;, which sold 1.32 million units during the same period. On the week of February 25, 2002 &quot;8701&quot; total sales stood at 3.2 million and it was charted at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By March 9, 2010, the album had sold 4.7 million copies in the United States, and had received a 4× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The album debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, and spent three weeks on the chart. It topped the UK Albums Chart on the week ending July 21, 2001, and spent a total of 59 weeks on the chart.

<text>Chișinău International Airport (; ) is Moldova&#x27;s main international airport, located southeast of the centre of Chișinău, the capital city. It served as headquarters for Air Moldova, the country&#x27;s national airline.

On 18 January 2024, the IATA airport code KIV, derived from Kishinev (the Russian and former English name of the city), was changed to RMO (&quot;Republica Moldova&quot;, &quot;Republic of Moldova&quot; in Romanian). It is the only airport in Moldova with regular passenger flights.

==History==
===Early years===
The first scheduled flights to Chișinău started on 24 June 1926, on the route Bucharest–Galați–Chișinău and Iași. The flights were operated by CFRNA, later LARES. A commemorative plaque, describing the first flight to Chișinău, was placed in the airport.
The main terminal was built in the 1970s, with a capacity of 1,200,000 passengers per year.

===Development since the 1990s===

On 31 May 1995, Chișinău Airport was awarded the status of an international airport.

A major modernization and renovation of the airport was completed in 2002 by the Turkish company Akfen Holding. An annex terminal building with an area of was added to the renovated old terminal building of . The project covered the construction of curtain walls, composite panels, asphalt road, a treatment plant with a capacity of a day, complete mechanical heating, ventilation and electrical systems, along with the X-ray security, luggage handling, master clock, and flight information systems. The annual capacity of the airport increased to 5.4 million passengers.

Chișinău International Airport is a member of Airports Council International.

The airport closed temporarily on 24 February 2022, as Moldovan airspace was closed in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 22 March 2022, the Civil Aviation Authority of Moldova partially reopened the country&#x27;s airspace, which led to the resumption of operations at the airport.

On 14 March 2023, WizzAir suspended flights to/from Moldova due to concerns over airspace safety. After this, Igor Grosu, the president of the Moldovan Parliament, met with representatives of Ryanair to convince the company to operate flights at the airport, in order to replace Wizz Air as its main low-cost airline.

There were ten check-in desks and five gates at the airport in 2009. VIP and CIP guests are offered special services at the VIP terminal. A visitors&#x27; terrace on the second floor opened in December 2006.

Previously, passengers had to present their passport, ticket and their registration (of foreigners – which used to be required). Passengers were allowed in the check-in hall. With the introduction of e-tickets and the abolition of the registration for foreigners, the airport reorganised in late 2006. This resulted in a bigger check-in hall, and customs control is now after check-in.

There are plans to enlarge the airport. The project involves a €19 million loan to Chișinău International Airport for the rehabilitation and upgrade of the existing runway, taxiways, aprons, and ramps, engineering works, safety equipment and other connected core assets of Chișinău International Airport. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is considering co-financing alongside the EBRD for up to an equal amount. Towards the end of 2017, plans for a second runway were unveiled. This runway would take the place of the current taxiway just north of the existing runway. The project began in early 2017. Runway 09–27 started operations on 13 September 2018.

<doc id="700767" wikidata="Q577647" url="?curid=700767" title="Masters Qualifying Event">
<text>The Masters Qualifying Event was a professional snooker tournament, which ran from 1990 to 2009. Each season, the winner of the event was awarded a wild-card to play at the Masters.

== History ==
At the 1990 Masters two wild-cards were added to the tournament and the following season a qualifying tournament was established for one of these wild-cards. The tournament was named Benson &amp; Hedges Championship. The event was held in Glasgow and Alan McManus became the inaugural champion.

In the 1992/1993 season it became one of the minor-ranking events along with the three Strachan Challenge events. These events carried one-tenth of the ranking points of other tournaments. but most of the top players did not enter, so it lost ranking status from the next season. The event was then moved to Edinburgh in 1994/1995 for three years, to Malvern in 1997/1998 for four years and to Mansfield in 2001/2002 for two years.

In 2003/2004 the event was renamed to Masters Qualifying Event due to restrictions on tobacco advertising in the United Kingdom. The event was held in Prestatyn; the top 16 players were excluded from the event and other non-participating Main Tour members were replaced by top players from the Challenge Tour Order of Merit. After a season away, the Masters Qualifying Event returned to the calendar in 2005/2006, and was moved to the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield next season for three years. The event was last held in Prestatyn during the 2009/10 season.

There has been five official maximum breaks during the history of the tournament. Karl Burrows made the first against Adrian Rosa in 1999. The second was made in 2000 by David McLellan against Steve Meakin, the third in 2001 by Shaun Murphy against Adrian Rosa and the fourth in 2002 by Tony Drago against Stuart Bingham. The last came at the 2005 event by Bingham against Marcus Campbell. There was one further maximum break by Terry Murphy against Robert Thallon but it was not officially ratified due to the match being played on one of the outside non-templated tables.

<doc id="700771" wikidata="Q204617" url="?curid=700771" title="Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)">
<text>Under My Skin is the second studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. It was released firstly in Europe on May 21, 2004 then it followed the release in the rest of the world on May 25, 2004 by Arista Records and RCA Records. Lavigne wrote most of the album with singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, who invited her to a Malibu in-house recording studio shared by Kreviazuk and her husband Raine Maida, where Lavigne recorded many of the songs. The album was produced by Maida, Don Gilmore, and Butch Walker. It was Lavigne&#x27;s second and final studio album to be released by Arista, following &quot;&quot;Let Go&quot;&quot; (2002). It was also her first album for RCA. 

&quot;Under My Skin&quot; debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It sold three million copies in the United States, ranking the album number 149 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 decade-end chart. Because of the album&#x27;s darker, heavier, more aggressive vibe reminiscent of post-grunge and more melodic rock songs, it received generally positive reception from critics at the point of considering it as one of the classic albums that defined pop-punk music in the early 00s (despite it not being usually classified as such), and also one of the works that anticipated the emotional intensity and theatrical aesthetics of emo pop music in the mainstream. On March 18, 2013, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; was re-released as a double-disc set paired with her debut studio album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, which was released under Arista Records. To promote the album, Lavigne went on a promotional tour for malls in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, Lavigne embarked on a concert tour, entitled the Bonez Tour, starting on September 26, 2004, and ending one year later on September 26, 2005. The concert at the Budokan arena in Japan was filmed and released on a DVD only available in Japan, entitled &quot;Bonez Tour 2005: Live at Budokan&quot;. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; has sold over 10 million copies worldwide and is the fifth best selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. 

Critics described &quot;Under My Skin&quot; as post-grunge, alternative rock, and nu metal containing some gothic rock, grunge, folk rock, and hard rock influences.

==Background==
Having no plans of working with producers or professional writers, Lavigne wrote much of the album with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, with whom she had developed a friendship in the summer of 2003. Kreviazuk, whose husband Raine Maida&#x27;s band Our Lady Peace opened for Lavigne&#x27;s concert in Europe, introduced herself at an after-party for the SARS benefit concerts held in Toronto in June 2003. The following day, Lavigne and Kreviazuk ate lunch together, during which Lavigne shared how she wanted the development of the album to be. They wrote songs for almost three weeks at Maida&#x27;s warehouse in Toronto. Kreviazuk invited Lavigne to continue working in a Malibu, California house she shared with Maida, which contained a recording studio. Many of the tracks on the album were recorded in Malibu.

Kreviazuk suggested Maida produce songs for the album, an ability Lavigne did not possess. Maida produced five songs, including &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, which he co-wrote with Lavigne. Lavigne also invited two other producers: Don Gilmore, who produced three songs, two of which were written by Lavigne and Kreviazuk, and Butch Walker who also produced three songs in three days. Lavigne also co-wrote one track, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot;, with Ben Moody, formerly of Evanescence, and the rest with her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld.

On her website, Lavigne states that she had learned a lot since her first record, &quot;Let Go&quot;: &quot;I was involved in every aspect of making this record. I&#x27;m very hands-on. I knew how I wanted the drums, the guitar tones, and the structures to be. I understand the whole process so much better this time because I&#x27;ve been through it. I&#x27;m really picky with my sound.&quot; Regarding the album&#x27;s theme, Lavigne stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve gone through so much, so that&#x27;s what I talk about...Like boys, like dating or relationships&quot;.

==Release and singles==
&quot;Under My Skin&quot; was released on May 12, 2004, in Japan and later on May 25, 2004, in the United States and worldwide. Lavigne released four official singles from the album, and two promotional singles.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was the first single from the album, written by Lavigne and Evan Taubenfeld and produced by Butch Walker. It earned Lavigne a nomination at the 2004 MTV VMAs, and charted at number 22 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number five in the UK Singles Charts and the top 10 in Australia.
* &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; was the second single; it was written by Lavigne alongside its producer Butch Walker. The song returned &quot;Under My Skin&quot; to number one in Canada for several weeks, and to the top five in Germany, the UK, Australia, and other European countries. It was Lavigne&#x27;s fourth number one single on the US Mainstream Top 40 and was her second platinum single since &quot;Complicated&quot; (2002). The song became a worldwide hit.
* &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; was the third single released from the album, written by Lavigne and former Evanescence member Ben Moody and produced by Don Gilmore. The song peaked lower in most countries than some of her previous singles.
* &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t&quot; was the fourth single from the album, written by Lavigne and Chantal Kreviazuk and produced by Raine Maida. Despite charting in several countries, it was not a significant hit, failing to reach the top 20 in most markets. It was not released in the United States, where &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; was released instead.
* &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; was released in North America on April 18, 2005.

===Other songs===
* &quot;Take Me Away&quot; was also a radio-only single first released in Canada and later in Australia. In Canada, it was a promotional single preceding &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;.

==Critical reception==

According to Metacritic, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; received an average rating of 65, reflecting a generally positive reception from critics.. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; suggested that in the album, &quot;Lavigne has become even more, well, complicated&quot;, noting she &quot;sounds more burdened&quot;. Browne adds, &quot;As contrived as the results can be, there&#x27;s no denying the level of craft at work.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant&quot; magazine noted that Lavigne&#x27;s sound was now much heavier and darker and compared her to Amy Lee of Evanescence, as did Browne. Carly Carioli of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine also agreed, stating &quot;she has deepened and darkened her sound without sacrificing her platinum-plated melodies&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Lavigne&#x27;s vocals, &quot;blankness is what makes her best songs so irresistible. Whether it&#x27;s a fit of faux punk or a maudlin ballad, she sings it all absolutely straight&quot;. Musically the album&#x27;s sound is compared to &quot;that of crunching punk guitars playing mighty power chords, all mixed with the same flawless elan that has characterized pop-punk ever since Green Day dropped &quot;Dookie&quot;&quot; says Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot;. Andrew Strickland of Yahoo! Music agreed, &quot;the girl can use those tiny lungs to great effect...she knows when to croon and when to yell&quot;. 

On a more mixed note, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album is &quot;a bit awkward, sometimes sounding tentative and unsure, sometimes clicking and surging on Avril&#x27;s attitude and ambition.&quot; Erlewine compared Lavigne to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Cinquemani cited Lavigne&#x27;s lyrics as her &quot;biggest weakness&quot; and Strickland agreed, stating, &quot;we have a maturing Ms Lavigne, distancing herself from the teen antics of her &quot;Let Go&quot; debut, but struggling to find any stories worth telling&quot;. Tim O&#x27;Neil of &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated &quot;Lavigne&#x27;s songwriting on the bulk of Under My Skin just seems rote&quot; and goes on to call &quot;Under My Skin&quot; &quot;a good, if slightly disappointing, follow-up&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis lambasted the album, calling it a &quot;flesh-eating virus&quot; and criticised the lyrics, stating &quot;the music is so anodyne that you don&#x27;t pay much attention to Lavigne&#x27;s lyrics. This proves to be a small mercy&quot;. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is included in an article about Petridis&#x27; worst reviewed albums of modern times.

To promote &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, Lavigne went on the &quot;Live and by Surprise Tour&quot;, a 21-city mall tour in the United States and Canada. The venue in each city wasn&#x27;t announced until 48 hours before the show, which began on March 5, 2004, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the week &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was released to radio. Accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld, Lavigne performed a short live acoustic version of five songs from the album. The set also included &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; from &quot;Let Go&quot;. Selections of this tour were released on the &quot;Live Acoustic&quot; EP, which was released exclusively in Target stores.

===Bonez Tour===
To further promote the album, Lavigne embarked on a world concert tour during 2004 and 2005. The Bonez Tour visited North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. The 140-show tour began on September 26, 2004, and ended one year later on September 25, 2005. Opening acts for the concerts included Simple Plan and Butch Walker. At some shows, Lavigne covered songs such as &quot;American Idiot&quot; by Green Day and &quot;All the Small Things&quot; by Blink-182. The live performance at the Budokan Stadium was recorded on the DVD &quot;Bonez Tour 2005: Live at Budokan&quot;, which was only made available in Japan.

<doc id="700777" wikidata="Q619950" url="?curid=700777" title="Council of Jerusalem">
<text>The Council of Jerusalem or Apostolic Council is a council described in chapter 15 of the Acts of the Apostles, held in Jerusalem .

The council decided that Gentiles who converted to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the rules prescribed to the Jews by the Mosaic Law, such as Jewish dietary laws and other specific rituals, including the rules concerning circumcision of males. The council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals that were strangled, and on fornication and idolatry, sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree. The purpose and origin of these four prohibitions is debated.

Accounts of the council are found in Acts of the Apostles (chapter 15 in two different forms, the Alexandrian and Western versions) and also possibly in Paul&#x27;s letter to the Galatians (chapter 2). Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem, while others have defended this identification.

==Historical background==

Jerusalem was the first center of the Christian Church according to the Book of Acts and (according to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;) the location of &quot;the first Christian church&quot;. The apostles lived and taught there for some time after Pentecost. James the Just, brother of Jesus was leader of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, and his other kinsmen likely held leadership positions in the surrounding area after the destruction of the city until its rebuilding as &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot; in , when all Jews were banished from Jerusalem.

The apostles Barnabas and Paul went to Jerusalem to meet with the &quot;Pillars of the Church&quot;: James the Just, Peter, and John. The Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to , roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus (between AD 26 and 36). Acts 15 and Galatians 2 both suggest that the meeting was called to debate the legitimacy of the evangelizing mission of Barnabas and Paul to the Gentiles and the Gentile converts&#x27; freedom from most of the Mosaic Law, especially from the circumcision of males, a practice that was considered execrable and repulsive in the Greco-Roman world during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean, and was especially disdained in Classical civilization both from ancient Greeks and Romans, which instead valued the foreskin positively.

At the time, most followers of Jesus (which historians refer to as Jewish Christians) were Jewish by birth and even converts would have considered the early Christians as a part of Judaism. According to scholars, the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of the contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah.

==Issues and outcome==

The purpose of the meeting, according to Acts, was to resolve a disagreement in Antioch, which had wider implications than just circumcision, since circumcision is considered the &quot;everlasting&quot; sign of the Abrahamic covenant in Judaism (). The Acts say that &quot;certain men which came down from Judaea&quot; were preaching that you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved&quot;; Acts states that furthermore some of the Pharisees who had become believers stated that it was &quot;needful to circumcise [the Gentiles,] and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses&quot; (KJV).

The primary issue which was addressed related to the requirement of circumcision, as the author of Acts relates, but other important matters arose as well, as the Apostolic Decree indicates. The dispute was between those such as the followers of the &quot;Pillars of the Church&quot;, led by James, who believed that the church must observe the Torah (i.e. the rules of traditional Judaism ()), and Paul the Apostle, who called himself &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;, who believed there was no such necessity. The main concern for Paul, which he subsequently expressed in greater detail with his letters directed to the early Christian communities in Asia Minor, was the inclusion of Gentiles into God&#x27;s New Covenant, sending the message that faith in Christ is sufficient for salvation.

At the council, following advice offered by Peter ( and ), Barnabas and Paul gave an account of their ministry among the gentiles (), and James quoted from the words of the prophet Amos (, quoting ). James added his own words to the quotation: &quot;Known to God from eternity are all His works&quot; and then submitted a proposal, which was accepted by the Church and became known as the Apostolic Decree:

 sets out the content of the letter written in accordance with James&#x27; proposal. The Western version of Acts (see Acts of the Apostles: Manuscripts) adds the negative form of the Golden Rule (&quot;and whatever things ye would not have done to yourselves, do not do to another&quot;).

This determined questions wider than that of circumcision, particularly dietary questions, fornication, idolatry, and blood, as well as the application of Biblical law to non-Jews. It was stated by the apostles and elders in the council: &quot;the Holy Spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.&quot; (Acts 15:27–28) This Apostolic Decree was considered binding on all the other local Christian congregations in other regions.

The author of Acts gives an account of a restatement by James and the elders in Jerusalem of the contents of the letter on the occasion of Paul&#x27;s final Jerusalem visit, immediately prior to Paul&#x27;s arrest at the temple, recounting: &quot;When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.&quot; (Acts 21:17–18, ESV) The elders then proceed to notify Paul of what seems to have been a common concern among Jewish believers, that he was teaching diaspora Jewish converts to Christianity &quot;to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.&quot; They remind the assembly that, &quot;as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality&quot;. In the view of some scholars, the reminder of James and the elders here is an expression of concern that Paul was not fully teaching the decision of the Jerusalem Council&#x27;s letter to Gentiles, particularly in regard to non-strangled kosher meat, which contrasts with Paul&#x27;s advice to Gentiles in Corinth, to &quot;eat whatever is sold in the meat markets&quot; (1 Corinthians 10:25).

The description of the Apostolic Council in Acts 15, generally considered the same event described in Galatians 2, is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account. The historicity of Luke&#x27;s account in Acts has been challenged and was rejected by some scholars in the mid to late 20th century. However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the Jerusalem Council and its rulings as a historical event, though this is sometimes expressed with caution. Bruce Metzger&#x27;s &quot;Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament&quot; includes a summary of current research on the topic as of about 1994:
==Origin of the Council&#x27;s decision==


The Council of Jerusalem retained the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals that were strangled, and on fornication and idolatry. The resulting Apostolic Decree in Acts 15 may simply parallel the seven Noahide laws found in the Old Testament, and thus be a commonality rather than a differential. However, modern scholars dispute the connection between Acts 15 and the seven Noahide laws. The Apostolic Decree may have been a major act of differentiation of the early Church from its Jewish roots.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; states:

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; also states:

The 20th-century American Catholic priest and biblical scholar Joseph A. Fitzmyer disputes the claim that the Apostolic Decree is based on the seven Noahide laws (), and instead proposes as the basis for it. (&quot;See also&quot;: Leviticus 18).

==Obsolescence==

While the prohibitions of the Apostolic Decree were reiterated in the Apostolic Canons and at the Council in Trullo, it &quot;has been obsolete for centuries in the West&quot;, according to the 19th-century German Catholic bishop Karl Josef von Hefele, though it is still nominally recognized and observed by Eastern Orthodox Christians.

The apostolic decree was defined by the Council of Florence to have been obsolete when the distinction between Jewish and gentile converts had disappeared:

This reasoning was repeated in Pope Urban VIII&#x27;s Creed for Oriental converts of 1642 and Pope Benedict XIV&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Ex Quo&quot; of 1756.

<text>Monk Bretton Priory is a ruined medieval priory located in the village of Lundwood, and close to Monk Bretton, South Yorkshire, England.

==History==
Originally a monastery under the Cluniac order, Monk Bretton Priory is located in the village of Lundwood, in the borough of Barnsley, England. It was founded in 1154 as the Priory of St. Mary Magdelene of Lund by Adam Fitswane, sited on the Lund, from Old Norse. In the course of time, the priory took the name of the nearby village of Bretton to be commonly known as Monk Bretton Priory.

==The Notton bequest==

John de Birthwaite was Prior of Monk Bretton in 1350. In that year Sir William de Notton, a powerful local landowner, who was later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and his wife Isabel, conveyed to him lands at Fishlake, Monk Bretton, Moseley and Woolley. The purpose of the grant was to build a chantry chapel at Woolley Church. Notton directed that prayers were to be said for the souls of himself, Isabel, their children, and also King Edward III, Queen Philippa of Hainault and their children. The date suggests that Notton made the grant as his way of giving thanks for England&#x27;s deliverance from the first outbreak of the Black Death.

==Dissolution==

The monastery closed on 30 November 1538 during the dissolution, and the site passed into the ownership of the Blithman family. In 1580 the land was again sold to George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury who gave the estate to his fourth son Henry on his marriage to Elizabeth Rayner. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is now in the care of English Heritage.

Excavations concentrating on the church and cloister took place on the site in the 1920s which were published by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and other largely unrecorded diggings by the Ministry of Works took place during the 1950s. More recently the site has been the focus of a survey and excavation project run by Dr Hugh Willmott from the University of Sheffield.

<text>This is a list of two-tier counties of England by population.

It includes those non-metropolitan counties (also known as shire counties) with a two-tier county council structure and does not include metropolitan counties or unitary authorities.

Where a unitary authority has separated from a shire county the population of the unitary authority is counted elsewhere. For example, the population of Blackpool is not included in Lancashire in this table.

The figures are mid-year estimates for from the Office for National Statistics.

Densities are calculated from population and area values.

<text>This Sceptred Isle is a BBC radio series, written by historian Christopher Lee, about the story of the lands and peoples of Britain. It was produced by Pete Atkin and broadcast in 1995 twice each day – in the morning and late at night – on Radio 4. The series comprised 216 episodes, each 12–14 minutes long, and had a total duration of 46 hours. A 29-hour-long abridged version of the programmes has been issued on CD as part of the BBC Radio Collection.

==Title==
The programme&#x27;s title is a quotation from Act 2, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;King Richard II&quot;, attributed to John of Gaunt:

This royal throne of kings, this scepter&#x27;d isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars ... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England

==Episodes==
Beginning in 55 BC with the arrival of Julius Caesar and initially concluding in 1901 with the death of Queen Victoria, the series was read by Anna Massey and included extracts from the book &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot; written by Sir Winston Churchill, interwoven into Christopher Lee&#x27;s main account of the history. The extracts were read by Paul Eddington, who died during the production and his role was taken by Peter Jeffrey. In total the series contained 216 episodes, ran 46 hours, and was first broadcast in daily episodes between June 1995 and June 1996.

===Extensions and spin-offs===
In 1999 the BBC and Christopher Lee extended the programme to cover the 20th century: from 1901, where the original series had ended, to the end of the millennium. This extension, 15.25 hours long, was broadcast from 30 August to 31 December 1999. The narrator was retained from the original series but quotations were read by Robert Powell.

In 2001 another shorter series entitled &quot;This Sceptred Isle: Dynasties&quot; was produced. This told the stories of the powerful and influential families of Britain and Ireland, including the Godwines, the Despensers and the Churchills. These are the tales of the powerful families who were there before the monarch was, and who were still there long after his or her reign - or even royal dynasty - had come to an end. The series consisted of 10 episodes and was again written by Christopher Lee and narrated by Anna Massey.

Over the course of several months in 2005 and 2006 Christopher Lee&#x27;s &quot;This Sceptred Isle: Empire&quot;, a 90-part history of the British Empire was broadcast on Radio 4. Each part was 15 minutes long. The narrator was Juliet Stevenson and the cast of readers of various historical documents–such as poems, songs, personal letters, and first-hand accounts–included Jack Davenport, Joss Ackland, Christopher Eccleston, and Anna Massey among others.

<doc id="700793" wikidata="Q543362" url="?curid=700793" title="Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)">
<text>&quot;Complicated&quot; is the debut single by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne from her debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002). It was released on 11 March 2002 by Arista Records. Lavigne and production team the Matrix (Lauren Christy, Scott Spock, and Graham Edwards) are credited as writers. Production on the song was helmed by the Matrix. According to Lavigne, the song is about being honest with oneself rather than &quot;putting on a face&quot;.

&quot;Complicated&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the song as infectious pop rock. &quot;Complicated&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, ultimately selling 1.1 million copies in the US. The song also spent a consecutive sixteen weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 chart, breaking a record previously held by Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s &quot;Torn&quot;. Internationally, &quot;Complicated&quot; topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway, with the song peaking in the top five in over twenty countries. &quot;Complicated&quot; was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

==Background and release==
After being signed to Arista Records, Lavigne moved to New York and began working on her debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, collaborating with a host of prime songwriters and producers. For a year, nothing was working for Lavigne and was on the verge of getting dropped off Arista. The management pitched her songs written by other songwriters, but she declined, insisting she wanted to write songs herself. Lavigne relocated to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter-producer Clif Magness, who gave her ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;, songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album. However, Arista was not thrilled with the heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.

Lavigne came to the attention of the three-piece production team the Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team&#x27;s manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together. According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne&#x27;s early songs and felt they contained &quot;a Faith Hill kind of vibe&quot;. As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, the Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, the singer said she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into &quot;Complicated&quot; and another song called &quot;Falling Down&quot;. They played it to Lavigne, inspiring her musical path.

When Josh Sarubin, the A&amp;R executive who signed Lavigne to the imprint, heard the song, he knew it was right for her. Lavigne presented the song to Reid, who agreed the musical direction Lavigne and the Matrix were taking, and set &quot;Complicated&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single.

==Composition==
Composed in the key of F major, &quot;Complicated&quot; is a pop rock song about how people can feign or pretend in front of others. Lavigne said about the song: &quot;People sometimes bother me how they&#x27;re not real and how they&#x27;re just, like, putting on a face and being two-faced&quot;. Lavigne stated that she experienced this with both boyfriends and female friends.

==Critical reception==
The song was met with generally positive reviews. In 2009, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted &quot;Complicated&quot; as the eighth top single of the decade. &quot;Complicated&quot; also ranked at number 197 in &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. In an AOL Radio listener&#x27;s poll, &quot;Complicated&quot; was voted Lavigne&#x27;s sixth best song. As of 2023, &quot;Complicated&quot; ranks as Lavigne&#x27;s most popular song on several platforms, including Spotify and several other pop rock music list sites.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the song a B− and said &quot;Avril Lavigne&#x27;s not kidding about that title, she&#x27;s the epitome of the blossoming anti-Britney movement&quot;. Christina Saraceno of AllMusic described &quot;Complicated&quot; as &quot;a gem of a pop/rock tune with a killer chorus&quot; and noted similarities between it and Pink&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Get Me&quot;. Saraceno highlighted the song as a &quot;track pick&quot; in a review of the album, &quot;Let Go&quot;.

On a more negative note, Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant&quot; magazine described &#x27;Complicated&#x27; as &quot;infectious&quot; and &quot;more poser than punk&quot;. In a review of Lavigne&#x27;s second album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that &quot;&#x27;Complicated&#x27; felt like strung-together bits of Morissette songs&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Complicated&quot; peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and stayed for 31 weeks on the chart. It was Lavigne&#x27;s longest charting song on the chart. &quot;Complicated&quot; peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 Airplay and Mainstream Top 40 Airplay charts, number 13 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and number 30 on the US Rhythmic chart. The single was certified 3× platinum in the United States with 3 million copies sold, making it the best selling debut single by a female Canadian singer. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it at number 83 of the &#x27;Top 100 Singles of the Decade&#x27;.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Complicated&quot; peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and was certified 2× platinum with more than 1,200,000 copies sold and streamed. In Canada, the single peaked at number 21 on the Canadian Singles Chart and was the fourth-most-played song on Canadian radio in 2002, as well as the most-played song of the year by a native artist. In New Zealand, the single peaked at number one for 9 consecutive weeks on the RIANZ Singles Chart and was certified platinum with 10,000 copies sold. &quot;Complicated&quot; also peaked and debuted at number one in Australia, Ireland, and Norway; number two in Austria, Denmark, Europe, Hungary, Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, and Switzerland; and number three in Belgium, Germany, and Poland. It was certified 2× platinum in Australia with 140,000 copies sold, and gold in Denmark with 45,000 copies sold. &quot;Complicated&quot; was certified gold in Austria, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, and platinum in Brazil and Norway.

==Music video==

The video, directed by the Malloys, starts with Lavigne asking her bandmates if they want to &quot;crash&quot; the mall. They respond with enthusiasm and skateboard there. The video features Lavigne and the band harassing shoppers and employees, generally causing havoc around the mall; for example, Lavigne watches her bandmates try on humorous clothing, shown as Lavigne sings the line &quot;You come over unannounced, dressed up like you&#x27;re something else&quot;.

This is intercut with footage of Lavigne performing the song at a skatepark while playing the guitar, with her band performing with her. People can be seen skateboarding around Lavigne as she and her band perform the song. As the line &quot;You fall and you crawl...&quot; is sung, a skateboarder can be seen falling over.

The video was shot at Eagle Rock Plaza, Los Angeles, in two days. During the shooting, the mall remained open. The video for &quot;Complicated&quot; was shot 4–5 March 2002 in L.A. The music video was released in April 2002.

As of June 2023, the video has over 600 million views on YouTube.

The music video was ranked at number 41 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century.

==Accolades==
Lavigne won Best New Artist in a Video at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards for &quot;Complicated&quot;. &quot;Complicated&quot; won in the Single of the Year category at the 2003 Juno Awards. In the United States, the song was nominated at the 2003 Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Song of the Year; it lost both awards to Norah Jones&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot;. In Brazil, it was nominated in the category of best international video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Brazil. In April 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the track at number two on their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Minivan Rock Songs&quot;.

Olivia O&#x27;Brien released a cover of &quot;Complicated&quot; in 2015. She performed the song during the Olivia O&#x27;Brien Show tour in 2021. In 2023, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied the song as &quot;A Complicated Song&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;.

In the anime &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot;, the episode &quot;Scott 2 Pilgrim&quot; features Kieran Culkin (who voiced Wallace Wells) randomly and abruptly covering the song to a news reporter. &quot;Vulture&quot; called the moment &quot;a perfect Canadian &#x27;00s pop-rock reference.&quot;

<text>David John Conner, (born 6 April 1947) is a British Anglican bishop. He served as Dean of Windsor from 1998 to 2023, and was additionally the Bishop to the Forces between 2001 and 2009. He previously served as Bishop of Lynn, a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Norwich, from 1994 to 1998, and in school chaplaincy. Conner retired effective 31 July 2023.

==Biography==
Conner is the son of William Ernest Conner and Joan Millington Conner. He was educated at Erith Grammar School, then Exeter College, Oxford and St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford. He was ordained as deacon on 29 June 1971 by Christopher Pepys, Bishop of Buckingham at St Martin&#x27;s, Fenny Stratford. Having also spent a year at the Oxford Department of Education, soon after ordination he moved into chaplaincy at St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford (where he was ordained priest in 1972 by Kenneth Woollcombe, Bishop of Oxford, in the School Chapel) from 1971 to 1980, and later at Winchester. For a while, he was an examining chaplain to the Bishop of Winchester. From 1987 to 1994 he was Vicar of Great St Mary&#x27;s the University Church, Cambridge. He served as Bishop of Lynn from 1994 to 1998, in which year he was appointed Dean of Windsor; in this role, Conner also held the post of Register of the Order of the Garter and was a domestic chaplain to Elizabeth II. From 2001 to 2009 he was also Bishop to the Forces. He was consecrated as bishop on 2 February 1994 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury. His installation at Windsor on 7 December 1998 was attended by Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; he later presided over both of their interments in the King George VI Memorial Chapel on 19 September 2022, after the Queen&#x27;s committal ceremony.

For many years Conner has been closely involved with the selection of candidates for ordination and with the inspection of theological colleges, courses and schemes. He has been governor of a number of schools and colleges. He is an honorary fellow of Girton College, Cambridge.

==Honours==
Conner was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2010 New Year Honours. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) on 19 July 2023 ahead of relinquishing the post of Dean of Windsor.

He took part in the Royal Procession at the 2023 Coronation, not long before his 31 July 2023 retirement.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Conner married Jayne Maria Evans; they have two sons.

<doc id="700795" wikidata="Q834275" url="?curid=700795" title="I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)">
<text>&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne from her debut studio album &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002). It was released to radio as the third single from the album on November 18, 2002, by Arista Records. The song was written by Lavigne and the production team the Matrix, who solely helmed its production. According to Lavigne, the song was inspired by feelings of loneliness she experienced over being single.

The song reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top 10 in nine other countries, including Ireland, Italy, and New Zealand, peaking within the top five in these regions. In the US, the song topped two &quot;Billboard&quot; listings: the Adult Top 40 and the Mainstream Top 40. &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; received radio and television airplay in Australia, but it was not officially released there. The track was nominated for several awards following its release, winning two ASCAP Awards, a BMI Pop Music Award, and a SOCAN Award. It was the second Lavigne song to be nominated for a Grammy in the categories Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Background and composition==
&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was written by Lavigne and the production team the Matrix. According to Lavigne, the song was written when she was having a &quot;depressing day&quot; due to feelings of loneliness over being single.

&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; is a rock song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of A major and is set in a time signature. Lavigne&#x27;s vocal range spans two octaves, from A3 to E5.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; senior editor Chuck Taylor referred to the song as a &quot;beautifully performed, musically sophisticated outing that showcases a surprisingly emotional vocal from [Lavigne].&quot; He further praised the song&#x27;s universal appeal, believing that its theme relates well to both teenagers and adults. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the song as &quot;sweet.&quot; Jamieson Cox of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the song as a power ballad and compared it to B-sides released by American rock band Aerosmith in the late Nineties.

The arrangement of singles from &quot;Let Go&quot;, with &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; as the third, was regarded as &quot;controversial choices&quot;, given that &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was &quot;thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album&quot;, and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, &quot;Some people just really didn&#x27;t get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it&#x27;s so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.&quot; &quot;KidsWorld&quot; called it &quot;the perfect song to drown your sorrows to when that guy from your class breaks your heart.&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; became Lavigne&#x27;s third top 10 song when it peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2003 during its ninth week on the chart. The song spent 10 consecutive weeks on the top 10 and 27 weeks on the Hot 100 making it Lavigne&#x27;s second-longest staying song on this chart, surpassed by her debut single &quot;Complicated&quot; which stayed on the chart for 31 weeks. &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; ranked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2003 and number 13 on the Canadian Singles Chart. The song was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America in 2006 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. As of July 2013, &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; had sold 556,000 digital copies in the US. As a double A-side DVD single, the &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;/&quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; video single was certified gold and platinum in 2003.

In United Kingdom, &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was released on March 31, 2003. The song debuted and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart in 2003, becoming her third top 10 single on the chart; the song re-entered in UK Singles Chart in the week of December 17, 2011, in number 58. It debuted at number six and peaked at number five in Ireland, staying in the top 10 for six weeks. &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; reached top five in New Zealand; top 10 in Belgium and the Netherlands; top 20 in Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Norway and Denmark as well as reaching the top 40 in France. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart on December 10, 2011, at number 58, almost 10 years after the song first charted.

==Music video==
===Background===
The music video was directed by David LaChapelle in Los Angeles, California. Filmed in November 2002, most of the video is shown in slow motion but Lavigne&#x27;s mouth movements are in sync with the song&#x27;s vocals. This was achieved by recording the footage while the song was played twice as fast. It was at least partly filmed in Los Angeles with the street shots were filmed on Broadway, and the Orpheum Theatre is seen, with the snow banks CGI&#x27;d in.

===Synopsis and reception===

The video depicts Lavigne, who is seen alone, trying to find someone, whilst her band members play the song alone in the streets. Showing her originally at a party, the video also sees Lavigne pushing a guy when he tries to get with her straight after making out with another woman. The video also sees Lavigne walking on the streets and wearing a black jacket. Through the video, she is seen standing behind a snowy bank. At the end of the video, Lavigne walks out of the club with her coat on, kicks out the door and walks away.

Much Music named the video one of the &quot;Top 100 Best Videos of All Time&quot;. The music video was originally meant to end with Lavigne walking out of the club to her bandmates, who then greet her and walk off together into the distance, but this ending was removed during post-production, ending the video with her leaving alone. An alternative version of the video leaked online to the internet, comprising alternate shots, slightly longer sequences and featuring the originally filmed ending.

==Accolades==
&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance but lost to Luther Vandross&#x27;s &quot;Dance with My Father&quot; and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful&quot; respectively.

==In media, covers and samples==
&quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was later featured in the season 3 &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Tormented Mentor&quot;, in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Accelerate&quot; and in the movie &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. The song was also used in the 2003 Brazilian soap opera &quot;Mulheres Apaixonadas&quot;. Furthermore, it was featured in the video game &quot;Karaoke Revolution Volume 2&quot; and in &quot;Singstar&quot; Rock Ballads. The song is also used as the background music for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G85/G80 commercial, with Jennifer Garner and Cate Blanchett.
The song was used also in the end of the pilot of the Tarzan. 

Rihanna sampled the song on her track &quot;Cheers (Drink to That)&quot;, which was released as a single. Lavigne made an appearance in the music video. Polish-Czech singer Ewa Farna covered the song and it was featured as a track on her album &quot;Měls mě vůbec rád&quot;.

Sophie Evans covered the song in Week 3 of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. A year later, Amelia Lily covered the song in Week 9 of series 8 of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

British singer Yungblud covered the song as part of his segment for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s annual Live lounge month. He mashed-up the song with Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Cardigan&quot; (2020), accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar, joined by a cellist and two violinists, resulting in a cheerful, strings-laden performance. Both artists responded to the medley affirmatively.

Scottish synth-pop band Chvrches covered the song in their Apple Music Home Session, released on September 24, 2021.

&quot;I&#x27;m With You&quot; was featured in the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, as well as appearing on the official soundtrack for the film.

<text>David Conner (1792 – 20 March 1856) was an officer and commodore of the United States Navy. He served in the War of 1812 and led the Home Squadron during the Mexican–American War. He led the successful naval assault during the siege of Veracruz which included the landing of 10,000 U.S. troops, the largest U.S. military amphibious assault at the time. He served on the Board of Navy Commissioners; as the first Chief of the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repair; as a Special Diplomatic Agent to Mexico and commanded the Philadelphia Naval Yard.

==Early life==
Conner was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was the son of David Conner, an Irishman. He worked in Philadelphia and then joined the U.S. Navy on 16 January 1809. He served his first few years as a midshipman on the frigate .

==Military career==
During the War of 1812 Conner served in during her chase of HMS &quot;Belvidera&quot; and her actions with in February 1813 and the March 1815 capture of . During the capture of the &quot;Penguin&quot; he was severely wounded in the hip and his recovery took almost two years. He was held as a prisoner of war by the British. He received promotion to Lieutenant in July 1813.

In the decade following the war, Lieutenant Conner served in the Pacific, had shore duty at Philadelphia and commanded the schooner . Attaining the rank of Commander in March 1825, he was Commanding Officer of the sloops of war and before receiving promotion to Captain in 1835.

He served as a Navy Commissioner in 1841 and 1842, and upon the establishment of the bureau system in the Navy became the first Chief of the Bureau of Construction, Equipment, and Repair.

Conner was given the title Commodore, but his official naval rank remained unchanged. The title &quot;commodore&quot; added nothing to his pay or to his permanent rank of captain. Not until 1862, six years after Conner&#x27;s death in 1856, did the title commodore come to signify a higher grade or an increased salary.

During the Mexican–American War, Commodore Conner commanded the Home Squadron which operated in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846 and 1847. He successfully disrupted Mexican trade in the Gulf of Mexico with the Blockade of Veracruz. He attempted an operation up the Alvarado River but had to withdraw due to the lack of shallow draft vessels. On November 14, 1846, he captured Tampico as a base for future operations. He also participated in the naval assault against the city of Veracruz. Conner directed the naval assault and landing of 10,000 U.S. troops which was the largest amphibious assault by the U.S. to date. Conner fell ill toward the end of the siege of Veracruz and was replaced by his vice commander Matthew C. Perry.
Leaving seagoing service soon afterwards, Conner was assigned as Special Diplomatic Agent to Mexico by President Polk and subsequently commanded the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Ill health, however, kept him from seeing much other active employment. Commodore Conner died at Philadelphia on 20 March 1856 at age 64 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Two destroyers of the United States Navy have been named in his honor. The USS Conner (DD-72) was a Caldwell-class destroyer in service from 1918 to 1940 and the USS Conner (DD-582) was a Fletcher-class destroyer in service from 1943 to 1946.

<doc id="700800" wikidata="Q1987158" url="?curid=700800" title="Don't Tell Me (Madonna song)">
<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her eighth studio album &quot;Music&quot; (2000). Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the track with Mirwais Ahmadzaï, with additional writing from her brother-in-law, Joe Henry. Henry originally conceived it as a tango-styled torch song called &quot;Stop&quot;; the demo was later sent to Madonna, who then proceeded to change its musical composition, turning it into a country-dance song. Lyrically, Madonna asks her lover not to control her. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Music&quot; on November 13, 2000, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, who cited the song as one of the album&#x27;s standouts and praised Madonna&#x27;s vocals. It was also compared to the work of singer Sheryl Crow. The song attained commercial success, reaching the top of the record charts in Canada, Italy and New Zealand, as well as the top five in several regions. It also became Europe&#x27;s biggest radio hit of 2001. In the United States, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, tying her with the Beatles as the artist with the second-most top-ten singles in the Hot 100 history.

The music video was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino and features Madonna as a cowgirl walking down an automated treadmill in front of a projection screen, with cowboys dancing and straddling horses in the backdrop. The clip received two nominations at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, while also being nominated for a Grammy Award. The song was included in three of Madonna&#x27;s concert tours: Drowned World (2001), Re-Invention (2004), and Celebration (2023—2024). In 2014, Madonna appeared on Miley Cyrus&#x27; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special and performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; in a mashup with Cyrus&#x27; 2013 song &quot;We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;. Two years later, she performed the song on her show, in Melbourne and Miami.

==Background and release==

After the critical and commercial success of her seventh studio album, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998), Madonna had intended to embark on a concert tour in late 1999, but due to the delay of her film, &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (2000), the tour was cancelled. The singer also became pregnant with her son Rocco, from her relationship with director Guy Ritchie. Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, &quot;Music&quot;. She worked with French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï on the album, describing it as consisting of &quot;Funky, electronic music blended with futuristic folk. Lots of jangly guitars and moody melancholic lines&quot;.

Following the success of the lead single, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was released as the second single from the album on November 21, 2000, by Maverick Records. A number of remixes for the song were created by Thunderpuss, Richard &quot;Humpty&quot; Vission and Tracy Young. Warner Bros. Records released various renditions on CD, cassette, maxi, 7-inch and 12-inch singles. The Thunderpuss Club Mix had a more house-inspired sound, with spiraling synth pads and keyboard effects. The filtered beats and tweaked keyboard riffs of Humpty Vission&#x27;s Radio Mix gave Madonna&#x27;s voice an &quot;underwater&quot; effect, while Young&#x27;s remix featured a violin breakdown and sonic elements that reminisce Blondie&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jose F. Promis praised the remixes for &quot;transform(ing) the country-infused track into an awesome dance extravaganza&quot;.

==Recording and composition==
Madonna co-wrote and co-produced &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; with Ahmadzaï, and her brother-in-law Joe Henry, who is credited as an additional songwriter. Henry had written a tango-styled song titled &quot;Stop&quot;, which featured jazz saxophone player Ornette Coleman and Henry singing in &quot;Tom Waits-inspired&quot; vocals; it was eventually included on the latter&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Scar&quot; (2001). After Henry played the demo for &quot;Stop&quot; to his wife, Madonna&#x27;s sister Melanie, she sent the track to Madonna. The singer liked the demo and was drawn to the song&#x27;s lyrics, its &quot;sentiment of defiance, the attitude of it&quot;, but did not prefer its musical tone, since it was not in-line with the compositions for &quot;Music&quot;. Madonna worked with Ahmadzaï and changed the original string arrangement into a stop-time, acoustic guitar and keyboard composition. She recorded it at Ahmadzaï&#x27;s studio, accompanied by a Martin D-28 guitar to which Ahmadzaï added a stutter effect. Madonna preferred the sound effect over the final melody. Ahmadzaï also played the acoustic guitar and keyboards on the track. Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent mixed the song and Michel Colombier played the strings.
According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with the singer&#x27;s vocals ranging from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. The song follows a basic sequence of D–Am–C–G as its chord progression. Ben Greenbank from &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; described the track as a &quot;country meets dance&quot; song with trip hop beats, accompanied by acoustic guitar riffs. Chuck Arnold of &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; as a &quot;twangy trip-hop&quot; track. While, &quot;Billboard&quot; &#x27;s Jason Lipshutz said its production &quot;served as an act of twangy defiance — with clipped vocals, guitar loops, strings and a mainstream take on folktronica&quot;. The song begins with a &quot;plucked&quot; guitar riff in a jagged stop/start beat, with the arpeggios reminiscent of country music. Every fourth beat is followed by a small silence that eventually builds into the chorus.

Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, described the track as an &quot;electronica meets country rock&quot; song based on a single four-chord sequence, disguised by the mixing. He found that Madonna&#x27;s expressive lead vocals were double tracked. The strings appeared towards the end with the looping sounds continuing and ultimately fading. According to author Carol Vernallis, the contradictory guitar stops interspersed with the digital electronic sounds made the song sound &quot;authentic&quot; in its portrayal of the country-western genre of music. When asked about the differences between his demo and Madonna&#x27;s song, Henry pointed out that it was the groove which was important. Lyrically, Madonna urges her lover in the song to stop controlling her actions and feelings; she compares the lyrics to the work of Frank Sinatra. She conjures up unnatural imagery through the lyrics by singing &quot;Tell the bed not to lay / Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah / Not to stare up at me / Like a calf down on its knees&quot;.

==Critical response==

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a positive review of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, describing it as an &quot;intricate, sensual, folk-psych stunner&quot;. Jim Farber from &quot;Daily News&quot; felt that &quot;[the song] crosses up-to-date electronica with rootsy American blues via a guitar hook that sounds something like Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &#x27;Sweet Home Alabama&#x27;&quot;. He also believed that the imagery conjured up in the song is predominantly American. A reviewer for &quot;NME&quot; considered &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; an &quot;alt-alt-country, hacked-up acoustic guitar over knife-sharp beats track&quot;, comparing Madonna to Sheryl Crow. Danny Eccleston from &quot;Q&quot;, also saw similarities to Crow, calling the track &quot;&quot;Music&quot;″s closest cousin to the sonic landscapes of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;&quot;, while also pointing out its &quot;masterful ending – as a rhythm of insectoid whirrs and bendy ARP-style &#x27;wowp!&#x27;s join the guitar while Colombier&#x27;s strings ape the peal of church bells&quot;. &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Justin Harp felt that &quot;the comparisons [to Sheryl Crow] actually did a disservice to a track that stands out as particularly unique in Madonna&#x27;s massive catalogue of hits&quot;. Louis Virtel, from The Backlot, placed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; at number 25 of his list &quot;The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs&quot;; he praised the singer for &quot;invoking some tried-and-true country music imagery&quot; and called it an &quot;unmistakable radio moment of the early 2000s&quot;.

Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;the album’s most indelible song and one of Madonna’s best-ever singles&quot;. Samuel R. Murrian from &quot;Parade&quot; wrote that &quot;Madonna’s defiant, rebellious personality that we love is on full-blast in this extremely clever and infectious song&quot;. While ranking Madonna&#x27;s singles in honor of her 60th birthday, Jude Rogers from &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed the track at number 32, calling it &quot;brilliantly strange&quot; and praising its catchiness. Jon O&#x27;Brien from &quot;Paste&quot; magazine complimented the track&#x27;s production, and believed it to be an &quot;immediate standout&quot; on the album. The mix of the guitar riffs, the fractured beats and Colombier&#x27;s string arrangement were all listed as an &quot;elegiac finale&quot; complementing the cowboy imagery portrayed by Madonna during the album cycle. Similar thoughts were registered by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s Matthew Jacobs who ranked it at number 21 of his list &quot;The Definitive Ranking of Madonna Singles&quot;. In his review of the &quot;Music&quot; album, Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; felt that Madonna revealed more of her soul in the track. Cinquemani further opined that &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was perceived to be an &quot;unlikely&quot; follow-up to &quot;Music&quot;, with its &quot;atypical structure and peculiar lyrics [...] [that] made it an unlikely hit to boot. But a hit is exactly what it was [...]&quot;, awarding the track a B+.

For Medium&#x27;s Richard LaBeau, &quot;this fascinating merge of country and dance ranks high among the most unique songs of her career&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Larry Flick called &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; a &quot;thoughtful, often poetic gem&quot; that features &quot;one of Madonna&#x27;s most soulful vocal deliveries&quot;. In August 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; picked it as the singer&#x27;s 20th greatest single; &quot;a mix of poetically off-center lyrics. a CD-skip stutter effect and that jangly guitar riff, [&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;] would’ve ended up a mess for many artists. But for Madonna, it landed her yet another top five Hot 100 hit&quot;. Author Alejandro L. Madrid felt the song had elements of Nortec music. Steven Humphrey, from &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot;, hailed it as &quot;a freaking great song. (Perhaps the last great song of [Madonna&#x27;s] career?) A stuttering combo of trip-hop and hillbilly folk, Madonna&#x27;s soulful croon perfectly expresses the longing of a gal telling her beau to stop controlling how she feels&quot;. A negative review came from Cynthia Fuchs of &quot;PopMatters&quot; who wrote that the song &quot;is another near miss, with admirable attitude but, well, laughable lyrics&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Chuck Arnold listed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; as Madonna&#x27;s 28th best single, writing that &quot;with its acoustic guitar, country stomp, and stop-start trippiness, [&#x27;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&#x27;] succeeds against the odds&quot;. From &quot;Gay Star News&quot;, Joe Morgan wrote: &quot;Lyrics don’t make a lot of sense, but that doesn’t matter. This is unique, country-electronic pop&quot;.

==Chart performance==

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; debuted at number 78 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, the week of December 9, 2000. Two weeks later it reached the top-40 of the chart at number 35. In February 2001, after its commercial release, the single climbed from number 16 to number four, giving Madonna her 34th top-ten single on the Hot 100. This achievement tied Madonna with the Beatles for second most top-ten singles and put her within reach of Elvis Presley&#x27;s record of 36 top-ten hits. She later surpassed the record with her 2008 single &quot;4 Minutes&quot;, thus becoming the artist with most top-ten singles in &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 history. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; at number 26 on their list of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s 40 Biggest Hits&quot; on the Hot 100.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was also successful on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart, being present on the chart for 14 weeks. It outlasted &quot;Music&quot; and tied with &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; (1995) as Madonna&#x27;s longest running song on the chart at the time. The track was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2001, for shipments of 500,000 copies, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 24th Gold-certified single and tying her with the Beatles for the second-most gold records in the United States. In Canada, the song debuted at number 13 on the Canadian Singles Chart the week of January 27, 2001, and reached the first spot the week of February 17, where it remained for one week. It was Madonna&#x27;s 20th number-one Canadian single.

In Australia, the song debuted at number eight, and next week reached a peak of number seven on the Australian Singles Chart, staying for a total of 17 weeks. In 2002, it obtained a Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 70,000 copies of the single. The song was also successful in New Zealand, where it became Madonna&#x27;s fifth and second consecutive number-one following &quot;Music&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; debuted at number 65 on the UK Singles Chart on December 9, 2000. After a total of 10 weeks on the chart, it peaked at number 4 on February 10, 2001, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 12th consecutive top-ten single. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 185,000 copies there. In 2017, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for equivalent sales of 200,000 copies. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was also successful across Europe: in Italy, it peaked at number one on the FIMI Singles Chart, while reaching the top-ten in Finland, Norway, Poland, Scotland and Spain. Across Europe, the song peaked at number two on the European Hot 100 Singles chart . It also topped the European Top 50 Radio for nine consecutive weeks and eventually became the continent&#x27;s number-one radio song of 2001.

==Music video==
===Background and synopsis===

The music video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was directed by long-time collaborator Jean-Baptiste Mondino and was filmed in Los Angeles on October 17, 2000, with Jamie King in charge of the choreography. King described the filming process: &quot;[Mondino] really doesn&#x27;t write a treatment so much. He may have an idea and Madonna and I really have lots of ideas and then I usually come up with a treatment style thing that he ends up executing and Madonna agrees to it. It&#x27;s just a really great collaboration&quot;. The wardrobe was created by DSquared2 and longtime Madonna collaborator Arianne Phillips. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Phillips cited &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; as one of her favorite Madonna style moments, saying that working with the singer is both rewarding and challenging.

The video begins with Madonna—dressed in a blue plaid flannel shirt, dirty jeans, a large buckled belt and boots—walking on a desert highway faced towards the viewer. The camera zooms out to reveal that the highway in the background is actually a projection on a drive-in style backdrop and that Madonna is walking on a treadmill. Her walking freezes simultaneously with the song&#x27;s silent dropouts. The clip then alternates between scenes of Madonna dancing by herself on the treadmill, playing with sand in a desert, and cowboys line dancing in the video backdrop. Later, the cowboys join the singer in a choreographed dance routine, with Madonna wearing a black western-style jacket, cowboy hat and suede chaps. Towards the end Madonna is seen riding a mechanical bull, while the final scene depicts a cowboy riding a Skewbald horse in slow motion, getting thrown to the ground and getting up again.

===Reception and analysis===
The &quot;New York Daily News&quot;″ Jim Farber praised the choreography presented in the video, writing that it &quot;lives up to the beauty of &#x27;Open Your Heart&#x27;, spiced with the zip of the peppiest new Gap ads&quot;. Steven Humphrey from &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot;, felt that the video departed from Mondino and Madonna&#x27;s previous collaborations due to the following reasons: &quot;[Madonna] is treated more like a set-piece [...] she&#x27;s just there—not overtly sexual, not trying to prove any point, just there&quot;. Humphrey found references of Monidno&#x27;s earlier work in the clip for &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, including the &quot;topsy-turvy projections and a placid, near-emotionless narrator&quot; he displayed in singer Don Henley&#x27;s music video for &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; (1984). &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Justin Harp felt that &quot;the sight of Madonna wearing a cowboy hat and line dancing in the [video] still ranks as one of the iconic visuals from her four-decade career&quot;. Author Judith Periano wrote in her book &quot;Listening to the Sirens: Musical Technologies of Queer Identity from Homer to Hedwig&quot; that the video was comparable to the clip for Judy Garland&#x27;s &quot;Get Happy&quot;. Samuel R. Murrian opined that it &quot;revolutionized cowboy chic&quot;.

Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, questioned whether the singer&#x27;s portrayal of Western culture in the video was legitimate or if it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, also criticizing the dancing cowboys. Farber added that &quot;by putting her cowboys on a commercial billboard, [Madonna] not only acknowledges the absurdity of her playing a rural lass, she&#x27;s implicitly questioning whether there&#x27;s any difference left between authenticity and fakery in a media-driven world&quot;. According to Amy Herzog, the video inverts the traditional male gaze by directing it onto the fallen cowboy at the end — the subversion being a recurrent theme in Madonna&#x27;s work from her music videos of the 1980s.

During the 2001 MTV Movie Awards, hosts Kirsten Dunst and Jimmy Fallon parodied both the video and Madonna&#x27;s cowgirl look. At one point, Fallon even dropped to the floor to cover himself in sand. The song &quot;Do it With Madonna&quot; by Australian rock band The Androids referenced the music video in the line &quot;Have you seen her where she&#x27;s wearing the cowboy hat and she&#x27;s kicking the dirt?&quot;. In 2015, television show host Ellen DeGeneres re-created the video by superimposing herself as one of Madonna&#x27;s cowboys. At the 10th annual Music Video Production Association Awards, which took place on May 16, 2001, the video won two awards: in the categories of Video of the year and Best direction for a female artist. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 44th ceremony and for Best Female Video and Best Choreography at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, the video was included on Madonna&#x27;s compilation, &quot;&quot;.

==Live performances==

On November 3, 2000, Madonna appeared on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, her first time on the show since her controversial appearance in 1994. She performed a slow version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on acoustic guitar; this marked the first time the singer played guitar in public. Dressed in a black bedazzled cowboy shirt and jeans, she was joined by Monte Pittman. Shortly afterwards, she traveled to Europe to promote &quot;Music&quot; and performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on German TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. On November 24, she appeared on British television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and performed both &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;. Both songs were also performed during Madonna&#x27;s visit to French television program &quot;Nulle Part Ailleurs&quot; that same week, as well as on Italian show &quot;Carràmba! Che fortuna&quot;. The song was also performed on the promotional concerts for &quot;Music&quot;, on November 5, 2000, at New York City&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom, and on November 29 at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy. During the performance Madonna sat on a bale of hay while Ahmadzaï played guitar. Her wardrobe consisted of a black tank top with the name Britney Spears written on it, cowboy hat and boots. For the London performance, Madonna wore a different t-shirt, with the names of her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes printed on it.

On the Drowned World Tour (2001), Madonna performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; as the second song of the Western-themed third act. Dressed as a cowgirl in a black jacket, stars and stripes blouse, a raccoon&#x27;s tail as an accessory, cowboy hat and mud encrusted jeans with chaps, Madonna reenacted the song&#x27;s music video with her dancers dressed as cowboys and did a line dance. Phill Gallo from &quot;Variety&quot;, was impressed with the number, pointing out that it was the tour&#x27;s first to feature the singer and her dancers doing collective choreography. The performance on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot;. On May 9, 2003, Madonna performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; at London&#x27;s HMV Oxford Circus while promoting her ninth studio album &quot;American Life&quot;. During the Re-Invention World Tour (2004), Madonna performed a &quot;funked-up&quot; version of the song, which was included on the show&#x27;s acoustic themed third act. She was decked in a black Stella McCartney suit with matching hat and again enacted the video&#x27;s choreography with her dancers. The performance featured a French skyline as backdrop and sampled The Verve&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; (1997).
On January 29, 2014, Madonna made a surprise appearance at singer Miley Cyrus&#x27; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; special, and performed a mashup of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; with Cyrus&#x27; 2013 song &quot;We Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;. Both singers were dressed in rhinestone cowboy outfits. They sang and finished each other&#x27;s verses while bumping and grinding. Matthew Jacobs from &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, wrote that &quot;even if the vocals got a little shoddy toward the mashup&#x27;s end – [Cyrus and Madonna] staged an impressive collaboration that didn&#x27;t rely on the amplified production values associated with their typical performances&quot;. While on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), Madonna performed impromptu versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; on the Amsterdam, Antwerp and Turin stops. In March 2016, the song was included on the Melbourne stop of Madonna&#x27;s show. She performed the song following a monologue aimed at an attendee who asked her why she was still performing into her mid-to-late 50s. On December, she repeated the performance at the Miami stop, which took place in the city&#x27;s Faena Forum. One month earlier, she performed it during an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park in support of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was included on the Celebration Tour (2023—2024), where it was given a cowboy theme. Madonna donned a leather corset, a cowboy hat created by Ruslan Baginskiy, and custom-made knee-high Miu Miu steel-toe boots. During the number –which included line dancing– she was joined by one of her twin daughters, and guest star Bob the Drag Queen dressed as a rodeo clown. The performance ended with the singer engaging in a mock shootout with Bob. &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was named one of the best moments of the concert by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch.

<text>Christopher Lee RD (13 October 1941 – 14 February 2021) was a British writer, historian and broadcaster, best known for writing the radio documentary series &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot; for the BBC read by Anna Massey and directed by Pete Atkin.

==Career==
Lee&#x27;s career began after expulsion from school and going to sea in an old tramp steamer.

In his twenties he restarted education, reading history at London University. He later joined the BBC as a defence and foreign affairs correspondent and was posted to Moscow and the Middle East. Leaving his career in journalism for academia, Lee was the first Quatercentenary Fellow in Contemporary History and Gomes Lecturer in Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He went on to research the history of ideas at Birkbeck College in the University of London.

Christopher Lee was recruited into the Royal Navy&#x27;s Joint Intelligence Reserve Branch and in the 1970s completed a study of the Order of Battle of the Soviet Northern Fleet and its command structure. Promoted to commander, he later became captain of based at Chatham in Kent and was awarded a bar to his Reserve Decoration.

==&quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;==
Lee is the originator and writer of the BBC Radio 4 trilogy &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;, first broadcast in June 1995. It recounts, in 216 episodes each 15 minutes long (46 hours total), the history of Britain from the Romans to the death of Queen Victoria, the 20th century and the British Empire. The series was read by Anna Massey and included extracts from the book &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot; written by Sir Winston Churchill, interwoven into Lee&#x27;s own account of the history. The extracts were read by Paul Eddington, who died during the production, and his role was completed by Peter Jeffrey.

In 1999 the BBC and Christopher Lee extended the programme to cover the 20th century: from 1901, where the original series had ended, to the end of the millennium. Anna Massey was retained as the narrator but quotations were read by Robert Powell. In 2001 another shorter series entitled &quot;This Sceptred Isle: Dynasties&quot; was produced, telling the stories of the powerful and influential families of Britain and Ireland, including the Godwines, the Despensers and the Churchills. Then, over the course of several months in 2005 and 2006 came &quot;This Sceptred Isle: Empire&quot;, a 90-part history of the British Empire narrated by Juliet Stevenson.

There are three accompanying books of &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot;.

==Other projects==
Lee&#x27;s book &quot;1603&quot; (2003) is the history of the death of Elizabeth I and the arrival of the Stuarts. &quot;Nelson and Napoleon&quot; (2005) described the events that led to the Battle of Trafalgar. The autobiographic &quot;Eight Bells and Top Masts&quot; (also 2005) is an account of his time as a deck boy and his circumnavigation of the globe and the &quot;Bath Detective&quot; thriller trilogy.

In 2006, he gave a &quot;Platform&quot; talk on history writing and teaching at the National Theatre as a prelude to Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;The History Boys&quot; and a new stage play set in the London of 1912. His study of the British monarchy and its future was published in spring 2014 and his book on Royal Ceremony and Regalia is to be published early 2015.

He is also the writer of more than 100 Radio 4 plays and series including, &quot;The House&quot; for Timothy West, Julian Glover and Isla Blair, &quot;Colvil &amp; Soames&quot; for Christopher Benjamin and Amanda Redman, &quot;Our Brave Boys&quot; for Martin Jarvis and Fiona Shaw and the Los Angeles production of his &quot;The Trial of Walter Ralegh&quot; which Rosalind Ayres produced with Michael York in the title role. His play, &quot;A Pattern in Shrouds&quot; was broadcast on Radio 4 in the summer of 2009 and deals with the consequences of the assassination of the Queen&#x27;s uncle, Lord Mountbatten in 1979. In 2013 the BBC ran his play &quot;Air Force One&quot; that questioned the events during the 90 minutes between the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and swearing in of Lyndon B Johnson aboard the presidential plane.

In 2011, Lee edited an official single-volume abridgement of Winston Churchill&#x27;s four-volume &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;. In 2013, the book &quot;Monarchy, Past, present…and future?&quot; was published. The authorised biography of Lord Carrington was issued in 2018, as was &quot;Viceroys: The Creation of the British&quot;, a history of the Viceroys of India, with illustrations by his wife.

Lee was the defence and foreign affairs adviser to the British Forces Broadcasting Service, where he appeared as presenter and contributor on the weekly military analysis programme &quot;Sitrep&quot; for 30 years. He also acted as lead analyst of the defence and foreign policy firm SceptredIsle Consulting.

==Personal life and death==
Lee divided his time between Sussex in England and Florence, Italy. He was married to Fiona Graham-Mackay, the portrait and landscape painter and skipper of their yacht &quot;Janeva&quot; moored on England&#x27;s east coast. He had two daughters and three grandchildren by his first wife.

Lee died on 14 February 2021, at his Sussex home, some time after being released from a hospital for an unspecified illness, where he contracted COVID-19 amid the COVID-19 pandemic in England. He was 79 years old.

<doc id="700804" wikidata="Q992883" url="?curid=700804" title="Sonoyta">
<text>Sonoyta, Sonora, is a town in the northern Mexican state of Sonora. It stands on the U.S.-Mexico border, facing Lukeville, Arizona, in the United States. It is the municipal seat of the municipality of Plutarco Elías Calles.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 census, the city had 12,849 inhabitants while the surrounding municipality had 15,652 inhabitants. There were 6,613 male inhabitants and 6,236 female. 96.1 percent of the population over five years of age are Roman Catholic, 3.0 percent are Evangelicals, and the remaining 0.9 percent belong to other religions.

==History==
The first inhabitants of this region were the Tohono O&#x27;odham, who lived in the regions of Pinacate, Quitovac, and Sonoyta. The arrival of Jesuit missionaries to this zone changed their way of life. Therefore, compact communities were formed mainly on the banks of lakes and of the river. At the foothills of a spot known as Loma Alta, sprouted water from a fountain, called by the naturals Ṣon Oidag, O&#x27;odham for &quot;base of the water&quot;. 

Jesuit missionary Eusebio Kino founded the mission Nuestra Senora de Loreto y San Marcelo de Sonoyta in 1699, and built its first church in 1701. Enrique Ruhen, another missionary, rebuilt the church in 1751; it was destroyed the same year in the Pima Revolt, and Ruhen was killed.

In 1836 they discovered adjoining mines. Sonoyta was dependent to the municipality of the District of Altar during periods of the 19th century. After the Revolution it belonged to the municipality of Caborca, Sonora, through the Law No. 136 of July 9, 1952. Then it separated from the municipality of Caborca and belonged to the municipality of Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, until August 1989, when a new municipality was created and called General Plutarco Elías Calles, as a social, political, and historic need.

For a long time, the border crossing was very busy with imports/exports, but after an internal change to customs laws in Mexico, import/export business dwindled. This led to heavy migration to other cities during the late 1980s to mid-1990s.

==Education==
The municipality has 10 preschools, 15 elementary schools, 5 junior high and high schools, 2 medium professional and 1 accredited college.

==Transportation==
Sonoyta is situated at an important crossroads. Federal Highway 2, which runs parallel to the international border, crosses here. Federal Highway 8 leading from Lukeville, Arizona (U.S.-Mexico border of Sonoyta) to Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, also crosses the city. It is connected to the United States by the Lukeville Port of Entry.

==Present day==
Sonoyta is well known as a crossing-point to the United States for illegal immigrants. Many immigrants use the town to make final preparations for a treacherous trek through the Sonoran Desert. On this long desert march, migrants often face death, especially during the summer season.

Conversely, the town is used as a crossover point for American tourists headed to Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, or other cities in Northern Mexico. Puerto Peñasco, a popular beach resort city, is located about southwest on Highway 8.

Sonoyta features many urban features, as well as a downtown with many small stores and markets. Services of major companies, such as Pemex, are available, and major airports are located in Mexicali, Baja California; Hermosillo, Sonora; Yuma, Arizona; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tucson, Arizona, all within five hours or less by car. Puerto Peñasco International Airport also serves Sonoyta residents since 2008, with flights to other points in Mexico.

The border between Sonoyta and Lukeville, Arizona, is open from 6:00 a.m. until 8:00pm MST.

<doc id="700805" wikidata="Q16985096" url="?curid=700805" title="Streamers (play)">
<text>Streamers is a play by David Rabe.

==Plot synopsis==
The last in his Vietnam War trilogy that began with &quot;The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel&quot; and &quot;Sticks and Bones&quot;, 
 it focuses on the interactions and personal conflicts of a group of soldiers preparing to ship out to fight in the Vietnam War in 1965. Among them are middle class African American Roger, upper class Manhattanite Richie, who is struggling with his sexual orientation, conservative Wisconsin country boy Billy, and fearful loose cannon Carlyle, a streetwise Black man. In charge of their barracks are abrasive alcoholic Sgt. Cokes, who already has served overseas, and aggressive Sgt. Rooney, who is anxious to get into combat.

==Background==
The title is a reference to parachutes that fail to open. &quot;Streamers&quot; originally was a one-act play entitled &quot;Knives&quot; Rabe completed in the late 1960s prior to writing the first two-thirds of his trilogy. While working as a journalist in New Haven, Connecticut, he expanded it into a full-length play. Under the direction of Mike Nichols, it premiered at the Long Wharf Theatre on January 30, 1976. The cast included Herbert Jefferson, Jr. as Roger, Peter Evans as Richie, John Heard as Billy, Joe Fields as Carlyle, Dolph Sweet as Cokes, and Kenneth McMillan as Rooney.

==Productions==
&quot;Streamers&quot; premiered at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in 1976. The play transferred to the Off-Broadway Lincoln Center Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater opening on April 21, 1976, and closing on June 5, 1977 after 478 performances. The cast included Terry Alexander as Roger, Paul Rudd as Billy and Dorian Harewood as Carlyle, with Evans, Sweet, and McMillian reprising their Long Wharf roles. Later in the run Mark Metcalf replaced Rudd as Billy.

===Revival===
&quot;Streamers&quot; was revived by the Roundabout Theatre Company. The play opened at the Off-Broadway Laura Pels Theatre on October 17, 2008 in previews, officially on November 11, in a limited engagement to January 11, 2009. This production was based on the one presented by the Huntington Theatre in 2007.

It was directed by Scott Ellis. The cast included J.D. Williams as Roger, Hale Appleman as Richie, Brad Fleischer as Billy, Atoh Essandoh as Carlyle, Larry Clarke as Sgt. Cokes, and John Sharian as Sgt. Rooney.

<text>Binyamin Ze&#x27;ev Kahane (; 3 October 1966 – 31 December 2000) was an American-Israeli Orthodox rabbi and the son of Rabbi Meir Kahane. He was assassinated by Palestinian militants in 2000. His wife, Talia, was also killed in the attack, leaving behind six young children.

== Life ==
Born in New York City, he emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of four, in 1971. He was a young Israeli Orthodox Jewish scholar and rabbi who was most famous for his leadership of Kahane Chai, a far-right political party that broke from his father&#x27;s Kach party after Meir Kahane&#x27;s assassination in 1990. He was convicted several times by Israeli courts for advocating violence against Arabs.

Kahane was the author of &quot;The Haggada of the Jewish Idea&quot;, a commentary based on his father&#x27;s teachings of the Passover Haggadah read at the Passover Seder. He wrote a Torah portion sheet called &quot;Darka Shel Torah&quot; (&quot;The Way of the Torah&quot;) that was distributed for the weekly Torah portions.

== Death ==
Kahane and his wife Talia were shot and killed near the Israeli settlement of Ofra on 31 December 2000. The ambush took place on road 60 about north of Jerusalem, just before the town of Ofra. Five of the couple&#x27;s six children were in the van when they were hit by automatic rifle fire. Binyamin (the driver) was killed, and the vehicle went out of control and smashed into a wall. His wife Talia died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital in Jerusalem. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office subsequently announced the arrest of three members of Force 17 – Talal Ghassan, Marzouk Abu Naim, and Na&#x27;man Nofel – who were believed to have carried out the attack under the instruction of PLO leader Col. Mahmoud Damra. However, in 2007, Khaled Shawish was arrested for the attack.

<text>The Academy for the Scholarly Research and Fostering of Germandom (&quot;die Akademie zur Wissenschaftlichen Erforschung und Pflege des Deutschtums&quot;), or German Academy (&quot;die Deutsche Akademie&quot;, ), was a German cultural institute founded in 1925 at Munich, under the Weimar Republic. Its founders included the geopolitician Karl Haushofer, who coined the political use of the term &quot;Lebensraum&quot; and strongly influenced Nazi ideology. Between 1939 and 1942, it was headed by Ludwig Siebert, a Nazi politician and the prime minister of Bavaria, and it became &quot;the most important organisation representing Nazi cultural policy&quot; abroad.

The Academy was banned under American occupation in 1945, and in 1951, the West German government replaced it with the present-day Goethe-Institut.

<text>Alcohol 120% is a disk image emulator and disc burning software for Microsoft Windows developed by Alcohol Soft. An edition named Alcohol 52% is also offered which lacks the burning engine. The software can create image files from a source CD/DVD/Blu-ray, as well as mount them in virtual drives, all in the proprietary Media Descriptor File format; images in this format consist of a pair of codice_1 and codice_2 files. 

==Features==
Alcohol 120%&#x27;s image recording feature is capable of bypassing certain copy protection schemes, such as SafeDisc, SecuROM, and Data Position Measurement (DPM). However, certain copy protection schemes require burner hardware that is capable of reproducing the copy protection. It can also create images of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 file systems. It lacks the ability to back up DVD titles encrypted with the Content Scramble System. Due to legal restrictions, Alcohol Soft has opted not to include this feature.

Some software manufacturers employ software blacklisting methods to prevent Alcohol 120% from copying their discs. Initially, users had to use third-party tools to counteract the blacklisting, such as Anti-blaxx, CureROM, and Y.A.S.U. Later, Alcohol 120% included its own &quot;Alcohol Cloaking Initiative for DRM&quot; (A.C.I.D) component.

Alcohol Soft has cited it will not be developing an image editor for Alcohol 120%.

The latest versions of Alcohol 120% comes with &quot;Alcohol Cloaking Initiative for DRM&quot; (A.C.I.D), which hides emulated drives from SecuROM 7 and SafeDisc 4.

=== Formats supported ===
Alcohol 120%&#x27;s image making tool supports the following formats:
*Media Descriptor File (default), consisting of a pair of codice_1 and codice_2
*ISO image (.iso)
It also supports burning in many formats.
== Other editions ==
* Alcohol 52% is a version of Alcohol 120% without the burning engine. It can still create image files, and mount those images on up to 31 virtual drives. There are two versions of Alcohol 52%, free and 30-day trial. The free version contains an optional adware toolbar bundled and is limited to 6 virtual drives.
* Alcohol 68% is a version of Alcohol 120% without media emulation capabilities, providing only the CD/DVD burning functions. It has since been discontinued and integrated into Alcohol 120%.
* Alcohol 120% Free Edition is a free for non-commercial use version of Alcohol 120% with certain limitations. These include only being able to burn to one drive at a time, only using up to two virtual drives and no copy protection emulation options.
* Alcohol 120% Retro Edition is a free version only for personal use on Windows 95/98/Me/XP (it cannot be run on Vista or later), allowing retrogamers to mount image files when using PCem or VMWare Workstation (DOSBox Pure cannot run it, because doing so will no doubt cause a crash). Li Wen&#x27;en (李文恩) talked about the issue with the developers; however, because many early programming tools were lost, debugging becomes very difficult, causing the problem may be quite time-consuming to fix or even be postponed.

<doc id="700816" wikidata="Q201707" url="?curid=700816" title="Baruch Marzel">
<text>Baruch Meir Marzel (, born 23 April 1959) is an Israeli politician and activist. He is an Orthodox Jew originally from Boston who now lives in the Jewish community of Hebron in Tel Rumeida with his wife and nine children. He was the leader of the far-right-oriented Jewish National Front party. He is now a member of Otzma Yehudit. He was the &quot;right-hand man&quot; of assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, acting as spokesman for the American-born rabbi&#x27;s Kach organization for ten years. The mainstream Israeli press has described him as an &quot;extreme right-wing activist&quot;.

== Biography ==
Marzel was born in 1959 in Boston, Massachusetts, and emigrated to Israel with his family when he was 6 weeks old, settling in Jerusalem&#x27;s Bayit Vegan neighbourhood. Although his father Shlomo was a respected educator who did not deal much with politics, Baruch joined Kahane&#x27;s Jewish Defense League at age 13. He gave up his US citizenship when he ran for the Knesset. He served in the IDF Armored Corps and fought in the 1982 Lebanon War, participating in battles along the Beirut-Damascus highway, after which he served in the United States as a representative for Sar-El. Marzel and his wife Sarah have nine children.

== Political activism ==

In 2004, he founded the Jewish National Front, and headed its Knesset list in the 2006 elections. During the election campaign, Marzel called on the Israeli military to &quot;carry out a targeted killing against (left-wing figure) Uri Avnery and his leftist collaborators&quot;. This came in reaction to Avnery earlier saying on Israeli radio station Kol Israel that the assassination of Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Zeevi was a Palestinian &quot;targeted killing&quot;, like the Israeli military&#x27;s &quot;targeted killings&quot; of Palestinian political leaders. According to Gush Shalom, &quot;the radio did not quote [Avnery&#x27;s] next words: &#x27;I am against all assassinations, both by Israelis and Palestinians.&#x27;&quot;

Marzel was considered too far-right for Israel&#x27;s hard-right parties, such as the National Union or the National Religious Party (today&#x27;s HaBayit HaYehudi party). Ultimately, the Jewish National Front received 24,824 votes (0.79%), less than half the minimum 2% required to enter the Knesset.

In 2009, after fellow party member Michael Ben-Ari won a seat in Knesset on the National Union (Israel) list, Marzel agreed to serve as Ben-Ari&#x27;s parliamentary aide. Marzel had originally planned to run independently. They eventually agreed not to submit their party&#x27;s list on their own, and instead placed Ben-Ari on the National Union party list. In 2013, Marzel ran for the Knesset again, this time on the third slot of the newly founded Otzma LeYisrael party, which splintered from National Union. However, the party failed to cross the electoral threshold. Prior to the election, other right-wing parties, such as the Jewish Home party, had rejected including or co-operating with Marzel, considering him to be too outspoken and too far-right.

Prior to the 2015 Israeli election, Marzel was put 4th on the Yachad-Otzma Yehudit technical bloc. Marzel&#x27;s inclusion came as a result of a compromise between the two parties, including the exclusion of Michael Ben-Ari and the inclusion of Marzel. In February 2015, the Election Committee disqualified Marzel, along with Arab MK Haneen Zoabi, from running in the election. The decision squeaked by with a 17 to 16 majority. The decision came after past attempts to block Marzel failed. The reasons given for the disqualification of Marzel were several statements attributed to him, which groups petitioning the move claimed qualified as &quot;racism&quot;. Following Marzel&#x27;s appeal, The Supreme Court accepted the appeals by both MK Haneen Zoabi and Marzel, against the decision of the Central Election Committee (CEC), which decided to disqualify them from participating in the next Knesset. In the end, the Yachad-Otzma bloc failed to pass the election threshold by a mere 11,000 votes, thus not entering the Knesset.

Marzel and Ben-Ari started the process in November 2022 of launching a new party that would be to the right of Otzma Yehudit.

He is a writer for the Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva.

== Legal issues ==
Baruch Marzel was first arrested by police at age 14. His first conviction followed three years later. According to a 2003 report in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, &quot;Marzel had acquired a police record of some 40 files before he was 30&quot;. The report goes on to detail his criminal record, including assaults on Palestinians (one earning him a 12-month suspended prison sentence), an Israeli police officer, an Israeli left-wing activist, and the journalist Uri Avnery.

In August 2012, Israeli police arrested Baruch Marzel at the entrance to the town of Kiryat Arba over his failure to report for questioning. He was suspected of being involved in several incidents in Hebron that took place six months prior, in which several Palestinians allegedly were attacked.

In 2014, Yariv Oppenheimer, chairman of Peace Now, signed a police complaint against Marzel alleging threats against his life by his followers. On his Facebook page, Oppenheimer wrote that he is &quot;exiting the police station now, worried and pessimistic. The telephone won&#x27;t stop ringing, and on the other end, human scum who follow Marzel continue to curse and threaten.&quot;

In March 2015, six days before the 2015 legislative election, the Judea-Samaria District Police filed charges in the Jerusalem Magistrate&#x27;s Court alleging that Marzel attacked a Palestinian Arab in 2013. According to the indictment, on 8 February 2013, Marzel entered the home of Hebron resident Issa Amro, as the activist was passing through to visit the Cave of the Patriarchs, and began attacking the Palestinian for &quot;unknown reasons&quot; after Amro demanded he leave. Marzel&#x27;s attorney Itamar Ben-Gvir slammed the indictment, saying it &quot;stinks of election tampering&quot;. This was echoed by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, who stepped in to demand an explanation as to why the indictment came two years after the incident. In February 2017, Marzel was arrested after clashing with police while protesting the demolition of Amona, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.

==Controversies==
=== Anti-LGBT activism ===
Marzel has in the past advocated violence towards homosexuals in Israel, calling for a religious war against them during a radio interview.[source needed] In 2006, in the days leading up to a planned gay pride parade in Jerusalem, Marzel reportedly stated that, &quot;The stabbing incident during last year&#x27;s parade will seem minor in comparison with what is anticipated this year. We have to declare a holy war.&quot;[no source] Marzel also was involved in the controversial March 2009 flag parade through Umm al-Fahm. He led protests against the eighth Jerusalem Gay Pride parade of 2010, opining that &quot;[homosexuality] is a disease of choice, and a man can change his taste and his ways. When someone has AIDS, they tell them not to infect others, so why are these people allowed to march here in Jerusalem and infect us with their disease?&quot;

During the 2012 Gay Pride march in Jerusalem, Marzel led a counter-demonstration in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He brought with him to the demonstration three donkeys. Each of the donkeys bore a sign, one of which read &quot;I&#x27;m proud too&quot;, a second one read &quot;Proud Donkey&quot;, and the third one simply read &quot;Pride March&quot;. Five years later, during the 2017 Jerusalem gay pride march, Marzel again led a counter-demonstration. Despite his previous rhetoric, Marzel stated that he did not protest against LGBT people on a personal level, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not fighting against these people personally, but against the parade and the phenomenon. [...] The nuclear family is a holy thing, and it&#x27;s important to protect it.&quot;

=== Anti-assimilation activism ===
Marzel is seen as a central figure in the anti-assimilation Lehava group, along with Rabbi Ben-Zion Gopstein. In 2006, Marzel sent an open letter to Linor Abargil, asking her not to marry non-Jewish Lithuanian NBA player Šarūnas Jasikevičius. A similar open letter was addressed in March 2010 to Israeli model Bar Refaeli, urging her not to marry her non-Jewish boyfriend at that time, American actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Representing the Lehava organization, Marzel tried to convince Refaeli that her ancestors would have opposed such a marriage. In 2013, he was among 50 activists who held an anti-assimilation protest at a wedding between an Arab man and a Jewish woman. In July 2014, Facebook removed Marzel&#x27;s page after readers complained about incitement.

=== Baruch Goldstein party ===

In 2000, Marzel organized a Purim party at the grave of Baruch Goldstein, the religious extremist who perpetrated the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Marzel was quoted as saying, &quot;We decided to make a big party on the day he was murdered by Arabs.&quot;

==&quot;The Radical Jew&quot;==
A short film about Baruch Marzel called &quot;The Radical Jew&quot; was the Winner of Best Short Documentary at the Charlotte Film Festival and the Golden Strands Award for outstanding short documentary at Tallgrass Film Festival.

== Sanctions ==
On July 15, 2024, the EU added Baruch Marzel to its list of sanctioned individuals for &quot;openly calling for an ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians, together with Ben-Zion “Bentzi” Gopstein, founder and leader of the extremist organisation Lehava, and Isaschar Manne, founder of the unauthorised Manne Farm outpost in the South Hebron Hills.

<doc id="700826" wikidata="Q739475" url="?curid=700826" title="Joel Stebbins">
<text>Joel Stebbins (July 30, 1878 – March 16, 1966) was an American astronomer who pioneered photoelectric photometry in astronomy. He was director of the University of Illinois Observatory from 1903 to 1922 where he performed innovative work with the selenium cell. In 1922 he became director of the Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he remained until 1948. After 1948, Stebbins continued his research at Lick Observatory until his final retirement in 1958.

Stebbins brought photoelectric photometry from its infancy in the early 1900s to a mature technique by the 1950s, when it succeeded photography as the primary method of photometry. He used the new technique to investigate eclipsing binaries, the reddening of starlight by interstellar dust, colors of galaxies, and variable stars.

==Biography==

Joel Stebbins was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 30, 1878, the son of Charles Stebbins, an office worker at the Union Pacific Railroad and his wife Sara Ann née Stubbs. Stebbins had two sisters, Eunice and Millicent. He attended elementary and high school in Omaha, before entering the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1896. He received his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in 1899, and remained for a year as a graduate student before leaving for the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he studied astronomy at the Washburn Observatory under George C. Comstock.

Stebbins published his first paper, concerning the light curve of Nova Persei with Comstock in 1901. He then received a fellowship from the University of California&#x27;s Lick Observatory. He earned his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree there under the supervision of William Wallace Campbell, writing a thesis on the spectra of Omicron Ceti. His was only the third PhD to be awarded for astronomy by the University of California. His thesis was subsequently published in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; in 1903.

Even before Stebbins received his doctorate, he took a job as an instructor in astronomy at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and director of the University of Illinois Observatory. He married May Louise Prentiss, who had been a classmate at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln on June 27, 1905. They had two children, a son, Robert, and a daughter, Isabelle.

Stebbins began making observations with a polarizing photometer. Frustrated by its use, he worked with F.C. Brown to develop a photometer based on a selenium cell. Beginning in 1907, Stebbins began the first measurements using the selenium cell photometer first on the moon and then later, as the sensitivity of the instrument was improved, on variable stars. He examined eclipsing binaries such as Algol starting in 1910. By 1913, Henry Norris Russell had developed the theory of eclipsing binaries, and Stebbins realized that there were many undiscovered ones. He soon found that Beta Aurigae and Delta Orionis were eclipsing binaries. Further discoveries followed.

The development of the photoelectric cell by Jakob Kunz revolutionized astronomical photometry. Kunz&#x27;s photoelectric cells were many times more sensitive than what was available commercially and therefore able to detect faint star light. In 1915, Stebbins used the new photometers to examine Beta Lyrae, a more irregular binary system. The new equipment allowed observations of increasingly faint stars. Stebbins work was recognized with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&#x27; Rumford Prize in 1913, and the United States National Academy of Sciences&#x27; Henry Draper Medal in 1915. The University of Illinois Observatory has been designated a National Historic Landmark based on the significance of Stebbins&#x27; and Kunz&#x27;s work.

In 1922, Stebbins relocated to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he became the director of the Washburn Observatory in succession to George C. Comstock. Stebbins conducted systematic photometric studies of the O-type and B-type main-sequence stars and globular clusters. In later years, he became interested in cosmic dust. His students included Olin J. Eggen, Charles M. Huffer, Gerald Kron and Albert Whitford.

Stebbins retired from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Washburn Observatory in 1948 at the age of seventy, and then went to work at the Lick Observatory, collaborating with Gerald Kron, who had once been his student. They used photometric methods to obtain new values for the luminosity of the Cepheids. This confirmed Walter Baade&#x27;s extragalactic distance scale.

Having dealt with the bright Cepheids, Stebbins and Kron used photometric techniques to study the Sun, which is orders of magnitude brighter than any other object in the sky. Obtaining an accurate assessment of its stellar color and magnitude. He retired for good at the age of eighty.

Stebbins also contributed to ornithology, with his pioneering paper, with E.A. Fath, &quot;The Use of Astronomical Telescopes in Determining the Speeds of Migrating Birds&quot;.

In his later years, he suffered from leukaemia. He died at Palo Alto hospital on March 16, 1966. He was survived by his wife May, son Robert and daughter Isabelle. Some of his papers are in the University of Illinois Archives, but most of his correspondence and scientific papers are preserved in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Archives.

Some of his correspondence, related especially to his early and later days at Lick Observatory, resides in the Mary Lea Shane Archive of Lick Observatory, which is held at the archives of the University of California-Santa Cruz.

<text>The Bishop, formal designation Ordnance QF 25-pdr on Carrier Valentine 25-pdr Mk 1, was a British self-propelled gun vehicle based on the Valentine tank and armed with the QF 25-pounder gun-howitzer, which could fire an HE shell or an armour-piercing shell. A result of a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun, the vehicle had numerous problems, was produced in limited numbers and was soon replaced by better designs.

==Design and development==
The rapid manoeuvre warfare practiced in the North African Campaign led to a requirement for a self-propelled artillery vehicle armed with the 25-pounder gun-howitzer. In June 1941, the development was entrusted to the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. A prototype was ready for trials by August and ordered by November 1941. 

The vehicle was based on the Valentine II hull, with the turret replaced by a fixed boxy superstructure with large rear doors. It was nicknamed the Bishop for its high mitre-like superstructure.

The 25-pounder gun-howitzer was fitted in this superstructure. As a consequence of the gun mounting, the resulting vehicle had a very high silhouette, which is a disadvantage in desert warfare. The maximum elevation for the gun was limited to reducing the range to , about half that of the same gun on a wheeled carriage. To increase range, crews would build large earthen ramps and run the Bishop onto them, tilting the vehicle back to increase the elevation. The maximum depression was , traverse was , and the vehicle could also carry a Bren light machine gun. By July 1942, had been built; as the last being built, an order for a further placed, with an option for a further the tender was abandoned in favour of the American 105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M7. Turkey received 48 Bishops in 1943.

==Combat history==
The Bishop first saw action during the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa and remained in service during the early part of the Italian Campaign. Due to its limitations and the Valentine&#x27;s characteristic slow speed, the Bishop was poorly received. The Bishop was replaced by the M7 Priest and Sexton when those became available in sufficient numbers and surviving Bishops were diverted for training in self-propelled gun tactics.
==British self-propelled guns with ecclesiastical names==
The US 105 Millimeter Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 which replaced the Bishop, was given the service name &quot;Priest&quot; by the British, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a priest&#x27;s pulpit. Following this line of names, a 1942 self-propelled gun armed with the 57 mm QF 6 pounder anti-tank gun was the Deacon, and a 1943 vehicle with the QF 25-pounder on a chassis derived from the M3 Medium tank was the Sexton. This practice was continued after the war with FV433 Abbot and ended in 1993 when they were replaced with the AS-90.
