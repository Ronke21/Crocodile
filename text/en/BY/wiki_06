<text>Arturo Alfonso Schomburg (January 24, 1874 – June 19, 1938), was a historian, writer, curator, and activist, who wrote numerous books. Schomburg was a Puerto Rican of African and German descent. He moved to the United States in 1891, settling in New York City (at the age of 17) where he researched and raised awareness of the contributions that Afro-Latin Americans and African Americans have made to society. He was an important intellectual figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Over the years, he collected literature, art, slave narratives, and other materials of African history, which were purchased to become the basis of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, named in his honor, at the New York Public Library (NYPL) branch in Harlem.

==Early years==
Schomburg was born and spent the majority of his childhood in the town of Santurce in the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico, to Mary Joseph, a freeborn Black midwife from St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, and Carlos Federico Schomburg, a merchant and son of a German immigrant to Puerto Rico. He was baptized as a Catholic, with the name Arturo Alfonso, at the Church of San Francisco de Asis in Santurce, San Juan.

While Schomburg was in grade school, one of his teachers claimed that Black people had no history, heroes or accomplishments. Inspired to prove the teacher wrong, Schomburg determined that he would find and document the accomplishments of Africans on their own continent and in the diaspora.

Schomburg was educated at San Juan&#x27;s &quot;Instituto Popular&quot;, where he learned commercial printing. At St. Thomas College on the island of St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies, he studied Negro literature.

He became a member of the &quot;Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico&quot; and became an active advocate of Puerto Rico&#x27;s and Cuba&#x27;s independence from Spain. In 1892, Schomburg co-founded Las Dos Antillas (The Two Islands), a political club that advocated for the independence of Cuba and Puerto Rico. The club existed from 1892 to 1898, and members discussed issues such as providing weapons, medical supplies, and financial aid to independence movements.

==Marriage and family==
On June 30, 1895, Schomburg married Elizabeth Hatcher of Staunton, Virginia. She had come to New York as part of a wave of migration from the South that would increase in the 20th century and be known as the Great Migration. They had three sons: Máximo Gómez (named after the Dominican military leader of the Cuban struggle for independence); Arthur Alfonso, Jr. and Kingsley Guarionex Schomburg (named after Guarionex, a renowned cacique of the Taíno).

After Elizabeth died in 1900, Schomburg married Elizabeth Morrow Taylor of Williamsburg, a village in Rockingham County, North Carolina. They were married on March 17, 1902, and had two sons: Reginald Stanton and Nathaniel José Schomburg. After Elizabeth Morrow Taylor&#x27;s death, Schomburg married Elizabeth Green, with whom he had three more children.

==Career==
In 1896, Schomburg began teaching Spanish in New York. From 1901 to 1906 Schomburg was employed as messenger and clerk in the law firm of Pryor, Mellis and Harris, New York City. In 1906, he began working for the Bankers Trust Company. Later, he became a supervisor of the Caribbean and Latin American Mail Section, and held that until he left in 1929.

While supporting himself and his family, Schomburg began his intellectual work of writing about Caribbean and African-American history. His first known article, &quot;Is Hayti Decadent?&quot;, was published in 1904 in &quot;The Unique Advertiser&quot;. In 1909 he wrote &quot;Placido, a Cuban Martyr&quot;, a short pamphlet about the poet and independence fighter Gabriel de la Concepción Valdés. In the 1910 US Census, he is recorded as a printer working in a shop and living at 205 West 115th Street in Harlem, New York City.
==The Negro Society for Historical Research==
In 1911, Schomburg co-founded with John Edward Bruce the Negro Society for Historical Research, to create an institute to support scholarly efforts. For the first time, it brought together African, West Indian, and Afro-American scholars. In 1914, Schomburg joined the exclusive American Negro Academy, becoming, from 1920 to 1928, the fifth and last President of the organization. Founded in Washington, D.C., in 1897, this first major African American learned society brought together scholars, editors, and activists to refute racist scholarship, promote Black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and publish the history and sociology of African American life.

This was a period of the founding of societies to encourage scholarship in African-American history. In 1915, Dr. Carter G. Woodson co-founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (now called the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) and began publishing the &quot;Journal of Negro History&quot;.

Schomburg became involved in the Harlem Renaissance movement, which spread to other African-American communities in the U.S. The concentration of Black people in Harlem from across the US and Caribbean led to a flowering of arts, as well as intellectual and political movements. Schomburg co-edited the 1912 edition of Daniel Alexander Payne Murray&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of the Colored Race&quot;. He later became disillusioned with the Harlem Renaissance, because he felt that there were no more revolutionaries within it. He told anthologist Nancy Cunard that she should &quot;not expect to find anything revolutionary or critical in these subjected fellows&#x27; writings... [T]hey have been bought and paid for by white people&quot;.

In 1916 Schomburg published the first notable bibliography of African-American poetry, &quot;A Bibliographical Checklist of American Negro Poetry&quot;.

In March 1925 Schomburg published his essay &quot;The Negro Digs Up His Past&quot; in an issue of &quot;Survey Graphic&quot; devoted to the intellectual life of Harlem. It had widespread distribution and influence. In &quot;The Negro Digs Up His Past,&quot; Schomburg was trying to lay the groundwork for an intellectual refutation of racism. The autodidact historian John Henrik Clarke told of being so inspired by the essay that at the age of 17 he left home in Columbus, Georgia, to seek out Mr. Schomburg to further his studies in African history. Alain Locke included the essay in his edited collection &quot;The New Negro&quot;.

In March 1926, Schomburg visited Spain. &quot;His mission was to research and explore centuries of Black life in Europe, including that of the painter Juan de Pareja. A notable artist in his own right, Pareja was an enslaved studio assistant to famed Spanish painter Diego Velázquez&quot;. The Metropolitan Museum of Art stated, &quot;Schomburg was vital to the recovery of Pareja’s work&quot;.

==The Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature and Art==
The New York Public Library and the librarian of the 135th Street Branch, Ernestine Rose, purchased Schomburg&#x27;s private collection of more than 4,000 books for $10,000, funded by the Carnegie Corporation in 1926. This purchase would signal the beginning of the transformation of the 135th street&#x27;s branch into the Schomburg Center. His collection included a variety of items, including the acquisition of three missing chapters from “The Autobiography of Malcolm X,” that were cut from his manuscript after his death in 1965. They appointed Schomburg curator of the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature and Art, named in his honor, at the 135th Street Branch (Harlem) of the Library. It was later renamed the Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

In 1929 Fisk University President Charles S. Johnson invited Schomburg to curate the Negro Collection at the library of Fisk in Nashville, Tennessee. He assisted in the architectural design contributing to the construction of a reading room and browsing space. By the end of Schomburg&#x27;s tenure at Fisk he had expanded the library&#x27;s collection from 106 items to 4,600. During 1932 he traveled to Cuba. While there he met various Cuban artists and writers, and acquired more material for his studies.

He was granted an honorary membership of the Men&#x27;s Business Club in Yonkers, New York. He also held the position of treasurer for the Loyal Sons of Africa in New York and was elevated being the past master of Prince Hall Lodge Number 38, Free and Accepted Masons (F.A.M.) and Rising Sun Chapter Number 4, R.A.M.

==Later years==
Following dental surgery, Schomburg became ill and died in Madison Park Hospital in Brooklyn on June 10, 1938. He received a private funeral on June 12 at Siloam Presbyterian Church. He is buried in the Locust Grove section of Cypress Hills Cemetery.

==Legacy==

By the 1920s Schomburg had amassed a collection which consisted of artworks, manuscripts, rare books, slave narratives and other artifacts of Black history. The collection formed the cornerstone of the Library&#x27;s Division of Negro History at its 135th Street Branch in Harlem. The library appointed Schomburg curator of the collection, which was named in his honor: the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Schomburg used his proceeds from the sale to fund travel to Spain, France, Germany and England, to seek out more pieces of black history to add to the collection. 

Arturo Alfonso Schomburg&#x27;s work served as an inspiration to Puerto Ricans, Latinos and Afro-Americans alike. During the Harlem Renaissance, Zora Neale Hurston and others used Schomburg&#x27;s materials. The power of knowing about the great contributions that Afro-Latin Americans and Afro-Americans have made to society helped advance the civil rights movement.

* In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Schomburg on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. To honor Schomburg, Hampshire College awards a $30,000 merit-based scholarship in his name for students who &quot;demonstrate promise in the areas of strong academic performance and leadership at Hampshire College and in the community.&quot; 

* The College of Arts and Sciences at University at Buffalo has a fellowship named in honor of Schomburg.

* A residence hall at New York&#x27;s Stony Brook University is named for Schomberg.

* In 2020, the United States Postal Service featured Schomburg on a postage stamp as part of its series on the Harlem Renaissance.

<text>Westport is a historic neighborhood and a main entertainment district in Kansas City, Missouri.

In the early 1800s, West Port was settled by a group led by American pioneer and tribal missionary Reverend Isaac McCoy, who brought his son John Calvin McCoy as surveyor, and his son-in-law Reverend Johnston Lykins who bought the land. To compete with Independence to the east, and with veteran pioneering trader François Chouteau to the north, John McCoy forged a road from West Port north to a Missouri River landing rock next to Chouteau&#x27;s landing. McCoy&#x27;s West Port Landing soon combined in the 1830s with Chouteau&#x27;s Town atop the levee bluff to form the settlement called Kansas. That was incorporated as the City of Kansas, which allied with the shared origin of West Port and boomed. West Port became a gateway to the westward expansion trails through Kansas Territory, and for border ruffians into Bleeding Kansas. It suffered the American Civil War&#x27;s Battle of Westport in October 1864, and wagon trails became obsolete to distant railroads, so West Port declined to rural town status. The City of Kansas became Kansas City in 1889, which annexed Westport in 1897. Historical sites include Kelly&#x27;s Westport Inn, the oldest surviving building in Kansas City.

==History==

Westport was first settled by American pioneer and tribal Baptist minister Reverend Isaac McCoy, along with his family and Baptist cohort in 1831. It is located approximately three miles due south of what became downtown Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO). He built a large log house on a hill at what became 43rd and Wornall. His son John Calvin McCoy built a two-story residence and trading post at what became the northeast corner of Westport Road and Pennsylvania Ave. In 1851, the Ewing Brothers built a store at what became the northwest corner, and which became Kelly&#x27;s Westport Inn, which is the oldest surviving building in KCMO. Albert G. Boone, the grandson of American pioneer Daniel Boone, bought the Ewings&#x27; store to provision the booming 1850s westward expansion trails into Kansas Territory, and as an organizing place for Boone&#x27;s pro-slavery forces.

John McCoy was a degreed surveyor by trade, and platted West Port, buying the parcel from his brother in law and fellow missionary Johnston Lykins, and then formally incorporated in February 1857. He is generally considered the &quot;father of Kansas City&quot;. He ordered supplies to be landed at a rocky point on the Missouri River between Grand and Main streets, which became known as Westport&#x27;s Landing. When the landing became popular enough to attract business from the next landing at Independence, fourteen pioneering investors including John McCoy formed the Town of Kansas company to buy the land, including Westport&#x27;s Landing, parcels from Johnston Lykins, and parcels from Gabriel Prud&#x27;homme. Westport&#x27;s trade with native tribes extended to the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.

By 1850, the combined settlements of West Port and Kansas surpassed Independence&#x27;s role as an outfitting and starting point for traders, trappers, and emigrants heading west on the Santa Fe and Oregon trails. West Port&#x27;s greatest prosperity came between 1854 and 1860. The Civil War brought many skirmishes between pro- and anti-slavery groups in the area, and the Battle of Westport was in October 1864. After the war, trade fell off sharply and never recovered, and by 1899, Kansas City annexed Westport.

The cholera pandemic of 1849 had killed half of the populations of each of the two area boomtowns of West Port and Kansas, totaling thousands. This filled each of their sole cemeteries, prompting the search for one new cemetery site halfway between, to unify both communities for all time. On November 9, 1857, while the newly incorporated City of Kansas (renamed from the town of Kansas) had a population of about 4,000, Union Cemetery was opened. It is the oldest surviving cemetery in what became KCMO.

The historic Nutterville area, east of Broadway Street, was developed by James B. Nutter Sr. who ensured that its old homes were restored by being adapted as business offices. The houses are colorfully painted and landscaped.

<text>Carl Demonte Crawford (born August 5, 1981), nicknamed &quot;the Perfect Storm&quot;, is an American former professional baseball left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers. He batted and threw left-handed.

Crawford is best known for his nine years with the Rays, during which he was considered one of the best baserunners in baseball. He led the American League in stolen bases and triples four times each while with Tampa Bay.

==Early life==
Crawford is a native of the Fifth Ward area of Houston. He participated in the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities program, and attended Jefferson Davis High School in Houston, Texas, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. As a child, he was on the same little league team as Michael Bourn, who also played in MLB. 
In high school baseball, he began working with former #1 pick Willie Ansley after his sophomore year. He batted .638 as a senior. In the summer of his junior year in high school coach Ansley advised him to get on a team that played in the same tournaments that Josh Beckett played in so he could be seen by the pro scouts and Crawford joined the Pasadena Stars select baseball team. It was there that he gained his first real exposure to Major League Baseball scouts. So intent on capitalizing on this exposure, he was advised by coach Ansley to skip basketball his senior year to concentrate on baseball so that his knees would be fresh from the beginning of the season. Crawford was offered scholarships to play basketball as a point guard at UCLA. He also had an option to play college football as an option quarterback at Nebraska, USC, Oklahoma, Florida, and Tulsa. He had originally signed a letter of intent to play football for Nebraska, but he turned down both offers in favor of a baseball career.

==Professional career==
Crawford was drafted by the Devil Rays in the second round (52nd overall) of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft.

===Minor leagues===
In 2002, the Tampa Bay chapter of the BBWAA named Crawford the Devil Rays&#x27; Most Outstanding Rookie, and he earned International League Rookie of the Year playing for the AAA Durham Bulls.

===Major leagues===

====Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays (2002–2010)====

=====2002–2006=====
Crawford made his Major League debut at age 20 on July 20, 2002, against the Toronto Blue Jays. His first hit was in that game, a two RBI single off Steve Parris. He hit his first home run on August 10 off Shawn Sedlacek of the Kansas City Royals. He played in 63 games for the Devil Rays in 2002, batting .259 with 9 stolen bases.

In 2003, Crawford had a breakout season, batting .281 with 54 RBI and leading the league with 55 steals. Along with Juan Pierre, Crawford was co-winner of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell Legacy Award for 2003.

In 2004, Crawford stole 59 bases, again leading the league and posting the second-highest total in the majors that season. He batted .296 with 11 home runs and 55 RBIs. Crawford also hit a league-leading 19 triples. He was selected for the All Star Game, played in his hometown of Houston, and was named Devil Rays team MVP in 2004 by the BBWAA.

Crawford batted .301 in 2005, becoming just the third .300 hitter in Devil Rays history, joining Aubrey Huff (.311 in 2003) and Fred McGriff (.310 in 1999). Crawford also posted career highs in hits (194), home runs (15), and RBI (81). He again led the league with 15 triples and placed third in steals (46).
On July 5, 2006, against the Boston Red Sox, Crawford became only the eighth player in history to get 200 stolen bases before his 25th birthday. Crawford finished the season with career highs in batting average (.305) and home runs (18), joining Hall-of-Famer Rogers Hornsby as the only players in Major League history to increase their batting average and home run totals every year for five straight years. He won a Fielding Bible Award for his defensive excellence in left field during the season.

=====2007–2010=====
Crawford was named an All-Star for the second time in 2007, becoming the first Devil Ray to receive the honor more than once. He homered in the 6th inning of the All-Star Game, on a 3–2 pitch from Francisco Cordero of the Milwaukee Brewers.

In the second half of the season, Crawford had a sore right wrist which had been bothering him for some time, and did not hit a home run for a period of 42 days. Prior to a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, he had an MRI and was listed as doubtful to play because of the wrist. However, he pinch hit as the game went into extra innings and hit a walk-off home run, ending his drought. This kicked off a run of four homers in ten games. In August, ESPN.com named Crawford the Devil Rays&#x27; &quot;Face of the Franchise&quot;.

On April 11, 2008, Crawford accumulated his 1,000th hit, making him the eighth player to hit 1,000 and steal 250 bases before turning 27. In game four of the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox, Crawford tied an ALCS record with five hits in one game, going 5–5 and stealing two bases. After the season, he won his second Fielding Bible Award.

In 2008, he had surgery to fix the tendon of the middle finger of his right hand.
On May 3, 2009, Carl Crawford tied a modern-era record by stealing six bases in a game against the Boston Red Sox, part of a team-record eight total stolen bases. On July 14, 2009, Crawford represented Tampa Bay in the 2009 All Star Game, where he was named MVP for a leaping catch at the top of the 8-foot outfield wall to prevent a possible go-ahead home run by Rockies outfielder Brad Hawpe.

In 2009, he had the best range factor of all starting major league left fielders (2.34). He won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award and third overall at left field.

On July 31, 2010, Crawford reached 400 stolen bases. He is the 7th player in history to reach that mark before his 29th birthday. On August 17, 2010, Crawford hit the 100th triple of his career, joining Ty Cobb as the only major league players to hit 100 triples and steal 400 bases before the age of 30. He finished the 2010 season with a career-high 19 home runs and 90 RBIs.

The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America voted Crawford the Most Valuable Player for the Rays in 2010. Following the conclusion of the season, Crawford was given the Gold Glove Award, as well as the Silver Slugger Award.

====Boston Red Sox (2011–2012)====

On December 8, 2010, Crawford signed a seven-year, $142-million contract with the Boston Red Sox. Crawford struggled to begin the 2011 season, batting .137 and stealing only 2 bases in his first 12 games. On May 3, he hit his 1,500th career hit, a single against Dan Haren of the Los Angeles Angels in the 3rd inning, becoming the 588th player with 1,500 or more career hits.

For the 2011 season, he batted .255 with an on-base percentage of .289. Through 2011, he had the third-best career fielding percentage (.990) among all active major league left fielders, behind Ryan Braun and Reed Johnson.
However, on the last day of the regular season, his unsuccessful attempt to catch a ninth-inning line drive off the bat of Robert Andino was ruled a trap, allowing the Baltimore Orioles to walk off and completing Boston&#x27;s historic nine-game September collapse that denied them a postseason berth.

Crawford injured his left wrist in January 2012. He had wrist surgery to repair cartilage damage, but had discomfort in his elbow and was told he had a sprained ligament.

He began the 2012 season on the 60-day disabled list. He had a rehab assignment with the Gulf Coast League, Double-A Portland, and Triple-A Pawtucket to recover from both injuries. Crawford made his 2012 regular season debut on July 16, 2012, against the Chicago White Sox.

On August 23, 2012, Crawford underwent season-ending reconstructive Tommy John surgery to repair a chronic ulnar collateral tear in his left elbow. For 2012, he batted .282/.306/.479 in 117 at bats. After being traded to the Dodgers, Crawford voiced his unhappiness with the Red Sox organization and the city of Boston, claiming that the baseball environment was &quot;toxic&quot; and that he was in a &quot;depression stage&quot; with Boston.

====Los Angeles Dodgers (2012–2016)====

=====2012=====
On August 25, 2012, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Josh Beckett, Adrián González, Nick Punto, and $11 million in cash) for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, Jr., Allen Webster, and two players to be named later (Jerry Sands and Rubby De La Rosa). Despite initial concerns that his injury would keep him out for the first part of the 2013 season as well, Crawford made his Dodger debut as the starting left fielder and lead off hitter on Opening Day 2013.

=====2013=====
Crawford got off to a hot start with the Dodgers in 2013, hitting .308 with 4 home runs in the month of April. In 2013 with the Dodgers, missing almost one full month with a hamstring injury, he played in 116 games and hit .283/.329/.407 with 6 homers, 31 RBIs, and 15 stolen bases.

In the 2013 NLDS against the Braves, Crawford hit three home runs, including two in Game 4, which gave the Dodgers a huge boost and allowed them to beat the Braves in four games.

=====2014=====
Crawford had a slow start to the 2014 season, hitting just .191 in the month of April. However, he bounced back with a strong month of May, hitting .333. On May 27, Crawford suffered a sprained left ankle in a game against the Cincinnati Reds and was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day. He was reactivated on July 10 after a rehab assignment with the Albuquerque Isotopes. Crawford finished the regular season with his highest batting average since leaving Tampa Bay. He hit .300 in 105 games, with 8 home runs, 46 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases.

=====2015=====
On April 27, 2015, Crawford tore his oblique muscle in a game against the Giants and was placed on the disabled list. He did not rejoin the Dodgers active roster until July 21. He appeared in 69 games for the Dodgers in 2015, hitting .265.

=====2016=====
Crawford spent the first two months of 2016 as a backup outfielder/occasional pinch hitter. In 30 games, he hit .185 with a .230 on-base percentage in 81 at bats. On June 5, Crawford was designated for assignment with approximately $35 million remaining on his contract. On June 13, he was released by the Dodgers. In a 2017 interview, Crawford said that he declined offers to try out with other major league teams after the Dodgers released him and was planning to retire when his final contract expired.

=====Career statistics=====
In 1,716 games over 15 seasons, Crawford posted a .290 batting average (1931-for-6655) with 998 runs, 309 doubles, 123 triples, 136 home runs, 766 RBI, 480 stolen bases, 377 bases on balls, .330 on-base percentage and .435 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .989 fielding percentage playing at left and center field. In 39 postseason games, he hit .260 (40-for-154) with 21 runs, 5 doubles, 7 home runs, 16 RBI, 10 stolen bases and 6 walks.

==Personal life==

Crawford&#x27;s first cousin once removed, J. P. Crawford, also plays baseball. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1st round of the 2013 MLB draft, 17th overall.

Carl has two children with Amy Freeman: son, Justin, born in 2004 and daughter, Ari, born in June 2013. Justin Crawford was selected in the first round of the 2022 MLB draft.

In December 2013, Crawford announced his engagement to Evelyn Lozada. Crawford and Lozada have a son, Carl Jr., who was born in March 2014. In August 2017, the couple called off the engagement.

In May 2020, Crawford was arrested and charged with assaulting an ex-girlfriend Gabriele Washington in the presence of their one-year-old daughter.

On May 16, 2020, a five-year-old boy and 25-year-old woman drowned in the swimming pool during a party at Crawford&#x27;s home in Harris County, Texas. The child&#x27;s mother filed a lawsuit against Crawford that June.

=== 1501 Certified Entertainment ===
Crawford is CEO of 1501 Certified Entertainment, an independent record label based in Houston. In early 2018, the label signed hip-hop artist Megan Thee Stallion, who quickly rose to fame with a string of hit songs. All of her releases from 1501 Certified are now marketed by 300 Entertainment and distributed by Warner Music Group. In March 2020, several months after she signed a management deal with Roc Nation, Megan Thee Stallion sued 1501 Certified and Crawford, claiming they were blocking her from releasing music while refusing to renegotiate or terminate a contract she called &quot;entirely unconscionable.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Crawford denied wrongdoing, insisted the contract was generous for a new musical act, and characterized the lawsuit as an attempt by Roc Nation to intimidate him into renegotiating.

<doc id="692927" wikidata="Q612560" url="?curid=692927" title="Luas">
<text>Luas (, ; Irish for &quot;speed&quot;) is a tram system in Dublin, Ireland. There are two main lines: the Green Line, which began operating on 30 June 2004, and the Red Line which opened on 26 September 2004. Since then, the red line has been extended and split into different branches further out of the city and the green line has been extended north and south as a single line. Since the northern extension of the green line in 2017, the two lines intersect in the city centre. The system now has 67 stops and of revenue track, which in 2023 carried 48.2 million passengers, an increase of 24% compared to 2022.

Luas is operated by Transdev, under tender from Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). (Prior to the later RPA merger with the National Roads Authority to form TII, the tender was originally under the defunct Railway Procurement Agency jurisdiction). The Luas was a major part of the National Transport Authority&#x27;s strategy (2000–2016). Four extensions to the initial Luas lines have been completed. Construction of a extension of the Green line through the north city centre to Broombridge, which linked both Green and Red lines, began in June 2013 and opened to passengers in December 2017. This is the extension route previously known officially as BXD.

==History==
The idea for a new tram or light rail system for the city of Dublin was first suggested, in the 1990s, by a Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) report, which referenced the original Dublin tramways, once running over and reaching most parts of the city. Following this report Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the state-owned public transport operator in Ireland, was asked to study the different options. They recommended two phases for the construction of a tram system:

*Phase 1: Tallaght to Dundrum/Balally via the City Centre
*Phase 2: Ballymun to the City Centre and Dundrum/Balally to Sandyford.

The Transport Act, 1996 created a legal framework for CIÉ to build a tram system and in May 1997 the company applied for a Light Railway Order to construct the first phase, as well as the Dundrum/Balally to Sandyford part of phase 2.

An inquiry started in July 1997, but was put on hold to investigate the possibility of underground sections in the city centre. In May 1998 the government decided to build two lines, amending the plans. The first was to run from Tallaght to Connolly Station, while the second would run from Sandyford Industrial Estate to Dublin Airport, through the city centre and Ballymun. Part of the second was to be underground through the city centre. In promotional content from the mid-1990s, journey time from Tallaght to the city centre was predicted to take 30 minutes.

The responsibility for developing Luas was transferred from CIÉ to the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), a separate government agency created in December 2001.

Construction work began in March 2001 on the Tallaght to Connolly line, as well as the Sandyford to St. Stephen&#x27;s Green section of the second line, with Ansaldo of Italy and MVM of Australia getting the contract to build the system. The St. Stephen&#x27;s Green to Dublin Airport section was dropped before construction began, as it was decided to serve the area by a metro instead. The contract to maintain and operate the system was awarded to Connex.

The development of Luas Red Line was facilitated by European Union funding of €82.5 million under the European Regional Development Fund, and part of the cost of some line extensions (e.g. over 50% of Line B1 to Cherrywood) was raised though levies on development in areas close to the projected route.

===Launch===
The original launch date for Luas was to be 2003, but delays in construction saw this date pushed back by a year. An advertising campaign took place to inform the public of the development of the system, while construction was taking place. Construction finished in February 2004 and a period of testing and driver training began. 30 June 2004 was decided on as the official launch date of the Green Line. The first tram went into service for the general public at 3 p.m. Several days of free travel and a family fun weekend took place to launch the system. The Red Line opened on 26 September 2004, with six days of free travel for the general public.

===2004 to present===
By November 2006, over 50 million journeys had been made on the system. Around 90,000 Luas trips are made each day. In 2007, 28.4 million journeys were made; there were 27.4 million journeys in 2008 and 25.4 million journeys in 2009. To date, the busiest day on Luas was Friday, 21 December 2007 when 145,000 passenger journeys were recorded.

Luas operates without a state subsidy. The service recorded a surplus of €985,000 (€680,000 in 2004) – an achievement well ahead of an anticipated deficit of €2.5 million.

On Tuesday, 8 December 2009 the Red Line C1 Connolly to Docklands extension opened. There are four stops: George&#x27;s Dock, Mayor Square-NCI, Spencer Dock (serving the new Docklands railway station, approximately away) and terminating in Point Village, opposite the 3Arena, this extension however bypasses Connolly. Construction started at the beginning of June 2007. Test runs began on the line in September 2009 before the opening.

On 16 October 2010, the B1 extension from Sandyford to Cherrywood opened.

====Luas Cross City====

In June 2010, plans to join the two Luas tracks were finalised. On 20 May 2011 Dublin City Council made submissions to An Bord Pleanála&#x27;s Oral Hearing into Line BXD stating that the Planning Authority had a serious area of concern with the overhead conductor system in the historical city centre asking for a wire-free zone.

Luas Cross City is an extension of the Green Line which links with the Red Line, and continues northwards to Broombridge railway station in North Dublin (interchange with Iarnród Éireann station). The extension began at the existing St Stephen&#x27;s Green Green Line stop. Construction started in June 2013, with services beginning in December 2017.

*Line BX (includes Line D to Broombridge) – City Centre link for Red and Green Lines. The RPA started public consultation on the route in December 2005. In March 2007 the preferred route was announced. The route runs from St Stephen&#x27;s Green to College Green where the line changes from a double track to single track. From here it runs north through Westmoreland Street, over O&#x27;Connell Bridge and along the west side of O&#x27;Connell Street to Cathal Brugha Street. It then turns east into Cathal Brugha Street and turns south to run along Marlborough Street, across the River Liffey on the Rosie Hackett Bridge, continues along Hawkins Street and College Street and joins up with the double-track section of the line at College Green. 2012 was the original completion date given in the Transport 21 plans, but construction only started in 2013. The completion date, along with the commencement of passenger services, was December 2017. The RPA applied for a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanála for a combined Line D / Line BX Luas Line that runs from St Stephen&#x27;s Green to Broombridge via the city centre and Broadstone / Grangegorman.
*Line D – City Centre to Liffey Junction. This serves Grangegorman, the site of the new TU Dublin campus. This line is linked with the Maynooth line.

On 10 November 2011, the government announced in its 2012–16 Infrastructure and Capital Investment plan that the project to link the Red and Green lines, known as BXD, was to proceed. No other new lines or extensions were being funded. Construction work for the new Rosie Hackett bridge across the River Liffey (connecting Marlborough St and Hawkins St) began in April 2012, on which the southbound Luas BXD track was laid. A Railway Order was granted by An Bord Pleanála for Luas BXD line on 3 August 2012. The project was subsequently branded as Luas Cross City. Cross City opened to passengers on 9 December 2017.

==Infrastructure==


===Stops and lines===
The network currently comprises two lines:
# Red Line – The Point or Connolly to Saggart or Tallaght (each route is approximately long, but the total track length is longer since the Belgard-Tallaght and Belgard-Saggart sections are separate parts of the Red Line)
# Green Line – Broombridge via Sandyford to Bride&#x27;s Glen, 

The Red Line runs east–west through Dublin&#x27;s Northside, then crosses the River Liffey and travels southwest to the heavily populated suburb of Tallaght, and then on through the Citywest campus to terminate at Saggart. It was planned, designed and constructed in two separate stages:
* Line A: Tallaght to O&#x27;Connell Street
* Line C: O&#x27;Connell Street to Connolly Station

This was followed by two extensions:
* Line C1 from Connolly to The Point, which opened in December 2009
* Line A1, the spur from Belgard to Saggart, which opened in July 2011

On the south side of Dublin city, the Green Line mostly follows the route of the old Harcourt Street railway line, which was reserved for possible reuse when it closed in 1958, although some diversions have been made. It was known internally as Line B during planning and construction, and has also had several extensions:
* Line B was originally from Sandyford to St Stephen&#x27;s Green.
* Line B1 is the extension from Sandyford to Bride&#x27;s Glen which opened in July 2010.
* Line BX is the extension from St Stephen&#x27;s Green to connect with the Red Line which opened in December 2017.
* Line D extends Line BX to Broombridge and opened simultaneously with Line BX in December 2017.
* Line B2 is a proposed extension from Bride&#x27;s Glen to Bray.

The cost of building the original Red and Green Lines was €728m.
It was envisaged in the original plans that the Green Line would meet the Red Line at O&#x27;Connell Street. However, two separate unconnected lines were built, leaving a (10–15 minute walk) – through O&#x27;Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, College Green and Grafton Street – between the two lines. Plans to link the lines were announced with the proposed building of the BX Line under Transport 21: this was opened to passengers on 9 December 2017. There are 32 stops on the Red Line and 35 (plus two extra unopened stops surrounding Carrickmines) on the Green Line.

A third line to Lucan (Line F) was planned. It was planned to start in the city centre and travel north west to Lucan. However, as of April 2024, no information is available on any plans to progress this line.

===Track and rolling stock===

The system operates on a overhead power supply. The international standard track gauge of is used, rather than the Irish .

The silver Alstom Citadis trams, manufactured in La Rochelle, France, reach a top speed of on off-street sections, but travel at a slower speed on-street where conflicts with other vehicles and pedestrians can occur. The 26 initial Red Line &#x27;3000&#x27; Class trams were long Citadis 301 configurations with a capacity of 256. The 14 initial Green Line &#x27;4000 Class&#x27; trams, each long Citadis 401 configurations, have a capacity of 358 including two wheelchairs. Starting in 2007, all the Red line trams were upgraded to by inserting two more articulated sections, with the last one converted by June 2008. Both configurations of tramcars are fully compatible with both the Red and the Green Lines.

26 new 43-metre Citadis 402 trams, numbered as the &#x27;5000 Class&#x27;, were ordered for delivery in early 2009. These are 100% low-floor configuration and solely operate on the Green Line, with the 4000 Class trams cascaded to the Red Line after the entire 5000 Class had been introduced.

7, Citadis 502 variants were procured for use on the St. Stephen&#x27;s Green – Broombridge line. They were brought into service between January and June 2018. These are numbered as members of the 5000 Class. Between 2019 and 2021, all existing 5000 Class units of the Citadis 402 standard have been lengthened to match the Citadis 502 standard with minor differences. 8 further new 502 units were ordered for delivery during 2020, with the first of those entering service in July 2020.

In other aspects, the two lines are identical except that the inter-axis width between the tracks on the Green Line is slightly wider than on the Red Line. The construction planning for the Green Line ensures a distance of track centres at including a extra for the kinematic envelope of metro trains. This does not relate to the track gauge of , which is identical on both lines. This will allow wider metro trains be run on the same tracks if a proposed upgrade to full metro service is implemented. This is possible because the route uses an old railway line and as such has few interactions with vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The Railway Procurement Agency has stated (November 2006) that &quot;We still envisage conversion of almost all Luas lines to light metro standard in the long-term&quot;. Platform length also varies between lines, with the original platforms lengthened to on the Green Line.

The main engineering structures on the Green Line at present are Milltown Viaduct, also known as The Nine Arches, a large stone viaduct dating from 1854, and the William Dargan Bridge, a large cable-stayed bridge at Taney Cross, near Dundrum town centre.

==Travel on Luas==
===Ticketing===

Luas tickets are purple in colour and credit card sized. They bear a magnetic stripe on the back although this is not used on Luas. Uniquely among Dublin&#x27;s public transport, tickets are not checked upon boarding trams; instead, a proof-of-payment system is used.

Ticket machines operate at every Luas stop and these are the only source of single-journey and return tickets. They also sell 1-day, 7-day and 30-day tickets, valid in either some or all the fare zones, for adults, children and students. Combi tickets valid on Dublin Bus and Luas are no longer on general sale, but can be purchased as commuter tickets via the &quot;Taxsaver&quot; scheme, as can various other combinations of bus, Luas, and Iarnród Éireann commuter train service. Certain ticket combinations are not possible (for example a one-day student ticket), and tickets can only be valid from the stop at which they are purchased and must commence their validity within 90 minutes, valid until a specific time shown on the card. Certain tickets require the user to hold an ID card and write the number on the ticket, to prevent the ticket from being transferred to another person. Ticket machines accept card payments (by American Express, MasterCard, or Visa) and have a weekly limit of €150 (upper limit changed from €50 per transaction to €150 per week in January 2012 after upgrading all POS terminals to have a PIN keypad). Formerly €5 was the minimum amount which could be paid via card, but this limit has since been removed. Student tickets can be loaded to a Student Leap card, issued upon verification of student status. No other form of student identification is accepted on Luas.

Tickets cannot be purchased on board the trams. Passengers encountered by a ticket inspector and not in possession of a valid ticket or validated Leap card are issued a fine (referred to as a standard fare) of €100, reduced to €45 for prompt payment. Non-payment within 28 days may result in prosecution.

The lines are divided into 10 zones, five for the green line and four for the red, plus a shared central zone. Most passengers use a Leap card, for which travel within a single zone is charged as a &quot;short journey&quot;, with any longer trips charged at a flat fare for 90-minutes travel, including transfers onto bus and train services in the Dublin zone. Paper single and return tickets charge varying fares depending on the number of zones crossed. When the network opened, it was necessary to walk some distance or take another form of transport to connect between the two lines, but nowadays there is a short walking connection between O&#x27;Connell - GPO or Marlborough Street on the green line and Abbey Street on the red line.

===Smartcard===

In March 2005, a smartcard for Luas was launched. The smartcard was phased out following launch of the integrated Leap Card which is further detailed below. The final day of Luas Smartcard operations was on 30 September 2014. The Luas smartcard allowed travellers to pay for travel on the Luas network. Credit was pre-loaded onto the smartcard at ticket machines by cash, debit card or credit card, with a minimum top-up of €5 and a maximum credit on the card of €100, and the customer had to validate the card using readers on the platform before boarding the tram and then again after exiting the tram. This is still referred to as &#x27;tag-on&#x27; and &#x27;tag-off&#x27; on the current Leap Card system.

A smartcard could be purchased at a Luas ticket agent or online. The card cost €10, which included a €3 non-refundable charge for the card, €3 of credit and €4 for a fully refundable &#x27;reserve fund&#x27; which allowed travel even if there was insufficient credit on the card for the journey. The card had to be topped up before another journey could be taken.

Smartcard fares were slightly cheaper than standard single and return fares from ticket machines. For example, a journey within a single zone cost €1.25 with the card, compared to €1.50 (€1.60 during peak time) single with a paper ticket, or €2.80 return. Daily, 7-day and 30-day tickets generally worked out cheaper, unless used only rarely. Luas smartcards were unable to store multiple-journey tickets and these tickets were issued on paper only until May 2014, since all tickets have been loaded onto the new Leap Cards.

Until January 2012 there were three different smart-card systems in Dublin: the Luas smart-card, the Dublin Bus prepaid Smartcard system for day-cards or longer and the smart-card for commuter trains and the DART which is -as the Luas card- a per journey tag on/off card but not compatible with Luas cards.

The &quot;Leap Card&quot; smartcard has functionality that it caps the daily and weekly spend to ensure Leap Card holders do not pay more than they would have had they bought day, weekly, or monthly tickets. This functionality had been enabled on Luas and DART services. As of 2017, the National Transport Authority reported the number of Leap Card users was 2.5 million.

===Free travel===
All persons in Ireland are entitled to be issued with a Public Services Card for accessing key public services and for identity purposes. Persons on the following Social Welfare
payments are provided with a Public Services Card with yellow &quot;FT&quot; in the top right-hand corner, which functions as a smart card in the same way as a Leap Card, but allows free travel:
* Pension (senior citizens over 66)
* Disability Allowance (persons with a disabling medical condition lasting longer than a year approved by a general practitioner, a departmental medical officer or a departmental welfare officer)
* Carers Allowance

Visitors from non-European countries to Ireland must pay full adult fare on buses, trams and trains regardless of their age or disability, and would thus be better off financially with a Leap Visitor Card set with the appropriate period pre-loaded (24 hours, 3 days, 7 days).

The free travel system was created by Ministerial Order (not an Act of the Oireachtas as with many such schemes) by then Minister for Health, Charles J Haughey in the late 1960s and is considered a &#x27;third rail&#x27; politically.

===Hours of operation and frequency===

Trams operate from 05:30 to 00:30 Monday to Friday. On Saturday services run from 06:30 to 00:30, while on Sundays it is only from 07:00 to 23:30. Public holidays are the same as Sundays, except trams run until 00:30. Services run at regular intervals, from every 4–5 minutes during peak times to every 15 minutes late at night.

During the Christmas season (from early December to the last weekend before Christmas), a night service runs on Luas during Friday and Saturday nights (as well as on New Year&#x27;s Eve), with the last trams departing the city centre at 03:30. However, fares are priced at a premium of €5 single (€4 on Leap Cards).

====Night Luas====
In 2016 while Dublin Bus was considering plans for the rolling out of its 24-hour bus service, a spokesperson for Transdev revealed that the company had looked at extending the Christmastime &#x27;Night Luas&#x27; to operate every weekend of the year, but that &quot;realistically, the demand for services is just not there [and that] the service just wouldn’t be financially viable.&quot;

In June 2022, Transport Minister Eamon Ryan asked the National Transport Authority to again re-examine the prospect of running Luas services on a 24-hour basis. The NTA responded by saying that a significant extension of the tram system was &quot;not something that should be progressed at this point&quot; noting that essential maintenance on the tram system - such as on its overhead cable systems, overhead line equipment and rail works - can only be carried out when all trams are out of service. The Authority pointed to its increased night bus services which have been coming online in recent years arguing that the delivery of 24-hour services across the bus network &quot;is more feasible&quot;. Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond pointed out that as well as more 24-hour Dublin Bus services, late-night Luas services are &quot;badly needed [..] given the persisting issues with access to taxis in Dublin city centre&quot;. &quot;This is becoming a public safety issue with many people being forced to walk home, often alone, late at night as public transport is not operating and taxis are hard to come by,&quot; he added.

===Accessibility===
The low floors and wide spaces of the Citadis trams mean that wheelchair users can easily board. All stops have also been designed with ramps, to allow easy access. Several have lifts, such as Kilmacud and Dundrum on the Green Line, while Connolly Station has escalators that connect the Luas stop to the main station building. The website for Luas also has an accessibility newsletter.

===Safety===

Before Luas was launched, a Safety Awareness Day was held in Dublin city centre. Thousands of reflective armbands were distributed to pedestrians and cyclists, in order to ensure their visibility for tram drivers. This policy seems to have worked as Luas has been described as being &quot;one of the safest transport systems in the world&quot;. Both trams and stops are monitored using CCTV 24 hours a day from the central control room, located in the Red Cow Depot.

Before Luas was launched, it was feared that the tram system would lead to a high number of fatal accidents. As of 2022, however, there have been approximately 10 fatalities. There have been many occurrences of cars striking trams, mainly caused by motorists breaking red lights. On 16 September 2009, a Luas collided with a Dublin Bus at the O&#x27;Connell Street-Abbey Street Junction. In the collision, 22 people were injured, three of them seriously, including the tram driver. Early investigations suggested that the bus had the green light to move, and that the Luas must have had technical problems. The Luas driver was later charged with dangerous driving, causing harm and operating a tram in a manner which posed risk to others. He was subsequently acquitted of dangerous conduct by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.

===Security===
Security on Luas trams, platforms and facilities is provided directly by Transdev. Luas Security Officers patrol the system to counter anti-social or other incidents, and intervene in incidents prior to the arrival of the Gardaí. Luas Security Officers wear tactical uniforms and stab-resistant body vests.

== Incidents and criticism==
There have been several incidents involving Luas, often leading to its temporary closure. As of September 2022, this included ten fatal incidents, with approximately 540 million passengers carried.

On 17 March 2012, a fire in buildings on Benburb Street resulted in Red Line services being suspended in the city centre until 24 March 2012. Other fires in buildings adjacent to the Red Line have led to shorter closures from time to time.

On 7 November 2013 a flash fire occurred on a tram as it approached Busáras stop. There were no injuries and the damage to the Tram was minor. There had been a similar fire in 2008.

Park and ride charges have also attracted criticism. As of 2022 the cost of parking for a full day is between €2 and €5. It was described by former government Teachta Dála and head of the Dáil transport Committee Eoin Ryan as &quot;unacceptable for Luas to charge passengers for parking at their Park and Ride facilities on top of ticket fares&quot;. On 8 February 2018 there were traffic delays in south Dublin because the longer 55 metre tram was too long for O&#x27;Connell bridge, when it was obstructed by a taxi blocking a junction.

In August 2021, the tweet, &quot;A long-term goal of mine has been to lead a disinformation campaign which claims that the Luas is free until enough people believe it that they have no choice but to give in and make the Luas is free,&quot; by journalist Carl Kinsella, resulted in a cascade of tweets, memes and posters improperly claiming the Luas was free of charge. The consequences of the effects of the Irish Twitter had to be dealt with by Luas&#x27; workers, Transdev issuing a statement to confirm that this is not the case and ticketless travellers face a €100 fine.

During the 2023 Dublin Riot, a Green Line tram was set alight on O&#x27;Connell St, causing &quot;extensive damage to overhead power line&quot; in the process, including on Westmoreland Street. The following day, Red Line services were unable to operate east of Smithfield, and Green Line services north of St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. The tram was towed back to Broombridge depot in the early afternoon.

=== Accidents and deaths ===
In February 2008, a 59-year-old man was struck by a tram at Cookstown Way in Tallaght, sustaining serious head injuries and dying in hospital the following day. In May 2009, a worker died at Citywest during the construction of the Luas A1 extension to Saggart.

In September 2009 a Red Line Luas tram and a double-decker number 16 Dublin Bus collided at the crossing of Abbey Street and O&#x27;Connell Street in central Dublin. The front section of the tram was derailed in the incident and the driver&#x27;s cabin was crushed flat against the left hand side of the bus. At least 21 people were injured and three were seriously hurt, including the driver of the tram who had to be cut out from the wreckage.

In October 2011, a 35-year-old Polish man, was struck and killed by a Red Line tram on Steevens Lane near Heuston Station. In June 2012, a 32-year-old woman was struck by a Luas tram in Inchicore, after falling onto the tracks at Blackhorse platform as a tram pulled in. She was caught between the platform and tram, and suffered severe head and body trauma. Emergency services managed to free her from under the tram, and the area was cordoned off for a forensic examination. She was rushed to hospital, and died of her injuries on 6 July 2012. As of 2019, she is the only Luas passenger (counted as a passenger, as she had intended to travel on the tram) to have died in a collision incident.

On 7 April 2014, a car collided with a Luas tram at the junction of Jervis Street and Abbey Street, and was caused to fatally strike a 35-year-old pedestrian from Dublin, who was pronounced dead at the scene. On 8 July 2017, a woman died after being struck by a city centre-bound Luas tram at St. James Walk, just past the Fatima stop, in Rialto. On 14 February 2019 a woman was struck and killed on a Tallaght bound tram between the Cookstown and Tallaght Hospital stops. She was pronounced dead at the scene. On 11 March 2019 a male pedestrian was struck and killed near the Kingswood stop. In December 2019, a male cyclist died in a collision with a tram at Peter&#x27;s Place.

In September 2022, a male pedestrian aged in his 50s died after he was struck by a tram between the Cabra and Broombridge stops.

=== Ransomware cyberattack ===
In January 2019 the website was compromised with a message threatening to &quot;publish all data and send emails to your users&quot; unless 1 Bitcoin was paid in five days.

Transdev took the site offline on Thursday 3 January 2019. At the time of the attack one bitcoin was worth €3,385. That afternoon they said that the records affected were those of people who had signed up to a Luas newsletter and that those people would be contacted in the next 24 hours to inform them of the breach. No financial records had been compromised. The Data Protection Commissioner and Garda National Economic Crime Bureau were both notified of the attack.

==Future==
In January 2023 the transport strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042 was published. It details four extensions to the existing LUAS system to be delivered in its term:
* Extension of the Green Line north to Finglas to be delivered in the medium term (2031-2036)
* New Line to Lucan (2031-2036)
* Extension of the Green Line south to Bray (2031-2036).
* Extension of the Red Line to Poolbeg to be delivered before 2042.

It also proposes up to 8 new lines and extensions, some previously proposed, to be delivered post-2042 with the NTA to &quot;undertake detailed appraisal, planning and design work&quot; in that 20 year time frame. Those lines are: 
# City Centre to Clongriffin
# City Centre to Beaumont and Balgriffin
# Green Line Extension to Tyrrelstown
# City Centre to Blanchardstown
# Red Line Reconfiguration to provide the following lines:
## Clondalkin-City Centre; 
## Tallaght-Kimmage-City Centre. 
# Tallaght to City Centre via Knocklyon; 
# Green Line Reconfiguration to provide the following lines:
## City Centre to Bray via UCD and Sandyford
## Sandyford to City Centre
## Sandyford to Cherrywood via Foxrock (suggested but unconfirmed)

The plan also examines the potential for an orbital LUAS, declaring that its alignment(s) should be specified and protected in the later half of the plan. Other upgrades to the system such as new stops, expanded depots, and improved security are also mentioned.

===Other proposed lines and extensions===

*Line F1/2 – City Centre to Lucan. On 27 September 2007, Noel Dempsey (Minister for Transport) launched the public consultation process for the planned Luas line to Lucan. Two main route options where identified, with a number of sub-options also identified. It was expected that would link with the proposed Metro West. The preferred route was announced in November 2008 and the RPA where planning the precise alignment and station and depot locations. The planning for the two lines was split in two. Line F1 was to be the line from Lucan to where it will connect with the existing red line at Blackhorse and Line F2 will be where the line was to leave the existing red line at James and continue on to College Green.

*Luas Finglas – A extension from Broombridge through Finglas to Charlestown Shopping Centre was announced in 2020, with a possible operating date of 2028. A public consultation was launched in July 2020. In November 2021, RTÉ News reported that the line would not be complete . In October 2024, The Irish Times reported that Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan would be seeking cabinet approval for the completion of the line before 2031.
*Line B2 – Cherrywood to Bray environs extension (Green Line). This is a proposed extension of . On 6 June 2007, the route of this Luas extension was announced. It is proposed to run from Brides Glen to Fassaroe and Bray (adjacent to the DART station), and will run very close to the M11 motorway, eventually crossing it near the Wilford interchange. This extension was postponed in 2009 due to the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn, and while it has been proposed again in the decade since, as of October 2020, Minister Ryan confirmed the extension will not commence in the short term, but could be proposed in the future after the extension to Finglas.

===Rejected projects===
*Line E – In May 2008, the feasibility study for a possible Luas line E, to run from Dundrum to the City Centre via Rathfarnham, Terenure and Harold&#x27;s Cross, was completed. The line was found to be feasible and it was submitted to the Minister for Transport but was rejected on being found uneconomic to operate.

===Other projects===
Following the introduction of Luas in Dublin, there is support to bring trams to other Irish cities. During the 2007 election campaign, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party both announced plans for tram systems in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Bray. The 2007 Programme for Government between these two parties and the Progressive Democrats included feasibility studies on these projects within the first two years of the government. Cork and Limerick were expected to complete their studies by &quot;mid 2009&quot;. As a result of the financial crisis beginning in 2008, a moratorium was placed on future capital projects; as such, no feasibility studies have been completed as of 2017.

In 2018 a revived campaign for a Galway LUAS or &quot;GLUAS&quot; was launched receiving support Independent TD Catherine Connolly. The campaign claims a 21 km very light rail line with trains every five minutes could be installed for as little as €200 million, and make a major contribution to reducing Galway&#x27;s traffic. The denial of planning permission for the Galway&#x27;s second ring-road in 2022 is likely to add pressure to solve the area&#x27;s traffic problems.

In May 2019, plans were revealed for a Luas-style system in Cork. The system would consist of a long line with 25 stops from Ballincollig to Mahon Point.

<doc id="692929" wikidata="Q223020" url="?curid=692929" title="3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine">
<text>3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is an empathogen-entactogen, stimulant, and psychedelic drug of the amphetamine family that is encountered mainly as a recreational drug. In its pharmacology, MDA is a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). In most countries, the drug is a controlled substance and its possession and sale are illegal.

MDA is rarely sought as a recreational drug compared to other amphetamines; however, it remains widely used due to it being a primary metabolite, the product of hepatic N-dealkylation, of MDMA. It is also a common adulterant of illicitly produced MDMA.

==Uses==

===Medical===
MDA currently has no accepted medical use.

===Recreational===
MDA is bought, sold, and used as a recreational drug due to its enhancement of mood and empathy. A recreational dose of MDA is sometimes cited as being between 100 and 160 mg. It produces MDMA-like effects, including entactogen and psychedelic effects.

==Side effects==
Side effects of MDA include sympathomimetic effects like increased heart rate and blood pressure as well as increased cortisol and prolactin levels.

==Overdose==
Symptoms of acute toxicity may include agitation, sweating, increased blood pressure and heart rate, dramatic increase in body temperature, convulsions, and death. Death is usually caused by cardiac effects and subsequent hemorrhaging in the brain (stroke).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===


MDA is a substrate of the serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and vesicular monoamine transporters, and in relation to this, acts as a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (that is, it is an ). It is also an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors and shows affinity for the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors.

The (&quot;S&quot;)-optical isomer of MDA is more potent than the (&quot;R&quot;)-optical isomer as a psychostimulant, possessing greater affinity for the three monoamine transporters.

In terms of the subjective and behavioral effects of MDA, it is thought that serotonin release is required for its empathogenic effects, dopamine release is required for its euphoriant (rewarding and addictive) effects, dopamine and norepinephrine release is required for its psychostimulant effects, and direct agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is required for its mild psychedelic effects.

In addition to its actions as a monoamine releasing agent, MDA is a potent high-efficacy partial agonist or full agonist of the rodent TAAR1. Conversely, MDA is much weaker in terms of potency as an agonist of the human TAAR1. Moreover, MDA acts as a very weak partial agonist or antagonist of the human TAAR1 rather than as an efficacious agonist. TAAR1 activation is thought to auto-inhibit and constrain the effects of amphetamines that act as TAAR1 agonists, for instance MDMA in rodents.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The pharmacokinetics of MDA have been studied. Its duration of action has been reported to be about 6 to 8hours. The duration of MDA is longer than that of MDMA, about 8hours for MDA versus 6hours for MDMA. The elimination half-life of MDA is 10.9hours. Differences in the duration of MDA versus MDMA may be due pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.

==Chemistry==
MDA is a substituted methylenedioxylated phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. In relation to other phenethylamines and amphetamines, it is the 3,4-methylenedioxy, α-methyl derivative of β-phenylethylamine, the 3,4-methylenedioxy derivative of amphetamine, and the &quot;N&quot;-desmethyl derivative of MDMA.

===Synonyms===
In addition to &quot;3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine&quot;, MDA is also known by other chemical synonyms such as the following:

* α-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-β-phenylethylamine
* 1-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-propanamine
* 1-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-propanamine

===Synthesis===
MDA is typically synthesized from essential oils such as safrole or piperonal. Common approaches from these precursors include:

* Reaction of safrole&#x27;s alkene functional group with a halogen containing mineral acid followed by amine alkylation.

* Wacker oxidation of safrole to yield 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylpropan-2-one (MDP2P) followed by reductive amination or via reduction of its oxime.
* Henry reaction of piperonal with nitroethane followed by nitro compound reduction.
*Darzens reaction on heliotropin was also done by J. Elks, et al. This gives MDP2P, which was then subjected to a Leuckart reaction.
* The &quot;two dogs&quot; or &quot;dopeboy&quot; clandestine method, starting with helional as a precursor. First, an oxime is created using hydoxylamine. Then, a Beckmann rearrangement is performed with nickel acetate to form the amide. Then a Hofmann rearrangement is done to form the freebase amine of MDA. Then it is purified with an acid base extraction.

===Detection in body fluids===
MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDA and major metabolites of MDMA, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.

===Derivatives===
MDA constitutes part of the core structure of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist protokylol.

==History==
MDA was first synthesized by Carl Mannich and W. Jacobsohn in 1910. It was first ingested in July 1930 by Gordon Alles who later licensed the drug to Smith, Kline &amp; French. MDA was first used in animal tests in 1939, and human trials began in 1941 in the exploration of possible therapies for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. From 1949 to 1957, more than five hundred human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as an antidepressant and/or anorectic by Smith, Kline &amp; French. The United States Army also experimented with the drug, code named EA-1298, while working to develop a truth drug or incapacitating agent. Harold Blauer died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected, without his knowledge or consent, with 450 mg of the drug as part of Project MKUltra. MDA was patented as an ataractic by Smith, Kline &amp; French in 1960, and as an anorectic under the trade name &quot;Amphedoxamine&quot; in 1961. MDA began to appear on the recreational drug scene around 1963 to 1964. It was then inexpensive and readily available as a research chemical from several scientific supply houses. Several researchers, including Claudio Naranjo and Richard Yensen, have explored MDA in the field of psychotherapy.

The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) &quot;tenamfetamine&quot; was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986. It was recommended in the same published list in which the INN of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), brolamfetamine, was recommended. These events suggest that MDA and DOB were under development as potential pharmaceutical drugs at the time. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was also founded in 1986.

==Society and culture==
===Name===
When MDA was under development as a potential pharmaceutical drug, it was given the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of &quot;tenamfetamine&quot;.

===Legal status===
====Australia====
MDA is schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standards. A schedule 9 substance is listed as a &quot;Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.&quot;

====United States====
MDA is a Schedule I controlled substance in the US.

==Research==
In 2010, the ability of MDA to invoke mystical experiences and alter vision in healthy volunteers was studied. The study concluded that MDA is a &quot;potential tool to investigate mystical experiences and visual perception&quot;.

A 2019 double-blind study administered both MDA and MDMA to healthy volunteers. The study found that MDA shared many properties with MDMA including entactogenic and stimulant effects, but generally lasted longer and produced greater increases in psychedelic-like effects like complex imagery, synesthesia, and spiritual experiences.

===Adverse effects===
MDA can produce serotonergic neurotoxic effects in rodents, which might in part be due to transformation into MDA followed by subsequent metabolism. In addition, MDA activates a response of the neuroglia, though this subsides after use.

<doc id="692930" wikidata="Q270204" url="?curid=692930" title="Nalo Hopkinson">
<text>Nalo Hopkinson (born 20 December 1960) is a Jamaican-born Canadian speculative fiction writer and editor. Her novels – &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; (1998), &quot;Midnight Robber&quot; (2000), &quot;The Salt Roads&quot; (2003), &quot;The New Moon&#x27;s Arms&quot; (2007) – and short stories such as those in her collection &quot;Skin Folk&quot; (2001) often draw on Caribbean history and language, and its traditions of oral and written storytelling.

Hopkinson has edited two fiction anthologies: &quot;Whispers from the Cotton Tree Root: Caribbean Fabulist Fiction&quot; and &quot;&quot;. She was the co-editor with Uppinder Mehan of the 2004 anthology &quot;So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Visions of the Future&quot;, and with Geoff Ryman co-edited &quot;Tesseracts 9&quot;.

Hopkinson defended George Elliott Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Whylah Falls&quot; on the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads 2002&quot;. She was the curator of &quot;Six Impossible Things&quot;, an audio series of Canadian fantastical fiction on CBC Radio One.

As of 2021, she lives and teaches in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2020, Hopkinson was named the 37th Damon Knight Grand Master, in recognition of &quot;lifetime achievement in science fiction and/or fantasy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Nalo Hopkinson was born 20 December 1960 in Kingston, Jamaica, to Freda and Abdur Rahman Slade Hopkinson. She grew up in Guyana, Trinidad, and Canada. She was raised in a literary environment; her mother was a library technician and her father a Guyanese poet, playwright and actor who also taught English and Latin. By virtue of this upbringing, Hopkinson had access to writers such as Derek Walcott during her formative years, and could read Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s works by the age of six. Hopkinson&#x27;s writing is influenced by the fairy and folk tales she read at a young age, among which were the Afro-Caribbean stories about Anansi, as well as Western works including &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;; she was also known to have read the works of Shakespeare around the time she was reading Homer. Though she lived briefly in Connecticut in the U.S. during her father&#x27;s tenure at Yale University, Hopkinson has said that the culture shock from her move to Toronto from Guyana at the age of 16 was something &quot;to which [she&#x27;s] still not fully reconciled&quot;. She lived in Toronto from 1977 to 2011, before moving to Riverside, California, where she works as Professor of Creative Writing at University of California, Riverside.

Hopkinson has a Master of Arts degree in Writing Popular Fiction from Seton Hill University, where she studied with her mentor and instructor, science fiction writer James Morrow. She has learning disabilities.

==Career==
Before working as a professor, Hopkinson held jobs in libraries, worked as a government culture research officer, and held the position of grants officer at the Toronto Arts Council. She has taught writing at various programs around the world, including stints as writer-in-residence at Clarion East, Clarion West and Clarion South. Publishing and writing was stopped for six years due to a serious illness that prevented her from working. Severe anemia, caused by fibroids as well as a vitamin D deficiency, led to financial difficulties and ultimately homelessness for two years prior to being hired by UC Riverside.

In 2011, Hopkinson was hired as an associate professor in creative writing with an emphasis on science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism at University of California, Riverside. She became a full professor in 2014.

As an author, Hopkinson often uses themes of Caribbean folklore, Afro-Caribbean culture, and feminism. She is historically conscious and uses knowledge from growing up in Caribbean communities in her writing, including the use of Creole and character backgrounds from Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Jamaica. In addition, Hopkinson consistently writes about subjects including race, class, and sexuality. Through her work, particularly in &quot;Midnight Robber&quot;, Hopkinson addresses differences in cultures as well as social issues such as child and sexual abuse.

Hopkinson has been a key speaker and guest of honor at multiple science fiction conventions. She is one of the founding members of the Carl Brandon Society and serves on the board.

Hopkinson&#x27;s favorite writers include Samuel R. Delany, Tobias Buckell, and Charles R. Saunders. In addition, inspiration for her novels often comes from songs or poems with Christina Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;Goblin Market&quot; serving as the inspiration for &quot;Sister Mine&quot;. Personal hobbies include sewing, cooking, gardening, and fabric design. Hopkinson designs fabrics based on historical photos and illustrations.
== Awards and recognition ==
Hopkinson was the recipient of the 1999 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the Ontario Arts Council Foundation Award for Emerging Writers.

&quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1998, and received the Locus Award for Best First Novel. In 2008, it was a finalist in Canada Reads, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

&quot;Midnight Robber&quot; was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Memorial Award in 2000 and nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2001.

&quot;Skin Folk&quot; received the World Fantasy Award and the Sunburst Award in 2003.

&quot;The Salt Roads&quot; received the Gaylactic Spectrum Award for positive exploration of queer issues in speculative fiction for 2004, presented at the 2005 Gaylaxicon. It was also nominated for the 2004 Nebula Award for Best Novel.

In 2008, &quot;The New Moon&#x27;s Arms&quot; received the Aurora Award and the Sunburst Award, making her the first author to receive the Sunburst Award twice. This book was also nominated for the 2007 Nebula Award for Best Novel.

In 2016, Hopkinson received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Anglia Ruskin University. In 2020, she was named the 37th Damon Knight Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. In 2022, her &quot;Broad Dutty Water: A Sunken Story&quot; was awarded the Theodore Sturgeon Award.

<text>James Vincent Hall (born January 2, 1968, in Harris County, Texas, United States) is an American rock singer and guitarist, best known for his gothic-style lyrics, distinctive voice, avant-garde performances and eclectic compositions.

== Early career – Mary My Hope and solo==
Before launching his solo career in 1990, James Hall was the singer for Atlanta band, Mary My Hope, which released one album entitled &quot;Museum&quot; in 1989, and one EP, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Kings&quot;, both on RCA/Silvertone. An expanded version of Suicide Kings appeared at the same time, called &quot;Monster Is Bigger Than The Man&quot;. This contained, in addition to the unreleased material and Museum album cuts, two live tracks recorded at the Princess Charlotte in Leicester, England. In 1993, Hall&#x27;s &quot;My Love, Sex, and Spirit&quot; was put out by Daemon Records, Indigo Girl Amy Ray&#x27;s co-op effort. Three singles were released from &quot;My Love, Sex, and Spirit&quot;, each containing non-album tracks. Subsequently, he signed to Geffen Records, and in 1996 his album, &quot;Pleasure Club&quot;, was released. In 1994, he contributed a trumpet part to the songs &quot;Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Touch Me Fall&quot;, from the Indigo Girls&#x27; album, &quot;Swamp Ophelia&quot;.

== Pleasure Club ==
In 2002, Hall appeared with a new band named Pleasure Club. This band featured Hall on vocals and guitar, Michael Jerome on drums, Grant Curry on bass, and Marc Hutner also on guitar. They released three albums, &quot;Here Comes The Trick&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; and the last &quot;Scatter Rose&quot; (2020). &quot;Here Comes The Trick&quot; was later re-released as a double with a live album entitled &quot;Live: Out of the Pulpit&quot; accompanying it. Pleasure Club have since disbanded, and Hall has returned to his solo work.

== The Futura Bold ==
After the disbanding of Pleasure Club and the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina receded, Hall was in Atlanta, Georgia. Multi-instrumentalists Chris Piskun and Bruce Butkovich joined James during what was to be his third solo record, yet ultimately morphed into a new entity christened, The Futura Bold. The Futura Bold released a CD called &quot;The Futura Bold&quot; on March 23, 2010 featuring Jimmy Gnecco of the band Ours on background vocals on &quot; Consenting Adults&quot;, &quot;Evil Twin&quot; and &quot;Good Times&quot;.

== Other projects ==
In 1997, James toured with Brad, playing guitar and keyboards in support of their &quot;Interiors&quot; album.

Hall has formed a working relationship with singer Jimmy Gnecco of the band Ours, and is featured on the third Ours album, &quot;Mercy (Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy)&quot;.

He also is the lead singer of the Aristocrats, a recent project started by Hall, Darren Dodd, and Dropsonic&#x27;s Dan Dixon and Dave Chase.

Currently James Hall performs with his touring band called &quot;James Hall and the Ladies of Music&quot;.

<doc id="692944" wikidata="Q558197" url="?curid=692944" title="Cearl of Mercia">
<text>Cearl (or Ceorl) was an early king of Mercia who ruled during the early part of the 7th century, until about 626. He is the first Mercian king mentioned by Bede in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. Bede was a Northumbrian who was hostile to Mercia, and historian Robin Fleming speculates that as &quot;ceorl&quot; means &quot;rustic&quot; in Old English, his name may have been a joke.

Cearl&#x27;s ancestry is unknown. He is not included in the Mercian royal genealogy; Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century placed him as ruling after Pybba, saying that he was not Pybba&#x27;s son but was his kinsman.

Bede (2.14) mentions him only in passing, as the father-in-law of Edwin of Deira.
According to Bede, Edwin married Cwenburh (Quenberga), daughter of &quot;Cearl, king of the Mercians&quot; while he was in exile, and with her had two sons, Osfrith and Eadfrith.
Historians have noted the marriage as evidence for Cearl&#x27;s independence from the then-Northumbrian king Æthelfrith, since Edwin was Æthelfrith&#x27;s rival and Cearl would not have married his daughter to an enemy of his overlord. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; credits the later king Penda with first separating the Mercians from the Northumbrians, but if Cearl was able to make this marriage to Æthelfrith&#x27;s enemy he must not have been subject to him—possibly any subject relationship only developed at a later date. The historian D. P. Kirby speculated that perhaps Cearl was enabled to marry his daughter to Edwin due to the protection of the powerful East Anglian king Raedwald, and that Edwin&#x27;s subsequent exile among the East Angles may have been due to Æthelfrith&#x27;s power beginning &quot;to impinge on Cearl or his successors among the Mercians&quot;.

It has been suggested that Cearl&#x27;s kingship suffered a catastrophe between the time of the Battle of Chester around 616 and the appearance of his successor, Penda, son of Pybba. It is possible that Cearl may have been involved in that conflict, which may have effectively ended his overkingship of Mercia until the rise of Penda.

Whether Cearl reigned until Penda became king is unknown. Penda was in power by 633 (and possibly by 626, if the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is correct). It is also unknown what relationship Cearl had to Penda, if any. That Cearl married his daughter to Edwin could be evidence that he and Penda were rivals, since Penda later fought against and defeated Edwin (in alliance with Cadwallon of Gwynedd).

More evidence could be seen for a dynastic rivalry between Cearl and Penda in Penda&#x27;s later execution (according to Bede) of Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin who was Cearl&#x27;s grandson through Cwenburh. Although Penda&#x27;s reason is unknown, the killing of Eadfrith is often seen as the result of pressure from the Northumbrian king Oswald, to whom Eadfrith would have represented a threat; it is, however, also possible that Penda may have decided that Eadfrith&#x27;s lineage made him unsuitable for use as a puppet against Oswald, since he would represent a threat to Penda&#x27;s own position through his descent from Cearl.

<doc id="692953" wikidata="Q888634" url="?curid=692953" title="Ceolwulf I of Mercia">
<text>Ceolwulf I was the King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 821 until his deposition in 823. He was the brother of Coenwulf, his predecessor, and was deposed by Beornwulf.

William of Malmesbury declared that, after Cœnwulf: &quot;the kingdom of the Mercians declining, and if I may use the expression, nearly lifeless, produced nothing worthy of historical commemoration.&quot; Actually, Mercia did have a moment of glory that William was unaware of. Indicating the year 822, the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; states: &quot;The fortress of Degannwy (in Gwynedd) is destroyed by the Saxons and they took the kingdom of Powys into their own control.&quot;
A later charter depicts a disturbed state of affairs during Ceolwulf&#x27;s reign: &quot;After the death of Cœnwulf, king of the Mercians, many disagreements and innumerable disputes arose among leading persons of every kind—kings, bishops, and ministers of the churches of God—concerning all manner of secular affairs&quot;. In 823, sometime after 26 May, on which date he granted land to Archbishop Wulfred in exchange for a gold and silver vessel, Ceolwulf was overthrown. His replacement was Beornwulf, whose pedigree is not known.

Ceolwulf ruled Kent directly—in his two charters, he is styled as &quot;King of the Mercians and of the men of Kent&quot;.

==Family==
Ceolwulf was the son of Cuthberht of Mercia and the brother of Coenwulf of Mercia (d. 821) and Cuthred of Kent (d. 807).
Coenwulf ruled as king of Mercia from 796 until his death in 821. In 798 Coenwulf installed his brother Cuthred as king of Kent in 798. Cuthred ruled there until his death in 807, after which Kent reverted to Mercia. Upon Coenwulf&#x27;s death in 821 he was succeeded by Ceolwulf.

The name of Ceolwulf&#x27;s wife is not recorded; however, they had one known child, a daughter: Ælfflæd of Mercia.

According to a tradition preserved at Evesham, Ceolwulf&#x27;s daughter Ælfflæd married Wigmund, the son of Wiglaf, King of Mercia (827–839). Wiglaf was succeeded by Beorhtwulf and his son Berhtfrith sought to marry King Wigmund&#x27;s widow so that he could become king. This was opposed by Wigstan, the son of Wigmund and Ælfflæd, and Berhtfrith slew Wigstan in 849. However, there is no record outside this Evesham tradition that Wigmund was ever king. Alfred Smyth suggests that Ceolwulf II, who became king following the Viking expulsion of King Burgred in 874, may have been another son of Ælfflæd, and thus a grandson of Ceolwulf I.

<doc id="692955" wikidata="Q547462" url="?curid=692955" title="Milanese dialect">
<text>Milanese (endonym in traditional orthography , ) is the central variety of the Western dialect of the Lombard language spoken in Milan, the rest of its metropolitan city, and the northernmost part of the province of Pavia. Milanese, due to the importance of Milan, the largest city in Lombardy, is often considered one of the most prestigious Lombard variants and the most prestigious one in the Western Lombard area.

In Italian-language contexts, Milanese (like most indigenous Romance varieties spoken in Italy other than standard Italian) is often called a &quot;dialect&quot;. This can be misunderstood to mean a variety of the Tuscan-derived national language, which it is not. Lombard in general, including Milanese, is a sister language of Tuscan, thus also of Italian, rather than a derivative. Typologically, Lombard is a Western Romance language, and more closely resembles other Gallo-Italic languages in Northern Italy (e.g. Piedmontese, Ligurian, Emilian, Romagnol) as well as others further afield, including Occitan and Romansh. 

Milanese has an extensive literature, reaching as far back as the 13th century and including the works of important writers such as Bonvesin da la Riva (mid 13th century–1313), Carlo Maria Maggi (1630–1699) Carlo Porta (1775–1821). In addition to the large literary corpus, various dictionaries, a few grammar books and a recent translation of the Gospels are available in the language.

== Distribution ==

The Milanese dialect as commonly defined today is essentially concentrated around Milan and its metropolitan city, reaching into the northernmost part of the province of Pavia. Subdialects of Milanese – also known as – are spoken in the western part of the province (Castano Primo, Turbigo, Abbiategrasso, Magenta), the eastern part (Gorgonzola, Cassina de&#x27; Pecchi, Cernusco sul Naviglio, Segrate, Bellinzago), the parts to the north of the Naviglio Martesana (Carugate, Cassano d&#x27;Adda, Inzago, Gessate), certain areas where the dialect becomes transitional (between Saronno and Rho), the southern parts (Binasco and Melegnano), and the northern parts of the Province of Pavia (north of the line between Bereguardo and Landriano, which includes places such as Trovo and Casorate Primo).

Historically, up to the late 19th century, &quot;Milanese&quot; was also used to define the dialects spoken in Brianza and in the areas of Varese () and Lecco (); less commonly it was also used to cover the whole Western Lombard dialect area, which had in Milanese its most prestigious variety.

== Orthography ==
As Milanese, like the Lombard language as a whole, is not an officially recognized language anywhere, there have been many different orthographic conventions, including pan-Lombard proposals (like the orthography), and conventions limited to Western Lombard (the &quot;Unified Insubric Orthography&quot;). The &quot;de facto&quot; standard for Milanese, though, is the literary classical Milanese orthography ().

Classical Milanese orthography is the oldest orthographic convention still in use and it is the one used by all writers of Milanese literature, most famously by Carlo Porta. The trigraph (sometimes written ), used to represent the phoneme, is considered the most distinctive feature of this standard. Since the latter half of the 20th century, as a consequence of the Italianization of Lombardy with the Lombard language ceasing to be the main language of daily use in Milan, the Classical orthography has been contested and lost ground as Italian speakers often find it counterintuitive. Classical Milanese orthography, which often reflects etymology, has indeed many words closely resembling their Italian cognates, but pronunciation is often different, one of the most striking examples being orthographic doubled consonants which represent geminates in Italian but a short preceding vowel (if stressed syllable) in Milanese: compare Italian (dear) and (cart) with its Milanese cognates and .

== Example ==
===English===
Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

<text>Ludeca or Ludica was the King of Mercia from 826 to 827. He became king after the death of Beornwulf in battle against the rebellious East Angles, but he too was killed in another failed attempt to subjugate them in the following year.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; simply states that Ludeca &quot;was slain, and his five Ealdormen with him&quot;, but Florence of Worcester (who, incidentally, carries the same two-year error as the earlier &#x27;Chronicles&#x27; - both place this event in 825 instead of 827) fleshes out the story: &quot;Ludecan, king of the Mercians, mustered his forces and led an army into the province of the East Angles, for the purpose of taking vengeance for the death of king Beornulf, his predecessor. He was quickly met by the natives and their king, who in a severe battle slew him and five of his Ealdormen, and very many of his troops, and put to flight the remainder. Wiglaf succeeded to his splendid kingdom.&quot;

Prior to Ludeca&#x27;s rule, he was mentioned in two charters from 824 as a &quot;dux&quot; under Beornwulf. The Fitzwilliam Museum also holds a silver penny minted during Ludeca&#x27;s reign, thought to have been minted at Ipswich by a moneyer named Wærbeald.

In 2016, a coin establishing Ludeca&#x27;s rule over London in 826 was found. Prior to the discovery, it had been thought that Wessex took London from the Mercians at the Battle of Ellandun in 825.

<text>A match referee is an official appointed to oversee professional cricket matches. Match referees for Test matches and One Day Internationals are appointed by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Most matches below international level do not have a referee.

The match referee&#x27;s responsibility is to ensure that the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct is upheld during the game, to assess any breaches of the Code, and to hand out penalties for any breaches. Following every game, the match referee composes and submits a match report to the ICC, noting any events or actions by players or umpires that may be a concern in terms of the Code of Conduct or the Laws of Cricket, and giving ratings to the quality of the pitch.

The match referee remains off the field of play at all times during the actual play of the game, observing events from a spectator area. The referee makes no decisions regarding play; such decisions are the sole responsibility of the appointed umpires.

Match referees are frequently former cricket players who have had distinguished careers on the field. Some notable match referees include 
Ranjan Madugalle, Chris Broad, Jeff Crowe, David Boon and Javagal Srinath.

In recent years the law regarding throwing - the unlawful delivery of the cricket ball by a bowler because of straightening of the arm at the elbow - has been interpreted as the domain of the match referee and a system of reports to the ICC, rather than a matter for the umpires to decide as a no-ball at each incidence on the field. This de facto migration of responsibility has caused controversy, with some commentators claiming it has eroded the official support and authority owed to the umpires.

<text>Wigstan (, ; died c. 840 AD), also known as Saint Wystan, was the son of Wigmund of Mercia and Ælfflæd, daughter of King Ceolwulf I of Mercia.

==History==
Like many Mercians of the period very little is known about Wigstan. He was the son of Wigmund and Ælfflæd, both the offspring of Mercian kings, Wiglaf and Ceolwulf I respectively. Wigmund, according to the Croyland Chronicle, died of dysentery before his father King Wiglaf, making Wigstan heir to the kingdom of Mercia. However, when Wiglaf died c.839, Wigstan declined the kingship preferring religious life and monastic orders instead. Beorhtwulf, possibly Wigstan&#x27;s great-uncle, became king instead. William of Malmesbury claims that Beorhtwulf&#x27;s son, Beorhtfrith, wished to marry Wigstan&#x27;s widowed mother, Ælfflæd, but Wigstan forbade the union as they were too closely related. As revenge Beorhtfrith went to visit the young King ostensibly in peace but, when the two greeted each other, he struck Wigstan on the head with the shaft of his dagger and his servant ran him through with his sword.

==Veneration==
The site of Wigstan&#x27;s martyrdom has been variously claimed to be Wistanstow, Shropshire, and Wistow, Leicestershire, with Wigston being the nearest town which happens to be derived from his name. 

Wigston was one of the places where the body of St Wigstan remained overnight on the way to Repton for burial. A small shrine was set up to honour him, which became the site of an annual pilgrimage on the saint&#x27;s feast day. It was replaced by a chapel in 1086, which, in turn was replaced by a church, now closed.

Wigstan became a famous saint and Repton became a centre of pilgrimage as a result, which led Cnut the Great to move Wigstan&#x27;s relics to Evesham, where the was written by Dominic of Evesham, a medieval prior there.

The saint&#x27;s relics were relocated to the Abbey at Evesham. His &quot;vita&quot; (meaning &quot;life&quot;, a history recording reputed acts of sanctity) has been attributed to the Benedictine chronicler Dominic of Evesham, an early 12th-century Prior at Evesham. The edifice of the abbey (including the tomb of the four saints and many monastic buildings) were demolished during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Noted Edwardian artist Margaret E.A. Rope was commissioned for the windows in the parish church of Wistanstow in Shropshire dedicated depicting SS Wistan and Anne.
==St Wistan’s Way==
St Wistan’s Way is a four-mile pilgrimage starting at the medieval church of St. Wistan&#x27;s in Wistow and proceeding over the Grand Union Canal to Wigston.

<doc id="692975" wikidata="Q448940" url="?curid=692975" title="Allegheny National Forest">
<text>The Allegheny National Forest is a National Forest in Northwestern Pennsylvania, about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. The forest covers of land. Within the forest is Kinzua Dam, which impounds the Allegheny River to form Allegheny Reservoir. The administrative headquarters for the Allegheny National Forest is in Warren. The Allegheny National Forest has two ranger stations, one in Marienville, Forest County, and the other in Bradford, McKean County.

The Allegheny National Forest lies in the heart of Pennsylvania&#x27;s oil and gas region. It is only from the site of the first commercial oil well in the United States at Titusville, Pennsylvania. In 1981, about 17 percent of the state&#x27;s crude oil production came from mineral rights owned by private individuals within the Forest boundary.

==History before 1923==
Today the Allegheny Plateau is known for black cherry, maple and other hardwoods, but two hundred years ago these species were less numerous. Today&#x27;s forest is largely the result of two things: the exploitation of timber at the turn of the 20th century and being managed by the Forest Service since 1923.

===18th century===
In the 18th century, the forest in northwest Pennsylvania was mostly Eastern Hemlock and American beech. Sugar maple, birch, chestnut, white pine, white oak and red maple were also common. White pine occurred in the original forest in relatively small, well-defined areas where it was typically accompanied by chestnut and to a lesser degree oak. Black cherry accounted for less than one percent of the plateau&#x27;s trees. This old-growth forest contained rich, vibrant biodiversity, and was characterized by large trees, fallen logs, and a multi-layered forest canopy. Predation by the native eastern wolf (&quot;Canis lupus lycaon&quot;) and eastern cougar (&quot;Puma concolor couguar&quot;) kept deer populations at naturally regulated low levels, estimated at ten deer per square mile. The understory vegetation was dense and richly diverse.

Disturbances such as tornado, blowdown, and ice storms were common events that created a random mosaic of small openings in the forest canopy across the landscape before human beings arrived to the North American continent. Later, Native Americans burned small areas of the understory of the forest in locations to improve berry and oak mast production, hunting, and ease of travel.

=== Early colonization ===
European settlers reached this area in the early 19th century. At first, trees were cut mostly to clear land for agriculture and provide timber for cabins and barns. Soon, the first commercial water-powered mills cut small amounts of lumber from selected pine, hemlock and large hardwoods. By 1840, portable steam engines made circular sawmills practical, and mills that could process 10,000 board feet (24 m³) of lumber per day were common.

Tanneries that used hemlock bark as their source of tannin for curing leather began to appear in the late 1850s. This infant industry received a great boost by the Civil War demand for harness, military equipment and industrial belting. By the end of the century, the tanning industry was a major forest industry in Pennsylvania that used huge quantities of hemlock bark. The logs were removed later and sawn into lumber products.

===1850 to 1900===
Between 1850 and 1900, American society and technology changed in dramatic ways. People, moving West and in the growing cities in the East, demanded lumber to build homes, stores and furniture. Demand for paper and other wood pulp products increased. An eightyfold increase in coal production led to the need for more lumber for mine props, timbers, and planks. Band saws came into use after 1880, making possible the construction of huge mills capable of sawing or more of lumber per day. Railroads provided convenient transportation to consumers and markets. They also opened up extensive and previously inaccessible areas of timber with specialized locomotives such as the Shay which could traverse steep hillsides, uneven tracks and sharp curves. All of these factors supported large sawmill and tannery industries.

===20th century===
By 1900, deer and their predators were almost eliminated due to overhunting. The Pennsylvania Game Commission began to restore the deer herd by importing deer from other states.

A new enterprise, the wood chemical industry, changed the course of forest development. Between 1890 and 1930, wood chemical plants produced charcoal, methanol, acetic acid, acetate of lime and similar products, and provided a market for virtually every size, species and quality of tree growing on the Allegheny Plateau. Harvests during this era were the most complete ever made in the area, clearing nearly every accessible tree of every size. The once vast forest of the Allegheny Plateau was almost completely removed, leaving barren hillsides as far as the eye could see.

Many large forest landowners in Pennsylvania and other northeastern states simply abandoned the land and moved West in search of new forests. The land left behind often ended up on delinquent tax rolls, prompting a financial crisis for rural counties. The bare soil and logging slash made floods and wildfires a constant danger.

==== 1911 ====
In 1911, the United States Congress passed the Weeks Act, allowing the federal government to buy land in eastern states for the establishment of National Forests. The Allegheny National Forest was established in 1923.

But with low deer populations, a new forest quickly grew. This forest was different from the previous one because conditions were now different. Shade-tolerant, long-lived trees like hemlock and beech gave way to sun-loving, shorter-lived species like black cherry, which readily germinated on the bare sunny ground. Cherry, red maple, black birch, and sugar maple became common species in the understory.

Today many of the Eastern National Forests are primarily second-growth and different in character from National Forests in the West created from huge reserves of largely virgin forest. In the Allegheny National Forest, the trees are roughly the same age because they started growing about the same time and the Forest Service continues to manage the land through a silvicultural system known as even-aged management—a practice very closely related to clearcutting.

==History after 1923==
An old-growth forest of hemlock and beech once stretched along northern Pennsylvania, but heavy logging between 1890 and 1930 left only pockets of that early forest in places like Hearts Content. Since the Forest Service began to manage the Allegheny National Forest in 1923, a different forest of hardwood trees like black cherry (that are more valuable as a timber product) was established through the use of herbicides and selective fertilizing. This weeded out the &quot;undesirable&quot; native trees while allowing the black cherry tree to thrive.

The Forest Service brought new concepts in forest management to the Allegheny Plateau, multiple benefits and sustainability. The Organic Act of 1897 introduced the National Forest mission: to improve the forest, provide favorable conditions for water flows, and furnish a continuous supply of timber to meet people&#x27;s needs. On these lands, seedlings for tomorrow&#x27;s forest are the focus of forest management activities. Watersheds are managed to ensure clear water for fisheries like trout and clean drinking water for all.

===Conservation===
Over time, various laws added other benefits like wilderness, heritage resources and grazing to the original idea of watershed protection and continuous timber. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 recognized outdoor recreation, wilderness preservation, and habitat for wildlife and fisheries.

The motto &quot;Land of Many Uses&quot; captures the National Forest goal of a healthy, vigorous forest that provides wood products, watershed protection, a variety of wildlife habitats and recreational opportunities, not only for today, but in a sustainable way so future generations can enjoy these benefits, too.

When the Allegheny National Forest was established in 1923, the immediate challenge was nurturing the young trees growing amongst logging slash on the recently cleared hillsides. Because of such heavy logging and mining, wildfires, floods and erosion were a threat. With care and a general absence of overt human interference and manipulation, the forests grew. Since they started growing at roughly the same time, most of the trees in today&#x27;s second-growth forest on the Allegheny Plateau are the same age (70–100 years old).

===1900 to Present===
Between 1900 and 1940, the young forest grew and evolved from openings to young forest to maturing forest.

Young forests offer diverse vegetation like seedlings, saplings, wildflowers and berries. Deer, grouse, songbirds and other wildlife thrive with the abundant food and cover. Rapidly growing trees soak up carbon, add much oxygen to the atmosphere, and protect soil. Taller trees shade streams, helping to regulate water temperature for aquatic life.

By the 1940s, the forest began to take on an appearance familiar to us today. The older trees provide acorns, cherries, and beech nuts for bear and turkey. Birds find sites for nests in the leafy tree crowns and plants like trillium prefer the filtered light of the maturing forest. In the 1940s, the Forest Service gradually resumed timber harvesting under strict research-based guidelines to ensure sustainability for future generations.

Abundant browse led to a dramatic increase in the deer population, which peaked in the 1940s and again in the late 1970s. Since the mid-1980s, the deer population has remained fairly constant, although at a level higher in many places than the forest can support.

Today the trees are mature and able to provide quality hardwood for furniture and other needs. Foresters deal with challenges like deer, insects, disease, drought and competing vegetation such as fern through research and careful management. A small percentage of the ANF, in select sections, will be left in its natural condition undisturbed by logging on a permanent basis, gradually progressing toward the biologically diverse old-growth condition.

This large region of Pennsylvania remains one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River.

==Forests and old growth==
The Forest lies within the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion and about 90% of its area is covered in forests. The Forest contains some of the most extensive tracts of remaining old-growth forest in Pennsylvania, totaling thousands of acres. These include northern hardwood forests in Hearts Content Scenic Area and Tionesta Scenic and Research Natural Areas as well as riverine forests on Crull&#x27;s and Thompson&#x27;s Islands.

==Forest research==
The Forest Service also established a research station for the Northeast in 1923. Soon, research scientists were studying complex relationships among vegetation, animals, soil, nutrients, weather and disease. For decades, scientists have shared both research results and management guidelines based on these results with the ANF, other public and private landowners, and other scientists.

==Recreation==
During the 1920s, recreation on the ANF focused mostly on dispersed activities like hunting and fishing. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps changed the face of National Forests across the country by building hundreds of recreation facilities, including Twin Lakes and Loleta Recreation Areas on the ANF. These and other facilities became popular after World War II when newly mobile families discovered the joys of outdoor recreation.

The creation of the Allegheny Reservoir when the Kinzua Dam was completed in 1965 brought the most dramatic change to developed recreation on the ANF. Within ten years, a tremendous development program resulted in campgrounds, boat launches, beaches, picnic areas, hiking trails and overlooks around the reservoir shoreline and elsewhere throughout the forest.

Over time, people&#x27;s changing and more sophisticated expectations led to campground improvements like electricity, hot showers, and baby-changing stations. Areas to watch wildlife (Buzzard Swamp, Little Drummer), trails for cross-country skiing and motorized recreation (all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles) and fully accessible fishing piers, trails and restrooms have been added, too. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed the Pennsylvania Wilderness Act into law, which designated the Hickory Creek Wilderness Area and Allegheny Islands Wilderness Area as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

==Multiple benefits, sustainability and the future==

Today, the Forest Service carries out a variety of management and research activities, providing multiple benefits with a strong scientific basis.

Defining the way a National Forest is to be managed can be controversial. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 required each National Forest to implement a Forest Plan with extensive public involvement, outlining a vision for how and where management activities will be emphasized. The ANF&#x27;s initial Forest Plan, which was approved in 1986, is currently undergoing revision. The revision process began in the fall of 2003, and was expected to be complete by early 2007. Additional parcels of the ANF are expected to be recommended to Congress for permanent protection as wilderness areas under the Wilderness Act of 1964 as a result of the Forest Plan revision process. (In a related connection, the Wilderness Act was authored in 1956 primarily by Howard Zahniser of The Wilderness Society, who grew up in the ANF town of Tionesta.)

==Conflict over oil and gas drilling rights==
Recently a conflict has arisen in the Allegheny National Forest over mineral rights. In 1923 the land that is now the Allegheny National Forest was purchased by the Federal Government, but the federal government did not buy the subsurface or mineral rights of the land because of financial issues. Private citizens currently own ninety-three percent of the subsurface land in the forest. Since the spike in oil prices around 2000, oil companies that own mineral rights have placed more drilling equipment in the forest. During an out of court settlement in April 2009, the United States Forest Service decided that the National Environmental Policy Act will govern all oil and gas drilling in the forest. The National Environmental Policy Act will make any oil or gas drilling in the forest subject to public judgement. On June 1, 2009, the Minard Run Oil Co., Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association, Allegheny Forest Alliance and Warren County Government filed suit in the United States District Court in Erie, Pennsylvania over the National Forest Service&#x27;s use of the National Environmental Policy Act.

<text>Beorhtwulf (, meaning &quot;bright wolf&quot;; also spelled &quot;Berhtwulf&quot;; died 852) was King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 839 or 840 to 852. His ancestry is unknown, though he may have been connected to Beornwulf, who ruled Mercia in the 820s. Almost no coins were issued by Beorhtwulf&#x27;s predecessor, Wiglaf, but a Mercian coinage was restarted by Beorhtwulf early in his reign, initially with strong similarities to the coins of Æthelwulf of Wessex, and later with independent designs. The Vikings attacked within a year or two of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s accession: the province of Lindsey was raided in 841, and London, a key centre of Mercian commerce, was attacked the following year. Another Viking assault on London in 851 &quot;put Beorhtwulf to flight&quot;, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;; the Vikings were subsequently defeated by Æthelwulf. This raid may have had a significant economic impact on Mercia, as London coinage is much reduced after 851.

Berkshire appears to have passed from Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign. The Welsh are recorded to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf&#x27;s successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf&#x27;s death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their overlord. Charters from Beorthwulf&#x27;s reign show a strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.

Beorhtwulf and his wife, Sæthryth, may have had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from witnessing his father&#x27;s charters, but he ceased to do so before the end of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign. Beorhtfrith appears in later sources which describe his murder of Wigstan, the grandson of Wiglaf, in a dispute over Beorhtfrith&#x27;s plan to marry Wigstan&#x27;s widowed mother Ælfflæd. Beorhtwulf&#x27;s death is not recorded in any surviving sources, but it is thought that he died in 852.

== Background and sources ==

For most of the 8th century, Mercia was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Mercian influence in the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, East Anglia, and Essex continued into the early 820s under Coenwulf of Mercia. However, Coenwulf&#x27;s death in 821 marked the beginning of a period in which Mercia suffered from dynastic conflicts and military defeats that redrew the political map of England. Four (possibly five) kings, from what appear to be four different kin-groups, ruled Mercia throughout the next six years. Little genealogical information about these kings has survived, but since Anglo-Saxon names often included initial elements common to most or all members of a family, historians have suggested that kin-groups in this period can be reconstructed on the basis of the similarity of their names. Three competing kin-groups are recognizable in the charters and regnal lists of the time: the &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Wig&quot; and &quot;B&quot; groups. The &quot;C&quot; group, which included the brothers Coenwulf, Cuthred of Kent, and Ceolwulf I, was dominant in the period following the deaths of Offa of Mercia and his son Ecgfrith in 796. Ceolwulf was deposed in 823 by Beornwulf, perhaps the first of the &quot;B&quot; group, who was killed fighting against the East Anglians in 826. He was followed by Ludeca, not obviously linked to any of the three groups, who was killed in battle the following year. After Ludeca&#x27;s death, the first of the &quot;Wig&quot; family came to power: Wiglaf, who died in 839 or 840. Beorhtwulf, who succeeded to the throne that year, is likely to have come from the &quot;B&quot; group, which may also have included the ill-fated Beornred who &quot;held [power] a little while and unhappily&quot; after the murder of King Æthelbald in 757.

An alternative model of Mercian succession is that a number of kin-groups may have competed for the succession. The sub-kingdoms of the Hwicce, the Tomsæte, and the unidentified Gaini are examples of such power-bases. Marriage alliances could also have played a part. Competing magnates—those called in charters &quot;dux&quot; or &quot;princeps&quot; (that is, leaders)—may have brought the kings to power. In this model, the Mercian kings are little more than leading noblemen.

An important source for the period is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex. Charters dating from Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign have survived; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a &quot;subregulus&quot;, or subking, of Æthelbald of Mercia.

== Accession and coinage ==
It is possible that Beorhtwulf is the same person as the Beorhtwulf who witnessed a charter of Wiglaf&#x27;s in 836. If so, this is Beorhtwulf&#x27;s first appearance in the historical record. His accession to the throne of Mercia is usually thought to have occurred in about 840. The date is not given directly in any of the primary sources, but it is known from regnal lists that he succeeded Wiglaf as king. Historian D. P. Kirby suggests that Wiglaf&#x27;s death occurred in 839, basing this date on the known chronology of the reigns of Beorhtwulf and Burgred, the next two Mercian kings. It is possible that Wigmund, the son of Wiglaf, was king briefly between Wiglaf and Beorhtwulf. The evidence for this possibility comes only from a later tradition concerning Wigmund&#x27;s son, Wigstan, so it is uncertain whether he actually did so.

Almost no Mercian coins are known from the 830s, after Wiglaf regained Mercia from Egbert of Wessex. Beorhtwulf restarted a Mercian coinage early in his reign, and the extended gap in the 830s has led to the suggestion that Wiglaf&#x27;s second reign was as a client king of Egbert&#x27;s, without permission to mint his own coinage. Beorhtwulf&#x27;s coinage would then indicate his independence of Mercia. However, it is more usually thought that Wiglaf took Mercia back by force. An alternative explanation for Beorhtwulf&#x27;s revival of the coinage is that it was part of a plan for economic regeneration in the face of the Viking attacks. The Viking threat may also account for the evident cooperation in matters of currency between Mercia and Wessex which began in Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign and lasted until the end of the independent Mercian kingdom on the death of King Ceolwulf II in the years around 880.

The earliest of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s coins were issued in 841–842, and can be identified as the work of a Rochester die-cutter who also produced coins early in the reign of Æthelwulf of Wessex. After ten years without any coinage, Beorhtwulf would have had to go outside Mercia to find skilled die-cutters, and Rochester was the closest mint. Hence the link to Rochester probably does not indicate that the coins were minted there; it is more likely that they were produced in London, which was under Mercian control. Subsequent coins of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s are very similar to Æthelwulf&#x27;s. One coin combines a portrait of Beorhtwulf on the reverse side with a design used by Æthelwulf on the obverse; this has been interpreted as indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms, but it is more likely to have been the work of a forger or an illiterate moneyer reusing the design of a coin of Æthelwulf&#x27;s. A different coinage appears later in the 840s, and was probably ended by the Viking attacks of 850–851. There are also coins without portraits that are likely to have been produced at the very end of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign.

== Reign ==

Beorhtwulf&#x27;s kingship began auspiciously. In the battle of Catill or Cyfeiliog, he killed King Merfyn Frych of Gwynedd and later sources imply (see below) that he was able to subjugate the northern Welsh after this.

However, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records Viking raids in 841 against the south and east coasts of Britain, including the Mercian province of Lindsey, centred on modern Lincoln. The city of London, chief centre of Mercia&#x27;s trade, was attacked the following year. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; states that there was &quot;great slaughter&quot; in London, and large coin hoards were buried in the city at this time.

Berkshire appears to have passed out of Mercian hands and become a part of the kingdom of Wessex at some point during the late 840s. In 844 Ceolred, the bishop of Leicester, granted Beorhtwulf an estate at Pangbourne, in Berkshire, so the area was still in Mercian hands at that date. Asser, writing in about 893, believed that King Alfred the Great was born between 847 and 849 at Wantage in Berkshire. The implication is that Berkshire had previously come under the control of Wessex, though it is also possible the territory was divided between the two kingdoms, possibly even before Beorhtwulf&#x27;s accession. Whatever the nature of the change, there is no record of how it occurred. It appears that the Mercian ealdorman Æthelwulf remained in office afterwards, implying a peaceful transition.

In 853, not long after Beorhtwulf&#x27;s death, the Welsh rebelled against Burgred and were subdued by an alliance between Burgred and Æthelwulf.

=== Charters ===
The synod at Croft held by Wiglaf in 836, which Beorhtwulf may have attended, was the last such conclave called together by a Mercian king. During Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign and thereafter, the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury. A charter of 840 provides evidence of a different kind concerning Beorhtwulf&#x27;s relations with the church. The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire. The lands had come under the control of the church in Worcester, but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again. In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church&#x27;s right to the land, but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return: &quot;four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds, and two silver horns of four pounds ... [and] ... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds.&quot; This is not an isolated case; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church, such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester, and promised in return that he would be &quot;more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community&quot; and, in the words of historian Patrick Wormald, &quot;would not rob them in future&quot;. Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find, as so much land had been granted to monasteries. The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede, who in a letter to Egbert, the Archbishop of York, had complained of &quot;a complete lack of places where the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate&quot;. Beorhtwulf&#x27;s concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement, and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure.

Holders of land were under an obligation to the king to support the king&#x27;s household, though exemptions could be obtained. A charter of the late 840s released the monastery of Breedon on the Hill from the requirement to supply food and lodging to Beorhtwulf&#x27;s servants and messengers, including &quot;the royal hawks, huntsmen, horses, and their attendants&quot;. The exemption cost a substantial sum, and did not release the monastery from every burden; the obligation to feed messengers from neighbouring kingdoms or from overseas was excluded from the exemption.

===End===
In 851, a Viking army landed at Thanet, then still an island, and over-wintered there. A second Viking force of 350 ships is reported by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; to have stormed Canterbury and London, and to have &quot;put to flight Beorhtwulf, king of Mercia, with his army&quot;. The Vikings were defeated by Æthelwulf and his sons, Æthelstan and Æthelbald, but the economic impact appears to have been significant, as Mercian coinage in London was very limited after 851.

No surviving contemporary source records Beorhtwulf&#x27;s death, but according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; his successor, Burgred, reigned for twenty-two years and was driven from his throne by the Vikings in 874, implying that Beorhtwulf died in 852. From Burgred&#x27;s charters it is known that his reign began before 25 July 852. It has been suggested that an otherwise unknown king named Eanred may have reigned briefly between Beorhtwulf and Burgred; the evidence for this consists of a single silver penny inscribed &quot;EANRED REX&quot;, which has similarities to some of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s and Æthelwulf&#x27;s pennies and hence is thought to have been produced after 850. The only recorded King Eanred ruled in Northumbria and is thought to have died in 840, though an alternative chronology of the Northumbrian kings has been proposed that would eliminate this discrepancy. Generally the penny is considered to belong to &quot;an unknown ruler of a southern kingdom&quot;, and it cannot be assumed that an Eanred succeeded Beorhtwulf.

== Family ==
Beorhtwulf was married to Sæthryth, apparently a figure of some importance in her own right as she witnessed all of his charters between 840 and 849, after which she disappears from the record. Beorhtwulf is said to have had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from witnessing his father&#x27;s charters, but he ceased to do so before the end of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s reign.

The story of Beorhtwulf&#x27;s other known son, Beorhtfrith, is told in the &quot;Passio sancti Wigstani&quot;, which may include material from a late 9th-century source, with some corroboration in the chronicle of John of Worcester. Beorhtfrith wished to marry the royal heiress Ælfflæd, King Ceolwulf&#x27;s daughter, widow of Wiglaf&#x27;s son Wigmund and mother of Wigstan. Wigstan refused to allow the marriage, since Beorhtfrith was a kinsman of Wigmund&#x27;s and was also Wigstan&#x27;s godfather. In revenge, Beorhtfrith murdered Wigstan, who was subsequently venerated as a saint. The story, though of late origin, is regarded as plausible by modern historians.

<doc id="692979" wikidata="Q880596" url="?curid=692979" title="Ceolwulf II of Mercia">
<text>Ceolwulf II (died c. 879) was the last king of independent Mercia. He succeeded Burgred of Mercia who was deposed by the Vikings in 874. His reign is generally dated 874 to 879 based on a Mercian regnal list which gives him a reign of five years. However, D. P. Kirby argues that he probably reigned into the early 880s. By 883, he was replaced by Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who became ruler of Mercia with the support of Alfred the Great, king of Wessex.

==Dynastic background==
On anthroponymic grounds, Ceolwulf is thought to belong to the &quot;C&quot; dynasty of Mercian kings, a family which claimed descent from Pybba of Mercia. The &quot;C&quot; dynasty, beginning with Coenwulf, may have had ties to the ruling family of Hwicce in south-west Mercia.

Ceolwulf&#x27;s immediate ancestry is unknown, but he is thought to be a descendant of Ceolwulf I through his daughter Ælfflæd. Ælfflæd was first married to Wigmund, son of King Wiglaf, and then to Beorhtfrith, son of King Beorhtwulf. Far from being &quot;an unwise king&#x27;s thane&quot;, it is clear that Ceolwulf was a descendant of previous kings. A number of thegns who witnessed charters under Burgred witnessed charters under Ceolwulf, and his charters were witnessed by Mercian bishops, testifying to his acceptance in Mercia.

==Mercia, Wessex and the Vikings==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; offers the following account of Ceolwulf:This year went the army [&quot;i.e.&quot;, the Great Heathen Army] from the Kingdom of Lindsey to Repton, and there took up their winter-quarters, drove the king [of Mercia], Burgred, over sea, when he had reigned about two and twenty winters, and subdued all that land. He then went to Rome, and there remained to the end of his life. And his body lies in the church of Sancta Maria, in the school of the English nation. And the same year they gave Ceolwulf, an unwise king&#x27;s thane, the Mercian kingdom to hold; and he swore oaths to them, and gave hostages, that it should be ready for them on whatever day they would have it; and he would be ready with himself, and with all those that would remain with him, at the service of the army.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was compiled on the orders of Alfred the Great, brother-in-law of King Burgred. This account is considered to be biased and politically motivated, written with a view of strengthening the claims of Alfred and Edward the Elder to the overlordship of Mercia, evidenced by a 2015 find of Anglo-Saxon Imperial coins dated to around 879, near Leominster, presumed to have been buried by retreating Vikings. The coins depict both Ceolwulf as a king as well as Alfred, leading some experts to indicate that the two were equals. According to Gareth Williams of the British Museum, &quot;these coins enable us to reinterpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom.&quot; 

Ceolwulf&#x27;s kingdom is presumed to have been reduced to the northern and western parts of Mercia.

==Wales==
In 878, King Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd was killed in battle against the English. As Alfred was then occupied fighting the Vikings, and Mercia traditionally claimed hegemony over Wales, the English leader was probably Ceolwulf. In 881 Rhodri&#x27;s sons defeated the Mercians at the Battle of the Conwy, a victory described in Welsh annals as &quot;revenge of God for Rhodri&quot;. The Mercian leader was Edryd Long-Hair, almost certainly Ceolwulf&#x27;s successor as Mercian ruler, Æthelred.
==Coinage and London==

Three types of penny have been found which were issued in Ceolwulf&#x27;s name. The bulk of them were minted at London and of the type designated as &quot;Cross-and-Lozenge&quot;, which was also in use by King Alfred of Wessex. Ceolwulf&#x27;s coinage appears to be closely related to that of Alfred of Wessex, and it has been suggested on this basis that the two kings co-operated against the Vikings.

Simon Keynes and the numismatist Mark Blackburn initially suggested that in about 875, Alfred was the sole recognised ruler in London, while Ceolwulf&#x27;s involvement would have come about only towards the end of his reign, 879. However, in 1998, the same year that their discussion was published, another &quot;Cross-and-Lozenge&quot; penny struck in Ceolwulf&#x27;s name came to light, which appears to be contemporary with Alfred&#x27;s earliest coinage.

In 2015, a metal-detectorist uncovered a hoard of Viking Age coins, jewellery and silver ingots near Watlington, Oxfordshire. The find, dating to the late 870s, included thirteen examples of the rare ‘Two Emperors’ penny which depict Alfred and Ceolwulf seated side by side.

<text>Annabella Gloria Sciorra ( , ; born March 29, 1960) is an American actress. She came to prominence with her film debut in &quot;True Love&quot; (1989) and worked steadily throughout the 1990s in films such as &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991), &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1991), &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992), &quot;The Addiction&quot; (1995), &quot;Cop Land&quot; (1997), and &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998). She received an Emmy Award nomination for her portrayal of Gloria Trillo on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2001–2004), appeared as Detective Carolyn Barek on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2005–2006), and had recurring roles on &quot;GLOW&quot; (2018), &quot;Truth Be Told&quot; (2019–2020), and &quot;Tulsa King&quot; (2022). Her stage credits include &quot;The Motherfucker with the Hat&quot; (Broadway, 2011).

Sciorra was regarded as one of the key figures of the #MeToo movement after speaking out against Harvey Weinstein and subsequently testifying at his sexual assault trial.

==Early life==
Sciorra was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City to Italian immigrant parents. Her mother was a fashion stylist from Formia, Lazio, and her father a veterinarian from Carunchio, Abruzzo. Sciorra studied dance as a child, and later took drama lessons at the Herbert Berghof Studio and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Career==

=== 1989–1990: Film debut and early roles ===

After making her professional debut in 1988 with a small part in the television miniseries &quot;The Fortunate Pilgrim&quot;, Sciorra landed her first major film role starring as Donna in &quot;True Love&quot; (1989), a romantic comedy-drama that won the Grand Jury Prize at that year&#x27;s Sundance Festival. Her performance was praised by critics, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting, &quot;Ms. Sciorra, with her gentle beauty and hard-as-nails negotiating style, perfectly captures the mood of the film, and makes Donna fully and touchingly drawn&quot;. The part earned Sciorra a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead the following year. Key roles in &quot;Internal Affairs&quot;, &quot;Cadillac Man&quot;, and the acclaimed drama &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; (all 1990) came next, with the latter receiving three Oscar nominations.

=== 1991–2000: Critical acclaim and box office successes ===

In 1991, after co-starring in buddy cop comedy &quot;The Hard Way&quot;, Sciorra garnered widespread attention with her portrayal of Angie Tucci in the acclaimed Spike Lee drama &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;, which was shortlisted for the Palme d&#x27;Or at that year&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote that Sciorra was &quot;possessed of considerable presence, assurance and vulnerability&quot;. Meanwhile, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented:

The following year, Sciorra headlined Curtis Hanson&#x27;s hit psychological thriller &quot;The Hand That Rocks The Cradle&quot; (1992), which held the top position at the U.S. box office for four weeks. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that, with her portrayal of Claire Bartel, Sciorrra &quot;brings her eye-of-the-storm serenity to the role of a passionately ordinary middle-class woman&quot;, giving an &quot;accomplished performance&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; said in their review, &quot;A totally deglamorized Sciorra becomes unglued subtly and slowly, eliciting sympathy without begging for it&quot;. In subsequent years, the film has been highlighted as one of the quintessential examples of 1990s genre filmmaking.

Sciorra continued to work steadily throughout the decade. Film parts included romantic leads in &quot;The Night We Never Met&quot;, neo-noir crime thriller &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;, and romantic comedy &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; (all 1993); &quot;The Addiction&quot; (1995), her first of several projects with cult filmmaker Abel Ferrara; James Mangold&#x27;s critically acclaimed, financially successful &quot;Cop Land&quot; (1997); and the fantasy drama &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998). Film critic Roger Ebert described her portrayal of Annie Nielsen in the latter as &quot;heartbreakingly effective&quot;.

=== 2001–present: &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and subsequent television work ===

In 2001, Sciorra was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress for her &quot;electric&quot; portrayal of Gloria Trillo on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, a part described as &quot;career changing&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which she played intermittently until 2004. Next, she co-starred in the Sidney Lumet-directed &quot;Find Me Guilty&quot; (2006). Based on the true story of the longest Mafia trial in American history, the film was described as &quot;gripping&quot; by Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who also called Sciorra&#x27;s performance &quot;excellent&quot;.

Subsequent credits included main roles in the CBS courtroom drama series &quot;Queens Supreme&quot; (2003) and the Fox medical drama &quot;Mental&quot; (2009), guest parts on shows such as &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; (both 2007), &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012), &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (both 2013), and recurring roles on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;—as Detective Carolyn Barek (2005–2006)—and &quot;GLOW&quot;, where she played Rosalie Biagi (2018).

In 2018, Sciorra portrayed Rosalie Carbone on the second season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Luke Cage&quot;. Executive producer Cheo Hodari Coker said of her casting, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of [Sciorra] since &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;, and [she&#x27;s] no joke as Rosalie Carbone. You haven&#x27;t seen her this gangster since ... &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. I&#x27;m thrilled her introduction to the Marvel Universe will be [this show]&quot;. Later that year, she reprised the part of Carbone for two episodes of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

Between 2019 and 2020, Sciorra played Erin Buhrman in seven episodes of the Apple TV+ legal drama &quot;Truth Be Told&quot;. She has since appeared in recurring roles on NBC&#x27;s &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; (2021), the MGM+ crime series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot; (2021), CBS drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; (2021–2022), and the Paramount+ series &quot;Tulsa King&quot; (2022).

==Personal life==
Sciorra was married to actor Joe Petruzzi from 1989 to 1993. In 2004, she began a relationship with Bobby Cannavale which lasted for three years; the relationship ended in 2007.

In October 2017, Sciorra leveled allegations of rape against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. In an article published by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Sciorra alleged that Weinstein raped her after he forced his way into her apartment in 1993, then over a number of years repeatedly harassed her. Sciorra was the key witness addressing the predatory sexual assault charges during Weinstein&#x27;s trial in 2020, leading to his conviction.

<text>Chinese folklore encompasses the folklore of China, and includes songs, poetry, dances, puppetry, and tales. It often tells stories of human nature, historical or legendary events, love, and the supernatural. The stories often explain natural phenomena and distinctive landmarks. Along with Chinese mythology, it forms an important element in Chinese folk religion.

==History==
==Folktales==
The main influences on Chinese folk tales have been Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Some folktales may have arrived from Germany when Grimm brothers had contributed some materials for the folktales regard to the country life of the German dwellers since the 1840s; others have no known western counterparts, but are widespread throughout East Asia. Chinese folktales include a vast variety of forms such as myths, legends, fables, etc. A number of collections of such tales, such as Pu Songling&#x27;s &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;, now remain popular.

Each Chinese folktale includes the representation of various objects and animals and uses symbolic messages through its characters and usually strives to convey a message that instills the reader with some sort of virtuous insight. These messages are vital to Chinese culture and through these folktales, they will be passed down to future generations to also learn from.

=== Animals ===
The Great Race is a folk story that describes the creation of the Chinese zodiac calendar that includes twelves animals each representing a specific year in a twelve-year cycle.

Chinese folklore contains many symbolic folk meanings for the objects and animals within the folktales. One example of this is the symbolic meaning behind frogs and toads. Toads are named Ch&#x27;an Chu () in Chinese, a folklore about Ch&#x27;an Chu illustrates the toad imports the implication of eternal life and perpetual. Chinese folklore unfolds the story of a Ch&#x27;an Chu (toad) is saved by Liu Hai, who is a courtier in ancient Chinese period. For recompense the gratitude to Liu Hai, Ch&#x27; an Chu divulge the secret of eternal life and being immortal to Liu Hai. And this is the origin of Ch&#x27; an Chu as a symbol of eternal in traditional Chinese folklore culture.

In the &quot;Chinese myth of the Moon Goddess, Chang&#x27;e&quot;, frogs and toads are a symbol of wealth and prosperity as well as symbolize fertility, regeneration, yin, and immortality. It is said that there were ten suns exposing the earth in the ancient times. Hou Yi who was an archer as well as the husband of Chang&#x27;e, he shot down nine suns from the sky with his bow and arrow. For expressing gratitude god rewarded him with pill which is an immortal elixir. In some versions of this tale, Chang&#x27;e took the pill for in avarice and she transformed into a three-legged Ch&#x27;an Chu and eventually flew to the moon. Hou Yi loved his wife so much that God allowed him to reunite annually with Chang&#x27;e at moment of the full moon on the 15th of August in Chinese lunar calendar, which is the celebration of Mid-Autumn Festival. From then on, the moon and Chang&#x27;e relate to the toad comprise the significance eternal and reunion.

==Study==
Formal academic study of Chinese folklore began to gain popularity in the 1910s with the New Culture Movement, which advocated Vernacular Chinese as the language of education and literature. Because most folklore was created in the spoken language, this movement brought scholars&#x27; attention to the influences of folklore on classical literature. Hu Shi of Peking University, a strong advocate of Vernacular Chinese, concluded that when Chinese writers drew their inspiration from traditional tales and songs, Chinese literature experienced a renaissance. When writers neglected these sources, they lost touch with the people of the nation. An emphasis on the study of folklore, Hu concluded, could usher in a literary renaissance. A rising sense of national identity also spurred the new interest in traditional folklore. The first issue of the &quot;Folk-Song Weekly&quot;, a publication issued by the Folk-Song Research Society, stated that &quot;Based on the folk songs, on the real feeling of the nation, a kind of new national poetry may be produced.&quot;

The Folksong Studies Movement became a key contributor to establishing Chinese folklore as a modern academic discipline. This movement was founded by Hu Shi&#x27;s students and colleagues at Peking University, such as Gu Jiegang. They were successful in creating a field of study that focused on literature pertaining to Chinese folklore and attempted to bring to light the early traditions and culture of Chinese folklore in order to reestablish China&#x27;s national spirit.; The May Fourth Movement in 1919 sparked patriotic students and scholars to collect and record historical folklore in both rural and urban areas. Folklore collections in the May Fourth Movement had a broad territorial sweep, including not only the ethnic Han, who form the majority, but also the minority areas. Folksong collection was carried by Peking University one year before the May Fourth Movement, started in 1918. 

Some folklore enthusiasts also hoped to improve the condition of the Chinese people and believed it necessary to understand their ideas, beliefs, and customs. Communist activists and scholars collected songs and local lore, often, reinventing and reinterpreting them to emphasize such themes as the virtue of the working commoner and the evil of aristocracy, while they left out stories that expressed praise for the emperor or traditional Confucian values from their collections. Widely circulated stories of today may have been treated in this way. Some claimed that folksongs played a significant part in the integration of folklore culture in the early twentieth century of China, as well as a functional tool to convey the spirit of socialism and communism after the Liberation period. After China emerged from the Maoist period in the late 1970s, the state adopted a more accepting position toward academic research on China&#x27;s cultural traditions and folklore. Forbidden traditions and practices in early Chinese history became more relevant and accepted.

==Poetry and Songs==
The &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, the earliest known Chinese collection of poetry, contains 160 folk songs in addition to courtly songs and hymns. One tradition holds that Confucius himself collected these songs, while another says that an emperor compiled them as a means to gauge the mood of the people and the effectiveness of his rule.

It is believed that Confucius did encourage his followers to study the songs contained in the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, helping to secure the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;&#x27;s place among the &quot;Five Classics&quot;. After Confucian ideas became further entrenched in Chinese culture (after about 100 BCE), Confucius&#x27;s endorsement led many scholars to study the lyrics of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; and interpret them as political allegories and commentaries.

Folksongs are divided into three major parts which are shan&#x27; ge (mountain songs), xiaodiao (little tunes), and chang&#x27;ge (long songs). Regarding shan&#x27;ge the mountain songs are having a deviation to represent the specific regional level, concentrating on rural rather than urban region. Xiaodiao can be considered as the mainstream folksongs among the genres, which are introduced to the general public with familiarity. Always accompanied by performs and professional stage shows presenting to the public. In terms of the chang&#x27;ge, long songs, which is a certain kind of narrative songs utilized mostly by the national minorities in some special events as a narrative form in singing.

==Influence of folklore on other media==
=== Art ===
Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for visual imagery by Chinese weavers, painters, water colorists, and florists. One of the most striking examples is a silk funerary banner (circa 168 BC) that contains a number of stories from early China.

=== Film ===
Modern iterations of traditional Chinese stories can be found internationally as well as in native Chinese literature. Laurence Yep&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Paintbrush&quot;, Maxine Hong Kingston&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;, and Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;Mulan&quot; (based on Hua Mulan) all borrow from Chinese folklore traditions.

=== Literature ===
Chinese folklore has provided inspiration for Chinese writers and poets for centuries. Folk songs, which were originally accompanied by dance and other styles of performing arts, provided inspiration for courtly poetry. Classical fiction began in the Han dynasty and was modeled after oral traditions, while Yuan and Ming era dramatic plays were influenced by folk plays.

<doc id="692993" wikidata="Q173014" url="?curid=692993" title="Peter Sauber">
<text>Peter Paul Sauber (born 13 October 1943) is a retired Swiss motorsport executive. He was the team principal and owner of various motorsports teams, most visibly the eponymous Sauber Formula One team.

==Motorsport career==
After being trained as an electrician, Sauber became a car salesman in Hinwil, Switzerland. This was Sauber&#x27;s first real association with automobiles and it proved to be the catalyst for his involvement in motorsports. He competed in hillclimbing events in a Volkswagen Beetle he had purchased, and thus the foundations for his first project as a team owner were laid.

===Team Sauber===
After opting not to run the family traffic light business, Peter built the Sauber C1 (the C stands for Christiane, the name of his wife) in his parents&#x27; basement. It was a car of tubular frame, powered by a 1-litre Ford Cosworth engine. He subsequently drove it to the 1970 Swiss hillclimb championship. It also remained in racing for ten years in the hands of other drivers, notably Friedrich Hürzeler, who took the 1974 crown in the car.

In 1971, Sauber handed over the driver&#x27;s seat to Hans Kunis, who drove the new Sauber C2 model in the same series, as Sauber himself had done so the year before. Sauber had started to gain a portfolio of customers and in 1973, Sauber built three C3 spec chassis for different customers. Designed by Guy Boisson, the car was used predominantly in the Swiss Sports Car Championship.

The C4 of 1975 heralded the first aluminium chassis developed by the team, and Boisson was joined by Edy Wiss in designing it. Only one C4 was ever produced.

The most successful of the early Sauber cars, the C5 was used to great effect in conjunction with its 2-litre BMW engine—taking the 1976 Interserie Championship in the hands of Herbert Muller. Being a Group 6 sports car, the car was allowed to take part in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Sauber entered the C5 in both 1977 and 1978. In &#x27;77 the car led its class before retiring; the same thing happened in &#x27;78.
The year 1979 marked the end of Sauber&#x27;s first foray into sports car building – and the start of preparing chassis for Lola F2 cars. The drivers finished 1–2–4 in the championship that year – one of them was Max Welti, who subsequently joined the team as team manager.

In 1980, and 1981, Sauber and Welti turned their attention to developing BMW M1 sportscars, in the latter year it won the 1000km Nürburgring.

In 1982, with BASF sponsorship, Sauber returned to sports car racing. The C6 was the first car to be tested in a wind tunnel by Sauber. It was during these tests that Sauber built up a strong relationship with Leo Ress, who would later become instrumental in the F1 project.

In 1985, the team&#x27;s relationship with Mercedes-Benz began. This sports car partnership culminated in November 1991 – having ignited the career of Michael Schumacher and Sauber&#x27;s own protégé, Karl Wendlinger.

===Formula One===
Sauber now began to look seriously at launching an F1 team. In the summer of 1991 Harvey Postlethwaite joined the team to design an F1 car and Mercedes funded a vast new factory at Hinwil.

====First Sauber team (1991–2005)====

In November 1991 Mercedes decided against direct involvement and so Sauber entered F1 by itself in 1993, with drivers JJ Lehto and Karl Wendlinger powered by engines built by Ilmor but rebadged as Saubers. Sauber did convince Mercedes to enter F1 in 1994 but a year later the German company did a deal with McLaren, leaving Sauber to become the Ford F1 works team. This was followed by a deal with the Malaysian oil company Petronas in 1995 and the establishment of an engineering company called Sauber Petronas Engineering to design and build V10 engines. The company began buying old Ferrari engines and rebadging them as Sauber Petronas V10s but the F1 engine program itself was scrapped in 1998. In the later years of this period Sauber saw increased success with the team finishing fourth in the World Championship in 2001 and fifth in 2002 despite having a much smaller budget than many of its rivals. The team however never scored a race win.

====The sale to BMW (2005–2009)====

In June 2005, BMW acquired the major shareholding stake in the Sauber team from Credit Suisse, which owned more than 60% of the team from a deal Peter Sauber initiated in 1994 selling a majority stake of the team to its major sponsor. It was done with Peter Sauber&#x27;s blessing, the team was known as BMW Sauber, and Peter took a background advisory role within it, retaining a 20% stake in the team.

====Return to Peter Sauber (2009–2016)====

In July 2009, BMW announced its withdrawal from Formula One at the end of the season. Peter Sauber worked with BMW to develop a rescue package that would allow the team to continue in the sport without the manufacturer&#x27;s backing. Qadbak Investments Ltd were thought to have purchased the team, but on 27 November 2009 it was announced that the Qadbak deal had fallen through and BMW had instead reached an agreement to sell the entire F1 operation back to Peter Sauber.

This sale would only go ahead if the team was granted a place on the 2010 grid by the FIA. On 3 December 2009, the FIA announced it had confirmed Sauber&#x27;s entry for the 2010 season had been granted, and Sauber regained ownership of the team. In May 2012, Sauber transferred a one-third stake in the Sauber Group to Monisha Kaltenborn, the team&#x27;s CEO and his designated successor. In October, it was announced that Sauber was stepping back from the day-to-day running of his team, promoting Kaltenborn to the team principal&#x27;s position. He remains President of the Sauber Group&#x27;s board of directors.

The 2016 Formula One season saw Sauber back on the grid with financial troubles. In July 2016 Longbow Finance, a Swiss investment company, bought Sauber Motorsport gaining complete ownership. With the sale, Peter Sauber announced his retirement from motorsport with Pascal Picci taking his position at the company.

==Personal life==
Sauber is married to Christiane (for whom all of his cars are designated &quot;C&quot;). They have two sons: Philipp (born 1971) and Alex (born 1973). Alex began working for the Sauber team in 2010.

<doc id="692996" wikidata="Q1067993" url="?curid=692996" title="Ælfwynn">
<text>Ælfwynn was the ruler of Mercia as the &#x27;Second Lady of the Mercians&#x27; for a few months in 918, following her mother&#x27;s death on 12 June 918. She was the daughter of Æthelred and Æthelflæd, the rulers of Mercia. Her accession was the only example of rule passing from one woman to another in the early medieval period in the British Isles. Manuscript C of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (ASC C) states: &quot;Here also the daughter of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, was deprived of all control in Mercia, and was led into Wessex three weeks before Christmas; she was called Ælfwynn.&quot; ASC C dates Æthelflæd&#x27;s death as 12 June 918 and Ælfwynn&#x27;s deposition to December 919, but most historians revise the deposition to 918. George Molyneux gives the period of Ælfwynn&#x27;s power as &quot;six or eighteen months&quot;. ASC C is the only version of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; to mention Ælfwynn. Other versions reflect a West Saxon view point and ASC A states that Edward took power in Mercia immediately after Æthelflæd&#x27;s death, but ASC C includes entries from a lost version called the &#x27;Mercian Chronicle&#x27;.

==Life==
Ælfwynn&#x27;s parents may have married as early as 882 and not later than 887. According to William of Malmesbury, Ælfwynn was the only child of Æthelflæd and Æthelred. The date of her birth is not recorded, but it is presumed that she was born soon after her parents&#x27; marriage, perhaps around 888. William&#x27;s account states that her birth was a difficult one, and that this led her mother to abstain from further sexual relations.

Ælfwynn&#x27;s father spent much of the decade after her birth on campaign with his father-in-law King Alfred and brother-in-law Edward Ætheling (later King Edward the Elder). By 902 his health was poor and Æthelflæd was from then onwards the effective ruler of Mercia. William of Malmesbury states that Alfred sent his eldest grandson, Æthelstan son of Edward, to be educated at the court of Æthelflæd. William&#x27;s panegyric on Æthelstan claims that he received a first-class education in Mercia, and it is thought likely that Ælfwynn would have been equally well educated.

The first contemporary written evidence of Ælfwynn is dated to around 904, a charter (S 1280) recording the lease of land by Æthelred and Æthelflæd for the traditional three lives—those of Æthelred, Æthelflæd and Ælfwynn—in and around Worcester from Bishop Waerferth and the monks and clerics of Worcester Cathedral. Ælfwynn did not witness this charter, but she may have witnessed charter S 225 of circa 915, concerning lands around Farnborough, and she is very probably the Ælfwynn who witnessed S 367 of circa 903 relating to lands in Buckinghamshire.

===Reign===
Ælfwynn&#x27;s mother died on 12 June 918. Unlike her mother, Ælfwynn may have lacked broad support. No opposition to Edward&#x27;s decision to remove her from power and send her to Wessex in December 918 is recorded by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; or elsewhere. It could be considered that Ælfwynn was the last ruler of Mercia, but that kingdom was not entirely absorbed into the kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, later the kingdom of England, until much later. Her cousin Æthelstan was ruler of Mercia only before becoming king of the Anglo-Saxons, and so too was King Edgar ruler of the Mercians under his elder brother King Eadwig.

===Later life===
There is no certain record of Ælfwynn after her removal from power. In Maggie Bailey&#x27;s view, she probably entered holy orders. It is possible that she is the religious woman named Ælfwynn who is the beneficiary of charter S 535 dated 948 in the reign of King Eadred. Shashi Jayakumar suggests that she may have been the Ælfwynn who was wife of Æthelstan Half-King and foster-mother of the future King Edgar.

Caradoc&#x27;s &quot;History of Wales&quot; preserves a tradition that Ælfwynn was deposed on a pretense of secretly planning to marry a Danish king, but this is described by Michael Livingston as &quot;historically unlikely&quot;.

<doc id="692997" wikidata="Q427956" url="?curid=692997" title="Tannic acid">
<text>Tannic acid is a specific form of tannin, a type of polyphenol. Its weak acidity (pKa around 6) is due to the numerous phenol groups in the structure. The chemical formula for commercial tannic acid is often given as C76H52O46, which corresponds with decagalloyl glucose, but in fact it is a mixture of polygalloyl glucoses or polygalloyl quinic acid esters with the number of galloyl moieties per molecule ranging from 2 up to 12 depending on the plant source used to extract the tannic acid. Commercial tannic acid is usually extracted from any of the following plant parts: Tara pods (&quot;Caesalpinia spinosa&quot;), gallnuts from &quot;Rhus semialata&quot; or &quot;Quercus infectoria&quot; or Sicilian sumac leaves (&quot;Rhus coriaria&quot;).

According to the definitions provided in external references such as international pharmacopoeia, Food Chemicals Codex and FAO-WHO tannic acid monograph only tannins obtained from the above-mentioned plants can be considered as tannic acid. Sometimes extracts from chestnut or oak wood are also described as tannic acid but this is an incorrect use of the term. It is a yellow to light brown amorphous powder.

While tannic acid is a specific type of tannin (plant polyphenol), the two terms are sometimes (incorrectly) used interchangeably. The long-standing misuse of the terms, and its inclusion in scholarly articles has compounded the confusion. This is particularly widespread in relation to green tea and black tea, both of which contain many different types of tannins not just exclusively tannic acid.

Tannic acid is not an appropriate standard for any type of tannin analysis because of its poorly defined composition.

== Quercitannic and gallotannic acids ==

Quercitannic acid is one of the two forms of tannic acid found in oak bark and leaves. The other form is called gallotannic acid and is found in oak galls.

The quercitannic acid molecule is also present in quercitron, a yellow dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern black oak (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;), a forest tree indigenous in North America. It is described as a yellowish-brown amorphous powder.

In 1838, Jöns Jacob Berzelius wrote that quercitannate is used to dissolve morphine.

In 1865 in the fifth volume of &quot;A dictionary of chemistry&quot;, Henry Watts wrote : 
It exhibits with ferric salts the same reactions as gallotannic acid. It differs however from the latter in not being convertible into gallic acid, and not yielding pyrogallic acid by dry distillation. It is precipitated by sulfuric acid in red flocks. (Stenhouse, Ann. Ch. Pharm. xlv. 16.)
&lt;br&gt;According to Rochleder (ibid lxiii. 202), the tannic acid of black tea is the same as that of oak-bark.

In 1880, Etti gave for it the molecular formula C17H16O9. He described it as an unstable substance, having a tendency to give off water to form anhydrides (called phlobaphenes), one of which is called &quot;oak-red&quot; (C34H30O17). For him, it was not a glycoside.

In Allen&#x27;s &quot;Commercial Organic Analysis&quot;, published in 1912, the formula given was C19H16O10.

Other authors gave other molecular formulas like C28H26O15, while another formula found is C28H24O11.

According to Lowe, two forms of the principle exist – &quot;one soluble in water, of the formula C28H28O14, and the other scarcely soluble, C28H24O12. Both are changed by the loss of water into oak red, C28H22O11.&quot;

Quercitannic acid was for a time a standard used to assess the phenolic content in spices, given as &quot;quercitannic acid equivalent&quot;.

In an interesting historical note, the inventor of carborundum, Edward G. Acheson, discovered that gallotannic acid greatly improved the plasticity of clay. In his report of this discovery in 1904 he noted that the only known historical reference to the use of organic material added to clay is the use of straw mixed with clay described in the Bible, Exodus 1:11 and that the Egyptians must have been aware of his (re-)discovery. He stated &quot;This explains why the straw was used and why the children of Israel were successful in substituting stubble for straw, a course that would hardly be possible, were the fibre of the straw depended upon as a bond feasible for the clay, but quite reasonable where the extract of the plant was used.&quot;

==Uses==

Tannins are a basic ingredient in the chemical staining of wood, and are already present in woods like oak, walnut, and mahogany. Tannic acid can be applied to woods low in tannin so chemical stains that require tannin content will react. The presence of tannins in the bark of redwood (&quot;Sequoia)&quot; is a strong natural defense against wildfire, decomposition and infestation by certain insects such as termites. It is found in the seeds, bark, cones, and heartwood.

Tannic acid is a common mordant used in the dyeing process for cellulose fibers such as cotton, often combined with alum and/or iron. The tannin mordant should be done first as metal mordants combine well with the fiber-tannin complex. However this use has lost considerable interest.

Similarly tannic acid can also be used as an aftertreatment to improve wash fastness properties of acid dyed polyamide. It is also an alternative for fluorocarbon aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to polyamide yarn or carpets.
However, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of upholstery flock; this serves as an anti-static treatment.

Tannic acid is used in the conservation of ferrous (iron based) metal objects to passivate and inhibit corrosion. Tannic acid reacts with the corrosion products to form a more stable compound, thus preventing further corrosion from taking place. After treatment the tannic acid residue is generally left on the object so that if moisture reaches the surface the tannic acid will be rehydrated and prevent or slow any corrosion. Tannic acid treatment for conservation is very effective and widely used but it does have a significant visual effect on the object, turning the corrosion products black and any exposed metal dark blue. It should also be used with care on objects with copper alloy components as the tannic acid can have a slight etching effect on these metals.

Tannic acid is also found in commercially available iron/steel corrosion treatments, such as Hammerite Kurust.

===Use in food===
In many parts of the world, its uses in food are permitted. In the United States, tannic acid is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration for use in baked goods and baking mixes, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy products, soft and hard candy, meat products, and rendered animal fat.

According to EU directive 89/107/EEC, tannic acid cannot be considered as a food additive and consequently does not hold an E number. Under directive 89/107/EEC, tannic acid can be referred to as a food ingredient. The E-number E181 is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to tannic acid; this in fact refers to the INS number assigned to tannic acid under the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius system.

===Uses as a medication===

In conjunction with magnesium and sometimes activated charcoal, tannic acid was once used as a treatment for many toxic substances, such as strychnine, mushroom, and ptomaine poisonings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The introduction of tannic acid treatment of severe burn injuries in the 1920s significantly reduced mortality rates. During World War I, tannic acid dressings were prescribed to treat &quot;burns, whether caused by incendiary bombs, mustard gas, or lewisite&quot;. After the war this use was abandoned due to the development of more modern treatment regimens.

== Hazards ==
Tannic acid could cause potential health hazards such as damage to the eye, skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. It may cause irritation, redness, pain, blurred vision, and possible eye damage. When tannic acid is absorbed through the skin in harmful amounts, it may cause irritation, redness, and pain. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are symptoms of tannic acid ingestion and prolonged exposure may cause liver damage. Upon inhalation, tannic acid may cause respiratory tract irritation.

==Crocodilian coloration==

Skin color in Crocodilia (crocodiles and alligators) is very dependent on water quality. Algae-laden waters produce greener skin, while tannic acid in the water from decay of leaves from overhanging trees (which produces some types of blackwater rivers) often produce darker skin in these animals.

<text>Malaysian Chinese, Chinese Malaysians, or Sino-Malaysians are Malaysian citizens of Han Chinese ethnicity. They form the second-largest ethnic group in Malaysia, after the Malay majority, and , constituted 21.2% of Malaysia&#x27;s total population. In addition, Malaysian Chinese make up the third-largest community of overseas Chinese globally, after Indonesian and Thai Chinese.

Within Malaysia, the ethnic Chinese community maintains a significant and substantial presence in the country&#x27;s economy.

Most Malaysian Chinese are descendants of Southern Chinese immigrants who arrived in Malaysia between the early 19th and the mid-20th centuries before the country attained independence from British colonial rule. The majority originate from the provinces of Fujian and Lingnan (including the three modern provinces of Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi). They belong to diverse ethnic Han subgroups such as the Hokkien and Fuzhou from Fujian, the Teochew, Cantonese, and Hakka from Guangdong, the Hainanese from Hainan and Kwongsai from Guangxi. Most Malaysian Chinese have maintained their Han Chinese heritage, identity, culture and language.

Another group of Chinese migrants who arrived between the 13th and the 17th centuries heavily assimilated aspects of the indigenous Malay cultures and formed a distinct group known as the Peranakan in Kelantan and Terengganu, the Baba-Nyonya in Malacca and Penang, and as the Sino-Natives in Sabah. They exhibit a degree of intermarriage with native groups and are culturally distinct from the majority of the Malaysian Chinese but have recently begun to merge into the Malaysian Chinese mainstream.

The Malaysian Chinese are referred to as simply &quot;Chinese&quot; in Malaysian English, &quot;&quot;Orang Cina&quot; in Malay, &quot;Sina&quot; or &quot;Kina&quot; among indigenous groups in Borneo, &quot;Cīṉar&quot;&quot; (சீனர்) in Tamil, &quot;&quot;Huaren&quot;&quot; (華人/华人, Chinese people) or &quot;&quot;Huayi&quot; (華裔/华裔, ethnic Chinese) in Mandarin, &quot;təŋ laŋ&quot;&quot; (唐人) in Hokkien and &quot;Wàhyàhn&quot; (華人/华人, Chinese people) in Cantonese.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

China and other early kingdoms in the Malay Archipelago, such as the northern area of the Malay Peninsula and Po-Ni in western Borneo, have long been connected. The first recorded movement of people from China into present-day Malaysia was the 1292 arrival of Mongol expeditionary forces under Kublai Khan in Borneo in 1292 in preparation for their invasion of Java the following year. Many of Khan&#x27;s Chinese followers settled on the island with Chinese traders after the campaign, establishing an enclave along the Kinabatangan River. Their arrival was welcomed by the indigenous people, who benefited from the jars, beads, silk, and pottery brought to the island by the Chinese.
Chinese explorer and sailor Zheng He commanded several expeditions to south-east Asia between 1405 and 1430; during his third voyage, Zheng also visited Malacca. His companion and translator, Ma Huan, described Malacca in his &quot;Yingya Shenglan.&quot; Formerly part of Thailand, Malacca was founded after convoys from the Ming Dynasty developed a city and the area&#x27;s chief was crowned king. During his fourth imperial-fleet visit, Ma wrote that the local king had just converted to Islam and dressed like an Arab. The last edition of &quot;Mingshi&quot;, one of the official Chinese &quot;Twenty-Four Histories,&quot; mentioned a pre-established Chinese settlement in the area. Mentions in other records exist, especially after trade contacts were established with the Nanyang region. According to &quot;Hai Yü&quot; (&quot;Words about the Sea)&quot;, written by Huang Zhong and published in 1537, the lifestyle of the Chinese community in Malacca differed from that of the local Malays.

This close relationship was maintained during the Islamisation of the Malacca and Brunei kingdoms, whose thalassocracy once covered much of present-day Malaysia. Both the Muslim sultanates pledged protection to the Chinese dynasties from further conquest by the neighbouring Javanese Majapahit or the Siamese Ayutthaya. This relationship resulted in interethnic marriage between the sultanate&#x27;s royal family and the Chinese envoy and representatives. Zheng He&#x27;s arrival encouraged the spread of Islam in the Malay Archipelago and aided the growth of the Chinese Muslim population from the Eastern Chinese coastal towns of Fujian and Canton, with many of their traders arriving in the coastal towns of present-day Malaysia and Indonesia by the early 15th century. In addition to the early settlements in Kinabatangan and Malacca, two more old Chinese settlements are located in Terengganu and the Penang Island as part of trade networks with their respective areas.

=== Colonial era (1500–1900) ===

Although many Chinese traders avoided Portuguese Malacca after its 1511 conquest, the flow of emigrants from China continued. The Zhengde Emperor retaliated against the Portuguese for their activities in Malacca during the Ming dynasty after the arrival of their fleet in Canton. The Chinese emperor was reluctant to help the deposed Malaccan ruler reclaim his position, however, since the dynasty foreign policy was changing to maintain friendly relations with the Portuguese.

His successor, the Jiajing Emperor, changed the attitude of the Ming court by executing two government officials and reaffirming the importance of Malaccan issues in major policy decisions. Some Chinese, including those from Fujian (defying Ming-Dynasty regulation for the sake of trade), informed the Portuguese of the trade route between Guangdong and Siam. Since the local Malaccan Chinese were not treated favourably by the Portuguese, they and most overseas Chinese refused to cooperate with them. Through the Portuguese administration in Malacca, Chinese Muslims sided with other Islamic traders against the latter by providing ships and human capital. Negotiations were later held in Guangdong between Chinese officials and Portuguese envoys about Malaccan issues, with Malacca remaining under Portuguese control.
After the 1641 Dutch takeover of Malacca, many local Malaccan Chinese were hired to construct Dutch buildings. The Dutch found the Chinese industrious, and encouraged their participation in the colony&#x27;s economic life; the Dutch also established a settlement in Perak in 1650 through an earlier treaty with Aceh and suggested that Alauddin, the 17th Sultan of Perak, allow the Chinese to develop tin mines. This facilitated Alauddin&#x27;s plan to request more Chinese workers from Malacca, and the sultan promised to punish any official guilty of mistreating the Chinese.

With the sultan consent, the Chinese played a leading role in the tin-mining industry. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1780 adversely affected the tin trade, however, and many Chinese miners left. Early Chinese settlements in Malacca and several areas along the archipelago&#x27;s coasts notwithstanding, most mass Chinese migration to Malaysia occurred after the founding of British settlements in Malaya and Borneo during the early 19th century.
A 1786 British settlement in Penang and another in Singapore in 1819 triggered a mass emigration from China to the Malay Peninsula. After the establishment of British rule in Labuan in 1846, more ethnic Chinese (primarily Hakka, and many from Singapore) arrived in British Borneo. The migration continued through the first few years of the North Borneo Chartered Company.
Chinese migration to Labuan and North Borneo was largely confined to the agricultural sector; migration to the Raj of Sarawak was largely restricted to the mining and agricultural sectors. Rajah Charles Brooke of Sarawak promoted the migration of Chinese and Dayak people to interior Sarawak to develop the region. This resulted in the establishment of an administrative center and bazaar by the 19th century, primarily in Sarawak&#x27;s First, Second, and Third Divisions.

Rajah Charles invited Chinese black-pepper growers from Singapore to settle in Kuching in 1876, and they were later joined by local Chinese miners and others from neighbouring Dutch Borneo. With the introduction of pepper to the kingdom, pepper cultivation in Sarawak&#x27;s First Division Kuching-Serian region was dominated by the Hakka; Fuzhou and Cantonese people dominated cultivation in the Third Division Sarikei-Binatang region, making Sarawak the world&#x27;s second-largest pepper producer. After the British gained control of the four states of Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, nearly two million Chinese immigrated to Perak and Selangor.
After the discovery of tin deposits in British Malaya, many Chinese immigrants worked in the tin-mining industry. As tin mines opened in Perak, many Chinese in neighbouring Penang became wealthy. Many Chinese tin-mining communities were established in the Malay Peninsula by the 1870s, particularly in Ipoh (Kinta Valley), Taiping, Seremban and Kuala Lumpur (Klang Valley). Each of the mining communities was governed by a Kapitan Cina, with duties and privileges similar to those in Johor&#x27;s Kangchu system. Chinese migration sprang from poverty in rural China and employment opportunities in the British colonies or protectorates, and an estimated five million Chinese had immigrated by the 19th century. Despite economic prosperity after immigration, the new Chinese communities split into a number of secret societies. This exacerbated political unrest among the Malay aristocracy, which enlisted help from the secret societies. Contemporary local Malay politics was characterised as anarchy and civil war between people from similar backgrounds, prompting alliances between senior Malay political leaders and officials from China and Europe who were protecting their investments.

=== Divided nationalism and turbulence (1900–1945) ===

Civil wars and other conflicts among the indigenous ethnic groups ended when the British gained control of Malaya and the northern island of Borneo by the 1900s. However, none of the Malay kingdoms fell under colonial rule. Their related entities were politically and economically stable. Economic prosperity was fueled by British capital and Chinese and Indian work forces who expanded and supplied tin and rubber production. Before the 1911 Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Qing dynasty in China, Tongmenghui leader Sun Yat-sen raised funds and organisational support from overseas Chinese communities (primarily in French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Siam, British Singapore, Malaya and Borneo) and began Nanyang organising activities in Saigon, Hanoi, Pontianak, Manila, Bangkok, Singapore and George Town. Competition arose among three groups, with each group targeting overseas Chinese (particularly in Malaya and Singapore) for support. One group was a pro-Qing elite who targeted wealthy Chinese; the other two were reformists and revolutionaries who advocated constitutional reforms, the introduction of a parliamentary system, and the overthrow of Qing and Manchu influence on a modern Chinese nation.
After the revolution which established the Republic of China, branches of the Kuomintang emerged in British Malaya. Kuomintang activities in British Borneo were coordinated by the Democratic Party of North Borneo, consisting of Chinese-educated towkays. Patriotism among Chinese immigrant communities focused on China. British colonial authorities initially did not object to Kuomintang membership. A communist movement developed among overseas Chinese by 1925 with the establishment of the South Seas Communist Party in Singapore, followed by the Indochinese Communist Party, Communist Party of Malaya, Communist Party of Burma and Communist Party of Siam; the movement also maintained relations with the earlier, Southeast Asian Communist Party of Indonesia. The Communist Party of Malaya followed the general communist policy of opposing Western democracies before World War II, increasing propaganda against the Malayan government and the colonial government of Singapore in 1940.
At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict and the Japanese occupation of Malaya and British Borneo, Kuomintang activities were ended. When the Chinese Communist Party (under Mao Zedong) reached an agreement with the Kuomintang government (under Chiang Kai-shek) to put aside their differences and rally against Japanese aggression in July 1940, pro-independence sentiment led to bans on the Kuomintang and other Chinese organizations in Malaya. Since the conflict with Japan also involved the British, Chiang Kai-shek urged Kuomintang members to fight alongside them; in return, British colonial authorities lifted their ban of Chinese associations (including the Kuomintang and the Chinese communist movement). This, and British recognition of the Communist Party of Malaya, resulted in the formation of the guerrilla Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) in 1941. The MPAJA (primarily consisting of ethnic Chinese in Malaya) waged a guerrilla war against the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) with 10,000 men in eight battalions, and contacted the British Force 136. Local Kuomintang revolts, such as the Jesselton uprising in British Borneo, were suppressed by the Kenpeitai.

Much Chinese underground anti-Japanese activity in North Borneo was part of the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement, led by Tan Kah Kee; in Sarawak, activities were coordinated by the Sarawak Anti-Fascist League. The MPAJA was disbanded after the 1945 Allied victory in the Pacific, and many of its leaders were commended by the British. It began to massacre perceived collaborators (primarily Malay) after it was disbanded, however, sparking a Malay backlash. The MPAJA also targeted British posts, with several grenade attacks on British troops. In North Borneo, the Chinese co-operated with the British and pledged loyalty to King George VI when the Crown Colony of North Borneo was formed after the war.

=== Postwar unrest and social integration (1946–1962) ===
With the MPAJA renamed as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), communist insurgents used guerrilla tactics in the jungles, sabotaged transportation networks and attacked British plantations (assassinating several European plantation owners). British intelligence estimated MNLA support at about 500,000, out of a total Chinese population of 3.12 million; battling the insurgents was difficult, since most hid in inaccessible jungles. With the 18 June 1948 declaration of the Malayan Emergency, the early government response was chaotic; its primary aim was to guard important economic targets. Most Malayan Chinese opposed the MNLA.
The 1950 Briggs Plan, devised by British general Harold Briggs, intended to isolate the Chinese population from the insurgents. Independence was promised, and supported by the Malays; the Chinese population feared being treated as second-class citizens in an independent Malaya. In addition to new villages, the plan included labour reorganisation, the deployment of troops throughout Malaya, and cooperation between the police, the army, and intelligence. Under the resettlement scheme, more than 700,000 rural Chinese communities were relocated in 582 new government settlements. After British high commissioner Henry Gurney died in a 1951 ambush, Gerald Templer are appointed as the new high commissioner for Malaya by Winston Churchill the following year; Templer preferred winning hearts and minds to military measures against the insurgents. As part of his campaign, Templer incentivised rebel surrender and used strict curfews and tight control of food supplies in involved areas to flush them out. Crops grown by insurgents were sprayed with herbicides and defoliants, and restrictions were lifted in areas free of insurgents by elevating them to &quot;white status&quot;. In the Batang Kali massacre, 24 unarmed Malaysian civilians suspected of providing aid to the MNLA were shot by a Scots Guard division in late 1948.
According to Chin Peng, the success of Templer&#x27;s campaign was primarily due to the Briggs Plan&#x27;s resettlement programme; Gurney also introduced a quasi-ministerial system, with a bill to increase the number of non-Malays eligible for citizenship after independence. After the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution, foreign missionaries in China were forced to leave; Templer invited them to Malaya to provide spiritual healing, medical education and welfare measures to residents of the new government villages. By September 1952, every person born in Malaya (includes 1.2 million Chinese) was granted full citizenship.
When the Federation of Malaya gained independence from the British in 1957, there was still an insurgency. Chinese communists who surrendered were given a choice of repatriation to China or declaring loyalty to the elected government of Malaya and renouncing communist ideology. The anti-communist campaign continued until 1960, when the Malayan government declared the end of its state of emergency after Chin Peng demobilized his forces and left his hide-out in southern Thailand for Beijing via North Vietnam. At a meeting of Chin and Deng Xiaoping in Beijing, China urged the Communist Party of Malaya to continue their armed struggle. The establishment of a communist government in mainland China affected Chinese youth in Sarawak, who organized the pro-Beijing Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League (later the Sarawak Advanced Youth Association, which sparked the 1960 communist insurgency in Sarawak. Malaysia&#x27;s economy continued to prosper, dependent on tin and rubber industries dominated by a Chinese and Indian workforce.

=== Struggle for equality in &quot;Malaysian Malaysia&quot; (1963–1965) ===

Early in 1961, when Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman outlined a &quot;Grand Malaysian Alliance&quot; of the British protectorate of Brunei and the crown colonies of North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew supported the proposal. Lee&#x27;s People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) rallied for the equality of all Malaysians, regardless of &quot;class, skin colour or creed&quot;, known as &quot;Malaysian Malaysia&quot;, in a multi-ethnic society without Malayisation. Although Lee was seen by Malay extremists in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), as opposed to &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; after the 1963 formation of Malaysia, he had adopted Malay as Singapore&#x27;s national language and appointed Malay Yusof Ishak as Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), led by Tan Cheng Lock and part of the Malaysian Alliance Party, refused to join the struggle for equality. The MCA feared that equality would disrupt an agreement between the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in which Malays were politically dominant and the Chinese controlled the country&#x27;s economy; Malaysian Indians played a smaller economic role, with the Malays promising to share future political power with the other two groups. After two years as part of the federation and the enactment of Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia, Lee was joined by the Malay Peninsula&#x27;s United Democratic Party and People&#x27;s Progressive Party and Sarawak&#x27;s United Peoples&#x27; Party and Machinda Party in the Malaysian Solidarity Convention to campaign for equality. In a June 1965 speech at the MSC meeting in Singapore, Lee said:

Lee&#x27;s call for a re-alignment of forces between those who wanted a &quot;true Malaysian nation&quot; and those who preferred a country led by a component of the Alliance Party, and his criticism of Malays advocating Malay dominance, led to bitter PAP–UMNO relations and the 1964 race riots in Singapore; Singapore was later expelled from the federation in August 1965, and became its own sovereign nation.

=== Communist insurgencies and racial clashes (1965–1990) ===
The struggle for equality continued with the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which succeeded the PAP in 1965. Many Malaysian Chinese began to view the Malaysian Chinese Association as more concerned with business and economic interests than social factors, although Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman considered the MCA the sole legitimate representative of the federation&#x27;s Chinese community. In 1968, communists supported by China began a new insurgency from their stronghold in southern Thailand. The following year, the MCA was challenged by the DAP and the Malaysian People&#x27;s Movement Party (GERAKAN). Of its 33 parliamentary seats contested in the election, the MCA retained 13 and lost control of the Penang state government to GERAKAN; Chinese-Malay tensions culminated in the 13 May incident. Other clashes were also ethnic in nature.

In the aftermath of the riots, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman blamed the communists rather than racial issues and said that the Vietnam War in their neighbour was &quot;not simply a civil war but communist-ideology expansion&quot;. The Malaysian government introduced several policy initiatives in security and development, a neighbourhood-watch program and the People&#x27;s Volunteer Corps. The Communist Party of Malaya split into two factions during the early 1970s: a revolutionary wing in 1970 and a Marxist–Leninist wing in 1974. Kuala Lumpur and Beijing established diplomatic relations in 1974; China ended its aid to the factions, prompting their 1983 merger into the Malaysian Communist Party before their surrender to Thai authorities four years later and the 1989 peace agreement ending the insurgency. A Chinese communist insurgency in Sarawak, supported by neighboring Indonesia, ended with peace negotiations in 1990.

=== 1990 to present ===
Issues between the Malaysian Chinese and the Malays remain unresolved. The failure of Malaysia&#x27;s social contract has led to a strong Chinese identity, in contrast to the Chinese communities in neighbouring Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. After the 1969 racial clashes, the Malaysian New Economic Policy favouring the Malays from 1971 to 1990 increased &quot;Bumiputera&quot; economic control by 60 percent. Malaysian Chinese remain the business sector&#x27;s dominant players; equity ownership doubled from 22.8 percent in 1969 to 45.5 percent in 1990, and nearly all of Malaysia&#x27;s richest people are Chinese.

Since Malaysian Chinese manage the country&#x27;s economy, most (75.8 percent in 1991) live in urban areas. They generally do not speak Malay among themselves; this contrasts with earlier Chinese communities such as the Straits-born Chinese of Baba-Nyonya, Kelantanese and Terengganuan Peranakans, Penangite Hokkien and Sabah Sino-natives, who mingled with local Malay and other indigenous peoples. Chinese in East Malaysia in Sabah and Sarawak, particularly in small inland towns, interact more closely with the indigenous communities. Integration issues in present-day Malaysia are largely inherited from Malayan racial politics, in which ethnic communities consolidated into a single political community. Malaysia&#x27;s contemporary educational and social policies has created a Chinese brain drain to developed countries, especially Singapore. The country has experienced a slight wave of Mandarin-speaking immigrants from northeastern China and a smaller number of Vietnamese immigrants, however, with local men marrying women from China and Vietnam.

== Origins and social demographics ==
Since their early ancient trade connection and subsequent migrations, the majority of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are ethnic Han from the historical areas of Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China. Nearly all ethnic Chinese Malaysians living in the country today are either patrilineal descendants of these early immigrants, or new immigrants born in mainland China. Among the first group from the first migration wave are the Peranakans in Kelantan and Terengganu, Sino-Natives in Sabah and Straits-born Chinese (Baba-Nyonya) in Malacca and Penang. The Taiping Rebellion in the mid-19th century caused much chaos and suffering in southern China, which led many ethnic Chinese civilians to seek refuge overseas, particularly to the Nanyang region (Southeast Asia) in further south. With the expanding British colonial ambitions in the region which led to the establishment of Straits Settlements, more migrants were attracted and the region became an important destination for Chinese emigration.
By the late 19th century with the second wave of migration through the British colonial rule, the Hokkien of southern Fujian led by many of their wealthy and powerful individuals with skills in finance and maritime shipping became the dominant immigrant group as the first group of ethnic Chinese to settle in large numbers with their language become a contact language among Chinese of different linguistics background. The Cantonese from Guangdong follow suit and became well known as mineworkers, land reclamation, mechanics and their familiarity with cash cropping. Another large group, the Hakka are mostly hill farmers originated from northeastern Guangdong and various southern China places who specialise in forest clearance, mining as well on metalworking. Other groups like the Teochew from Chaozhou of eastern Guangdong are mainly on plantation agriculture, the Fuzhou from central Fujian specialise in entrepreneurship, while the Hainanese from Hainan as one of the ethnic Chinese minority saw themselves as sojourners with many of Hainanese chefs and waiters ruled the kitchen of local Chinese kopi tiam and restaurants. The Henghua and Hokchia from eastern Fujian are usually managing family industries while the Kwongsai from Guangxi are employed in labour sectors. Followed by the third wave of ethnic Chinese migration thereafter, this resulted from Malaysia as being one of the countries outside China and Taiwan with largest population of Chinese speakers in the world. Following the establishment of diplomatic relationship between Mainland China and Malaysia in 1974, a joint communiqué was made between the two nations, which stated:

=== Distribution of Han ethnic subgroups ===

Different Chinese dialects are spoken in Malaysian cities and towns. Across the country, Mandarin has emerged as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the various Chinese dialect groups, largely due to its use as the language of instruction in Chinese schools and China&#x27;s increasing economic influence.

Within Peninsular Malaysia, Hokkien is predominantly spoken in west coast cities such as George Town, Seberang Perai, Klang, Malacca, Batu Pahat and Muar. In contrast, Cantonese is the main dialect in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Seremban and Kuantan. Interior towns like Cameron Highlands and Kulai were primarily Hakka-speaking. Teochew was also commonly used along the western coast of Perak and in Johor Bahru. Bentong and Raub contained a substantial Kwongsai-speaking population.

The distribution of Chinese dialects in East Malaysia exhibits significant variation. In Sabah, Hakka is the predominant dialect, particularly in Kota Kinabalu, Lahad Datu, Semporna, Papar and Tawau. In Sarawak, Hakka is also prevalent in towns such as Serian, Kota Samarahan and Bau. Cantonese serves as the main dialect in Miri and Sandakan. Kuching and Kapit contained multiple dialect groups, including Hokkien, Hakka and Fuzhou. The town of Sibu was often referred to as a mini-Fuzhou, with the dialect also being used in Sarikei.
The first census conducted in 1970 after Malaysia was formed in 1963 reported that there were 3,555,879 ethnic Chinese Malaysians, with the Hokkien or Min Nan (福建人 or 闽南人) being the majority at 32.4%, followed by Hakka (客家人) at 22.1%, Cantonese (广府人) at 19.8%, Teochew (潮汕人) and Hainanese (海南人) at 12.4% and 4.7% respectively. This increase to 4,554,664 in 1980 and 4,623,900 in 1991. In 2000, the census reported that ethnic Chinese Malaysians numbered at 5,691,908, which was approximately 24.45% of the country&#x27;s population at the time, with 86% of them living in urban areas. In West Malaysia, Hokkien became the leading group followed by Cantonese, Hakka and Teochew. The pattern differs in East Malaysia where Hakka is the majority in Sabah and Sarawak followed by Hokkien and Cantonese in Sabah and the Fuzhou (福州人), Hokkien and Teochew in Sarawak. The population increased further to 6,392,636 by 2010 and 6,892,367 by 2020. , over three-fifths of Malaysia&#x27;s ethnic Chinese resided in Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Penang also had the largest percentage of Chinese and was the only state where the Chinese constituted a plurality.

There is also a small community of &quot;Huáběi-ren&quot; (Northern Chinese or 华北人) in Sabah whose ancestors coming from various parts of Hebei (河北) and Shandong (山东) provinces in China with most of them calling themselves as &quot;Tiānjīn-ren&quot; (天津人 or 津侨). Besides that, Sanjiang-ren () is a collective term used to categorise the group of people whose ancestors hailed from Shanghai (上海), Zhejiang (浙江), Jiangsu (江苏), Hubei (湖北) and Jiangxi (江西). It is a subgroup of mixed spoken dialects and has the fewest people as compared to other Chinese subgroups. The first San Jiang Clansmen Association or San Kiang Association was formed in Penang back in 1897.

Although the ethnic Chinese population had been increasing since the 1970s, their proportion within the total population had been decreasing gradually, particularly caused by the lower birth rate among the Chinese community.

=== Economic, demographic and political representation ===
Ethnic Chinese Malaysians have been traditionally dominant in the business sector of the Malaysian economy with large local Chinese enterprises involved in natural resources and food ingredients industries such as sugar and palm oil. Almost every biscuits manufacturer in the country is dominated by ethnic Chinese Malaysians. Up to the 1970s, their economic structure was intertwined with very much family and kinship ties. By the 21st century with the rising of China&#x27;s economic influence, their economy network are jointly connected with other Overseas Chinese through the bamboo network. The local Chinese played a key role in facilitating China&#x27;s capital to invest in Malaysia while in the process both benefited from expanded markets, lower labour costs and the introduction of different kind of technologies and managerial systems which resulted from Malaysia becoming the largest trading partner to China in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Nevertheless, unlike the more transboundary business influence by neighbouring Chinese Singaporeans, a majority of Chinese Malaysian businesses are still seen as less concentrating on developing business ties with other Southeast Asian Chinese businessmen despite there have been few businesses made by several local Malaysian Chinese companies.

Since the country&#x27;s foundation in 1963, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was the sole legitimate political representation for ethnic Chinese in Malaysia under the multi-racial political coalition of the Alliance Party (later expanded into National Front coalition). However, the growing restriction of non-Malay interests in Malaysian society and politics since the 1970s caused deep dissension among Chinese Malaysians. The perception that their ethnic party representatives were unable to stand for their people&#x27;s rights grew, and that decision-making was influenced by the Malay supremacists dominated party of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The UMNO was the most influential part of the existing political coalition, and also championed Islamic values. Despite the coalition&#x27;s multi-racial appearance, UMNO founding president Onn Jaafar has once said that their movement did not adhere to any ideology other than &quot;Malayism&quot;, defined by Malay scholar Ariffin Omar as the belief that the interests of the Malay race must be upheld over anything else. From 1968, the inability of MCA to preserve ethnic Chinese Malaysian interests, particularly with regards to their culture, education, and language, resulted in the formation of another ethnic Chinese representative party, the Malaysian People&#x27;s Movement Party (GERAKAN) led by Chinese overseas-educated elite, although this party also joined the Alliance Party coalition in 1972.

The growing Islamisation with &quot;Islamic version of non-tolerant and open&quot;, increasing racism within the Malay party members throughout the coalition imposing further into the country social demographics as well as the government discriminative policies on their education and employment, caused further disenchantment among non-Malays, especially ethnic Chinese. This subsequently caused dwindling support from ethnic Chinese Malaysians when many original strongholds of MCA constituents and even Gerakan turned to the Democratic Action Party (DAP) as the latter were seen as more vocal on their rights. The recent country general election in 2018 saw the fall of National Front coalition following additional aid from Bornean parliamentary seats particularly in Sabah that were won by Pakatan Harapan coalition ally of regionalist Sabah Heritage Party (WARISAN) as well from another indigenous party of United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO) as a result of similar growing frustration over long-time manipulation of the state demographics and resources with lack of development through the administration of the Malay-led supremacists government of UMNO with frequent labelling as &quot;fixed deposit state&quot;. During the election, the DAP won a large amount of seats due to the support of many Chinese constituents and subsequently diminished MCA influence among ethnic Chinese Malaysians.

Although the Malaysian Chinese population is increasing in every census, the proportion of ethnic Chinese among the country&#x27;s total population has been declining in recent decades because of a lower birth rate and high emigration rate. There are significant concerns about the loss of political representation. According to a report by the World Bank, the Malaysian diaspora around the world in 2010 included around a million people, most of them ethnic Chinese. The large number of emigrants, many of whom are young with education or skills, constitutes a significant &quot;brain drain&quot; from the country, especially towards the country&#x27;s immediate neighbour Singapore.

=== Contributions towards local medical practice ===

Aside from their economic dominance, ethnic Chinese Malaysians are known for their contribution in the country healthcare sectors with their traditional health practice. Around 3,000 medicine shops in the country sell traditional Chinese medicine with development support also given by the country Health Ministry. Chinese traditional health practice services in the country generally encompass the &quot;zhong yi 中医&quot; (Chinese medicine), &quot;qigong&quot; (气功), chiropractic care (整骨), acupuncture (针灸) and several others. In 2012, the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Bill (T&amp;CM) was passed by the Parliament of Malaysia for the establishment of &quot;Traditional and Complementary Medicine Council or Majlis Perubatan Tradisional dan Komplementari&quot; to register and regulate traditional and complementary medicine practitioners, including traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as well Malay, indigenous and Indians traditional medicine which followed by the enforcement of T&amp;CM Act in the following year. Since most of the traditional medicine pharmacies are family-apprentice trade, most of the traditional medicine practitioners are not registered as a doctor under the health department despite the support given by the Health Ministry with most can practice the career without needed to be registered under government law.

=== Education ===
In educational aspects, Malaysia is the only country outside China and Taiwan with a comprehensive and complete Chinese education system and the only Southeast Asian country that has perpetuated the Chinese education system established since the colonial era as a result of heavy brokerage and lobbying efforts by ethnic Chinese Malaysians political leaders with continual funding from local Chinese communities. The first Chinese schools had been established in the country in the 19th century during the British colonial administration. At the same time, Christian missions from China also founded schools for Chinese students to nurture Church workers, this are most notable among many Chinese Christians of Hakka origin in Sabah and the Fuzhou in Sarawak. Following the country&#x27;s independence, some of the Chinese independent schools who were influenced by the new national agenda and desperately needed government financial support were willingly converted into English medium-schools. However, these schools were later scrupulously converted into Malay medium-schools following the massive elimination of English medium-schools by the Malay-dominated regime in the 1970s in an effort to impose the Malay language as the only medium of instructions in all schools in the aftermath of ethnic riots in 1969. The following period was considered a dark time for local Chinese education and witnessed a growing belief in the idea that the ethnic Chinese in Malaysia had to proceed on a basis of self-reliance and vigilance in order to preserve their language rights as the national education policy was seen as exclusionary and discriminatory for non-Malays, summed up in the aphorism &quot;non-Malays belong to Malaysia but Malaysia only belongs to the Malays&quot;.
Although other remaining Chinese independent schools or 独中 were also included in the national school system in 1996, these independent schools still did not receive any financial assistance from the federal government and its United Examinations Certificate (UEC) or 统考 is not recognised by the government, making students who finish their studies from the local Chinese independent schools unable to enroll in government-funded public tertiary institutions. Since late 1970, ethnic Chinese Malaysians had expanded their own Mandarin-language primary schools where around 90% of their children were enrolled based on the figures from 2006. These schools gained a reputation for not only maintaining good discipline but also providing the high-quality education that the Malay schools were seen by some to lack. This perceived superiority attracted significant interest among Bumiputera parents with various analyses placing the number of Bumiputera students enrollment in Chinese schools between 60,000 and 100,000 in 2000. The federal government&#x27;s failure to impose Malay as the sole unifying language throughout the country&#x27;s educational systems unlike in China with Standard Chinese or Indonesia with Indonesian language are mainly attributed to the racial-based policy enforcement of ethnic inclusion and exclusion. Some argue that the educational policies imposed by the federal government over the years in regard to minority language education have created negative consequences for Malaysian youth: a mounting brain drain in particular. A study from 2000 found that the country had lost an ample amount of talented and skilled youth to other more favourable countries as the result of students from the large non-Malay minority language communities being forced to go to university abroad because they did not attend Malay language schools.

== Culture ==


Chinese cultural influences made their mark when ancient trade relations were established with the Nanyang (南洋) region. The massive ethnic Chinese migration during the British colonial period causing a subsequent strong influence on the country&#x27;s culture, including in cuisine and the language. Aside from the Chinese cultural influence on local culture, ethnic Chinese from the first wave migration before English arrival had mainly adopted a localised culture. The Baba-Nyonya in Malacca had a very strong Malay influence in their clothing and food although still maintaining their Chinese heritage of religion, name, and identity. Their food are made with Malay ingredients and recipes but produced using the Chinese method while their houses are constructed with the infusion of Victorian, Chinese and Malay elements. Together with the Peranakans in Penang, both sides use a mixture of Hokkien and Malay despite the Penang Peranakans speak mainly Hokkien with some borrowed words from Malay words while in Malacca, the Peranakans have adopted Malay patois with some Hokkien words. The food prepared by Penang Peranakans also infuses both Chinese and Malay elements, albeit with an additional Thai influence. The Peranakans in the east coast of Malaysia in Kelantan and Terengganu have much closer ties with the Malay and Siamese community there since most of them has adopted the Malay and Siamese lifestyle.

Further, close blood relations between ethnic Chinese and local indigenous in northern Borneo since the early kingdoms period produced the &quot;Sino-Natives&quot; persons in Sabah as a result of inter-marriage between ethnic Chinese there and natives of Sabah. Instead of speaking Chinese languages, these communities spoke the localized Sabah Malay dialect as their main &quot;lingua franca&quot; since the 14th century. The close relations are marked with earliest records of the &quot;Kina&quot; term which is widely used by the indigenous Dusun to refer to the Chinese ethnicity including for the Dusun homeland mountain of &quot;Mount Kinabalu&quot; (Chinese widow mountain), &quot;Kinabatangan River&quot; (Chinese river) and several other places such as the Kinabalu mountain stream of &quot;Kinataki&quot;, a small river in the northeastern coast of &quot;Kinabañgun&quot; and a Chinese land in Labuan Island, the &quot;Kinabenua&quot;. The Na Tuk Kong shrine for example shown another sign of assimilation with local culture, where it refers to local Malay guardian spirits worshipped by some ethnic Chinese in West Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore and Indonesia. The term &quot;Na Tuk&quot; originated from the Malay word of &quot;Datuk&quot; (grandfather) which then merged with &quot;Kong&quot; (公, sometimes addressed as &#x27;Kung&#x27; meaning elderly male), similar with Tu Ti Kung (), an earth deity worshipped in East Asia.

=== Cuisine ===
The ethnic Chinese cuisine in Malaysia is derived from the culinary traditions of their early immigrants and descendants, who have adopted or modified their culinary traditions under the influence of Malaysian culture. Additionally due to the immigration of Chinese to the country, Chinese cuisine has now become an inseparable part in the country’s cultural mixture. When Chinese merchants sailed their junks across the South China Sea, they visited ports in Borneo and Malacca, which had a profound influence on the region. Since the local king at that time enjoyed Chinese cuisine, the traders would bring along cooks with them to the island. They introduced ingredients in Chinese cooking such as noodles, bean sprouts, tofu and soy sauce which are by now widely used by every ethnic group in the country. Apart from introducing new ingredients , these earlier traders also discovered ingredients among the local population along the coast, such as the expensive edible bird&#x27;s nest with the best quality nests claiming to come from Borneo. Since a vast majority of Chinese Malaysians today are descendants of immigrants from southern China, local Chinese cuisine is predominantly based from Fujian, Cantonese, Hakka and Teochew cuisines. Their technique of stir frying ingredients and adding a small portion of cooking oil over high heat in a wok (锅) is widely adopted among the nation.

Chinese Malaysian cuisine had developed a strong penchant for spices and chillies where any local Chinese kopi tiam or restaurant will offer pickled green or red chillies &quot;sambal&quot; for noodles and rice-based meals. They borrowed curry leaves from the Indians and have since adapted English Worcestershire sauce and tomato sauce along with Indian and Malay spices to the cooking pot. Among the notable Chinese dishes in the country including the &quot;bak kut teh&quot; (肉骨茶) (pork rib soup with Chinese herbs), &quot;char kway teow&quot; (炒粿条) (stir fried rice noodle), &quot;dim sum&quot; (点心) (ready-to-serve dishes), &quot;hae mee&quot; (虾面) (spicy prawn noodle soup served in savoury broth), Hainanese chicken rice (海南鸡饭), &quot;kai si hor fun&quot; (鸡丝河粉) (flat rice noodle soup with chicken slices, shrimps and bean sprouts), &quot;kolok or kolo mee&quot; (干捞面) (Sarawakian egg noodle served in dark sauce, tomato sauce or chilli sauce), &quot;lor mee&quot; (卤面) (thick yellow noodle served in dark sauce and thick broth), &quot;ngiu chap mee&quot; (牛杂面) (special Sabah mixed beef noodle), &quot;pan mee&quot; (板面) (handmade noodle soup served with pork balls, minced pork, dried anchovies, black fungus and vegetable), &quot;sang nyuk mee&quot; (生肉面) (special Sabah dry pork noodle or pork noodle soup), &quot;wonton mee&quot; (云吞面) (dry noodle or noodle soup served with BBQ pork, minced pork and pork or shrimp dumplings) and &quot;yong tau foo&quot; (酿豆腐) (tofu and mixed vegetables filled with ground pork mixture or fish paste). Many Chinese Malaysians also can cook Malay-style chicken or fish with most versions of &quot;laksa&quot; (叻唦) are prepared by them. Some examples of basic Chinese Malaysians drinks that are commercially produced in the country include the black tea, chrysanthemum tea, grass jelly, green tea, jasmine tea, soy milk and white coffee while popular snacks including the &quot;cakoi&quot; (油炸鬼) (long deep-fried dough), egg tart, &quot;hum ji peng&quot; (咸煎饼) (circle shaped fried dough with or without fillings), &quot;ngoi sing tart&quot; (外星塔) (UFO shaped tart), &quot;ngo hiang&quot; (炸五香) (various spiced, minced meat rolls prepared in deep fried style and served with vegetables), &quot;pau&quot; (包) (steamed buns), &quot;popiah&quot; (薄饼) (fried or plain spring rolls filled with mixed vegetables), and &quot;tau sar piah&quot; (豆沙饼) (pastry biscuits filled with a sweet or savoury filling). The legacy from the first wave migration created the Peranakan (土生华人) (including the Baba-Nyonya (峇峇娘惹)) ethnicity through a blend between Chinese and Malay which subsequently produced the Peranakan cuisine where they served Indian-style curries with eating etiquette different from mainstream ethnic Chinese society by following the Malay usage of fingers than chopsticks. The Baba-Nyonya also specialized in making a variety of local snacks called &quot;kuih&quot; which require plenty of patience and skills.

=== Dialects and languages ===

The 1970 Malaysian Census reported the Southern Min dialects being the largest which accounting for 34.2% of the country Chinese population, followed by Hakka with 22.1%, Cantonese by 19.8%, Chaozhou (Teochew) by 12.4% and Hainanese by 4.7%. In 2003, a more detailed statistics for each dialects reported the Hokkien with 2,020,914, Hakka with 1,092,835, Cantonese with 1,068,008, Teochew with 497,280, Fuzhou with 251,553, Hainanese with 141,045, Kwongsai with 51,674, Henghua with 24,654, Hockchia with 14,935 and different other ethnic Chinese with 202,977, for a total of 5,365,875. The Malaysian Hokkien are divided into two localised dialects; the Penang Hokkien (northern) comprising Penang, Kedah, Perlis and Perak, and Southern Peninsular Hokkien in Johor, Malacca and neighbouring Singapore. The northern Hokkien contains more Malay loanwords than the southern with the latter maintaining more of their original Hokkien words. Many Hokkien living in Sarawak have been influenced heavily by indigenous language similarly with Hokkien in Kelantan where their language was heavily localised following close interaction with local Malays and Siamese. Localised Hokkien also spoken primarily by the Peranakan community (Baba-Nyonya) in both Malacca and Penang. Generally, Hokkien became a contact language among ethnic Chinese of different linguistic background in most parts of Malaysia.

The Malaysian Cantonese became the contact language in the Malaysia&#x27;s capital of Kuala Lumpur albeit with a distinct phonology and grammar from standard Cantonese spoken in Pearl River Delta region of China including in Hong Kong and Macau. Hakka dialect assumes the role of contact language in Sabah but in the rest of the country the language are more commonly used as an intra-group language than a lingua franca within the Chinese community with about 66.2% of Hakka in Johor prefer localised Mandarin. Similar studies on Eastern Min speakers of Fuzhou community in Sarawak also found a general shift of language choice from their own dialect to Mandarin Chinese and English. The Chaozhou dialect despite being not a largest dialect group has become a bridge language for trade between Teochew exporters in China and wholesalers in Malaysia. Hainan dialect is another minority and the sub-dialect of the Min Chinese dialect family although it is treated in the country as an independent dialect. Several others like Henghua are also generally termed as &quot;dialects&quot;, which in fact together with the rest are variety of Chinese languages from different Chinese ethnicity. Mandarin, which is generally spoken by northern Chinese minority in Sabah become the main working language among all Chinese in the country with Standard Mandarin is used as the medium of instruction in local Chinese medium school and independent high school although the language still not necessarily spoken in their daily life practice. Based on early Malaysian Census in 1970, around 41% of ethnic Chinese Malaysians are able to converse in Mandarin.

=== Holidays and festivities ===
With the large presence of ethnic Chinese in the country nationwide, Chinese New Year is celebrated as a national public holiday. 11 states and three federal territories in the country celebrate with two days holidays while two remaining states of Kelantan and Terengganu only celebrate a one-day holiday. During the New Year, many Chinese living with their family in the urban areas will celebrate together, while some who may have family in rural areas will return for family reunions. Traditional dinner with the entire family is the most important aspect of the celebration and may include a traditional food tossing of &quot;yee sang,&quot; especially among the Cantonese. Elders will usually give the young a red envelope (&quot;ang pow&quot; or &quot;angpau&quot;). A variety of festival sweets are presented in the house for visitors. Most Chinese settlements and Chinatown streets will be decorated before the New Year with colorful lanterns. Dragon and lion dances will be performed with firecracker and fireworks shows also featured as part of the celebrations.

Chingay processions are also being held as part of the New Year festivities especially in Johor Bahru and Penang. Several other festivals are celebrated through the seasons in a year including the Dongzhi Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Hungry Ghost Festival, Lantern Festival (&quot;Chap Goh Mei&quot;), Mid-Autumn Festival, Nine Emperor Gods Festival and Qingming Festival which originated from much of Chinese folk beliefs and traditional agricultural society. Throughout the festivals, especially for major Chinese festivals such as the New Year, Hungry Ghost, and Mid-Autumn, Chinese temples will organize cultural and religious activities. The Hungry Ghost Festival is generally not observed by most &quot;Dejiao&quot; (&quot;Zi&quot;) group in Malaysia which descended directly from &quot;Dejiao&quot; association in China, it is only mainly observed by three &quot;Zi&quot; associations in Kuala Lumpur (&quot;Zi Fang Ge&quot;), Pulau Ketam (&quot;Zi Bang Ge&quot;) and Butterworth (&quot;Zi Wei Gi&quot;) with the three calling the festival as &quot;Wanyuan Shenghui&quot; than &quot;Yulan Shanghui&quot;. The Mooncake Festival is celebrated through the Mid-Autumn Festival where there people will exchange and eat mooncake. Traditional Chinese weddings remain popular to some ethnic Chinese Malaysian couples even though most have preferred the Western-influenced wearing of white wedding dresses and black jackets.

=== Religion ===

Based on the 2000 Malaysian Census, 86.6% of ethnic Chinese Malaysians adhere to Buddhism and Chinese folk religion with numerous Chinese temples and shrines visible nationwide. More detailed statistics in 2010 found a total of 5,341,687 ethnic Chinese Malaysians adhere to Buddhism, 706,479 are Christians, 218,261 practising Confucianism, Taoism and other Chinese folk religious sects, 49,320 were irreligious, 42,048 are Muslims, 14,878 are Hindus, 11,387 with unknown religion while 8,576 practising other different religion. Among the common deities worshipped by ethnic Chinese Malaysians in temples are Lord Guan (&quot;Guansheng Dijun 关圣帝君&quot;), Guan Yin (&quot;Goddess of Mercy&quot; 观世音菩萨), Dabo Gong 大伯公 (&quot;Earth Deity&quot;) and Mazu (&quot;Goddess of Sea 妈祖&quot;).

Commonly found in ethnic Chinese homes and shops are altars installed for deities of their affinities together with ancestral worship. Most of the deities are of Chinese origin but it is still common to see a few local deities. Most, if not all cities in Malaysia include the presence of Chinese Buddhist temples and societies. However, there exists towns with only Buddhist statues, although some may have one or two other Chinese deities. Other Buddhist branches of Theravāda and various Tibetan traditions (Vajrayāna) also have Chinese members and some of the buildings of these branches were built with the funds and philanthropic efforts from local Chinese Buddhists, examples being the establishment of Buddhist Maha Vihara in Kuala Lumpur and Wat Chayamangkalaram in Penang. Unlike the institutional religion of Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, ethnic Chinese who follow traditional folk religion do not have separate names for their belief and practices, as similar to the indigenous Malaysians such as Iban and the Orang Asli. They describe their religious beliefs as either &quot;bai shen&quot; or &quot;bai fo&quot; (worshipping deities) which does usually include the worshipping of Buddha since Mahayana Buddhist deities are also commonly worshipped by the followers of Chinese traditional religion.

Chinese Christians, including both Catholic and Protestants presence, are mainly visible with their active missionary activities especially among ethnic Chinese in East Malaysia, having a large proportion compared to other regions. The majority of Christians in West Malaysia also are of Chinese origin. Most early Chinese churches including Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians have their origins from missionary migrants that introduced the missions established in China to Malaysia. The number of Chinese Muslims is very small compared to Chinese Christians since the latter religion is seen as more tolerant, mainly due to the general perception that embracing Islam in Malaysia is to become Malayised, in addition to the ethnic rivalry between Malay and Chinese that makes Islam as less desirable to ethnic Chinese Malaysians. A majority of Chinese Malaysians, especially those who have received Chinese education, follow Confucian values and to a lesser extent, Taoism. Some that are more traditional may hold more conservative views on filial piety and social relations, while also consulting Chinese horoscopes as well on Chinese geomancy of &quot;feng shui&quot;. Taoist activities gain increasing interests and significance among Chinese Malaysians although it is not deeply practiced.

<doc id="693002" wikidata="Q204884" url="?curid=693002" title="Löb's theorem">
<text>In mathematical logic, Löb&#x27;s theorem states that in Peano arithmetic (PA) (or any formal system including PA), for any formula &quot;P&quot;, if it is provable in PA that &quot;if &quot;P&quot; is provable in PA then &quot;P&quot; is true&quot;, then &quot;P&quot; is provable in PA. If Prov(&quot;P&quot;) means that the formula &quot;P&quot; is provable, we may express this more formally as

:If 
:formula_1
:then 
:formula_2.

An immediate corollary (the contrapositive) of Löb&#x27;s theorem is that, if &quot;P&quot; is not provable in PA, then &quot;if &quot;P&quot; is provable in PA, then &quot;P&quot; is true&quot; is not provable in PA. For example, &quot;If formula_3 is provable in PA, then formula_3&quot; is not provable in PA.

Löb&#x27;s theorem is named for Martin Hugo Löb, who formulated it in 1955. It is related to Curry&#x27;s paradox.

==Löb&#x27;s theorem in provability logic==
Provability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of formula_5 in the given system in the language of modal logic, by means of the modality . That is, when formula_5 is a logical formula, another formula can be formed by placing a box in front of formula_5, and is intended to mean that formula_5 is provable.

Then we can formalize Löb&#x27;s theorem by the axiom

:formula_9

known as axiom GL, for Gödel–Löb. This is sometimes formalized by means of the inference rule:

:If
:formula_10
:then
:formula_11.

The provability logic GL that results from taking the modal logic K4 (or K, since the axiom schema 4, formula_12, then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.

==Modal proof of Löb&#x27;s theorem==
Löb&#x27;s theorem can be proved within normal modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.

===Modal formulas===
We will assume the following grammar for formulas:
# If formula_13 is a propositional variable, then formula_13 is a formula.
# If formula_15 is a propositional constant, then formula_15 is a formula.
# If formula_17 is a formula, then formula_18 is a formula.
# If formula_17 and formula_20 are formulas, then so are formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, formula_24, and formula_25

A modal sentence is a formula in this syntax that contains no propositional variables. The notation formula_26 is used to mean that formula_17 is a theorem.

===Modal fixed points===
If formula_28 is a modal formula with only one propositional variable formula_13, then a modal fixed point of formula_28 is a sentence formula_31 such that
:formula_32

We will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret formula_33 as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points follows from the diagonal lemma.

===Modal rules of inference===
In addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator formula_33, known as Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions:

# (necessitation) From formula_26 conclude formula_36: Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.
# (internal necessitation) formula_37: If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.
# (box distributivity) formula_38: This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.

===Proof of Löb&#x27;s theorem===

Much of the proof does not make use of the assumption formula_39, so for ease of understanding, the proof below is subdivided to leave the parts depending on formula_39 until the end. 

Let formula_41 be any modal sentence.

# Apply the existence of modal fixed points to the formula formula_42. It then follows that there exists a sentence formula_31 such that &lt;br&gt;formula_44.
# formula_45, from 1.
# formula_46, from 2 by the necessitation rule.
# formula_47, from 3 and the box distributivity rule.
# formula_48, box distributivity rule &quot; formula_49 &quot; with formula_50 and formula_51.
# formula_52, from 4 and 5.
# formula_53, internal necessitation rule.
# formula_54, from 6 and 7.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now comes the part of the proof where the hypothesis is used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# Assume that formula_10. Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if formula_41 is provable, then it is, in fact true. This is a claim of &quot;soundness&quot;.
# formula_57, from 8 and 9.
# formula_58, from 1.
# formula_59, from 10 and 11.
# formula_60, from 12 by the necessitation rule.
# formula_11, from 13 and 10.
More informally, we can sketch out the proof as follows.

# Since formula_62 by assumption, we also have formula_63, which implies formula_64.
# Now, the hybrid theory formula_65 can reason as follows: 
## Suppose formula_65 is inconsistent, then PA proves formula_67, which is the same as formula_68.
## However, formula_65 already knows that formula_70, a contradiction.
## Therefore, formula_65 is consistent.
# By Godel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem, this implies formula_65 is inconsistent. 
# Thus, PA proves formula_67, which is the same as formula_68.

==Examples==
An immediate corollary of Löb&#x27;s theorem is that, if &quot;P&quot; is not provable in PA, then &quot;if &quot;P&quot; is provable in PA, then &quot;P&quot; is true&quot; is not provable in PA. Given we know PA is consistent (but PA does not know PA is consistent), here are some simple examples:
* &quot;If formula_3 is provable in PA, then formula_3&quot; is not provable in PA, as formula_3 is not provable in PA (as it is false).
* &quot;If formula_78 is provable in PA, then formula_78&quot; is provable in PA, as is any statement of the form &quot;If X, then formula_78&quot;.
* &quot;If the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is provable in PA, then the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true&quot; is not provable in PA, as &quot;The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is true&quot; is not provable in PA (despite being true).

In Doxastic logic, Löb&#x27;s theorem shows that any system classified as a &quot;reflexive&quot; &quot;type 4&quot; reasoner must also be &quot;modest&quot;: such a reasoner can never believe &quot;my belief in P would imply that P is true&quot;, without also believing that P is true.

Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem follows from Löb&#x27;s theorem by substituting the false statement formula_81 for &quot;P&quot;.

==Converse: Löb&#x27;s theorem implies the existence of modal fixed points==
Not only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb&#x27;s theorem, but the converse is valid, too. When Löb&#x27;s theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence) formula_82 for any formula &quot;A&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)&quot; modalized in p&quot; can be derived. Thus in normal modal logic, Löb&#x27;s axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema 4, formula_83, and the existence of modal fixed points.

<text>Æthelwold () or Æthelwald (died 13 December 902) was the younger of two known sons of Æthelred I, King of Wessex from 865 to 871. Æthelwold and his brother Æthelhelm were still infants when their father the king died while fighting a Danish Viking invasion. The throne passed to the king&#x27;s younger brother (Æthelwold&#x27;s uncle) Alfred the Great, who carried on the war against the Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878.

After Alfred&#x27;s death in 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred&#x27;s son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince of the royal dynasty eligible for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong claim to the throne. He attempted to raise an army to support his claim, but was unable to get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.

The following year Æthelwold persuaded the East Anglian Danes to attack Edward&#x27;s territory in Wessex and Mercia. Edward retaliated with a raid on East Anglia, and when he withdrew the men of Kent lingered and met the East Anglian Danes at an unknown location in the Battle of the Holme on 13 December 902. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses, including the death of Æthelwold, which ended the challenge to Edward&#x27;s rule.

==Background==
In the eighth century, Mercia was the most powerful kingdom in southern England, but in the early ninth century Wessex became dominant. In the 820s King Egbert of Wessex conquered south-east England (Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex). His reign saw the beginning of Viking attacks, but Egbert and his son Æthelwulf, who succeeded in 839, were able to resist them. Æthelwulf died in 858, and he was followed by four sons in succession. King Æthelbald died in 860, and King Æthelberht in 865; Æthelwold&#x27;s father, Æthelred, then succeeded to the throne. In the same year the Viking Great Heathen Army invaded England. Within five years they had conquered Northumbria and East Anglia, and forced Mercia to buy them off. In late 870 the Vikings invaded Wessex, and in early 871 they fought armies under Æthelred and Alfred in four battles in quick succession, the last two of which Wessex lost. Æthelred died shortly after Easter that year, leaving young sons. Primogeniture was not established in this period, and it was believed that kings should be adults, so he was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred.

By 878 the Vikings had seized eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred was reduced to being a fugitive in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington. This was followed by a period of peace, and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a treaty with Guthrum, king of the East Anglian Vikings, setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the one hand, and the Danelaw on the other. Further Viking assaults in the mid 890s were unsuccessful.

==Early life==
Very little is known of Æthelwold&#x27;s immediate family. His father, Æthelred, was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred&#x27;s wife was probably the Wulfthryth who witnessed a charter as &quot;regina&quot; in 868. Æthelwold and his older brother Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred&#x27;s will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred&#x27;s death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.
After King Æthelred&#x27;s death in 871, his sons&#x27; supporters complained about Alfred keeping property that should have belonged to his nephews. Alfred justified his conduct in a preamble to his will, which probably dates to the 880s. One of Alfred&#x27;s biographers, Richard Abels, describes the text as &quot;rather tendentious&quot;, and another, Alfred P. Smyth, as &quot;ambiguous and vague – and deliberately so&quot;. Patrick Wormald views the will as &quot;one of the seminal documents of pre-Conquest history, and like many such not easily understood.&quot;

The dispute concerned property bequeathed in the will of Alfred&#x27;s father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that all of it was to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need to provide for their children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother&#x27;s children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.

In the preamble to his will, Alfred stated:
:When we now heard many disputes about the inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf&#x27;s will to our assembly at &quot;Langandene&quot;, and it was read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me – and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against any one of them because they declared what was right – that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. &quot;Now everything has come into your possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer.&quot;

Historians have taken differing views of Æthelwulf&#x27;s will. The historians Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest that Æthelwulf&#x27;s other surviving son, Æthelberht, was excluded from the arrangement because he was provided for separately in the eastern kingdom (the recently conquered south-east England), where he acted as king in 855 and 856; it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there. The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of Æthelwulf&#x27;s property. The transmission of folkland was governed by customary law, and another portion was reserved for the holder of the office of king. Keynes and Lapidge argue that Æthelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact, and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king, so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers. This plan was abandoned when Æthelbald died in 860 and the kingdom was reunited under Æthelberht, and Æthelred&#x27;s confirmation of the arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised Alfred as heir apparent.

Ann Williams comments: &quot;Æthelred virtually disinherits his children in favour of Alfred&#x27;s in the event of his own previous death, at least in respect of the lion&#x27;s share of the inheritance and therefore the kingship. This is in fact exactly what happened, and Æthelred&#x27;s sons were not pleased at the outcome.&quot; In his &quot;Life&quot; of Alfred, written in 893, Asser states three times that Alfred was Æthelred&#x27;s &quot;secundarius&quot; (heir apparent), an emphasis that in Ryan Lavelle&#x27;s view &quot;reflects sensitivity on the subject of Alfred&#x27;s succession&quot;.

Smyth argues, however, that it is unlikely that Æthelwulf intended to divide his kingdom, or that the kingship of Wessex should be inherited by the surviving brother; the joint property was probably provision for his youngest sons at a time when they appeared very unlikely to succeed to the kingship, with Æthelbald included as a residual beneficiary in case both of them died young. D. P. Kirby argues that it cannot be assumed that the disputed lands represented the greater part of the royal estates; he believes that Æthelwulf did intend to divide his kingdom, but also that it is unlikely he intended the surviving son to inherit the kingship: &quot;Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife. With three older brothers, Alfred&#x27;s chances of reaching adulthood would, one feels, have been minimal.&quot;

In his own will, Alfred left the bulk of his property to Edward, while Æthelhelm was left eight estates, and Æthelwold only three (at Godalming and Guildford in Surrey, and Steyning in Sussex), all in the less important eastern part of the kingdom. The largest of these was Steyning, Æthelwulf&#x27;s original burial place; in Patrick Wormald&#x27;s view, Alfred may have moved the body to Winchester because he was required to give the estate to Æthelwold under his agreement with Æthelred, and he did not want his nephew to have the prestige of owning his grandfather&#x27;s grave. Keynes and Lapidge comment: &quot;If only to judge from the relatively small number of estates he received, Æthelwold in particular would have had cause to be aggrieved by this allocation of property, and his resentment is shown by his rebellion against Edward soon after Alfred&#x27;s death.&quot; Smyth argues that the meeting of the king&#x27;s council, the &quot;witan&quot;, was bound to support him:
:Alfred, by [c.885] in full control of Wessex and at the height of his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the exclusion of his brother Æthelred&#x27;s heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred&#x27;s gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son&#x27;s position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the &quot;witan&quot; counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the &quot;witan&quot; at all. That it did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.
In Abels&#x27; view, Æthelred&#x27;s sons attempted to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed so as to strengthen their position in the inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the &quot;Langandene&quot; assembly was Alfred&#x27;s riposte.

Alfred also assisted his own son by promoting men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which magnified Alfred&#x27;s achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen the case for the succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold&#x27;s position was not fatally undermined by Alfred&#x27;s will. His mother had witnessed a charter as &quot;regina&quot;, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold&#x27;s status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as &quot;filius regis&quot; (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.

==Æthelwold&#x27;s Revolt==

After Alfred&#x27;s death in 899, Æthelwold made a bid for the throne. Janet Nelson comments that &quot;in the eyes of many Englishmen as well as Scandinavians this ætheling had claims stronger than Edward&#x27;s own.&quot; According to the &#x27;A&#x27; version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Æthelwold abducted a nun from her convent without the permission of King Edward and against the command of the bishop. Her identity is not known, but it must have been intended to strengthen his claim, and in the view of the historian Pauline Stafford, the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s account is biased in favour of Edward and might have been intended to delegitimise a politically important marriage. Æthelwold took her to the royal manors of Twynham (now Christchurch) and then Wimborne Minster, symbolically important as his father&#x27;s burial place, and declared that &quot;he would live or die there&quot;. Lavelle sees Wimborne as strategically significant, close to Roman roads to Dorchester and Salisbury, and at a crossing point of the rivers Allen and Stour; it was the southernmost point for control of access to western Wessex and Æthelwold may have intended a division of the kingdom.

However, when Edward&#x27;s army approached and camped at Badbury Rings, an Iron Age hill fort four miles west of Wimborne, Æthelwold was unable to gain sufficient support to meet them in battle. Leaving behind his consort, he fled to the Danes of Northumbria, who accepted him as king. Northumbrian coins were issued at this time in the name of a king called &#x27;Alwaldus&#x27;, who is thought to have been Æthelwold. Norse sagas record traditions of a Danish king Knútr, who briefly ruled Northumbria around 900. He is said to have been at first repulsed by an English king called Adalbrigt north of Cleveland, but then to have defeated him at Scarborough. In 1987, Smyth suggested that Adalbrigt could have been Æthelwold, but in 1995 Smyth put forward the alternative idea that the Northumbrian Danes accepted Æthelwold&#x27;s claim to be king of the West Saxons rather than taking him as their own king.

Æthelwold&#x27;s reign in Northumbria was short, in David Rollason&#x27;s view because Æthelwold saw it only as a base for gaining power in Wessex. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where Rollason states that he was accepted as king by the local Vikings. However, David Dumville points out that in the next year Æthelwold persuaded the Danes in East Anglia to wage war against Edward, and Dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate Viking army in Essex. In his view Æthelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of the kingdom of Wessex in order to strengthen his claim to the throne, and he succeeded in gaining the submission of the English rulers of Essex.

The East Anglian Danes joined Æthelwold in a raid on Mercia, reaching as far as the fortified burh at Cricklade on the border with Wessex. He then crossed the Thames into Wessex itself to raid Braydon. Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia, but he withdrew without engaging Æthelwold in battle. The men of Kent lingered, although according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; Edward sent seven messengers to recall them. The Danes caught up with the men of Kent to fight the Battle of the Holme. Its location is unknown but may be Holme in Cambridgeshire. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses. Æthelwold was among the leaders on the Danish side who were killed, together with Eohric, the Viking king of East Anglia, two holds (Danish noblemen), Ysopa and Oscetel, and Beorhtsige, son of the ætheling Beornoth, who was probably a kinsman of the former king of Mercia, Burgred. Kentish losses included their two ealdormen, Sigewulf and Sigehelm, and an Abbot Cenwulf.

The achievement of the Kentish contingent put Edward&#x27;s failure to engage the Danes with his whole army in a poor light. In Cyril Hart&#x27;s view: &quot;Undoubtedly there were recriminations, which appear to have continued to threaten Edward&#x27;s authority for some considerable period, especially in Kent; witness the Wessex chronicler&#x27;s anxiety to find excuses for Edward&#x27;s failure to support the Kentish contingent.&quot; Edward was later to marry Sigehelm&#x27;s daughter, Eadgifu, and Hart thinks that this may have been designed to placate his Kentish subjects.

The various texts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; give different versions of the revolt. Hart states: &quot;The oldest and more authoritative is preserved in the &#x27;B&#x27; text of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (supported in its essentials by the Latin East Anglian &quot;Chronicle&quot;); the official version in the &#x27;A&#x27; text is clearly a late revision, intended to justify King Edward&#x27;s position and to reinforce his authority.&quot; &#x27;B&#x27; describes Æthelwold as an ætheling, indicating the legitimacy of his claim for the kingship, a description omitted in &#x27;A&#x27;. &#x27;A&#x27; says that he took possession of Wimborne and Twinham without the permission of the king and his councillors, &#x27;B&#x27; against their will. &#x27;B&#x27; says that Æthelwold &quot;rode away by night&quot; from Wimborne; &#x27;A&#x27; reads &quot;stole away&quot;. According to &#x27;B&#x27;, the Northumbrian Danes accepted Æthelwold as their king, and gave allegiance to him, but this is omitted in &#x27;A&#x27;. However, none of the texts describe him as an ætheling after his flight to Northumbria, showing that his actions were no longer thought to have a claim to legitimacy. In the view of Scott Thompson Smith, the dispute was over property as well as kingship, and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; presents Edward as the successful protector of family property against outside interests.

==Legacy==
According to the historian Martin Ryan:
:What is striking about Æthelwold&#x27;s &quot;rebellion&quot; is the level and range of support he was able to draw on: he could call on allies from Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia and, probably, Mercia and Essex. For a time Æthelwold had a claim to be the most powerful ruler in England. Edward&#x27;s apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded.
In the view of James Campbell, the bias in the sources has led historians to see Æthelwold&#x27;s rebellion as a &quot;somewhat odd episode&quot;, but he had a justifiable claim to the kingship, and he was nearly successful; if he had not been killed at the Holme, he might have united England with much less warfare than ultimately proved to be necessary. &quot;Had it not been for the chances of battle and war Æthelwold might very well have been regarded as one of the greatest figures in our island&#x27;s story&quot;. Lavelle argues that &quot;it is important to acknowledge the audacity of Æthelwold&#x27;s actions&quot; and that he &quot;well deserves to be ranked amongst the &#x27;Nearly Men&#x27; of early Medieval Europe&quot;. The twelfth-century Annals of St Neots called him &quot;king of the pagans&quot;.

It is not known whether he had any descendants, but the chronicler Æthelweard was a great-great-grandson of King Æthelred, and this may have been through Æthelwold. Shashi Jayakumar suggests the rivalry between King Eadwig and his younger brother Edgar in the 950s dates back to the conflict which resulted in the Battle of the Holme. Eadwig&#x27;s wife, Ælfgifu, was probably Æthelweard&#x27;s sister, and one of Eadwig&#x27;s supporters, Byrhtnoth, may have been descended from the Mercian royal family through the ætheling Beorhtnoth, whose son Byrhtsige died fighting on Æthelwold&#x27;s side at the Holme. Opponents of Eadwig included his grandmother, Eadgifu, and Eadwig confiscated her property. In Jayakumar&#x27;s view: &quot;The emergence of Ælfgifu, descendant of the ætheling Æthelwold, did not just threaten Edgar&#x27;s position, it represented a &quot;revanche&quot; to a line and lineage with royal claims of its own ... The ancestors of Byrhtnoth and Æthelweard had in all likelihood fought together with Æthelwold on the &quot;Danish&quot; side at the Battle of the Holme, the opposite side to that which Eadgifu&#x27;s father Sigehelm had fought for.&quot; The marriage between Eadwig and Ælfgifu was dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity, and Edgar succeeded to the throne when Eadwig died without leaving children. In the view of Nick Higham, Æthelweard shows a &quot;lack of empathy&quot; for Edward in his chronicle, which Higham attributes to Edward&#x27;s victory over Æthelweard&#x27;s ancestor. Æthelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century, showing that Æthelred&#x27;s descendants held on to land and power in the century after his death. Æthelweard&#x27;s grandson, Æthelnoth, was an eleventh-century archbishop of Canterbury.

<text>Ebenezer McBurney Byers (April 12, 1880 – March 31, 1932) was an American socialite, sportsman, and industrialist. He won the 1906 U.S. Amateur in golf. He died from jawbone cancer after consuming Radithor, a patent medicine made from radium salts dissolved in water.

==Biography==

The son of industrialist Alexander Byers, Eben Byers was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s School and Yale College. He earned a reputation as a sportsman and played on the Yale Bulldogs golf team. Byers was the U.S. Amateur golf champion of 1905, after finishing runner-up in 1902 and 1903. Byers eventually became the chairman of the Girard Iron Company, which had been created by his father.

In 1927, Byers injured his arm falling from a railway sleeping berth. For the persistent pain, a doctor suggested he take Radithor, a patent medicine manufactured by William J. A. Bailey. Bailey was a Harvard University dropout who falsely claimed to be a doctor of medicine and had become rich from the sale of Radithor, a solution of radium in water which he claimed stimulated the endocrine system. He offered physicians a 1/6 kickback on each dose prescribed.

Byers began taking several doses of Radithor per day, believing it gave him a &quot;toned-up feeling&quot;, but stopped in October 1930 (after taking some 1400 doses) when that effect faded. He lost weight and had headaches, and his teeth began to fall out. In 1931, the Federal Trade Commission asked him to testify about his experience, but he was too sick to travel, so the commission sent a lawyer to take his statement at his home; the lawyer reported that Byers&#x27;s &quot;whole upper jaw, excepting two front teeth and most of his lower jaw had been removed&quot; and that &quot;All the remaining bone tissue of his body was disintegrating, and holes were actually forming in his skull.&quot;

His death on March 31, 1932, was attributed to &quot;radiation poisoning&quot; using the terminology of the time, but it was due to cancers, not acute radiation syndrome. Radium is known to emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. While alpha radiation has low penetrating ability and typically does not present a danger, ingestion of radium in the form of Radithor allowed accumulation in the bones. Without shielding provided by the skin, the highly ionizing alpha radiation was able to cause localized cell damage on an extreme level, and this is ultimately what led to Byers&#x27;s cancer and death. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a lead-lined coffin.

==Legacy==
Byers&#x27;s death received much publicity and it heightened awareness of the dangers of radioactive &quot;cures&quot;.

The Federal Trade Commission issued an order against Bailey&#x27;s business to &quot;cease and desist from various representations theretofore made by them as to the therapeutic value of Radithor and from representing that the product Radithor is harmless&quot;. He later founded the &quot;Radium Institute&quot; in New York and marketed a radioactive belt-clip, a radioactive paperweight, and a mechanism which purported to make water radioactive.

After exhuming Byers&#x27;s body in 1965, MIT physicist Robley Evans estimated Byers&#x27;s total radium intake as about 1000 μCi (37 MBq), with about half from Ra-226 and the other half from the highly radioactive mesothorium (Ra-228). Dr. Evans also studied radium dial painters and was able to study one whose intake was similar to, but somewhat higher than Byers&#x27;s.

<text>The crocodile icefish or white-blooded fish comprise a family (Channichthyidae) of notothenioid fish found in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. They are the only known vertebrates to lack hemoglobin in their blood as adults. Icefish populations are known to reside in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, as well as the continental shelf waters surrounding Antarctica. Water temperatures in these regions remain relatively stable, generally ranging from . One icefish, &quot;Champsocephalus esox,&quot; is distributed north of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. At least 16 species of crocodile icefish are currently recognized, although eight additional species have been proposed for the icefish genus &quot;Channichthys.&quot;

In February 2021, scientists discovered and documented a breeding colony of &quot;Neopagetopsis ionah&quot; icefish estimated to have 60 million active nests across an area of approximately 92 square miles at the bottom of the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. The majority of nests were occupied by one adult fish guarding an average of 1,735 eggs in each nest.

==Genera==
The following genera have been classified within the family Channichthyidae:

* &quot;Chaenocephalus&quot; 
* &quot;Chaenodraco&quot; 
* &quot;Champsocephalus&quot; 
* &quot;Channichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Chionobathyscus&quot; 
* &quot;Chionodraco&quot; 
* &quot;Cryodraco&quot; 
* &quot;Dacodraco&quot; 
* &quot;Neopagetopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Pagetopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Pseudochaenichthys&quot; 

==Diet and body size==

All icefish are believed to be piscivorous, but can also feed on krill. Icefish are typically ambush predators; thus, they can survive long periods between feeding, and often consume fish up to 50% of their own body length at one time. Maximum body lengths of have been recorded in these species.

==Respiratory and circulatory system==
Icefish blood is colorless because it lacks hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein in blood. Channichthyidae are the only known vertebrates to lack hemoglobin as adults. Although they do not manufacture hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome. The hemoglobin protein is made of two subunits (alpha and beta). In 15 of the 16 icefish species, the beta subunit gene has been completely deleted and the alpha subunit gene has been partially deleted. One icefish species, &quot;Neopagetopsis ionah,&quot; has a more complete hemoglobin beta subunit, but a still nonfunctional, hemoglobin gene.

Red blood cells (RBCs) are usually absent, and if present, are rare and defunct. Without a hemoglobin protein, oxygen is transported throughout the body by using oxygen dissolved in their plasma. The fish can live without hemoglobin due to low metabolic rates and an environmental condition of high oxygen solubility in the low temperature waters in which they live (the solubility of a gas tends to increase as temperature decreases). However, the oxygen-carrying capacity of icefish blood is less than 10% that of their relatives with hemoglobin.

Myoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein used in muscles, is also absent from all icefish skeletal muscles. However, in 10 species, myoglobin is found in heart muscle, specifically ventricles. Loss of myoglobin gene expression in icefish heart ventricles has occurred at least four separate times.

To compensate for the absence of hemoglobin, icefish have adapted

* larger blood vessels (including capillaries) and low-viscosity (RBC-free) blood to enable very high flow rates at low pressures.
* greater blood volumes (four times those of other fish)
* larger hearts with greater cardiac outputs (five times greater) compared to other fish. 
* hearts lacking coronary arteries, and the ventricle muscles are very spongy, which enables them to absorb oxygen directly from the blood they pump. 
* larger cardiac mitochondria and increased mitochondrial biogenesis to facilitate enhanced oxygen delivery by increasing mitochondrial surface area, and reducing distance between the extracellular area and the mitochondria in comparison to red-blooded notothenioids.

In the past, their scaleless skin had been widely thought to help absorb oxygen. However, current analysis shows that the amount of oxygen absorbed by the skin is much less than that absorbed through the gills. The little extra oxygen absorbed by the skin only plays a part in supplementing the oxygen supply to the heart, which receives venous blood from the skin and body before pumping it to the gills. 

==Evolution==

Icefish are considered a monophyletic group and likely descended from a sluggish demersal ancestor. The cold, well-mixed, oxygen-rich waters of the Southern Ocean provided an environment where a fish with a low metabolic rate could survive even without hemoglobin, albeit less efficiently. 

When the icefish evolved is unknown; two main competing hypotheses have been postulated. The first is that they are only about 6 million years old, appearing after the Southern Ocean cooled significantly. The second suggests that they are much older, 15–20 million years.

Although the evolution of icefish is still disputed, the formation of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is widely believed to mark the beginning of the evolution of Antarctic fish. The ACC moves in a clockwise northeast direction, and can be up to wide. This current formed 25–22 million years ago, and thermally isolated the Southern Ocean by separating it from the warm subtropical gyres to the north.

During the mid-Tertiary period, a species crash in the Southern Ocean opened up wide range of empty niches to colonize. Despite the hemoglobin-less mutants being less fit, the lack of competition allowed even the mutants to leave descendants that colonized empty habitats and evolved compensations for their mutations. Later, the periodic openings of fjords created habitats that were colonized by a few individuals. These conditions may have further allowed for the loss of myoglobin.

=== Loss of hemoglobin ===
Loss of hemoglobin was initially believed to be only an adaptation to the extreme cold environment, as the lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells decreases blood viscosity, which is itself an adaptation seen in other species adapted to cold climates. 

In refuting this original adaptive hypothesis, further analysis proposed that lack of hemoglobin, while not lethal, is not adaptive. Any adaptive advantages incurred by decreased blood viscosity are outweighed by the disadvantages that icefish must pump much more blood per unit of time to make up for the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of their blood. The high blood volume of icefish is itself evidence that the loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin alone was not advantageous for the ancestor of the icefish. Their unusual cardiovascular physiology, including large heart, high blood volume, increased mitochondrial density, and extensive microvasculature, suggests that icefish have had to evolve ways of coping with cold climates and the impairment of their oxygen binding and transport systems separately form their low iron environment.

Recent research by Corliss et al. (2019) claims that the loss of hemoglobin has adaptive value to conserve iron which is a limiting nutrient int the environments inhabited by icefish By no longer synthesizing hemoglobin, they claim that icefish are minimizing endogenous iron use. To demonstrate this, they obtained retinal samples of &quot;Champsocephalus gunnari&quot; and stained them to detect hemoglobin alpha 3&#x27;f. They found expression of hemoglobin alpha 3&#x27;f within the retinal vasculature of &quot;Champsocephalus gunnari&quot;, demonstrating for the first time that there is limited transcription and translation of a hemoglobin gene fragment within an icefish, a hemoglobin gene fragment does not contain any iron binding sites.

=== Loss of myoglobin ===
Phylogenetic relationships indicate that the nonexpression of myoglobin in cardiac tissue has evolved at least four discrete times. This repeated loss suggests that cardiac myoglobin may be vestigial or even detrimental to icefish. Sidell and O&#x27;Brien (2006) investigated this possibility. First, they performed a test using stopped flow spectrometry. They found that across all temperatures, oxygen binds and dissociates faster from icefish than it does from mammalian myoglobin. However, when they repeated the test with each organism at a temperature that accurately reflected its native environment, the myoglobin performance was roughly equivalent between icefish and mammals. So, they concluded that icefish myoglobin is neither more nor less functional than the myoglobin in other clades, meaning that myoglobin is unlikely to have been selected against. 

The same researchers then performed a survey test in which they selectively inhibited cardiac myoglobin in icefish with natural myoglobin gene expression. They found that icefish species naturally lacking cardiac myoglobin performed better without myoglobin than did fish that naturally express cardiac myoglobin and cardiac myoglobin was inhibited, suggesting that fish without cardiac myoglobin have undergone compensatory adaptation to lacking cardiac myoglobin.

=== Environmental reasons for trait fix ===

The Southern Ocean in which icefish inhabit is an atypical environment. To begin with, the Southern Ocean has been characterized by extremely cold but stable temperatures for the past 10–14 million years. These cold temperatures, which allow for higher water oxygen content, combined with a high degree of vertical mixing in these waters, means oxygen availability in Antarctic waters is unusually high. The loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin would have negative consequences in warmer environments. 

The stability in temperature may have also benefited icefish survival, as strong fluctuations in temperature would create a more stressful environment that would likely weed out weaker individuals with deleterious mutations.

Although most research suggests that the loss of hemoglobin in icefish was a neutral or maladaptive trait that arose due to a random evolutionary event, some researchers have also suggested that the loss of hemoglobin might be tied to a necessary adaptation for the icefish due to limited iron availability in ocean environments. Through hemoglobin loss, icefish may minimize their iron requirements, which could have helped the icefish survive 8.5 million years ago when Arctic diversity plummeted dramatically.

=== Cardiovascular physiology reasons for trait fix ===
While emphasis is often placed and understandably so on the importance of hemoglobin and myoglobin in oxygen delivery and use, recent studies have found that both proteins are actually also involved in the process of breaking down nitric oxide. This means that when icefish lost hemoglobin and myoglobin, it did not just mean a decreased ability to transport oxygen, but it also meant that total nitric oxide levels were elevated. Nitric oxide plays a role in regulating various cardiovascular processes in icefish, such as the dilation of branchial vasculature, cardiac stroke volume, and power output. The presence of nitric oxide also can increase angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cause muscle hypertrophy; all traits characteristics of icefish. The similarity between nitric oxide-mediated trait expression and the unusual cardiovascular traits of icefish suggests that while these abnormal traits have evolved over time, much of these traits were simply an immediate physiological response to heightened levels of nitric oxide, which may in turn have led to a process of homeostatic evolution. In addition, heightened levels of nitric oxide, an inevitable consequence following loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin, may have provided an automatic positive compensation for a decreased oxygen transport system without hemoglobin and myoglobin, thereby providing a grace period of the fixation less than desirable genetic traits; loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin.

<text>Eadgifu or Edgifu (d. in or after 951), also known as Edgiva or Ogive (), was Queen of the West Franks as the wife of King Charles the Simple. She was a daughter of Edward the Elder, King of Wessex and England, and his second wife Ælfflæd.

== Queen ==
Eadgifu was one of three West Saxon sisters married to Continental rulers: the others were Eadgyth, who married Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor and Eadhild, who married Hugh the Great. Eadgifu became the second wife of Charles the Simple (more correctly &quot;the Straightforward&quot;) King of the West Franks, whom she married between 917 and 919 after the death of his first wife. Eadgifu was mother to King Louis IV of France.

== Flight to England ==
In 923 Charles III was deposed after being defeated at the Battle of Soissons, and he was taken prisoner by Count Herbert II of Vermandois. To protect her son&#x27;s safety, Eadgifu took Louis to England in 923 and he was brought up at the court of her half-brother, King Æthelstan of England. Because of this, Louis became known as Louis d&#x27;Outremer (&quot;from over the sea&quot;). He stayed there until 936, when he was called back to France to be crowned King. Eadgifu accompanied him.

She retired to a convent in Laon. In 951, Herbert the Old, Count of Omois, abducted and married her, to the great anger of her son. She died at Soissons on 26 December in an unknown year and is not recorded after 951.

<text>Dahshur (in English often called &quot;Dashur&quot;; &quot;&quot; , &quot;Dahchur&quot;) is an ancient Egyptian pyramid complex and necropolis and shares the name of the nearby village of Manshiyyat Dahshur (Arabic: منشأة دهشور) in markaz Badrashin, Giza.

Dahshur is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is located on the Western Desert plateau at the edge of the cultivated plain, and along with the pyramid complexes at Saqqara, Abusir, and Giza, to its north, forms the pyramid fields of the ancient capital city of Memphis. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, mainly Senefru&#x27;s Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613 to 2589 BC.

==Pyramids==
The Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza; the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing to this date.

The first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name &quot;the Bent Pyramid&quot;.

Realizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. Once completed, the pyramid was considered to be a success, as it was a fully constructed, smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of , with an angle of 43 degrees. The Red Pyramid&#x27;s name derives from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.

Shortly after King Sneferu&#x27;s death a third pyramid was erected by his son Khufu. Khufu wanting to build a legacy of his own, utilized his father&#x27;s research to design and guide the building process of the third pyramid to completion (2589–2566 BC). Once completed, the pyramid was named the Great Pyramid of Giza, and it stands an astonishing tall with an angle of 52 degrees.
Another pyramid, the White Pyramid, located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it (sand on the outside and limestone on the inside). Naturally the weather caused the sand to erode from it, but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.

King Senusret III (1878–1839 BC) had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses; Sit-Hathor and Merit.

The Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

Several other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the Pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri, the archaeologist who excavated this site.

==Tombs and cemeteries==
Located closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king&#x27;s daughters (Sithathor). Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur&#x27;s pyramids. Dahshur was Egypt&#x27;s royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.

In July 2012, Dahshur&#x27;s entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 120 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim Arab clan member to death. Furthermore, during clashes another Muslim suffered head injuries and later died due to a gasoline bomb being thrown from a rooftop of a building. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.

As of January 2013, and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the 2011 uprising, the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.

==Climate==
Dahshur has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.

<text>Horde Zla (English: Hordes of Evil) is the organized Ultras group that supports Bosnian football club FK Sarajevo. The group&#x27;s logo consists of a stylized depiction of the Grim Reaper, borrowed from a Zagor comic book at the time of the group&#x27;s inception. Horde zla is one of two major football fan groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Apart from FK Sarajevo, the group also supports KK Bosna Royal and RK Bosna Sarajevo. The group&#x27;s organizational structure is fairly decentralized with many subgroups present at the stadium&#x27;s north stand – the gathering point of the club&#x27;s most loyal and passionate fans. Some of the most well known subgroups are Outlaws, Maroon Brothers, Vutrasi, Fina Gradska Raja, Stara garda and Downtown.

==History==
===Background===

From the moment FK Sarajevo was established on 24 October 1946 it quickly grew a following in the city of Sarajevo. The fact that nearly all pre-war Sarajevan clubs were banned by the new communist authorities left a large vacuum in a city that was traditionally a footballing centre in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The majority of fans stemmed from the numerous downtown Sarajevan Baščaršija, Stari grad and Centar neighbourhoods predominantly inhabited by Bosniaks. This is not to say that other ethnicities did not support the club. They did in huge numbers, but the history of organized support for the club is nevertheless closely tied to the aforementioned neighbourhoods. The only major Sarajevan football club not banned by the post-war authorities was FK Željezničar, based in the Grbavica neighbourhood of the city, which would go on to become the maroon-white&#x27;s biggest rival. FK Sarajevo supporters were historically known as &quot;Pitari&quot; while an individual was, and is still known as a &quot;Pitar&quot;. The nickname, meaning a consumer of the local Bosnian dish pita, was originally a derogatory label given by fans of working class Željezničar that implied the upper-class background of most FK Sarajevo supporters. This notion was based on the fact that the old downtown neighbourhoods of the city were the traditional centres of commerce and artisanship, even though the socioeconomic landscape of the city had dramatically changed by the time the club was formed. FK Sarajevo being formed by the post-war communist authorities also meant that the club garnered support from the political and party establishment of the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina which created a specific symbiosis between the progressive state establishment and the traditional, conservative Sarayevan Mahala.

===Beginnings===

The first contours of organized support for the club were drawn out in the late 1950s when the eastern stand of the Koševo stadium drew in the most ardent of supporters. As Sarajevo folklore stipulates, no footballer was ever fully accepted by the eastern stand which was for decades known as a polygon for the city&#x27;s particular sense of humour and as the main proving ground for every player wearing the maroon and white jersey. The legendary east stand was generally a meeting point for residents of the Sarajevan mahalas that would picnic with their friends, relatives and neighbours while watching matches, only fully supporting players that stemmed from the city&#x27;s downtown neighbourhoods – a particular form of local patriotism that has, in a way, survived until today. By the mid 1980s, the eastern stand&#x27;s rowdiness during matches of the time provoked large media coverage. During a league tie against Red Star Belgrade on 17 April 1986 it was reported that a maroon painted snake, reported by some as being a specimen of the venomous horned viper, was thrown off the eastern stand onto the visitors bench. This was never verified by the police or club, while other rumours in circulation stated that the incident against Red Star was caused by someone from the crowd hitting the referee with a large stone. Again, this rumour was never verified either and has in subsequent years become an urban legend, as is the case with the snake rumour. Nevertheless, alarmed by constant incidents and media coverage, the club management headed by then Director Svetozar Vujović opened the north stand of the Koševo stadium to the most fanatical of fans.

The north stand was traditionally not very popular with the footballing public, but was found to be the most adequate because it was the farthest from the field. This move coincided with the Ultras subculture reaching the Former Yugoslavia in the mid 1980s, and finding fertile ground among both members of the Punk and Mod subcultures and non-affiliated football supporters. Soon after, Horde Zla came into being. Namely, several prominent FK Sarajevo supporters of the younger generation, influenced by the Ultras subculture decided to meet, as the story goes, in an alternative nightclub of the time known as &quot;AG&quot; and create a new identity based on a popular Zagor comic book of the same name. Soon enough, Horde Zla became one of the most popular youth organizations in the city of Sarajevo. By the end of the 1980s Horde zla had become one of the five largest and most organized fan groups in SFR Yugoslavia, alongside Delije, Grobari, Torcida Split and Bad Blue Boys, out-marching to all of FK Sarajevo&#x27;s matches across the country and travelling to Italy in support of Yugoslavia during the 1990 World Cup. At this time the group also became known for some of the most infamous examples of football violence in the country, including the 1991 stabbing of two FK Partizan supporters in front of the JNA Stadium in Belgrade and the 1989 riots in the city of Mostar before a league fixture against Velež, resulting in the stabbing of a local resident and the destruction of huge amounts of public and private property. While most other Ultra firms in Yugoslavia popularized and marketed the growing nationalist fervor that would lead to the Yugoslav Wars, Horde Zla mostly stayed apolitical. As political tensions escalated on the eve of the Bosnian war, Horde Zla shifted its apolitical course and became one of the first organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina that openly endorsed and supported the return of the old, historical name for Bosnian Muslims – Bosniaks, as well as calling for Bosnian independence.

===Bosnian independence===

With the start of the Bosnian War many Horde zla members together with their counterparts from other ultras groups stood at the forefront of fronts to defend their city and homeland. A memorial plaque on the north side of the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium bears tribute to the hundreds of members of the group killed in the fight for Bosnian independence. As peace was restored to the country and competitive football once again resumed, Horde zla took back their place on the North stand of the country&#x27;s biggest stadium on the 10th anniversary of the firm&#x27;s founding. The group again made headlines when, during the 1998 Sarajevo derby against Željezničar, they invaded the pitch after members of the opposing firm, The Maniacs assaulted the FK Sarajevo goalkeeper Mirsad Dedić, resulting in a large on field skirmish that resulted in over thirty serious injuries.

===The new generation (2007–)===

By the mid 2000s a new generation of Ultras came up the ranks, unhappy with what they perceived as the group becoming a source of income for the older generation through petty theft, collaboration with an unpopular club management, drug dealing and exploitation of the Horde zla brand. Furthermore, differences existed in the way the two sides saw the future of the group. The younger generation namely wanted a more decentralized organization, while the older called for stronger centralization. By 2006 the new generation, organized through half a dozen subgroups, left the north stand in boycott of the &quot;agentry&quot;, as they called the leadership of the group, and moved to the west stand of the stadium, where they became known as Horde Zla Zapad (English: &quot;Hordes of Evil West&quot;). For a year and a half the two fractions supported their team separately, often going into battle across the city. By 2008 physical altercations and violence between the opposing camps turned the city into a battle ground, eventually leading to the younger generation taking control of the north stand. On 9 August 2007 Horde zla clashed with security personnel and police before a Champions League qualifying tie in Genk. In April 2010 Horde zla invaded the pitch after Sarajevo played a 1:1 draw against NK Široki Brijeg, and eventually went on to demolish large portions of the stadium including the VIP box and the benches in clashes with the police and security personnel. The incident resulted in over 40 minor and serious injuries. That same evening members of the group took part in large scale riots during a war veteran&#x27;s rally that was demanding more social benefits from the government. In July 2012, Horde Zla clashed with Levski Sofia supporters in the first leg of a UEFA Europa League match that was held in Sofia, Bulgaria. They had previously occupied a hotel in downtown Sofia which they ransacked and demolished, not allowing the police to enter by raising barricades. On 20 July 2013 Horde zla clashed with the fans of Albanian club FK Kukësi in Tirana before the start of a Europa League match. On 25 September 2013 Horde zla invaded the pitch during a game versus FK Borac, charging on the visiting fans situated on the South stand of the Asim Hase Ferhatović stadium. The police were forced to intervene and the fixture was subsequently abandoned. On 13 July 2015 Horde zla clashed with Lech Poznań hooligans for hours the night before a Champions League Qualifier in Vogošća, near Sarajevo. On 22 July 2015 Horde zla clashed with Sparta Prague hooligans in Prague, while on their way to Poznań for the reverse leg. On 21 March 2015 Horde zla clashed with police during a league tie fixture at the Vrapčići Stadium in Mostar, leading to numerous injuries. On 22 August 2015 Horde zla clashed with the special police and Čelik fans during a league tie in Zenica, which halted the game for over half an hour. On 9 March 2016 Horde zla clashed with police at the Tušanj Stadium in Tuzla during a Cup tie against Sloboda Tuzla. On 23 July 2016 Horde zla halted the Sarajevo derby on the Grbavica Stadium for nearly an hour, after clashing with police and ripping off seats and setting them alight.

=== Široki Brijeg riots ===
On 4 October 2009 Horde zla again made headlines during the infamous Široki Brijeg Football Riots which are considered the worst example of football violence in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The riots resulted in the death of Horde zla member Vedran Puljić from gunshot wounds, with over 40 other participants of the mayhem sustaining serious injuries, including four nonfatal gunshot wounds. The riots started with confrontations between members of Horde zla and the hometown Ultras, Škripari, which subsequently spilled out over the majority of the town. Horde zla burned cars, nearly blew up a gas station and demolished shops while Škripari and residents of Široki Brijeg stoned visiting fan&#x27;s buses and shot at them with firearms. Horde Zla also claim multiple counts of severe police brutality which led to the death of Horde zla member Vedran Puljić from police inflicted gunshot wounds. There are conflicting reports about who started the violence. Horde zla accused local residents and police of mistreatment on their way to the match, saying that the incident was planned by local politicians and that their buses were separated and parked too far from the stadium which left them open to stoning and attacks. They also claim that initially there were only 30 local policemen present, and they did nothing to prevent the violence. Local police and residents said Horde Zla fans were the first to attack. A local policeman, Oliver Knezović, accused of murdering Puljić, fled to Zagreb, Croatia from where he could not be extradited to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as there is no agreement on this issue between the two countries.

==USD Bosna==
Horde Zla and FK Sarajevo garner a close relationship with USD Bosna, or University Sport Society Bosna (). The most notable members of said society are KK Bosna Royal, that won the Euroleague Basketball title in 1979 and RK Bosna Sarajevo, that reached the 1/8 finals of the EHF Champions League in 2011.

The relationship traditionally stems from the fact that both sides share unique maroon and white club colours, which lead KK Bosna Royal to garner most of its fan base from FK Sarajevo in its rise to the top in the mid and late 1970s. Through time the two sides became colloquially interchangeable, as Horde zla equally followed both, forming a so-called &quot;Maroon Family&quot;. Even though RK Bosna did not represent a big player in Yugoslav handball, the club&#x27;s post-war ascent was thoroughly supported by Horde zla.

After an initiative proposed by Sarajevo fans, on 29 August 2013 FK Sarajevo and RK Bosna Sarajevo signed a cooperation agreement based on the principle of strengthening ties between the aforementioned &quot;family&quot; members. On 6 November 2013 the same was done between FK Sarajevo and KK Bosna Royal, by which the forty-year-old relationship was officialized.

<doc id="693057" wikidata="Q878702" url="?curid=693057" title="Tytila of East Anglia">
<text>Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today includes the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, identify him as an early member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, but he is not known to have definitely ruled as king and nothing of his life is known. He is listed in a number of genealogical lists.

A number of later mediaeval sources recorded that in about 616, Tytila was succeeded by his son Rædwald.

== The Wuffingas dynasty ==
The peoples known to us as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in southern and eastern Britain, and by the beginning of the seventh century, southern England was almost entirely under their control. Tytila was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of the East Angles that was named after his father Wuffa. The Wuffingas may have been descendants of an earlier Scandinavian dynasty. Both he and his father are semi-historical figures.

The Victorian ethnologist John Beddoe noted the similarity between the name &quot;Tytila&quot; and that of Totila, an Ostrogoth king.

Tytila is included in a number of different tallies. In the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, which was completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, Tytila is named as the father of Rædwald and the son of Wuffa: &quot; &#x27;Erat autem praefatus rex Reduald natu nobilis, quamlibet actu ignobilis, filius Tytili, cuius pater fuit Uuffa...&#x27; &quot;. The 9th century Welsh monk Nennius, in his &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, also lists Tytila, naming him as the father of Eni of East Anglia: &#x27;...Uffa, who begat Tytillus, who begat Eni...&#x27; whilst relating the origin of the kings of East Anglia. Tytila is included in an East Anglian royal tally that lists the ancestors of Ælfwald and that names many, but not all, of the early East Anglian kings. The tally, which forms part of the Anglian collection, comes from the 12th century &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;.

== Reign ==

Nothing is known of Tytila&#x27;s life or his rule, as no written records have survived from this period in East Anglian history. The mediaeval chronicler Roger of Wendover dated Tytila&#x27;s reign from 578, but his source of information is unknown and the accession date may have been a guess on the part of the chronicler. Tytila&#x27;s son and successor, Rædwald, the greatest of the Wuffingas monarchs, is the first East Anglian king who is more than a semi-historical figure, although much information about him, including the year of his death, is conjectural. The finds from the excavations of the two separate cemeteries at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk and at other sites in East Anglia point to close connections at this time between south-eastern Britain, the Frankish Rhinelands, the Eastern Mediterranean and of growing royal prestige and authority, reflected by the magnificent grave-goods discovered in the main burial-ship at Sutton Hoo. The grave goods at Sutton Hoo also point to close ties with Sweden. Names of family members also share similarity with names in Sweden at the same time. Plates on helmets found at the Valsgärde ship burial are so close to the ones from Sutton Hoo that it has been theorized that they were made by the same craftsman or a close associate or apprentice. The poem Beowulf from a few centuries later also lends validity to a close connection between the East Angles and their Southern Swedish cousins.

The date that Tytlila died is unknown, but he is thought to have been succeeded by his son Rædwald in about 616.

<doc id="693062" wikidata="Q623746" url="?curid=693062" title="Ska-P">
<text>Ska-P () is a Spanish ska punk band formed in 1994 in Vallecas, a district of Madrid, by a group of friends from Madrid, Navarre and Euskadi. 

The band can be categorized, politically, as an anti-establishment musical group, sometimes even considered anarcho-communist. Musically, despite their fun image, Ska-P has well-rehearsed and tight arrangements, and as of 2002, includes among its members a brass section.

At the end of 2004, they announced work on a new album. After voting four against two, in February 2005, the sudden and unexpected announcement was made that the band would take a break to allow the members to work on side projects, though some considered the band to have dissolved. Their farewell concert in September 2005 filled the 10,000-seat La Cubierta in Spain. The band&#x27;s worldwide farewell tour of 2005 ended in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in October of that year.

In October 2007 the band confirmed they were getting back together and in September 2008 released the single &quot;Crimen sollicitationis&quot;. This was followed in October by a new album, &quot;Lágrimas y gozos&quot; (&quot;tears and joy&quot;). The release of the album was followed by a brief tour. Ska-P returned to La Cubierta Stadium in December 2008 to perform their only concert in Spain of that tour. In 2010 and 2011, Ska-P held their first tour in Japan.

== Band name ==
The band name is a pun on the Spanish word for &quot;escape&quot; and ska p(unk). The name further takes advantage of the letter &quot;k&quot; common to ska, and since the early 1980s, also closely associated with the Madrid working-class district of Vallecas, as a symbol of working-class pride. Thus, Valle&quot;k&quot;as and many other occurrences of the &quot;k&quot; instead of the &quot;c&quot; or &quot;qu&quot; in Spanish words, reflecting also a feature of the Basque, which has neither the &quot;qu&quot; nor the &quot;c&quot;, replacing both with &quot;k&quot;.

== History ==

=== 1994: Beginning ===
Ska-P was formed by a group of friends in Vallecas, Madrid in 1994 as a ska band. The initial lineup was Pulpul (lead vocals and guitar), Toni Escobar (guitar and vocals), Julio (bass), Kogote (keyboard and vocals) and Pako (drums). That same year, they recorded their first CD, the nine-track &quot;Ska-P&quot;, with AZ Records. It did not sell many copies compared with later efforts, but it gave the group recognition, especially for the song &quot;Como un rayo&quot;, a song for the football team Rayo Vallecano, which became fairly popular in Vallecas. They played various concerts as support bands for Extremoduro and Platero y tu despite still having a small following.

=== 1995–1996: Rise to fame ===
Guitarist Toni left the band in 1995 (due to the impossibility of combining his work with the band&#x27;s schedule) and Joxemi took his place. Pipi, a friend of Pulpul, also joined the band. Previously, he had only entered onstage in costume in some concerts and had helped the group set up. From this point, he took the role of secondary vocalist while continuing to appear in costume during some songs.

In 1996, the group released their second album, &quot;El vals del obrero&quot;, on RCA Records, selling many records and becoming well known for the song &quot;Cannabis&quot;. They took part in the ninth Vallekas Rock Festival, an event which increased their reputation.

=== 1997–1999: &quot;Eurosis&quot; and the first world tour ===
After a tour of Spain and part of France, in 1997, they recorded their third album, &quot;Eurosis&quot;, again with RCA Records. They performed in Spain and France and also made their debut in Latin America, playing in Argentina and Mexico. Pako, drummer and founding member of Ska-P, left the band in the middle of the tour and was replaced by Luismi. The band also participated in Arezzo Wave, an Italian music festival.

=== 2000–2002: &quot;Planeta Eskoria&quot; and &quot;¡¡Que corra la voz!!&quot; ===
In 2000, they recorded &quot;Planeta Eskoria&quot;. Considered by some to be their best work, it helped to consolidate their sound and included songs with a more serious tone, although the album also included festive songs in the vein of previous discs and the lyrical content was no different from before. During this high point, they toured France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain. They were considered an international band.

Two years later, their fifth album, &quot;¡¡Que Corra La Voz!!&quot;, which Ska-P members have called their &quot;most complete&quot;, was released. It featured a mix of styles, with as many festive ska songs as more serious songs in the vein of &quot;Planeta Eskoria&quot;. The list of countries Ska-P toured included Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria and the other European countries previously mentioned. They also returned to Latin America, playing in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico. Furthermore, in these last tours, trumpet player Txikitín and trombonist Gari, both from the Spanish city of Bilbao, joined the band.

=== 2003–2004: &quot;Incontrolable&quot; tour ===
In 2004, &quot;Incontrolable&quot;, the last album before their &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;, was released. Besides having 16 songs, it included a DVD with 13 songs recorded in Switzerland and France. Video clips and images of the last tour were also included.

=== 2005–2007: Indefinite hiatus ===

After more than 12 years together, in February 2005, the band announced that they were going on an indefinite hiatus. They explained that they &quot;needed a rest&quot;, although Pipi claimed that the decision was made by Pulpul alone, and the rest of the group had to quit as they could not continue without him. In fact, there are rumors, based on the attitude of both sides, that there were internal squabbles between Joxemi, Pipi and Pulpul. Even so, the group declared that &quot;the possibility of a future return remains open&quot;. They also announced a farewell tour.

Their last concert in Spain was 24 September 2005 in La Cubierta de Leganés and their last show was in Argentina was on 12 October 2005. The group&#x27;s members decided to end their farewell tour there thanks to the treatment they had received there previously. All the revenue from this festival was donated to Argentine charities such as the mapuche communities (in memory of the pain inflicted on them by the Spanish during the conquest and formation of the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata) and almshouses serving food in Buenos Aires.

In 2006, six months after the hiatus begun, Pulpul wrote an entry on the official band website announcing that he was still composing and hoped that the lyrics would be included on a new Ska-P album. Some members of the group joined other groups during the hiatus, with Pipi, for example, founding a group similar to Ska-P called The Locos. Joxemi formed a group with a more punk style called No-Relax in 2006.

=== 2007–2014: End of first hiatus, second hiatus and new albums ===

On 12 October 2007, two years after the &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; began, a message from Pulpul appeared on the official Ska-P website referring to a possible Ska-P reunion in 2008. In the same message, the members of the group wrote positively of the reunion, except for Pipi, who initially said he would continue playing with his new group The Locos and would not return to Ska-P. In the details of the message, they said they would try to get together all the old members and possibly release an album in October 2008. In 2007, Alacrán Producciones opened a contract for a 2008 Ska-P tour. The group&#x27;s return was confirmed on the official page and a new album for October 2008, &quot;Lágrimas y gozos&quot;, was announced, as well as a mini-tour of Europe in Italy, France, and Spain, and of Latin America in Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina and Venezuela.

The album &quot;Lágrimas y gozos&quot; was released 7 October 2008, with the album &quot;99%&quot; following on 5 March 2013. In 2014, the group once again announced an indefinite hiatus.

On 5 October 2018, they released another album, &quot;Game Over&quot;.

<doc id="693063" wikidata="Q7961456" url="?curid=693063" title="Walden, Ontario">
<text>Walden (Canada 1996 Census population 10,292) was a town in the Canadian province of Ontario, which existed from 1973 to 2000. Created as part of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury when regional government was introduced, the town was dissolved when the city of Greater Sudbury was incorporated on January 1, 2001. The name Walden continues to be informally used to designate the area.

Walden now constitutes most of Ward 2 on Greater Sudbury City Council. Walden is part of the federal Sudbury electoral district, represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Viviane Lapointe of the Liberal Party of Canada, and the provincial constituency of Nickel Belt, represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by France Gélinas of the Ontario New Democratic Party.

In the Canada 2011 Census, the areas of Lively, Waters, Mikkola and Naughton were grouped for the first time as the &quot;population centre&quot; (or urban area) of Lively, with a population of 6,922 and a population density of 350.9/km2. No separate population statistics were published for the more rural western portion of Walden, which was counted only as part of the city&#x27;s overall census data; however, the individual census tracts corresponding to the former town of Walden had a total population of 10,664. For the Canada 2016 Census, the boundaries of the Lively population centre were revised to exclude Naughton, for a new population of 5,608 and an adjusted 2011 population of 5,584.

==History==

The town was created by amalgamating the township municipalities of Waters and Drury, Dennison &amp; Graham with the unincorporated geographic townships of Lorne, Louise and Dieppe and parts of the unincorporated townships of Hyman, Trill, Fairbank, Creighton, Snider and Eden. The name &quot;Walden&quot; was chosen as an acronym of &quot;Wa&quot;ters, &quot;L&quot;ively and &quot;Den&quot;ison. Other names were suggested, but the final selection process had narrowed the naming options to Walden or Makada, an Ojibwe name for the town&#x27;s Black Lake (&quot;makade&quot; in contemporary spelling).

Tom Davies, who later became chair of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, was the first mayor of Walden as a town. Later mayors included Charles White, Terry Kett, Alex Fex and Dick Johnstone. Following Davies&#x27; retirement as chair of the regional municipality in 1997, Sudbury&#x27;s city hall was renamed Tom Davies Square in his honour.

Prior to the municipal amalgamation, Walden was the largest town by land area in Canada.

==Communities==

===Lively===

The administrative and commercial centre of Walden, Lively was established in the 1950s as a company townsite for employees of INCO&#x27;s Creighton Mine facilities. It was named for an early settler, Charles Lively. Prior to the community&#x27;s establishment, a few family farms were located in the area. The most notable of these, the Anderson Farm, is now the Anderson Farm Museum, which showcases aspects of the history of Lively, Creighton, and Waters Township. Lively&#x27;s postal delivery and telephone exchange also include the Mikkola subdivision, located at the eastern terminus of Highway 17&#x27;s freeway segment, and the Waters area.

From the intersection of Municipal Roads 24 and 55, Lively refers to the area extending north along MR 24, Mikkola refers to the area extending eastward along MR 55 toward the Highway 17 interchange, and Waters refers to the area extending westward along MR 55 toward Naughton.

Lively was the first area hit by the Sudbury tornado on August 20, 1970.

Lively is also home to the Walden area&#x27;s branch of the Greater Sudbury Public Library.

===Little Creighton===
A small residential subdivision just north of Lively, long known as &quot;Dogpatch&quot;, officially rebranded itself as Little Creighton in 2015.

===Naughton===

Naughton was originally established as a point along the Canadian Pacific Railway Algoma Branch and was named McNaughtonville. In 1887, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company relocated its existing trading post from Whitefish Lake to the south, which had been established in 1824, to Naughton, so that it could be closer to the CPR line. The trading post closed in 1896, and during the 1920s and 1930s, many of the original buildings at the trading post site were demolished or burned down, though the store itself survived until at least the 1960s.

Naughton is the birthplace of Boston Bruins legend Art Ross, who was the son of Thomas B. Ross, the trading post&#x27;s postmaster in 1881. In 1947, Ross donated the NHL trophy bearing his name awarded to the player scoring the most points during the season. Ross was also inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945.

Naughton is also home to a number of historical plaques commemorating Salter&#x27;s Meridian, a survey line which resulted in the first known evidence of the Sudbury area&#x27;s massive mineral deposits, as well the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Whitefish Lake Trading Post. Naughton is also home to the Walden Cross Country Ski Club, of which sports the ParaNordic program (an organization that allows children with disabilities to cross-country ski in a familiar environment and race with others of their skill levels.) It was also home to the now-defunct &quot;Sparks AC&quot;, an affiliate of the Finnish-Canadian Amateur Sports Federation.

===Whitefish===


Whitefish is located approximately west of Lively, near the western terminus of the Highway 17 freeway route. Whitefish&#x27;s postal delivery and telephone exchange also include the community of Den-Lou, which is named for its location straddling the boundaries of the geographic townships of Dennison and Louise, and the Lake Panache area. Currently, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation is undergoing discussion in regards to extending the freeway through Den-Lou. As of 2016, Whitefish had a population of 219 people in 100 households.

Historically, Whitefish was a postal village along the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Sudbury-Soo line, which ran parallel to the south of the Algoma Eastern Railway (AER). Its station was situated along the line west of Naughton and east of Victoria Mines, where a junction and spur line connected it to the AER. In 1908, it had a recorded population of 150, and had two stores, two hotels, and telegraph and express offices. Today, the main heritage building in the community is the Penage Hotel, which after its past as a railway hotel, functioned in various capacities as a hair salon, a bar, apartments, and a convenience store.

The community was home to the Whitefish &quot;Kipinä AC&quot; (later &quot;Speed AC&quot;), a youth sports club which was an affiliate of the Finnish-Canadian Amateur Sports Federation.

===Beaver Lake===

The name &quot;Beaver Lake&quot; refers, generally, to the westernmost end of the former Town of Walden, along Highway 17 in the geographic township of Lorne, west of Whitefish. Like many communities in Northern Ontario, the modern history of Beaver Lake started with the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the area in the late 1880s. With the discovery of nickel deposits bringing jobs and settlers to the Sudbury area, Finnish immigrants in particular settled in the Beaver Lake area, south of the CPR line between Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, establishing farming homesteads centred around the lake and mostly producing milk as an export. The milk was often shipped by rail to &quot;Co-optas&quot; (in Copper Cliff) and later the Sudbury Producers and Consumers (P&amp;C) Co-Operative Dairy, both local dairy co-operatives started and mostly operated by Finns and supported by the Finnish dairy farmers in the region. Later, the milk was processed by the Copper Cliff Dairy.

The Beaver Lake farms were hurt financially by the Great Depression and the aging group of original settlers had mostly shut down their working farms by the 1950s, with many of the lots being subdivided and sold off. Nevertheless, many of their descendants continue to live in the area, which is heavily influenced by Finnish culture, though the single-room schoolhouse and general store were both casualties of this community crisis.

The community was also known for its &quot;Jehu AC&quot; youth athletics club, which was an affiliate of the Finnish-Canadian Amateur Sports Federation (FCASF). Founded in 1921, club members won victories while competing against athletes from Sudbury, Creighton, Timmins, and South Porcupine, as well as many other communities. &quot;Jehu AC&quot; was known for its dominance in cross-country skiing, a sport which Finnish settlers had brought with them to Canada and which was popularized by Finnish athletics clubs before its general acceptance as a Canadian sport. This was evident as late as 1961, when Beaver Lake athletes won five out of nine cross-country ski events at the Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) FCASF championship. As the population aged and youth left the community to seek economic opportunities, the club membership began to shrink. Its last event took place in 1969, after which it would sell its sports field to the Beaver Lake Sports and Cultural Club. Today, the club&#x27;s grounds mark the entry point for the Beaver Lake ski trails, which loop around and exit back at the club.

===Worthington===
====Mining disaster====
The Worthington Mine ore body was initially discovered in 1884 by Francis Charles Crean. In 1891, the first mine shaft was sunk, with a small community being incorporated nearby the following year which was named after the Canadian Pacific Railway construction superintendent James Worthington, notable as the person responsible for the naming of Sudbury after his wife&#x27;s hometown in England. At this time, it was operated by the Dominion Mineral Company with two shafts at depths of 35 and 95 feet (roughly 11 and 29 m). In 1894, however, mining operations at the site were suspended. Development began in 1907 to modernize the mine&#x27;s equipment, but was suspended in 1909. The troubled mine was acquired by the Mond Nickel Company in 1913 as Mond abandoned its previous operations at Victoria Mines. Mond quickly sank a third shaft to a depth of 200 feet (61 m), completed modernization of the mine&#x27;s equipment, and built several workers&#x27; cottages at the site to help house its 110-man workforce. The mine became operational and by 1917 had shipped 172,000 tons of ore, the majority of which was sold to the CPR to be used as track ballast rather than being sent to Mond&#x27;s Coniston smelter. In 1918, Mond continued its rapid development of the mine by deepening the third shaft to about 750 feet (229 m), developing existing mine shaft areas, and expanding its workforce to 220 men, while internally expanding the mine using a shrinkage stoping method. The following year, it upgraded the air compressor on the site with one originally located at the Frood Extension mine. Mond&#x27;s rapid development of the mine created a pillar of natural rock. As ore was extracted, workers underground observed cracks in this pillar, which Mond addressed with timbers to brace it. Undaunted, Mond continued its plans to deepen the shaft to 1000 feet (305 m) and continued to extract ore from the upper levels.

On October 3, 1927, abnormal rock shifts were observed and management made the decision to evacuate the 46 day shift workers underground and cancel the night shift. Additionally, the town of Worthington was also evacuated as a precaution. At 5:50 a.m. on October 4, a ground fault gave way, which caused the entire underground portion of the mine to collapse down to its fifth level (the 750-foot/229 m level), creating a crater which pulled into itself the mine&#x27;s power house, a worker&#x27;s home, and 500 feet (152 m) of CPR mainline track. With no injuries suffered, the disaster became an overnight sensation which attracted sightseers, and the crater left by the mine quickly filled with water and became an artificial lake. The mine was no longer deemed operational and was abandoned, though some buildings were still left standing including the headframe.

Nearby, the Totten Mine is currently under active operation after its own history of sustained closures and periods of operation, being originally operated from 1915 to 1917 by the Canadian Nickel Company, briefly revived in the 1950s-1960s with Inco exploration work and new shafts being sunk, but developments were abandoned in 1971 and the mine was allowed to flood in 1976. In 2007, Vale Limited began to rehabilitate the existing mine, which was reopened in 2014.

====Community====

Worthington was established as a community in 1892 and functioned as a basic settlement with 35 dwellings, a company store, a railway station and a post office. By 1910, there were several more establishments including a hotel and social hall. Its population gradually increased to a peak of 400-500 residents after the Mond company purchased the nearby mine and expanded its workforce. After the infamous mining disaster nearby, the original townsite was abandoned and many residents left; however, a new townsite was established in alignment with the highway to the north, and throughout the 1930s and 40s, it primarily functioned as a highway service outlet. In the 1950s, the community had a brief revival due to resumed mining activity at the Kidd-Copper and Totten mines, and the highway nearby was designated Ontario Highway 658 in 1968. However, the community was bypassed to the south by Ontario Highway 17 (forming a component of the Trans-Canada Highway), and Highway 658 was transferred by the province to the Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973 upon amalgamation and became Municipal Road 4, also known as Fairbank Lake Road. After this, the focal point of the settlement shifted south to align with Highway 17, bringing it closer to the community of Beaver Lake, and the longtime Worthington post office was relocated to Beaver Lake, though Worthington is still today a valid postal address which includes other communities like Beaver Lake, an indication of its historical status as the primary settlement east of Nairn Centre and west of Whitefish.

===Creighton Mine===
Creighton Mine, also known as simply Creighton, is located near the intersection of Municipal Road 24 and Highway 144. The community, established in 1900 as an INCO company town, took its name from the geographic township in which it is located, which was named by the province of Ontario in the 1880s for MPP David Creighton.

The town had a population of around 2,200 at its peak in the 1940s, although the population slowly declined after improvements in the area&#x27;s transportation networks made it easier for workers to live away from the company townsite.

In 1986, the town was closed down. and all of the town&#x27;s homes and businesses were torn down or moved to Lively. Some residents initially fought the plan, but were not successful in convincing the company to change its plans. Upgrading the town&#x27;s water, sewer, and road systems to contemporary standards would have cost the company over $10 million, a cost which the company deemed to be prohibitive. By 1989, most buildings had been demolished, and the town officially had no residents.

A few streets, sidewalks, and building foundations can still be found in the area. A monument was also placed in the community commemorating the people of Creighton.

The historic paymaster&#x27;s cabin from Creighton was moved to the Anderson Farm Museum where an annual reunion continues to bring former residents and family together to share their memories of their former community.

The mine is also the site of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.

===High Falls===

High Falls is a ghost town located near the junction of the Spanish River with Agnew Lake, at the westernmost boundary of the city.

The town was created in 1904, when a hydroelectric dam and power plant were built on the Spanish River. This power plant, owned and operated by Vale Limited, supplied electric power to many of the area&#x27;s mining towns, and is still operational today.

The town was closely connected to the nearby community of Turbine. However, in the 1960s, many families began to move away from the community for economic reasons, and by 1975 the community was virtually abandoned. Homes were demolished or relocated, and by the mid-1980s the power plant was the only remaining vestige of the community.

===Victoria Mines===

Victoria Mines is now a ghost town. It was established by the Anglo-German chemist and industrialist Ludwig Mond as a company town for his Mond Nickel Company for workers at the smelter that processed ore from his Mond Mine. A separate townsite of Mond was established at the mine itself, and the two communities are sometimes referred to as a single settlement known variously as Mond or Victoria Mines.

Operations at the mine began in 1899 and were in full swing by 1901. Meanwhile, a smelter had been built two miles to the south of the mine, on the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Sault Ste. Marie branch, which processed ore from the nearby mine site as well as from the Garson and Worthington mines. Production at the smelter initially employed 20 men, using steam power; by 1911, the workforce had grown to 200 men. In 1909, the smelter was connected to the Lorne Falls power plant and switched to electric power, leading to more than a doubling in ore capacity. Additional power arrived in 1916 from the Nairn Falls hydroelectric plant.

In these early years, the town, which was laid out to the north of the CPR line, grew rapidly, receiving a post office in 1900, a CPR passenger station in 1904 (enlarged in 1908), and an assortment of businesses and services, which included a butcher shop, barbershop, dry goods and grocery retailers, a bowling alley, a Roman Catholic church, a Presbyterian church, and public and separate schools. Housing at the town included an apartment building, three boarding houses, and fifty single dwellings, which housed anywhere from 300 to 600 people in its heyday. During this time, the CPR built a spur line along the 3 km distance to the mine site itself. Ethnic groups at Mond included Finns, Ukrainians, Poles, Italians, French, and British, and Victoria Mines had a small &quot;Italian town&quot;.

Starting in the early 1910s, Mond Nickel had begun to expand its operations around the Sudbury area, and the Garson mine&#x27;s output had outstripped the original Mond Mine&#x27;s production. Mond opened a new smelter in Coniston in 1913, which was closer to the other company-owned mines, as well as having a better connection to the CPR&#x27;s new Toronto-to-Sudbury line. In the same year, the Victoria Mines smelter was closed. Many buildings were dismantled and moved by rail to Coniston or Worthington (itself now another ghost town), including the Anglican and Presbyterian churches which today still stand in Coniston. The public school was closed in 1914 and children of the remaining inhabitants were forced to walk 4.2 kilometers to the Mond public school, which remained open as the mine there was still active. During this time, all of the smelter workers relocated to Coniston, leaving behind only a hundred or so residents.

The townsite continued to be inhabited by a number of people for decades, ironically surviving longer than its twin town of Mond, which became a ghost town when the mine was closed a decade later in 1923, with the last house being removed in 1936. During its lifetime, the mine produced almost 620,000 tons of ore. A few buildings survived on the site well into the 1950s, but by the 1980s there were only three structures remaining, which were two company-built houses and the separate school. As of 2017, only one structure remains standing, a two-storey company house.

In 2002, mineral rights in the area were acquired by FNX, which merged with Quadra in 2011 to form Quadra FNX Mining. Quadra FNX was in turn acquired by Polish conglomerate KGHM Polska Miedź in 2011, which inherited the claims. Construction was slated to begin on a new mine by 2015 with operations to begin in 2019, but KGHM slowed down its development at the site due to depressed metal prices. As of early 2019, the project was still at pre-environmental assessment stage.

Victoria Mines is the birthplace of Hockey Hall of Famer Hector &quot;Toe&quot; Blake, though he grew up largely in Coniston.

==Transportation==
Some of Walden&#x27;s various communities are served by GOVA&#x27;s 101 Lively bus, which departs Naughton Community Centre for the downtown Sudbury transit terminal approximately every 2 hours, though there is more frequent service on weekday mornings. Along the way, it stops throughout Lively, Copper Cliff, and the west end of Sudbury, before terminating at the South End transit hub. As of 2019, there is no local bus service to the communities further to the west, such as Whitefish and Beaver Lake; however, GOVA also operates an auxiliary taxi service which covers as far as Whitefish.

No intercity transit is available in the Walden area despite most of its communities being situated along the Trans-Canada Highway. The closest intercity transit to the area is in downtown Sudbury, or alternatively an Ontario Northland flag stop in Nairn Centre.

==Education==
Students in the English catholic stream attend St. James Catholic Elementary School and St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School. Those in the English public stream attend either Whitefish&#x27;s R.H. Murray Public School or Lively&#x27;s Walden Public School for elementary education, and Lively District Secondary School for middle school and high school education. Those in the French public stream attend Helene Gravel and Macdonald Cartier. Those in the French Roman Catholic stream attend St-Paul and Sacré Coeur.

==Media==
Walden was previously served by monthly newspapers, the &quot;Walden Observer&quot; and later &quot;Walden Today&quot;. Neither are currently in production.

Walden is otherwise served by citywide media, although its proximity to the North Shore region means that residents of Whitefish, Beaver Lake and Worthington also have access to several radio stations, including CJJM-FM in Espanola, CFRM-FM in Little Current and CKNR-FM in Elliot Lake, whose signals do not reach the main urban core of Sudbury, as well as Espanola-area rebroadcasters of Sudbury&#x27;s CBCS-FM and CBON-FM.

<text>The Red Pyramid, also called the North Pyramid, is the largest of the pyramids located at the Dahshur necropolis in Cairo, Egypt. Named for the rusty reddish hue of its red limestone stones, it is also the third largest Egyptian pyramid, after those of Khufu and Khafre at Giza. It is also believed to be Egypt&#x27;s first successful attempt at constructing a &quot;true&quot; smooth-sided pyramid. Local residents refer to the Red Pyramid as &quot;el-heram el-watwaat&quot;, meaning the Bat Pyramid.

The Red Pyramid was not always red. It used to be cased with white Tura limestone, but only a few of these stones now remain at the pyramid&#x27;s base, at the corner. During the Middle Ages much of the white Tura limestone was taken for buildings in Cairo, revealing the red limestone beneath.

==History==

The Red Pyramid was the third pyramid of four built by Old Kingdom Pharaoh Sneferu, and was built 2575–2563 BCE. The Red Pyramid is located approximately to the north of the Bent Pyramid. It is built at the same shallow 43-degree angle as the upper section of the Bent Pyramid, which gives it a noticeably squat appearance compared to other Egyptian pyramids of comparable scale. Construction is believed to have begun during the thirtieth year of Sneferu&#x27;s reign (c. 2590 BCE). Egyptologists disagree on the length of time it took to construct. Based on quarry marks found at various phases of construction, Rainer Stadelmann estimates the time of completion to be approximately 17 years while Rolf Krauss, based on this same graffiti, suggests a period of construction of 10–11 years, an estimate later supported by John Romer.

Archaeologists speculate its design may be an outcome of engineering crises experienced during the construction of Sneferu&#x27;s two earlier pyramids. The first of these being, the Pyramid at Meidum, collapsed in antiquity, while the second, the Bent Pyramid, had the angle of its inclination dramatically altered from 54 to 43 degrees part-way through the construction due to complications that accured during the three construction phases.

Some archaeologists now believe that the Meidum pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth-sided pyramid, and that it may have collapsed when construction of the Bent Pyramid was already well under way – and that the pyramid may by then have already begun to show alarming signs of instability itself, as evident by the presence of large timber beams supporting its inner chambers. The outcome of this was the change in inclination of the Bent Pyramid, and the commencement of the later Red Pyramid at an inclination known to be less susceptible to instability and therefore less susceptible to catastrophic collapse.

==Modern day==

The Red Pyramid is high, and wide. Fragments of a rare pyramidion, or capstone, for the Red Pyramid was uncovered and reconstructed, and is now on display at the Red Pyramid&#x27;s site at Dahshur. However, whether the fragments were actually ever part of a pyramidion is unclear, as the reconstruction&#x27;s angle of inclination differs from that of the pyramid for which it was apparently intended.

The Red Pyramid, along with the Bent Pyramid, was closed to tourists for many years because of a nearby army camp. It is now usually open for tourists and a somewhat intrusive ventilation system has been installed which pipes air down the entrance shaft to the interior chambers. Visitors climb steps cut in or built over the stones of the pyramid to an entrance high on the north side. A passage, in height and wide, slopes down at 27° for to a short horizontal passage leading into a chamber whose corbelled roof is high and rises in eleven steps. At the southern end of the chamber, but offset to the west, another short horizontal passage leads into the second chamber. This passage was probably closed at one time and the offset was a measure intended to confuse potential tomb robbers.

The second chamber is similar to the first and lies directly beneath the apex of the pyramid. High in the southern wall of the chamber is an entrance, now reached by a large wooden staircase built for the convenience of tourists. This gives onto a short horizontal passage that leads to the third and final chamber with a corbelled roof high. The first two chambers have their long axis aligned north-south, but this chamber&#x27;s long axis is aligned east-west. Unlike the first two chambers, which have fine smooth floors on the same level as the passages, the floor of the third chamber is very rough and sunk below the level of the access passage. It is believed that this is the work of tomb robbers searching for treasure in what is thought to have been the burial chamber of the pyramid.

<text>Valley East (Vallée-Est in French) is a district of the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.

First incorporated in 1973 as a separate town within the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, Valley East was so named because it comprised the eastern half of the Sudbury Basin. The largest of the six towns in the Regional Municipality, it was reincorporated as a city in 1997 due to continued population growth. On January 1, 2001, the city and the Regional Municipality were dissolved and amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury.

Before the amalgamation, Valley East was Northern Ontario&#x27;s sixth-largest city, ranking after Timmins and before Kenora. According to the Canadian census of 2001, the last one that recorded Valley East as a separate entity, the city had a population of 22,374.

In the Canada 2011 Census, Valley East&#x27;s main neighbourhoods were grouped as the &quot;population centre&quot; (or urban area) of Valley East, with a population of 20,676 and a population density of 368.9/km2, although the boundaries of the urban area do not correspond to those of the former municipality.

Valley East is now divided between Wards 5, 6 and 7 on Greater Sudbury City Council, and is represented by councillors Mike Parent, René Lapierre, and Natalie Labbée.

<text>Nickel Centre (1996 census population 13,017) was a town in Ontario, Canada, which existed from 1973 to 2000.

It was created as part of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. On January 1, 2001, the town and the Regional Municipality were dissolved and amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury. The town is now divided between Wards 7 and 9 on Greater Sudbury City Council, and is represented by councillors Mike Jakubo and Deb McIntosh.

In the 2011 Canadian census, the Garson-Falconbridge corridor within Nickel Centre was counted as part of the &quot;population centre&quot; (or urban area) of Sudbury, while the census tracts corresponding to the former boundaries of Nickel Centre had a population of 13,232. In the Canada 2016 Census, the boundaries of the Sudbury population centre were revised to retain Garson but exclude Falconbridge, while a new population centre was added for Coniston (population 1,814).

==Communities==

===Coniston===

Coniston was a part of the geographic Neelon Township, which was named after Sylvester Neelon. The first settlers in the Coniston area were the Butler family, who arrived in 1902. They were joined by five other families by 1904, who created their own farms. Common crops included hay, rye, and oats. The Canadian Northern Railway (a predecessor of the Canadian National Railway) arrived in 1905, with Coniston lying along its transcontinental line. It was joined in 1908 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which constructed a new direct line linking Sudbury and Toronto via Romford Junction. The population had risen to 20 families during this period and settlers requested the establishment of a local post office, which had to be named; the name Neelon was originally considered, but Dennis O&#x27;Brien, a local settler who became the first postmaster, decided on the name Coniston after it was suggested to him by T. Johnson, a railway construction superintendent who had been reading a novel set in the village of Coniston in the Lake District of England.

The Mond Nickel Company arrived in Coniston in 1913, relocating its smelter operations from the earlier settlement of Victoria Mines (located west of Sudbury), which swiftly became a ghost town. Coniston was chosen due to its more favourable rail connections and terrain. As part of the relocation, Mond purchased five family farms totalling , which &quot;brought an end to the agricultural orientation of the community.&quot; Coniston was re-established as a Mond company town, with many existing company houses being relocated from Victoria Mines, along with the provision of a modern planned town with a street grid, sidewalks, and a water distribution system.

Coniston was subsequently incorporated under the provisions of the Municipal Act by Ontario Municipal Board Order A4741 on January 1, 1934, and remained such until the establishment of regional government. Prior to its annexation into Nickel Centre, the town&#x27;s mayors were Edgar Taylor Austin (1934–46), Roy Snitch (1947–52), Walter Kilimnik (1953–57), William Evershed (1958-59), Maurice Beauchemin (1960–62) and Mike Solski (1963-72). Solski, the final mayor of Coniston as an independent town, won election to the mayoralty of the amalgamated town of Nickel Centre in 1972.

Notable residents of Coniston have included hockey players Neal Martin, Noel Price, Toe Blake, Jim Fox, Leo Lafrance, Andy Barbe and Randy Boyd as well as many other great hockey players. Coniston also includes the smaller neighbourhood of Austin, which may also be known as Old Coniston. This area borders Highway 17 and is home to a baseball field. The baseball field was abandoned and decommissioned prior to 2000 when Coniston became part of Greater Sudbury.

===Falconbridge===

The geographic township of Falconbridge was named in the 1880s for William Glenholm Falconbridge, a justice of the High Court of Ontario. The original settlement in the township was a small lumber camp.

A significant ore body was discovered in 1902 by Thomas Edison near what is now Falconbridge&#x27;s Centennial Park. The Edison Ore-Milling Company was unsuccessful in establishing a mining operation, and abandoned his original claim in 1903. The claim reverted to Crown land until the Longyear Drilling Company bought it in 1911. Longyear subsequently merged with other small mining companies in the area to form the basis of what would ultimately become Falconbridge Ltd., although actual mining operations in the community did not begin until 1928, when Thayer Lindsley purchased the company for $2,500,000 and finally sunk the Falconbridge deposit&#x27;s first mine shaft the following year.

Falconbridge Ltd. built the Edison Building in 1969 to serve as its head office. Falconbridge Ltd. was taken over by Swiss mining company Xstrata in 2006. In 2007, Xstrata donated the Edison Building to the city to serve as the new home of the municipal archives.

Falconbridge was incorporated as a town in 1957. The town&#x27;s first and only reeve, John Franklin, served until the creation of Nickel Centre in 1973.

A visual and radar UFO incident occurred in the community on November 11, 1975, later reported in a press release by NORAD. The object was tracked on radar from CFS Falconbridge and sighted in binoculars, and estimated to be a 100-ft. diameter sphere with craters. Seven OPP police officers also witnessed the UFO. Some explanations given for the sightings included Venus, clouds, and/or weather balloons.

===Garson===

The community is named after the geographic township of Garson, named by the Ontario Government in the 1880s for William Garson, who represented Lincoln in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1886 to 1890.

The area was first developed in 1888 as a logging camp, by the Holland and Emery Lumber Company of East Tawas, Michigan. In that year this firm constructed a narrow gauge logging railway from Wahnapitae, establishing its main operations at Headquarters Lake, near the Garson townsite. Logs from this area were taken to the Wanapitei River and driven to Lake Huron. Eventually this track was extended north into Capreol Township.

The Canadian Northern Railway was built through Garson in 1908.

Garson Mine, which is now owned by Vale Inco was first developed in 1911 by the Mond Nickel Company. The defunct Kirkwood Mine was also located in Garson.

===Skead===

Skead is located approximately 25 kilometres northeast of downtown Sudbury, and situated on south shore of Lake Wanapitei. Home to over 600 year round residents, Skead was settled about 1921 as a sawmill community, when the Spanish River Lumber Company relocated there from its original mill site, near the mouth of the Spanish River. It was named by the firm&#x27;s general manager W. J. Bell, in honour of his late father-in-law, Canadian Senator James Skead. Skead was a stop on the Canadian Northern Railway line from Capreol to North Bay, which later became the Canadian National Railway Alderdale Subdivision, but rail service declined in the mid-20th century and was eliminated altogether in 1996.

====Boland&#x27;s Bay====
Skead&#x27;s address and telephone service also includes the smaller neighbourhood of Boland&#x27;s Bay (), a dispersed rural community and unincorporated place, on the eponymous bay at the southwestern tip of Lake Wanapitei. The community was known as Bowlands Bay and the bay as Bowland Bay until 1975 when the present spellings were adopted. However, the old spelling continues on the local street Bowlands Bay Road. Boland&#x27;s Bay (spelled Bowlands Bay in older timetables) was a milepoint on the Canadian Northern Railway line from Capreol to North Bay, which later became the Canadian National Railway Alderdale Subdivision, but rail service declined in the mid-20th century and was eliminated altogether in 1996.

===Wahnapitae===

The community of Wahnapitae is located east of Sudbury along Highway 17. Established as a logging community, it was the first settlement in Nickel Centre. The community takes its name from the Wanapitei River, which flows through Wahnapitae, and whose name in turn comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;waanabidebiing&quot;, which means &quot;concave-tooth [shaped] water&quot; and describes the shape of Lake Wanapitei. The correct spelling of the community&#x27;s name should not be confused with the correct spelling for the water bodies. During early stages of the town&#x27;s development, the river was used by multiple companies to send harvest logs to Southern Ontario for processing. After mining became more viable in the Sudbury District, logging operations in Wahnapitae were stopped, leaving the town as a residential community.

==Ghost town==
===Happy Valley===
The ghost town of Happy Valley, originally known as Spruce Valley, was first inhabited in 1906 by workers from the nearby mine at Garson. Not wanting to live in the company town, the workers built Happy Valley as their own. In 1930, the Garson Mine shut down, and the workers were transferred to the mines at Falconbridge.

Due to temperature inversions, the smelter at Falconbridge created severe pollution problems in Happy Valley, as heavy sulphur emissions from the smelter would become trapped in the valley. Workers suspected that they were being poisoned by pollution, which were confirmed in the 1960s and 1970s as society grew more environmentally-conscious. The community reached a multi-year deal with Falconbridge that the smelter would not operate on days when a north wind was blowing. After pressure was put on the Ontario government to do something about the poisoning via pollution, they began the process of abandoning Happy Valley in cooperation with the Regional Municipality of Sudbury and Falconbridge. It was the first occurrence where the provincial government financed the relocation of a community due to air pollution. Most Happy Valley residents accepted compensation to leave their homes and moved away by the mid-1970s, although at least one resident refused to leave and remained in the area until the late-1980s. The ghost town is currently off limits to the general public and protected by a barbed-wire fence.

==Transportation==
The Greater Sudbury Airport, the city&#x27;s main airport, is located in Nickel Centre approximately halfway between Falconbridge and Skead, although its official mailing address is in Garson.

Highway 17, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway, passes through Coniston and Wahnapitae. Highway 17&#x27;s freeway segment in the Walden area is slated to be expanded through Nickel Centre toward Markstay, along the existing Southwest and Southeast Bypass route and thence on a new alignment past Coniston and Wahnapitae.

<doc id="693081" wikidata="Q3421337" url="?curid=693081" title="Rayside-Balfour">
<text>Rayside-Balfour (1996 census population 16,050) was a town in Ontario, Canada, which existed from 1973 to 2000. It is now part of the city of Greater Sudbury.

The town was created as part of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury and took its name from the townships of Rayside and Balfour, which fell within the boundaries of the new town; prior to the town&#x27;s creation in 1973, Rayside and Balfour were separately incorporated as township municipalities.

Although the Regional Municipality of Sudbury was a very important centre of Franco-Ontarian population and culture, Rayside-Balfour was the only town in the regional municipality which had a majority francophone population. It remains as such still today.

==History==
On January 1, 2001, the town and the Regional Municipality were dissolved and amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury. The Rayside-Balfour area is now divided between Wards 3 and 4 on Greater Sudbury City Council, and is represented by councillors Gerry Montpellier and Geoff McCausland.

In 2006, there was interest in the deamalgamation of the former town of Rayside-Balfour from the City of Greater Sudbury. However, as any referendum on the matter would require the consent of the provincial government, any such move is not likely to take place.

In the Canada 2011 Census, the entire main populated core of Rayside-Balfour was counted as part of the &quot;population centre&quot; (or urban area) of Sudbury, with no separate population statistics published for the Rayside-Balfour area alone. However, the four census tracts corresponding to the former Rayside-Balfour had a total population of 14,557. For the Canada 2016 Census, Chelmsford and Azilda were removed from the Sudbury population centre and each aggregated as their own new population centres, with Azilda having a population of 4,663 and Chelmsford having a population of 6,215. The latest population trend is increasing in Azilda, but relatively stable in Chelmsford.

==Communities==
===Azilda===

Azilda gets its name from Azilda Bélanger (née Brisebois), the first female pioneer of the area and wife of Joseph Bélanger, mayor of Rayside from 1899–1900 and again in 1905. She was well-known in the town, especially for her healing abilities. The town had originally applied for the name Ste-Azilda until it was realized that there was no saint with that name.

The community borders the shores of Whitewater Lake, except for its most western portion.

Municipal Road 35, linking Azilda to downtown Sudbury, has been increased from two lanes to four lanes, which has improved the commute for Azilda&#x27;s workers, who are mostly employed in the city&#x27;s urban core. In addition, it shortens the travel time for tourists hoping to visit Sudbury Downs, which is located in the outskirts of Azilda. There are plans to complete the widening of Municipal Road 35 between Azilda and Chelmsford, on which construction began in 2019 and is scheduled to be completed in 2020.

On September 12, 1906, Azilda was the site of a train wreck.

While the population is still growing, there are no industries other than basic agriculture (corn, potatoes, beans) and horticulture. Much of the workforce travels to Sudbury to work, often in the primary industries such as mining.

Azilda&#x27;s telephone and postal service also includes the smaller local neighbourhood of Bélangerville.

Azilda has its own flag that was revealed in 2021.

Its offices are in the Former École Secondaire Rayside building

===Chelmsford===

Founded in 1868, Chelmsford started out as an outpost on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Some say Chelmsford was named by a Canadian Pacific Railway engineer from the United Kingdom. As with many communities in Northern Ontario, logging and fur trapping were the first industries. Having depleted the lumber in the early 1900s, Chelmsford turned to mining and agriculture to support the town&#x27;s economy. Errington Mine and Nickel Offset mine were two of the largest mines in Chelmsford and both closed in the 1930s.

In 1909, Chelmsford was separately incorporated as a town. It retained this status until 1968, when it was reamalgamated with the township of Balfour.

Today, Chelmsford has no major industries and is mostly a residential community. Although there are still some farms producing mostly potatoes, small fruits and corn, it is mostly supported by the mining activities in the nearby communities of Onaping Falls and Copper Cliff.

Postal delivery and telephone service in Chelmsford also includes the smaller neighbourhoods of Boninville and Larchwood.

Chelmsford is host to an annual fiddle festival, Fiddle Works, in May.

Its offices are on Highway 144 beside Petro-Canada.

===Boninville===

Boninville is located on the border with Valley-East in the Rayside Township. The name was created from two prominent farming families in the area: Bonin and Rainville. The main intersection is at Montée Rouleau and Rue St-Laurent. The area is known for potato farming. The families are French-Canadian and worship at the Roman Catholic Church Notre-Dame-du-Très-Saint-Rosaire in Blezard Valley.

Its offices are between Val Caron and Chelmsford

==Languages==
The towns have different languages. However, Chelmsford has a stronger francophone population with 53% speaking French at home and the 47% remaining speaking English at home
and Azilda on the other hand has a slight anglophone population with 52% speaking and 48% French speaking.

==Economy==
*R.M. Bélanger Ltd. (1961), construction company

==Politics==
Rayside-Balfour had two mayors prior to the amalgamation of Greater Sudbury: Gilles Pelland (1972–1988) and Lionel Lalonde (1988–2000). As part of the city, it is divided between Ward 3 (Chelmsford and the former town of Onaping Falls) and Ward 4 (Azilda and the northwestern portion of the former city of Sudbury) on Greater Sudbury City Council, represented by city councillors Gerry Montpellier and Geoff McCausland since October 2018 respectively.

The Rayside-Balfour area is in the federal riding of Nickel Belt, represented in the Canadian House of Commons by Marc Serré of the Liberal Party of Canada, and in the provincial riding of Nickel Belt, represented by France Gélinas of the Ontario New Democratic Party. As tradition goes, the area itself generally votes NDP both provincially and federally.

==Transportation==

Chelmsford and Azilda are served by Greater Sudbury Transit&#x27;s 702 Azilda/Chelmsford bus, which departs approximately every 2 hours. Both communities are also connection points for Greater Sudbury Transit&#x27;s transcab service, which connects passengers along Municipal Road 15 to Blezard Valley at Azilda, and Dowling, Onaping, and Levack at Chelmsford respectively.

For intercity transit, both communities are flag stops for Via Rail&#x27;s Sudbury–White River route, as well as Ontario Northland&#x27;s coach service.

==Education==

Azilda Students: those in the English Catholic stream attend St Charles School in the neighbouring community of Chelmsford and Bishop Carter Alexander Catholic Secondary School in Hanmer for boys and Marymount Academy for girls in nearby Uptown Sudbury. Those in the English public stream attend Chelmsford Public School and Chelmsford Valley District Composite School. Both of these schools are in the neighbouring community of Chelmsford. Those in the French Catholic stream attend École Ste-Marie in Azilda and École secondaire catholique Champlain in the neighbouring community of Chelmsford or Collège Notre-Dame in Sudbury. Those in the French public stream attend Franco-Nord and École secondaire Macdonald-Cartier.

<doc id="693082" wikidata="Q2239210" url="?curid=693082" title="Sonic Spinball">
<text>Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball, also known as Sonic Spinball, is a 1993 pinball video game developed by Sega Technical Institute and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It is a spin-off of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who must stop Doctor Robotnik from enslaving the population in a giant pinball-like mechanism. The game is set in a series of pinball machine-like environments with Sonic acting as the pinball.

It was developed by the American staff of Sega Technical Institute, as the Japanese staff was occupied with developing &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;. When Sega management realized that &quot;Sonic 3&quot; would not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday shopping season, they commissioned another &quot;Sonic&quot; game. After a hasty nine-month development, &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; was released for the Sega Genesis in November 1993, with ports for the Game Gear and Master System releasing in 1994.

&quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; received mixed reviews, with critics praising the novelty and graphics but criticizing the controls. A second pinball game, &quot;Sonic Pinball Party&quot;, was released in 2003, and a Sonic Spinball spinning rollercoaster opened in Alton Towers theme park, in 2010. &quot;Spinball&quot; has been ported to various consoles and included in Sega compilations.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; is a pinball game in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog, who acts as the pinball. The majority of the game takes place within the &quot;Pinball Defense System&quot;, which resembles a series of large pinball machines. The game comprises four levels, each containing numerous flippers that can be used to aim Sonic&#x27;s trajectory and launch him through the level. Sonic can be maneuvered while airborne with input from the directional pad, which can be used for better positioning following an impact with a bumper or target or when Sonic is descending toward the drain, bumpers or flippers.

The goal of each level is to collect all the Chaos Emeralds and subsequently defeat the newly accessible boss located at the top of the level. Some Chaos Emeralds are blocked off by obstacles that require Sonic to hit certain switches or bumpers in order to create a clear path. The boss at the top of each level requires a specific strategy to defeat. A &quot;status strip&quot; at the top of the screen provides hints for defeating bosses, as well as encouraging messages when the player makes progress. The strip also tells the player how many Chaos Emeralds are left to collect in a level. Following the defeat of an boss enemy, a bonus round is initiated. These rounds are shown as Sonic playing a regular pinball machine. The player is given three balls to shoot around the board, the object being to accumulate points by hitting as many bumpers and targets as possible. At any point in the bonus round, the player may trigger a tilt shake that rattles the table and affects the ball&#x27;s trajectory. If the tilt shake is used too often, however, all flippers will lock out, leaving the ball to fall down the drain. When the goal of the bonus round is fulfilled, or if all three balls fall through the flippers, the bonus round will end, and the next level will begin. When all the game&#x27;s Chaos Emeralds are collected and all four boss enemies are defeated, the player wins.

Sonic starts the game with three lives. A life is lost when Sonic falls through a drain. An extra life can be earned by accumulating 20,000,000 points, which can be accumulated by hitting bumpers, navigating through loops, collecting rings and destroying enemy characters.

==Plot==
The evil scientist Doctor Robotnik has built a fortress on top of a volcano to transform the animals of planet Mobius into robot slaves. The volcano&#x27;s magma fuels the fortress and the pinball machine-like defense systems. The volcano is kept in stable condition with Chaos Emeralds. Sonic the Hedgehog and his friend Tails mount an aerial assault on the fortress. Sonic is knocked into the waters that surround the volcano, but surfaces in the caves below the fortress. He infiltrates the defenses, absconds with the Chaos Emeralds, and frees the animals. Without the Chaos Emeralds, an eruption begins to destroy the fortress. Sonic destroys Robotnik&#x27;s escape ship. Tails rescues Sonic, while Robotnik falls into the volcano, which sinks into the ocean and explodes.

==Development==

&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; boosted sales of the Sega Genesis in the 1992 holiday shopping season. When Sega of America&#x27;s management realized that &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; would not be ready until next year, they commissioned another game that could be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season. &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; was developed by mostly American staff from Sega Technical Institute while the Japanese staff were producing &quot;Sonic 3&quot;.

Sega&#x27;s research suggested that the Casino Night Zone was one of the most popular levels in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;. This provided designer Peter Morawiec with a direction for the new game. Morawiec drew inspiration from the 1992 Amiga game &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; to combine pinball mechanics with the gameplay of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Morawiec and three colleagues designed basic animations depicting Sonic as a pinball. The animations were demonstrated to Sega&#x27;s senior management, who approved the project.

The game would have to be completed in under a year to be ready in time for the 1993 holiday season. Morawiec considered this a &quot;tight&quot; schedule for a game that would capitalize on the series&#x27; popularity in North America. To speed up production, Sega sent veteran staff from Japan to assist, including regular &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; artist Katsuhiko Sato. Despite the transfer of these staff, the game was still not predicted to be complete in time. As a result, Sega Technical Institute staff changed the programming language from assembly to C, an unusual choice for Genesis games at the time. Morawiec said the choice caused frame rate and optimization problems, but greatly accelerated development. A large part of the game&#x27;s development happen in June and August 1993, the project evolved from a roughly playable build to a completed game.

Immediately before the game was due to ship, the team was informed that Sega did not own the rights to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; theme tune. Morawiec recalled uproar among the team after Hirokazu Yasuhara, the lead designer on Sonic Team, explained that the tune was owned by the Japanese band Dreams Come True, whose member Masato Nakamura composed the soundtrack for the first two &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Morawiec tasked lead composer Howard Drossin to write a new theme within two hours.

===Release===
Morawiec believe the game would face &quot;acceptance challenges&quot; from both fans and the gaming media, as it strayed away from the traditional platforming genre. After returning to the United States from Europe, Morawiec was surprised to find that the game had sold well, and was pleased that it benefited from the franchise&#x27;s popularity. Nonetheless, he regretted that the team had lacked time to &quot;polish&quot; the game.

After the Game Gear game &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; received poor reviews in Japan, Sega released an 8-bit port of &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; for the Game Gear in its place worldwide in late 1994. It was also released for the Master System in Brazil and Europe in 1995. The 8-bit version is mostly identical to the Genesis game, with downgraded visuals and different, more platforming-oriented bonus stages. The Master System version was released near the end of the console&#x27;s lifetime and did not sell well, and became a valuable collector&#x27;s item.

&quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; has been rereleased on 11 different platforms. The Genesis version of the game has been rereleased on the &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; compilation for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and multiple iterations of the &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot; series of compilations, including a port to Game Boy Advance. The Game Gear version appears as an unlockable game in &quot;Sonic Adventure DX: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; for the GameCube and Windows, as well as &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. The game was intended to be included in the &quot;Sonic Classic Collection&quot; for the Nintendo DS, but was cut for unknown reasons. The Genesis version was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console on March 12, 2007, in North America and April 5, 2007, in Europe. An emulated form of the game was also made available for iOS devices via Apple&#x27;s App Store in 2010, but was later removed along with other Sega games in 2015. It was released on Steam in 2010 and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2022.

==Reception==
The Genesis version received generally positive reviews upon release. Laurie Yates of &quot;Electronic Games&quot; gave it a highly positive review, with scores of 90% for graphics and sound, and 95% for playability and replayability. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a positive review, calling it &quot;a fun, fast, and frenetic&quot; pinball game.

The visuals were generally well received. Ed Semrad of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; thought that the game being set inside a pinball machine was a novel idea, and also labelled the game&#x27;s visuals, music, and sound effects as &quot;top-notch&quot;. Al Manuel of the same publication opined that the graphics were not as &quot;sharp&quot; as other &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; titles, and also thought the sound was unimpressive.

Bob Strauss of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the game initially boasted a terrific concept, but had an ultimately flawed execution, saying that Sonic, acting as a pinball, often moved like a &quot;leaden marble&quot;. Rich Leadbetter from &quot;Mean Machines&quot; also expressed concern over the game&#x27;s lack of replay value, saying that despite its addictive gameplay, the four levels were not enough, especially given the price.

Andromeda of &quot;GamePro&quot;, in a mixed review of the Game Gear version, criticized the control configuration and felt that the game was a mediocre example of a pinball game, but admitted that it had a similar feel to previous &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; titles.

===Retrospective===
Retrospectively, &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; received mixed reviews, holding a score of 61% at the video game review aggregator GameRankings.

In a retrospective review, Lucas Thomas from &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the game&#x27;s graphics matched those of later &quot;Sonic&quot; games on the Genesis, and considered &quot;Spinball&quot; minigames to be &quot;visually distinct and well-done.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; thought the graphics were &quot;generally good&quot;, but indicated that there were other visually superior games for the Genesis. In similar vein, William Avery of &quot;GameSpot&quot; noticed that the game contained some slowdown. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Dan Whitehead criticized the game&#x27;s sluggish frame rate and slowdown that occurred when &quot;things threaten to get hectic&quot; in-game, noting that it suffered from &quot;the old Mega Drive problem&quot;.

Various aspects of the gameplay garnered a mixed reception from critics, though the game&#x27;s control scheme received the most criticism. Jeuxvideo.com&#x27;s reviewer enjoyed how Sonic himself acted as a pinball, but noticed that the controls were less precise and responsive when compared to other platformers. Dan Whitehead asserted that the game&#x27;s controls were &quot;muddled by the half-and-half approach&quot;, and criticized its &quot;clunky&quot; game engine, saying that the game&#x27;s control scheme ruined the pinball environments. Thomas stated, &quot;There are aspects of the control that could have been tighter, and its difficulty level may be a bit too extreme for new players.&quot; Damien McFarren from &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said that the game comes across as both a poor platformer and a poor pinball game due to its unconvincing ball physics and frustrating platform elements.

==Legacy==
A second pinball game in the series, &quot;Sonic Pinball Party&quot;, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 to generally favorable reviews.

In 2010, a spinning rollercoaster, Sonic Spinball, opened in the Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire. Although the rollercoaster was not originally designed with a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; theme, the ride became part of a sponsorship deal between Sega and Alton Towers. A &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;-themed hotel room was later made available at Alton Towers Hotel, which featured various playable &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games, as well as wallpaper based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I&quot;.

<doc id="693084" wikidata="Q7091701" url="?curid=693084" title="Onaping Falls">
<text>Onaping Falls (1996 census population 5,277) was a town in the Canadian province of Ontario, which existed from 1973 to 2000. It was created as part of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, and took its name from the waterfalls (High Falls) on the Onaping River.

On January 1, 2001, the town and the Regional Municipality were dissolved and amalgamated into the city of Greater Sudbury. The town is now part of Ward 3 on Greater Sudbury City Council.

In the Canada 2011 Census, the main communities in Onaping Falls were listed for the first time as two of six distinct &quot;population centres&quot; (or urban areas) in Greater Sudbury: Dowling (population 1,690, density 475.0 km2) and Onaping-Levack (population 2,042, density 251.3 km2).

==Communities==

Onaping Falls is an amalgamation of three local communities: Dowling, Onaping, and Levack. Dowling is located 11 km from Onaping along Highway 144, while Levack is located north of the highway along Municipal Road 8. The smaller subdivisions of Levack Station and Phelans are also located along Highway 144 between Dowling and Onaping.

The area is known for its recreational abundance; fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, cross-country and downhill skiing and most other recreational sports are common activities of the residents.

It has become famous for High Falls, where the Onaping River drops 55 metres in a single plunge. The town is at the point where the Canadian Shield meets the Sudbury Nickel Irruptive, caused by a meteorite strike two billion years ago. There is a lookout off Highway 144 called the A. Y. Jackson Lookout, for the famous Group of Seven artist who memorialized the view on his canvas.

The town is also home to Windy Lake Provincial Park.

==History==
Prior to the early 1970s, Levack and Onaping were company towns with no direct municipal government. Dowling was part of Dowling Township, which was already incorporated as a municipality.

With the advent of regional government in 1973, the town of Onaping Falls became a part of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, which also included the towns of Rayside-Balfour, Nickel Centre, Walden, Valley East and Capreol. The name &quot;Onaping Falls&quot; was chosen electorally between three contentious names: &quot;Mountainvale&quot; submitted by Levack resident Mary Carol McLellan, &quot;Onaping Falls&quot;, submitted by Onaping resident Ted Cunningham and &quot;Dowling&quot;, submitted by Dowling council. Mr. Cunningham received $25 for submitting the chosen name.

On November 9, 1973, Onaping Falls was the site of a truck - train collision which caused more than a 1,000 gallon spill at the New Cobden Road crossing off Highway 144 about 2 miles northwest of Dowling. Traces of PCB&#x27;s were found in the water table four years after the crash. 

The first mayor of Onaping Falls was Jim Coady, for whom the ice arena in Levack is named. Other mayors of Onaping Falls between 1973 and absorption into the City of Greater Sudbury were Bob Parker, Shirley Mirka and Jean Guy &quot;Chummy&quot; Quesnel.

==Politics==
Onaping Falls is currently part of Ward 3 on Greater Sudbury City Council, along with much of the former town of Rayside-Balfour. A Community Solutions team was established in April 2006 to deal with challenges to the amalgamation of the former towns into one City of Greater Sudbury. The Community Solutions Team was made up with representatives from across the new city (Jack Oatway, Marc Tasse, Martha Cunningham Closs, Keir Kitchen, Barry Brett, France Belanger-Houle, Gisele Chretien) and chaired by Floyd Laughren. The final report called the Constellation City listed many improvements to Greater Sudbury&#x27;s municipal governance The committee visited and spoke to citizens in several corners of the city and all former towns. The report completed in 2007, recommended the former Onaping Falls be reconstituted as its own ward on city council, although this has not occurred to date.

==Notable people==
Notable people from the Onaping Falls area include Olympian Joe Derochie (Canoe, 1960 Rome), National Hockey League players Dave Taylor (Los Angeles Kings), Dave Hannan (Pittsburgh Penguins) and Troy Mallette (Ottawa Senators), Olympic cyclist Eric Wohlberg, Paralympian (rowing) Steven Daniel and author Mark Leslie (Lefebvre). Recording artist and singer/songwriter Kevin Closs has made his home in Onaping Falls since 1990.

<text>The Larch family of formal specification languages are intended for the precise specification of computing systems. They allow the clean specification of computer programs and the formulation of proofs about program behavior.

The Larch family was developed primarily in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, involving researchers at Xerox PARC, DEC Systems Research Center (DEC/SRC), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and other places. Unlike the Z notation, the Larch family has one language for algebraic specification of abstract data types (the &quot;Larch Shared Language&quot; (LSL)), and a separate &quot;interface language&quot; tailored to each language in which programs are to be written, such as C, Modula-3, Smalltalk, etc. The Larch project also developed tools to support the use of formal specifications, including the Larch Prover (LP).

<doc id="693100" wikidata="Q1351888" url="?curid=693100" title="Hussain al-Shahristani">
<text>Hussain Ibrahim Saleh al-Shahristani (born 1942) is an Iraqi politician who served in different cabinet posts, including as Iraq&#x27;s Minister of Higher Education.

==Early life and education==
Al-Shahristani was born in 1942 in Karbala, Iraq. He hails from the al-Shahristani family. In addition to his native Arabic he has strong command of English and Persian as second languages. Shahristani showed an exceptional aptitude for science in Secondary School. 

He earned a BSc in chemical engineering from Imperial College London in 1965, and an MSc from the University of Toronto in 1967, from where he also received a PhD in chemical engineering in 1970. He specialised in the design and building of nuclear reactors. Part of his education was also in Russia.

==Career==
He was tipped to be the Iraqi Prime Minister during the 2004 discussions, a position which he refused to take it and stated &quot;I have always concentrated on serving the people and providing them with their basic needs, rather than party politics.&quot;

A senior member of the State of Law alliance, he was previously the deputy speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly under the Iraqi Transitional Government and was considered for the post of prime minister in both the current government and the interim government.

He was appointed oil minister in May 2006 after the withdrawal of the Islamic Virtue Party Minister, which was also a Shia from the government coalition. By August, however, he was under pressure as there was a fuel crisis.

In December 2012 he was named the head of the committee responsible for receiving and addressing the demands of the demonstrators. He has made some significant achievements in period of December 2012 to February 2013.

From 2006 to 2010, Shahristani was Iraq&#x27;s minister of oil, and he served as acting minister of electricity in 2010.

Before his arrest and imprisonment Shahristani served as Chief Scientific Advisor to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission. Prior to that, he was a lecturer at Mosul University (1973), an assistant professor at Baghdad University (1974), Chief of Baghdad University&#x27;s Radioisotope Production Department from 1975 to 1977, and Chief of the Nuclear Chemistry Department from 1977 to 1979.

He is recognised as the architect of Iraq&#x27;s oil future and during his time Iraq oil output reached a 20-Year high.

==Imprisonment==

Former government officials, including Khidir Hamza his successor, have claimed Hussain al-Shahristani was imprisoned for his refusal to cooperate with Saddam&#x27;s WMD program and his intentions to build nuclear weapons. He was imprisoned personally by Saddam Hussein and was threatened directly by him too. &quot;While imprisoned and tortured at Abu Ghraib prison for 11 years under Saddam Hussein he refused to help build a nuclear weapon for the country.&quot;

He was later sentenced to death in an effort to terrorize him but the sentence was reduced to lifetime imprisonment as the regime always hoped it could benefit from his skills and expertise one day—a false hope which never materialized for Saddam&#x27;s regime. He was put in a solitary confinement prison cell for 8 years and was not allowed to make any communication with his family or the outside world during that period.

In his memoir, &quot;Escaping to Freedom&quot;, he mentions that &quot;the sound of a defective neon light was the highlight of his time during that period since silence was all he could listen to&quot;. He could not have a conversation even with his prison guards and food was passed to him through the gap under the prison cell&#x27;s door. He escaped from Abu Ghraib during the 1991 Gulf War and went to Iran, where he left for UK. He obtained his freedom in an extremely daring &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; style escape plan which was conceived, orchestrated and implemented by him. He went on to set up humanitarian aid organisations for the millions of Iraqi refugees during the Saddam era.

Having spent more than a decade (1979–1991) as a political prisoner in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison under the regime of Saddam, he escaped during an allied bombing raid on Baghdad during the First Gulf War. H.E. al-Shahristani fled to Iran where he served as head of the Gulf War Victims Organization from 1991 to 1995. He later continued his support for the victims of Saddams&#x27;s regime and the Gulf War as head of the Iraqi Political Prisoners Union (2003) and as Chief of the Iraqi Refugees Relief Committee (1998–2003).

==Other positions==
Shahristani is a visiting professor at the University of Surrey United Kingdom.

In 2004, he taught as a professor at Baghdad University, and from 2002 to 2004 he was concurrently a visiting professor at Surrey University in the United Kingdom. In 2003 he was head of the Iraqi National Academy of Sciences, and prior to his role there, from 1998 to 2002 was an advisor to the International Technical Research Centre, London, United Kingdom.

==Awards==
Shahristani was awarded Roosevelt Freedom from Fear Award 2012. In a Prof. al-Shahristani was presented the award by Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the International Energy Agency IEA.

In his speech during the award ceremony he said &quot;I confronted my fear in December 1979 when I had to make a choice: either to work on Saddam’s nuclear weapon program, or pay a price. The choice was simple, and the price turned out to be 11 years and 3 months in prison.&quot;

==Conversation with Saddam&#x27;s half-brother==
After seven months in jail, Shahristani was taken in front of Saddam&#x27;s half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who offered to free him if he would work on Iraq&#x27;s secret nuclear weapons programme. &quot;Anybody who refuses to serve his country does not deserve to be alive,&quot; Shahristani quoted Tikriti as telling him.

&quot;I agree with you that the person must serve his country but what you are asking me is not a service to the country,&quot; Shahristani replied, he said in his book &quot;Escaping to Freedom&quot; (1999). He was eventually sentenced to 20 years and spent 11 in prison, some in solitary confinement.

==His reaction – Saddam&#x27;s Trial==
&quot;This is the day that the Iraqis have been waiting for. There are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of families who have lost their dear ones. They have been waiting for justice to be executed, and I think that Iraqis have received the news that they&#x27;ve been waiting for too many years.&quot;

==2014 Prime Minister To-Be==
He has been tipped by analysts close to decision makers in Iraq as a serious contender for the PM job. On 11 July 2014 he assumed the role of acting foreign minister in addition to his deputy prime ministership, after Kurdish politicians including former Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari withdrew from the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

<text>Pactolus (), also called Chrysorrhoas (Χρυσορρόας), the modern Sart Çayı , is a river near the Aegean coast of Turkey. The river rises from Mount Tmolus, flows through the ruins of the ancient city of Sardis, and empties into the Gediz River, the ancient Hermus. 
The Pactolus once contained electrum that was the basis of the economy of the ancient state of Lydia, which used the naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver to mint the first coins under Alyattes of Lydia.

==Name==
Pseudo-Plutarch in the De fluviis write that the river was initially called Chrysorrhoas (Χρυσορρόας ) because according to the legend, Chrysorrhoas (the son of Apollo) threw himself into the river.

Later it was called Pactolus, from Pactolus, the son of Leucothea, who during a festival of Aphrodite failed to recognize his own sister, Demodice, and ravished her. Upon realizing what he had done, overwhelmed with grief, he threw himself into the river. Because of this the name of the river changed from Chrysorrhoas to Pactolus.

==Legend==
As a river-god, Pactolus was said to be the brother of another river Hydaspes, and thus, offspring of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. He was the father of Euryanassa, one of the possible mothers of Tantalus’ children.

The only myth where Pactolus was an active participant is recounted in Nonnus’ &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; detailing the young god, Dionysus, in his Indian campaign. According to legend, King Midas divested himself of the golden touch by washing himself in the river. The historian Herodotus claimed that the gold contained in the sediments carried by the river was the source of the wealth of King Croesus, son of Alyattes.

In Sophocles&#x27; Philoctetes, the chorus recognizes Gaia as ruler of the &quot;golden stream Pactolus.&quot;

==Propertius 1.6==
The river is mentioned in Sextus Propertius&#x27; Elegy 1.6.

&quot;at tu seu mollis qua tendit Ionia, seu qua
Lydia Pactoli tingit arata liquor...&quot;

(&quot;But wherever either soft Ionia extends, or wherever the water of the Pactulus stains the Lydian fields...&quot;)

<doc id="693120" wikidata="Q460679" url="?curid=693120" title="Maneki-neko">
<text>The maneki-neko (招き猫, ) is a common Japanese figurine which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. In modern times, they are usually made of ceramic or plastic. The figurine depicts a cat, traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail, with a paw raised in a beckoning gesture. The figurines are often displayed in shops, restaurants, pachinko parlors, dry cleaners, laundromats, bars, casinos, hotels, nightclubs, and other businesses, generally near the entrance, as well as households. Some &quot;maneki-neko&quot; are equipped with a mechanical paw that slowly moves back and forth.

&quot;Maneki-neko&quot; come in different colors and styles and vary in degrees of detail. Common colors are white, black, red, and gold. In addition to statues, &quot;maneki-neko&quot; can be found in the form of keychains, piggy banks, air fresheners, pots, and numerous other media. &quot;Maneki-neko&quot; are sometimes referred to simply as &quot;lucky cats&quot; or &quot;calling cats&quot;.

==Common features==

&quot;Maneki-neko&quot; are traditionally depicted seated, holding a koban coin, with one paw raised in a beckoning gesture. To some Westerners (Italians, Spaniards and Greeks are notable exceptions) it may seem as if the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; is waving rather than beckoning. This is due to the difference in gestures and body language recognized by some Westerners and the Japanese. The Japanese beckoning gesture is made by holding up the hand, palm down, and repeatedly folding the fingers down and back, thus the cat&#x27;s appearance. Some &quot;maneki-neko&quot; made specifically for some Western markets will have the cat&#x27;s paw facing upwards, in a beckoning gesture that is more familiar to most Westerners.

&quot;Maneki-neko&quot; can be found with either the right or left paw raised (and sometimes both). The significance of the right and left raised paw differs with time and place. A statue with the left paw raised is to get more customers, while the right paw raised is to get more money. Hence it is also said that the one with left paw is for business and the right is for home.

Battery- and solar-powered &quot;maneki-neko&quot; are a modern iteration. Those sources power a simple circuit that regulates a current going through a coil, whose electromagnetic field subsequently &quot;pushes&quot; a magnet mounted to the end of the waving arm.

===Composition===

Antique examples of &quot;maneki-neko&quot; may be made of carved wood, stone and metal, handmade porcelain or cast iron.

===Colors===
Originally, &quot;maneki-neko&quot; were white, but over the years with the combination of Feng Shui, different color variations were born. The original white color is to get good luck and overall good fortune, while black is to ward off evil, red is for good health, yellow or gold is for wealth, and pink is for romance.

==History==
It is commonly believed that &quot;maneki-neko&quot; originated in Tokyo (then named Edo) or, sometimes, Kyoto. It is a common theory that &quot;maneki-neko&quot; as figurines originated from Imado ware sold in Asakusa during the Edo period (1603–1868). During the Tenshō era (1573–1592) of the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573–1592), clay suitable for pottery was discovered in Imado in Asakusa, and local people began to make Imado ware. In the Edo period, potters from the Mikawa Province moved to Imado in Asakusa and further developed Imado ware, and in the Genroku era (1688–1704), Imado dolls were made, which is thought to have given rise to &quot;maneki-neko&quot;. The earliest known record of &quot;maneki-neko&quot; as figurines is the &quot;marushime-neko&quot;, a variation of &quot;maneki-neko&quot; made of Imado ware in the late Edo period.

One of the earliest records of &quot;maneki-neko&quot; appear in the Bukō nenpyō&#x27;s (a chronology of Edo) entry dated 1852. Utagawa Hiroshige&#x27;s ukiyo-e &quot;Joruri-machi Hanka no zu,&quot; painted also in 1852, depicts the &quot;marushime-neko&quot;, a variation of &quot;maneki-neko&quot;, being sold at Sensō-ji Temple, Tokyo. In 1876, during the Meiji era, it was mentioned in a newspaper article, and there is evidence that kimono-clad &quot;maneki-neko&quot; were distributed at a shrine in Osaka during this time. A 1902 advertisement for &quot;maneki-neko&quot; indicates that by the turn of the century they were popular.

There are various folklore in Japan about the origin of &quot;maneki-neko&quot;. Several Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines that appear in folklore, such as Gōtoku-ji, and , are known as the birthplaces of the &quot;maneki-neko&quot;.
The most famous folklore concerns Ii Naotaka during the Kan&#x27;ei era (1622–1624) of the Edo period. On their way back from the falconry, Naotaka&#x27;s party stopped at Gōtoku-ji Temple to rest after being beckoned by a cat at the temple gate. A violent thunderstorm soon followed, and they marvelled at the cat&#x27;s good fortune and thanked the temple priest for his hospitality. As a result, Gōtoku-ji became the family temple of the Ii clan, and the temple prospered under their patronage. In honour of the cat that brought prosperity to the temple, &quot;maneki-neko&quot; was created in later generations.

The second folklore concerns Ōta Dōkan, a warlord of the Muromachi period (1336–1573) who later became the first to build Edo Castle. During the against the Toshima clan, Dōkan was outnumbered and lost his way. It was then that a cat appeared and beckoned him to enter the , where he was later able to turn the tide and win the war. Dōkan was so grateful to the cat that he donated a sculpture of the cat to the temple, and the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; was created in later generations.

The third folklore concerns an old woman who lived near the . She had abandoned her cat out of poverty. One day, the cat came to her in a dream and told her that if she made an ornament of the cat, she would be blessed with good luck. The old woman made an ornament of the cat out of Imado ware, a local speciality, and sold it at the Asakusa Shrine, where it became very popular and made her rich, and the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; was created.

The fourth folklore concerns an &quot;oiran&quot; (courtesan) named Usugumo in Yoshiwara during the Genroku era of the Edo period. Usugumo was an oiran who worked in Miuraya and always carried a cat with her. People rumoured that Usugumo was a woman bewitched by a demonic cat, and the owner of Miuraya, believing the rumour, cut off the cat&#x27;s head and killed it. The cat&#x27;s severed head bit a giant snake lurking in the toilet, saving Usugumo&#x27;s life. A regular customer gave Usugumo, who was grieving over the cat&#x27;s death, a wooden carving in the shape of a cat, which was imitated and sold in Asakusa, giving rise to &quot;maneki-neko&quot;.

According to a folktale, the operator of an impoverished shop (or inn, tavern, temple, etc.) took in a starving stray cat despite barely having enough to feed himself. In gratitude, the cat sat in the front of the store beckoning customers, thus bringing prosperity as a reward to the charitable proprietor. Ever after, the &quot;beckoning cat&quot; has been a symbol of good luck for small business owners.

==Beliefs==
Superstitions about the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; include it being able to &quot;beckon...customers into shops&quot; and &quot;bring good fortune and prosperity into households&quot;, and it being an embodiment of &quot;fertile, life-enhancing feline energies.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Because of its popularity in Chinese communities (including Chinatowns in the United States), the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is therefore sometimes referred to as a &quot;Chinese lucky cat&quot; or &quot;jīnmāo&quot; (&quot;golden cat&quot;). This cat is also prevalent in China domestically, and is usually referred to as .

Hikone City&#x27;s mascot, Hikonyan, a famous mascot in Japan, was created based on the folklore of Ii Naotaka and the &quot;maneki-neko&quot; of Gōtoku-ji Temple. Hikone City is home to Hikone Castle, a National Treasure that was the base of the Ii clan for generations.

For the 2015 Trinidad and Tobago general election, won by the then opposition People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM), a &quot;maneki-neko was&quot; utilized by the PNM in its campaign advertising days before election day, featuring a &quot;maneki-neko&quot; waving goodbye to then Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar alongside headlines of scandals linked to her People&#x27;s Partnership administration taken from the front page of local newspapers.

<doc id="693121" wikidata="Q7274839" url="?curid=693121" title="R62 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R62 is a New York City Subway car model built between 1983 and 1985 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan, for the A Division. A total of 325 cars were built, originally as single units. When the reliability of the fleet improved, they were converted to five-car sets. The cars replaced the remaining R12s, R14s, and R15s, which were all retired by the end of 1984.

The R62 was the first order of A Division cars in 20 years (following the R36 order from 1963), and the first stainless steel subway car built for the A Division. The first cars entered revenue service testing on November 29, 1983, and officially entered service on May 7, 1984. The R62s are scheduled to remain in service until the late-2020s, when they will be replaced with the R262s.

==Description==

The R62s are numbered 1301–1625, totaling 325 cars. Each car was purchased at an average price of US$918,293.

The R62 was the first stainless steel and air-conditioned subway car built for the A Division. A graffiti-resistant glaze was applied to all of the cars because of the extensive graffiti tagging of nearly all of the subway cars in the system since 1969. They continued a controversial interior design by employing bucket seating, which was very narrow, with each seat being about wide. This reduced the number of seats per car when compared to standard bench seating, but allowed for higher standing capacity. This design originated with the R44 and continued through the R68A order. Five cars in the order (1587–1591) were built with bench seating after complaints by passengers upon delivery.

The R62s have full-width cabs at each end of each five-car set, but retain intermediate half-width cabs in the remaining cab positions, as the trains were originally built as single cars.

The R62s also brought back the much more reliable WABCO RT-2 or SMEE braking system after an absence from subway equipment last used on their R42s in 1969. WABCO also discontinued their trouble-prone RT-5 or P-wire braking systems after disastrous results, with continuous teething problems used during the 1970s period.

Currently, most R62s are maintained at the Livonia Yard in Brooklyn and assigned to the , with an additional set maintained at 240th Street Yard and assigned to the .

==History==
===Car order===
After the R36 cars were delivered in 1963–1964, no more IRT cars were built for another 20 years. Several rolling stock orders were proposed for the IRT during this time. In 1966, the Budd Company proposed a lightweight R39 subway car, similar to their M-3 (A49/A50/A51) cars then in use on the Philadelphia Transportation Company&#x27;s (now SEPTA) Market–Frankford Line in Philadelphia, for the oldest elevated IRT and BMT lines; however, this proposal failed because most of the remaining elevated lines were subsequently closed and demolished instead. In 1973, another proposal to replace the R12 through R17 series was deferred because not enough voters approved it. Finally, in 1979, with the bus and train fleets in poor and decrepit shape, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) looked into capital maintenance and bond acts to replace the oldest IRT cars (the R12s, R14s, R15s, and R17s) and to rebuild and refurbish newer (at the time) IRT cars (R21s and beyond). A bond issue for 136 new IRT cars was approved, and funds were procured for another new 1,014 IRT cars in 1981. These cars were referred to as the &quot;R62&quot; contract. The R62 order was originally proposed as an order of 260 cars, each of which were to be long. The selected plan called for 325 IRT cars instead.

In July 1981, the NYCTA began the bidding process for 325 cars under the R62 contract. Nissho-Iwai American Corp, the parent company of Japanese train car builder Kawasaki Heavy Industries, was the lowest bidder for the initial 325 cars, while the American Budd Company submitted a high bid for the initial contract and a low bid for the rest of the cars. The NYCTA did not want to award the large contract to a single builder (as it did in 1975–78 with the R46s, which were plagued by mechanical problems and cracks in the chassis).

The R62 contract was ordered on April 12, 1982, and awarded to Kawasaki Heavy Industries. This was the first time a foreign company was chosen to build cars for the New York City Subway, which was possible since no federal funding was involved. Because a 1981 law now allowed the MTA and suppliers to broker contracts rather than simply accept the lowest bid, the MTA awarded the base contract to Kawasaki.

===Delivery===
The cars entered revenue testing on the on November 29, 1983, and were also tested on the , , and trains. The cars entered service on May 7, 1984, as part of the Car Appearance Program. Soon after delivery, the cars also proved themselves much less prone to breakdowns than previous rolling stock. All 325 cars were in service by August 1985, making the 4 the first entirely graffiti-free service in the system in many years.

Kawasaki did not wish to build the additional cars the MTA wanted as a separate part of the R62 order, under contract R62A, for the same price per car. Bombardier Transportation, an Integrated Transportation rail car company headquartered in Montreal, won a contract to supply these additional 825 cars under a license from Kawasaki.

===Accidents===
On August 28, 1991, a sleep-deprived and intoxicated motorman caused a southbound 4 train to derail north of the 14th Street–Union Square station in Manhattan. The train was diverted from the express track to the local due to repairs, and the motorman sped through the switch at ; as a result, the first car made the switch while several other cars in the consist did not. Five riders were killed, and several dozen were injured. Cars 1435–1437 and 1439–1440 were wrecked in this accident; cars 1435, 1437, and 1439–1440 were scrapped by 2001, while 1436 was reefed in February 2008. The remaining five cars of the consist (cars 1431–1434 and 1438) are now unitized.

On December 21, 1994, disgruntled computer analyst Edward J. Leary firebombed a crowded 4 train at Fulton Street. Car 1391 suffered interior damage, but was repaired and returned to service. A little more than three years later, however, on February 3, 1998, cars 1391–1395, while out of service, was rear-ended by another out-of-service train of R33s at the 239th Street Yard. All five cars suffered anticlimber damage, but were repaired and returned to service.

On October 25, 2000, during the 2000 World Series, a 4 train collided head-on with a work train at the Fordham Road station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line in the Bronx. Car 1369 and one half of 1370 were damaged beyond repair. Car 1366 and the undamaged half of car 1370 were donated to the FDNY Randall&#x27;s Island training center, where they are used as training cars along with R40A 4461. Meanwhile, cars 1367 and 1368 were reefed in February 2008.

===Replacement===
Though no R62s were retired by replacement, the aforementioned accidents caused the premature retirement of ten cars. The remaining cars are expected to be replaced starting around the late 2020s. The MTA proposed mid-life technological upgrades for the R62s in 2010, including LED destination signs and automated announcements.

In January 2019, the MTA announced that it would be replacing the R62/A fleets with the R262s, a new fleet that would be ordered as part of a future capital program.

<text>Tony Joe White (July 23, 1943 – October 24, 2018), nicknamed the Swamp Fox, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his 1969 hit &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; and for &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot;, which he wrote but which was first made popular by Brook Benton in 1970. He also wrote &quot;Steamy Windows&quot; and &quot;Undercover Agent for the Blues&quot;, both hits for Tina Turner in 1989; those two songs came by way of Turner&#x27;s producer at the time, Mark Knopfler, who was a friend of White. &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; was also recorded by Joe Dassin, Elvis Presley, Joe Bonamassa and Tom Jones.

== Biography ==
Tony Joe White was the youngest of seven children who grew up on a cotton farm near Oak Grove, West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, United States. His song &quot;Old Man Willis&quot; takes place in West Carroll Parish. He first began performing music at school dances, and after graduating from high school he performed in night clubs in Texas and Louisiana.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
In 1967, White signed with Monument Records, which operated from a recording studio in the Nashville suburb of Hendersonville, Tennessee, and produced a variety of sounds, including rock and roll, country and western, and rhythm and blues. Billy Swan was his producer on his first three albums.

Over the next three years, White released four singles with no commercial success in the U.S., although &quot;Soul Francisco&quot; was a hit in France. &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; had been released for nine months and written off as a failure by his record label when it finally entered the U.S. charts in July 1969. It climbed to the Top Ten by early August and eventually reached No. 8, becoming White&#x27;s biggest hit.

White&#x27;s first album, 1969&#x27;s &quot;Black and White&quot;, was recorded with Muscle Shoals/Nashville musicians David Briggs, Norbert Putnam, and Jerry Carrigan, and featured &quot;Willie and Laura Mae Jones&quot; and &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;, along with Jimmy Webb&#x27;s &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;. &quot;Willie and Laura Mae Jones&quot; was covered by Dusty Springfield and released as a single, later added to reissues of her 1969 album &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot;.
Three more singles quickly followed, all minor hits, and White toured with Steppenwolf, Anne Murray, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Carpenters and other major rock acts of the 1970s, playing in France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and England.

In 1973, White appeared in the film &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, a rock-opera adaption of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. White played and sang four songs and composed seven for the musical.

In late September 1973, White was recruited by record producer Huey Meaux to sit in on the Memphis sessions that became Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis&quot; album. These sessions were a three-day, around-the-clock party, which not only reunited the original MGs (Steve Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn and Al Jackson, Jr. of Booker T. and the MGs fame) for the first time in three years, but also featured Carl Perkins, Mark Lindsay (of Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders), and Wayne Jackson plus The Memphis Horns.

=== 1980s ===
From 1976 to 1983, White released three more albums, all on different labels. Trying to combine his own swamp-rock sound with the popular disco music at the time, the results were not successful and White gave up his career as a singer and concentrated on writing songs. During this time frame, he collaborated with American expat Joe Dassin on his only English-language album, &quot;Home Made Ice Cream&quot;, and its French-language counterpart, &quot;Blue Country&quot;.

=== 1990s comeback ===
In 1989, White produced one non-single track on Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; album, the rest of the album being produced by Dan Hartman. Playing a variety of instruments on the album, he also wrote four songs, including the title song and the hit single &quot;Steamy Windows&quot;. As a result of this he became managed by Roger Davies, who was Turner&#x27;s manager at the time, and he obtained a new contract with Polydor.

The resulting album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Closer to the Truth&quot;, was a commercial success and put White back in the spotlight. He released two more albums for Polydor: &quot;The Path of a Decent Groove&quot; and &quot;Lake Placid Blues&quot;, which was co-produced by Roger Davies.

In the 1990s, White toured Germany and France with Joe Cocker and Eric Clapton, and in 1992 he played the Montreux Festival. During the late 1990s, White also toured with Waylon Jennings.

In 1996, Tina Turner released the song &quot;On Silent Wings&quot; written by White.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Hip-O Records released &quot;One Hot July&quot; in the U.S., giving White his first new major-label domestic release in 17 years. The critically acclaimed &quot;The Beginning&quot; appeared on Swamp Records in 2001, followed by &quot;Heroines&quot;, featuring several duets with female vocalists including Jessi Colter, Shelby Lynne, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams, and Michelle White, on Sanctuary in 2004, and a live Austin City Limits concert, &quot;Live from Austin, TX&quot;, on New West Records in 2006. In 2004, White was the featured guest artist in an episode of the Legends Rock TV Show and Concert Series, produced by Megabien Entertainment.

In 2007, White released another live recording, &quot;Take Home the Swamp&quot;, as well as the compilation &quot;Introduction to Tony Joe White&quot;. Elkie Brooks recorded one of White&#x27;s songs, &quot;Out of The Rain&quot;, on her 2005 &quot;Electric Lady&quot; album. On July 14, 2006, in Magny-Cours, France, White performed as a warm-up act for Roger Waters&#x27; &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; concert. White&#x27;s album, entitled &quot;Uncovered&quot;, was released in September 2006 and featured collaborations with Mark Knopfler, Michael McDonald, Eric Clapton, and J.J. Cale.

The song &quot;Elements and Things&quot; from the 1969 album &quot;...Continued&quot; features prominently during the horse-racing scenes in the 2012 HBO television series &quot;Luck&quot;.

In 2013, White signed to Yep Roc Records and released &quot;Hoodoo&quot;. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; called the album &quot;Steamy, Irresistible&quot; and &quot;No Depression&quot; noted Tony Joe White is &quot;the real king of the swamp&quot;. He also made his &quot;Live...with Jools Holland&quot; debut in London, playing songs from &quot;Hoodoo&quot;.

On October 15, 2014, White appeared on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; alongside the Foo Fighters to perform &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;. Pointing to White, Letterman told his TV audience, &quot;Holy cow! ... If I was this guy, you could all kiss my ass. And I mean that.&quot;

In May 2016, Tony Joe White released &quot;Rain Crow&quot; on Yep Roc Records. The lead track &quot;Hoochie Woman&quot; was co-written with his wife, Leann. The track &quot;Conjure Child&quot; is a follow-up to an earlier song, &quot;Conjure Woman&quot;.

The album &quot;Bad Mouthin&quot;&#x27; was released in September 2018 again on Yep Roc Records. The album contains six self-penned songs and five blues standards written by, amongst others, Charley Patton and John Lee Hooker. On the album White also performs a cover of the Elvis Presley song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. White plays acoustic and electric guitar on the album which was produced by his son Jody White and it has a signature Tony Joe White laidback sound.

The posthumous album &quot;Smoke from the Chimney&quot; was released May 7, 2021, on Easy Eye Sound. The album features nine vocal and guitar demo recordings of White, fully realized and arranged by producer Dan Auerbach. The tracks feature many top Nashville session players, including drummer Gene Chrisman, keyboardist Bobby Wood, bassist Dave Roe, guitarist Marcus King, and others.

=== Death ===
White died of a heart attack on October 24, 2018 at his home in Leiper&#x27;s Fork, Tennessee, at the age of 75. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t ill at all. He just had a heart attack...there was no pain or suffering&quot;, said his son, Jody White.

<text>Alectryon excelsus, commonly known as tītoki, or sometimes New Zealand oak, is a shiny-leaved tree native to New Zealand. It is in the family Sapindaceae. It lives in coastal and lowland forests throughout most of the North Island and from Banks Peninsula to central Westland in the South Island.

==Description==
&quot;Alectryon excelsus&quot; is a sub-canopy tree growing to in height. It has a twisting trunk with smooth dark bark, spreading branches and pinnate leaves. Adult leaflets do not have marginal teeth or usually have very few, blunt and shallow marginal teeth and usually leaflet margins are downturned, whereas, in juvenile leaflets have leaflets with strong teeth and flat along the edges. The length of this tree leaf are around 10–30 cm. This tree has pale grey to almost black skin with a smooth skin texture and has a stem diameter that reaches 50 cm or more.

&quot;Alectryon excelsus&quot; produces small purple flowers in spring and the seeds take up to a year to mature. The female flower has a small anther (&#x27;without pollen&#x27;) and a short stemmed sari, whereas, the male flower has a long dangling stamen around the vestigial ovary. The colourful seed is initially contained in a hairy woody capsule which splits revealing bright red and black unpalatable fruit (the black portion being the seed).

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Alectryon excelsus&quot; is native to New Zealand but can be found in other places around the world. The tree has been located along street verges in San Francisco.

&quot;A. excelsus&quot; can be found from the North Island to the Westland area of the South Island. The farthest west would be to about Bruce Bay. It is commonly seen in lowland forests from sea level to 600 metres as well as in coastal forests of the North Island. This tree has been seen all over the South Island.

&quot;A. excelsus&quot; is likely to grow anywhere from lowland forest areas and exposed coastal area sites along with sandy plains. In sandy plains, &quot;Alectryon excelsus&quot; is often paired with &quot;Beilschmiedia tawa&quot; (tawa). 

This tree likes to grow in the places that have a lot of water such as wetlands. Tītoki tree gravitates towards moist soil which contains many nutrients for growth along with fertile alluvial and sandy soils. The location characteristics best suited for this tree are: ‘fertile, well-drained soils along riverbanks and associated terraces&#x27;. The plant can grow in conditions from semi-shade to full sun.

== Life cycle/phenology ==
The ovary develops into a hairy and dense capsule with rusty, brown hair. In about one year, the capsule will mature and divide the red flesh tissue that surrounds one large seed. From this cleavage, it will show one large seed which is hidden for one year in the capsule and then, the seeds will fall to the ground and will grow into trees if they fall in the right place to support the growth of the tree or the seeds will be spread by New Zealand birds such as the tūī, kererū, kōkako and black birds. This tree will flower from spring to early summer. Some flowers of this tree are bisexual because female flowers and male flowers are not borne on the same tree.

== Predators, parasites and diseases ==
Predators

The fruit of this tree is usually eaten by possums and birds. Some insects enjoy chewing the bark and the leaves. In addition, the leaves on a small tītoki tree will be targeted by deer.

Parasites

The parasite known as the tītoki fruit borer destroys the seeds of this tree by living inside the capsule and eating the seeds.

== Uses ==
The tītoki tree is one of the native trees in New Zealand that was traditionally planted by Māori. Usually, the pulp fruit from this tree is consumed by Māori while the wood is commonly used for making trainers and wheels because the wood is very elastic and strong. 

Furthermore, grains from this tree are used and processed into hair oil and the leaves of this tree will be soaked in the oil to provide a fragrant aroma. The production of oil is very traditional by crushing the tītoki seeds which are later added to a tourniquet-style hemp bag or an elongated woven basket called &quot;ngehingehi&quot; (akin to a Brazilian &quot;tipiti&quot;) that Māori will extract with to release a greenish oil.

People now use the fruit for liquor production. The fruit attributes sweet and astringent taste factors to the alcohol. This product has been distilled and exported to Australia, Fiji, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="693126" wikidata="Q477449" url="?curid=693126" title="Salt dome">
<text>A salt dome is a type of structural dome formed when salt (or other evaporite minerals) intrudes into overlying rocks in a process known as diapirism. Salt domes can have unique surface and subsurface structures, and they can be discovered using techniques such as seismic reflection. They are important in petroleum geology as they can function as petroleum traps.

==Formation==

Stratigraphically, salt basins developed periodically from the Proterozoic to the Neogene. The formation of a salt dome begins with the deposition of salt in a restricted basin. In these basins, the outflow of water exceeds inflow. Specifically, the basin loses water through evaporation, resulting in the precipitation and deposition of salt. While the rate of sedimentation of salt is significantly larger than the rate of sedimentation of clastics, it is recognized that a single evaporation event is rarely enough to produce the vast quantities of salt needed to form a layer thick enough for the formation of salt diapirs, indicating that a sustained period of episodic flooding and evaporation of the basin must occur.

Over time, the layer of salt is covered with deposited sediment, becoming buried under an increasingly large overburden. Previously, researchers believed that the compaction of overlying sediment and subsequent decrease in buoyancy led to salt rising and intruding into the overburden due to its ductility, thereby creating a salt diapir. However, after the 1980s, the primary force that drives the flow of salt is considered to be differential loading.

Differential loading can be caused by gravitational forces (gravitational loading), forced displacement of salt boundaries (displacement loading), or thermal gradients (thermal loading). The flow of the salt overcomes the strength of the overburden as well as boundary friction aided by overburden extension, erosion, thrust faults, ductile thinning, or other forms of regional deformation. The vertical growth of salt formations creates pressure on the upward surface, causing extension and faulting. Once the salt completely pierces the overburden, it can rise through a process known as passive diapirism where the accumulation of sediments around the diapir contribute to its growth and eventually form into a dome.

== Discovery mechanisms ==
Some salt domes can be seen from Earth&#x27;s surface. They can also be located by finding unique surface structures and surrounding phenomena. For instance, salt domes can contain or be near sulfur springs and natural gas vents. Some salt domes have salt sheets that extrude from the top of the dome; these are referred to as salt plugs. These plugs can coalesce to form salt canopies, which can then be remobilized by roof sedimentation, with the most prominent example in the northern Gulf of Mexico basin. Another structure that can form from salt domes are salt welds. These occur when the growth of a dome is prevented by an exhausted supply of salt, and the top and bottom contacts merge.

Salt domes have also been located using seismic refraction and seismic reflection. The latter was developed based on techniques from the former and is more effective. Seismic refraction uses seismic waves to characterize subsurface geologic conditions and structures. Seismic reflection highlights the presence of a stark density contrast between the salt and surrounding sediment. Seismic techniques are particularly effective as salt domes are typically depressed blocks of crust bordered by parallel normal faults (graben) that can be flanked by reverse faults. Advances in seismic reflection and the expansion of offshore petroleum exploration efforts led to the discovery of numerous salt domes soon after World War II.

== Commercial uses ==
Salt domes are the site of many of the world&#x27;s hydrocarbon provinces. The rock salt of the salt dome is mostly impermeable, so, as it moves up towards the surface, it penetrates and bends existing rock along with it. As strata of rock are penetrated, they are, generally, bent upwards where they meet the dome, forming pockets and reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas (known as petroleum traps). In 1901, an exploratory oil well was drilled into Spindletop Hill near Beaumont, Texas. This led to the discovery of the first salt dome, revealed the importance of salt to the formation of hydrocarbon accumulations, and produced enough oil for petroleum to become an economically feasible fuel for the United States. Several countries use solution mining to form caverns for holding large amounts of oil or gas reserves.

The caprock above the salt domes can contain deposits of native sulfur (recovered by the Frasch process). They can also contain deposits of metals, sodium salts, nitrates, and other substances, which can be used in products such as table salt and chemical de-icers.

==Occurrence==
Salt domes occur in many parts of the world where there is a sufficiently thick layer of rock salt developed.

===Hormuz Formation===
In the Middle East, the upper Neoproterozoic salt of the Hormuz Formation is associated with widespread salt dome formation in most parts of the Persian Gulf and onshore in Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and Oman. The thicker salt is found in a series of basins: the Western Gulf, the Southern Gulf, and the Oman salt basins.

===Paradox Basin===
Pennsylvanian age salt of the Paradox Formation forms salt domes throughout the Paradox Basin in the US, which extends from eastern Utah, through southwestern Colorado into northwestern New Mexico.

An example of an emergent salt dome is at Onion Creek, Utah / Fisher Towers near Moab, Utah. A Paradox Formation salt body that has risen as a ridge through several hundred meters of overburden, predominantly sandstone. As the salt body rose, the overburden formed an anticline (arching upward along its center line) which fractured and eroded to expose the salt body.

===Barents Sea===
Offshore northern Norway in the southwestern Barents Sea, thick Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian salt was deposited, forming salt domes in the Hammerfest and Nordkapp basins.

===Zechstein basin===
In northwest Europe Upper Permian salt of the Zechstein Group has formed salt domes over the central and southern North Sea, extending eastwards into Germany.

===Morocco–Nova Scotia===
Upper Triassic salt forms salt domes in the Essaouira Basin onshore and offshore Morocco. An equivalent salt sequence, the Argo Formation, is associated with salt dome formation on the conjugate Nova Scotia margin.

===Gulf of Mexico===

The Gulf Coast is home to over 500 salt domes formed from Middle Jurassic Louann Salt. This region is home to most of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Avery Island was formed by a salt dome.

===South Atlantic salt basins===
During the break-up of the south Atlantic, Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) age salt was deposited within the area of thinned crust on both the Brazilian and conjugate Angola/Gabon margins forming many salt domes.

===Messinian salt===
During the Messinian salinity crisis (Late Miocene), thick salt layers were formed as the Mediterranean Sea dried out. Later deposition, once the sea refilled, triggered the formation of salt domes.

<text>Tourism in Indonesia is an important component of the Indonesian economy as well as a significant source of its foreign exchange revenues. Indonesia was ranked at 20th in the world tourist Industry in 2017, also ranked as the ninth-fastest growing tourist sector in the world, the third-fastest growing in Asia and fastest-growing in Southeast Asia. In 2018, Denpasar, Jakarta and Batam are among of 10 cities in the world with fastest growth in tourism, 32.7, 29.2 and 23.3 percent respectively. The tourism sector ranked as the 4th largest among goods and services export sectors.
On 2019, Indonesia recorded 16.10 million foreign tourist arrivals, seeing a 1.9% per cent increase than that of 2018. In 2015, 9.73 million international visitors entered Indonesia, staying in hotels for an average of 7.5 nights and spending an average of US$1,142 per person during their visit, or US$152.22 per person per day. Singapore, Malaysia, China, Australia, and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia.

The &quot;Travel and Tourism Development Index 2024&quot; ranks Indonesia 22nd out of 119 countries overall with Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index score of 4.46. This is a significant improvement for Indonesian tourism sector. Previously in 2019 Indonesia ranks 40th out of 140 countries overall with index score of 4.3. It is a two steps improvement from Indonesia&#x27;s 2017 position of 42nd out of 136 countries overall with index score of 4.2. The 2015 report ranks the price competitiveness of Indonesia&#x27;s tourism sector the 3rd out of 141 countries. It mentions that Indonesia has quite good travel and tourism policy and enabling conditions (ranked 9th). The country also scores quite good on natural and cultural resources (ranked 17th). However, the country scored rather low in infrastructure sub-index (ranked 75th), as some aspects of tourist service infrastructure are underdeveloped.

In 2016, the government was reported to be investing more in tourism development by attracting more foreign investors. The government has given priority to 10 destinations as follows: Borobudur, Central Java; Mandalika, West Nusa Tenggara; Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara; Bromo-Tengger-Semeru, East Java; Thousand Islands, Jakarta; Lake Toba, North Sumatra; Wakatobi, Southeast Sulawesi; Tanjung Lesung, Banten; Morotai, North Maluku; and Tanjung Kelayang, Bangka Belitung Islands. As quoted in &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot;, the government is aiming for 275 million trips by domestic tourists by end of 2019. The government has also secured commitments from potential investors, totalling US$70 million in the areas of building accommodation, marina and ecotourism facilities in 3 of the 10 areas. Indonesia is ranked at seventh place in the list of Lonely Planet&#x27;s top 10 countries to visit in 2019. The country ranks fourth out of the top 25 destinations in the world in 2018 by travel site TripAdvisor.
== Overview ==
Both nature and culture are major components of Indonesian tourism. The natural heritage can boast a unique combination of a tropical climate, a vast archipelago of 17,508 islands, 6,000 of them being inhabited, the second longest shoreline in the world (54,716 km) after Canada. It is the world&#x27;s largest and most populous country situated only on islands. The beaches in Bali, diving sites in Bunaken, Mount Bromo in East Java, Lake Toba and various national parks in Sumatra are just a few examples of popular scenic destinations. These natural attractions are complemented by a rich cultural heritage that reflects Indonesia&#x27;s dynamic history and ethnic diversity. One fact that exemplifies this richness is that 719 living languages are used across the archipelago. The ancient Prambanan and Borobudur temples, Toraja, Yogyakarta, Minangkabau, and of course Bali, with its many Hindu festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.

Indonesia is a member of PATA and was the host of its annual conference in 1963 and 1974 in Jakarta, and in 2003 in Bali. Indonesia also was the host of PATA Travel Mart in 1985 and 1989 in Bali, and 2016 in Jakarta.

Tourism in Indonesia is currently overseen by the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism. International tourism campaigns have been focusing largely on its tropical destinations with white sand beaches, blue sky, and cultural attractions. Beach resorts and hotels have been developed in some popular tourist destinations, especially Bali island as the primary destination. At the same time, the integration of cultural affairs and tourism under the scope of the same ministry shows that cultural tourism is considered an integral part of Indonesia&#x27;s tourism industry, and conversely, that tourism is used to promote and preserve the cultural heritage.

Some of the challenges Indonesia&#x27;s tourism industry has to face include the development of infrastructure to support tourism across the sprawling archipelago, incursions of the industry into local traditions (adat), and the impact of tourism development on the life of local people. The tourism industry in Indonesia has also faced setbacks due to problems related to security. Since 2002, warnings have been issued by some countries over terrorist threats and ethnic as well as religious conflicts in some areas, significantly reducing the number of foreign visitors for a few years. However, the number of international tourists has bounced back positively since 2007, and reached a new record in 2008 and kept rising since then.

The 2019 &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report&quot; ranks Indonesia 40th out of 140 countries overall with a score of 4.3. It lists the price competitiveness of Indonesia&#x27;s tourism sector the sixth out of 140 countries. The report states that Indonesia scores well on visa policy (#3) and international openness (#16), as well as on natural (#17) and cultural resources (#24). However, Indonesia has a low score in infrastructure (#98), as some aspects of tourist service infrastructure are underdeveloped. Other aspects that need to be improved include health and hygiene, environmental sustainability, and affinity for travel and tourism.

=== Historical context ===

Indonesia seems to have been a travel destination for centuries. Some panels in Borobudur bas-reliefs depicted drink vendors, &quot;warungs&quot; (small restaurants), tavern or lodgings where people were drinking and dancing. The historical record of travel in Indonesia can be found since the 14th century. The Nagarakretagama reported that King Hayam Wuruk&#x27;s royal travel throughout Majapahit realm in East Java had large numbers of carriages, accompanied by nobles, royal courtiers, officials and servants. Although it seems like a stately affair, in some instances the king&#x27;s trip somewhat resembles a modern-day tour, as the king visited multiple modern tourism sites; from temples such as Palah and Jajawa, to enjoy the mountain scenery, having a bath in &quot;petirtaan&quot; (bathing pools) and going to the beach. The 15th-century travelogue of Bujangga Manik, a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from Pakuan Pajajaran, reported about his travel around Java and Bali. Although his travel was a pilgrimage one; visiting temples and sacred places in Java and Bali, sometimes he behaves like a modern-day tourist, such as sitting around fanning his body while enjoying beautiful mountain scenery in Puncak area, looking at Gede volcano that he describes as the highest point around Pakuan Pajajaran (capital of Sunda kingdom).

Initially the tourism, service and hospitality sector in Dutch East Indies were developed to cater the lodging, entertainment and leisure needs of domestic visitors, especially the wealthy Dutch plantation owners and merchants during their stay in the city. In the 19th century, colonial heritage hotels equipped with dance halls, live music and fine dining restaurants were established in Dutch East Indies urban areas, such as Hotel des Indes (est. 1829) in Batavia (now Jakarta), Savoy Homann Hotel (est. 1871) in Bandung, Hotel Oranje (est. 1910) in Surabaya, and Hotel De Boer in Medan. Since the 19th century Dutch East Indies has attracted visitors from The Netherlands. The first national tourism bureau was the &quot;Vereeniging Toeristen Verkeer&quot;, established by Governor-General of Dutch East Indies in early 20th century, and shared their head office in Batavia with &quot;Koninklijke Nederlansch Indische Luchtfahrt Maatschapijj&quot; or &quot;KNILM&quot; (which is not a KLM subsidiary despite the similar name) that began to fly from Amsterdam to Batavia in 1929. In 1913, &quot;Vereeneging Touristen Verkeer&quot; wrote a guide book about tourism places in the Indies. Since then Bali become known to international tourist with foreign tourist arrivals rose for more than 100% in 1927. Much of the international tourism of the 1920s and 1930s was by international visitors on oceanic cruises. The 1930s did see a modest but significant influx of mainly European tourists and long term stayers to Bali. Many came for the blossoming arts scene in the Ubud area, which was as much a two-way exchange between the Balinese and outsiders as it was an internal phenomenon.
Tourism more or less disappeared during World War II, Indonesian National Revolution and in the early years of the Sukarno era. On 1 July 1947, the government of Republic of Indonesia tried to revive tourism sector in Indonesia by establishing HONET (&quot;Hotel National &amp; Tourism&quot;) led by R. Tjitpo Ruslan. This new national tourism authority took over many of the colonial heritage hotels in Java and renamed them all &quot;Hotel Merdeka&quot;. After Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference in 1949, this tourism authority changed its name to NV HORNET. In 1952 the President formed the Inter-Departement 4 on Tourism Affairs which is responsible for reestablishing Indonesia as the world&#x27;s tourism destination.

National pride and identity in the late 1950s and early 1960s was incorporated into the monumentalism of Sukarno in Jakarta and this included the development of grand multi-storied international standard hotels and beach resorts, such as Hotel Indonesia in Jakarta (est. 1962), Ambarrukmo Hotel in Yogyakarta (est. 1965), Samudra Beach Hotel in Pelabuhan Ratu beach West Java (est. 1966), and Inna Grand Bali Beach Hotel in Bali (est. 1966). The political and economic instability of the mid-1960s saw tourism decline radically again. Bali, and in particular the small village of Kuta, was, however, in the 1960s, an important stopover on the overland hippy trail between Australia and Europe, and a &quot;secret&quot; untouched surf spot.

To stimulate tourism sector, Indonesia becomes a member of PATA in the early 1960s and appointed as the host of PATA annual conference in 1963 and 1974 in Jakarta, and 2003 in Bali. To host the 1974 PATA conference, the Hotel Borobudur was built and named as the official hotel of this event. At that time, it was the largest and the most luxurious hotel in Jakarta. Indonesia is also the host of PATA Travel Mart in 1985 and 1989 in Bali, and 2016 in Jakarta.

In the early-to-mid-1970s, high standard hotels and tourist facilities began to appear in Jakarta and Bali. After the completion of Borobudur restoration project in 1982, Yogyakarta become a popular tourist destination in Indonesia after Bali, mostly attracted to this 8th-century Buddhist monument, surrounding ancient Javanese temples and Yogyakarta Sultanate palace. From this period to the end of the Suharto era, governmental policies of the tourism industry included an array of regulations and developments to encourage increasing numbers of international tourists to both visit Indonesia and stay longer.

== Statistics ==
=== Tourist arrivals by nationality ===
Source: Statistics Indonesia

The ten most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia recorded by Central Statistics Agency (BPS) are Bali, West Java, Central Java, East Java, Jakarta, North Sumatra, Lampung, South Sulawesi, South Sumatra, Banten, and West Sumatra (which would make it 11 provinces today due to Banten previously having been a part of West Java).

As with most countries, domestic tourists are by far the largest market segment. The biggest movement of domestic tourists is during the annual Eid al-Fitr, locally known as &quot;lebaran&quot;. During this period, which is a two-week holiday after the month of fasting during Ramadan, many city-dwelling Muslim Indonesians visit relatives in their home towns. Intercity traffic is at its peak and often an additional surcharge is applied during this time.

Over the five years up to 2006, attention has been focused on generating more domestic tourism. Competition amongst budget airlines has increased the number of domestic air travellers throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry of Labour legislated to create long weekends by combining public holidays that fall close to weekends, except in the case of important religious holidays. During these long weekends, most hotels in popular destinations are fully booked.

Since 2000, on average, there have been five million foreign tourists each year (see table), who spend an average of per day. With an average visit duration of 9–12 days, Indonesia gains billion of foreign exchange income annually. This makes tourism Indonesia&#x27;s third most important non-oil–gas source of foreign revenue, after timber and textile products.

After toppled Japan two years ago, China as the world&#x27;s biggest tourism spenders now toppled Australia to become number three with 30.42 per cent increase year-on-year (y-o-y), while foreign tourists growth by 10.6 per cent y-o-y set to more than 2.9 million. The top countries of origin Q1 2014 data comes from the Asia-Pacific region, with Singapore (15.7 per cent), Malaysia (14.0), China (11.0), Australia, and Japan among the top countries of origin.

Around 59% of all visitors are travelling to Indonesia for holiday purposes, while 38% for business.

In 2012, according to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, travel and tourism made a total contribution of 8.9% of GDP and supported 8% of total employment in Indonesia.

== Nature tourism ==

Indonesia has a well-preserved, natural ecosystem with rainforests that stretch over about 57% of Indonesia&#x27;s land (), approximately 2% of which are mangrove systems. One reason why the natural ecosystem in Indonesia is still well-preserved is because only 6,000 islands out of 17,000 are permanently inhabited. Forests on Sumatra and Java are examples of popular tourist destinations. Moreover, Indonesia has one of longest coastlines in the world, measuring , with a number of beaches and island resorts, such as those in southern Bali, Lombok, Bintan and Nias Island. However, most of the well-preserved beaches are those in more isolated and less developed areas, such as Karimunjawa, the Togian Islands, and the Banda Islands.

=== Dive sites ===

With more than 17,508 islands, Indonesia presents ample diving opportunities. With 20% of the world&#x27;s coral reefs, over 3,000 different species of fish and 600 coral species, deep water trenches, volcanic sea mounts, World War II wrecks, and a very large variety of macro life, scuba diving in Indonesia is both excellent and relatively inexpensive. Bunaken National Marine Park, at the northern tip of Sulawesi, claims to have seven times more genera of coral than Hawaii, and has more than 70% of all the known fish species of the Western Indo-Pacific. Moreover, there are over 3,500 species living in Indonesian waters, including sharks, dolphins, manta rays, turtles, morays, cuttlefish, octopus and scorpionfish, compared to 1,500 on the Great Barrier Reef and 600 in the Red Sea. Tulamben Bay in Bali has the wreck of the US Army commissioned transport vessel, the . Other popular dive sites on Bali are at Candidasa and Menjangan. Across the Badung Strait from Bali, there are several popular dive sites on Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida. Lombok&#x27;s three Gilis (Gili Air, Gili Meno and Gili Trawangan) are popular, as is Bangka. Saronde Island is a very popular spot also in Gorontalo, Sulawesi. Some of the most famous diving sites in Indonesia are also the most difficult to reach, with places like Biak off the coast of Papua and the Alor Archipelago among the popular, more remote, destinations for divers.

=== Surf breaks ===

Surfing is also a popular water activity in Indonesia and the sites are recognised as world-class. The well-known locations are mostly located on the southern, Indian Ocean side of Indonesia, the largest breaks being on southern Java. The north coast does not receive the same surf from the Java Sea. Surf breaks can be found all the way along Sumatra, down to Nusa Tenggara, including Aceh, Bali, Banten, Java, Lombok, the Mentawai Islands, and Sumbawa. Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers come from abroad, especially Australia and the United States. Local enthusiasm for surfing began at Bali and West Java&#x27;s Pelabuhan Ratu and Pangandaran beaches, with most surfers arriving from nearby cities of Jakarta and Bandung.

In 2018, World Surf League had eight surfing events in Indonesia.

On Bali, there are about 33 surf locations, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan. In Sumbawa, Hu&#x27;u and Lakey Beach in Cempi Bay are popular spots among surfing enthusiasts. Sumatra is the island, with the second greatest number of surf spots, with 18 altogether. High season for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds tend to come from the west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.

Two well-known surf breaks in Indonesia are the G-Land in the Bay of Grajagan, East Java, and Lagundri Bay at the southern end of Nias island. G-Land was first identified in 1972 when a surfer saw the break from the window of a plane. Since 6 to 8-foot (Hawaiian scale) waves were discovered by surfers at Lagundri Bay in 1975, the island has become famous for surfing worldwide.

=== National parks ===
Bogor Botanical Gardens established in 1817, and Cibodas Botanical Gardens established in 1862, are two among the oldest botanical gardens in Asia. With rich collections of tropical plants, these gardens are the centre of botanical research as well as tourism attraction since the colonial era.

There are 50 national parks in Indonesia, of which six are World Heritage listed. The largest national parks in Sumatra are the Gunung Leuser National Park, the Kerinci Seblat National Park and the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, all three recognised as Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Other national parks on the list are Lorentz National Park in Papua, Komodo National Park in the Lesser Sunda Islands, and Ujung Kulon National Park in the west of Java.

To be noticed, different national parks offer different biodiversity, as the natural habitat in Indonesia is divided into two areas by the Wallace line. The Wallacea biogeographical distinction means the western part of Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) have the same flora and fauna characteristics as the Asian continent, whilst the remaining eastern part of Indonesia has similarity with the Australian continent.

Many native species such as Sumatran elephants, Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros and orangutans are listed as endangered or critically endangered, and the remaining populations are found in national parks and other conservation areas. Sumatran orangutan can be visited in the Bukit Lawang conservation area, while the Bornean orangutan can be visited in Tanjung Puting national park, Central Kalimantan. The world&#x27;s largest flower, rafflesia arnoldi, and the tallest flower, titan arum, can be found in Sumatra.

The east side of the Wallacea line offers the most remarkable, rarest, and exotic animals on earth. Birds-of-paradise, locally known as &quot;cendrawasih&quot;, are plumed birds that can be found among other fauna in Papua New Guinea. The largest bird in Papua is the flightless cassowary. One species of lizard, the Komodo dragon can easily be found on Komodo, located in the Nusa Tenggara lesser islands region. Besides Komodo island, this endangered species can also be found on the islands of Rinca, Padar and Flores.

=== Volcanoes ===
Hiking and camping in the mountains are popular adventure activities. Some mountains contain ridge rivers, offering rafting activity. Though volcanic mountains can be dangerous, they have become major tourist destinations. Several tourists have died on the slopes of Mount Rinjani, Indonesia&#x27;s second-highest volcano and a popular destination for climbers visiting Lombok in eastern Indonesia. Popular active volcanoes are the high Mount Bromo in the East Java province with its scenic volcanic desert around the crater, the upturned boat shaped Tangkuban Perahu and the volcanic crater Kawah Putih, north and south of Bandung respectively and both with drive-in access up to the crater, the most active volcano in Java, Mount Merapi near Yogyakarta, and the legendary Krakatau with its new caldera known as &quot;Anak Krakatau&quot; (the child of Krakatau). Gede Pangrango volcano in West Java is also a popular hiking destination, especially among domestic hikers.

In Sumbawa, Mount Tambora with its historical massive volcanic eruption back in 1815 that produced massive caldera also had gained attention among hikers. In the neighbouring island of Flores, the three-coloured volcanic crater-lake of Kelimutu is also hailed as one of Indonesia&#x27;s natural wonder and had attracted visitors worldwide. Puncak Jaya in the Lorentz National Park, the highest mountain in Indonesia and one of the few mountains with ice caps at the (tropical) equator offers the opportunity of rock climbing. In Sumatra, there are the remains of a supervolcano eruption that have created the landscape of Lake Toba close to Medan in North Sumatra.

== Cultural tourism ==
Indonesia consists of over 600 ethnic groups, spread over a 1.8 million km2 area of 6,000 inhabited islands. This creates a cultural diversity, further compounded by Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic and European colonialist influences. In Bali, where most of Indonesian Hindus live, cultural and religious festivals with Balinese dance-drama performances in Balinese temples are major attractions to foreign tourists.

Despite foreign influences, a diverse array of indigenous traditional cultures is still evident in Indonesia. The indigenous ethnic group of Toraja in South Sulawesi, still has a strong tradition that descends from animistic beliefs even though most Toraja are Christian now. One of the most famous Toraja tradition is their funeral rites, Rambu Solo. The Minangkabau ethnic group retain a unique matrilineal culture, despite being devoted Muslims. Other indigenous ethnic groups include the Asmat and Dani in Papua, the Dayak in Kalimantan and the Mentawai in Sumatra, where traditional rituals are still observed.
Cultural tourism also plays a significant part in Yogyakarta, a special province in Indonesia known as the centre of classical Javanese fine art and culture. The rise and fall of Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic kingdoms in Central Java has transformed Yogyakarta into a melting pot of Indonesian culture. Classical Javanese dances are performed in royal courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, as well as Javanese Ramayana Ballet performed in Prambanan open-air theatre.

Most major Indonesian cities have their state-owned museums, although most are in modest display. The most complete and comprehensive museum that displaying Indonesian culture and history spanned from prehistoric to colonial era is National Museum of Indonesia located in Jakarta.

For Indonesian and foreign visitors unable to visit all Indonesian provinces, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah in East Jakarta provides a comprehensive microcosm of Indonesian culture. Established in 1975 by Tien Suharto, this park displaying museums, separate pavilions with the collections of Indonesian architecture, clothing, dances and traditions all depicted impeccably.

=== Ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples ===
From the 4th century until the 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism shaped the culture of Indonesia. Kingdoms rise and fall, such as Mataram Kingdom, Srivijaya, Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit. Along with the Indonesian classical history of Hindu-Buddhist era, they produced some temples and monuments called &quot;candi&quot;. The best-preserved Buddhist shrine, which was built during the Sailendra dynasty in the 8th century, is Borobudur temple in Central Java. A giant stone mandala stepped pyramid adorned with bell-shaped stupas, richly adorned with bas-reliefs telling the stories and teachings of Buddha.

A few kilometres to the southeast is the Prambanan complex, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia built during the second Mataram dynasty. The Prambanan temple is dedicated to Trimurti; Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, three highest gods in Hinduism. Both the Borobudur and the Prambanan temple compounds have been listed in the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1991. Both temple are the largest and the most popular, conveniently accessible from Yogyakarta, the heartland of Javanese culture. The Ramayana Javanese dance is performed routinely on the stage near Prambanan temple, provides the visitors with the glimpse of Javanese classical culture.

In and around Jogjakarta, the ancient Javanese archaeology and temple enthusiast may still discover numerous ancient temples, accessible by car or motorcycle. Although not as grand and popular as Borobudur and Prambanan, these smaller temples provide a glimpse of ancient culture and the intricate details of ancient Java temple architecture. Mendut and Pawon temples are located in Kedu Plain near Borobudur, while Ratu Boko, Sewu, Lumbung, Plaosan, Kalasan, and Sari are located in Prambanan Plain near Prambanan temple.

The temples of East Java dated from the era of Singhasari and Majapahit; mostly located in Trowulan archaeological site, and also scattered around Blitar and Malang. Although not as grand and popular as the temples of Central Java, the East Javanese temples are also an interesting destination for candi and Indonesian ancient history enthusiast. East Javanese temples such as Wringin Lawang, Brahu, Bajang Ratu, and Candi Tikus in Trowulan archaeological site. Jawi temple near Pandaan, south of Surabaya, Penataran temple in Blitar, Kidal temple and Singhasari temple near Malang.

Most major Indonesian archaeological sites are equipped with museums; such as Samudra Raksa Museum and Karmawibhangga Museum in Borobudur, Prambanan museum in Prambanan temple compounds, and Trowulan Museum located in former Majapahit capital of Trowulan archaeological site. Some of the archaeological discoveries are also displayed in municipal museums, such as Sonobudoyo Museum in Yogyakarta and Radyapustaka Museum in Surakarta, and of course the Indonesian National Museum in Jakarta.

Sumatra also home of several ancient Buddhist temples mostly linked to Srivijaya kingdom, such as Muaro Jambi in Jambi province, Muara Takus in Riau and Biaro Bahal in North Sumatra. Sumatran temples, however, are not as elaborated and as spectacular as its Javanese counterpart, and subsequently less popular. The location is rural, quite far from large cities, so renting a car to visit these sites is advisable since public transportation to the location is scarce.

=== Islamic heritage ===

Islam has also contributed greatly to the cultural society in Indonesia. As of 2006, 88% of Indonesia&#x27;s recorded population were Muslim. Islamic culture is prominent in Sumatra, and a few of the remaining sultanate palaces can be seen in Medan and Tanjung Pinang.

The Islamic heritage tourism is also popular, especially among Indonesian Muslims and Muslims from neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei that shared common Southeast Asian Islamic heritage. The activity usually linked with Islamic ziyarat pilgrimage to historical Islamic sites, such as historical mosques and tombs of venerated Islamic figures. However, for visitors in Islamic sites, either local or foreign, Muslim or non-Muslim, the rules of conduct and dress modesty is applied, such as removing the footwear while entering mosques or &quot;makam&quot; (tombs), a visitor should not enter the site wearing shorts (sarong usually lent near the entrance to cover the lower torso of the visitors).

In Aceh the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque and tombs of Aceh Sultanate kings is a popular destination, while in Medan the Medan Great Mosque and Maimun Palace is also major Islamic heritage destination. Most of the Indonesian major cities have their own historical or monumental &quot;Masjid Agung&quot; (Grand Mosque) that become city&#x27;s landmark as well as a tourism attraction. Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, the Indonesian national mosque and the largest in Southeast Asia is Jakarta&#x27;s major landmark as well as a tourist attraction.

In Java the ziyarat pilgrimage is usually linked to historically important Islamic figures of Wali Sanga (Nine Saints), they are important because of their historic role in the Spread of Islam in Indonesia. Their tombs and mosques scattered along with Java&#x27;s north coast towns, such as Demak, Kudus, Cirebon, Gresik, to Ampel in Surabaya. The 15th-century Agung Demak Mosque hailed as the first mosque established in Java. Menara Kudus Mosque is notable for incorporating Majapahit Hindu-Javanese architecture. The tomb of Sunan Gunungjati near Cirebon, is also the important ziyarat site in West Java.

The heritage tourism might also be focused on the era of 17th- to 19th-century royal Javanese courts of Yogyakarta Sultanate, Surakarta Sunanate and Mangkunegaran.

=== Colonial heritage ===

The heritage tourism is focused on specific interest on Indonesian history, such as colonial architectural heritage of Dutch East Indies era in Indonesia. The colonial heritage tourism mostly attracted visitors from the Netherlands that share historical ties with Indonesia, as well as Indonesian or foreign colonial history enthusiast.

The popular heritage tourism attractions are Kota – the centre of old Jakarta, with its Maritime Museum, Kota Intan drawbridge, Gereja Sion, Wayang Museum, Stadhuis Batavia, Fine Art and Ceramic Museum, Toko Merah, Bank Indonesia Museum, Bank Mandiri Museum, Jakarta Kota railway station, and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown). In the old ports of Sunda Kelapa, in Jakarta and Paotere in Makassar the tall-masted pinisi ship still sailed. The Jakarta Cathedral with neo-gothic architecture in Central Jakarta also attracted architecture enthusiast.

Bandung historical avenue around Asia Afrika and Braga Street displays rich collections of Indies and Art deco architecture from early 20th century. Several hotels such as Savoy Homann in Bandung and Hotel Majapahit in Surabaya are colonial heritage hotels suitable for those whom interested in Dutch East Indies colonial history. The VOC forts can be found in Yogyakarta, Makassar, Bengkulu and Ambon. The colonial buildings might also be found in old town parts of Indonesian cities, such as Semarang, Surabaya, Malang, Medan, and Sawahlunto.

=== Village tourism ===
Village tourism (Indonesian: &quot;desa wisata&quot;) is a tourism concept in Indonesia to integrate attraction, activity, accommodation, and supporting facility within a specific area, called &quot;desa&quot; or village, to maximize tourism potential of that specific area. Unlike popular resorts area that mostly owned by global hotel chains, village tourism is usually modest small scale family or community-owned accommodations; i.e. boarding house, guest house, bed and breakfast, lodge, tavern, restaurant or &quot;warung&quot; shop. This community-based tourism model is intended to generate the local economy, create jobs, as well as empowering the local community.

Indonesia has rich and diverse culinary traditions, and might be considered as one of the richest and the best in the world; such as rendang that recently voted as the number one dish of CNN International &#x27;World&#x27;s 50 Most Delicious Foods&#x27; list. Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences.

In Indonesia, prostitution is illegal and interpreted as a &quot;crime against decency and morality&quot;. In practice, however, prostitution is quite widespread, tolerated, and somewhat regulated, mostly illegally or underground in discotheques, massage parlours, and karaoke rooms, and also visible on certain streets.

=== Indonesian tourism campaigns ===
The official Indonesian government authority that is responsible for the tourism sector in Indonesia is the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Indonesia. Several campaigns to promote Indonesian tourism have been launched, either by government or private sectors through various media such as print, television, and online.

Visit Indonesia Year 1991
Learning from neighbouring countries&#x27; success, such as Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, which successfully gained benefits and exploited their tourism sectors through intensive promotions, in the early 1990s the Indonesian government launched integrated efforts to promote Indonesian tourism worldwide. The first integrated campaign was coined as Visit Indonesia Year, and the first year was the &quot;Visit Indonesia Year 1991&quot;.

Visit Indonesia Year 2008
The Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Tourism declared 2008 as a Visit Indonesia Year. Visit Indonesia Year 2008 was officially launched on 26 December 2007. The figure of Visit Indonesia Year 2008 branding took the concept of Garuda Pancasila as the Indonesian way of life. The five components of Pancasila were represented by five different coloured lines and symbolised the Indonesian &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;. The targeted number was 7 million. Visit Indonesia Year 2008 also commemorated 100 years of Indonesia&#x27;s national awakening in 1908.

Visit Indonesia Year 2009

Tourism Indonesia Mart &amp; Expo (TIME) 2009 was held at Santosa Villas &amp; Resort in Senggigi on the west coast of Lombok NTB. Entering its 16th year of conduct, TIME 2009 was organised by the Indonesian Tourism Promotion Board (ITPB) and received the support of a wide number of tour participants in Indonesia.

TIME 2009 attracted 127 buyers from 25 countries. The top five buyers were from Korea, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the United States, and the Netherlands. TIME 2009 also attracted a total of 250 delegates of Sellers from 97 companies of Indonesia occupying 84 booths at the exhibition.

Amidst current global financial crisis, TIME 2009 booked an estimated of the transaction of million, or increasing 15% from the previous TIME held in Makassar, South Sulawesi in 2008.

Visit Indonesia Year 2010

Following the hosting on the island of Lombok in 2009, the event was again hosted in Lombok-Sumbawa on 12–15 October 2010 at Santosa Villas &amp; Resort in Senggigi on the west coast of Lombok. Entering its 16th year, TIME was organised by the Indonesian Tourism Promotion Board (ITPB) and supported by a wide number of tour participants in Indonesia. TIME 2010 was supported by the travel and tourism industry in Indonesia, including the Ministry of Culture &amp; Tourism, the Provincial Government of West Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara Culture &amp; Tourism Office, Lombok Sumbawa Promo, Garuda Indonesia as official airline, other supporting airlines, Indonesia National Air Carriers Association (INACA), Board of Airline Representatives Indonesia (BARINDO), Association of Indonesian Tours &amp; Travel Agencies (ASITA), Indonesia Hotels and Restaurant Association (PHRI), Indonesian Conference and Convention Association (INCCA), Pacto Convex as the event organiser, supported by national and international media. Lombok and Sumbawa in West Nusa Tenggara set a target of wooing one million tourists to visit the islands by 2012.

Wonderful Indonesia (since 2011)

&quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; has been the slogan since January 2011 of an international marketing campaign directed by the Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Tourism to promote tourism. The campaign replaced the previous &quot;Visit Indonesia Year&quot; campaign which had been used since 1991. The &quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; concept highlights Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;wonderful&quot; nature, cultures, people, food, and value for the money. After the campaign was launched, Indonesia reported an increase of foreign visitors; from 7,002,944 in 2010, to 7,649,731 in 2011; and 8,044,462 in 2012.

In late January 2011, Culture and Tourism Minister Jero Wacik announced that &quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; would replace the previous &quot;Visit Indonesia Year&quot; branding used by the nation&#x27;s official tourism promotional campaigns, although the logo of stylised curves Garuda remain. The minister announced that in 2010, foreign tourists visiting Indonesia touched 7 million and made predictions of 7.7 million in 2011. He was reported as describing the new branding as reflecting &quot;the country&#x27;s beautiful nature, unique culture, varied food, hospitable people and price competitiveness. &quot;We expect each tourist will spend around US$1,100 and with an optimistic target of 7.7 million arrivals, we will get $8.3 billion,&quot; from this. The Culture and Tourism Minister added that 50 per cent of the revenue would be generated from about 600 meetings, conventions and exhibitions that were expected to take place in various places throughout the country 2011. He further added in the announcements of January 2011 that his ministry would be promoting the country&#x27;s attractions under the eco-cultural banner.

Pesona Indonesia (since 2014)
In December 2014, the new Minister of Tourism, Arief Yahya launched the new brand &quot;Pesona Indonesia&quot; to target the domestic tourism market. Both &quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; and &quot;Pesona Indonesia&quot; have the same Garuda logo. The minister hopes that both brands will be a single tourism identity for Indonesia.

2016
For most of the time, Indonesian tourism relies heavily on the charm of Bali as a drawing force to attract tourists. As a result, most foreign visitors are drawn and concentrated only in Bali, which already has quite well-developed tourism culture and infrastructure. To distribute the wealth of tourism and generate tourism-related economic opportunities among Indonesian provinces, the tourism authority launched a program to create and add new centres of attraction as an alternative for Bali.

In mid-2016, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism launched a new program named &quot;10 Priority Tourism Destinations (Indonesian: &quot;10 Destinasi Wisata Prioritas&quot;)&quot; dubbed as &quot;the new Bali&quot;. The ten destinations are Borobudur Temple, Lake Toba, Mount Bromo, Komodo National Park, Kepulauan Seribu, Mandalika, Wakatobi Islands, Tanjung Kelayang beach, Tanjung Lesung beach, and Morotai island.

The efforts among others by creating and improving tourism infrastructure facilities including hotels, homestays, restaurants, handicraft and souvenir art markets, also improving interconnection into these regions by improving and constructing new airports. However, in practice by 2017 among these 10 priorities, only 4 of them that kick-off and received full government attention and supports; they are Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Borobudur in Central Java, Labuan Bajo as the gate into Komodo National park, and Mandalika in Lombok.

== Challenges to the tourism industry ==
=== Terrorism ===
Although Indonesia had suffered terrorist attacks back in the 1980s, it was not until 2000s that the attacks have become more disturbingly organized. The first major terrorist attack in Indonesia was 2002 Bali bombing. This was a major blow to Indonesia&#x27;s tourism industry. A series of travel warnings were issued by several countries. After the attack, the rate of tourism in Bali decreased by 32%.

After this 2002 attack, the following three years also suffered three major terrorist bombings: the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing, the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, and a second bombing in Bali. Fortunately in 2008, no major terrorist attack occurred since 2005, and the United States Government lifted its warning against travel to Indonesia. In 2006, 227,000 Australians visited Indonesia, and in 2007, this tourist rate continued to rise with a recorded 314,000 tourists entering Indonesia.

In 2008, the US government lifted their travel warning on Indonesia.

By 2016, the terrorist threat was renewed and reactivated by the outbreak of ISIS-affiliated sleeper cells in the region. In 2016, Jakarta suffered terrorist attack. And by 2018, numbers of terrorist attacks erupted in Surabaya and Pekanbaru.

=== Unconducive policies ===

Most of the major tourist destinations in Indonesia, especially Bali, Yogyakarta, Batam, Bandung and Jakarta, have a rather relaxed modern cosmopolitan social outlook, which is quite conducive for the tourism industry. However, certain regional provinces might not have that kind of luxury and tend to be conservative. In addition to national laws, certain Indonesian provinces have applied regional autonomous laws, some of them based on Islamic sharia law, such as Aceh province. Extra caution must be demonstrated by visitors to Aceh since the province has rather strict Islamic-based law, enforced by Islamic religious police, called the Wilayatul Hisbah in Indonesia.

Thus, some certain normally private matters, such as beach clothing (esp, bikini), modesty issue, party and the consumption of alcohol, to a display of affections between a couple, are discouraged and frowned upon, and might led to a legal problem. Carefulness and discretion are required, especially for unmarried couple and LGBT travellers.

The legal restriction against alcohol, pushed forward by Islamist parties and organizations in the country, is also harming tourism and service sector. As a result, the alcohol tax in Indonesia is among the highest in the world, which caused an unusually high price for alcoholic beverages. This policy is quite harmful to bar, club and restaurant industry in Indonesia.

Another unconducive policy is a rather strict policy on nightlife; local authority sometimes launched a raid on clubs, karaoke and discothèque in a pretext to curb down drugs and substance abuse in these places, which might be inconvenient for visitors. It was reported in April 2017 that the Indonesian government authorities arrested 32 foreign nationals for failing to show proper ID during a raid on an entertainment hub in Batam on 23 April 2017. Yudi Kurnain, a Batam Legislative Council member had condemned the raid, saying that it might discourage tourism in the island. He was quoted as saying, &quot;They should humanely conduct immigration checks, not through such repressive actions&quot;.

Since 2016, anti-LGBT sentiments are on the rise in the country, such as homophobia, hate crimes, raids, criminalization and harassment against LGBT locals and foreigners. The government&#x27;s failure to curb Islamist attacks on LGBT people might damage the tourism sector and real estate development.

=== Regional conflicts ===
Another major threat to the tourism industry are sectarian and separatist conflicts in certain provinces of Indonesia. Decades of separatism-related violence in Aceh ended in 2005 with the signing of a peace agreement between the Indonesian Government and the Free Aceh Movement. Currently, Aceh is trying to develop its tourism sector, although they still have problems regarding unconducive policies such as strict enforcement of sharia law that may harm tourism development in the province.

While the tourism industry in Maluku and Central Sulawesi, which have suffered in recent years from serious sectarian conflicts, are currently recovering.

Papua on the other hand, is still affected by Papuan separatism, a small scale regional conflict. The government and military has been accused of a &quot;slow genocide&quot; against native inhabitant, through transmigration from other densely populated Indonesian provinces that alter the demographic balance in the province. The government and military also has been accused for suppressing free speech in West Papua, after an expulsion of foreign journalists.

=== Environmental issues ===
Environmental issues also pose some problems in the Indonesian tourism sector: especially for nature conservation, marine, forest and national park-related tourism. Problems include deforestation, haze hazard caused by slash-and-burn practice that disrupts air transportation and health, also plastic garbage that pollutes marine life.

During the tropical dry season in 2015, Indonesia and its neighbours were hit by a massive haze, caused by slash and burn practice to clear the land in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). Riau suffered the worst, as the haze disrupted air transportation and caused a health hazard.

In March 2018, a diver shows footage of a popular diving site polluted with floating plastic garbage in Manta Point, Nusa Penida, around 20 kilometres off the coast of Bali. Bali sits in the middle of the Indonesian throughflow, a current that streams from the Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean through the string of straits of the Indonesian archipelago. This means that plastic waste could either be local or be brought in from as far away as the Pacific Ocean; either from within Indonesia, from neighbouring Malaysia and Philippines, or from faraway Asia-Pacific regions, carried away by sea currents.

=== Health issues ===

An outbreak of bird flu throughout the country has affected the numbers of foreign visitors. As of 2006, the outbreak had killed at least 46 people since 2005, making Indonesia the country with the highest death toll from the recent epidemic. However, since the disease has not yet been proven to mutate into a form that can transfer from human to human, the US embassy, for example, has not yet issued a travel warning regarding the outbreak.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia closed its borders to all travellers from China. This move has impacted the Indonesian tourism since Chinese travellers are the second-biggest foreign visitors to the country. The government is planning to spend $477 million in the form of tax cuts, discounts, and others to reduce the slump in the tourism sector. Foreign tourist arrivals at 3 (three) big gates from 26 main entrances in April 2020 compared to April 2019, namely: Ngurah Rai decreased by -99.94%; Soekarno-Hatta experienced a decrease of -99.79%, and Batam decreased by -99.27%. In March 2020, The Indonesian government has decided that Visa Free Arrival (BVK), Visa on Arrival and the Diplomatic / Free Service Visa policy are suspended for 1 month.

== Guide books ==

Guide books and travel accounts with details of the country and people have had a long history – some books from the 19th century and early 20th-century being classics with a description of places that were perceived as &quot;things to see&quot;. Both private authors and government publications (such as the 1920s &quot;Come to Java&quot; books produced in Batavia by the government tourist bureau of the time) have been made each decade through to the present.

There were restrictions to tourism during World War II and the mid-to-late 1960s – other than those two periods – travel accounts and guide books have been produced regularly. James Rush&#x27;s and Adrian Vickers&#x27; texts mentioned below are excellent introductions to the range of writing that has been created.

The most popular guide book on Indonesia in English from the 1970s to the 1990s was Bill Dalton&#x27;s &quot;Indonesia Handbook&quot;, while from the 1990s onward, the Lonely Planet&#x27;s &quot;Indonesia&quot; went to its tenth edition in 2010. Many other guide books have been produced in English and other languages.

Major international newspapers regularly have travel sections and stories about Indonesia. The journalists of tourism in Indonesia joined in the Indonesian Tourism Journalist Association (ITJA), Indonesian journalists active enough to write a variety of tourism information about the uniqueness found in this country.

<text>Halcyon is an unincorporated community of about 125 acres (50 ha) in San Luis Obispo County, California, United States, just south of Arroyo Grande. It was founded in 1903 as a Theosophical intentional community and is the home and headquarters of a religious organization, The Temple of the People (not to be confused with Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple). The Temple group was founded in 1898.

== History ==
Halcyon is registered as an historical site both federally and in the state of California. It contains a community established by a group of Theosophists in the early 1900s, who built a Temple and surrounding buildings. The Temple of the People was founded in Syracuse, New York, in 1898 by William Dower and Francia LaDue, members of the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society. It was moved to Halcyon in 1903. Dower, who was a medical doctor, and LaDue founded the Halcyon Hotel and Sanatorium, where all manner of addiction and nervous ailments as well as tuberculosis were treated and which remained open until 1949. Other members of the Temple followed Dower and La-due to Halcyon from Syracuse, and made their living through farming, poultry, and handicrafts.

Land continued to be acquired by the Temple, whose holdings were at one time much more extensive than present-day Halcyon. A town plan was laid out by the Temple Home Association, which subdivided a portion and sold or leased out home sites. A print shop was established to produce a monthly magazine (which is still published), the &quot;Artisan&quot;, as well as other Theosophical literature. A general store and post office opened in 1908.

LaDue, who was known in her official capacity as &quot;Blue Star&quot;, led the Temple as its first Guardian in Chief until her death in 1922. The Blue Star Memorial Temple building, designed by architect Theodore Eisen of Los Angeles, was constructed in 1923 and named in honor of LaDue. Dower served as the second Guardian until his death in 1937. Pearl Dower was the third Guardian until her death in 1968; during her tenure the William Quan Judge Library was established. Harold Forgostein was the fourth Guardian until his death in 1990. Eleanor Shumway has been the Guardian since that time.

Notable people involved with Halcyon and the Temple include composer and pianist Henry Cowell (see also &quot;The Tides of Manaunaun&quot;), Irish poet and fiction writer Ella Young, and mystic poet and writer John Varian (1863–1931). Varian&#x27;s sons, Russell (1898–1959) and Sigurd (1901–1961), who spent part of their childhood in Halcyon, invented the klystron, an important microwave amplifier tube, and founded the Varian electronics empire.

Cethil Mallory, member and building contractor, worked on many of the single-family homes in Halcyon with the help of his three sons, John, David, and Roland. They helped to rebuild the Halcyon General Store and post office when it was moved one half block south.
Halcyon today contains fifty-two single-family homes, of which thirty are owned by the Temple, as well as several small buildings used by the Temple, and just over one hundred residents. Almost all residents earn their living outside the community.

The Temple continues to function today as a small, but international, theosophical society with headquarters at Halcyon. Weekly services at Halcyon are held on Sundays in the Blue Star Memorial Temple building, as well as a fifteen-minute healing service held there every day at noon. Classes occur twice weekly currently online.

<text>Evans &amp; Sutherland is an American computer graphics firm founded in 1968 by David Evans and Ivan Sutherland. Its current products are used in digital projection environments like planetariums. Its simulation business, which it sold to Rockwell Collins, sold products that were used primarily by the military and large industrial firms for training and simulation.

==History==

The company was founded in 1968 by David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland, professors in the Computer Science Department at the University of Utah. who were pioneers in computer graphics technology. They formed the company to produce hardware to run the systems being developed in the university, working from an abandoned barracks on the university grounds. The company was later housed in the University of Utah Research Park. Most of the employees were active or former students, and included Jim Clark, who started Silicon Graphics, Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, and John Warnock, founder of Adobe.

In the early 1970s they purchased General Electric&#x27;s flight simulator division and formed a partnership with Rediffusion Simulation, a UK-based flight simulator company, to design and build digital flight simulators. For the next three decades this was E&amp;S&#x27;s primary market, delivering display systems with enough brightness to light up a simulator cockpit to daytime light levels. These simulators were used for training in in-flight refueling, carrier landing, AWACS, and B52.

Later in the 1970s the company expanded their line of simulation systems, first building a five-projector graphics system to simulate a ship steaming into New York Harbor and through its surroundings. This graphics system was installed on the mock-up of a ship&#x27;s bridge and used to train ship&#x27;s pilots how to navigate into and out of New York Harbor. The project, called CAORF (Computer Aided Operations Research Facility), was built for the US Maritime Academy. The project paved the way for other visual simulation systems including a NASA Space Shuttle manipulator arm, EVS, submarine periscope and space station docking simulators.

Starting in 1969, E&amp;S produced the LDS-1 (Line Drawing System-1), and later the &quot;Picture System&quot; 1, 2 and PS300 series. These unique &quot;calligraphic&quot; (analog vector drawing) color displays had depth cueing and could draw large wireframe models and manipulate (rotate, shift, zoom) them in real time. They were used both in chemistry by pharmaceutical companies to visualize large molecules such as enzymes or polynucleotides, and by aerospace companies, such as Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and others, to design aircraft.

The Evans &amp; Sutherland Shaded Picture System was introduced in 1973, and was the first commercially available product capable of producing real-time, shaded hidden-line 3D graphics. It was extremely expensive and could only produce black-and-white images at a resolution of 256x256.

The end of the Picture System line came in the late 1980s, when raster devices on workstations could render anti-aliased lines faster.

In 1978 the company went public with a listing on NASDAQ.

In the 1980s E&amp;S added a Digital Theater division, supplying all-digital projectors to create immersive mass-audience experiences at planetariums, visitor attractions and similar education and entertainment venues. Digital Theater grew to become a major arm of E&amp;S commercial activity with hundreds of Digistar 1 and 2 systems installed around the world, such as at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.

In the mid-1980s Evans &amp; Sutherland introduced a geometric modeling system called CDRS, that provided high quality surface design capabilities together with a photo-realistic rendering system. CDRS was sold to many well known manufacturers including both Ford &amp; Chrysler. CDRS was acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation in 1995.

For a brief period between 1986 and 1989 E&amp;S was also a supercomputer vendor, but their ES-1 was released just as the supercomputer market was drying up in the post-Cold War military wind-down. Only a handful of machines were built, most broken up for scrap. One sample ES-1 is in storage at the Computer History Museum.

During the 1990s E&amp;S tried to expand into several other commercial markets. The Freedom Series graphics engine was developed to work with Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and DEC workstations. 3D Pro technology was developed for the first wave of 3D graphics cards for PCs. Also, the MindSet virtual set system was created to address the needs of the broadcast video market.

In 1993 Evans and Sutherland helped Japanese arcade giant Namco with texture-mapping technology in Namco&#x27;s System 22 arcade board that powered &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;. The help that E&amp;S gave Namco was similar to the help that Martin Marietta gave Sega with the MODEL 2 board that powered Daytona USA and Desert Tank arcade games.

In 1998 Evans and Sutherland acquired AccelGraphics Inc, a manufacturer of computer graphics boards, for $52m.

Since its launch in July 2002, the company&#x27;s Digistar 3 system became the world&#x27;s fastest selling Digital Theater system and is installed in upwards of 120 fulldome venues worldwide.

On May 9, 2006, Evans &amp; Sutherland acquired Spitz Inc, a rival vendor in the planetarium market, giving the combined business the largest base of installed planetaria worldwide and adding in-house projection-dome manufacturing capability to E&amp;S&#x27; offering.

In 2006 Evans and Sutherland sold its simulation business, which for decades was the core of the company, to Rockwell Collins.

On February 10, 2020, Elevate Entertainment (later renamed Cosm) and Evans &amp; Sutherland announced that Elevate would purchase E&amp;S for $1.19 per share in cash in a transaction valued at $14,500,000.

==Use in movies and special effects==
The Evans &amp; Sutherland Picture System (PS2) was used extensively in the 1982 science fiction movie, Tron. The PS2 was a high-resolution vector graphics machine capable of drawing in real time on a CRT screen. Several of the machines were used by special effects production house, Robert Abel and Associates. Technicians at Abel built computer-controlled 35mm cameras which interfaced with the PS2 and recorded the images directly from the CRT screen. Initially, Robert Abel and his staff had found ways to use an Evans &amp; Sutherland flight simulator to present a simple wireframe version of what was to be photographed later by a motion-control camera. They later added colored filters and used multiple exposures to photograph the E&amp;S machine&#x27;s output as final art.

An Evans &amp; Sutherland computer was used in the creation of the Project Genesis simulation sequence in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). The star fields, and the tactical bridge displays on the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; simulator and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; were created by Evans &amp; Sutherland employees and filmed directly from the screen of a prototype Digistar system at company headquarters. This film was one of the first ever to use computer graphics (after &quot;Futureworld&quot; in 1976). Star fields and some of the other shots were reused in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) and later films.

NBC would later use an Evans &amp; Sutherland Picture System for its 1984–1985 promotional campaign &quot;Let&#x27;s All Be There!&quot;, as well as subsequent campaigns, concluding with the 1989–1990 season promotional campaign &quot;Come Home to the Best!&quot;.

<doc id="693146" wikidata="Q1727601" url="?curid=693146" title="Cyclone Gudrun">
<text>Gudrun was a powerful storm which hit Denmark and Sweden on 8 January 2005, and Latvia and Estonia on 9 January 2005. The name Erwin was chosen by the Free University of Berlin, while the storm was named Gudrun by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and was the name used in Sweden. Sustained wind speeds of with wind gusts of were measured in Hanstholm, Denmark – the same strength as a Category 1 hurricane.

The storm caused significant financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees, as more than of trees were blown down in southern Sweden. This resulted in Sweden at the time having the world&#x27;s largest surplus of lumber.

About 415,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were without power for many days and even weeks in some cases, as about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The death toll in Sweden was 7 victims, making it one of the biggest environmental disasters in Swedish history, while four were killed in Denmark and one in Estonia.

==Meteorological history==

On 6 January 2005, a low pressure system developed at a frontal zone south of Newfoundland. It moved into the central North Atlantic and was named &#x27;Erwin&#x27; by the Free University of Berlin. Erwin strengthened rapidly and its pressure at the time of naming was . Erwin moved quickly, and was already moving over Scotland and Northern Ireland on the 8th. In the UK, temperatures were noticeably higher after the passing of Erwin. On the 9th, Erwin had already moved into the Baltic Sea with a minimum central pressure of . Over much of Central and Western Europe, temperatures were very mild. The next day, weakening Erwin was over Western Russia with a pressure of . Erwin began slowing down as it moved into Central Russia. On 13 January, Erwin dissipated over Russia.

==Impact==
===Carlisle and Cumbria flooding===
In the UK, the main impacts of the storm were flooding in Cumbria and Carlisle, where 1,800 homes were flooded in the city.

===Sweden blackout and damage to forests===
Gudrun is one of the strongest storms to impact Sweden in the last 100 years. It caused much damage to forests in Halland the southwestern part of the South Swedish highlands (Småland). Spruces were particularly hit by Gudrun, while other trees with a more steady root system fared better. Damage was also exacerbated by the practice of clearcutting, leaving many trees exposed. Gudrun also caused blackouts and disabled telecommunications infrastructure.

==Aftermath==
===Byholma Wood Stockpile===
The cyclone created the world&#x27;s largest wood stockpile, which Gizmodo lists as containing of wood as of May 2012. In Sweden, the total volume of wood from the trees struck down by the storm was about .

===Political impact in Sweden===
In her dissertation, &quot;Natural Disasters and National Election&quot;, Lina M. Eriksson, PhD, found that the storm played a crucial role in the historic regime shift in the 2006 Swedish general election. The incumbent Social Democratic Party&#x27;s poor crisis response to Gudrun, hitherto the most expensive natural disaster in Swedish history, significantly contributed to the incumbent&#x27;s loss. In a subsequent article in Electoral Studies, it was observed that the deficient storm response still swayed voters in the 2010 and 2014 elections.

<text>Max Berg (17 April 1870 – 22 January 1947) was a German architect and urban planner.

== Biography ==
Berg was born in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in Pomerania, then part of the German Empire. He attended the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (today Technische Universität Berlin), where he was taught by Carl Schäfer who favoured Gothic architecture. Berg was also taught by Franz Adickes (1846–1915), an important urban planner.

In 1909 Berg was appointed senior building official in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), in Silesia. His most notable contribution to architecture is the Jahrhunderthalle (Centennial Hall) built between 1911 and 1913 as part of a series of works commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1813 War of Liberation against Napoleon Bonaparte. The Hall, an important early landmark of European reinforced concrete buildings, survived World War II, and in 2006 was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Other works in Breslau (Wrocław) include the market hall (a huge concrete structure of elliptical arches, but appearing more traditional externally) and a large office building on the SW corner of the Main Market Square.

In 1925, the year he retired from his architectural career for Christian mysticism, Berg moved to Berlin and then to Baden-Baden, where he died in 1947, aged 76.

<text>The National League, officially known as Vanarama National League for sponsorship reasons, is a professional association football league in England. National League is the first division of the National Leagues and step 1 of the NLS and fifth-highest tier overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League and the EFL leagues and is contested by 24 clubs. Through the National League, clubs get promoted to the EFL League Two, one of the divisions of the English Football League. Formerly the Conference National, the league was renamed the National League from the 2015–16 season.

Notable former English Football League clubs that compete in the National League include: Oldham Athletic, Rochdale, York City, Yeovil Town, Hartlepool United and Southend United. The longest tenured team currently competing in the National League is Aldershot Town, who have been competing in the National League since 2013–14.

==History==
The league was formed as the Alliance Premier League in 1979, coming into force for the 1979–80 season. The league drew its clubs from the Northern Premier League and the Southern League.

It greatly improved the quality of football at this lower level, as well as improving the financial status of the top clubs. This was reflected in 1986–87, when the Football League began accepting direct promotion and relegation between the Conference and the bottom division of the Football League, which at that time was known as the Football League Fourth Division and is now EFL League Two. The first team to be promoted by this method was Scarborough, and the first team relegated was Lincoln City, who regained their Football League status a year later as Conference champions.

Since 2002–03, the league has been granted a second promotion place, with a play-off deciding who joins the champions in League Two. Previously, no promotion from the Conference would occur if the winners did not have adequate stadium facilities. If a club wins the division, but does not qualify for promotion, the next highest eligible club will be promoted in its place. If a club finishes in the play-off places but does not have an adequate stadium they will not be able to take part in the play-off competition. In that event such club shall not be replaced and the play-off structure and draw shall be adjusted as necessary by the National League Board on the basis of the remaining clubs&#x27; final league positions.

In 2004–05, the Conference increased its size by adding two lower divisions, the Conference North and Conference South respectively, with the original division being renamed Conference National. For the 2006–07 season, the Conference National expanded from 22 to 24 teams by promoting four teams while relegating two teams and introduced a &quot;four up and four down&quot; system between itself and the Conference North and Conference South.

==Sponsorship==
The league&#x27;s first sponsor was Gola during the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons. When Gola&#x27;s sponsorship ceased, carmaker Vauxhall Motors—then the British subsidiary of General Motors—took over and sponsored the league until the end of the 1997–98 season.

The 1998–99 Conference campaign began without sponsors for the Conference, but just before the end of the season a sponsorship was agreed with Nationwide Building Society. This lasted until the end of the 2006–07 season, after which Blue Square took over. This would also prompt the leagues being renamed, with the Conference National becoming the Blue Square Premier, the Conference North becoming Blue Square North and the Conference South becoming Blue Square South. In April 2010, Blue Square announced a further three-year sponsorship deal. From the start of the 2010–11 season the names were changed slightly, with &quot;Blue Square&quot; becoming &quot;Blue Square Bet&quot;.

In July 2013 the Conference agreed another sponsorship deal with online payment firm Skrill. This lasted for only one year and the following July the Conference announced a brand-new three-year deal with Vanarama, later extended by two more years.

In 2015, the Football Conference was renamed the National League. The top division was also officially renamed the National League and the lower divisions renamed as National League North and National League South. In January 2019 the League signed a three-year deal with Motorama, Vanarama&#x27;s sister company. It was extended to three more years in March 2021.

==Media coverage==
Coverage of this league began in the mid-1990s when cable channels Wire TV, and later L!VE TV, broadcast weekly highlights and live matches. However, the closure of L!VE TV in 1999 saw coverage switch to Sky Sports. In August 2006, Setanta Sports signed a five-year deal with the Conference and Setanta Sports began showing live matches in the 2007–08 season, with 79 live games each season. Included in the deal were the annual play-off matches as well as the Conference League Cup, a cup competition for the three Football Conference divisions. Setanta showed two live matches a week, with one on Thursday evening and one at the weekend.
In Australia the Conference National was broadcast by Setanta Sports Australia. Setanta Sports suffered financial problems and ceased broadcasting in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2009. Sky Sports broadcast the Conference play-off final 2010 at Wembley Stadium.

On 19 August 2010, Premier Sports announced that it bought the live and exclusive UK television rights to 30 matches per season from the Conference Premier for a total of three seasons. The 30 matches selected for broadcast included all five Conference Premier play-offs. The deal with the Football Conference was a revenue sharing arrangement whereby clubs received 50% of revenue from subscriptions, on top of the normal rights fee paid by the broadcaster, once the costs of production were met. The Conference also earned 50% from all internet revenue associated with the deal, which allowed them to retain advertising rights allied to those adverts shown with their matches. During the 2010–11 season, Premier Sports failed to attract enough viewers to its Conference football broadcasts to share any revenue with the clubs beyond the £5,000 broadcast fee paid to home clubs and £1,000 to away clubs.

In July 2013, BT Sport announced a two-year deal to broadcast 30 live games per season including all five play-off matches. In 2015 the National League announced that it renewed a three-year deal with BT Sport.

<doc id="693163" wikidata="Q3280621" url="?curid=693163" title="Head (film)">
<text>Head is a 1968 American satirical musical adventure film written and produced by Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson, directed by Rafelson, starring television rock group the Monkees (Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith) and distributed by Columbia Pictures. A theatrical spin-off of the 1966–68 NBC television show and a swan song (series finale), it started production directly after completion of series production.

During production, one of the working titles for the film was &quot;Changes&quot;, which was later the name of an album by the Monkees. Another working title was &quot;Untitled&quot;. A rough cut of the film was previewed for audiences in Los Angeles in the summer of 1968 under the title &quot;Movee Untitled&quot;.

The film featured Victor Mature as &quot;The Big Victor&quot; and cameo appearances by Nicholson, Teri Garr, Carol Doda, Annette Funicello, Frank Zappa, Sonny Liston, Timothy Carey, Percy Helton and Ray Nitschke. Also appearing on screen in brief non-speaking parts are Dennis Hopper and film choreographer Toni Basil.

==Plot==
&quot;Head&quot; begins at the dedication of a bridge. As a local politician struggles with his microphone during the dedication speech, the &quot;wacky, fun-loving&quot; Monkees (Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Michael Nesmith), suddenly interrupt the ceremony by running through the assembled officials, to the sound of various horns and sirens. The rest of the film shows the events leading up to this.

Earlier, the four have just all kissed the same groupie, who tells them that they were indistinguishable. Throughout the film, they make their way both together and separately through a series of unrelated vignettes, each being a different type of movie (a mystery, a war movie, a western, a desert adventure, etc.).

In each segment, the Monkees try to deal with the fact that they&#x27;re four real people in a real band that makes records for real people, but are also scripted characters in a fake TV band doing nothing except exactly what the director wants them to.

They continually try to prove to themselves that they&#x27;re free and can make any choice they want. But no matter what they try—deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they&#x27;re really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them—they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they&#x27;re in and the director directing it.

While being chased by everyone they&#x27;ve encountered (and disrupted) in the various vignettes, they run onto a bridge, shoving people out of the way. It&#x27;s revealed that they weren&#x27;t being &quot;wacky&quot; at the beginning of the film; they were desperately trying to escape being mere scripted puppets. They jump off the edge and commit suicide, falling a very long way and slamming into the water far below.

However, this, too, was scripted. The film&#x27;s director hauls their soaked bodies away in a huge aquarium while the four stare blankly through the glass, struggling under the water. Laughing, he rolls the aquarium into a slot at the studio warehouse, to be taken out when he wants to use them again in another movie.

==Production==
The plot and peak moments of the film came together at an Ojai, California, resort where the Monkees, Rafelson, and Nicholson brainstormed into a tape recorder, reportedly with the aid of a quantity of marijuana. Jack Nicholson then took the tapes and used them as the basis for his screenplay, which according to Rafelson he structured while under the influence of LSD. When the band learned that they would not be allowed to direct themselves or to receive screenwriting credit, Dolenz, Jones, and Nesmith staged a one-day walkout, leaving Tork the only Monkee on the set the first day. The strike ended after the first day when the studio agreed to a larger percentage share of the film&#x27;s net for the group, but the incident damaged the Monkees&#x27; relationship with Rafelson and Bert Schneider and would effectively end their professional relationship with the producers.

&quot;Head&quot; was filmed from February 19 to May 17, 1968, at Columbia Pictures/Screen Gems Studios at Sunset &amp; Gower, Hollywood, California and at the Columbia Ranch in Burbank, California, as well as various locations in California and elsewhere:

* ribbon cutting ceremony – Gerald Desmond Bridge, Long Beach
* WAR chant cheerleader sequence – Pasadena Rose Bowl, Pasadena
* factory sequence – Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant, Playa Del Rey
* war sequence – Bronson Canyon; some sequences at San Francisco
* desert sequence – Palm Springs, California
* concert sequence – Valley Music Hall, Salt Lake City
* Micky&#x27;s underwater sequence – The Bahamas

The song &quot;Ditty Diego – War Chant&quot; was written by Jack Nicholson and is a parody of the band&#x27;s original Boyce and Hart written TV theme song; its lyrics illustrate the tone of self-parody evident in parts of the film. The final &quot;We&#x27;re here to give you...&quot; is interrupted by a gunshot, with footage of the execution of Viet Cong operative (q.v.) Nguyễn Văn Lém, by Brigadier General and then Chief of National Police Nguyễn Ngọc Loan.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s music included contributions by Carole King and Harry Nilsson. Jack Nicholson compiled the soundtrack album, which approximates the flow of the movie and includes large portions of the dialogue. The film&#x27;s incidental music was composed and conducted by Ken Thorne, who also composed and conducted the incidental music to the Beatles&#x27; second film, &quot;Help!&quot; The film&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Porpoise Song&quot;, appeared at the film&#x27;s start and finish. Bright color filters heighten the visual effect and dreamlike touch of the passages, which include mermaids rescuing member Micky Dolenz in the film&#x27;s start.

Andrew Sandoval, author of &quot;The Monkees: The Day-By-Day Story of the 60s TV Pop Sensation&quot;, commented that, &quot;It has some of their best songs on it and ...the movie&#x27;s musical performances are some of the most cohesive moments in the film.&quot;

The music of the Monkees often featured a rather dark subject matter beneath a superficially bright, uplifting sound. The music of the film takes the darkness and occasional satirical elements of the Monkees&#x27; earlier tunes and makes it far more overt, as in &quot;Ditty Diego&quot; or &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Song&quot;, which has Jones singing an upbeat, Broadway-style number about a boy abandoned by his father. In his 2012 essay on the soundtrack album, academic Peter Mills noted that &quot;on this album the songs are only part of the story, as they were with the Monkees project as a whole: Signals, sounds, and ideas interfere with each other throughout.&quot;

The soundtrack includes:
* &quot;Porpoise Song&quot; (theme) – Gerry Goffin, Carole King
* &quot;Ditty Diego&quot; – Bob Rafelson, Jack Nicholson
* &quot;Circle Sky&quot; – Michael Nesmith
* &quot;Can You Dig It&quot; – Peter Tork
* &quot;As We Go Along&quot; – Carole King, Toni Stern
* &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Song&quot; – Harry Nilsson
* &quot;Long Title: Do I Have to Do This All Over Again?&quot; – Peter Tork
* Excerpts from the film, spliced in random order that is not consecutive to the film itself

==Release==
===Marketing===
Trailers summarized it as a &quot;most extraordinary Horror, adventure, western, comedy, love story, mystery, drama, musical, documentary satire ever made (And that&#x27;s putting it mildly).&quot; There were no pictures of the Monkees on the original poster; only a picture of John Brockman, who did the PR for the film.

&quot;Head&quot; was one of the first films to be advertised with an MPAA rating, with newspaper advertisements in New York daily papers on November 1, 1968, displaying a G rating.

Another part of the promotional campaign was placing &quot;Head&quot; stickers in random places. Rafelson commented that he and Nicholson were arrested at the New York City premiere on October 6 for trying to put a sticker on a police officer&#x27;s helmet as he mounted his horse.

===Reception===
A poor audience response at an August 1968 screening in Los Angeles forced the producers to edit the picture from its original 110-minute length. The 86-minute &quot;Head&quot; premiered in New York City on November 6, 1968; the film later debuted in Hollywood on November 20. It was not a commercial success. This was in part because &quot;Head&quot;, being an antithesis of &quot;The Monkees&quot; sitcom, comprehensively demolished the group&#x27;s carefully groomed public image while the counterculture audience they had been reaching for rejected the Monkees&#x27; efforts out of hand.

The film&#x27;s release also was delayed (partly because of the extensive use of solarization, a then-new technique both laborious and expensive) and underpromoted. The sole television commercial was a confusing minimalist close-up shot of a man&#x27;s head (John Brockman); after 30 seconds the man smiled and the name HEAD appeared on his forehead. This ad was a parody of Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Blow Job&quot;, which only showed a close-up of a man&#x27;s face for an extended period, supposedly receiving &#x27;head&#x27;.

Receiving mixed critical reviews and virtually non-existent box office receipts, the film succeeded in alienating the band&#x27;s teenage fanbase while failing to attract the more adult audience for which they had strived. &quot;Head&quot;″s abysmal reception halted studio plans for any further films with the Monkees. It also corresponded with a steep drop in the group&#x27;s popularity as recording artists; the &quot;Head&quot; soundtrack peaked at No. 45 on the U.S. chart, the first time any Monkees album had not risen to the Top 5. &quot;Porpoise Song&quot; was also the first single to not make the Top 40.

In her scathing review, Renata Adler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;Head&quot; &quot;might be a film to see if you have been smoking grass, or if you like to scream at the Monkees, or if you are interested in what interests drifting heads and hysterical high-school girls.&quot; She added that the group &quot;are most interesting for their lack of similarity to The Beatles. Going through ersatz Beatle songs, and jokes and motions, their complete lack of distinction of any kind ... makes their performance modest and almost brave.&quot;

&quot;Daily Variety&quot; was also harsh, stating that &quot;&quot;Head&quot; is an extension of the ridiculous nonsense served up on the Screen Gems vid series that manufactured the Monkees and lasted two full seasons following the same format and, ostensibly, appealing to the same kind of audience.&quot; But the review applauded Rafelson and Nicholson, saying that they &quot;were wise not to attempt a firm storyline as the Monkees have established themselves in the art of the non sequitur and outrageous action. Giving them material they can handle is good thinking; asking them to achieve something more might have been a disaster.&quot;

Funicello said when she saw the film &quot;it made no more sense to me than it ever had&quot; when she read the script &quot;but it was a challenging, offbeat role and I was happy to play it.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was released on September 18, 1986, on VHS, Beta, and Laserdisc. It was re-released on VHS on January 25, 1995.

It was released on DVD twice: first as an individual release on June 12, 2000, then again on December 14, 2010, as part of the Criterion Collection box set &quot;America Lost and Found: The BBS Story&quot;.

It was released on Blu-ray twice: first on November 23, 2010, as part of &quot;America Lost and Found&quot;, then again on July 8, 2016, as part of &quot;The Monkees: The Complete TV Series&quot; Blu-ray box set.

==Legacy==
&quot;Head&quot; has developed a cult following. Leonard Maltin describes it as &quot;delightfully plotless&quot; and &quot;well worth seeing&quot;, giving the film 3 out of 4 stars. &quot;Head&quot; premiered on television across-the-board as a &quot;CBS Late Movie&quot; on December 30, 1974; the network rebroadcast the film on July 7, 1975. Cable TV took hold in 1981, when &quot;Head&quot; began periodic showings on Spotlight; Cinemax began airing the film in 1984. In the U.K., Channel 4 also aired it on British TV in 1986 and 1991. It was later shown regularly on Starz Cinema and in 2007, Turner Classic Movies featured the film as part of &quot;TCM Underground&quot;, showing the film unedited and in its original aspect ratio. It was released on video and Laserdisc by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video in September 1986, taking advantage of the group&#x27;s 20th Anniversary, again on VHS and DVD by Rhino Entertainment in January 1995 and a third time on Blu-ray and DVD in November and December 2010, respectively, by the Criterion Collection, in a box set with other films from Rafelson. In honor of the Monkees&#x27; 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray on July 8, 2016, with the film and deleted scenes.

When asked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in March 2012 if he thought making &quot;Head&quot; was a mistake, Nesmith responded by saying that &quot;by the time &quot;Head&quot; came out the Monkees were a pariah. There was no confusion about this. We were on the cosine of the line of approbation, from acceptance to rejection...and it was over. &quot;Head&quot; was a swan song. We wrote it with Jack and Bob...and we liked it. It was an authentic representation of a phenomenon we were a part of that was winding down. It was very far from suicide even though it may have looked like that..&quot; A decade earlier, in his commentary for the television series episode &quot;Fairy Tale&quot;, Nesmith called the film the &quot;murder&quot; of the Monkees, an intentional move by Schneider and Rafelson, who had their eyes on bigger goals and felt that the Monkees project was holding them back. Tork echoed a similar statement during the Monkees&#x27; 2001 interview on the VH-1 series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. In 2001, Davy Jones said the Monkees should never have made the movie.

For all of the negative remarks, there have been positive comments, showing Dolenz, whether knowingly or unknowingly, as a fashion trendsetter. In &quot;Straight Outta Cullompton&quot;, author Adam Foley wrote more glowingly, &quot;Julian [Hewings]: &#x27;I was watching &quot;Head&quot;, The Monkees film, and there&#x27;s a bit at the beginning when Micky Dolenz falls from Golden Gate Bridge and he&#x27;s got a pair of slightly flared boot cut jean cords on with a pair of (Adidas) Gazelles, probably the first ones that ever came out and this stripy t-shirt and I thought &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s what I remember when I was a kid – that&#x27;s what everyone used to wear when they went to school.&quot; I just thought &quot;Wow. Yeah. That&#x27;s really speaking to me there and I got the others together&quot; and went &quot;Have a look at this, we&#x27;re going to go out and find these clothes and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to wear&quot;. The look came first before the music&#x27;&quot;.

On November 19, 2014, the film was screened in the United Kingdom for the first time outside London as part of the Leeds International Film Festival. It was introduced by Peter Mills of Leeds Beckett University, author of a book about the Monkees.

The NorthEast ComicCon &amp; Collectibles Extravaganza hosted a 50th anniversary screening of the film at the Regent Theatre (Arlington, Massachusetts), on July 6, 2018. A portion of that screening benefited the Cystic Dreams Fund a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and Dolenz conducted a lengthy question and answer before introducing the film.

<doc id="693167" wikidata="Q3305871" url="?curid=693167" title="Dave Willis">
<text>Dave Willis (born May 1, 1970) is an American voice actor, screenwriter, and producer. He is the co-creator of the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, and &quot;Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell&quot;. Willis also voices the main characters Meatwad and Carl, along with other characters in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. He is also known for voicing Barry Dylan in the FX/FXX series &quot;Archer&quot; and Leto Otel in &quot;&quot;.

==Career==
Willis has worked on various Adult Swim shows that are created primarily by Williams Street, an animation-centered, Atlanta-based production division of Cartoon Network.

Willis got hired at Ghost Planet Industries after giving the producers a very formal letter of recommendation written in crayon, seemingly by a young child. They liked his sense of humor and hired Willis as a writer for &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; in 1995 and then as a writer for &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (&quot;SGC2C&quot; for short) soon after. In early 2000, he helped write and produce the two &quot;Brak Presents the Brak Show Starring Brak&quot; specials.

Willis was working on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; where he first met Matt Maiellaro, with whom Willis would later create many independent short films and eventually create the popular Adult Swim cartoon &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; first premiered unannounced in the early hours of December 30, 2000 and later officially debuted on Adult Swim in the Fall of 2001. In 2005, he co-created the show &quot;Squidbillies&quot;. His works mostly fall into the genre of surreal humour.

In 2010, Willis created &quot;Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge&quot;, a new television pilot for Adult Swim. The pilot aired on March 29, 2010, and was not picked up for a full series. In 2011, Willis co-wrote &quot;New Kidney in Town&quot;, an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Willis was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, and was raised mostly in Conyers, Georgia. He graduated from Wake Forest University and was station manager at Wake Radio. He resides in Atlanta with his wife and two children, Max and Sadie.

<doc id="693170" wikidata="Q6647963" url="?curid=693170" title="Lithium orotate">
<text>Lithium orotate (C5H3LiN2O4) is a salt of orotic acid and lithium. It is available as the monohydrate, LiC5H3N2O4·H2O. In this compound, lithium is non-covalently bound to an orotate ion, rather than to a carbonate or other ion, and like other salts, dissolves in solution to produce free lithium ions. It is marketed as a dietary supplement, though it has been researched minimally between 1973–1986 to treat certain medical conditions, such as alcoholism and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

While lithium orotate is capable of providing lithium to the body, like lithium carbonate and other lithium salts, there are no systematic reviews supporting the efficacy of lithium orotate and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any medical condition.

==Effectiveness==
In 1973, Hans Nieper reported that lithium orotate contained 3.83 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg and lithium carbonate contained 18.8 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg. Nieper went on to claim that lithium did not dissolve from the orotate carrier until it passed through the blood–brain barrier; however, a 1976 study documented that lithium concentrations within the brains of rats were not statistically different between equivalent dosages of lithium from lithium orotate, lithium carbonate, or lithium chloride. However, another study in 1978 study showed that eight hours after intraperitoneal injections brain lithium concentrations of rats were significantly greater after lithium orotate than after lithium carbonate. While little serum lithium remained at 24 h after injection of 2·0 m equiv kg−1 lithium carbonate, two‐thirds of the 2 h serum lithium concentration was present 24 h after lithium orotate. Furthermore, the 24 h brain concentration of lithium after lithium orotate was approximately three times greater than that after lithium carbonate. These data suggest the possibility that lower doses of lithium orotate than lithium carbonate may achieve therapeutic brain lithium concentrations and relatively stable serum concentrations. A year later, Smith and Schou repeated the experiment at a higher dose (2 mM Li+) and found that the higher concentrations in the brain could be possibly accounted for by decreased renal function in rats treated with lithium orotate. The proponents of lithium orotate have since criticized the results by citing the fact that the dose of lithium orotate used in the study was in the toxic range. In 2022, Pacholko redid the experiment and showed lithium orotate to have a safer kidney profile than lithium carbonate, it also showed that both had an increased TSH only in females, but the increase was lower in the orotate group.

The pharmacokinetics of lithium orotate in human brains is poorly documented, and there is no known mechanism by which orotate ions could alter the pharmacokinetics of dissociated lithium ions, however, lithium intake appears to be effective even at low doses, and this may account for lithium orotate&#x27;s claimed effectiveness.

The reason why lithium orotate is poorly studied as a medication compared to lithium carbonate is concerns raised in 1979 regarding the potential amplified renal toxicity of lithium orotate in comparison to lithium carbonate. These concerns were likely based on the results of the use of excessively high concentrations of lithium orotate in the studies. As a result of these concerns, the clinical application and research of lithium orotate were halted for decades since the 1980s. Still, interest in lithium orotate has been rekindled, and research into its use as medication was resumed in the 2010s. The renewed interest is largely due to its purported ability to achieve higher serum and brain lithium-ion (Li+) concentrations than those observed from equivalent doses of lithium carbonate, a claim first made in 1978.

==Safety==
Preliminary studies seem to indicate that lithium orotate is safe if taken at lower dosages; a 6 month alcoholism cessation study led to only minor adverse effects in 8 out of 42 patients. However, the lack of safety studies and the OTC status raises concerns. Attention to it was specially raised in medical literature after a case report of an 18 year old woman with mild, acute lithium toxicity after taking an overdose (2.16 grams) of a lithium orotate supplement. She was discharged after treatment. Lithium blood levels 90 minutes after ingestion reached 0.31 mEq/L, and an hour later after treatment, 0.40 mEq/L, levels below the serum toxicity level of 1.5 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). 

Orotic acid can be mutagenic in very high doses of 50 mg/kg in mammalian somatic cells. It is also mutagenic for bacteria and yeast. Although lithium orotate was not shown to be genotoxic, short and long term studies must be performed to guarantee public safety.

<doc id="693185" wikidata="Q1945137" url="?curid=693185" title="Monotonicity of entailment">
<text>Monotonicity of entailment is a property of many logical systems such that if a sentence follows deductively from a given set of sentences then it also follows deductively from any superset of those sentences. A corollary is that if a given argument is deductively valid, it cannot become invalid by the addition of extra premises.

Logical systems with this property are called monotonic logics in order to differentiate them from non-monotonic logics. Classical logic and intuitionistic logic are examples of monotonic logics. 

==Weakening rule==

Monotonicity may be stated formally as a rule called weakening, or sometimes thinning. A system is monotonic if and only if the rule is admissible. 
The weakening rule may be expressed as a natural deduction sequent: 
:formula_1
This can be read as saying that if, on the basis of a set of assumptions formula_2, one can prove C, then by adding an assumption A, one can still prove C. 

== Example ==

The following argument is valid: &quot;All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore Socrates is mortal.&quot; This can be weakened by adding a premise: &quot;All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Cows produce milk. Therefore Socrates is mortal.&quot; By the property of monotonicity, the argument remains valid with the additional premise, even though the premise is irrelevant to the conclusion. 

==Non-monotonic logics==

In most logics, weakening is either an inference rule or a metatheorem if the logic doesn&#x27;t have an explicit rule. Notable exceptions are:

* Relevance logic, where every premise is necessary for the conclusion.
* Linear logic, which lacks monotonicity and idempotency of entailment.

* Contraction
* Exchange rule
* Substructural logic
* No-cloning theorem

<text>Noble Automotive Ltd, more commonly known simply as Noble, is an English sports car manufacturer based in Leicester. Noble Automotive Ltd. was established in 1999 by Lee Noble in Leeds, West Yorkshire, for producing high-speed sports cars with a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lee Noble was the chief designer and part owner of Noble. The company was sold in August 2006. He left the company in February 2008 and shortly after announced his new venture, Fenix Automotive in 2009.
Noble is a low-production English sports car company, its past products include the M12 GTO, M12 GTO-3, M12 GTO-3R and Noble M400. The M12 GTO-3R and M400 share chassis and body, but have minor differences in engines and suspensions. The M15 has a new space frame chassis. The body and chassis of the Noble is built by Hi-Tech Automotive in Port Elizabeth, South Africa alongside Superformance cars. Once the body shell is completed, it is sent to the Noble factory where the engines, transmissions, etc. are added.
In 2009 Noble released the M600 with available from its 4.4-litre V8 Volvo derived twin turbocharged engine with a Graziano 6 speed manual gearbox.

Only 220 Noble GTO-3Rs and M400s were exported to the US. They are the only Nobles available to the American market. The US distribution rights to the M12s and M400s were sold in February 2007 to 1G Racing from Ohio. Due to high demand of these cars, 1G released its own copy, named Rossion Q1.

==Noble M10 (1999–2000)==
The &quot;Noble M10&quot; is a two-door, two seater model built in convertible form only. It is powered by a naturally aspirated (i.e., no turbo charger) 2.5-litre engine. It was introduced in 1999, but is no longer in production, having been replaced by the M12. Only a few were ever made, as customers moved deposits onto the M12 as soon as its credentials were announced.

==Noble M12 (2000–2008)==

Like the &quot;Noble M10&quot;, the &quot;Noble M12&quot; is a two-door, two-seater model, originally planned both as a coupe and as a convertible. All M12s have been powered by specially tuned turbocharged Ford Duratec V6 engines.

The M12 has a full steel roll cage, steel frame, and fibre glass composite clam shell body parts. These cars are extremely lightweight and stiff. Although track derived, the M12 performs well on both road and track. The coupe evolved through four variants, with the M400 being the ultimate version of the M12, followed by the GTO-3R.

* Noble M12 GTO – 2.5L bi-turbo 
* Noble M12 GTO-3 – 3.0L bi-turbo 
* Noble M12 GTO-3R – 3.0L bi-turbo 

0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.7 seconds was published in the official brochure of the M12 GTO-3R, Road and Track indicated a 0–60 mph performance of 3.3 seconds, but subsequently listed it as 3.5 seconds. Its top speed is listed as 170 mph. Lateral Gs are reported in excess of 1.2.

==Noble M400 (2004-2007)==
The M400 is the track variant of the M12. Its power-to-weight ratio is over per ton, and is the figure from which its model name derives. It has and has been reported to do 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in as little as 2.97 seconds. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; (March 2007) achieved a 0–60 mph time of 3.3 seconds and a 0–100 mph time of 7.52 seconds. Although often listed as 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds, the M400 generally comes in at 3.2 seconds according to various publications and generally listed amongst the fastest accelerating cars. Noble indicates only that the car is capable of achieving 0–60 mph in under 4 seconds. Its top speed is listed as 185 mph (300 km/h). A top speed of has been achieved by Noble&#x27;s former press officer. Lateral Gs are reported in excess of 1.2. It has both a 3-point seatbelt and a 5-point harness.

The most notable differences from the M12 are the use of forged pistons, Universal Turbos Ltd Supplied Garrett T28 turbos, a front anti-roll bar, stiffer springs, different shocks, Pirelli P Zero tyres, a smoother gear shifter, and a slightly narrower central tunnel as the driver now sits a bit more central than previous models. Exterior differences remain subtle. The colour scheme tends to incorporate anthracite (Gris) wheels, rear wing supports and wing ends but some examples maintain silver wheels and supports. The front splitter is now removed (Although many owners opt to have this put on). The main change is the addition of side pods to enhance air into the system and to create a visual impact. Air conditioning is now an £1,995 option and adds to the weight. The interior has an added oil gauge that resides next to the boost one. Additionally the Sparco Alcantara seats and finishings differ to the other Noble&#x27;s (Alcantara is one third the weight of leather). The Noble M400 won the car of the year award in 2005 for one publication. The M400 is designed to be an outstanding track car that is also pleasant to drive on the road. With just 75 examples made (UK/Europe) this version is sought after and rare.

==Noble M14 (Prototype)==
The Noble M14 debuted at the 2004 British International Motor Show and generated significant interest in the motoring press. It was planned to compete with the Porsche 911 Turbo and Ferrari F430. It was based on the chassis of the M12, with only minor modifications. It had a new body and a more up market interior. Following the debut of the car Lee Noble decided that the car was insufficiently different from the M12/M400 to justify the price increase despite having taken a number of deposits. Noble instead developed a brand new car, the M15, developing further from the M12 and M14, although the cars have few common components.

==Noble M15 (2006-2011)==
Production of the M15 was planned to begin in early 2006, but has not taken place. The Noble M15 was intended to appeal to a far broader market and compete directly with the Porsche 911 Turbo and Ferrari F430. As a result, the Noble M15 was expected to have a number of features not previously found on Nobles such as satnav, traction control, electric windows and ABS. The company issued a press release about the M15, stating that the M15 will be produced after the introduction of the M600. The M15 of the future will be different than the car shown in 2006.

Despite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars press releases stated that Noble expected the M15 to be significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track. It is able to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 3.3 seconds and has a top speed of 185 mph (298 km/h).

The car was based on a brand new platform with a longitudinally mounted engine connected to a bespoke gearbox created by Graziano. The double wishbone suspension is a development of the system mounted on the M400. Mounting the engine longitudinally allowed the designer to increase cooling flow to the engine which allows the 3.0L twin turbo V6 to produce . The engine was designed to meet emissions regulations and the new steel/aluminium space frame was designed with a view to passing crash test regulations around the world. The M15 was planned to be the first Noble to gain European and US Type Approval.

According to founder Lee Noble, &quot;I wanted to produce a supercar people could use every day. It was time for Noble to take a big step up in terms of refinement, practicality and style.&quot;

The M15 appeared in &quot;Top Gear&quot; and presenter Richard Hammond was very impressed. It was a lot quicker around the Top Gear track than the old Noble. According to Richard this has to do with the new, stronger gearbox which enables Noble to allow more boost and let the same engine produce more power. The Stig managed a lap time of 1:22.5 which is currently 50th on the power lap board.

==Noble M600 (2010-2018)==

In 2010, Noble began sales production of the M600. It has a Volvo twin-turbocharged V8 engine (producing 650 bhp, 485 kW, 659 PS), a carbon fibre body shell, and a 6-speed Graziano gear box. It competes in the same category as the Ferrari F430. The M600 can accelerate from 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.5 seconds and requires only another 4 seconds to achieve . It has over 1G of grip on the skid pad. The brake discs in the Noble M600 are steel. The Noble comes with no ABS or ASM. It does have TCS as standard, although this can be totally disabled via a fighter jet style missile switch. The Noble M600 has a high reputation as a pure driver&#x27;s car. 
Noble publicly tested an M600 prototype 2 in the US, comparing its performance with a Porsche Carrera GT and Ferrari Enzo. This prototype was detuned to 500 bhp (373 kW; 507 PS).
According to UK enthusiast website ATFULLCHAT Noble Automotive have not ignored the possibility of building an M600 roadster. On 21 June 2012 the website published a rendering of an M600 drophead that was commissioned internally by Noble Automotive, although company MD Peter Boutwood is quoted as stating there are no plans at present to produce such a machine. However, in 2016 Matt Prior of Autocar tested the cabriolet version now called the M600 Speedster. Giving it 4 stars even though it was still in the development stages. Evo also reviewed the Speedster claiming &quot;Whereas the Lamborghini Huracán and Aventador feels compromised by having its roof sliced away, the Speedster is close to undamaged&quot;.

Initial projected production would be limited to fifty cars and at least thirty were produced. M600 production stopped in 2018.
