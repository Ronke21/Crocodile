<text>Terminal illness or end-stage disease is a disease that cannot be cured or adequately treated and is expected to result in the death of the patient. This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as cancer, rather than fatal injury. In popular use, it indicates a disease that will progress until death with near absolute certainty, regardless of treatment. A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient, terminally ill or simply as being terminal. There is no standardized life expectancy for a patient to be considered terminal, although it is generally months or less. An illness which is lifelong but not fatal is called a &quot;chronic condition&quot;.

Terminal patients have options for disease management after diagnosis. Examples include caregiving, continued treatment, palliative and hospice care, and physician-assisted suicide. Decisions regarding management are made by the patient and their family, although medical professionals may offer recommendations of services available to terminal patients.

Lifestyle after diagnosis varies depending on management decisions and the nature of the disease, and there may be restrictions depending on the condition of the patient. Terminal patients may experience depression or anxiety associated with impending death, and family and caregivers may struggle with psychological burdens. Psychotherapeutic interventions may alleviate some of these burdens, and is often incorporated into palliative care.

When terminal patients are aware of their impending deaths, they have time to prepare for care, such as advance directives and living wills, which have been shown to improve end-of-life care. While death cannot be avoided, patients can strive to die a death seen as good. However, many healthcare providers are uncomfortable telling people or their families that they are dying. To avoid uncomfortable conversations, they will withhold information and evade questions.

== Definition ==
Accurately identifying the start of terminal status is important because it usually occasions a review of treatment goals. Although there is no single official definition, there are four typical characteristics for determining whether a person has a terminal illness:

* The person is expected to die from this illness (i.e., not from old age).
* The illness cannot be cured (or it is medically unlikely) and is expected to get worse.
* The illness has reached an advanced stage.
* The statistically likely remaining lifespan is measured in weeks or months, rather than years or decades. For example, four different US federal laws define the maximum expected lifespan in four different ways: no more than six months, nine months, 12 months, or 24 months.
When the remaining lifespan is expected to be days and the physical process of dying has begun, the term &quot;active dying&quot; may be used instead. 

== Communicating terminal status ==
Most terminally ill people are not distressed by being told that they are likely to die sooner rather than later, and they usually value knowing whether their realistic lifespan is likely to be &quot;weeks&quot;, &quot;months&quot;, or &quot;years&quot;, even if more specific estimates are unavailable. However, many healthcare providers avoid telling them this because the healthcare providers are uncomfortable with death or perceive it as a professional failure. To avoid admitting that the person will inevitably die from an incurable condition, they may withhold information or, if pressed, give overly optimistic answers. For example, if the typical person in that situation usually lives for two to six months, they may say only the larger number. They may rationalize the inflated claim by thinking of hopeful possibilities, such as an unproven treatment (which might shorten the person&#x27;s life even further) being attempted, or because they know that life expectancy is an imperfect estimate and could be both shorter or longer than expected.

They may feel pressure from family members to give pleasant news or to preserve the false appearance of hope. They often want to avoid the emotional outbursts that are associated with people understanding the medical situation accurately. For example, they will use death-denying language such as &quot;She has a life-limiting diagnosis&quot; – a term that makes the inevitable death seem less inevitable – rather than bluntly saying &quot;No matter what we do, your daughter is almost certainly going to die from this cancer, probably within the next few months.&quot;

== Management ==

By definition, there is not a cure or adequate treatment for terminal illnesses. However, some kinds of medical treatments may be appropriate anyway, such as treatment to reduce pain or ease breathing.

Some terminally ill patients stop all debilitating treatments to reduce unwanted side effects. Others continue aggressive treatment in the hope of an unexpected success. Still others reject conventional medical treatment and pursue unproven treatments such as radical dietary modifications. Patients&#x27; choices about different treatments may change over time. People who pursue aggressive treatment usually do not understand that their illness has reached a terminal stage, and they are pursuing treatment because they do not understand it to be futile.

Palliative care is normally offered to terminally ill patients, regardless of their overall disease management style, if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life. Hospice care, which can be provided at home or in a long-term care facility, additionally provides emotional and spiritual support for the patient and loved ones. Some complementary approaches, such as relaxation therapy, massage, and acupuncture may relieve some symptoms and other causes of suffering.

=== Caregiving ===
Terminal patients often need a caregiver, who could be a nurse, licensed practical nurse or a family member. Caregivers can help patients receive medications to reduce pain and control symptoms of nausea or vomiting. They can also assist the individual with daily living activities and movement. Caregivers provide assistance with food and psychological support and ensure that the individual is comfortable.

The patient&#x27;s family may have questions and most caregivers can provide information to help ease the mind. Doctors generally do not provide estimates for fear of instilling false hopes or obliterate an individual&#x27;s hope.

In most cases, the caregiver works along with physicians and follows professional instructions. Caregivers may call the physician or a nurse if the individual:
* experiences excessive pain.
* is in distress or having difficulty breathing.
* has difficulty passing urine or is constipated.
* has fallen and appears hurt.
* is depressed and wants to harm themselves.
* refuses to take prescribed medications, raising ethical concerns best addressed by a person with more extensive formal training.
* or if the caregiver does not know how to handle the situation.

Most caregivers become the patient&#x27;s listeners and let the individual express fears and concerns without judgment. Caregivers reassure the patient and honor all advance directives. Caregivers respect the individual&#x27;s need for privacy and usually hold all information confidential.

=== Palliative care ===
Palliative care focuses on addressing patients&#x27; needs after disease diagnosis. While palliative care is not disease treatment, it addresses patients&#x27; physical needs, such as pain management, offers emotional support, caring for the patient psychologically and spiritually, and helps patients build support systems that can help them get through difficult times. Palliative care can also help patients make decisions and come to understand what they want regarding their treatment goals and quality of life.

Palliative care is an attempt to improve patients&#x27; quality-of-life and comfort, and also provide support for family members and carers. Additionally, it lowers hospital admissions costs. However, needs for palliative care are often unmet whether due to lack of government support and also possible stigma associated with palliative care. For these reasons, the World Health Assembly recommends development of palliative care in health care systems.

Palliative care and hospice care are often confused, and they have similar goals. However, hospice care is specifically for terminal patients while palliative care is more general and offered to patients who are not necessarily terminal.

=== Hospice care ===
While hospitals focus on treating the disease, hospices focus on improving patient quality-of-life until death. Hospice patients are able to live at peace away from a hospital setting; they may live at home with a hospice provider or at an inpatient hospice facility.

A common misconception is that hospice care hastens death because patients &quot;give up&quot; fighting the disease. However, people in hospice care often live the same length of time as patients in the hospital, or longer. Additionally, people receiving hospice care have significantly lower healthcare expenditures.

Hospice care allows patients to spend more time with family and friends. People in institutional (rather than home-care) hospice programs are also in the company of other hospice patients, which provides them with an additional support network.

=== Medications for terminal patients ===
Terminal patients experiencing pain, especially cancer-related pain, are often prescribed opioids to relieve suffering. The specific medication prescribed, however, will differ depending on severity of pain and disease status.

There exist inequities in availability of opioids to terminal patients, especially in countries where opioid access is limited.

A common symptom that many terminal patients experience is dyspnea, or difficulty with breathing. To ease this symptom, doctors may also prescribe opioids to patients. Some studies suggest that oral opioids may help with breathlessness. However, due to lack of consistent reliable evidence, it is currently unclear whether they truly work for this purpose.

Depending on the patient&#x27;s condition, other medications will be prescribed accordingly. For example, if patients develop depression, antidepressants will be prescribed. Anti-inflammation and anti-nausea medications may also be prescribed.

=== Continued treatment ===
Some terminal patients opt to continue extensive treatments in hope of a miracle cure, whether by participating in experimental treatments and clinical trials or seeking more intense treatment for the disease. Rather than to &quot;give up fighting,&quot; patients spend thousands more dollars to try to prolong life by a few more months. What these patients often do give up, however, is quality of life at the end of life by undergoing intense and often uncomfortable treatment. A meta-analysis of 34 studies including 11,326 patients from 11 countries found that less than half of all terminal patients correctly understood their disease prognosis, or the course of their disease and likeliness of survival. This could influence patients to pursue unnecessary treatment for the disease due to unrealistic expectations.

=== Transplant ===
For patients with end stage kidney failure, studies have shown that transplants increase the quality of life and decreases mortality in this population. In order to be placed on the organ transplant list, patients are referred and assessed based on criteria that ranges from current comorbidities to potential for organ rejection post transplant. Initial screening measures include: blood tests, pregnancy tests, serologic tests, urinalysis, drug screening, imaging, and physical exams.

For patients who are interested in liver transplantation, patients with acute liver failure have the highest priority over patients with only cirrhosis. Acute liver failure patients will present with worsening symptoms of somnolence or confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) and thinner blood (increased INR) due to the liver&#x27;s inability to make clotting factors. Some patients could experience portal hypertension, hemorrhages, and abdominal swelling (ascites). Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is often used to help providers decide and prioritize candidates for transplant.

=== Physician-assisted suicide ===
Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is highly controversial, and legal in only a few countries. In PAS, physicians, with voluntary written and verbal consent from the patient, give patients the means to die, usually through lethal drugs. The patient then chooses to &quot;die with dignity,&quot; deciding on their own time and place to die. Reasons as to why patients choose PAS differ. Factors that may play into a patient&#x27;s decision include future disability and suffering, lack of control over death, impact on family, healthcare costs, insurance coverage, personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and much more.

PAS may be referred to in many different ways, such as aid in dying, assisted dying, death with dignity, and many more. These often depend on the organization and the stance they take on the issue. In this section of the article, it will be referred to as PAS for the sake of consistency with the pre-existing Wikipedia page: Assisted Suicide.

In the United States, PAS or medical aid in dying is legal in select states, including Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and New Mexico, and there are groups both in favor of and against legalization.

Some groups favor PAS because they do not believe they will have control over their pain, because they believe they will be a burden on their family, and because they do not want to lose autonomy and control over their own lives among other reasons. They believe that allowing PAS is an act of compassion.

While some groups believe in personal choice over death, others raise concerns regarding insurance policies and potential for abuse. According to Sulmasy et al., the major non-religious arguments against physician-assisted suicide are quoted as follows:
* (1) &quot;it offends me&quot;, suicide devalues human life;
* (2) slippery slope, the limits on euthanasia gradually erode;
* (3) &quot;pain can be alleviated&quot;, palliative care and modern therapeutics more and more adequately manage pain;
* (4) physician integrity and patient trust, participating in suicide violates the integrity of the physician and undermines the trust patients place in physicians to heal and not to harm&quot;
Again, there are also arguments that there are enough protections in the law that the slippery slope is avoided. For example, the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon includes waiting periods, multiple requests for lethal drugs, a psychiatric evaluation in the case of possible depression influencing decisions, and the patient personally swallowing the pills to ensure voluntary decision.

Physicians and medical professionals also have disagreeing views on PAS. Some groups, such as the American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Health Organization, American Nurses Association, Hospice Nurses Association, American Psychiatric Association, and more have issued position statements against its legalization.

The ACP&#x27;s argument concerns the nature of the doctor-patient relationship and the tenets of the medical profession. They state that instead of using PAS to control death: &quot;through high-quality care, effective communication, compassionate support, and the right resources, physicians can help patients control many aspects of how they live out life&#x27;s last chapter.&quot;

Other groups such as the American Medical Students Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Medical Women&#x27;s Association, and more support PAS as an act of compassion for the suffering patient.

In many cases, the argument on PAS is also tied to proper palliative care. The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care issued a position statement arguing against considering legalizing PAS unless comprehensive palliative care systems in the country were in place. It could be argued that with proper palliative care, the patient would experience fewer intolerable symptoms, physical or emotional, and would not choose death over these symptoms. Palliative care would also ensure that patients receive proper information about their disease prognosis as not to make decisions about PAS without complete and careful consideration.

== Medical care ==
Many aspects of medical care are different for terminal patients compared to patients in the hospital for other reasons.

=== Doctor–patient relationships ===
Doctor–patient relationships are crucial in any medical setting, and especially so for terminal patients. There must be an inherent trust in the doctor to provide the best possible care for the patient. In the case of terminal illness, there is often ambiguity in communication with the patient about their condition. While terminal condition prognosis is often a grave matter, doctors do not wish to quash all hope, for it could unnecessarily harm the patient&#x27;s mental state and have unintended consequences. However, being overly optimistic about outcomes can leave patients and families devastated when negative results arise, as is often the case with terminal illness.

=== Mortality predictions ===
Often, a patient is considered terminally ill when his or her estimated life expectancy is six months or less, under the assumption that the disease will run its normal course based on previous data from other patients. The six-month standard is arbitrary, and best available estimates of longevity may be incorrect. Though a given patient may properly be considered terminal, this is not a guarantee that the patient will die within six months. Similarly, a patient with a slowly progressing disease, such as AIDS, may not be considered terminally ill if the best estimate of longevity is greater than six months. However, this does not guarantee that the patient will not die unexpectedly early.

In general, physicians slightly overestimate the survival time of terminally ill cancer patients, so that, for example, a person who is expected to live for about six weeks would likely die around four weeks.

A recent systematic review on palliative patients in general, rather than specifically cancer patients, states the following: &quot;Accuracy of categorical estimates in this systematic review ranged from 23% up to 78% and continuous estimates over-predicted actual survival by, potentially, a factor of two.&quot; There was no evidence that any specific type of clinician was better at making these predictions.

=== Healthcare spending ===
Healthcare during the last year of life is costly, especially for patients who used hospital services often during end-of-life.

In fact, according to Langton et al., there were &quot;exponential increases in service use and costs as death approached.&quot;

Many dying terminal patients are also brought to the emergency department (ED) at the end of life when treatment is no longer beneficial, raising costs and using limited space in the ED.

While there are often claims about &quot;disproportionate&quot; spending of money and resources on end-of-life patients, data have not proven this type of correlation.

The cost of healthcare for end-of-life patients is 13% of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. However, of the group of patients with the highest healthcare spending, end-of-life patients only made up 11% of these people, meaning the most expensive spending is not made up mostly of terminal patients.

Many recent studies have shown that palliative care and hospice options as an alternative are much less expensive for end-of-life patients.

== Psychological impact ==
Coping with impending death is a hard topic to digest universally. Patients may experience grief, fear, loneliness, depression, and anxiety among many other possible responses. Terminal illness can also lend patients to become more prone to psychological illness such as depression and anxiety disorders. Insomnia is a common symptom of these.

It is important for loved ones to show their support for the patient during these times and to listen to his or her concerns.

People who are terminally ill may not always come to accept their impending death. For example, a person who finds strength in denial may never reach a point of acceptance or accommodation and may react negatively to any statement that threatens this defense mechanism.

=== Impact on patient ===
Depression is relatively common among terminal patients, and the prevalence increases as patients become sicker. Depression causes quality of life to go down, and a sizable portion of patients who request assisted suicide are depressed. These negative emotions may be heightened by lack of sleep and pain as well. Depression can be treated with antidepressants and/or therapy, but doctors often do not realize the extent of terminal patients&#x27; depression.

Because depression is common among terminal patients, the American College of Physicians recommends regular assessments for depression for this population and appropriate prescription of antidepressants.

Anxiety disorders are also relatively common for terminal patients as they face their mortality. Patients may feel distressed when thinking about what the future may hold, especially when considering the future of their families as well. It is important to note, however, that some palliative medications may facilitate anxiety.

=== Coping for patients ===
Caregivers may listen to the concerns of terminal patients to help them reflect on their emotions. Different forms of psychotherapy and psychosocial intervention, which can be offered with palliative care, may also help patients think about and overcome their feelings. According to Block, &quot;most terminally ill patients benefit from an approach that combines emotional support, flexibility, appreciation of the patient&#x27;s strengths, a warm and genuine relationship with the therapist, elements of life-review, and exploration of fears and concerns.&quot;

=== Impact on family ===
Terminal patients&#x27; families often also suffer psychological consequences. If not well equipped to face the reality of their loved one&#x27;s illness, family members may develop depressive symptoms and even have increased mortality. Taking care of sick family members may also cause stress, grief, and worry. Additionally, financial burden from medical treatment may be a source of stress. Parents of terminally ill children also face additional challenges in addition to mental health stressors including difficulty balancing caregiving and maintaining employment. Many report feeling as if they have to &quot;do it all&quot; by balancing caring for their chronically ill child, limiting absence from work, and supporting their family members. Children of terminally ill parents often experience a role reversal in which they become the caretakers of their adult parents. In taking on the burden of caring for their sick parent and assuming the responsibilities they can no longer accomplish, many children also experience significant declines in academic performance. 

=== Coping for family ===
Discussing the anticipated loss and planning for the future may help family members accept and prepare for the patient&#x27;s death. Interventions may also be offered for anticipatory grief. In the case of more serious consequences such as depression, a more serious intervention or therapy is recommended. Upon the death of someone who is terminally ill, many family members that served as caregivers are likely to experience declines in their mental health. Grief counseling and grief therapy may also be recommended for family members after a loved one&#x27;s death.

== Dying ==
When dying, patients often worry about their quality of life towards the end, including emotional and physical suffering.

In order for families and doctors to understand clearly what the patient wants for themselves, it is recommended that patients, doctors, and families all convene and discuss the patient&#x27;s decisions before the patient becomes unable to decide.

=== Advance directives ===
At the end of life, especially when patients are unable to make decisions on their own regarding treatment, it is often up to family members and doctors to decide what they believe the patients would have wanted regarding their deaths, which is often a heavy burden and hard for family members to predict. An estimated 25% of American adults have an advance directive, meaning the majority of Americans leave these decisions to be made by family, which can lead to conflict and guilt. Although it may be a difficult subject to broach, it is important to discuss the patient&#x27;s plans for how far to continue treatment should they become unable to decide. This must be done while the patient is still able to make the decisions, and takes the form of an advance directive. The advance directive should be updated regularly as the patient&#x27;s condition changes so as to reflect the patient&#x27;s wishes.

Some of the decisions that advance directives may address include receiving fluids and nutrition support, getting blood transfusions, receiving antibiotics, resuscitation (if the heart stops beating), and intubation (if the patient stops breathing).

Having an advance directive can improve end-of-life care.

It is highly recommended by many research studies and meta-analyses for patients to discuss and create an advance directive with their doctors and families.

=== Do-not-resuscitate ===

One of the options of care that patients may discuss with their families and medical providers is the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. This means that if the patient&#x27;s heart stops, CPR and other methods to bring back heartbeat would not be performed. This is the patient&#x27;s choice to make and can depend on a variety of reasons, whether based on personal beliefs or medical concerns. DNR orders can be medically and legally binding depending on the applicable jurisdiction.

Decisions like these should be indicated in the advance directive so that the patient&#x27;s wishes can be carried out to improve end-of-life care.

=== Symptoms near death ===
A variety of symptoms become more apparent when a patient is nearing death. Recognizing these symptoms and knowing what will come may help family members prepare.

During the final few weeks, symptoms will vary largely depending on the patient&#x27;s disease. During the final hours, patients usually will reject food and water and will also sleep more, choosing not to interact with those around them. Their bodies may behave more irregularly, with changes in breathing, sometimes with longer pauses between breaths, irregular heart rate, low blood pressure, and coldness in the extremities. It is important to note, however, that symptoms will vary per patient.

=== Good death ===
Patients, healthcare workers, and recently bereaved family members often describe a &quot;good death&quot; in terms of effective choices made in a few areas:

* Assurance of effective pain and symptom management.
* Education about death and its aftermath, especially as it relates to decision-making.
* Completion of any significant goals, such as resolving past conflicts.

In the last hours of life, palliative sedation may be recommended by a doctor or requested by the patient to ease the symptoms of death until they die. Palliative sedation is not intended to prolong life or hasten death; it is merely meant to relieve symptoms.

<doc id="712397" wikidata="Q1907332" url="?curid=712397" title="Massachusetts Route 1A">
<text>Route 1A is a north–south state highway in Massachusetts, United States. It is an alternate route to U.S. 1 with three signed sections and two unsigned sections where the highway is concurrent with its parent. Due to the reconfiguration of tunnel interchanges brought on by the completion of the Big Dig, Route 1A is discontinuous in the downtown Boston area. Vehicles entering Downtown Boston via the Sumner Tunnel must take I-93 north to the exit for Government Center and make a U-turn to access the entrance ramp to I-93 south (which silently carries Route 1A south as well) and vice versa.

==Route description==
===Rhode Island border to Attleboro===
A short segment of Route 1A, in length, in Attleboro runs from U.S. Route 1A at the Rhode Island border through a junction with Interstate 95, before heading north and merging with Route 1. The entire length of this segment is known as Newport Avenue.

===North Attleborough to Dedham===
This segment of Route 1A extends roughly north from North Attleborough to Dedham, passing through the towns of Plainville, Wrentham, Norfolk, Walpole, Norwood and Westwood on the way. Prior to its realignment along I-95 and I-93, Route 1 continued north along the Providence Highway towards Boston at the junction of Route 1A and that road.

===Boston to Salisbury===

This segment of Route 1A extends from Boston, Massachusetts to Salisbury, Massachusetts.

The highway starts from US 1 (which is on the Central Artery with I-93 and Route 3) at the former Government Center/Logan Airport interchange. It passes through the Callahan Tunnel (outbound/northbound) and Sumner Tunnel (inbound/southbound), becoming the East Boston Expressway past Logan Airport. The East Boston Expressway was the first freeway built in the city. Immediately beyond Logan Airport, Interstate 90 ends at Route 1A.

The road continues as a divided highway through Revere. It is a limited access highway through Revere, passing Suffolk Downs and the Wonderland Greyhound Park (which is across the street from the outer terminus of the MBTA&#x27;s Blue Line), before running through the isolated Point of Pines neighborhood and exiting Revere over the General Edwards Bridge into Lynn. For the first mile and a half in Lynn, it is concurrent with the Lynnway, and is a high-traffic retail area. After the Lynnway portion, the route becomes concurrent with Route 129 for a mile, before crossing into Swampscott as Paradise Road. At Vinnin Square, it passes into Salem as Loring Avenue, passing by Salem State University. The route turns left onto Lafayette Street and is concurrent with Route 114. At the intersection with Derby Street, notable for the large fire station, the route turns right. At the next stop sign, the route turns left onto Hawthorne Boulevard passing Salem Common and the Salem Witch Museum before turning left onto Winter Street. At the end of Winter Street, the route turns right onto Bridge Street crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge into Beverly. It follows two of the main streets of downtown Beverly, before heading north, passing through Wenham and Hamilton (through this section the road is occasionally signed as a US Route) before becoming the main road through the town of Ipswich, crossing the historic Choate Bridge over the Ipswich River. While in Ipswich, much of the route runs concurrently with Route 133 until just over the town line into Rowley. It passes through the main village of Rowley, as well as the central villages of Newbury. In Newburyport, Massachusetts, it merges with Route 1, signed with its parent highway over the Merrimack River and into the town center of Salisbury. It then heads east from the Salisbury town center before turning north and ending in Salisbury Beach at the New Hampshire border. New Hampshire Route 1A continues north from this point.

==History==
Initially, Route 1A ran along part of its present-day route between the New Hampshire state line and Revere. It then turned west along present-day Route 16 until it ended at US 1 (now Route 99) in Everett. Then, in 1931, an interchange in Revere was built over Route 107 (Broadway). In 1933, another, disconnected portion of Route 1A appeared between Attleboro and the Rhode Island state line. In 1934, two changes were made to the route. In Revere, the route was realigned to turn west smoothly. Between Boston and North Attleborough, a huge portion of Route 11 and all of Route 150 were replaced by Route 1A. The new portion soon got truncated to Dedham in 1936.
It then got truncated even further to end at US 1/Route 128.

===Later history===
After Route C1 was decommissioned in 1971 in favor of a new alignment of US 1, Route 1A was truncated to a roundabout interchange in Revere. As a result, Route 16 extended eastward along the then-former route. After all unbuilt Boston freeways were cancelled by 1973, US 1 was rerouted onto the Northeast Expressway (formerly proposed I-95). As a result of that, Route 1A was extended south towards the Sumner/Callahan Tunnels and then north along Central Artery towards US 1 (Storrow Drive). In 1989, US 1 was rerouted from Storrow Drive onto I-93&#x27;s Southeast Expressway, causing &quot;signed&quot; Route 1A to get truncated.

<doc id="712401" wikidata="Q606568" url="?curid=712401" title="Outlawries Bill">
<text>A Bill for the more effectual preventing clandestine Outlawries, usually referred to as the Outlawries Bill, is customarily the first bill on the agenda of the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Commons at the start of each session of Parliament. It is used symbolically to signal the Commons&#x27; right to consider matters not contained in the speech from the throne (known as a King’s or Queen’s speech) given by the Monarch.

==Ceremonial purpose==

The bill is introduced after the King&#x27;s Speech, after the Commons have returned to their chamber, but before any debate on the contents of the speech. No Member of Parliament presents it, nor has it been ordered to be printed in recent times. It is not intended to make any further progress, but rather bears a symbolic import: by not discussing the contents of the King&#x27;s Speech immediately, the House of Commons are demonstrating that they can debate on whatever they choose and have the right to set their own business regardless of the Monarch.

The practice of giving a first reading to a bill before debating the Speech dates back to at least 1558; the purpose of this practice was first explained in a 1604 bill. Various bills were used for the purpose; originally they were just normal bills and could progress to a second reading. The Outlawries Bill was first introduced in the 1727 session and has been used at the start of every session thereafter (except for 1741 and 1742).

John Wilkes interrupted the reading of the bill in 1763, to complain about his imprisonment, but the Speaker required Commons to first deal with the bill. In 1794 Richard Brinsley Sheridan used the reading of the bill to raise the subject of the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act.

The usefulness of the bill was last considered in 2002. The Procedure Committee investigated the history of the bill and determined that because it has symbolic meaning and takes very little time to announce, there is no need to abandon it.

===Other legislatures===
The equivalent bill used by the House of Lords is the Select Vestries Bill.

In Canada, similar &quot;pro forma&quot; bills are introduced in both houses of Parliament, numbered bills C-1 and S-1. They are traditionally entitled &quot;An Act respecting the Administration of Oaths of Office&quot; in the House of Commons and &quot;An Act relating to Railways&quot; in the Senate, although the text of neither bill makes any mention of oaths of office or railways.

In the Australian House of Representatives, a new bill is drafted for this purpose each time (in the 46th Parliament this was the &quot;Agriculture Legislation Repeal Bill 2019&quot;) and is presented by the Prime Minister. Unlike the Canadian equivalent, the bills&#x27; contents do address the respective subject matters and could theoretically be enacted like any other bill. However, a second reading is never moved. A &quot;pro forma&quot; bill is not used in the Australian Senate; instead, other formal business, such as question time, ministerial statements and/or other bills, is transacted before consideration of the governor-general&#x27;s speech.

The Parliament of Northern Ireland (in existence 1921–1972) also gave a first reading to the Outlawries Bill after the Speech from the Throne (delivered by the Governor of Northern Ireland, except in 1921 when King George V appeared in person).

==Background==

The term &quot;outlawry&quot; referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside of the sphere of legal protection. In the common law of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system to protect them if needed, e.g. from mob justice. To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of civil death. No one was allowed to give food, shelter, or any other sort of support – to do so was to commit the crime of aiding and abetting, and to be in danger of the ban oneself. In effect, (criminal) outlaws were criminals on the run who were &quot;wanted dead or alive&quot;.

By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime they were outlawed for. If accused of a crime and, instead of appearing in court and defending oneself from accusations, fled from justice, they were committing serious contempt of court, which was itself a capital crime; so even if innocent of the crime originally accused, they were guilty of evading justice (&quot;see also:&quot; bench warrant).

There was also civil outlawry. Civil outlawry did not carry capital punishment with it, and it was imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions such as debts or torts. The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.

In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in civil procedure by reforms that no longer required summoned defendants to appear and plead. Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of civil duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and in Scots law until the late 1940s. Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff (&quot;see:&quot; default judgment), and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply.

==Content==
Since the bill is now neither printed nor debated, its exact text is unclear. The following outlawry bill, as introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria, may serve as an illustration for such a bill&#x27;s form; Parliament&#x27;s website states that &quot;the text has remained the same since Victorian times&quot;. Missing details such as dates or penalties are indicated in brackets.

When a defendant in civil or criminal cases could not be found, the reason would not always be clear. A person might depart for perfectly innocent reasons and be completely unaware that a criminal accusation or civil suit might be brought against them after departure. The English common law, however, established a rule that if a defendant could not be found (or did not show up for court) after a certain waiting period and proper public advertisements, they could be assumed to have fled or hid to escape justice, and subjected to the appropriate punishments for contempt of court.

A &quot;clandestine outlawry&quot; would be a judgment of outlawry passed against a defendant without giving the legal action proper publicity and the defendant adequate opportunity to be notified and answer the charges (&quot;see also:&quot; sewer service). The Outlawries Bill contemplates two manners in which this might happen.

The first possibility considers that litigants – whether attorneys, solicitors or any other persons – might know the county where the defendant is dwelling, but nevertheless fail to send or deliver the Writ of Proclamation to the sheriff of the proper county. In other words, they might sue a defendant in a remote place and, knowing where the defendant lives, fail to contact the defendant by official channels.

The second possibility refers to a previous Act of Outlawry describing the proper proclamations to be made to seek a legal defendant, and considers that a sheriff might neglect or refuse to make such proclamations, and nevertheless report (returning the writ) that the person was not found (and therefore presumed to be escaping justice).

The text of the Outlawries Bill provides penalties for both kinds of malefactors (sheriffs and plaintiffs), leaving blanks for the actual penalties, to be decided during further discussion of the bill.

Before the Outlawries Bill became a symbolic custom, several Outlawry Acts were passed into English law: the Outlawry Act 1331 (5 Edw. 3. cc. 12 &amp; 13), in 1363 (37 Edw. 3), in 1406 (7 Hen. 4), in 1532 (23 Hen. 8. c. 14), and the Avoidance of Secret Outlawries Act 1588 (31 Eliz. 1. c. 3), none of which appears to be still in force.

<doc id="712409" wikidata="Q1758030" url="?curid=712409" title="Urkesh">
<text>Urkesh, also transliterated Urkish (Akkadian: 𒌨𒆧𒆠 UR.KIŠKI, 𒌨𒋙𒀭𒄲𒆠 UR.KEŠ3KI; modern Tell Mozan; ), is a tell, or settlement mound, located in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains in Al-Hasakah Governorate, northeastern Syria. It was founded during the fourth millennium BC, possibly by the Hurrians, on a site which appears to have been inhabited previously for a few centuries. The city god of Urkesh was Kumarbi, father of Teshup.

==Geography==
There are other contemporary ancient sites in this area of upper Khabur River basin. For example, Chagar Bazar is 22 km south of Mozan. Tell Arbid is located 45 km south of Tell Mozan. Tell Brak is about 50 km to the south.

Tell Leilan is located about 50 km to the east of Urkesh. Leilan, Brak and Urkesh were particularly prominent during the Akkadian period.

==History==
===Early Bronze IVA===
====Akkadian period====
Urkesh is the only third millennium site that can be securely associated with the Hurrians. Throughout the Bronze Age, the city was a major Hurrian center. Seal inscriptions give evidence for a city ruler with the Hurrian name of Tupkish, and his queen with the Akkadian name of Uqnitum. Tupkish, who ruled during the ascendancy of the Akkadian Empire, assumed the title of &quot;king of Urkesh and Nagar&quot;. The king was known by the title of &quot;endan&quot;, meaning king in Hurrian.

Urkesh was an ally of the Akkadian Empire through what is believed to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar&#x27;am-Agade, the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, is believed to have been married to the king of Urkesh.

===Middle Bronze IIA===
====Zimri-Lim of Mari====
During the second millennium BC the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointee) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that &quot;I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on my account. But you are mine, even if the city of Urkesh is not.&quot;

===Late Bronze II===
====Mitanni period====
In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site.

The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BC, although the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time.

==Archaeology==

The entire site covers around , mostly made up of the outer city. The high mound covers about and rises to a height of , with 5 sub-mounds. The high mound is surrounded by a mudbrick city wall that was roughly wide and high.

Important excavated structures include the royal palace of Tupkish, an associated necromantic underground structure (Abi), a monumental temple terrace with a plaza in front and a temple at the top, residential areas, burial areas, and the inner and outer city walls.

Soundings at the site were first made by Max Mallowan during his survey of the area. Agatha Christie, his wife, wrote that they chose not to continue at the site because it seemed to have Roman material. No trace of Roman occupation levels have been found in later excavations, however. Mallowan went on to excavate Chagar Bazar, another site to the south of Mozan/Urkesh. Excavations at Tell Mozan began in 1984 and have been conducted for at least 17 seasons up to the present time. The work has been led by Giorgio Buccellati of UCLA and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati of California State University, Los Angeles.
The 2007 season was primarily dedicated to working on publication material, primarily excavation units A16, J1, J3 and J4. A small sounding was done in J1 to clarify the transition between Mittani and Khabur. The excavations have been assisted at various times by other groups including the German Archaeological Institute.

The excavations at Tell Mozan are known for the project&#x27;s interest in pursuing the uses of technology in an archaeological context. The main focus is on the &#x27;Global Record&#x27;, a method of documentation that combines journal entries into a hypertext based output. This system marries the advantages of both the database and prose type approaches, in that elements are individually linked across both stratigraphy and typology, and yet remain tied in a more synthetic whole through the narrative of the archaeological record. Another focal point of research at the site is the application of conservation.
The mud brick architecture which comprises the majority of the structures found to date has been preserved over the years though an innovative system. This system protects the monument while still allowing a detailed inspection of the primary document as originally unearthed. The same system affords an overview of the architectural volumes as perceived by the ancients. A sizeable lab in the field research facility allows the conservators to give the best possible on-site care while interacting with the excavations.

Special emphasis is placed on documenting the concrete types of contact which are observed in the ground. This is done with great detail at the level of each individual feature. From this evidence is automatically derived a complete depositional history of all elements in contact. The strata are conceived as segments of this continuum in which a single depositional moment can be reconstructed. The phases are periods that are culturally identifiable on the basis of typological and functional analysis. Horizons are the broad chronological subdivisions based on comparative material and as they can be linked to the general historical understanding.

One of the most important fixed points of reference for chronology are impressions on door sealings of the seal of Tar&#x27;am-Agade, the daughter of Naram-Sin, which because of stratigraphy can be firmly linked to phase 3 of the AP palace occupation.

Finds from the excavations at Tell Mozan are on display in the Deir ez-Zor Museum.

===Syrian Civil War 2015-present===
Excavations are on hold during the Syrian Civil War since 2011. The site lies close to the Turkish border, and is protected by Kurdish troops and a team of local workers.

==Kings of Urkesh==
The kings of the city were known by the title of &quot;endan&quot;, meaning king in Hurrian. The known kings of Urkesh include:

*Tupkish (c. 2250 BC)
*Tish-atal (date unknown)
*Shatar-mat (date unknown)
*Atal-shen (date unknown)
*Te&#x27;irru (c. 1800 BC)

<text>James Thomas Patrick Walsh (September 28, 1943 – February 27, 1998) was an American character actor. His many films include: &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Hoffa&quot; (1992), &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (1996), &quot;Breakdown&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
Walsh was born in San Francisco, California. He had three siblings: Christopher, Patricia, and Mary. 

After graduating from college in 1967, Walsh worked briefly as a VISTA volunteer in Newport, Rhode Island organizing tenants for the United Tenant Organizations of Rhode Island (UTO) before resigning to pursue his acting career. Prior to becoming an actor, he also worked as a barman, an encyclopedia salesman, a junior high school teacher, a gymnasium equipment salesman, and a reporter. In 1974, he was discovered by a theater director and began working in off-Broadway shows, where he began using the initials &quot;J. T.&quot; to avoid confusion with another stage actor named James Walsh.

==Career==

On stage, Walsh received critical acclaim for his performance as John Williamson in the 1984 U.S. premiere of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; in Chicago and subsequently on Broadway. He did not appear in films until 1983, when he had a minor role in &quot;Eddie Macon&#x27;s Run&quot;. Over the next 15 years, he appeared in over 50 feature films, increasingly taking the villain role for which he is well known, such as Sergeant Major Dickerson in &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987). On television, he again portrayed an evil character, prison warden Brodeur on the 1995 &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;The List&quot;.

Among the films Walsh appeared in are &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), &quot;Sniper&quot; (1993), &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1994), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), &quot;Executive Decision&quot; (1996), &quot;Sling Blade&quot; (1996), and he also played the rather sympathetic Marine Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992). He played a member of Majestic 12 in the 1996 sci-fi drama series &quot;Dark Skies&quot;. Walsh notably played real people in three films: journalist Bob Woodward in &quot;Wired&quot; (1989), Teamsters president Frank Fitzsimmons in &quot;Hoffa&quot; (1992), and Richard Nixon&#x27;s domestic advisor John Ehrlichman in &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995).

The 1997 thriller &quot;Breakdown&quot;, which featured Walsh as villainous truck driver Warren &quot;Red&quot; Barr, was his last starring film released during his lifetime. In his final year of life, Walsh starred in &quot;The Negotiator&quot; (1998), &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998), and &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot; (1999), all of which were dedicated to his memory.

==Personal life and death==

Walsh died of a heart attack in the hospital in La Mesa, California, on February 27, 1998, at the age of 54, after feeling ill and collapsing at the Optimum Health Institute in Lemon Grove. According to author Marc Seifer, for whom Walsh had narrated a documentary a few weeks earlier, Walsh had experienced chest pains and had an EKG test done that resulted in a misdiagnosis.

Jack Nicholson, who acted with Walsh in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;Hoffa&quot;, dedicated his Best Actor Oscar for &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; to him. 

In his tribute to Walsh in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston wrote:

<doc id="712415" wikidata="Q169361" url="?curid=712415" title="Zebda">
<text>Zebda (from , , ) is a French band from Toulouse, known for its political activism and its wide variety of musical styles. The group, which was formed in 1985, consisted of seven musicians of diverse nationalities, and the themes of much of their music involved political and social justice, the status of immigrants and minorities in France, and the inhabitants of the French &quot;banlieues&quot;, or suburbs. Zebda earned widespread recognition, as well as several awards, for its 1998 single &quot;Tomber la chemise&quot; (&quot;Taking Off Shirt&quot;). In 2001, the band spearheaded an independent political party that won over 12% of the first-round vote in Toulouse&#x27;s municipal elections. The band was disbanded in 2003 but reformed in 2011.

==History==
Zebda was first formed in 1985 when Magyd Cherfi, a community organizer at the time, organized a small group of his musician friends to shoot a video for a community organization for which he was working. More members joined the group later—several of the members met one another through involvement in community projects geared towards supporting arts and music involvement among Toulouse youth. The group began performing together regularly in 1988. The band gained widespread recognition when they performed at the Printemps de Bourges music festival in 1990 and then performed on an international tour which included venues in Great Britain, Italy and France.

The group released its first album, &quot;L&#x27;arène des rumeurs&quot;, in 1992, under the label of Barclay Records. As the band toured and performed, the members continued to be active in community work, and Zebda became known for its politicized lyrics. Its 1995 album, &quot;Le bruit et l&#x27;odeur&quot; (&quot;The Noise and the Smell&quot;) took its name from a gaffe made by then-president Jacques Chirac in reference to the conditions in the French &quot;banlieues&quot;, many of which have large immigrant populations. The record itself had a strong critical and commercial reception and has been said to have &quot;cause[d] a major stir&quot; in France.

In 2003, Zebda released its only live album, &quot;La Tawa&quot;, after which the band split up.

The group reformed in 2011 and toured France. A new album, &quot;Second tour&quot;, was released in January 2012.

===Political involvement===

&quot;Zebda&quot; (زبدة, transliterated &quot;Zubda&quot; or &quot;Zabda&quot;), the Arabic word for butter (&quot;beurre&quot; in French), is a play on the word &quot;beur&quot;, a French slang word referring to French citizens of North African origin—several of the group&#x27;s members are of North African and other immigrant descent. As Zebda was originally formed for a community organization and many of the members met through social initiatives and activism, the band remained highly political throughout its existence. Bruce Crumley of the Culture Kiosque has called the group &quot;politically engaged and culturally committed&quot; and &quot;politically progressive.&quot; Much of the group&#x27;s music and lyrics have centered on issues of political and social justice among the immigrant community and inhabitants of the &quot;banlieues&quot;. In fact, Bangor University&#x27;s Jonathan Ervine, in a deconstructive analysis of Zebda&#x27;s music and identity, states that &quot;Zebda&#x27;s music invokes both the virtues of multiculturalism and the problems that exist within French society regarding the treatment of immigrants, ethnic minorities, and young people from France&#x27;s &quot;banlieues&quot;. Difference, discrimination, and exclusion are themes that feature heavily in &quot;J&#x27;y suis, j&#x27;y reste&quot; [a song from the album &quot;Utopie d&#x27;occase&quot;].&quot; The themes of Zebda&#x27;s music were known for dealing with issues of racism and intolerance.

In 1997, three members of Zebda formed a group called &quot;Tactikollectif,&quot; which was involved in fund-raising and advocacy for immigrant groups in the &quot;banlieues&quot;. In the 2001 municipal elections, Zebda sponsored and spearheaded a list of independent candidates, &quot;Les Motivé-e-s&quot; (&quot;The Motivated Ones&quot;), who ran for office on the platform that the current local government was not representative of all demographic groups in the city. &quot;Les Motivé-e-s&quot; was also dedicated to encouraging local youth and immigrants to vote and become more involved in local political issues. The group of candidates, two of whom were Zebda band members, won 12.38% of the vote in the first-round elections, and advanced to the second round, where they were narrowly defeated.

After the band&#x27;s breakup in 2003, the individual members continued to be active in local politics and other activities for social advocacy.

==Musical style==
Zebda&#x27;s music is influenced by its band members&#x27; multicultural background as well as music from all over the world. The group&#x27;s songs have incorporated rock, and reggae styles, and musical instruments and styles as diverse as Latin music, Arab, and French accordion. While the content and themes of their music are politically serious, typically detailing racism and discrimination, the group has been said to have a positive and &quot;upbeat&quot; sound that represents the ideal of peaceful coexistence and cultural diversity.

The group is best known for its single &quot;Tomber la chemise&quot; (&quot;Take Off Your Shirt&quot;), from the 1998 platinum album &quot;Essence ordinaire&quot;. In addition to being a commercial success, the song went on to be named the best French song of 2000 at both the Victoires de la musique awards and the NRJ Music Awards.

===Awards===

**Best band (2000)

<text>Donald Paul Hodel (born May 23, 1935) is an American former politician who served as United States Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Interior. He was known during his tenure as Secretary of the Interior for his controversial &quot;Hodel Policy,&quot; which stated that disused dirt roads and footpaths could be considered right-of-ways under RS 2477.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported a factual error regarding a leak of false information by a State Department staffer, which the staffer falsely attributed to Hodel, that rather than reduce the production of CFCs to prevent ozone layer destruction, people should wear hats and use sunscreen. Hodel never made that statement. 

Hodel’s press secretary, David Prosperi, got wind of the story about to run in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and called to intervene but they ignored his attempt and ran with the leak from State falsely attributed to Hodel.

==Early life and education==
Hodel was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Philip E. Hodel and Theresia R. Brodt Hodel. He attended Harvard University. In 1957 he married Barbara Beecher Stockman, who was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended Wellesley College. She married Hodel during her senior year.

They moved to Oregon after graduation and Hodel earned his J.D. at the University of Oregon. While living in Oregon, the Hodels had two sons, and Barbara became a full-time mother.

After their elder son&#x27;s suicide, the Hodels became evangelical Christians. They became active in church and other Christian ministries and began speaking at evangelical meetings and prayer breakfasts. The Hodels have appeared on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; with Pat Robertson, &quot;The Hour of Power&quot; with Robert Schuller and on Focus on the Family broadcasts with James Dobson, encouraging families that have also lost loved ones to suicide.

==Government career==
From 1972 to 1977, Hodel was the administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. After leaving it, he said that the Pacific Northwest would eventually need all the power that would be produced by the nuclear power plants proposed by the Washington Public Power Supply System.

Hodel served as United States Secretary of Energy from 1982 to 1985 and Secretary of the Interior from 1985 to 1989 under President Ronald Reagan. He had been Undersecretary of the Interior under James Watt.

Critics disrupted his efforts to impose a new management policy on a large amount of federal land and blocked his efforts to create vast new wilderness areas. In spite of the criticisms, the Reagan administration added over two million acres (8,000 km²) to the national wilderness system. The Hodel policy was continued under Manuel Lujan Jr. in the George H. W. Bush administration. It was rescinded in 1997 by Secretary Bruce Babbitt.

In an article, Hodel wrote, &quot;Throughout President Reagan&#x27;s eight years, his secretaries of the Interior pursued these objectives within the framework of his and their conviction that America could have both an improving environment and an adequate energy supply. We did not and do not have to choose between them, as some have contended.&quot;

While secretary, Hodel proposed to undertake a study on the removal of the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam in Yosemite National Park, and the restoration of Hetch Hetchy Valley, a smaller but inundated version of Yosemite Valley. Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, which owns the dam, opposed the study and had it quashed.

In March 1984, the Navajo Nation requested that Secretary of the Interior William Clark make a reasonable adjustment of the coal lease royalty rate paid by Peabody Coal, now Peabody Energy. In July 1985, the newly appointed Hodel secretly met &quot;ex parte&quot; with Peabody&#x27;s representative, &quot;a former aide and friend of Secretary Hodel&quot;. After briefly reviewing the proposals&#x27; merits, Hodel approved lease amendments with royalty rates well below the rate that had previously been determined appropriate by the agencies responsible for monitoring the federal government&#x27;s relations with Native Americans. In 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that those actions breached the government&#x27;s duty of trust to the Nation and established a &quot;cognizable money-mandating claim&quot; against the government under the Indian Tucker Act.

==Post-government career==
Hodel moved to Colorado, where he engaged in the energy consulting business and served on various charitable and corporate boards of directors. He is the author of &quot;Crisis in the Oil Patch&quot; (Regnery, 1995).

From June 1997 to February 1999, Hodel served as president of the Christian Coalition, a nonprofit conservative political group founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.

From May 2003 to March 2005, Hodel served as president and CEO of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit evangelical Christian organization. He said his job was to manage the transition from the founder, James Dobson, to his successor. Several years before being named president, Hodel had served on its board, and he remained on the board until October 2005.

Hodel was also chairman of the company FreeEats.com, aka ccAdvertising, which has disseminated automated, interactive voice response (IVR) phone calls for conservative causes, the Economic Freedom Fund.

== Environmental efforts ==
As Secretary of the Interior, in 1985 Hodel ordered the acquisition of a ranch in southern Arizona that became the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge. Encompassing approximately of savanna grassland in the Altar Valley, the refuge was created for the masked bobwhite quail. This refuge contains the United States&#x27; only population of the masked bobwhite quail.

, Hodel serves as chairman emeritus at Summit Power Group, Inc., a Seattle-based developer of wind, solar and gas-fired power plants. In 1989, he was the founder and managing director of Summit&#x27;s predecessor company.

<text>[[Triathlon]] made its official debut at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, Australia. This sporting event was held at the Sydney Opera House. Forty-eight triathletes contested the female event on September 16, while fifty-two contested the male event on September 17, making up a total of 100 competitors. Each competitor starts the event with a 1500-metre swim course, followed by a 40 kilometre road bicycle race and finish with a 10 kilometre road run. Each consecutive event in triathlon runs in sequence, without any respite, so that the athlete who crossed the line in first place at the end of the run would be the winner.

==Medalists==
Five nations won medals in the two inaugural triathlon events. Switzerland was the only nation to earn more than one, winning a gold and a bronze in the women&#x27;s competition.

<doc id="712430" wikidata="Q1238125" url="?curid=712430" title="Kronecker product">
<text>In mathematics, the Kronecker product, sometimes denoted by ⊗, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. It is a specialization of the tensor product (which is denoted by the same symbol) from vectors to matrices and gives the matrix of the tensor product linear map with respect to a standard choice of basis. The Kronecker product is to be distinguished from the usual matrix multiplication, which is an entirely different operation. The Kronecker product is also sometimes called matrix direct product.

The Kronecker product is named after the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker (1823–1891), even though there is little evidence that he was the first to define and use it. The Kronecker product has also been called the &quot;Zehfuss matrix&quot;, and the &quot;Zehfuss product&quot;, after , who in 1858 described this matrix operation, but Kronecker product is currently the most widely used term. The misattribution to Kronecker rather than Zehfuss was due to Kurt Hensel.

== Definition ==
If A is an matrix and B is a matrix, then the Kronecker product is the block matrix:

:formula_1

more explicitly:

:formula_2

Using formula_3 and formula_4 to denote truncating integer division and remainder, respectively, and numbering the matrix elements starting from 0, one obtains 
:formula_5 
:formula_6 
For the usual numbering starting from 1, one obtains
:formula_7
:formula_8

If A and B represent linear transformations and , respectively, then the tensor product of the two maps is a map represented by .

=== Examples ===
:formula_9

Similarly:

:formula_10

== Properties ==

=== Relations to other matrix operations ===
) = \exp(\mathbf{N}) \otimes \exp(\mathbf{M}) &lt;/math&gt;

Kronecker sums appear naturally in physics when considering ensembles of non-interacting systems. Let &quot;Hk&quot; be the Hamiltonian of the &quot;k&quot;th such system. Then the total Hamiltonian of the ensemble is
:formula_11
| 9 = Vectorization of a Kronecker product:
Let formula_12 be an formula_13 matrix and formula_14 a formula_15 matrix. When the order of the Kronecker product and vectorization is interchanged, the two operations can be linked linearly through a function that involves the commutation matrix, formula_16. That is, formula_17 and formula_18 have the following relationship:

:formula_19

Furthermore, the above relation can be rearranged in terms of either formula_20 or formula_21 as follows:

:formula_22

where 
:formula_23
| 10 = Outer Product:
If formula_24 and formula_25 are arbitrary vectors, then the outer product between formula_26 and formula_27 is defined as formula_28. The Kronecker product is related to the outer product by: formula_29.

=== Abstract properties ===
== Matrix equations ==
The Kronecker product can be used to get a convenient representation for some matrix equations. Consider for instance the equation , where A, B and C are given matrices and the matrix X is the unknown. We can use the &quot;vec trick&quot; to rewrite this equation as
:formula_30

Here, vec(X) denotes the vectorization of the matrix X, formed by stacking the columns of X into a single column vector.

It now follows from the properties of the Kronecker product that the equation has a unique solution, if and only if A and B are invertible .

If X and C are row-ordered into the column vectors u and v, respectively, then 
:formula_31

The reason is that
:formula_32

=== Applications ===
For an example of the application of this formula, see the article on the Lyapunov equation. This formula also comes in handy in showing that the matrix normal distribution is a special case of the multivariate normal distribution. This formula is also useful for representing 2D image processing operations in matrix-vector form.

Another example is when a matrix can be factored as a Kronecker product, then matrix multiplication can be performed faster by using the above formula. This can be applied recursively, as done in the radix-2 FFT and the Fast Walsh–Hadamard transform. Splitting a known matrix into the Kronecker product of two smaller matrices is known as the &quot;nearest Kronecker product&quot; problem, and can be solved exactly by using the SVD. To split a matrix into the Kronecker product of more than two matrices, in an optimal fashion, is a difficult problem and the subject of ongoing research; some authors cast it as a tensor decomposition problem.

In conjunction with the least squares method, the Kronecker product can be used as an accurate solution to the hand–eye calibration problem.

== Related matrix operations ==
Two related matrix operations are the Tracy–Singh and Khatri–Rao products, which operate on partitioned matrices. Let the matrix A be partitioned into the blocks A&quot;ij&quot; and matrix B into the blocks B&quot;kl&quot;, with of course , , and .

=== Tracy–Singh product ===
The Tracy–Singh product is defined as
:formula_33

which means that the (&quot;ij&quot;)-th subblock of the product is the matrix , of which the (&quot;k&quot;)-th subblock equals the matrix . Essentially the Tracy–Singh product is the pairwise Kronecker product for each pair of partitions in the two matrices.

For example, if A and B both are partitioned matrices e.g.:
:formula_34

we get:
:formula_35

=== Khatri–Rao product ===

* Block Kronecker product
* Column-wise Khatri–Rao product

=== Face-splitting product ===

Mixed-products properties
: formula_36

where formula_37 denotes the Face-splitting product.

: formula_38

Similarly:
: formula_39

: formula_40

where formula_41 and formula_42 are vectors,

: formula_43

where formula_41 and formula_42 are vectors, and formula_46 denotes the Hadamard product.

Similarly:
: formula_47
: formula_48

where formula_49 is vector convolution and formula_50 is the Fourier transform matrix (this result is an evolving of count sketch properties),

: formula_51

where formula_52 denotes the column-wise Khatri–Rao product.

Similarly:
: formula_53
: formula_54
where formula_41 and formula_42 are vectors.

<text>Quantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics a statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator &quot;S&quot;, which is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; describing the quantum system. This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics.

== Expectation ==
From classical probability theory, we know that the expectation of a random variable &quot;X&quot; is defined by its distribution D&quot;X&quot; by
:formula_1
assuming, of course, that the random variable is integrable or that the random variable is non-negative. Similarly, let &quot;A&quot; be an observable of a quantum mechanical system. &quot;A&quot; is given by a densely defined self-adjoint operator on &quot;H&quot;. The spectral measure of &quot;A&quot; defined by

:formula_2

uniquely determines &quot;A&quot; and conversely, is uniquely determined by &quot;A&quot;. E&quot;A&quot; is a Boolean homomorphism from the Borel subsets of R into the lattice &quot;Q&quot; of self-adjoint projections of &quot;H&quot;. In analogy with probability theory, given a state &quot;S&quot;, we introduce the &quot;distribution&quot; of &quot;A&quot; under &quot;S&quot; which is the probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of R by
:formula_3
Similarly, the expected value of &quot;A&quot; is defined in terms of the probability distribution D&quot;A&quot; by
:formula_4
Note that this expectation is relative to the mixed state &quot;S&quot; which is used in the definition of D&quot;A&quot;.

Remark. For technical reasons, one needs to consider separately the positive and negative parts of &quot;A&quot; defined by the Borel functional calculus for unbounded operators.

One can easily show:
:formula_5
The trace of an operator &quot;A&quot; is written as follows:
:formula_6 
Note that if &quot;S&quot; is a pure state corresponding to the vector formula_7, then:
:formula_8

== Von Neumann entropy ==

Of particular significance for describing randomness of a state is the von Neumann entropy of &quot;S&quot; &quot;formally&quot; defined by
:formula_9. 
Actually, the operator &quot;S&quot; log2 &quot;S&quot; is not necessarily trace-class. However, if &quot;S&quot; is a non-negative self-adjoint operator not of trace class we define Tr(&quot;S&quot;) = +∞. Also note that any density operator &quot;S&quot; can be diagonalized, that it can be represented in some orthonormal basis by a (possibly infinite) matrix of the form
:formula_10
and we define
:formula_11
The convention is that formula_12, since an event with probability zero should not contribute to the entropy. This value is an extended real number (that is in [0, ∞]) and this is clearly a unitary invariant of &quot;S&quot;.

Remark. It is indeed possible that H(&quot;S&quot;) = +∞ for some density operator &quot;S&quot;. In fact &quot;T&quot; be the diagonal matrix
:formula_13
&quot;T&quot; is non-negative trace class and one can show &quot;T&quot; log2 &quot;T&quot; is not trace-class.

Theorem. Entropy is a unitary invariant.

In analogy with classical entropy (notice the similarity in the definitions), H(&quot;S&quot;) measures the amount of randomness in the state &quot;S&quot;. The more dispersed the eigenvalues are, the larger the system entropy. For a system in which the space &quot;H&quot; is finite-dimensional, entropy is maximized for the states &quot;S&quot; which in diagonal form have the representation
:formula_14
For such an &quot;S&quot;, H(&quot;S&quot;) = log2 &quot;n&quot;. The state &quot;S&quot; is called the maximally mixed state.

Recall that a pure state is one of the form 
:formula_15
for ψ a vector of norm 1.

Theorem. H(&quot;S&quot;) = 0 if and only if &quot;S&quot; is a pure state.

For &quot;S&quot; is a pure state if and only if its diagonal form has exactly one non-zero entry which is a 1.

Entropy can be used as a measure of quantum entanglement.

== Gibbs canonical ensemble ==

Consider an ensemble of systems described by a Hamiltonian &quot;H&quot; with average energy &quot;E&quot;. If &quot;H&quot; has pure-point spectrum and the eigenvalues formula_16 of &quot;H&quot; go to +∞ sufficiently fast, e−&quot;r H&quot; will be a non-negative trace-class operator for every positive &quot;r&quot;.

The &quot;Gibbs canonical ensemble&quot; is described by the state 
:formula_17
Where β is such that the ensemble average of energy satisfies 
:formula_18

and

:formula_19

This is called the partition function; it is the quantum mechanical version of the canonical partition function of classical statistical mechanics. The probability that a system chosen at random from the ensemble will be in a state corresponding to energy eigenvalue formula_20 is

:formula_21

Under certain conditions, the Gibbs canonical ensemble maximizes the von Neumann entropy of the state subject to the energy conservation requirement.

== Grand canonical ensemble ==

For open systems where the energy and numbers of particles may fluctuate, the system is described by the grand canonical ensemble, described by the density matrix
:formula_22
where the &quot;N&quot;1, &quot;N&quot;2, ... are the particle number operators for the different species of particles that are exchanged with the reservoir. Note that this is a density matrix including many more states (of varying N) compared to the canonical ensemble.

The grand partition function is
:formula_23

<text>Pietro Carrera (July 12, 1573 – September 18, 1647) was an Italian chess player, historian, priest and author.

== Biography ==
Pietro Carrera born in Sicily, in Militello in Val di Catania (Province of Catania), located in the Valley of Noto; here he grew up in the old colony of San Vito. He was the son of Donna Antonia Severino (mother) and Mariano Carrera, a traditional craftsman who entered the priesthood after his wife&#x27;s death. During his studies in the Seminario Diocesiano of Siracusa, he had the opportunity to visit many different Sicilian cities. As a result of his travels he met Paolo Boi, so-called &quot;The Siracusan&quot;, in the town of Palermo during 1597.

After taking his vows, he first become the chaplain at the church of S. Maria della Stella and later of Francesco Branciforte&#x27;s Court (the Prince of Pietraperzia and Marchese of Militello). During his stay at Branciforte&#x27;s Court he became interested in chess, winning against Salvatore Albino the so-called &quot;Beneventano&quot; and against Geronimo Cascio. Cascio won against the famous but old Polerio. After developing a fond relationship with the Prince&#x27;s wife, Lady Giovanna, he composed a short poem for her in Latin in hexameter form regarding chess. Only fragments of this poem, the title being &quot;The Pessopedia&quot;, remain today.

In 1617 he wrote and published &quot;Il Gioco degli Scacchi&quot; (&quot;The Game of Chess&quot;), subdivided into eight books where &quot;learning the rules, the odds, the endgames, the blindfold chess and a discussion about the true origins of chess in itself&quot;. This was the first book ever printed in Militello, on request of his patron Branciforte, by Giovanni Rosso from Trento; in this poem Carrera collected and elaborated in a systematic fashion information given by previous authors.

After the Prince of Branciforte&#x27;s death in 1622, he moved to Messina, then to Canicattì and finally to Catania. Here in 1635, using an alias, he published the &quot;Risposta di Valentino Vespaio contro l&#x27;apologia di Alessandro Salvio&quot; (&quot;Valentino Vespaio&#x27;s answer against Alessandro Salvio&#x27;s explanation&quot;), where he debated the accusations and criticisms made against him from Salvio.

Famous and esteemed, he died on September 18, 1647, in Messina.

Carrera is also remembered as the inventor of chess variant (Carrera&#x27;s chess) on an 8x10 chessboard, in which there were added two new pieces called the &quot;Champion&quot; (a combination of the moves of the tower (rook) and the knight) and &quot;Centaurus&quot; (a combination of the bishop and the knight); these innovations had more fame than the ones made by Piacenza and Marinelli. It was a predecessor of Capablanca Chess.

He is not remembered as a great live player but as a master of theory and a great source of information regarding contemporary players of his time.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1868, a Spanish military expedition was dispatched to study the possibility of relocating the Cavite Naval Station in Subic Bay due to its unhealthy condition.

Spanish King Alfonso XII through a Royal Decree made Subic Bay (then called Subig) as Spain&#x27;s stronghold in the Far East in 1884. Vice Admiral Juan Bautista de Antiquiera made Olongapo a settlement for the Spanish Navy.

On March 8, 1885, the Spanish Naval commission authorized construction of the Arsenal in Olongapo. The Spanish planned to transform their naval station and the village of Olongapo into an island, safeguarding it from potential rebel attacks. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal. The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense.

Within ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost fifteen years developing the naval station. From higher naval commands, the order was sent to fortify Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay. In the meantime, during the Philippine Revolution, a fleet led by the Cuban-Filipino Admiral Vicente Catalan seized the naval base at Subic-Olongapo from the Spanish for the First Philippine Republic.

===American occupation===

On May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was nearly complete when Admiral Dewey&#x27;s flagship, , led the Asiatic Fleet into Manila Bay. A detachment of Dewey&#x27;s fleet bombarded the navy yard. Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States. This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands.

Realizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; US President Theodore Roosevelt, on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes.

The naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States.

Olongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station. More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment. To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change. The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard. Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy.

Olongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing through the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness.

===Japanese occupation ===
When the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated. Olongapo was twice destroyed.

On December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw. Olongapo was set aflame by the Filipinos in anticipation of the Japanese arrival. The USS &quot;New York&quot; was scuttled in Subic Bay. When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the Bataan peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came.

In 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the war. The general headquarters between the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army &amp; Philippine Constabulary were located in Olongapo during and after World War II, and were active until 1946 after operating against the Japanese for the liberation of Central Luzon.

===Postwar Era===
In 1946, the Philippines was granted independence. Olongapo was one of the principal naval bases retained by the United States. The Navy started rebuilding the town after hostilities ceased. Olongapo was built on a new undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former location. The prewar town site became part of the base.

The first few years after the war were difficult for the new town, as everything in the new Olongapo was damaged. There were no electric power and no drainage system. The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate, and streets were unpaved. Gradually, Olongapo evolved into a new community: new businesses were established, housing projects were planned and civic facilities were restored.

During the Korean War, the United States spent over to convert the base into the homeport of the Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest US installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to the intersection of what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after American practice where streets are constructed along straight lines. The magnitude of facilities construction in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180.

===Cityhood===

Unlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after World War II in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation. The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board. Olongapo&#x27;s 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the US Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried in US Navy courts. In July 1955, Manila mayor Arsenio Lacson announced that American service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of US Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo.

On October 23, 1959, Olongapo was placed under martial law when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed and the US Navy declined to identify or try the Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot him.

Olongapo was the last piece of Philippine territory surrendered by the United States to the country in the 1950s. On December 7, 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano. The first mayor appointed was civic leader Ruben Geronimo. He was later succeeded by business entrepreneur Ildefonso Arriola.

Six years later, through the efforts of Representative Ramon Magsaysay Jr. in Congress and Senator Genaro Magsaysay in the Senate, President Ferdinand Marcos signed R.A. 4645. Olongapo was reconverted to a chartered city on June 1, 1966.

Olongapo was eventually upgraded to the status of a highly urbanized city (HUC) on December 7, 1983.

=== Marcos dictatorship era ===

The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Olongapo and Zambales. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy to take a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship.

In Olongapo, the continuation of the Vietnam war through this period meant the arrival of a constantly growing number of U.S. Sailors to adjacent U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, which was headed by Manuel Ardonia. The base was visited by 215 ships per month as the Vietnam War peaked in 1967, and it employed 15,000 Filipino civilians.

However, this also meant the rapid growth of prostitution in the areas around the base. The policies of the Marcos administration encouraged the growth of the sex-industry because it increased the flow of higher value currency into the Philippine economy.

The economies of Olongapo and the nearby areas of Zambales evolved from a largely agricultural orientation at the end of the 1960s towards one built around sex industry related businesses such as bars by the mid-1970s. The nightclubs along Ramon Magsaysay Drive between the naval base main gate and Rizal Avenue were notoriously popular among the 4,225,000 servicemen visiting the base that year. Sailors&#x27; accounts recall the popularity of musical performances, inexpensive San Miguel beer, attractive teenage prostitutes, erotic floor shows, Jeepney rides back to the naval base and children diving for coins tossed from the bridge over the estuarine drainage channel in front of the naval base main gate were popular amenities among the sailors.

=== Mount Pinatubo eruption ===


On June 15, 1991, Mount Pinatubo, from the city, violently erupted with a force eight times greater than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Volcanic clouds blocked out the sun. Volcanic earthquakes and heavy muddy rain, as well as thunderstorms from a typhoon passing over Central Luzon, darkened the area for 36 hours in what would become known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;.
This caused widespread damage to the United States facility and Olongapo City.

On September 16, 1991, the Senate leaders of the Philippines did not grant an extension of the existing RP-US Military Bases Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States, thus terminating the stay of the United States military in the Philippines.

===Contemporary era===
Olongapo surged to national prominence during the incumbency of Mayor Richard Gordon, who, like his father before him, was against the departure of US military forces, yet lobbied for the turnover of the facility and its conversion into a freeport in 1992. Gordon spearheaded a volunteerism strategy to return an ailing economy to prosperity after Mount Pinatubo&#x27;s eruption and the withdrawal of US forces. The strategy worked across all demographics and involved a strong corps of 8,000 volunteers who protected and preserved the abandoned base facilities from poachers. Gordon complemented this with an aggressive advocacy campaign to convert the area into a protected area and industrial zone. Later, he launched an aggressive international investment promotion which resulted in the accelerating the development of a prime industrial and tourism zone in the country, the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ).

As the first chartered city and highly urbanized city in its province, Olongapo&#x27;s reputation among Filipinos rose from being a &quot;sin city&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s into a &quot;model city&quot; in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.

A recent racial study showed that Angeles City, Pampanga; alongside Manila; and Olongapo, Zambales; was the locations of several concentrations of 250,000 Amerasians (Mixed American-Asians) who were born as a result of the American colonization of the Philippines and the presence of US bases in the country.

The airport is within the Subic Bay Freeport Zone and was formerly known as Naval Air Station Cubi Point, when it was still an airbase of the United States.

==== Sea Port ====

In the city&#x27;s main district, the names of those streets running from North to South follow the English alphabet&#x27;s order. While streets running East to West are numbered from 1st to 27th, starting from the South parallel and up. Even streets are on the East side of the city while the odd streets are on the West.

=== Public Utilities ===

==== Electricity ====
Electricity services were formerly provided by the government-run Public Utilities Department (PUD) since the city was founded. However, in the late 2000s, the city faced debt in its electricity distribution costs amounting to P5 billion to power suppliers and threatened to cut the city from the Luzon power grid. Then Mayor James Gordon Jr. also attributed the crisis to low collection rate due to nonpayment or debts incurred by consumers, widespread energy theft and corruption in the PUD. The situation worsened because of interests imposed by Private Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), the refusal of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to grant an increase in power rates, and the years of delay in the PUD&#x27;s privatization.

In 2013, through Republic Act No. 10373, the PUD was sold for Php 610 million to Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company (OEDC), an affiliate of Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (CEPALCO), which was given a 25-year franchise to take over the city&#x27;s power distributor.

Not to be confused with Subic Water District (SWD), which is a different water distribution company serving the neighboring towns of Subic, Zambales.).

<doc id="712473" wikidata="Q16931824" url="?curid=712473" title="NAIA ice hockey championship">
<text>The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) held a men&#x27;s national ice hockey championship from 1968 to 1984 when ice hockey was dropped as an NAIA sport.

==Early history==
The NAIA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship held a single elimination competition to determined the collegiate national champion from the inaugural 1968 to 1984. The tournament began as a four-team tournament but expanded to six and eight teams during the peak time-frame during the 1970s and early 1980s. The tournament returned to the 4-team format for the final two seasons with declining hockey participation at the NAIA level. In total, the NAIA sponsored men&#x27;s ice hockey as a championship sport for 17 years. The schools were consolidated in the Northern United States and the tournament field primarily consisted between schools in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, with occasional contenders from New England and Alaska. NAIA ice hockey also had an international presence in the early years of the championship with membership in Ontario. In total, ice hockey at the NAIA level consisted of between 30 and 50 schools. It was discontinued in 1984 after the NCAA created a Division III national championship.

===Tournament format history===
;1968–1972
: 4 teams (single elimination)

;1973–1974
: 6 teams (single elimination)

;1975–1982
: 8 teams (single elimination)

;1983-1984
: 4 teams (single elimination)

==Winners of the NAIA national ice hockey championship==

==Recent history==
During the summer of 2015, a group of schools fielding the sport began working with the NAIA administrators in an effort to gain emerging sport status and work to eventually sponsoring the sport at the championship level again. The NAIA requires a minimum of 15 schools to sponsor a sport at the varsity level to begin the process from emerging to championship categories.

In 2016, several NAIA institutions that sponsor men&#x27;s ice hockey teams announced the formation of a coaches association and a new division for NAIA ice hockey program to begin play during the 2017–18 season. The division will initially operate under the guidance of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) during the emerging sport phase of the process to regain NAIA championship sport status. The new division will allow these NAIA schools to align their standards with the institution&#x27;s other NAIA sports, including distinct differences from the other ACHA divisions in terms of player eligibility, operational procedures, and athletic financial aid.

The Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) made history in July 2017, by adding men&#x27;s ice hockey as conference sports effective the fall of 2017. The WHAC became the first conference in the NAIA to offer the sport as a conference championship sport. Initially, the five conference members that sponsor ice hockey will participate in a conference championship. In July 2017, Concordia University Ann Arbor announced that the university will begin an ice hockey program and begin competition in the NAIA Division and WHAC Hockey Conference in the 2018–19 season.

In April 2020, Roosevelt University began to sponsor men&#x27;s ice hockey after inheriting Robert Morris University&#x27;s men&#x27;s team and its ACHA membership because Robert Morris was integrated into Roosevelt a month before.

<text>Junk faxes are a form of telemarketing where unsolicited advertisements are sent via fax transmission. Junk faxes are the faxed equivalent of spam or junk mail. Proponents of this advertising medium often use the terms &quot;broadcast fax&quot; or &quot;fax advertising&quot; to avoid the negative connotation of the term &quot;junk fax&quot;. Junk faxes are generally considered to be a nuisance since they waste toner, ink and paper in fax machines.

Junk faxing came into widespread use in the late 1980s as a result of the development and proliferation of relatively inexpensive desktop fax machines which resulted in rapid growth in the number of fax machines in the U.S. The invention of the computer-based fax board in 1985 by Dr. Hank Magnuski, provided an efficient platform for reaching those fax machines with minimal cost and effort.

The fax machines of this period typically used expensive thermal paper and a common complaint about junk faxes was that they consumed that expensive paper without permission, thus shifting the cost of printing the advertisement to the recipient.

In the U.S., the passage of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 along with action by individual states reduced the use of junk faxes at that time. However, by the late 1990s, junk faxing had once again become a widespread problem in the U.S., with the entry of a number of large-scale fax broadcasters who boasted of the capacity to send millions of fax advertisements per day. Because the legal restrictions of fax advertising are more widely known today, junk faxes are now predominately used in connection with disreputable or fly-by-night marketers.

==National regulations==

===United States===
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (47 USC 227), or TCPA, among other things specifically outlawed junk faxing:

:the use of &quot;any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine&quot; (paragraph (b)(1)(C))

The TCPA also requires a fax transmitter to identify the source phone number and transmitting organization or individual on each page. The process of war dialing to determine what phone numbers reach fax machines was also prohibited by the FCC rules under the TCPA.

The TCPA, in particular the junk fax provision, has been challenged in court on First Amendment grounds, but the law has withstood legal challenges.

In 2005, the United States Congress passed the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. It amended the TCPA so as to no longer prohibit unsolicited fax advertisements if:
:&quot;the unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with an established business relationship with the recipient&quot;(paragraph (b)(1)(C)(i))

and the sender complies with other requirements.

In April 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) implemented changes to the fax advertising rules of the TCPA. The new rules: (1) codify an established business relationship (EBR) exemption to the prohibition on sending unsolicited fax advertisements; (2) define EBR as used in the context of unsolicited fax advertisements; (3) require the sender of fax advertisements to provide specified notice and contact information on the fax that allows recipients to &quot;opt-out&quot; of any future transmissions from the sender; and (4) specify the circumstances under which a request to &quot;opt-out&quot; complies with the Act. The new rules took effect in August 2006.

The federal TCPA permits state junk faxing laws that are equal to or more restrictive than the federal law, and so many states have their own laws regarding junk faxes. Additionally, some courts have ruled that unsolicited fax advertisements are common law conversion, independent of any statutory provisions or exemptions.

====Enforcement====
The FCC can investigate violations and impose fines on the violators. Individuals who receive junk faxes can file a complaint with the FCC. Complaints must specify:

* That the sender did not have permission to send the fax (i.e. unsolicited)
* That the complainant did not have a prior business relationship with the sender
* That the fax was for a good or service
* Any telephone number or addresses included in the fax
* Your name, address, and a telephone number where you can be reached during the day
* The telephone number through which you received the fax advertisement
* A copy of the fax advertisement, if possible, or confirmation that you have retained a copy of the fax

Failure to provide any of the above information may result in the complaint being closed without further action.

State authorities can also take actions against violations of the TCPA.

It is also possible for the recipient of a junk fax to bring a private suit against the violator in an appropriate court of their state. Through a private suit, the recipient can either recover the actual monetary loss that resulted from the TCPA violation, or receive $500 in damages for each violation, whichever is greater. The court may triple the damages for each violation if it finds that the defendant acted willingly or knowingly. The FCC and/or the FTC can impose additional civil penalties of up to $11,000.00 per fax transmitted.
=== United Kingdom ===
According to the government legislation on 1 May 1999, it is unlawful to send an individual an unsolicited sales and marketing fax without any prior consent of the customer. If the fax receiver is a company or corporate instances, fax communications are permitted unless the subscriber has previously notified the caller that such communications should not be sent on that line; or the subscriber’s line is listed in the register kept under regulation 25 of PECR. This register is maintained on behalf of OFCOM by the Direct Marketing Association and is branded as the Facsimile Preference Service (&quot;FPS&quot;). 

===Canada===
Unsolicited faxes are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and must follow certain guidelines, but there is no individual right to sue the senders. Information on the rules of telemarketing faxes in Canada can be found in the CRTC Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules. Individuals wishing to avoid such faxes may enroll in the CRTC&#x27;s National Do Not Call List; its effectiveness, however, is a point of controversy.

===Hong Kong===
The Office of the Telecommunications Authority (OTA) has implemented regulations to address junk faxes. Complaints will result in disconnection of the offenders&#x27; phone service.

<text>Michael Henry &quot;Nicko&quot; McBrain (born 5 June 1952) is an English musician, best known as the drummer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden since 1982. He is the third-longest serving member of the band, having appeared on each Iron Maiden album since &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; (1983). McBrain retired from touring in 2024, although he remains a member of the band for studio projects. Having played in small pub bands since 1966 from the age of 14, after leaving school, McBrain did session work before joining a variety of artists, such as Streetwalkers in 1975, Pat Travers, and the French political band Trust.

== Early life and education ==

McBrain was born in Hackney, London, and first wanted to learn the drums at a young age after watching Joe Morello performing with The Dave Brubeck Quartet on television. At the age of ten, he started to play drums with pots, pans and other kitchen utensils, before, to his parents&#x27; dismay, he began drumming on the gas cooker with a pair of knives and chipped off the paintwork. McBrain recalls that he was eleven or twelve before his father bought him his first drum kit, &quot;which was basically one snare, one tom-tom, one cymbal, two drumsticks and a pair of brushes.&quot; He soon started playing Rolling Stones and Beatles covers with school bands, before he began regularly playing &quot;pubs and weddings&quot; by the age of 14.

McBrain had his nose broken in a fight at school which left him with his trademark flat features.
He never underwent surgery to repair his nose.

== Musical career ==
McBrain&#x27;s first &quot;proper&quot; band was &quot;The 18th Fairfield Walk&quot;, later known as &quot;Peyton Bond&quot;, a small pub band, which he decided was &quot;never gonna go anywhere&quot; as they only performed Otis Redding, The Beatles and The Who covers. McBrain soon left to join &quot;The Wells Street Blues Band&quot;, which renamed themselves &quot;The Axe&quot; in 1969, a group which played their own material. This band split up after an argument between the singer and the guitarist, and McBrain began playing with Billy Day, a singer and keyboardist, and Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Lesley, a guitarist, in 1971. At that point, he was known as &quot;Nicky&quot;, a nickname given to him by his parents after his teddy bear, Nicholas, until an intoxicated Billy Day introduced him to Dick Asher, head of CBS Records, as &quot;Neeko&quot;, while they were recording at CBS Studios, Whitfield Street. McBrain liked the name, changing it to &quot;Nicko&quot; &quot;so that it sounded more English&quot;, and decided to keep it even after leaving the group.
In 1973, McBrain performed on a single by Cockerel Chorus, &quot;Nice One Cyril&quot;, on the label Young Blood.

Also in 1973, McBrain played on a self-titled album by guitarist Gordon Giltrap. This is notable not only as McBrain&#x27;s album debut, but also because Giltrap in 1978 released an album called &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and used a font for his logo that is quite similar to the one used by Iron Maiden.

In 1975, he began playing with Streetwalkers, before joining Pat Travers, singer Jenny Darren, McKitty and then the French band, Trust, with whom he met Iron Maiden for the first time, while touring together in 1981. In 1982, the band asked McBrain to replace Clive Burr, and as news of Burr&#x27;s departure had not yet been announced, McBrain made his first appearance with Iron Maiden on German TV disguised as Eddie. He formed a close partnership with bassist Steve Harris, and completed what many critics consider the band&#x27;s &quot;definitive&quot; line-up, releasing a series of gold and platinum selling albums throughout the 1980s.

While the band&#x27;s line-up went through several changes during the 1990s, McBrain remained in Iron Maiden, and since the return of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson in 1999 the group has undergone a resurgence in popularity, and are now considered by some as &quot;bigger than ever&quot;.

When he&#x27;s not recording and touring with Iron Maiden, McBrain often plays with side projects including a band called McBrain Damage which played Iron Maiden covers. In March 2017, he was a guest drummer with the 8G Band on Late Night with Seth Meyers.

McBrain writes all the drum parts for Iron Maiden&#x27;s songs. He received only one songwriting credit on an album, for &quot;New Frontier&quot;, from 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, which expresses his opposition to human cloning, arising from his religious beliefs. He had previously received two songwriting credits for non-album tracks: 1984&#x27;s &quot;Mission From &#x27;Arry&quot;, which was actually a recording of a backstage argument with Steve Harris, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Nodding Donkey Blues&quot;, which were B-sides of the singles &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; and &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot;, respectively.

===Retirement from touring===
On 7 December 2024, McBrain announced his retirement from touring with Iron Maiden, with Dickinson stating that he still remains as a member of the band. He played his final live performance with the band that same day in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Metal Injection called it &quot;a major moment in metal history.&quot;

The band confirmed Nicko&#x27;s live replacement to be Simon Dawson, who is the drummer for British Lion, Steve Harris&#x27; hard rock side project.

== Artistry ==
McBrain&#x27;s drumming has been an important element of Iron Maiden&#x27;s sound from 1983&#x27;s &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; onwards, with guitarist Adrian Smith remarking that, &quot;he always had the chops and the technique, but in Maiden he really exploded, to the point where a lot of stuff we did after he joined was then founded on his playing, all those busy patterns he does, displaying tremendous technique.&quot; As described in detail on the band&#x27;s 2004 documentary, &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; opening track, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, famously displays McBrain&#x27;s ability to use the single drum pedal very quickly, plus his rapid tom fills. In the 2008 &quot;Live After Death&quot; DVD, Steve Gadd, McBrain&#x27;s then drum technician (not to be confused with the other one), comments that, on the World Slavery Tour, some drummers would refer to McBrain as an &#x27;octopus&#x27; after witnessing the way in which his stamina gives him the ability to use all of his large signature drum kit in concert.

McBrain often employs the back end of his left hand drum stick to allow for more powerful &quot;snare hits&quot;. He is known for not using a double bass pedal, with Bruce Dickinson commenting that he refused to use one on &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, considering them &#x27;undrummerish&#x27;. He claims to have only ever used a double pedal once on &quot;Face in the Sand&quot;, from &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, preferring to use a DW 5000 Accelerator single pedal. Since switching to the DW pedal in 2000, McBrain plays barefoot, stating that it gives him &quot;more freedom.&quot;

Steve Harris remarks that &quot;...he can play all kinds of music. Drummers from other bands sit round the back of him to see what he&#x27;s doing, but he&#x27;s got his kit set so he doesn&#x27;t even look at what he&#x27;s hitting half the time&quot;. After McBrain joined the band in 1982, Harris also noted how much easier playing with McBrain was for a songwriter, with Adrian Smith claiming that, &quot;Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.&quot;

In 1988, McBrain collaborated with Andrew Chapman on a book entitled &quot;Iron Maiden &amp; Nicko McBrain&#x27;s Rhythms of the Beast&quot;, which was published by Warner Bros. Music in 1990. The book featured complete transcriptions of McBrain&#x27;s drum work on twelve classic Iron Maiden songs, including six live versions as recorded on the band&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Live After Death&quot;. After selling internationally for several years, the book was taken out of print. Used copies are occasionally found for sale online.

In 1991, McBrain released an instructional drum video, entitled &quot;Rhythms of the Beast&quot; (not related to the above book of the same name), which was re-released on DVD in 2010. The video features McBrain demonstrating his technique, and covers tuning, soloing and parts of the drum kit.

== Awards, accolades and titles ==
Nicko McBrain is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal/hard rock drummers of all time. In 2008, he was inducted into Guitar Centre&#x27;s Drum Legends Hall of Fame and, in 2020, into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame. A year later McBrain was inducted into Rhythm Magazine Hall of Fame.

In March 2024, McBrain performed in three concerts during the 52nd Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall. He stated that his involvement in this cultural event was a once-in-a-lifetime honour.

Since 2019, McBrain has been an International Brand Ambassador and Director of British Drum Company.

== Equipment ==
McBrain is a long-time user of Paiste cymbals and currently plays British Drum Company drums, moving from Sonor Drums and having previously endorsed Premier. For &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; he used his Ludwig metal shell LM 402 snare drum which was purchased in 1975, making it the oldest drum in his kit. He endorses his own signature line of drum sticks made by Vic Firth. As of 2016, McBrain also uses Remo drumheads, Sonor hardware, an LP cowbell and a DW 9000 single pedal.

While touring in 1986–87, he played a Sonor Phonic Plus High Tech drum kit.

In 2010, McBrain used a Premier Elite drum kit.
In 2016, McBrain played on a Sonor SQ² Custom drum kit made of beech, with a snare drum of birch.

In 2022, McBrain announced his new endorsement with the British Drum Company (or BDC).

In 2023, McBrain announced his switch from Remo drumheads to Code drumheads.

== Personal life ==
McBrain is married to Rebecca McBrain (née Dempsey) and has two sons from his first marriage, born 1983 and 1992. He lives in Boca Raton, Florida.

McBrain converted to Christianity in 1999 after an experience in the Spanish River Church, near his Boca Raton home. His wife, Rebecca, had been asking him to attend with her, and upon entering the church, McBrain soon found himself crying as he experienced a &quot;calling&quot;. Recounting the tale, he said &quot;I just sat there thinking, &#x27;I didn&#x27;t drink last night... why can&#x27;t I stand?&#x27; I had this love affair with Jesus going on in my heart.&quot;

In 1988, McBrain appeared as a guest on &quot;The Sooty Show&quot;, in which he played drums with Sooty and Sweep. In reference to his appearance on the show, McBrain&#x27;s drum kit has since been decorated with a Sooty puppet, which is often dressed accordingly with the band&#x27;s corresponding tours.

McBrain has a pilot&#x27;s licence, for which he has a twin engine rating.

In 2003, McBrain was arrested prior to an Iron Maiden show in Wantagh, New York. While pulling into the venue&#x27;s VIP parking lot, an attendant asked for McBrain&#x27;s credentials. Following a misunderstanding, McBrain threatened to drive into the attendant, and did so twice, injuring the attendant on the second attempt. McBrain was arrested and charged with third-degree assault and second-degree reckless endangerment. He was released on an appearance ticket, allowing him to perform in the show.

In 2009, he opened a restaurant called Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Ribs in Coral Springs, Florida. The restaurant received positive reviews on an episode of &quot;Check, Please! South Florida&quot; and was awarded &quot;Best Ribs of 2012&quot; by &quot;New Times Broward-Palm Beach&quot;.

McBrain is a fan of snooker and has attended the World Snooker Championships at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield.
He enjoys playing golf in his spare time, along with his bandmate Dave Murray, and is a friend of Swedish golfer and Florida resident Jesper Parnevik, whom he met at Ullna Golf Club in Sweden.

McBrain is an enthusiast of Jaguar Cars, and bought a custom XKR-S model built to his specifications in 2012. In March 2018, &quot;Jaguar Land Rover Classic Works&quot; revealed a customised Jaguar XJ Series III for McBrain.

In 2015, McBrain stopped drinking alcohol after seeing an interview in which he had had too much wine and has remained sober.

In 2018, he launched a musical instrument store named Drum One in Manchester, England. The retailer specialises in drum kits and related merchandise. To promote the launch of the store, McBrain conducted an interview with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice.

On 3 August 2023, McBrain released a statement via the bands&#x27; YouTube page, explaining in a video that he had been unwell in January 2023. It was explained further in the video description that McBrain suffered from a stroke in January and was paralyzed on his right side from the shoulder down. After 10 weeks of intensive physical therapy, McBrain was able to join the rest of the band at rehearsals in May 2023, ahead of their European leg of the Future Past World Tour. Manager Rod Smallwood put out a statement saying that &quot;The rest of the band and l think that what Nicko has been able to achieve since his stroke shows incredible belief and willpower and we are all very proud of him. With this new and musically very complex set to learn ahead of him, he just got his head down and concentrated on recovery. We honestly did not know if he would be able to play a whole show until band rehearsals started in May and there was just so much support for him from the band and then genuine relief for all when we saw he was going to be able to do it!&quot;.

<text>Sailing at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney was held from 17 to 30 September 2000 at the Olympic Sailing Shore Base in the Sydney Harbour.

The quota for sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics was 400, of which 124 positions were for men, 92 for women and 184 &#x27;open&#x27; to men or women. The Sailing Program of 2000 consisted of a total of eleven sailing classes (disciplines). For each class with the exception of the Soling and the 49er, eleven races were scheduled from 17 to 30 September 2000. For the Soling six fleet races were scheduled followed by a series of match races for the top twelve boats of the fleet race result. The 49er had sixteen scheduled fleet races. The sailing was done on six course areas and several types of course configurations.

The Sydney 2000 Games featured a name change for the sport, previously known as yachting.

== Venue ==

The choice of Sydney Harbour as the sailing venue allowed a huge number of spectators access to the action. However, there was not a great level of interest for this and only 2000 tickets had been sold one month before the start of the event.

The Olympic Sailing Shore Base was located on parts of Rushcutters Bay Park, Yarranabbe Park, the Sir David Martin Reserve and the waters of Rushcutters Bay. The shore base was used for logistic support and competition management and included temporary structures for the sailing events such as a marina for 250 boats. A new permanent public jetty for water taxis was also constructed.

Variable weather patterns necessitated a flexible competition schedule. Four course areas inside Sydney Harbour were used in combination with two offshore course areas. The Soling match racing was staged in Farm Cove at the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House.

<doc id="712489" wikidata="Q1122206" url="?curid=712489" title="Salt Lake Temple">
<text>The Salt Lake Temple is a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. At , it is the largest Latter-day Saint temple by floor area. Dedicated in 1893, it is the sixth temple completed by the church, requiring 40 years to complete, and the fourth temple built since the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1846. The temple was closed in December 2019 for a general remodelling and seismic renovations, which were initially estimated to take approximately four years. Subsequent updates extended the estimated completion to 2026, for a total renovation timeline lasting an anticipated six or seven years.

==Details==

The Salt Lake Temple is the centerpiece of the Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. Like other Latter-day Saint temples, the church and its members consider it sacred and a temple recommend is required to enter, so there are no public tours inside the temple as there are for other adjacent buildings on Temple Square. In 1912, the first public photographs of the interior were published in the book &quot;The House of the Lord&quot;, by James E. Talmage. Since then, various photographs have been published, including by &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1938. The temple grounds are open to the public and are a popular tourist attraction. Due to its location at church headquarters and its historical significance, Latter-day Saints from around the world patronize the temple.

The Salt Lake Temple is also the location of the weekly meetings of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As such, there are special meeting rooms in the building for these purposes, including the Holy of Holies, which are not part of other temples.

The temple includes some elements thought to evoke Solomon&#x27;s Temple at Jerusalem. It is oriented towards Jerusalem and the large basin used as a baptismal font is mounted on the backs of twelve oxen, as was the Molten Sea in Solomon&#x27;s Temple (see 2 Chronicles 4:2–4). (However, the literal interpretation of the Biblical verses has been disputed.) At the east end of the building, the height of the center pinnacle to the base of the angel Moroni is .

===Location===
The temple is in downtown Salt Lake City, with several mountain peaks close by. Nearby, a shallow stream, City Creek, splits and flows both to the west and to the south, flowing into the Jordan River. There is a wall around the temple site. The surrounding wall became the first permanent structure on what has become known as Temple Square. The wall is a uniform high but varies in appearance because of the site&#x27;s southwest slope.

==Uses==
The temple is considered the house of God and is reserved for special ceremonies for practicing Latter-Day Saints. The main ordinance rooms are used during the endowment ceremony—namely the creation, garden, telestial, terrestrial, and celestial rooms in that order of use. A washing and anointing ceremony is also administered, and until 1921, the rooms were also used for healing rituals of washing and anointing for the sick or pregnant and were administered by women and men. The temple also serves as a place for marriage sealing ceremonies for live and deceased persons. Additional uses include functioning as a location for baptisms for the dead, baptisms for health (until being discontinued in 1921), and, briefly, for re-baptism for the renewal of covenants. Other rituals performed in the temple include the second anointing ordinance for live and deceased persons, and meeting rooms for church leaders.

==Temple construction and dedication==

The temple&#x27;s location was first marked by Brigham Young, the church&#x27;s second president, on July 28, 1847, just four days after he arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. He marked a location between two forks of City Creek saying &quot;Here will be the Temple of our God&quot;. In 1901, church apostle Anthon H. Lund recorded in his journal that &quot;it is said&quot; that Oliver Cowdery&#x27;s divining rod was used to locate the temple site. The temple site was dedicated on February 14, 1853, by Heber C. Kimball. The groundbreaking ceremony was presided over by Young, who laid the cornerstone on April 6, 1853, the twenty-third anniversary of the church being organized. The architect was Truman O. Angell, and the temple features both Gothic and Romanesque elements.

An annex, designed by Joseph Don Carlos Young, is built 100 feet north of the temple. The construction of the annex started in 1892, and it was opened in 1893, at the same time as the temple itself. This building included a large entrance area and an assembly hall. In August of 1962, the main temple was closed. A new annex was opened at the north end of the temple square in March of 1966, which largely expanded the temple&#x27;s capacity with a 400 seat chapel, underground dressing rooms, 4,000 lockers and large waiting rooms for marriage ceremonies. Both the annex and the addition were built using the same granite from the original quarry and designed to match the temple&#x27;s architecture. 

Sandstone was originally used for the foundation. During the Utah War, the foundation was buried and the lot made to look like a plowed field to prevent unwanted attention from federal troops. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the troops were called away by December. In the spring, when the foundation was uncovered to continue work, it was discovered that many of the foundation stones had cracked, making them unsuitable to hold the weight of the massive temple. Although not all of the sandstone was replaced, the inadequate sandstone was replaced. The walls are quartz monzonite (which has the appearance of granite) from Little Cottonwood Canyon, southeast of the temple site. Oxen transported the quarried rock initially, but as the Transcontinental Railroad neared completion in 1869 the remaining stones were carried by rail at a much faster rate.

During the construction, the temple grounds were seized by the US Marshal as a result of the Edmunds–Tucker Act of 1886. It was later returned to the Latter-day Saints.
The capstone—the granite sphere that holds the statue of the Angel Moroni—was laid on April 6, 1892, by means of an electric motor and switch operated by Wilford Woodruff, the church&#x27;s fourth president, thus completing work on the temple&#x27;s exterior. The Angel Moroni statue, standing tall, was placed on top of the capstone later the same day. At the capstone ceremony, Woodruff proposed the building&#x27;s interior be finished within one year, which would allow the temple to be dedicated forty years, to the day, after its commencement. John R. Winder was instrumental in overseeing the interior&#x27;s completion on schedule; he would serve as a member of the temple presidency until his death in 1910. Woodruff dedicated the temple on April 6, 1893, exactly forty years after the cornerstone was laid.

===2019 to 2026 renovation ===

At the end of 2019, the temple was closed for a seismic retrofitting designed to allow it to withstand a magnitude 7.3 earthquake, the strongest expected magnitude in the Salt Lake Valley; work was expected to take about four years. Other facilities on Temple Square (and certain parts of the main temple) were to be demolished, reconstructed, and modernized in line with seismic code.
Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems will be replaced, Initially the interior and its historical artifacts were planned to be preserved (although plans were later changed and many historic elements were removed) and plazas and landscaping modified. Visitor access and tourism would remain during the entire renovation process, but in regulated and coordinated fashion.

Prior to 2019, the building had never been decommissioned for renovation and only minor updating of finishes and systems had occurred within the temple proper (although multiple &quot;annex&quot; additions had been added and removed in the past). This meant the temple&#x27;s core historic architecture, layout, and workmanship had been preserved for 126 years.

Before reconstruction started, church leaders indicated that the temple&#x27;s unique historicity would be preserved. Church employees stated that special efforts would be made to highlight and honor the pioneer craftsmanship and indicated the interiors would essentially remain the same. Various renderings were released showing the instruction rooms used for the endowment ceremony would remain intact, with the original layout, woodwork and murals being preserved.

In March 2021, the church announced significant changes to the renovation plan that affected many elements in the temple&#x27;s historic interior. The progressive room-to-room live endowment ceremony would be removed and the layout of the temple would change, with the baptistry being moved to the annex and new instruction rooms constructed in its place. Other rooms and walls would be reconfigured, requiring the removal of the temple&#x27;s murals. The murals and many other historic features of the building were photographed and otherwise documented before being permanently removed or destroyed. These changes will allow for greater patron capacity, but the removal of many historic elements was met with criticism, especially the destruction of the temple&#x27;s murals. One prominent historian described the changes as a &quot;huge and unnecessary loss&quot; and another noted them as a loss of &quot;priceless cultural artifacts&quot;.

In December 2021, the church updated estimations for the renovation completion for 2025, and in March 2023, estimates for the completion were again extended to 2026. If the latest estimations prove accurate, the total reconstruction period will have lasted between six and seven years.

After stating in an October 2024 general conference address that renovations were expected to conclude by the end of 2026, church president Russell M. Nelson announced in February 2025 that a public open house is expected to be held from April to October 2027.

==Symbolism==

The Salt Lake Temple incorporates many symbolic adornments including Masonic symbols. Symbolism is an important subject to members of the LDS Church. These symbols include the following:
* All-seeing eye – The center tower on each side has a depiction of the all-seeing eye of God representing how God sees all things.

* Angel statue – The golden Angel Moroni statue, by sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin, tops the capstone of the temple. It symbolizes the angel mentioned in that will come to welcome in the Second Coming of Christ. Early architectural plans showed two horizontally flying angels and the earliest references to the Salt Lake Temple&#x27;s angel were always Gabriel. The original blueprint drawings intended the angel to be wearing temple ceremonial clothing like the angel on the Nauvoo Temple, but Paris-trained sculptor Dallin&#x27;s statue wears a crown instead of a temple cap that included a bright light which created a halo effect at night. As a result of an earthquake on March 18, 2020, the statue&#x27;s trumpet broke. A new statue was installed April 2, 2024.
* Beehive – The beehive symbol (which appears on the Utah state seal) appears on external doors and doorknobs and symbolizes the thrift, industry, perseverance, and order of the Mormon people.
* Big Dipper – On the west side of the temple the Big Dipper appears, which represents how the priesthood can help people find their way to heaven as the constellation helped travelers find the North Star. The uppermost stars on the temple&#x27;s constellation align with the actual North Star, which symbolizes the direction of the heavens.
* Compass and square – Early plan drawings of the temple show the Masonic arrangements of a compass and square placed around the second and fourth floor windows, but the plans were changed during construction. These symbols had appeared on the Nauvoo Temple weathervane.
* Clasped hands – Above each external door and doorknob appears the &quot;hand clasp,&quot; which is a representation of covenants that are made within temples or brotherly love. According to scholars Hugh Nibley and Donald Parry, clasped hands &quot;have always represented recognition and acceptance of those who were once apart,&quot; along with reciprocation of knowledge.
* Clouds – On the east side of the temple are &quot;clouds raining down&quot; representing the way God has continued revelation and still speaks to man &quot;like the rains out of Heaven&quot; or alternatively a veil of ignorance or sin.
* Earths – The Earthstones in the lower buttresses have been interpreted as the gospel of Christ spreading over the whole Earth. Each of the fifty buttresses is four feet wide and weighs over six thousand pounds. Each buttress has a moonstone at the midpoint and a sunstone at the top, with earth being the third, each of the three degrees of glory - telestial, terrestrial, and celestial - are represented here.

* Saturns – Early drawings and a written description by Angell showed Saturnstones along the top tier of the temple, though the design was changed years later.
* Spires – The six spires of the temple represent the power of the priesthood. The three spires on the east side are a little higher than those on the west: they represent the Melchizedek, or &quot;higher priesthood&quot;, and the Aaronic, or &quot;preparatory priesthood&quot; respectively. The three spires on the east side represent the church&#x27;s First Presidency and the twelve smaller spires on those three represent the Twelve Apostles.
* Sun, moon, and stars – Around the temple there are several carved stones depicting the Sun, Moon, and stars which correspond respectively to the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms of glory in the afterlife. The sunstones have also been interpreted to represent God, the moonstones in different phases as representing different phases of life, and the starstones representing Jesus Christ. These symbols were drawn from the three lesser lights symbols in the Freemasonry practiced by many early church leaders in Nauvoo. Additionally, five-pointed stars have traditionally represented the five wounds of Christ (hands, feet, and side) and the five-pointed star with an elongated downward ray found on several LDS temples has been interpreted to represent Christ coming to Earth.

==Incidents==
===Bombings===
Two bombing incidents have damaged the temple. On April 10, 1910, a bomb at the nearby Hotel Utah (now the Joseph Smith Memorial Building) damaged the trumpet of the Moroni statue atop the temple. On November 14, 1962, the southeast door of the Salt Lake Temple was bombed. FBI agents state that the explosive had been wrapped around the door handles on the temple&#x27;s southeast entrance. The large wooden entrance doors were damaged by flying fragments of metal and glass. Damage to interior walls occurred 25 feet inside the temple, but damage to the interior was minor. Eleven exterior windows were shattered.

===1999 Salt Lake City tornado===

The temple suffered damage in 1999 when a tornado rated F2 on the Fujita Scale struck Salt Lake City. A wedding taking place at the time allowed a photographer to record video of the tornado as it passed near the temple, forcing the wedding party to shelter against the temple doors and pillars for protection from the wind and debris. They were not able to take shelter inside as the temple doors were locked. After being pelted with rain and hail, members of the wedding party surveyed the damage to the trees and surrounding buildings before resuming family photographs.

===2020 Salt Lake City earthquake===

On the morning of March 18, 2020, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck just outside Salt Lake City. Though most of the damage was outside the city, minor damage was inflicted on the temple. The trumpet of the Angel Moroni on top of the temple&#x27;s tallest spire was dislodged from the statue, and some stones from the smaller spires were displaced. No other damage to the temple was reported. The temple was early in its renovation process at the time, and the rest of the statue was removed the following May. Renovation procedures included an installation of a new statue on April 2, 2024.

==Interior images==

Below are several photographs from the interior of the temple. In response to a member obtaining unauthorized images of the interior of the temple, church leaders decided to release the book &quot;The House of the Lord&quot; in 1912, which contained authorized black-and-white photographs of the interior, some of which are shown below. The unauthorized photographs had been taken over several months the year before by a man who was repeatedly allowed to enter with his camera while the temple was closed by a temple gardener friend.
===Images of former interior elements===
Below are some elements of the temple have been removed during various renovations of the temple.

<text>Boomerang is an American cable television network owned by Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. It primarily features animated programming from the Warner Bros. Animation library (including Warner Bros. Cartoons and Hanna-Barbera productions among others).

Boomerang debuted in 1992 as a programming block on Cartoon Network, and was originally dedicated to classic animation. The block was eventually spun-off into its own separate network in 2000, and by the late 2000s, began airing more modern and contemporary programming, including reruns of Cartoon Network original series. A 2015 relaunch aimed to promote Boomerang as a &quot;second flagship&quot; brand alongside Cartoon Network, and saw the network produce its own original programming; with a focus on contemporary reboots of franchises such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. In 2017, as the cable network was losing coverage, Boomerang launched a standalone SVOD over-the-top streaming service, which operated until 2024.

, the Boomerang cable network is available to approximately 26,000,000 pay television households in the United States; down from its 2019 peak of 47,000,000 households.

==History==
===Background and early years===

The Turner Broadcasting System had built up an extensive catalogue of MGM and early Warner Bros. cartoons since the 1980s. The library made up much of the extensive children&#x27;s programming on TBS and TNT, which was phased out after the creation of the Cartoon Network on October 1, 1992. Boomerang was created as a new home for these and similar programming, originating as a programming block on Cartoon Network that launched on December 8, 1992 until October 3, 2004.

With Cartoon Network downplaying its archival programming in favor of newer original series, Turner launched the Boomerang cable channel on April 1, 2000.

===Relaunch===
On February 4, 2014, as part of the 2014 upfronts, it was announced that Boomerang would become an advertising-supported network, and that there were plans to expand the brand globally. In October of that year, a global rebranding was unveiled. The new branding was first launched in Latin America in late September, before arriving in the United States on January 19, 2015. As part of the expansion, Boomerang would introduce original programming for the first time, which would place a particular focus on the most well-known franchises from the Warner archives with an explicitly family-friendly approach. Turner executives described the changes as being an effort to grow Boomerang into a &quot;second flagship&quot; on par with the Cartoon Network.

On March 7, 2017, Boomerang announced the launch of its branded SVOD streaming service. The service would feature 5000+ titles from Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros, as well as exclusive original programming. The SVOD launched on April 11, 2017, and was available for either for $4.99 per month or $39.99 annually. New episodes and content were planned to be added to the service on a weekly basis. 

On November 13, 2018, Boomerang launched a channel on the VRV streaming service. That same year, the &quot;3rd Annual Shorty Social Good Awards&quot; nominated Boomerang and the &quot;Captain Planet&quot; Foundation for Best in Entertainment. 

In August 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it would be shutting down the standalone Boomerang service on September 30. Select content from the app moved to the Max streaming service and remaining Boomerang subscribers were converted to the app&#x27;s ad-free plan.

==Programming==

Boomerang&#x27;s cable network currently airs a mix of classic cartoons and contemporary re-imaginings of franchises from the Warner Bros. animation library, as well as reruns (and, on occasion, premieres and finales) of programming aired on Cartoon Network. It has also been used to burn off programs from Cartoon Network. As part of its 2015 relaunch, Boomerang previously produced its own original programs, including &quot;Wabbit&quot; (later re-titled &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; for its second season), &quot;Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!&quot;, and an animated adaptation of &quot;Bunnicula&quot;.

==Availability==
Boomerang-branded networks and blocks have been launched globally. As part of the brand&#x27;s 2015 relaunch, these branches were initially aligned as family co-viewing networks. Beginning in 2021, several of these outlets were re-aligned under the preschool-oriented Cartoonito brand (which would have its own relaunch that year).

<doc id="712507" wikidata="Q5428687" url="?curid=712507" title="Faction Paradox">
<text>Faction Paradox is a series of novels, audio stories, short story anthologies, and comics set in and around a &quot;War in Heaven&quot;, a history-spanning conflict between godlike &quot;Great Houses&quot; and their mysterious enemy. The series is named after a group originally created by author Lawrence Miles for BBC Books&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels.

==Overviews==
Originally a subplot in the Eighth Doctor Adventures, the War involves several characters and concepts evolved from the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; set-up. In several cases, the &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; series still features these groups, albeit with names changed for reasons both literary (most of the groups or items mentioned are described from different perspectives) and legal (the Faction and the Enemy are Miles&#x27;s creations, but other elements are not – thus the Great Houses are the Faction Paradox range&#x27;s equivalent to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s Time Lords). Faction Paradox themselves are &quot;not&quot; the enemy in this War, and play a neutral part, willing to act against both sides in their own interests. Miles has described them as &quot;a ritualistic time-travelling guerrilla organisation&quot;.

The semi-mythical founder of Faction Paradox is Grandfather Paradox, named after the grandfather paradox of time travel theory. Originally a member of the Great Houses himself, the Grandfather created a new group after he became frustrated with the ways of the Great Houses. Faction Paradox therefore takes a good deal of pleasure in irritating the Great Houses, and many of their traditions and rituals are aligned in direct opposition to the way the Great Houses do things. Their time machines are bigger on the inside, in much the same way as TARDISes are, and the familial titles its members use (e.g. &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Cousin&quot;) reference family units which the Great Houses lost when they became sterile.

Faction Paradox also take a perverse pride in causing time paradoxes (something that is against the laws of the Great Houses) and achieving impossible or absurd effects for their own sake. For instance, they typically wear ritual skull masks which are in fact the skulls of vampirised members of the Great Houses who, in the Great Houses&#x27; version of history, never existed. Their stronghold on Earth exists in a version of London, within what they call &quot;The Eleven-Day Empire&quot;, bought from the British government in 1752. In that year, the British Empire first adopted the Gregorian calendar, and in so doing had to correct their dating scheme by 11 days (2 September 1752 being followed by 14 September 1752). Faction Paradox claimed the missing 11 days as their base (building on the illogicity that only the numbering scheme changed and no days were actually &quot;missing&quot;).

One method of recruitment utilised by the Faction involves infecting others with the Paradox biodata virus, which warps the mind of the infected subject to share the Faction&#x27;s perspective. A key storyline in the Eighth Doctor&#x27;s adventures at this time involves the Faction manipulating the Doctor into changing his own history so that the Third Doctor not only regenerates &quot;ahead of schedule&quot; on the planet Dust, but also in a manner that allows him to be infected by a Paradox virus while his system is weakened by his regeneration. While the virus would still be too weak to affect the Doctor immediately, it would gain greater influence on him until the time of his eighth incarnation, at which point the Doctor would be converted to a Faction agent. Fortunately, the TARDIS was aware of this divergence from the timeline and took the infected timeline into itself, thus essentially preserving the timeline where the Doctor wasn&#x27;t infected even as the timeline where the Doctor becomes a Faction agent still had the potential to exist.

==Stories==
===Doctor Who (BBC Books)===
After a brief mention of Grandfather Paradox in the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Christmas on a Rational Planet&quot;, Faction Paradox and the War in Heaven made their debut in BBC Books&#x27; Eighth Doctor novels.

The most relevant books to the &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; universe are:
*&quot;Alien Bodies&quot; (Lawrence Miles, 1997)
*&quot;Unnatural History&quot; (Kate Orman and Jon Blum, 1999)
*&quot;Interference: Book One (Shock Tactic)&quot; (Lawrence Miles, 1999) - Featuring the Eighth and Third Doctors, Sam, Fitz, Sarah Jane, and K-9, this book shows Sam dealing with matters in her own life while also being an unwitting part, along with the Doctor, of a million-year old year conspiracy with universe-wide effects, and which draws in the Doctor not once, but twice, at different points in time
*&quot;Interference: Book Two (The Hour of the Geek)&quot; (Lawrence Miles, 1999) - Continuing the story of the previous book, the Doctor finds himself dealing with his enemy across time and space, getting caught between the results of cause and effect coming together. The book also marks Sam&#x27;s departure, the introduction of new companion Compassion, and culminates in an alternate regeneration for the Third Doctor.
*&quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (Paul Magrs, 1999)- Featureing the Eighth Doctor, Fitz, Compassion and Iris Wildthyme, the author described the novel as social realist.
*&quot;The Taking of Planet 5&quot; (Simon Bucher Jones and Mark Clapham, 1999) - Featuring the Eighth Doctor, Fitz and Compassion, it is partly a sequel to the television serial Image of the Fendahl. It features references to many elements from the Cthulhu Mythos stories of H. P. Lovecraft, in particular the Elder Things and their ancient Antarctic city from At the Mountains of Madness.
*&quot;The Shadows of Avalon&quot; (Paul Cornell, 2000)
*&quot;The Adventuress of Henrietta Street&quot; (Lawrence Miles, 2001)

Several other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels featured or referenced Faction Paradox, most notably &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot; (written by Stephen Cole and Peter Anghelides in 2000), &quot;The Quantum Archangel&quot; (written by Craig Hinton in 2001), and &quot;The Gallifrey Chronicles&quot; (written by Lance Parkin in 2005), but were contradicted or otherwise ignored in the &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; series.

===Faction Paradox (BBV)===
A series of full-cast audio dramas dubbed &quot;The Faction Paradox Protocols&quot; was produced by BBV between 2001 and 2004. All were written by Lawrence Miles. These stories centred on two Cousins of the Faction, Justine and Eliza. (Justine had previously featured in the BBC novel &quot;Alien Bodies&quot;, and Eliza appeared in &quot;Dead Romance&quot; as &quot;Christine Summerfield&quot;.) The first two stories were set in the Eleven-Day Empire; the second two in 18th century London; and the last two were split between Justine&#x27;s pre-Faction past and the Great Houses&#x27; prison facility. Although there were six releases and an ongoing story, each pair (usually released close together) formed a two-part story. In order they were:

*&quot;The Eleven-Day Empire&quot; (2001)
*&quot;The Shadow Play&quot; (2001)
*&quot;Sabbath Dei&quot; (2003)
*&quot;In the Year of the Cat&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Movers&quot; (2003)
*&quot;A Labyrinth of Histories&quot; (2004)

June 2021 saw the return to BBV of the series as audio downloads Also, a 5-minute video crossover with BBV&#x27;s &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot; series was released. Lawrence Miles said of these productions, &#x27;I no longer have full control over the copyright, but I strongly recommend that you don&#x27;t buy any Faction Paradox material from BBV.&#x27;

*&quot;Daylight Savings&quot; (video crossover with &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot;, James Hornby, 2021)
*&quot;Eternal Escape&quot; (James Hornby, 2021)
*&quot;Dionus&#x27;s War&quot;
**&quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot; (J.T. Mulholland, 2021)
**&quot;The Healer&#x27;s Sin&quot; (J.T. Mulholland, 2021)
**&quot;Me &amp; My Ghost&quot; (Bill Baggs, 2021)
*&quot;Sabbath and the King&quot; (Aristide Twain, 2021)
*&quot;The Confession of Brother Signet&quot; (Michael Gilroy-Sinclair, 2021)
*&quot;Hellscape&quot;
**&quot;Lucifer&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)
**&quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Sleep&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)
**&quot;Babylon&#x27;s Own Personal Hell&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)
**&quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)
**&quot;Unwanted Guest&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)
**&quot;Lilith Fades&quot; (Trevor Spencer, 2022)

On August 28 2023, BBV Productions continued, as promised, the Hellscape series as a Faction Paradox spin off with the first half of the audio series&#x27;s second season (titled The Lilium Saga) and a free episode (episode 5) of the video series Hellscape: MorningStar.

===Faction Paradox (Mad Norwegian Press)===
In 2002 Mad Norwegian Press published a multi-author faux-encyclopedia to the first 50 years of the War in Heaven, edited by Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles, as a companion to the BBV audios. After the success of &quot;The Book of the War&quot;, Mad Norwegian began publishing a &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; series of novels set in the same universe. These novels roam the ongoing War in Heaven; despite the series&#x27; name, the Faction and its members are not the focus, sometimes featuring only as minor characters, and sometimes not appearing at all. The books also featured characters from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels, including Chris Cwej and Compassion.

*&quot;The Book of the War&quot; (Lawrence Miles et al., 2002)
*&quot;This Town Will Never Let Us Go&quot; (Lawrence Miles, 2003)
*&quot;Of the City of the Saved...&quot; (Philip Purser-Hallard, 2004)
*&quot;Warlords of Utopia&quot; (Lance Parkin, 2004)
*&quot;Warring States&quot; (Mags L Halliday, 2005)
*&quot;Erasing Sherlock&quot; (Kelly Hale, 2006)

Mad Norwegian also republished the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Dead Romance&quot; as part of their &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; line in 2003.

===Faction Paradox (Image Comics)===

In 2003, the first two issues of a Faction Paradox comic were produced by Mad Norwegian and published by Image Comics. The series was subsequently cancelled. The comic was written by Lawrence Miles with art from Jim Calafiore and inks by Peter Palmiotti. It was set after the events of the War in Heaven, though due to its short run it did not give much detail on the post-War universe. It tied into events described in &quot;The Faction Paradox Protocols&quot;, &quot;The Book of the War&quot;, and &quot;The Adventuress of Henrietta Street&quot;.

===Faction Paradox (Magic Bullet)===
In 2004, Magic Bullet Productions, known for their &quot;Kaldor City&quot; audio dramas, obtained the license to produce further &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; audios, dubbed &quot;The True History of Faction Paradox&quot;. The narrative of this series continued from &quot;The Faction Paradox Protocols&quot;, although the first CD was also written to be accessible to newcomers. Like the BBV audios, these stories focused on Cousin Justine and Cousin Eliza, but the characters were recast.

The dramas in the series, released between 2005 and 2009, have featured guest stars including Julian Glover, Peter Miles, Philip Madoc and Gabriel Woolf. Woolf plays the ancient Egyptian god Sutekh, whom he had previously played in the 1975 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;. The six titles are:

*&quot;Coming To Dust&quot;
*&quot;The Ship of a Billion Years&quot;
*&quot;Body Politic&quot;
*&quot;Words from Nine Divinities&quot;
*&quot;Ozymandias&quot;
*&quot;The Judgment of Sutekh&quot;

===Faction Paradox (Random Static)===
In 2007, New Zealand-based publisher Random Static announced they would be publishing further &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; novels. What turned out to be the sole title of the new range was published in January 2008. The cover art, by Emma Weakley, won the Sir Julius Vogel Award for Best Artwork in 2009.
*&quot;Newtons Sleep&quot; (Daniel O&#x27;Mahony, 2008)

===Faction Paradox (Obverse Books)===

<text>Another Roadside Attraction is the first novel by Tom Robbins, published in 1971.

==Plot==

The novel is framed as a series of short entries rather than chapters. The writer, who remains anonymous at first, is being held captive by several agencies along with Amanda Ziller, the main subject of his report. Amanda was a member of a traveling circus that one day recruited the eccentric drummer John Paul Ziller, a once famous musician known for his exotic dress and odd mannerisms. Falling immediately in love, the two soon married and resigned from the troupe to live in an abandoned restaurant in Skagit County, Washington. John brings Mon Cul, his pet baboon, to stay with them. Amanda brings her toddler son, Thor. The couple decide to revive the restaurant as a hot dog stand and roadside zoo. Although they are both averse to keeping animals captive, they compromise by keeping a group of garter snakes native to San Francisco under the grounds of preservation, as well as a flea circus under the grounds that bugs are not technically animals. Also part of the zoo is a tsetse fly encased in amber. 

As the hot dog stand gains traction, a man who goes by the name of Marx Marvelous gets himself arrested for sneaking into a zoo and attempting to set a baboon free, which he reveals to have done because he knew it would attract the Zillers&#x27; attention. The couple bail him out of jail and hire him to help manage the restaurant. A man of science, Marvelous reveals to Amanda that he believes Christianity is on the verge of collapse and will soon transition to a new religion, with the Zillers playing some sort of key role.

During this time, the trio intermittently receive letters from John Paul&#x27;s friend Plucky Purcell, who explains that he has accidentally infiltrated a secret organization of Catholic assassins known as the Order of the Felicitate, which he accomplished by assuming the identity of a deceased monk he had stumbled upon. After spending several months at the monastery, he travels with the organization to the Vatican City, where an unexpected earthquake damages the catacombs in which he slept and inadvertently reveals the corpse of Jesus Christ, which had until then been stored underground in a sealed vault. Purcell takes advantage of the sudden chaos to sneak out of the city with the Corpse. He manages to ship it back to the Zillers&#x27; restaurant, arriving there himself shortly after.

The group spends several days pondering what to do with the Corpse. Purcell wishes to reveal it to the world, thus causing the collapse of Christianity and likely a large part of society as a whole. Marvelous wishes to blackmail high-ranking church and government officials in order to influence them to do more good in the world. Amanda wishes to give it a proper burial on Bow Wow mountain and nothing more. John Paul remains silent.

After taking a day to think separately about the issue, the group reconvenes to discover that the Felicitate, along with other government officials, have begun to close in on the restaurant. The following morning, Marx - who reveals himself as the writer - awakens to discover that Purcell and John Paul have fled, taking Mon Cul and the Corpse with them. While searching for clues, Marx and Amanda find a newspaper clipping which details the launch of a large weather balloon which would take a group of five baboons to the edge of space. Shortly thereafter, a government agent shows a report to the two which reveals that Purcell and John Paul had snuck onto the base carrying the balloon and had set the baboons free. Purcell was shot and killed while trying to flee, but John Paul, Mon Cul, and the Corpse all boarded the balloon and took off. The report concludes by saying that John Paul faced certain death within 24 hours due to the extreme exposure from the sun, after which his body, along with Mon Cul&#x27;s and the Corpse&#x27;s, would eventually disintegrate entirely.

Soon after, Amanda and Marx prepare to leave the restaurant. Amanda, now pregnant once more, leaves for unknown adventures, while Marvelous is taken by the head of the Felicitate to an unknown fate. Marx&#x27;s report concludes by saying he has given his entire manuscript to Amanda, and thus if it has survived the ordeal then it means Amanda is still alive.

==Technique and subject matter==
In this novel, the author uses nonlinear plot progression, sometimes in the tone of a first-person diary, to express his views on religion and other topics.

A major theme of the novel is the mummified corpse of Jesus Christ and Western Civilization&#x27;s belief and faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ. In his memoir, Robbins states that he wanted to question what would happen to Western Civilization if it could be demonstrated that Jesus had not in fact risen bodily from the dead.

==Development history==

In 1966, Doubleday&#x27;s West Coast Editor Luthor Nichols contacted Robbins to ask him to write a book on Northwest Art. Instead, Robbins told Nichols he wanted to write a novel and pitched the idea of what was to become &quot;Another Roadside Attraction&quot;.

In 1967 Robbins mailed off 30 pages of his novel to Nichols who sent them on to the New York office. The senior editors, holdovers from when Doubleday was a Roman Catholic publishing house, did not approve, but Nichols encouraged Robbins to keep writing. When he had 70 pages, Nichols tried them again on New York, but the senior editors were still unconvinced. It wasn&#x27;t until 1970 that Doubleday finally accepted the manuscript and in 1971 published 6,000 copies of &quot;Another Roadside Attraction&quot;.

In his memoir, Robbins states that he did not want to describe the sixties in this novel but to re-create them on the page, &quot;to mirror in style as well as content their mood, their palette, their extremes, their vibrations, their profundity, their silliness and whimsy.&quot; Robbins also said he used a collage technique—he skimmed media such as the underground press, KRAB radio program guides, broadsides, fliers for concerts to try and pluck out items that might capture a portrait of the period.

In the book a baboon is stolen from the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Shortly after publication someone did actually steal a baboon from the Zoo.

<doc id="712514" wikidata="Q5141549" url="?curid=712514" title="Coin magic">
<text>Coin magic is the manipulating of coins to entertain audiences. Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered close-up magic or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or &#x27;coin worker&#x27;) will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as card magic, as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this requires much practice to acquire.

==Elements==
Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic -- some are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (e.g. handkerchiefs, glasses) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object The basic skills of sleight of hand and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table.

==Sleights and tricks==

Some classic coin magic effects:
*Coin vanish - making a coin seemingly vanish.
*Coin production - making a coin seemingly appear.
*Transposition - making two coins switch places

Some classic coin magic plots:
*Chink-a-chink - A bare-handed Matrix.
*Coins Across - The magical transfer of multiple coins from one hand to another. This effect is generally performed one coin at a time. 
*Coin Bite - Taking a bite out of a coin then visually restoring it right in front of the spectator.
*Coins Through Table - Coins penetrate through the surface of the table.
*Coin to Bottle - A coin is slammed into a sealed bottle.
*Coins to Glass - Similar to coins across - coins transfer from one hand to a glass.
*Matrix - A teleportation illusion of four coins moving invisibly under the cover of four playing cards.
*Miser&#x27;s Dream - Grabbing multiple coins from thin air. Popularized by Thomas Nelson Downs, who would drop coin after coin into a borrowed top hat.
*Spellbound - Visually changing one coin into another at the tip of the fingers, while only showing one coin at all times.
*Tenkai Pennies - A two coin routine where one coin travels from one hand to the other.
*Three fly - A coins across type effect involving three coins, &quot;visually&quot; transferring from one hand to another at the eye or chest level.

A sampling of coin sleights and moves:
*Palming - A form of concealment.
*Sleeving - A form of vanishing a coin.
*Lapping - A form of ditching a coin.
*The French Drop - a retention of vision coin vanish involving the Passing of a coin from one hand to the other than making it disappear.
*The Muscle Pass - Shooting a coin from one hand to the other This can be done in such a way that can make the coin look as if it is defying gravity

==Coin magicians==
Some magicians widely known for coin magic include:
* Thomas Nelson Downs (considered, along with J.B. Bobo, one of the magicians key to the development and teaching of modern coin magic)
* J.B. Bobo (author of Modern Coin Magic, a core reference and starting point for coin magicians)
* Tony Slydini (a well-known magician whose style of magic transformed close-up magic including his impressive coin routines)
* Dai Vernon (a true innovator and a legend in close-up magic, also known as The Professor)
* Ed Marlo
* David Roth (most important developer of coin magic in the twentieth century and the inventor of the standard plots common in current coin magic)
* Larry Jennings
* Michael Ammar (one of the most prolific publishers and teachers, an experienced all around magician, including coin work)
* Dean Dill (coin magician and inventor who has appeared on television and also works as a barber)
* Michael Vincent
* Shoot Ogawa (Last Vegas restaurant performer known for highly stylized, high-difficulty, impressive coin magic)
* Apollo Robbins (contemporary of Shoot Ogawa and co-contributor to a number of coin teaching materials -- also a well-known pickpocket artist)
* David Stone (a talented performer and a teacher of fast-paced, flashy coin magic)
* Rocco Silano (student of Slydini -- one of the best utilizers of the &quot;sleeving&quot; technique)
* Jay Sankey (inventor and a teacher of close-up magic from Canada)
* Rich Ferguson (author of Chip Tricks, a magician and a mentalist who has authored various magic instructional videos)
* Luis Piedrahita
* Michael Rubinstein
* Mike Gallo
* Paul Cummins
* Ryan Hayashi

==Performance==
Although some coin magic use gimmicks (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to amplify the effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks.

==In literature==
Canadian novelist Robertson Davies devotes a good part of his &quot;Deptford Trilogy&quot; to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-mâché automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, World of Wonders, details his life and career.

In the Neil Gaiman novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, the main character, Shadow, is experienced in coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book.

In the Dean Koontz novel &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot;, a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects.

In Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series of novels, the gunslinger Roland Deschain uses the coin roll, albeit substituting a bullet, to induce a hypnotic state in those concentrating on the object&#x27;s movement across his knuckles.

Thieves, wizards, and jesters, in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. Rolling a coin across the knuckles (coin roll) is a popular image. Silk in David Eddings&#x27;s &quot;Belgariad&quot;, and Mat Cauthon and Thom Merrilin in Robert Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; do this frequently. Johnny Depp&#x27;s whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin rolls in the end of Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, Vila Restal in the BBC science fiction television program &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

<text>Philip Purser-Hallard (born 1971 as Philip Hallard) is a fantasy, science fiction and crime author described by the British Fantasy Society as &quot;the best kept secret in British genre writing&quot;.

His &quot;Devices Trilogy&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Pendragon Protocol&quot;, is an urban fantasy thriller series which combines Arthurian myth with issues of modern British politics and identity. The British Fantasy Society said that the first novel&#x27;s &quot;writing is crisp and clever, the plotting devoid of flab and the cast of characters appealing, interesting and consistent&quot;, and that it was based on &quot;that rarest of fantasy beasts – an original idea&quot;. 

He has a long association with Doctor Who licensed fiction. From 2015 he is the editor of &quot;The Black Archive&quot;, a series of book-length critical studies of individual &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes and stories. The series is published by Obverse Books, and features contributions from Simon Bucher-Jones, Simon Guerrier, Kate Orman and others. Purser-Hallard has written or contributed to six of the books. He has also written short stories and four novels featuring Sherlock Holmes.

Purser-Hallard received his doctorate in English literature at Oxford University. His DPhil thesis, entitled &#x27;The Relationship Between Creator and Creature in Science Fiction&#x27;, examined how British and American science fiction of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries explored the relationship between humanity and a putative creating deity through stories about the creation of sentient individuals by scientists, working from Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; through to recent authors like Bruce Sterling, William Gibson and Dan Simmons. He also has interests in eschatological science fiction, as seen in his &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; novel, &quot;Of the City of the Saved&quot;.

Purser-Hallard has given three talks at the liberal Christian Greenbelt festival, all on the intersections of science fiction and religious themes. Between 2006 and 2009 he wrote a regular column on science fiction and faith for Surefish, the ISP and webzine arm of Christian Aid. From 2009 to 2012 he published regular 140-character microfictions on Twitter, under the username &quot;trapphic&quot;.

His brother Nick Hallard, an artist, provided endpieces for the &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; collection and unofficial illustrations for Purser-Hallard&#x27;s &quot;Of the City of the Saved...&quot; web pages.

<text>Of the City of the Saved... is an original novel by Philip Purser-Hallard set in the Faction Paradox universe. Laura Tobin, who first appeared in the BBC Doctor Who books, is a major character in the novel.

The full title, as given on the title page, is &quot;Of the City of the Saved... of its diverse citizenry and of its sundry divinities, with a disquisition on the protocols of history&quot;. The novel won Best Book in the 2004 Jade Pagoda awards, voted on by members of a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book mailing list. It has been described as &quot;a stunning debut from Purser-Hallard and easily one of the best Doctor Who-related original novels published to date&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; calls it &quot;ambitious&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
Beyond the end of the universe exists The City of the Saved, an urban sprawl the size of a galaxy. Within it every human being that ever lived, from the first australopithecine to the last posthuman, has been inexplicably resurrected. For three hundred years, the uncountable inhabitants have enjoyed their unaging and invulnerable second lives. But now, the unthinkable has happened. Someone has been murdered.

==Continuity==
The City of the Saved was introduced in &quot;The Book of the War&quot; and is the setting of Purser-Hallard&#x27;s story in the Obverse Books anthology &quot;A Romance in Twelve Parts&quot;. A series of anthologies set in the City and edited by Purser-Hallard has been published by Obverse Books since 2012.

==Cultural references==
Among others, the science fiction author Philip K. Dick and the Roman Emperor Claudius appear as characters in the novel. Various fictional characters appear as artificial constructs within the City, including Sherlock Holmes and Don Juan DeMarco.

<doc id="712523" wikidata="Q7719340" url="?curid=712523" title="The Book of the War">
<text>The Book of the War is a hypertext multi-author novel presented in the form of an encyclopedia of the first 50 years of the War in the Faction Paradox universe based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe. The book was edited by Lawrence Miles, and written by Miles, Simon Bucher-Jones, Daniel O&#x27;Mahony, Ian McIntire, Mags L. Halliday, Helen Fayle, Philip Purser-Hallard, Kelly Hale, Jonathan Dennis, and Mark Clapham.

==Content==

Although various plot threads can be found in the book, its real value lies in the wealth of ideas on display. It&#x27;s primarily a guide to many of the important factions involved in the War in Heaven. These include Faction Paradox itself, the Great Houses, the Celestis, the Remote, and Posthumanity. A number of hints about the mysterious Enemy against whom the Great Houses at fighting are scattered through the text, but nothing conclusive. The book details many individuals, events, technologies, and concepts related to the War.

The book makes references to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels &quot;Alien Bodies&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Taking of Planet 5&quot;, and &quot;The Shadows of Avalon&quot;, and it features the characters Compassion and Chris Cwej who first appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. A number of other parallels with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; characters and concepts can be found, but these links are not explicit. No familiarity with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is required to appreciate &quot;The Book of the War&quot;.

Characters and settings from &quot;The Book of the War&quot; appear in later &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; novels including &quot;Of the City of the Saved...&quot;, &quot;Warring States&quot; and &quot;Newtons Sleep&quot;, and the short story anthology &quot;A Romance in Twelve Parts&quot;.

<text>Temple Square is a complex, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in the center of Salt Lake City, Utah. The usage of the name has gradually changed to include several other church facilities that are immediately adjacent to Temple Square. Contained within Temple Square are the Salt Lake Temple, Salt Lake Tabernacle, Salt Lake Assembly Hall, the Seagull Monument, and two visitors&#x27; centers. The square was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1964, recognizing the Mormon achievement in the settlement of Utah.

==History==


In 1847, when Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, president Brigham Young selected a plot of the desert ground, initially referred to as &quot;Temple Block,&quot; and proclaimed, &quot;Here we will build a temple to our God.&quot; When the city was surveyed, the block enclosing that location was designated for the temple, and became known as Temple Square. Temple Square is surrounded by a 15-foot wall that was built shortly after the block was so designated.

The square also became the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other buildings were built on the plot, including a tabernacle (prior to the one occupying Temple Square today) and Endowment House, both of which were later torn down. The Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, was built in 1867 to accommodate the church&#x27;s general conferences, with a seating capacity of 8,000. Another church building, the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, was later built with a seating capacity of 2,000.

As the church has grown, its headquarters have expanded into the surrounding area. In 1917, an administration building was built on the block east of the temple and in 1972, the twenty-eight story LDS Church Office Building, which was, for many years, the tallest building in the state of Utah. The Hotel Utah, another building on this block, was remodeled in 1995 as additional office space and a large film theater and renamed the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. In 2000, the church purchased the section of Main Street between this block and Temple Square and connected the two blocks with a plaza called the Main Street Plaza. In 2000, the church completed a new, 21,000 seat Conference Center on the block north of Temple Square.

In 2020, many of the buildings on and around Temple Square were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the multi-year renovation project.

==Modern usage==
===Tourism===
Attracting an estimate of 5-plus million visitors a year, Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Utah. The LDS Church does not provide exact statistical data on the number of visits to Temple Square, but visitation is estimated to similar to that of the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone National Park. Visitation to Utah&#x27;s five national parks—Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, and Arches—had a combined total of approximately 9 million visitors in 2022.

===General Conference===
===Lighting===
The grounds, as well as the Gardens at Temple Square, often host concerts and other events. During the Christmas holiday season, approximately 100,000 Christmas lights sparkle from trees and shrubs around Temple Square each evening until 10 pm. The lighting of Temple Square is a popular event, usually attended by more than 10,000 people.

===Other uses===
The multiple gates to Temple Square are popular places for critics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—mainly former members and activist evangelical ministers—to picket and hand out tracts and literature critical of the church. They are also well-known locations for street musicians to perform, especially during the holiday season.

===Street directions===
Temple Square serves as the center point for all street addresses in Salt Lake City. The streets in Salt Lake follow a grid pattern which deviate out from the southeast corner of Temple Square.

==Sites==

===Salt Lake Temple===

The Salt Lake Temple is the largest and best-known of the Church&#x27;s operating temples. It is the sixth temple built by the church since its founding, and the fourth operating temple built following the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois.

===North and South Visitors&#x27; Centers===
Beginning in 1963, two visitors&#x27; centers, called the North Visitors&#x27; Center and the South Visitors&#x27; Center, were constructed on temple square. The North Visitors&#x27; Center was built first and featured a replica of the &quot;Christus&quot;. The &quot;Christus&quot; was in a room called the Rotunda with large windows, and a domed ceiling painted with heavenly bodies meant to reflect the sky on April 6, 1830, the day that the Church was founded. The visitors&#x27; centers and grounds are staffed by full-time sister missionaries and senior missionary couples exclusively; no single male missionaries are called to serve on Temple Square. The sister missionaries serving on Temple Square are from around the world, speaking enough languages to cater to the majority of visitors. Beginning with the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the sister missionaries have been wearing tags with the national flags of their home country along with their missionary name tags.

On April 19, 2019, church leaders announced that the South Visitors&#x27; Center will be demolished as part of a massive renovation project that will begin December 29, 2019. Two smaller visitors&#x27; pavilions will take its place. On June 10, 2021, it was announced that the North Visitors&#x27; Center would be demolished as well. It will be replaced by a garden designed as contemplative space.

===Conference and assembly buildings===
There are three large assembly buildings housed on Temple Square. The smallest of the three is the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, which seats approximately 2,000 and is on the southwest corner of Temple Square. The Assembly Hall is a Victorian Gothic congregation hall, with a cruciform layout of the interior that is complemented by Stars of David circumscribed high above each entrance, which symbolize the gathering of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Construction of the hall began on August 11, 1877, and was completed in 1882. It is just south of the Salt Lake Tabernacle and across from the South Visitor Center near the South Gate. Upon entering Temple Square from the south, the Assembly Hall can be seen to the left (west). The Assembly Hall hosts occasional free weekend music concerts and is filled as overflow for the church&#x27;s twice-a-year general conferences.

The second structure is the Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square. The Tabernacle was built between 1864 and 1867 with an overall seating capacity of 8,000, including the choir area and gallery. In March 2007, the Tabernacle was rededicated after extensive renovations and restorations were completed. Spacing between the pews was substantially increased, resulting in a reduced overall seating capacity. The Tabernacle was rededicated at the Saturday afternoon session of the church&#x27;s 177th Annual General Conference. In addition to housing the choir, the Tabernacle is also used for other religious and cultural events.

The largest and most recently built assembly building is the LDS Conference Center. With a capacity of over 21,000, it is used primarily for the Church&#x27;s general conferences as well as for concerts and other cultural events. The Conference Center was completed in 2000. Attached on the northwest corner of the Conference Center is the Conference Center Theater, an 850-seat theater for dramatic presentations, such as &quot;Savior of the World&quot;, as well as concerts and other events.

===Museums and libraries===

====FamilySearch Library====

On the block west of Temple Square, the FamilySearch Library is the largest genealogical library in the world and is open to the general public at no charge. The library holds genealogical records for over 110 countries, territories, and possessions. Its collections include over 2.4 million rolls of microfilmed genealogical records; 742,000 microfiche; 310,000 books, serials, and other formats; 4,500 periodicals; and 700 electronic resources.

====Church History Museum====

On the block west of Temple Square adjacent to the Family History Library, the Church History Museum houses collections of Latter-day Saint art and artifacts. The Museum houses permanent exhibits as well as playing host to temporary exhibits throughout the year. Past exhibits have included the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America, featuring 23 paintings by Norman Rockwell; displays and artwork from artist Arnold Friberg; and themed historical displays depicting church events.
====Church History Library====

On the block northeast of Temple Square and east of the Conference Center is the Church History Library, where the historical records of the Church are stored. The Library is free to patrons, who can come use a large collection of books, manuscripts, and photographs. Senior missionaries provide tours of the public areas of the Library. Patrons can also view a video explaining the mission and purpose of the Library.

<doc id="712542" wikidata="Q202424" url="?curid=712542" title="Spyridon Louis">
<text>Spyridon Louis ( , sometimes transliterated &quot;Spiridon Loues&quot;; 12 January 1873 – 26 March 1940), commonly known as Spyros Louis (Σπύρος Λούης), was a Greek water carrier who won the first modern-day Olympic marathon at the 1896 Summer Olympics. Following his victory, he was celebrated as a national hero.

A former soldier, Louis was encouraged to try out for the Olympics by his former commanding officer. After progressing through qualifying, he went on to win the inaugural Olympic marathon after placing first among seventeen competitors. Louis later became a police officer and a farmer. Outside of his athletics career, Louis was arrested for forgery, of which he was acquitted after spending a year in jail.

==Early life==
Spyridon Louis was born in the town of Marousi, north of Athens, into a poor family. Louis&#x27;s father sold mineral water in Athens, which at the time lacked a central water supply, and Spyridon helped him by transporting it.

==Olympic preparation==
After Pierre de Coubertin&#x27;s decision in 1894 to revive the Olympic Games, preparations were made to organise the first modern Olympics in Athens. One of the races would be the marathon, an event which had never been held before. It had been suggested by Frenchman Michel Bréal, who was inspired by the legend of the messenger Pheidippides, who had run from Marathon to Athens to announce the Athenian victory in the Battle of Marathon—and then dropped dead.

The Greeks were very enthusiastic about this new event and decided to hold qualifiers for the marathon. These races were started by Colonel Papadiamantopoulos, whom Louis previously served under in the military. The first qualifying race—the first ever marathon race—was held on 22 March, and was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours, 18 minutes. Louis participated in the second qualifying race, two weeks later, and placed fifth. Papadiamantopoulos, who knew of Louis&#x27;s talent in running, had convinced him to try out.

The Olympic marathon was run on 10 April (or 29 March by the Julian calendar then in use in Greece). The Greek public had been very enthusiastic about the Games, but were disappointed in the fact that no track and field event had yet been won by a Greek competitor. The victory in the discus throw, a classical Greek event, by the American Robert Garrett had been particularly painful. Because of its close connection with Greek history, the public yearned for the marathon to be won by one of their countrymen.

==Marathon race==
In Marathon, Colonel Papadiamantopoulos gave the starting signal for the small field, consisting of seventeen athletes, thirteen of them representing Greece. The early leader of the race, which led over dusty dirt roads along which throngs of Greeks had gathered to watch, was the Frenchman Albin Lermusiaux, who had placed third in the 1500 metres prior to the marathon. In the town of Pikermi, Louis is said to have made a stop at a local inn to drink a glass of wine. (Louis&#x27;s grandson, also Spyridon Louis, has stated that this is incorrect; that his grandfather&#x27;s girlfriend gave him half an orange and shortly afterwards he &quot;got a glass of cognac from his future father-in-law.&quot;) After asking for the advantage of the other runners, he confidently declared he would overtake them all before the end.

After 26 km, Lermusiaux was exhausted and abandoned the race. The lead was taken over by Edwin Flack, an Australian who won the 800 and 1500 m races. Louis slowly closed in on Flack. The Australian, not used to running long distances, collapsed a few kilometers onwards, giving Louis the lead.

During the race, there was tension among the Greek spectators when Flack was in first place. However, when news was delivered to the fans that Louis overtook the lead, the cry &quot;Hellene, Hellene!&quot; was taken up by rapturous spectators. Louis was greeted with cheers after entering the Panathenaic Stadium for the final part of the marathon. Louis ran with Crown Prince Constantine and Prince George of Greece during the last lap, finishing with a time of 2:58:50. Louis&#x27;s victory set off wild celebrations, as described in the official report of the Games:

Here the Olympionic Victor was received with full honour; the King rose from his seat and congratulated him most warmly on his success. Some of the King&#x27;s aides-de-camp, and several members of the Committee went so far as to kiss and embrace the victor, who finally was carried in triumph to the retiring room under the vaulted entrance. The scene witnessed then inside the Stadion cannot be easily described, even strangers were carried away by the general enthusiasm.

Adding to the celebrations, two more Greek runners entered the stadium to finish in second and third place. Third place finisher Spyridon Belokas was later found to have covered part of the course by carriage and was disqualified; third place was awarded to the Hungarian Gyula Kellner.

==After the Olympics==
After his victory, Louis received gifts from many countrymen, ranging from jewellery to a lifelong free shave at a barber shop. It is unknown whether he accepted all these gifts, although he did take back home the carriage he had asked of the king. After the Olympics, Louis ended his athletic career to become a farmer and a police officer.
In 1926, Louis was arrested on charges of falsifying military documents and was imprisoned. After spending more than a year in jail, he was acquitted.

His last public appearance came in 1936, when he was invited to be a guest of honour by the organizers of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. After bearing the standard of the Greek team during the opening ceremonies, he was received by Adolf Hitler and offered him an olive branch from Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, as a symbol of peace. Louis recalled the moments after his victory: &quot;That hour was something unimaginable and it still appears to me in my memory like a dream … Twigs and flowers were raining down on me. Everybody was calling out my name and throwing their hats in the air ...&quot;

Several months before the Italian invasion of Greece, Louis died. In Greece, various sports establishments are named after him. These include the Olympic Stadium of Athens where the 2004 Summer Olympics were held, as well as the road outside the stadium.

The Jayne Mansfield movie &quot;It Happened in Athens&quot; is a heavily fictionalized take on Louis and the marathon, and his story is featured in the 1984 TV miniseries &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;. The expression &#x27;to become Louis&#x27; () is used in Greece as a metaphor meaning &quot;tο disappear by running fast&quot;.

==Breal&#x27;s Silver Cup==
The silver cup given to Louis at the first modern Olympic Games staged in Athens in 1896, was sold for £541,250 ($860,000) in London during a Christie&#x27;s auction on 18 April 2012. The trophy, with a height of six inches, broke the auction record for Olympic memorabilia. The item was sold on the day Britain marked the 100 days&#x27; countdown to the 2012 London Olympics. Christie&#x27;s called the auction &quot;heated&quot; and involved six bidders. The auctioneer later confirmed the buyer was the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.

The cup is displayed at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, a project of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, fulfilling the commitment of the foundation to make it available to the public and to share it with everyone, upon the project&#x27;s completion. During the development of the project, the cup was temporarily displayed at the Acropolis Museum of Athens and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, during a period that coincided with the International Marathon of Lausanne.

<text>Patsy Matsu Mink ( Takemoto; , December 6, 1927 – September 28, 2002) was an American attorney and politician from the U.S. state of Hawaii. She served in the United States House of Representatives for 24 years as a member of the Democratic Party, initially from 1965 to 1977, and again from 1990 until her death in 2002. She was the first woman of color and the first Asian-American woman elected to Congress, and is known for her work on legislation advancing women&#x27;s rights and education.

Mink was a third-generation Japanese American, having been born and raised on the island of Maui. After graduating as valedictorian of the Maui High School class in 1944, she attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa for two years and subsequently enrolled at the University of Nebraska, where she experienced racism and worked to have segregation policies eliminated. After illness forced her to return to Hawaii to complete her studies there, she applied to 12 medical schools to continue her education but was rejected by all of them. Following a suggestion by her employer, she opted to study law and was accepted at the University of Chicago Law School in 1948. While there, she met and married a graduate student in geology, John Francis Mink. When they graduated in 1951, Patsy Mink was unable to find employment and after the birth of their daughter in 1952, the couple moved to Hawaii.

When she was refused the right to take the bar examination, due to the loss of her Hawaiian territorial residency upon marriage, Mink challenged the statute. Though she won the right to take the test and passed the examination, she could not find public or private employment because she was married and had a child. Mink&#x27;s father helped her open her own practice in 1953 and around the same time she became a member of the Democratic Party. Hoping to work legislatively to change discriminatory customs through law, she worked as an attorney for the Hawaiian territorial legislature in 1955. The following year, she ran for a seat in the territorial House of Representatives. Winning the race, she became the first Japanese-American woman to serve in the territorial House and two years later, the first woman to serve in the territorial Senate, when she won her campaign for the upper house. In 1960, Mink gained national attention when she spoke in favor of the civil rights platform at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. In 1962 she was elected to the new Hawaii State Senate becoming the first Asian-American Woman to be elected and serve in a state legislature in the United States.

In 1964, Mink ran for federal office and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She served a total of 12 terms (24 years), split between representing Hawaii&#x27;s at-large congressional district from 1965 to 1977 and second congressional district from 1990 to 2002. While in Congress in the late 1960s, she introduced the first comprehensive initiatives under the Early Childhood Education Act, which included the first federal child-care bill and worked on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In 1970, she became the first person to oppose a Supreme Court nominee on the basis of discrimination against women. Mink initiated a lawsuit which led to significant changes to presidential authority under the Freedom of Information Act in 1971. In 1972, she co-authored the Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act, later renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act in 2002.

Mink was the first East Asian-American woman to seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. She ran in the 1972 election, entering the Oregon primary as an anti-war candidate. She was the federal Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs from 1977 to 1979. From 1980 to 1982, Mink served as the president of Americans for Democratic Action and then returned to Honolulu, where she was elected to the Honolulu City Council, which she chaired until 1985. In 1990, she was again elected to the U.S. House, serving until her death in 2002.

==Family background==
Patsy Matsu Takemoto was born on December 6, 1927, at the sugar plantation camp, Hāmākua Poko, near Paia, on the island of Maui. She was a &quot;sansei&quot;, or third-generation descendant of Japanese immigrants. Her mother, Mitama Tateyama, was a homemaker, and the daughter of Gojiro Tateyama and Tsuru Wakashige. Their family, which had 11 children, lived in a shack by the Waikamoi Stream. William Pogue, Gojiro&#x27;s employer, arranged to have Tateyama&#x27;s daughters educated at the Maunaolu Seminary, a boarding school for Christian girls located in the town of Makawao.

Takemoto&#x27;s maternal grandparents were both born in the Empire of Japan during the 19th century. Gojiro Tateyama arrived in the Territory of Hawaii late in the century, and was employed on a sugarcane plantation. He later moved to Maui, where he was initially employed as a worker for the East Maui Irrigation Company. Subsequently, he was employed as a store manager and filling station employee. He also delivered mail throughout the backcountry of Maui.

Her father, Suematsu Takemoto, was a civil engineer. He graduated from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in 1922, the first Japanese American to graduate from the University of Hawaii with a degree in civil engineering. For several years, he was the only Japanese-American civil engineer working at the sugar plantation in Maui. Suematsu was passed over for promotion to chief engineer several times during his career, the positions instead being offered to mostly white Americans. He resigned his local position in 1945 in the aftermath of World War II, and moved to Honolulu with his family, where he established his own land surveying company.

==Early years and education==
Takemoto began her education at the Hāmākua Poko Grammar School when she was four and then transferred in 4th grade to the Kaunoa English Standard School a mostly-white school attended only by students who could speak English and pass the entrance examination. She felt isolated and found the atmosphere unfriendly. She entered Maui High School one year before Honolulu was attacked by Japan. Despite the local Japanese being treated as if they were enemies, Takemoto ran for and won her first election, becoming student body president in her senior year. She was the first girl to serve as president of the student body and graduated as class valedictorian in 1944.
Takemoto moved to Honolulu where she attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa with medical school and a career in medicine her ultimate goal. During her sophomore year, she was elected president of the Pre-Medical Students Club and was selected as a member of the varsity debate team. In 1946, she decided to move to the mainland and spent one semester enrolled at Wilson College, a small women&#x27;s college in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Unsatisfied with the school, Takemoto transferred to the University of Nebraska. The university had a long-standing racial segregation policy whereby students of color lived in different dormitories from the white students. This angered Takemoto, and she organized and created a coalition of students, parents, administrators, employees, alumni, sponsoring businesses and corporations. She was elected president of the Unaffiliated Students of the University of Nebraska, a &quot;separate&quot; student government for non-white students who were prevented from joining fraternities, sororities, and regular dormitories. Takemoto and her coalition successfully lobbied to end the university&#x27;s segregation policies the same year.

Although her campaign was successful, in 1947 Takemoto experienced a serious thyroid condition that required surgery and moved back to Honolulu to recover and finish her final year of college at the University of Hawaii. In 1948, she earned bachelor&#x27;s degrees in zoology and chemistry from the university. She began applying to medical schools, but none of the dozen schools to which she applied would accept her because she was a woman, especially as they were receiving large numbers of applications from returning veterans. She briefly worked as a typist at Hickam Air Force Base and then went to work at the Honolulu Academy of Arts. Her supervisor there, Jessie Purdy Restarick, encouraged her to consider a career in law.

Takemoto applied to both Columbia University and the University of Chicago Law School in the summer of 1948. Columbia rejected her outright, as the term was starting within months. The University of Chicago admitted her as a foreign student and there was only one other woman in her class. Although she had a difficult time adjusting to the harsh winters and found her courses tedious, Takemoto became a popular figure at the International House. While playing bridge there one evening, she met John Francis Mink, a former U.S. Air Force navigator and World War II veteran, who was enrolled in geology classes. Against her parents&#x27; wishes, she and Mink married in January 1951, six months after meeting. That spring, she obtained her Juris Doctor degree and John graduated as well, with a master&#x27;s degree in geology.

==Early career==
===Law===
Unable to find work as a married, female, Asian-American attorney, Mink returned to her student job at the University of Chicago Law School library while her husband found work immediately with the United States Steel Corporation. In 1952, she gave birth to daughter Gwendolyn (Wendy), who later became an educator and prominent author on law, poverty, and women&#x27;s issues. In August the family decided to move to Hawaii where John found work with the Hawaiian Sugar Planters&#x27; Association. To practice law, Mink needed to pass her bar examination, but when she applied her residency was questioned. The territorial law, in force at the time regarding married women, had removed her Hawaiian residency, making her a resident of her husband&#x27;s state. Proving that she had never resided in her husband&#x27;s home state of Pennsylvania, she challenged the territorial law as sexist. Hawaii&#x27;s attorney general ruled in her favor and allowed her to take the examination as a Hawaii resident. Passing the test, Mink became &quot;the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii&quot;.
Despite passing the bar exam in June 1953, Mink continued to face discrimination as she sought employment as an attorney. No firms in the private or public sector, even those headed by Japanese Americans, were willing to hire a married woman with a child. With the help of her father, she established a private firm and began teaching law courses at the University of Hawaii to earn money while she built her practice. With the opening of her firm, Mink became the first Asian-American woman to practice law in the Hawaiian territory. Her firm took cases in criminal and family law, which other firms typically avoided. She began to be active in politics and founded the Everyman Organization, a group that served as the hub of the Young Democrats club on Oahu. She was elected &quot;chairman of the territory-wide Young Democrats&quot;, which according to Esther K. Arinaga and Renee E. Ojiri was &quot;a group that would wield a remarkable influence over Hawaiian politics for several decades&quot;.

===State and territorial politics===
In 1954, Mink worked on the congressional campaign of John A. Burns, though he lost the race. The following year, she worked as staff attorney during the 1955 legislative session and drafted statutes, while observing the inner-workings of the legislature. As the Territory of Hawaii debated statehood in 1956, Mink was elected to the Hawaiian Territorial Legislature representing the Fifth District in the territorial House of Representatives. Surprising the Democratic party leadership with her win, she became the first woman with Japanese ancestry to serve in the territorial House. Two years later, she was the first woman to serve in the territorial Senate. In 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state of the Union and Mink ran in the Democratic primary for the state&#x27;s at-large U.S. congressional seat. She was defeated by Territorial Senator Daniel Inouye. From 1962 to 1964, Mink served in the Hawaii State Senate.
During her time in the territorial legislature, Mink was known for her liberal positions and independent decision-making. On her first day in office as a congresswoman in 1955, she submitted a successful resolution protesting British nuclear testing in the Pacific. Dealing with a broad spectrum of socio-economic issues, she worked on legislation covering education, employment, housing, poverty, and taxation. She authored a bill in 1957 to grant &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot;, regardless of gender, and was a staunch supporter of improving education, supporting legislation to increase per capita spending to better provide for children. In 1960, Mink became vice-president of the National Young Democratic Clubs of America and worked on the Democratic National Convention&#x27;s Platform Committee drafting team. That year at the national convention in Los Angeles, she gained recognition when she spoke on the party&#x27;s position in regard to civil rights. She urged that equal opportunity and equal protection be afforded to all Americans. Motions to restrict the civil rights platform made by North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin were defeated and a platform to ensure equal rights and equal protection under the law to all citizens passed with the approval of two-thirds of the party.

== Federal politics ==
===U.S. Representative (1965–1977)===
Deciding to vie for a federal seat, Mink campaigned and won a post in the U.S. House. As a result, she became the first woman from Hawaii elected to Congress, the first woman of color elected to the House, the &quot;youngest member from the youngest state, as well as the first Japanese-American woman member in Congress&quot;. Serving six consecutive terms, she was in office from 1965 to 1977. Her independent nature continued to guide her decisions and she focused on issues that had been important to her in the Hawaiian legislature, such as children, education, and gender equality. Mink supported the Great Society programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson, though she was openly critical of the Vietnam War.

Seeking and attaining a post on the Committee on Education and Labor, on which she would serve throughout her first tenure (1965–1977), Mink introduced in the late 1960s the first comprehensive initiatives under the Early Childhood Education Act, which included the first federal child-care bill and bills establishing bilingual education, Head Start, school lunch programs, special education, student loans, and teacher sabbaticals. She also worked on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and bills promoting adult education, Asian studies, career guidance programs, and vocational education. Her day-care bill proposed in 1967, was the first bill of its kind to pass both houses of Congress. Passed in 1971, the bill was vetoed by President Richard Nixon. In her second term, during the 90th Congress, Mink was appointed to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.

In 1970, Mink became the first Democratic woman to deliver a State of the Union response and only the second woman to respond to the address. That year, she was the first witness to testify against President Nixon&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee George Harrold Carswell. In her testimony, she cited his refusal to hear the case brought to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals regarding Ida Phillips&#x27; employment discrimination case. Phillips had been denied a position because she was a woman with children and Mink&#x27;s objection highlighted, for the first time in an evaluation of a court nominee, the inequalities faced by working women. Carswell would eventually be rejected by the Senate. Harry Blackmun, who wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, would later be confirmed instead.

Mink sued the Environmental Protection Agency in 1971, to obtain copies of documents that were being withheld by Nixon&#x27;s office with regard to nuclear testing on Amchitka Island. Believing that under the Freedom of Information Act agency reports connected to the test should be released, she led 32 congress members in the attempt to secure the reports. The District Court ruled that the documents &quot;were exempt from compelled disclosure&quot; and the test was performed in November 1971. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the lower court ruling that an &quot;in camera&quot; inspection of sensitive documents might determine that some could be released. Escalated to the Supreme Court, the decision issued reversed the appeals decision and confirmed that court inspection could not override the executive&#x27;s exemption. The Court did allow that Congress could change the law with regard to the regulation of executive actions. In 1974, Congress authorized private scrutiny of documents withheld by the executive. President Gerald Ford vetoed the legislation, but his veto was overridden by Congress.

Frustrated by the roll-backs by the Nixon administration of civil liberties and the continuance of the Vietnam War, Mink entered the presidential race in 1971 hoping to become the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee. She was the first Asian-American woman to run for president. As Hawaii had no primary, her name appeared on the Oregon ballot for 1972, as an anti-war candidate. During her campaign, she flew to Paris with Bella Abzug, U.S. Representative of New York, to press for the resumption of peace talks. Arriving in April, the women met with Nguyễn Thị Bình, foreign minister for North Vietnam, as well as representatives for the South Vietnamese and United States governments. Her actions drew strong criticism, fostering a campaign by Democrats in her home state to oppose her next term in Congress. In May, she lost the presidential primary, failing to secure enough delegates to support her candidacy, earning only 2% of the 50 potential delegates. 

Mink co-authored and advocated for the passage of Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act, prohibiting gender discrimination by federally funded institutions of higher education. President Nixon signed the Act into law in 1972. She also introduced the Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act of 1974, which allocated funds for the promotion of gender equity in schools. The law opened employment and education opportunities for women and opposed gender stereotypes in curricula and textbooks. In addition to her work on education issues, Mink promoted numerous laws that dealt with other issues important to women. These included the Consumer Product Safety and Equal Employment Opportunity Acts of 1972; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974; and various bills dealing with discrimination in insurance practices, pensions, retirement benefits, social security, survivor&#x27;s benefits and taxation; equitable jury service; health care issues; housing discrimination based on marital status; and privacy issues. In 1973, she authored and introduced the Equal Rights for Women Act (H.R. 4034), which never made it out of committee, and she supported the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.

In 1975, Mink attended the World Conference on Women held in Mexico City from mid-June to early July. Together with Abzug and Representative Margaret Heckler of Massachusetts, she pledged to sponsor and support legislation for a U.S. women&#x27;s conference for the United States Bicentennial. When they returned home, Abzug introduced HR 9924, co-sponsored by Mink and others, which granted $5 million in total taxpayer contributions ($ in dollars) for both state and National Women&#x27;s Conferences. It was signed into law by President Ford. Later that year, an effort was made to exempt school athletics from the provisions of Title IX via the Casey Amendment. The Amendment proposed allowing schools to determine whether they would provide equal funding for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sporting activities. The exemption was struck from the Senate version of the appropriations bill. In the House, though Mink had lobbied heavily against the amendment to the appropriations bill (H.R. 5901), immediately before the vote was called she left the chamber, having received an emergency message that her daughter had been in a serious car accident in New York. In a 211 against and 212 for vote, the appropriation bill passed with the Casey Amendment intact. Upon her return from New York, Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma and other members of the House called for a revote due to the circumstances. July 17 members revoted and with 215 in favor to 178 against, the Casey Amendment was rejected; so protecting the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX.

Throughout her tenure, Mink was involved in many congressional activities, including serving as vice-chair of the Democratic Study Group from 1966 through 1971. In 1968, she served as chair of the House-Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Poverty. From 1972 to 1976, she served on the House Budget Committee, chaired the Insular Affairs Subcommittee on mines and mining from 1973 to 1977 and from 1975 to 1976 was part of the Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf. In 1976, learning that she had been given the experimental drug diethylstilbestrol, during her pregnancy, which unwittingly placed both her and her daughter at risk of developing cancer, Mink brought a class action lawsuit against Eli Lilly and Company and the University of Chicago. The settlement entitled all 1,000 women affected, and their children, to free lifetime diagnostic testing and treatment at the Chicago Lying-In Clinic. That year, she also filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission which successfully required radio stations to provide equal air time to opposing views. Mink introduced the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which was enacted in 1977. From 1975 to 1977, during the 94th Congress, she was elected to a position in the House Democratic leadership, as Secretary of the House Democratic Caucus.

===U.S. Assistant Secretary of State (1977–1978)===
In 1976, Mink gave up her seat in Congress to run for a vacancy in the United States Senate created by the retirement of Senator Hiram Fong. After she lost the primary election for the Senate seat to Hawaii&#x27;s other U.S. Representative, Spark Matsunaga, President Jimmy Carter appointed Mink as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. She worked on environmental issues such as deep sea mining, toxic waste, and whale protection, holding the post from March 1977 to May 1978.

==Return to the private sector (1980–1987)==
Mink resigned from the Carter Administration in 1980, accepting a position as president of the Americans for Democratic Action in Washington, D. C. She was the first woman to head the national organization and served three consecutive one-year terms. Returning to Honolulu, she was elected to the Honolulu City Council in 1983, serving as chair until 1985. She was regularly on opposite sides to the Republican Mayor of Honolulu Frank Fasi, who was elected in 1984, though she remained on the council until 1987. In 1986 she ran for governor of Hawaii and in 1988 for mayor of Honolulu, but was not successful in either bid for office. When she left the city council, Mink began working for The Public Reporter, a watchdog committee that monitored and published reports on voting records and pending legislation. She also led the Hawaii Coalition on Global Affairs, a group which sponsored public lectures and workshops on international issues.

==Return to Congress (1990–2002)==
In 1990, Mink was elected to complete the remaining term of her successor in the House, Daniel Akaka. Akaka had been appointed to the Senate to succeed Matsunaga, who had recently died in office. She was elected to a full term six weeks later, and subsequently was reelected six times. That year, she opposed the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. When the Senate Judiciary Committee denied Anita Hill the opportunity to give testimony, Mink, and other congresswomen, including Barbara Boxer of California, Louise Slaughter of New York, and Pat Schroeder of Colorado, marched to the Capitol to protest the decision. Their protest was carried on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Hill was later allowed to testify.

In her second tenure as a House member, Mink worked to revive protections in the socio-economic programs she had worked for in her first six terms, which had been scaled back by subsequent administrations. From 1990 to 1993, she worked on legislation sponsoring the Ovarian Cancer Research Act and amendments to the Higher Education Act. In 1992, she was honored by the American Bar Association with the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers Achievement Award for professional excellence. She co-sponsored the Gender Equity Act of 1993, pressed for universal health care, and introduced a bill to protect reproductive decisions as an individual right. She worked on legislation regarding displaced homemakers, minimum wage increases, occupational safety, pay inequality, and violence against women.

In May 1994, Mink and Representative Norman Mineta of California co-founded the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus for which she became chair in 1995, serving until 1997. She also served as co-chair of the House Democratic Women&#x27;s Caucus. In 1996, Mink opposed the welfare-reform legislation proposed by the Republican-majority House and supported by the Clinton administration. She authored the Family Stability and Work Act as an alternative welfare reform measure and repeatedly, though mostly unsuccessfully, lobbied for increased federal safety nets for children and families living in impoverished conditions. She opposed legislation that would limit liability for product injuries and work place discrimination and objected to the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement. She was a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act and staunchly opposed the creation of the United States Department of Homeland Security, fearing that it might avert civil liberties and result in another occurrence of policies like the internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II.

Mink and other members of the House of Representatives objected to counting the 25 electoral votes from Florida which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election. Without Florida&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Death==

On August 30, 2002, Mink was hospitalized in Honolulu&#x27;s Straub Clinic and Hospital due to complications from chickenpox. Her condition steadily worsened, and on September 28, 2002, she died in Honolulu of viral pneumonia, at age 74. In recognition of the national mourning of her death, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered all flags at military institutions lowered to half staff in her honor. Mink received a national memorial and was honored with a state funeral held on October 4 in the Hawaii State Capitol Rotunda attended by leaders and members of Congress. Women&#x27;s groups honored Mink by forming a human lei of approximately 900 women who surrounded the tent where Mink&#x27;s casket stood in the capital atrium, while singing Hawaiian songs. She was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, near the Punchbowl Crater. Mink&#x27;s death occurred one week after she had won the 2002 primary election, too late for her name to be removed from the general election ballot. On November 5, 2002, Mink was posthumously re-elected to Congress. Her vacant seat was filled by Ed Case after a special election on January 4, 2003.

==Legacy==
Mink is remembered as a woman who dealt with the personal discrimination she had experienced as a woman and an Asian American by devoting her career to creating public policies to open doors for women and minorities. In 2002 Congress renamed the Title IX Amendment of the Higher Education Act, which Mink had co-authored, as the &quot;Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act&quot;. Her papers were donated in 2002 and are housed in the Library of Congress. In 2003 a scholarship program, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Education Foundation, was established to provide educational funding for low-income women and children. That year, Mink was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and the Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame of the Institute for International Sport, and the post office serving the area of Maui in which she grew up was renamed the Patsy Takemoto Mink Post Office Building in her honor, after authorization by President George W. Bush. In 2007, Central Oahu Regional Park on Oahu was renamed &quot;Patsy T. Mink Central Oahu Regional Park&quot; in her honor. She was honored posthumously with the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama on November 24, 2014. In June 2022, a portrait of her by Sharon Sprung was unveiled in the U.S. Capitol, where it now hangs.

Documentary films about Mink&#x27;s life and role in Title IX include the &quot;Patsy Mink: Ahead of the Majority&quot; (2008), directed by Kimberlee Bassford and &quot;Rise of the Wahine&quot; (2014), directed by Dean Kaneshiro. The 2008 film highlighted the challenges Mink overcame and how that fueled her work on legislation to help others. The 2014 film told the story of the University of Hawaii&#x27;s women&#x27;s volleyball team&#x27;s struggle to build a team even after Title IX passed. As the bill was an educational funding law, women&#x27;s athletic director, Donnis Thompson used it as leverage to expand sporting opportunities at the university in spite of intense opposition. Working together to ensure that lawmakers understood who they were representing, Mink had Thompson bring the team to Washington.

In 2024, the United States Mint honored Mink with the 2024 Patsy Takemoto Mink Quarter, which was the 12th coin released in the American Women Quarter program.

<doc id="712553" wikidata="Q745262" url="?curid=712553" title="Royal penguin">
<text>The royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli) is a species of penguin, which can be found only on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island and adjacent islands. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the royal penguin as Least Concern. The scientific name commemorates the German zoologist Hermann Schlegel.

== Description ==

There was some controversy over whether royal penguins are a subspecies of macaroni penguins. Individuals of the two groups have been known to interbreed, though this is a relatively rare occurrence. Indeed, other penguins have been known to form mixed-species pairs in the wild.

They inhabit the waters surrounding Antarctica. Royals look very much like macaroni penguins, but have a white face and chin instead of the macaronis&#x27; black visage. They are long and weigh . Males are larger than females. Royal penguins breed only on Macquarie Island and adjacent islands. Like other penguins, they spend much of their time at sea, where they are assumed to be pelagic.

== Breeding ==
Royal penguins nest on beaches or on bare areas on slopes covered with vegetation. Like most seabirds they are colonial, nesting in scrapes on the ground up to a mile inland. The breeding season begins in September with laying following in October. Though royals typically lay two eggs, only one usually survives. The egg is kept warm by both parents for around 35 days. This is done by rotating 12-day shifts. After hatching, the male cares for the chick for 2 to 3 weeks, when the female returns with food for both of them. If the female is delayed or fails to return to the colony, the chick will die. At about one month old, the chicks begin to group together for warmth and safety. Both parents continue to feed chicks two to three times a day. When the chicks are just over two months old, they will have grown their adult plumage and will leave the colony to go to sea to feed on their own.

It is common for the mother of multiple eggs to abandon their first egg only a day before their second egg arrives. Due to this abandonment the first egg has half the chance of hatching as the second egg that was kept. The causes of this behaviour are still unclear.

== Diet ==

Royal penguins feed on krill, small fish, and small amounts of squid.

During breeding season, royal penguins will hunt in localised areas in conjunction to neighbouring colonies. This implies a cohabitation with other colonies by sectoring off fishing areas for certain colonies, nearly eliminating resource competition.

== Threats ==
Royal penguins as a species are classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, with high risk of endangerment in the wild. The Royal Penguin is not listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

Historically they were hunted for their oil; between 1870 and 1919 the government of Tasmania issuing licences for hunting them, with an average of 150,000 penguins (both royal and king) being taken each year. At the peak of the industry in 1905, the plant established on Macquarie Island was processing 2000 penguins at a time, with each penguin yielding about half a litre of oil.

Since the end of penguin hunting on Macquarie the numbers have climbed to 850,000 pairs. Before hunting started, there were three million penguins on the island (both royal and king). 

Modern threats to the royal penguin include introduced predators such as rats (and formerly cats but they were eradicated from Macquarie Island recently), discarded plastic, pollution, and decreased food supply due to commercial fishing.

<doc id="712560" wikidata="Q170161" url="?curid=712560" title="Corporation (feudal Europe)">
<text>In feudal Europe, a corporation (from the Latin , a body) 
was an aggregation of business interests into a single legal body, entity or compact, usually with an explicit license from city, church, or national leaders. These functioned as effective monopolies for a particular good or labor. Most notably, merchants, bankers, notaries, blacksmiths, shoemakers. These corporations experienced their greatest development between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and declined and then disappeared between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Italy, these corporations were mainly called Arts or Crafts Corporations, in Germanic-speaking countries Guilds. 

== Name ==
The term &quot;corporation&quot; was never used outside of Italy (Corporazioni delle arti e dei mestieri). In other countries, they were called métiers (&quot;craft bodies&quot;) in France, guilds in England, Zünfte in Germany, gremios in Castile, gremis in Catalonia and València, grémios in Portugal, συντεχνία in Greece, and with others denominations.

In Italy they had different names from region to region: Arts and Craft Corporations in Tuscany, fraglie in the Venetian hinterland, scole in Venice, paratici in various cities of Lombardy,gremi in Sardinia, society of arts in Bologna, colleges in Perugia. Often the official name was universitates or collegia in Latin. As late as the 18th century in England it was used to refer to such ventures as the East India Company or the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company: commercial organizations that operated under royal patent to have exclusive rights to a particular area of trade.

== History ==

=== Florence ===
The first of the Corporations was the Calimala corporation, or Merchants&#x27; Guild, which was formed in 1150. The name Calimala most likely derives from the Greek &quot;kalòs mallòs&quot;, or &quot;beautiful wool&quot;, with evident reference to the fact that the art of merchants brought together many wool traders. At the time, Via Calimala was full of shops dedicated to this trade and the headquarters of the corporation was located there.

The seven corporations that were formed in Florence and took the name of Major Arts, were established between the second half of the 12th century and the first half of the 13th century, progressively detaching themselves from the &quot;original&quot; corporation of Calimala. In the year 1266, the main headquarters of the Major Arts Corporations was still Calimala and in that year it was decided that these societies should be organized in an even more stable way, each with its own banner, under which to gather the people in arms if necessary. The members of these corporations found themselves managing and administering large interests and managed to create commercial and financial relationships in many parts of the world; their economic primacy led them by the end of the thirteenth century to the leadership of the Florentine Republic.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===

==== The Zunftrevolution ====
In some cities of the Holy Roman Empire, artisans organized into corporations came to seize power in the Zunftrevolution In these free cities of the Empire the &quot;government of the arts&quot; were established for a period, which guaranteed the corporations a dominant position in the city council. In Zurich the corporate constitution (Zunftverfassung) was established in 1336 and lasted until 1798. Other Swiss cities with a corporate regime were Basel, Schaffhausen and St. Gallen. In Cologne and Aachen the corporations acted politically within larger organizations called Gaffeln. In 1396 the 22 Gaffeln signed the &quot;Letter of Alliance&quot;, which introduced a constitutional system to Cologne through which the Gaffeln took over the political management of the city, removing it from the control of patrician families, which in Cologne was called Richerzeche. In 1450 the inhabitants of Aachen did the same and promulgated the so-called Aachener Gaffelbrief. In Flanders, in Ghent, Bruges and Liège, the corporations managed to obtain only a few seats in the city&#x27;s cpirt, alongside those occupied by the old patricians. However, between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Age, the majority of corporate republics (Zunftrepubliken) disappeared under the pressure of territorial princes, and the political power of the corporations was suppressed or reduced to commercial matters. By 1550 the power of the corporations (Zunftherrschaft) was canceled in all the cities of the Empire by Charles V. Subsequently, until the end of the Holy Roman Empire the cities would be governed by the city&#x27;s patriciate.

== Age of Absolutism ==
With the advent of Absolutism, the corporations lost any political role, but maintained and enforced their economic role. They became instruments of the monarchies dirigist policies in exchange for the monopoly of their trade.

Within the corporations, the role of master became almost hereditary, while workers were gradually left outside the trade corporations. In the corporations, the traditional hierarchy between major and minor arts was in some cases transformed into a relationship of trade between individual corporations, more similar as today, thus, for example, dyers and weavers business corporations came to depend on fabric businessmen.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, the Enlightenment promoted the idea of the free market and consequently the enlightened sovereigns abolished the corporation guilds. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1770, the Duchy of Milan in 1787. In France they were suppressed by the Revolution in 1791 with the Le Chapelier law. In London livery companies were not abolished, but were reduced to a ceremonial role only.

== The organization of corporations ==
Regardless of geographical diversity and political involvement, the primary task of each corporation was the defense of the monopoly of the exercise of its trade and those who practiced it even though they were not members were considered by the corporation to be workers who constituted a potential danger. towards members. It is therefore possible to identify traits common to all corporations, regarding their line of conduct and the objectives pursued.

The protection of the quality of manufactured goods, especially with regard to corporations dedicated to commercial activities; the internal regulations imposed strict control on the use of raw materials, work tools, processing techniques in a primitive form of property rights enforcement, i.e. those products that did not comply with the quality standards set by the associations.

The principle of equality between members, which although only formally respected, was aimed at preventing actions of unfair competition between members of the corporation; in reality the carrying out of the activities was bound by a hierarchical order, which distinguished the members into masters, apprentices and simple workers, creating a notable economic disparity among the members.

The training of new freshmen, through a period of apprenticeship (the current internship) had a variable duration from city to city; the apprentice entered as a child into the master&#x27;s workshop who undertook to teach him all the secrets of the trade.

The exercise of jurisdiction over its members, whereby the corporations claimed exclusive jurisdiction in matters within their jurisdiction, such as lawsuits between members and infringements committed against the regulations.

Each corporation had its own statute and was structured according to representative bodies:

The Corporal: it was the plenary assembly of members which initially met at close intervals and elected representatives called, depending on the case, consuls, priors, rectors, captains, etc.; the consuls remained in office only for short periods and had the task of managing all the corporation&#x27;s activities, including external public relations.

The Council: was a smaller consultative body with the task of ratifying or rejecting the decisions of the Corporal and gradually replaced the Corporal, which was convened less and less frequently.

The bureaucratic apparatus: generally composed of a notary with the functions of secretary and protocol officer and a treasurer.

== Economic effects ==
The effects of a corporation were similar to a monopoly. On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., the ability to be an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy). Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated. (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by revoking the patent, but this rarely occurred.)

It was founded in 1977 by brothers Jerry and Mark Silverman as a subsidiary of Retail Ventures, Inc., a company that also owned and operated Silverman&#x27;s Menswear. The Silvermans sold their ownership interests in 1991 to Sophia Price of Knoxville, Tennessee. American Eagle Outfitters is the parent company of Aerie, Unsubscribed and Todd Snyder.

American Eagle retails jeans, polo shirts, graphic T-shirts, boxers, outerwear, and swimwear. American Eagle targets male and female university and high school students, although older adults also wear the brand.

In 1977, the first American Eagle Outfitters store opened in Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan. As of January 2023, the company operated 1,175 American Eagle stores, 175 Aerie stores, and 12 Todd Snyder stores across the US, Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong.

== Development ==


American Eagle&#x27;s beginning was with the Silverman family, which owned and operated Silvermans Menswear. By the mid-1970s, two of the Silverman brothers—the third generation of Silvermans in the family business—were running the business. Jerry Silverman was the president and CEO, while his brother, Mark, served as executive vice-president and COO. The Silverman brothers were convinced they needed to diversify their product offerings in order to continue growing their company. They also recognized that the addition of new family-owned chains would then enable them to operate more than one store in the same mall. Their first attempt was to open American Eagle Outfitters in 1977, positioning it as a proprietor of brand-name leisure apparel, footwear, as well as accessories for men and women, emphasizing merchandise suited for outdoor sports, such as hiking, mountain climbing, and camping. Stores were set up in shopping malls and a catalog was established. The chain grew for much of the 1980s. In 1989, the owners decided to refocus their business on American Eagle Outfitters, selling their other retail chains. At the time, there were 137 American Eagle Outfitters stores in 36 different states.

Despite the plans for quick growth after the reorganization, American Eagle Outfitters opened only 16 new stores by 1991 and the company was losing money. At this point, the Schottensteins, who had been 50% owners of the chain since 1980, bought out the Silverman family&#x27;s interest. This change in leadership resulted in American Eagle finding its present niche: casual clothing for men and women selling private label clothes.

When the company began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange in the second quarter of 1994, it had 167 stores and a healthy cash flow. With the cash infusion from the IPO, the company opened more than 90 new stores over the next year. Several new executives joined the company in 1995 and &#x27;96, leading to another change in the target demographic. Over the next five years, revenues quintupled to $1 billion by 2000. AEO opened the first Canadian store in 2000.

As of January 30, 2016, the company operated 949 AEO brand stores, and 97 stand-alone and 67 side-by-side Aerie stores in shopping malls, lifestyle centers, and street locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, and internationally. The company had 21 franchised stores operated by franchise partners in 10 countries. On January 22, 2014, then-CEO Robert Hanson stepped down and Jay Schottenstein became interim CEO.

===Finances and operations===
On March 15, 2005, the company adjusted its accounting of rent expenses and construction allowances after the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that a number of companies had been improperly logging these items. Due to &quot;disappointing product execution in the women&#x27;s category&quot;, American Eagle posted only a 3% gain in its 2013 second-quarter profits and the stock price dropped.

=== Products ===
On 27 July 2020, American Eagle Outfitters revealed it would sell a new range of fitness wear called &quot;Offline&quot; by Aerie, targeted at consumers who want apparel that can be used for both their workouts and relaxation.

==Corporate and headquarters==

In mid-2007, American Eagle moved its headquarters from Warrendale, Pennsylvania, to a more urban location at the SouthSide Works complex in Pittsburgh. The cost of the buildings and adjacent property was approximately $21 million (excluding interior finishing and additional construction costs). The addresses of the buildings are 19 Hot Metal Street and 77 Hot Metal Street, with the numbers symbolizing the first store opening in 1977. The Southside Works Campus includes a private garage, a lab store for each brand, a photo studio, and an in-house cafeteria. Other offices are in New York (design and production).

===Franchise agreement===
In June 2009, the company signed the franchisee agreement with M. H. Alshaya, one of the leading retailers in the Middle East. The agreement saw the introduction of the first stores outside North America, with the first two opening in Dubai and Kuwait on March 16 and 25, 2010, respectively, and another that opened on October 15, 2011, in Kaslik, Lebanon. Another opened in June 2012 in Hamra Street, Beirut, followed by one in Beirut City Centre, Hazmieh.

===Logistics===
The company maintains distribution centers in Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Ottawa, Kansas; and Mississauga, Ontario.

==Stores==

Items are placed on wooden shelving, tables, or clothes racks. The clothes in AEO Factory stores are hung on basic black hangers, and AEO stores have wooden hangers. There is usually a flat-screen television hanging in the back of the store or behind the cash wrap. The floors are typically wood or concrete. The theme and displays change based on seasonal lines and promotions.

==Subsidiaries==
===aerie===
In February 2006, American Eagle launched the aerie lingerie sub-brand, targeting American 15- to 22-year-old females. In addition to lingerie such as bras and other undergarments, the aerie line sells dorm wear, active apparel, loungewear, accessories and sleepwear. What started as a sub-brand quickly became a standalone concept in its own right, featuring a complete fitness line, called aerie f.i.t. The aerie brand is sold in American Eagle Outfitters stores, on the American Eagle website, and in stand-alone aerie retail stores. The first stand-alone aerie store opened in August 2006 in Greenville, South Carolina, and was followed by two more test stores later that year. As of December 2010, there were 147 stand-alone aerie stores in the U.S. and Canada. Aerie has started a campaign that focuses on promoting models&#x27; real bodies. This entails their slogan #AerieREAL and adding to their advertisements that models have not been retouched. In this way they take a stand against the use of photo manipulation in media. Iskra Lawrence, while she models for the lingerie line, is also the global role model for the brand.

===Martin + Osa===
The company&#x27;s second stand-alone lifestyle concept launched in 2006 and targeted men and women age 28 to 40. It featured cashmere sweaters and casual clothing for an older target audience. It also sold products by Fred Perry, Ray-Ban, Adidas, Onitsuka Tiger, and HOBO International. In March 2010, management announced that all 28 Martin + Osa stores would be closed, after a failure in retail markets, causing AEO, Inc. to lose up to $44 million.

===77kids===
In October 2008, American Eagle released and launched &quot;77kids,&quot; a line of clothing aimed at children aged two to ten. Initially an online only concept, AEO opened its first 77kids store on July 15, 2010, in The Mall at Robinson in Pittsburgh, and eight others followed that year. Expansion continued throughout FY2011. 77kids stores, targeted at younger children, featured interactive games and activities throughout the stores that children could play with while shopping.

American Eagle Outfitters announced on May 15, 2012, that it would sell or close all 22 77kids stores by the end of July 2012. Robert Hanson, who became CEO in January 2012, said 77kids had a loss after taxes of roughly $24 million on sales of $40 million in the 2011 fiscal year. On August 3, 2012, American Eagle Outfitters completed the sale of its 77kids to Ezrani 2 Corp, a company formed by Ezra Dabah, the former chairman and CEO of The Children&#x27;s Place. Ezrani renamed the store &quot;Ruum&quot; in 2013.

=== Tailgate and Todd Snyder ===
In November 2015, American Eagle Outfitters acquired Todd Snyder&#x27;s eponymous label, as well as his Tailgate Clothing Company, a brand centered on vintage-style collegiate apparel. American Eagle initially focused on Southeastern Conference and Big Ten colleges, hoping to gain more popularity among its target demographic of teenagers and college students.

===Bluenotes&#x27;===
After its acquisition of Thiftys from Dylex, the 107 stores were rebranded as Bluenotes&#x27; in 2000, then sold off in 2004.

=== Unsubscribed ===

American Eagle Outfitters created a new upmarket brand focused on sustainable quality goods in 2020. Boutiques can be found in prestigious resort neighborhoods.

=== Quiet Logistics ===
American Eagle Outfitters announced a $350 million acquisition of Quiet Logistics on November 2, 2021. The acquisition was completed on December 29, 2021.

==International expansion==
American Eagle opened its first Canadian store in 2001 after it purchased assets of Dylex. In 2010, AEO opened stores in Kuwait, Riyadh, and Dubai. A store in Kaslik, Lebanon, opened on October 15, 2011. A store in Cairo, Egypt, opened in late 2011. In September 2011, two stores opened in Moscow, Russia. Its first store in Jordan opened in November 2011 in the brand-new Taj Mall. Its first store in Tokyo, Japan opened on April 18, 2012. The first store in Tel Aviv, Israel, opened in February 2012, after the Israeli-based clothing retailer FOX signed a contract with AEO, and expanded to Jerusalem. There are also stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. American Eagle Outfitters opened its first store in the Philippines in March 2013.

American Eagle is also opening stores in Mexico. The first opened in Mexico City at Fashion Mall Perisur on February 20, 2013, and at Centro Santa Fe in June. Another opened in Guadalajara later in 2013 at Fashion Mall Galerías Guadalajara. In 2014 the company financed the rescue and renovation of the Jardín Edith Sánchez Ramírez pocket park in Mexico City.

American Eagle expanded to the U.K. in November 2014, opening stores in Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City, and Bluewater. The Westfield London store opened on November 14, 2014, the Westfield Stratford City store on November 17, 2014, and the Bluewater store on November 19, 2014. All UK operations have ceased, with the UK website closed and all UK stores closed by the end of July 2017.

American Eagle Outfitters opened its first store in Muscat, Oman, on October 3, 2015. The company made its debut in the Indian market in June 2018 with first store launched in DLF Mall of India, Noida. Today it operates 17 stores across the country.

AEO entered the Chilean market in September 2015, with the opening of its first store in the Parque Arauco shopping center. After its arrival in the Chilean market, the company&#x27;s expansion was concentrated in Santiago.

In 2019, American Eagle Outfitters became one of only two major clothing companies with commitments in line with the Paris Agreement&#x27;s goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In 2020, American Eagle Outfitters opened its first store in Prague, Czech Republic, in the factory outlet center Fashion Arena Prague Outlet. In 2023, AEO opened its first store in Uruguay, Punta Carretas Shopping.

==Controversies==

===Strike===
In 2004, the textile and apparel workers union UNITE HERE launched the &quot;American Vulture&quot; back-to-school boycott of American Eagle in protest of alleged workers&#x27; rights violations at the company&#x27;s Canadian distribution contractor National Logistics Services (NLS). On the 2007 second-quarter conference call, CEO James O&#x27;Donnell clarified the American Eagle&#x27;s relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained, 

===Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lawsuits===
Since 1999, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has sued American Eagle Outfitters at least three times for allegedly copying its designs and its advertisements. On all occasions, American Eagle prevailed in court on the grounds that A&amp;F cannot stop it from presenting similar designs since such designs cannot be copyrighted in the United States. Nevertheless, American Eagle clothing designs have since trended away in appearance from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch designs. Judges have generally ruled that giving Abercrombie exclusive rights to market its clothing in a certain way &quot;would be anti-competitive.&quot;

==International stores==
Locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Hong Kong are operated directly by American Eagle, whereas other locations are operated under license agreements with third parties.

<text>Royal Roy: A Prince of a Boy is a 1985-1986 bimonthly comic book from Marvel Comics&#x27; younger-readers&#x27; imprint Star Comics. It was created by Lennie Herman and Warren Kremer.

==Publication history==
&quot;Royal Roy&quot; began in April 1985 as an answer to the successful Harvey Comics &quot;Richie Rich&quot; series. Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional kingdom whose name was a portmanteau of &quot;cash&quot; and &quot;Camelot&quot;. Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury but wasn&#x27;t spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend (Crystal Cleer) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance (Lorna Loot) who vied for his affections.

In late 1985, Harvey Comics sued Marvel for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich. Longtime Harvey creator Lennie Herman had created &quot;Royal Roy&quot; for Star Comics; Herman died in 1983 before the first issue of &quot;Royal Roy&quot; was published. Artist Warren Kremer, the co-creator, was also the co-creator of Richie Rich.

&quot;Royal Roy&quot; was cancelled after six issues in March 1986 and Harvey&#x27;s lawsuit was dropped.

===&quot;X-Babies&quot;===
An updated version of Royal Roy (along with Planet Terry, Top Dog, and Wally the Wizard) is featured in the four-issue &quot;X-Babies&quot; miniseries published by Marvel Comics in late 2009.

<doc id="712576" wikidata="Q259516" url="?curid=712576" title="Passive smoking">
<text>Passive smoking is the inhalation of tobacco smoke, called passive smoke, secondhand smoke (SHS) or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), by individuals other than the active smoker. It occurs when tobacco smoke diffuses into the surrounding atmosphere as an aerosol pollutant, which leads to its inhalation by nearby bystanders within the same environment. Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke causes many of the same health effects caused by active smoking, although at a lower prevalence due to the reduced concentration of smoke that enters the airway.

According to a WHO report published in 2023, more than 1.3 million deaths are attributed to passive smoking worldwide every year. The health risks of secondhand smoke are a matter of scientific consensus, and have been a major motivation for smoking bans in workplaces and indoor venues, including restaurants, bars and night clubs, as well as some open public spaces.

Concerns around secondhand smoke have played a central role in the debate over the harms and regulation of tobacco products. Since the early 1970s, the tobacco industry has viewed public concern over secondhand smoke as a serious threat to its business interests. Despite the industry&#x27;s awareness of the harms of secondhand smoke as early as the 1980s, the tobacco industry coordinated a scientific controversy with the purpose of stopping regulation of their products.

==Terminology==
Fritz Lickint created the term &quot;passive smoking&quot; (&quot;Passivrauchen&quot;) in a publication in the German language during the 1930s. Terms used include &quot;environmental tobacco smoke&quot; to refer to the airborne matter, while &quot;involuntary smoking&quot; and &quot;passive smoking&quot; refer to exposure to secondhand smoke. The term &quot;environmental tobacco smoke&quot; can be traced back to a 1974 industry-sponsored meeting held in Bermuda, while the term &quot;passive smoking&quot; was first used in the title of a scientific paper in 1970. The Surgeon General of the United States prefers to use the phrase &quot;secondhand smoke&quot; rather than &quot;environmental tobacco smoke&quot;, stating that &quot;The descriptor &#x27;secondhand&#x27; captures the involuntary nature of the exposure, while &#x27;environmental&#x27; does not.&quot; Most researchers consider the term &quot;passive smoking&quot; to be synonymous with &quot;secondhand smoke&quot;. In contrast, a 2011 commentary in &quot;Environmental Health Perspectives&quot; argued that research into &quot;thirdhand smoke&quot; renders it inappropriate to refer to passive smoking with the term &quot;secondhand smoke&quot;, which the authors stated constitutes a pars pro toto.

The term &quot;sidestream smoke&quot; is sometimes used to refer to smoke that goes into the air directly from a burning cigarette, cigar, or pipe, while &quot;mainstream smoke&quot; refers to smoke that a smoker exhales.

== Health effects ==
Secondhand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking, including cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases. These include:
* Cancer:
** General: overall increased risk; reviewing the evidence accumulated on a worldwide basis, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2004 that &quot;Involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or &#x27;environmental&#x27; tobacco smoke) is carcinogenic to humans.&quot; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 70 chemicals present in secondhand smoke are carcinogenic.
** Lung cancer: Passive smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, secondhand smoke is estimated to cause more than 7,000 deaths from lung cancer a year among non-smokers. A quarter of all cases occur in people who have never smoked.
** Breast cancer: The California Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2005 that passive smoking increases the risk of breast cancer in younger, primarily premenopausal females by 70% and the US Surgeon General has concluded that the evidence is &quot;suggestive&quot;, but still insufficient to assert such a causal relationship. In contrast, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2004 that there was &quot;no support for a causal relation between involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke and breast cancer in never-smokers.&quot; A 2015 meta-analysis found that the evidence that passive smoking moderately increased the risk of breast cancer had become &quot;more substantial than a few years ago&quot;.
** Cervical cancer: A 2015 overview of systematic reviews found that exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk of cervical cancer.
** Bladder cancer: A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that secondhand smoke exposure was associated with a significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer.
* Circulatory system: risk of heart disease and reduced heart rate variability.
** Epidemiological studies have shown that both active and passive cigarette smoking increase the risk of atherosclerosis.
** Passive smoking is strongly associated with an increased risk of stroke, and this increased risk is disproportionately high at low levels of exposure.
* Lung problems:
** Risk of asthma
** Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
** According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak.
** The majority of studies on the association between secondhand smoke exposure and sinusitis have found a significant association between the two.
* Cognitive impairment and dementia: Exposure to secondhand smoke may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in adults 50 and over. Children exposed to secondhand smoke show reduced vocabulary and reasoning skills when compared with non-exposed children as well as more general cognitive and intellectual deficits.
* Mental health: Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms.
* During pregnancy:
** Miscarriage: a 2014 meta-analysis found that maternal secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of miscarriage by 11%.
** Low birth weight, part B, ch. 3.
** Premature birth, part B, ch. 3 (Evidence of the causal link is described only as &quot;suggestive&quot; by the US Surgeon General in his 2006 report.) Laws limiting smoking decrease premature births.
** Stillbirth and congenital malformations in children
** Recent studies comparing females exposed to secondhand smoke and non-exposed females, demonstrate that females exposed while pregnant have higher risks of delivering a child with congenital abnormalities, longer lengths, smaller head circumferences, and neural tube defects.
* General:
** Worsening of asthma, allergies, and other conditions. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a slightly increased risk of allergic diseases among children and adolescents; the evidence for an association was weaker for adults.
** Type 2 diabetes. It remains unclear whether the association between passive smoking and diabetes is causal.
* Risk of carrying &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;.
* A possible increased risk of periodontitis.
* Overall increased risk of death in both adults, where it was estimated to kill 53,000 nonsmokers per year in the U.S in 1991, and in children. The World Health Organization states that passive smoking causes about 600,000 deaths a year, and about 1% of the global burden of disease. As of 2017, passive smoking causes about 900,000 deaths a year, which is about 1/8 of all deaths caused by smoking.
* Skin conditions: A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a higher rate of atopic dermatitis.

===Risk to children===
* Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In his 2006 report, the US Surgeon General concludes: &quot;The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and sudden infant death syndrome.&quot; Secondhand smoking has been estimated to be associated with 430 SIDS deaths in the United States annually.
* Asthma. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma.
* Lung infections, also including more severe illness with bronchiolitis and bronchitis, and worse outcome, as well as increased risk of developing tuberculosis if exposed to a carrier. In the United States, it is estimated that secondhand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year.
* Impaired respiratory function and slowed lung growth
* Allergies
* Maternal passive smoking increases the risk of non-syndromic orofacial clefts by 50% among their children.
* Learning difficulties, developmental delays, executive function problems, and neurobehavioral effects. Animal models suggest a role for nicotine and carbon monoxide in neurocognitive problems.
* Increased risk of middle ear infections.
* Invasive meningococcal disease.
* Anesthesia complications and some negative surgical outcomes.
* Sleep disordered breathing: Most studies have found a significant association between passive smoking and sleep disordered breathing in children, but further studies are needed to determine whether this association is causal.
* Adverse effects on the cardiovascular system of children.

== Evidence ==

Epidemiological studies show that non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk for many of the health problems associated with direct smoking.

In 1992, a review estimated that secondhand smoke exposure was responsible for 35,000 to 40,000 deaths per year in the United States in the early 1980s. The absolute risk increase of heart disease due to ETS was 2.2%, while the attributable risk percent was 23%. A 1997 meta-analysis found that secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of heart disease by a quarter, and two 1999 meta-analyses reached similar conclusions.

Evidence shows that inhaled sidestream smoke, the main component of secondhand smoke, is about four times more toxic than mainstream smoke. This fact has been known to the tobacco industry since the 1980s, though it kept its findings secret. Some scientists believe that the risk of passive smoking, in particular the risk of developing coronary heart diseases, may have been substantially underestimated.

In 1997, a meta-analysis on the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and lung cancer concluded that such exposure caused lung cancer. The increase in risk was estimated to be 24% among non-smokers who lived with a smoker. In 2000, Copas and Shi reported that there was clear evidence of publication bias in the studies included in this meta-analysis. They further concluded that after correcting for publication bias, and assuming that 40% of all studies are unpublished, this increased risk decreased from 24% to 15%. This conclusion has been challenged on the basis that the assumption that 40% of all studies are unpublished was &quot;extreme&quot;. In 2006, Takagi et al. reanalyzed the data from this meta-analysis to account for publication bias and estimated that the relative risk of lung cancer among those exposed to secondhand smoke was 1.19, slightly lower than the original estimate. A 2000 meta-analysis found a relative risk of 1.48 for lung cancer among men exposed to secondhand smoke, and a relative risk of 1.16 among those exposed to it at work. Another meta-analysis confirmed the finding of an increased risk of lung cancer among women with spousal exposure to secondhand smoke the following year. It found a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.29 for women exposed to secondhand smoke from their spouses. A 2014 meta-analysis noted that &quot;the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk is well established.&quot;

A minority of epidemiologists have found it hard to understand how secondhand smoke, which is more diluted than actively inhaled smoke, could have an effect that is such a large fraction of the added risk of coronary heart disease among active smokers. One proposed explanation is that secondhand smoke is not simply a diluted version of &quot;mainstream&quot; smoke, but has a different composition with more toxic substances per gram of total particulate matter. Passive smoking appears to be capable of precipitating the acute manifestations of cardio-vascular diseases (atherothrombosis) and may also have a negative impact on the outcome of patients who have acute coronary syndromes.

In 2004, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed all significant published evidence related to tobacco smoking and cancer. It concluded:

Subsequent meta-analyses have confirmed these findings.

The National Asthma Council of Australia cites studies showing that secondhand smoke is probably the most important indoor pollutant, especially around young children:
* Smoking by either parent, particularly by the mother, increases the risk of asthma in children.
* The outlook for early childhood asthma is less favourable in smoking households.
* Children with asthma who are exposed to smoking in the home generally have more severe disease.
* Many adults with asthma identify ETS as a trigger for their symptoms.
* Doctor-diagnosed asthma is more common among non-smoking adults exposed to ETS than those not exposed. Among people with asthma, higher ETS exposure is associated with a greater risk of severe attacks.

In France, exposure to secondhand smoke has been estimated to cause between 3,000 and 5,000 premature deaths per year, with the larger figure cited by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin during his announcement of a nationwide smoke-free law: &quot;That makes more than 13 deaths a day. It is an unacceptable reality in our country in terms of public health.&quot;

There is good observational evidence that smoke-free legislation reduces the number of hospital admissions for heart disease.

=== Exposure and risk levels ===
The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that there was sufficient evidence that secondhand smoke caused cancer in humans. Those who work in environments where smoke is not regulated are at higher risk. Workers particularly at risk of exposure include those in installation repair and maintenance, construction and extraction, and transportation.

Much research has come from studies of nonsmokers who are married to a smoker. The US Surgeon General, in his 2006 report, estimated that living or working in a place where smoking is permitted increases the non-smokers&#x27; risk of developing heart disease by 25–30% and lung cancer by 20–30%.

Similarly, children who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke are shown to experience a range of adverse effects and a higher risk of becoming smokers later in life. The WHO has identified reduction of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as key element for actions to encourage healthy child development.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the extent of and trends in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke by measuring serum cotinine in national health surveys. The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure among U.S. nonsmokers declined from 87.5% in 1988 to 25.2% in 2014. However, nearly half of blacks and the poor were exposed in 2014.

=== Interventions to reduce environmental tobacco smoke ===
A systematic review compared smoking control programmes and their effects on smoke exposure in children. The review distinguishes between community-based, ill-child and healthy-child settings and the most common types of interventions were counselling or brief advice during clinical visits. The review did not find superior outcomes for any intervention, and the authors caution that evidence from adult settings may not generalise well to children.

===Biomarkers===

Environmental tobacco smoke can be evaluated either by directly measuring tobacco smoke pollutants found in the air or by using biomarkers, an indirect measure of exposure. Carbon monoxide monitored through breath, nicotine, cotinine, thiocyanates, and proteins are the most specific biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Biochemical tests are a much more reliable biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure than surveys. Certain groups of people are reluctant to disclose their smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke, especially pregnant women and parents of young children. This is due to their smoking being socially unacceptable. Also, it may be difficult for individuals to recall their exposure to tobacco smoke.

A 2007 study in the &quot;Addictive Behaviors&quot; journal found a positive correlation between secondhand tobacco smoke exposure and concentrations of nicotine and/or biomarkers of nicotine in the body. Significant biological levels of nicotine from secondhand smoke exposure were equivalent to nicotine levels from active smoking and levels that are associated with behaviour changes due to nicotine consumption.

====Cotinine====
Cotinine, the metabolite of nicotine, is a biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure. Typically, cotinine is measured in the blood, saliva, and urine. Hair analysis has recently become a new, noninvasive measurement technique. Cotinine accumulates in hair during hair growth, which results in a measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke. Urinary cotinine levels have been a reliable biomarker of tobacco exposure and have been used as a reference in many epidemiological studies. However, cotinine levels found in the urine reflect exposure only over the preceding 48 hours. Cotinine levels of the skin, such as the hair and nails, reflect tobacco exposure over the previous three months and are a more reliable biomarker.

====Carbon monoxide (CO)====
Carbon monoxide monitored via breath is also a reliable biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure as well as tobacco use. With high sensitivity and specificity, it not only provides an accurate measure, but the test is also non-invasive, highly reproducible, and low in cost. Breath CO monitoring measures the concentration of CO in an exhalation in parts per million, and this can be directly correlated to the blood CO concentration (carboxyhemoglobin). Breath CO monitors can also be used by emergency services to identify patients who are suspected of having CO poisoning.

== Pathophysiology ==
A 2004 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens. Of special concern are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, and aromatic amines, such as 4-aminobiphenyl, all known to be highly carcinogenic. Mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke, and secondhand smoke contain largely the same components, however the concentration varies depending on type of smoke. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies&#x27; own research to be present at higher concentrations in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke.

Secondhand smoke has been shown to produce more particulate-matter (PM) pollution than an idling low-emission diesel engine. In an experiment conducted by the Italian National Cancer Institute, three cigarettes were left smoldering, one after the other, in a 60 m3 garage with a limited air exchange. The cigarettes produced PM pollution exceeding outdoor limits, as well as PM concentrations up to 10-fold that of the idling engine.

Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure has immediate and substantial effects on blood and blood vessels in a way that increases the risk of a heart attack, particularly in people already at risk. Exposure to tobacco smoke for 30 minutes significantly reduces coronary flow velocity reserve in healthy nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke is also associated with impaired vasodilation among adult nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke exposure also affects platelet function, vascular endothelium, and myocardial exercise tolerance at levels commonly found in the workplace.

Pulmonary emphysema can be induced in rats through acute exposure to sidestream tobacco smoke (30 cigarettes per day) over a period of 45 days. Degranulation of mast cells contributing to lung damage has also been observed.

The term &quot;third-hand smoke&quot; was recently coined to identify the residual tobacco smoke contamination that remains after the cigarette is extinguished and secondhand smoke has cleared from the air. Preliminary research suggests that by-products of third-hand smoke may pose a health risk,
though the magnitude of risk, if any, remains unknown. In October 2011, it was reported that Christus St. Frances Cabrini Hospital in Alexandria, Louisiana, would seek to eliminate third-hand smoke beginning in July 2012, and that employees whose clothing smelled of smoke would not be allowed to work. This prohibition was enacted because third-hand smoke poses a special danger for the developing brains of infants and small children.

In 2008, there were more than 161,000 deaths attributed to lung cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, an estimated 10% to 15% were caused by factors other than first-hand smoking; equivalent to 16,000 to 24,000 deaths annually. Slightly more than half of the lung cancer deaths caused by factors other than first-hand smoking were found in nonsmokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers may well be considered one of the most common cancer mortalities in the United States. Clinical epidemiology of lung cancer has linked the primary factors closely tied to lung cancer in non-smokers as exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, carcinogens including radon, and other indoor air pollutants.

== Opinion of public health authorities ==
There is widespread scientific consensus that exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful. The link between passive smoking and health risks is accepted by every major medical and scientific organisation, including:
* World Health Organization
* U.S. National Institutes of Health
* Centers for Disease Control
* United States Surgeon General
* U.S. National Cancer Institute
* United States Environmental Protection Agency
* California Environmental Protection Agency
* American Heart Association, American Lung Association, and American Cancer Society
* American Medical Association
* American Academy of Pediatrics
* Australian National Health and Medical Research Council
* United Kingdom Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health

== Public opinion ==
Recent major surveys conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control have found widespread public awareness that secondhand smoke is harmful. In both 1992 and 2000 surveys, more than 80% of respondents agreed with the statement that secondhand smoke was harmful. A 2001 study found that 95% of adults agreed that secondhand smoke was harmful to children, and 96% considered tobacco-industry claims that secondhand smoke was not harmful to be untruthful.

A 2007 Gallup poll found that 56% of respondents felt that secondhand smoke was &quot;very harmful&quot;, a number that has held relatively steady since 1997. Another 29% believe that secondhand smoke is &quot;somewhat harmful&quot;; 10% answered &quot;not too harmful&quot;, while 5% said &quot;not at all harmful&quot;.

== Controversy over harm ==
As part of its attempt to prevent or delay tighter regulation of smoking, the tobacco industry funded a number of scientific studies and, where the results cast doubt on the risks associated with secondhand smoke, sought wide publicity for those results. The industry also funded libertarian and conservative think tanks, such as the Cato Institute in the United States and the Institute of Public Affairs in Australia which criticised both scientific research on passive smoking and policy proposals to restrict smoking. &quot;New Scientist&quot; and the &quot;European Journal of Public Health&quot; have identified these industry-wide coordinated activities as one of the earliest expressions of corporate denialism. Further, they state that the disinformation spread by the tobacco industry has created a &quot;tobacco denialism&quot; movement, sharing many characteristics of other forms of denialism, such as HIV-AIDS denialism.

===Industry-funded studies and critiques===

====Enstrom and Kabat====
A 2003 study by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, argued that the harms of passive smoking had been overstated. Their analysis reported no statistically significant relationship between passive smoking and lung cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, though the accompanying editorial noted that &quot;they may overemphasise the negative nature of their findings.&quot; This paper was widely promoted by the tobacco industry as evidence that the harms of passive smoking were unproven. The American Cancer Society (ACS), whose database Enstrom and Kabat used to compile their data, criticized the paper as &quot;neither reliable nor independent&quot;, stating that scientists at the ACS had repeatedly pointed out serious flaws in Enstrom and Kabat&#x27;s methodology prior to publication. Notably, the study had failed to identify a comparison group of &quot;unexposed&quot; persons.

Enstrom&#x27;s ties to the tobacco industry also drew scrutiny; in a 1997 letter to Philip Morris, Enstrom requested a &quot;substantial research commitment... in order for me to effectively compete against the large mountain of epidemiologic data and opinions that already exist regarding the health effects of ETS and active smoking.&quot; In a US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies, the Enstrom and Kabat paper was cited by the US District Court as &quot;a prime example of how nine tobacco companies engaged in criminal racketeering and fraud to hide the dangers of tobacco smoke.&quot; The Court found that the study had been funded and managed by the Center for Indoor Air Research, a tobacco industry front group tasked with &quot;offsetting&quot; damaging studies on passive smoking, as well as by Philip Morris who stated that Enstrom&#x27;s work was &quot;clearly litigation-oriented&quot;. A 2005 paper in &quot;Tobacco Control&quot; argued that the disclosure section in the Enstrom and Kabat BMJ paper, although it met the journal&#x27;s requirements, &quot;does not reveal the full extent of the relationship the authors had with the tobacco industry.&quot;

In 2006, Enstrom and Kabat published a meta-analysis of studies regarding passive smoking and coronary heart disease in which they reported a very weak association between passive smoking and heart disease mortality. They concluded that exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk of death from CHD by only 5%, although this analysis has been criticized for including two previous industry-funded studies that suffered from widespread exposure misclassification.

====Gori====
Gio Batta Gori, a tobacco industry spokesman and consultant and an expert on risk utility and scientific research, wrote in the libertarian Cato Institute&#x27;s magazine &quot;Regulation&quot; that &quot;...of the 75 published studies of ETS and lung cancer, some 70% did not report statistically significant differences of risk and are moot. Roughly 17% claim an increased risk and 13% imply a reduction of risk.&quot;

====Milloy====
Steven Milloy, the &quot;junk science&quot; commentator for Fox News and a former Philip Morris consultant, claimed that &quot;of the 19 studies&quot; on passive smoking &quot;only 8— slightly more than 42%— reported statistically significant increases in heart disease incidence.&quot;

Another component of criticism cited by Milloy focused on relative risk and epidemiological practices in studies of passive smoking. Milloy, who has a master&#x27;s degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, argued that studies yielding relative risks of less than 2 were meaningless junk science. This approach to epidemiological analysis was criticized in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot;:

The tobacco industry and affiliated scientists also put forward a set of &quot;Good Epidemiology Practices&quot; which would have the practical effect of obscuring the link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer; the privately stated goal of these standards was to &quot;impede adverse legislation&quot;. However, this effort was largely abandoned when it became clear that no independent epidemiological organization would agree to the standards proposed by Philip Morris et al.

==== Levois and Layard ====
In 1995, Levois and Layard, both tobacco industry consultants, published two analyses in the journal &quot;Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology&quot; regarding the association between spousal exposure to secondhand smoke and heart disease. Both of these papers reported no association between secondhand smoke and heart disease. These analyses have been criticized for failing to distinguish between current and former smokers, despite the fact that former smokers, unlike current ones, are not at a significantly increased risk of heart disease.

==== World Health Organization controversy ====
A 1998 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) found &quot;weak evidence of a dose–response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS.&quot;

In March 1998, before the study was published, reports appeared in the media alleging that the IARC and the World Health Organization (WHO) were suppressing information. The reports, appearing in the British &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot;, among other sources, alleged that the WHO withheld from publication of its own report that supposedly failed to prove an association between passive smoking and a number of other diseases (lung cancer in particular).

In response, the WHO issued a press release stating that the results of the study had been &quot;completely misrepresented&quot; in the popular press and were in fact very much in line with similar studies demonstrating the harms of passive smoking. The study was published in the &quot;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&quot; in October of the same year, and concluded the authors found &quot;no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk&quot; but &quot;did find weak evidence of a dose–response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS.&quot; An accompanying editorial summarized:

With the release of formerly classified tobacco industry documents through the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, it was found (by Elisa Ong and Stanton Glantz) that the controversy over the WHO&#x27;s alleged suppression of data had been engineered by Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and other tobacco companies in an effort to discredit scientific findings which would harm their business interests. A WHO inquiry, conducted after the release of the tobacco-industry documents, found that this controversy was generated by the tobacco industry as part of its larger campaign to cut the WHO&#x27;s budget, distort the results of scientific studies on passive smoking, and discredit the WHO as an institution. This campaign was carried out using a network of ostensibly independent front organizations and international and scientific experts with hidden financial ties to the industry.

==== EPA lawsuit ====
In 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report estimating that 3,000 lung cancer related deaths in the United States were caused by passive smoking annually.

Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and groups representing growers, distributors and marketers of tobacco took legal action, claiming that the EPA had manipulated this study and ignored accepted scientific and statistical practices.

The United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina ruled in favor of the tobacco industry in 1998, finding that the EPA had failed to follow proper scientific and epidemiologic practices and had &quot;cherry picked&quot; evidence to support conclusions which they had committed to in advance. The court stated in part, &quot;EPA publicly committed to a conclusion before research had begun...adjusted established procedure and scientific norms to validate the Agency&#x27;s public conclusion... In conducting the ETS Risk Assessment, disregarded information and made findings on selective information; did not disseminate significant epidemiologic information; deviated from its Risk Assessment Guidelines; failed to disclose important findings and reasoning...&quot;

In 2002, the EPA successfully appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The EPA&#x27;s appeal was upheld on the preliminary grounds that their report had no regulatory weight, and the earlier finding was vacated.

In 1998, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the publication by its National Toxicology Program of the 9th Report on Carcinogens, listed environmental tobacco smoke among the known carcinogens, observing of the EPA assessment that &quot;The individual studies were carefully summarized and evaluated.&quot;

==== Tobacco-industry funding of research ====
The tobacco industry&#x27;s role in funding scientific research on secondhand smoke has been controversial. A review of published studies found that tobacco-industry affiliation was strongly correlated with findings exonerating secondhand smoke; researchers affiliated with the tobacco industry were 88 times more likely than independent researchers to conclude that secondhand smoke was not harmful. In a specific example which came to light with the release of tobacco-industry documents, Philip Morris executives successfully encouraged an author to revise his industry-funded review article to downplay the role of secondhand smoke in sudden infant death syndrome. The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General&#x27;s report criticized the tobacco industry&#x27;s role in the scientific debate:

This strategy was outlined at an international meeting of tobacco companies in 1988, at which Philip Morris proposed to set up a team of scientists, organized by company lawyers, to &quot;carry out work on ETS to keep the controversy alive.&quot; All scientific research was subject to oversight and &quot;filtering&quot; by tobacco-industry lawyers:

Philip Morris reported that it was putting &quot;...vast amounts of funding into these projects... in attempting to coordinate and pay so many scientists on an international basis to keep the ETS controversy alive.&quot;

===Tobacco industry response===
Measures to tackle secondhand smoke pose a serious economic threat to the tobacco industry, having broadened the definition of smoking beyond a personal habit to something with a social impact. In a confidential 1978 report, the tobacco industry described increasing public concerns about secondhand smoke as &quot;the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco industry that has yet occurred.&quot; In &quot;United States of America v. Philip Morris et al.&quot;, the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the tobacco industry &quot;... recognized from the mid-1970s forward that the health effects of passive smoking posed a profound threat to industry viability and cigarette profits,&quot; and that the industry responded with &quot;efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that ETS causes disease.&quot;

Accordingly, the tobacco industry have developed several strategies to minimise the impact on their business:
* The industry has sought to position the secondhand smoke debate as essentially concerned with civil liberties and smokers&#x27; rights rather than with health, by funding groups such as FOREST.
* Funding bias in research; in all reviews of the effects of secondhand smoke on health published between 1980 and 1995, the only factor associated with concluding that secondhand smoke is not harmful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry. However, not all studies that failed to find evidence of harm were by industry-affiliated authors.
* Delaying and discrediting legitimate research (see for an example of how the industry attempted to discredit Takeshi Hirayama&#x27;s landmark study, and for an example of how it attempted to delay and discredit a major Australian report on passive smoking)
* Promoting &quot;good epidemiology&quot; and attacking so-called junk science (a term popularised by industry lobbyist Steven Milloy): attacking the methodology behind research showing health risks as flawed and attempting to promote sound science. Ong &amp; Glantz (2001) cite an internal Phillip Morris memo giving evidence of this as company policy.
* Creation of outlets for favourable research. In 1989, the tobacco industry established the International Society of the Built Environment, which published the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Indoor and Built Environment&quot;. This journal did not require conflict-of-interest disclosures from its authors. With documents made available through the Master Settlement, it was found that the executive board of the society and the editorial board of the journal were dominated by paid tobacco-industry consultants. The journal published a large amount of material on passive smoking, much of which was &quot;industry-positive&quot;.

Citing the tobacco industry&#x27;s production of biased research and efforts to undermine scientific findings, the 2006 U.S. Surgeon General&#x27;s report concluded that the industry had &quot;attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus... industry documents indicate that the tobacco industry has engaged in widespread activities... that have gone beyond the bounds of accepted scientific practice.&quot; The U.S. District Court, in &quot;U.S.A. v. Philip Morris et al.&quot;, found that &quot;...despite their internal acknowledgment of the hazards of secondhand smoke, Defendants have fraudulently denied that ETS causes disease.&quot;

==== Position of major tobacco companies ====
The positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of secondhand smoke is somewhat varied. In general, tobacco companies have continued to focus on questioning the methodology of studies showing that secondhand smoke is harmful. Some (such as British American Tobacco and Philip Morris) acknowledge the medical consensus that secondhand smoke carries health risks, while others continue to assert that the evidence is inconclusive. Several tobacco companies advocate the creation of smoke-free areas within public buildings as an alternative to comprehensive smoke-free laws.

=== US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies ===
On September 22, 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a racketeering lawsuit against Philip Morris and other major cigarette manufacturers. Almost 7 years later, on August 17, 2006, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler found that the Government had proven its case and that the tobacco company defendants had violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). In particular, Judge Kessler found that PM and other tobacco companies had:
* conspired to minimize, distort and confuse the public about the health hazards of smoking;
* publicly denied, while internally acknowledging, that secondhand tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers, and
* destroyed documents relevant to litigation.

The ruling found that tobacco companies undertook joint efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that secondhand smoke causes disease, notably by controlling research findings via paid consultants. The ruling also concluded that tobacco companies were fraudulently continuing to deny the health effects of ETS exposure.

On May 22, 2009, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the lower court&#x27;s 2006 ruling.

== Smoke-free laws ==
As a consequence of the health risks associated with secondhand smoke, many national and local governments have outlawed smoking in indoor public places, including restaurants, cafés, and nightclubs, as well as some outdoor open areas. Ireland was the first country in the world to institute a comprehensive national ban on smoking in all indoor workplaces on 29 March 2004. Since then, many others have followed suit. The countries which have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) have a legal obligation to implement &quot;effective&quot; legislation &quot;for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.&quot; (Article 8 of the FCTC) The parties to the FCTC have further adopted &quot;Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to secondhand Smoke&quot; which state that &quot;effective measures to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke ... require the total elimination of smoking and tobacco smoke in a particular space or environment in order to create a 100% smoke-free environment.&quot;

Opinion polls have shown considerable support for smoke-free laws. In June 2007, a survey of 15 countries found 80% approval for such laws. A survey in France, reputedly a nation of smokers, showed 70% support.

=== Effects ===
Smoking bans by governments result in decreased harm from secondhand smoke, including less admissions for acute coronary syndrome. In the first 18 months after the town of Pueblo, Colorado, enacted a smoke-free law in 2003, hospital admissions for heart attacks dropped 27%. Admissions in neighbouring towns without smoke-free laws showed no change, and the decline in heart attacks in Pueblo was attributed to the resulting reduction in secondhand smoke exposure. A 2004 smoking ban instituted in Massachusetts workplaces decreased workers&#x27; secondhand smoke exposure from 8% of workers in 2003 to 5.4% of workers in 2010. A 2016 review also found that bans and policy changes in specific locations such as hospitals or universities can lead to reduced smoking rates. In prison settings bans might lead to reduced mortality and to lower exposure to secondhand smoke.

In 2001, a systematic review for the Guide to Community Preventive Services acknowledged strong evidence of the effectiveness of smoke-free policies and restrictions in reducing expose to secondhand smoke. A follow-up to this review, identified the evidence on which the effectiveness of smoking bans reduced the prevalence of tobacco use. Articles published until 2005, were examined to further support this evidence. The examined studies provided sufficient evidence that smoke-free policies reduce tobacco use among workers when implemented in worksites or by communities.

While a number of studies funded by the tobacco industry have claimed a negative economic impact from smoke-free laws, no independently funded research has shown any such impact. A 2003 review reported that independently funded, methodologically sound research consistently found either no economic impact or a positive impact from smoke-free laws.

Air nicotine levels were measured in Guatemalan bars and restaurants before and after an implemented smoke-free law in 2009. Nicotine concentrations significantly decreased in both the bars and restaurants measured. Also, the employees&#x27; support for a smoke-free workplace substantially increased in the post-implementation survey compared to pre-implementation survey.

=== Public opinion ===
Recent surveys taken by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco demonstrate supportive attitudes of the public towards smoke-free policies in outdoor areas. A vast majority of the public supports restricting smoking in various outdoor settings. The respondents&#x27; support for the policies were for varying reasons such as litter control, establishing positive smoke-free role models for youth, reducing youth opportunities to smoke, and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.

=== Alternative forms ===
Alternatives to smoke-free laws have also been proposed as a means of harm reduction, particularly in bars and restaurants. For example, critics of smoke-free laws cite studies suggesting ventilation as a means of reducing tobacco smoke pollutants and improving air quality. Ventilation has also been heavily promoted by the tobacco industry as an alternative to outright bans, via a network of ostensibly independent experts with often undisclosed ties to the industry. However, not all critics have connections to the industry.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) officially concluded in 2005 that while completely isolated smoking rooms do eliminate the risk to nearby non-smoking areas, smoking bans are the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure. They further concluded that no system of dilution or cleaning was effective at eliminating risk. The U.S. Surgeon General and the European Commission Joint Research Centre have reached similar conclusions. The implementation guidelines for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control states that engineering approaches, such as ventilation, are ineffective and do not protect against secondhand smoke exposure. However, this does not necessarily mean that such measures are useless in reducing harm, only that they fall short of the goal of reducing exposure completely to zero.

Others have suggested a system of tradable smoking pollution permits, similar to the cap-and-trade pollution permits systems used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in recent decades to curb other types of pollution. This would guarantee that a portion of bars/restaurants in a jurisdiction will be smoke-free, while leaving the decision to the market.

==In animals==
Multiple studies have been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco smoke to animals. These studies typically fall under the categories of simulated environmental tobacco smoke, administering condensates of sidestream smoke, or observational studies of cancer among pets.

To simulate environmental tobacco smoke, scientists expose animals to sidestream smoke, that which emanates from the cigarette&#x27;s burning cone and through its paper, or a combination of mainstream and sidestream smoke. The IARC monographs conclude that mice with prolonged exposure to simulated environmental tobacco smoke, that is six hours a day, five days a week, for five months with a subsequent four-month interval before dissection, will have significantly higher incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors than with control groups.

The IARC monographs concluded that sidestream smoke condensates had a significantly higher carcinogenic effect on mice than did mainstream smoke condensates.

===Observational studies===
Secondhand smoke is popularly recognised as a risk factor for cancer in pets. A study conducted by the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Massachusetts Amherst linked the occurrence of feline oral cancer to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke through an overexpression of the p53 gene. Another study conducted at the same universities concluded that cats living with a smoker were more likely to get feline lymphoma; the risk increased with the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke and the number of smokers in the household. A study by Colorado State University researchers, looking at cases of canine lung cancer, was generally inconclusive, though the authors reported a weak relation for lung cancer in dogs exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The number of smokers within the home, the number of packs smoked in the home per day, and the amount of time that the dog spent within the home had no effect on the dog&#x27;s risk for lung cancer.

<text>The Seagull Monument is a historic monument situated immediately east of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Created by artist Mahonri Young, the monument commemorates an 1848 event in which seagulls were observed to devour crop-destroying Mormon crickets, following prayers for divine intervention against the insects. This event is referred to as the miracle of the gulls in the culture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

The work was placed on Temple Square in 1913 and is believed to be the first monument dedicated to birds in the United States.

==Miracle of the gulls==

In 1848, the Mormon pioneers planted crops during their first spring season living in the Salt Lake Valley. As the crops matured, Mormon crickets descended upon the farms and consumed entire fields. The harvest was saved when the pioneer settlers offered prayers to God for assistance, which prayers were believed to be answered when flocks of native seagulls devoured the crickets. This event, popularly called the &quot;miracle of the gulls,&quot; is remembered by Latter-day Saints as a miracle.

==History==
===Creation===
The idea for a monument commemorating the miracle came from George E. Carpenter, an editor at the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, and was inspired by a request he made for Young to create seagull drawings for the 1907 Christmas Edition of the newspaper. After the monument had been conceived of in July 1907, Young had its basic design completed within ten days. During that fall&#x27;s Utah State Fair, a model of the monument was exhibited.

Initially, Young tried to get the church to finance the project, but funds were not available. While the monument was being pitched, there were a number of locations proposed for its placement, including both Temple Square and Liberty Park. The local Manufacturers and Merchants&#x27; Association was very interested in getting the monument erected, and started, in 1908, a subscription list to support its creation. Young made another request to church leadership after he had completed the statues of Joseph and Hyrum Smith for Temple Square in 1909, but the church was constructing the Hotel Utah and again could not support the monument&#x27;s creation. A few years later, and desperate for work, Young approached church leadership once more and pleaded with them to fund the project. This time his request was approved, and in July 1912, the church, represented by Presiding Bishop Charles W. Nibley, signed the contract providing for the creation of the monument, with its placement to be on Temple Square.

The site initially proposed for the monument, just south of the Salt Lake Temple, was not satisfactory to Young, who felt the monument would be dwarfed by the large building. Instead he selected a spot near the Assembly Hall, where the open sky could provide a better background for the monument, and church leaders approved. Excavation for the monument&#x27;s foundation began in April 1913, with the original plan being to dedicate the completed work on July 24 (Pioneer Day in Utah). Eight pieces of granite stone, which made up the base, shaft, and capital of the monument were put in place in June. The granite pieces came from a quarry in Mount Airy, North Carolina and weighed . Towards the end of September, Young arrived with the bronze pieces which were then placed on the monument.

===Dedication===

On October 1, 1913, the monument was dedicated in a ceremony presided over by Bishop Nibley and attended by an estimated 5,000 persons. Prior to the unveiling, three American flags concealed the gulls atop the monument and bronze panels on the pedestal. At 10:50 am, Emmeline B. Wells, president of the church&#x27;s Relief Society, pulled the cords to release the flags, revealing the works of art to the gathered crowd. Wells had witnessed the 1848 miracle as a 21-year-old woman, and she spoke briefly following the unveiling. William W. Riter then gave a history of the miracle, after which the band played The Star-Spangled Banner. The artist was then introduced to the crowd, and thereafter church President Joseph F. Smith addressed the crowd and gave the dedicatory prayer. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir then sang Utah, We Love Thee and Francis M. Lyman closed the ceremony with a benediction.

===Later history===
When first placed on Temple Square, the monument was surrounded by a pool of water which contained water lilies and goldfish. The goldfish, confined in the pool, became easy food for live seagulls. The birds regularly cleared the water of the fish, so in 1944 they were replaced with larger rainbow trout. The trout were fed poisoned wheat by an unknown perpetrator, or perpetrators, on multiple occasions, and eventually fish were removed entirely from the pool.

The pool saw several alterations throughout the years. In 1968, circular fountains were added. For many years, coins tossed into the water were periodically collected and donated by the church to nearby Primary Children&#x27;s Hospital. In 2008, the pool was replaced with a cascading water feature. In early 2024, the entire monument was temporarily removed from Temple Square, to allow for new landscaping as part of the multi-year renovation of the square and the Salt Lake Temple. When it was returned later that year, the pool had been replaced with flower beds and the gold leafing on the seagull sculpture atop the monument had been removed.

The monument is featured in the 1940 film, &quot;Brigham Young&quot;.

==Design==
The monument consists of a granite pedestal with a column topped by a large granite ball. Atop the ball is a bronze sculpture of two seagulls, which measure from wing tip to wing tip. When the monument was first placed on the square, the two seagulls were gilded with gold leaf and a circular pool of water, in diameter and filled with water lilies and goldfish, surrounded the pedestal.

Around the monument&#x27;s pedestal are four bronze relief panels, telling the story of the miracle of the gulls. The first panel, titled &quot;The Founding of the Commonwealth&quot;, depicts the early cultivation and settlement of Salt Lake Valley. It contains a scene with two oxen pulling a plow and behind follows the sower, to the right of the plowing is a woman preparing food near a temporary wagon-box home. Mount Olympus and the Twin Peaks are visible in the background and in the foreground is a seated Native American. The second panel, titled &quot;The Arrival of the Sea Gulls&quot;, features a disheartened pioneer man stooping down, while a woman, holding the hand of a child, looks towards the coming seagulls with hope; the northern end of the Oquirrh Mountains is visible in the background. The third panel, titled &quot;The First Harvest&quot;, depicts the harvesting of the miraculously-preserved crops. A man with a scythe is visible, while there are others binding the sheaves. In the foreground is a nursing mother, with a child and dog at her feet, while the background shows the first home built in the valley, with Ensign Peak above. The fourth panel contains a dedicatory inscription.

<text>Peter Kormos (October 7, 1952 – March 30, 2013) was a politician in Welland, Ontario, Canada. A lawyer by profession, he was first elected as an Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP) Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the Welland constituency in a 1988 provincial by-election. He replaced veteran NDP legislator Mel Swart. Kormos was re-elected in every subsequent Ontario general election until his retirement from provincial politics in 2011.

In 2012, he was elected to Niagara Regional Council in a by-election.

==Early life and education==
Peter Eric Kormos had Slovak and Hungarian origins from his father, Michael, and Belgian origins from mother, Simone. Peter was the third of six children: Michael, Elaine, Peter, Nadine, Mark, and Sam.

Kormos first attained notoriety in the Welland area while still in high school, while president of his student council. Kormos led a sit-in student strike against local administration practices and students&#x27; rights. The week-long strike attracted a small minority of students while classes continued and resulted in Kormos&#x27;s temporary expulsion. He was later educated at Niagara College, York University and Osgoode Hall in Toronto. Called to the bar in 1980, Kormos then worked as a barrister in the Niagara Region.

==Provincial politics==
Kormos was a practicing criminal lawyer, and a local Welland city councillor in 1988, when long-time Welland Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Mel Swart decided to retire for health reasons. Swart was a populist ONDP MPP, in a heavily unionized constituency. The constituency had a long history of electing &quot;populist&quot; politicians, going back to 1951 to Swart&#x27;s predecessor, Ellis Morningstar. The by-election occurred in the middle of two other major elections at the time: the Canadian General election known as the &quot;Free Trade&quot; election, and the Welland city council election. Kormos continued the &quot;populist&quot; approach pioneered by Morningstar and Swart, and won a heated – and what the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called, &quot;[a] vote as dirty as mudwrestling&quot; – election on November 3, 1988.

===In government 1990–1995===
The NDP won government under Bob Rae in the general election of 1990, and Kormos was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations and Minister of Financial Institutions on October 1, 1990. Notably, he was expected to implement a public auto insurance system, one of the promises of the recent election campaign. Rae had mixed feelings about appointing Kormos to his cabinet. He said in his book, &quot;Protest to Power&quot;, &quot;It was better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. The problem was that he ended up inside the tent pissing in.&quot; Once in cabinet Rae described him as &quot;an impossible colleague and even more difficult minister. He missed meetings, threw tantrums, and belittled his colleagues in cabinet committee.&quot;

At the same time Kormos launched a campaign against beer company advertising which he called sexist and exploitative. Somewhat inconsistently, he elicited controversy by appearing, fully clothed, as a &quot;Sunshine Boy&quot; model in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; tabloid. This was anathema to some in the party, because of the Sun&#x27;s politically conservative position and because of the Sunshine Boy&#x27;s place as a parallel to the &quot;Sunshine Girl&quot; franchise, pictures of scantily-clothed women given considerably more prominence than the Sunshine Boy. Due to the situation, Rae fired Kormos from cabinet on March 18, 1991, after he refused to resign.

Rae handed the auto insurance file to Brian Charlton but after considerable discussion, the party backed away from this goal, against considerable opposition from the outspoken Kormos and other party members, including Swart and Kormos&#x27; supporter and fellow MPP Mark Morrow.

For the remainder of Rae&#x27;s term in office, Kormos acted as an unofficial &quot;left opposition&quot; within the NDP caucus, together with Morrow and, until his resignation, Anglican priest Dennis Drainville. In 1993, this group and former cabinet minister Karen Haslam were the only NDP MPPs to vote against the Rae government&#x27;s &quot;Social Contract&quot; legislation.

The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, though Kormos&#x27;s personal popularity was such that he was re-elected without difficulty.

===In opposition 1995–2011===
After Rae&#x27;s retirement, Kormos sought the leadership of the Ontario NDP at the convention held on June 22, 1996. He placed third, behind Frances Lankin and Howard Hampton. He played a &#x27;dark horse&#x27; role by attacking Lankin over her support of the Social Contract. Even though he released his delegates after he lost on the third ballot, his behaviour during the convention was a significant factor in Hampton&#x27;s victory.

In 1996, Kormos was charged with assaulting a security guard at the Family Support Services office in North York, Ontario. Kormos challenged the charges on the basis that the prosecution amounted to an abuse of the court’s process by the Attorney General, but his challenge was dismissed by the court. However, when the case came to trial, the judge dismissed the charges writing that there was only &quot;some incidental contact by Mr. Kormos in order to divert Mr. Subedar&#x27;s attention away from [a] cameraman&#x27;s efforts to film the offices.&quot;

He was widely expected to contest the leadership in 2009, following Hampton&#x27;s retirement, but instead supported the successful candidacy of Andrea Horwath.

Kormos served as House Leader for the Ontario NDP Caucus from 2001 until his retirement in 2011 and also held numerous critic portfolios in Opposition, including Justice, Community Safety and Correctional Services, Consumer and Business Services, Labour, and Democratic Renewal. On June 3, 2011, Kormos announced that he was retiring after 23 years in the legislature.

In 2005, the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada honoured several Ontario MPPs whose support of mentoring programs in their ridings have made a great difference in the organization&#x27;s ability to provide one-on-one mentoring to children and youth. Peter Kormos was one of them.

==Niagara Regional Council==
Kormos was elected to Niagara Regional Council in a municipal by-election on March 26, 2012, filling the seat vacated by Cindy Forster when she won election to succeed Kormos in the Legislative Assembly. He remained a member of the law firm Kormos and Evans. Kormos was an active member of the council until his death, taking part in arrangements for a public meeting, to be held in March 2013 to discuss whether Niagara&#x27;s municipal governments should be amalgamated into a regional government.

==Death==
Peter Kormos had some health problems in the years approaching his death. In 2011, he was absent from the legislature for several months just before the provincial election and he chose not to run again for MPP.

He collapsed in Toronto on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, and was taken to hospital. However, he checked himself out and returned to Welland. Kormos died on the morning of March 30, 2013 at his Welland, Ontario home. The cause of death was not immediately known, although he had been suffering Bell&#x27;s palsy, back pain, and high blood pressure. An autopsy found that foul play was not a factor in his death. The cause of death was not released. Kormos was unmarried and left behind his mother and siblings.

Kormos&#x27; memorial, held in several rooms of a funeral home, attracted hundreds of attendees, including Ontario Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne and Conservative senator Bob Runciman. He was lauded by NDP leader Andrea Horwath for being a heretic in his own party.

==Views==

Kormos represented socialist economic values with a populist, working-class presentation and genuine passion. He was notable for showing up in the provincial legislature in open-neck shirt and cowboy boots, which he stated were made locally under fair working conditions. He opposed the Third Way movement made famous by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

==Biographical book==

In July 2014, Brock University Professor Larry Savage published a biography of Kormos entitled &quot;Socialist Cowboy: The Politics of Peter Kormos&quot;.

<doc id="712587" wikidata="Q1353139" url="?curid=712587" title="Glasgow Caledonian University">
<text>Glasgow Caledonian University, informally GCU, Caledonian or Caley, is a public university in Glasgow, Scotland. It was formed in 1993 by the merger of The Queen&#x27;s College, Glasgow (founded in 1875) and Glasgow Polytechnic (originally Glasgow College of Technology (GCT), founded in 1971). 

It is located in the Cowcaddens district, just to the immediate north of the city centre, and is Glasgow&#x27;s third university, after the University of Glasgow and the University of Strathclyde.

In June 2017, the university&#x27;s New York partner institution, which was founded in 2013, was granted permission to award degrees in the state, the first higher education institution founded by a foreign university to achieve this status. In June 2023, GCU noted that they planned to sell their New York campus as it had not lived up to its potential. On 31 July 2024, it was announced that IE University had acquired Glasgow Caledonian New York College and would be renaming it IE New York College.

==History==

The university traces its origin from &quot;The Queen&#x27;s College, Glasgow&quot; (founded 1875), and the &quot;Glasgow College of Technology&quot; (founded 1971). The Queen&#x27;s College, which specialised in providing training in domestic science, received the royal accolade of being named after Queen Elizabeth II in its centenary celebrations in 1975. Queen Elizabeth was, herself, patron of the college since 1944. Glasgow College of Technology (which changed its name to &quot;Glasgow Polytechnic&quot; in 1991), which was one of the largest central institutions in Scotland, offered externally validated degrees and diplomas in engineering, science, and the humanities: the first of which was a BA in Optics, followed by degrees in Social Sciences (1973) and Nursing (1977).

On 1 April 1993, the two institutions amalgamated to form Glasgow Caledonian University. The new university took its name from Caledonia, the poetic Latin name for present-day Scotland. The main campus of the university is built on the site of the former Buchanan Street Station, built by the Caledonian Railway.

Independent research carried out in 2015 revealed that the university contributes over £480m to Scotland&#x27;s economy each year with the quantifiable lifetime premium of a one-year class of graduates estimated at £400m, bringing the university&#x27;s total annual economic impact to around £880m in Scotland alone.

In July 2018, Annie Lennox was installed as GCU&#x27;s first female chancellor, taking over the role from Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. She was succeeded by entrepreneur and computer scientist Anne-Marie Imafidon in February 2024. Stephen Decent is the principal and vice-chancellor of the university, appointed in 2023.

===Coat of arms and motto===

The university&#x27;s coat of arms is the work of university academic and artist Malcolm Lochhead and draws on four elements from the coat of arms of the university&#x27;s predecessor institutions. The oak tree (of St. Mungo&#x27;s legend) and the Book of Knowledge were borrowed from the arms of Glasgow Polytechnic while the saltire ermine and the crossed keys (intended to represent the &quot;unlocking&quot; of the Book of Knowledge) were taken from the arms of The Queen&#x27;s College. A visual feature was added to the new arms with the illuminated capital letters in the Book&#x27;s paragraphs reading: G C U (the three-letter abbreviation of the university&#x27;s name). The coat of arms was matriculated by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and is inscribed into university degree parchments. The university&#x27;s motto: &quot;for the common weal&quot;, which has been adopted since 1975, features in the full design of the arms.

==Campuses==

GCU&#x27;s main campus is located in the Cowcaddens area of the city, with most of the buildings dating back to the early 1970s and the construction of the Glasgow College of Technology over the former site of Buchanan Street railway station. GCU also operated out of Queens College&#x27; former campus in the Woodlands area of the city on Park Drive, but this was sold to the University of Glasgow in 2001 and everything consolidated on the Cowcaddens site.

In September 2013 the university founded Glasgow Caledonian New York College, which is an independent partner institution whose Wooster Street campus is based in the city&#x27;s SoHo district.
GCU London is the second campus, specialising in Insurance, Banking and Finance, Risk Management, International Fashion Marketing, Luxury Brand Marketing, Public Health and Construction Management. It is home to the British School of Fashion. Based in Fashion Street, Spitalfields, the centre offers a range of MBA and MSc courses. GCU London opened in September 2010 and it is reportedly the first Scottish university to open a base in London. GCU London offers the UK&#x27;s first MBA in Luxury Brand Marketing.

===Administration===

By statute, the university maintains two internal institutions: the University Court and the University Senate. The University Court is the supreme governing body of the university and is composed of a number of &#x27;governors&#x27;, statutory mandated with overseeing its overall strategic direction and appointing both the chancellor and the principal (and vice-chancellor) of the university. The university&#x27;s principal and vice-chancellor and the president of the Students&#x27; Association are ex officio governors of the Court. The University Senate, on the other hand, is statutory tasked with the overall planning, co-ordination, development and supervision of the university&#x27;s academic affairs. University degrees and fellowship as well as academic honours and distinctions are awarded by and in the name of the Court, with the advice of the Senate. The current chair of the Court is Rob Woodward and the Senate is presided over by the university&#x27;s principal and vice-chancellor, currently Stephen Decent.

==Academic profile==

GCU offers academic programmes in all of the Scottish Funding Council funding groups but medicine, dentistry and teacher education. The 2008 Research Assessment Exercise gave the university an &#x27;internationally recognised&#x27; research profile in a multitude of disciplines. Over 70% of the university&#x27;s research submissions were judged as being internationally recognised and 30% were deemed world-leading or of international excellence. In 2015, the QAA awarded the university its highest judgement for academic standards, whilst praising the university&#x27;s innovative academic approaches. In 2013, GCU was awarded the HR Excellence in Research Award by the European Commission, in recognition of its commitment to the development of researchers. This has been retained in 2015 following its two-year review.

===Research ===

According to the Research Excellence Framework, GCU is the top modern university in Scotland by research power. The university&#x27;s social policy research impact at world-leading levels has ranked GCU as in the top 10 in the UK.

The university has three university-wide institutes that engage in cross-disciplinary research: &quot;The Institute for Applied Health Research&quot;, which carries out research on a range of health-related topics; &quot;The Institute for Sustainable Engineering and Technology Research&quot;, which carries out research on a range of disciplines aimed at minimising impact on the environment; and &quot;The Institute for Society and Social Justice Research&quot;, which carries out research on the topics of citizenship and participation, crime and justice, and gender and economy.

The university also has research centres including The Yunus Centre for Social Business and Health, the Centre for Climate Justice and the Women in Scotland&#x27;s (WiSE) Economy Research Centre.

===Rankings===

Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) has been ranked in the world&#x27;s top 150 young universities by the Times Higher Education&#x27;s 200 under age of 50 Rankings 2017

GCU is the top modern university in Scotland for research power (REF 2014 rankings).

According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) UK Performance Indicators in Higher Education, GCU has a completion rate of 80.9 per cent, above the sector average of 80.6 per cent for Scotland.

97% of GCU graduates are in work or further study six months after graduation, according to HESA.

The Times Higher Education 2018 UK Student Experience survey named GCU as the second most improved university in the UK for student experience, up from 99th to joint 67th.

It is also a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association, Universities UK, Universities Scotland, the Florence Network, the Talloires Network, the Erasmus+ Programme, and the Santander Universities Network.

===Magnus Magnusson Fellowship===
The Magnus Magnusson Fellowship, named in honour of former University Chancellor Magnus Magnusson, is an intellectual group based at the university and comprises leading international figures from a variety of backgrounds. The fellowship meets annually to debate and agree action on issues of major concern to society, both locally and globally. It holds an annual lecture that alternates between Glasgow, London, and Reykjavík (Magnusson&#x27;s birthplace).

Muhammad Yunus gave the inaugural Magnusson Fellowship Lecture in 2008 and was formally inducted as one of the first cohort of fellowship members. 

Fellowship members include Will Hutton (Magnusson Fellow, 2010), former President of Ireland Mary Robinson (Magnusson Fellow, 2011), and Renata Salecl (Magnusson Fellow, 2012).

=== Widening access ===
Glasgow Caledonian University is one of only two universities in Scotland to meet the Scottish Government&#x27;s Commission for Widening Access target, which requires students from deprived areas to make up 20 per cent of entrants by 2030.

==Global Networks==

===Oman===

The university has been working with the Caledonian College of Engineering (now the National University of Science and Technology, Oman) since 1996 and offers its largest programme of transnational education there to undergraduate and postgraduate students.

===South Africa===

The university has a history of interaction with South Africa and a number of its leading figures. It was the first university to award Nelson Mandela an honorary doctorate upon his release from prison in 1990 in recognition of his leadership during the anti-apartheid movement. In accepting the honour, Mandela asked the university to offer support for reconstruction and development in South Africa and the university developed in this regard several projects to assist in research and training at a number of South African universities. Mandela officially received the honorary degree in June 1996 at a special ceremony in Buckingham Palace, and suggested the renaming of the university&#x27;s Health Building after his close associate, Govan Mbeki, who was imprisoned in the cell next to him on Robben Island. The Govan Mbeki Building was officially inaugurated by Mbeki&#x27;s son, President Thabo Mbeki, in June 2001 and a specially-commissioned portrait of Nelson Mandela was unveiled that year at the Building&#x27;s foyer by Mandela&#x27;s wife, Graça Machel. The university is also home to two significant scholarly collections on South Africa: the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Scotland Archive and the George Johannes Collection. In 2012, GCU began designing and developing work-based programmes in railway operations management for Transnet Freight Rail, South Africa&#x27;s largest freight rail organisation.

===Cultural Fellows===

The Caledonian Cultural Fellows Initiative was set up in 2009 with the aim of enhancing university cultural life and promoting cultural engagement with wider community. Liz Lochhead, the Scots Makar, is the current honorary president of the fellowship, whose membership includes writer Anne Donovan, poet and novelist Jackie Kay, and artist Toby Paterson.

==Caledonian Club==

The Caledonian Club is a social and community engagement initiative involving staff and students coaching young people and their families in advancing their learning and life skills, while university-based researchers carry out long-term analysis into the process as part of a wider university research agenda into life-long learning. In 2011, the Club developed a project named &#x27;The Tale of Two Sporting Cities&#x27;, with the aim of engaging cultural exchanges between primary schools in Glasgow and London and assessing the sporting and cultural legacy of the 2012 London Summer Olympics and the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Association===
Glasgow Caledonian University Students&#x27; Association (GCUSA) is the students&#x27; association of Glasgow Caledonian University. It represents and enables Glasgow Caledonian University students to enhance all aspects of their student experience. It is located in the Students&#x27; Association Building on the Glasgow Campus and has an office at GCU London. All Glasgow Caledonian University students are automatically admitted to its membership upon matriculation.

In 2011, the Association was awarded the coveted title of Students&#x27; Union of the Year by NUS Scotland.

The Students&#x27; Association runs sports clubs and societies such as, student magazine The EDIT, student radio station Radio Caley, active lifestyles programme and an events programme. At a national level the Students&#x27; Association is affiliated to the National Union of Students (NUS) which lobbies and campaigns for students at a Scottish and UK level.

===Graduation===
GCU holds its annual graduation ceremonies during the summer and autumn and its academic attire is made by robe-maker Ede &amp; Ravenscroft. Under the university&#x27;s academic dress code, the wearing of the customary mortar boards is disallowed, as it is not part of the official academic attire that consists of gowns and hoods only, individual to each award conferred. Graduates traditionally receive their degrees at graduation ceremonies by being &quot;capped&quot; on the head with the Chancellor&#x27;s hat, in a gesture that signifies the Chancellor&#x27;s authority and status within the university. The postnominals for university graduates are prescribed with the abbreviation &quot;GlasCal&quot;.

<text>Vladas Mikėnas (17 April 1910 – 3 November 1992) was a Lithuanian and Soviet chess player and journalist. He was awarded the titles of International Master and Honorary Grandmaster by FIDE.

== Early career ==
Vladas Mikėnas played for Lithuania at first board in five official and one unofficial Chess Olympiads.
* In July 1931, he played at the 4th Chess Olympiad in Prague (+7–5=6).
* In July 1933, he played at the 5th Chess Olympiad in Folkestone (+5–3=6).

<text>Victor Almon McKusick (October 21, 1921 – July 22, 2008) was an American internist and medical geneticist, and Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. He was a proponent of the mapping of the human genome due to its use for studying congenital diseases. He is well known for his studies of the Amish. He was the original author and, until his death, remained chief editor of Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) and its online counterpart Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). He is widely known as the &quot;father of medical genetics&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Victor and his identical twin Vincent L. McKusick were born on October 21, 1921. Victor was one of five children. His father was a graduate of Bates College. Before deciding to work as a dairy farmer, Victor&#x27;s father served as a high school principal in Chester, Vermont. Victor&#x27;s mother had been an elementary school teacher before marrying. Victor and his siblings were raised on a dairy farm in Parkman, Maine.

During the summer of 1937, Victor suffered a severe microaerophilic &quot;Streptococcus&quot; infection in his axilla. As a result, Victor spent time in two hospitals, one of which was Massachusetts General Hospital. He finally saw a successful diagnosis and course of treatment, using sulfanilamide during his ten weeks at Massachusetts General. Since none of his close family were doctors, the events of 1937 represented McKusick&#x27;s first substantial experience with the medical community. He stated, &quot;Perhaps I would have ended up a lawyer if it weren&#x27;t for the &quot;microaerophilic streptococcus&quot;.&quot;

Victor married Anne Bishop McKusick in 1949. Anne served Johns Hopkins Hospital as associate professor of medicine in the Division of Rheumatology. The couple had two sons, Victor and Kenneth, and a daughter, Carol.

== Medical career ==

=== Education ===
After high school, Victor chose to study at Tufts University, and studied there for six semesters from the fall of 1940 to the summer of 1942. Although Tufts had an associated medical school, Victor was fascinated by Johns Hopkins and by its dedication to medical research, and chose to attend Hopkins Medical School instead.

During World War II The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine could not fill its classes. Therefore, for the first time since the school&#x27;s founding in 1893, the school temporarily discontinued requiring a baccalaureate degree for admission. Victor applied during his sixth semester at Tufts, and began in the fall of 1942, as one of the first, of very few, who ever entered the school without a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Victor never earned a baccalaureate degree, although he has been awarded over 20 honorary degrees. He earned his Doctor of Medicine through an accelerated program in only three years. He was offered the prestigious William Osler Internship in Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and chose to remain at Hopkins for his residency. He completed his residency training as a cardiologist, since the department of genetics did not exist at the time. McKusick specialized in heart murmurs, and utilized spectroscopy to analyze heart sounds.

=== Work at Hopkins ===
In 1956 McKusick traveled to Copenhagen to speak about the heritable disorders of connective tissue at the first international congress of human genetics. The meeting looms as the birthplace of the medical genetics field. In the following decades, McKusick went on to head the Chronic Disease Clinic and created and chaired a new Division of Medical Genetics at Hopkins beginning in 1957. In 1973, he served as Physician-in-Chief, William Osler Professor of Medicine, and Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of Medicine. McKusick resigned the appointments in 1985, but continued to teach, conduct research, and practice medicine in the Departments of Medicine and Medical Genetics. He held concurrent appointments as University Professor of Medical Genetics at the McKusick–Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Professor of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Professor of Biology at Johns Hopkins University. 
McKusick played a role in the development of the HeLa cell line that has been instrumental in biomedical research, although he did not reveal to the Lacks family all the details about subsequent blood draws which were for genotyping HeLa.
He held numerous faculty appointments while remaining at Johns Hopkins until his death in 2008.

=== Organizations ===
In 1960, McKusick founded and co-directed the Annual Short Course in Medical and Experimental Mammalian Genetics at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. He published &quot;Mendelian Inheritance in Man&quot; &quot;(MIM)&quot;, which was the first published catalog of all known genes and genetic disorders, in 1966. The complete text of &quot;MIM &quot;was made available online free of charge beginning in 1987, and titled &quot;Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)&quot;. The 12th and final print edition was published in 1998. The online database is continually updated, and linked with the National Center for Biotechnology Information. &quot;OMIM&quot; is distributed through the National Library of Medicine, and has been a part of the Entrez database network system since 1995. At the time of McKusick&#x27;s death, &quot;OMIM&quot; contained 18,847 entries. He also led the Annual Course in Medical Genetics at the University of Bologna Residential Center in Bertinoro di Romagna, Italy in 1987. McKusick was founding president of the Human Genome Organization in 1989.

=== Publications and research ===
McKusick wrote extensively on the history of medicine, genetics, medical genetics, and about Parkman, Maine. He co-founded &quot;Genomics&quot; in 1987 with Frank Ruddle, and served as an editor. He led a Congressionally-chartered committee examining the ethics of testing Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s tissue for the presence of Marfan syndrome genes.

His well-known published articles include:
* &quot;Probable Assignment of the Duffy Blood Group Locus to Chromosome 1 in Man&quot; (1968)
*&quot;The Anatomy of the Human Genome: a Neo-Vesalian Basis for Medicine in the 21st Century&quot; (2001)
* &quot;On lumpers and splitters, or the nosology of genetic disease.&quot;

In a 2005 paper presented by M.I. Poling, McKusick said:

I have always told my students, residents, and fellows, if you want to really get on top of some topic, you need to know how it got from where it was to how it is now. I was always strong on eponyms, too—like Marfan syndrome, Freeman–Sheldon syndrome, Down syndrome, Tay–Sachs disease, etc. On rounds, the resident or student would present a patient with some particular condition, and I would always ask, so who is so and so for whom the disease was named. This prompts thought and research into the disease or condition itself to find out who first described it and, therefore, for whom it was named.

=== Study of genes among the Amish ===
McKusick&#x27;s study of genetics among the Amish is perhaps his most famous research. On his first trip to Amish homes, he was accompanied by David Krusen who had an extensive medical practice among the Amish in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McKusick spoke about his introduction to Krusen&#x27;s work, stating, &quot;He [Krusen] indicated to the author of the article—in a slick-paper, pharmaceutical company &#x27;throw-away&#x27;—that achondroplasia is frequent among the Amish. Initial study led to the identification of two recessive conditions named Ellis–van Creveld syndrome and cartilage-hair hypoplasia (later named metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, McKusick type).

McKusick listed fifteen advantages to studying genetics among the Amish. Today, these fifteen reasons are argued to be true as well. McKusick&#x27;s findings led many other researchers to study hereditary related diseases in the 1960s and 1970s. Other researchers and McKusick cite the Amish as working cooperatively with researchers to determine the reason for inherited diseases. McKusick published his official findings from working with the Amish in 1978, titled &quot;Medical Genetic Studies of the Amish&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
McKusick received more than 20 honorary degrees throughout and after his career. He was also a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Some of the awards he won are listed below:
* Gairdner International Award from The Gairdner Foundation in 1977.
* William Allan Award from The American Society of Human Genetics in 1977.
* NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences in 1982.
* George M. Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians in 1990.
* Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences from the American Philosophical Society in 1996.
* Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science from The Lasker Foundation in 1997.
* Japan Prize for Medical Genetics, for pioneering the field of medical genetics, in 2008 from The Japan Prize Foundation.
* McKusick–Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital named after McKusick and fellow distinguished geneticist Daniel Nathans.

== Death ==
McKusick died of cancer at the age of 86, on July 22, 2008. He died at his home right outside of Baltimore, in Towson, Maryland. On the 21st, the day before he died, he watched a live-stream of a course on medical genetics from Bar Harbor, Maine, which he helped found and direct in 1960.

<text>The F-1 is a rocket engine developed by Rocketdyne. The engine uses a gas-generator cycle developed in the United States in the late 1950s and was used in the Saturn V rocket in the 1960s and early 1970s. Five F-1 engines were used in the S-IC first stage of each Saturn V, which served as the main launch vehicle of the Apollo program. The F-1 remains the most powerful single combustion chamber liquid-propellant rocket engine ever developed.

== History ==
Rocketdyne developed the F-1 and the E-1 to meet a 1955 U.S. Air Force requirement for a very large rocket engine. The E-1, although successfully tested in static firing, was quickly seen as a technological dead-end, and was abandoned for the larger, more powerful F-1. The Air Force eventually halted development of the F-1 because of a lack of requirement for such a large engine. However, the recently created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) appreciated the usefulness of an engine with so much power and contracted Rocketdyne to complete its development. Test firings of F-1 components had been performed as early as 1957. The first static firing of a full-stage developmental F-1 was performed in March 1959. The first F-1 was delivered to NASA MSFC in October 1963. In December 1964, the F-1 completed flight rating tests. Testing continued at least through 1965.

Early development tests revealed serious combustion instability problems which sometimes caused catastrophic failure. Initially, progress on this problem was slow, as it was intermittent and unpredictable. Oscillations of 4 kHz with harmonics to 24 kHz were observed. Eventually, engineers developed a diagnostic technique of detonating small explosive charges (which they called &quot;bombs&quot;) outside the combustion chamber, through a tangential tube (RDX, C-4 or black powder were used) while the engine was firing. This allowed them to determine exactly how the running chamber responded to variations in pressure, and to determine how to nullify these oscillations. The designers could then quickly experiment with different co-axial fuel-injector designs to obtain the one most resistant to instability. These problems were addressed from 1959 through 1961. Eventually, engine combustion was so stable, it would self-damp artificially induced instability within one-tenth of a second.

== Design ==
The F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle liquid-fueled rocket engine ever flown. The M-1 rocket engine was designed to have more thrust, but it was only tested at the component level. The later developed RD-170 is much more stable, technologically more advanced, more efficient and produces more thrust, but uses four nozzles fed by a single pump. The F-1 burned RP-1 (rocket grade kerosene) as the fuel and used liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. A turbopump was used to inject fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber.

One notable challenge in the construction of the F-1 was regenerative cooling of the thrust chamber. Chemical engineer Dennis &quot;Dan&quot; Brevik was faced with the task of ensuring the preliminary combustion chamber tube bundle and manifold design produced by Al Bokstellar would run cool. In essence, Brevik&#x27;s job was to &quot;make sure it doesn’t melt.&quot; Through Brevik&#x27;s calculations of the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the F-1, he and his team were able to fix an issue known as ‘starvation’. This is when an imbalance of static pressure leads to &#x27;hot spots&#x27; in the manifolds. The material used for the F-1 thrust chamber tube bundle, reinforcing bands and manifold was Inconel-X750, a refractory nickel based alloy capable of withstanding high temperatures.

The heart of the engine was the thrust chamber, which mixed and burned the fuel and oxidizer to produce thrust. A domed chamber at the top of the engine served as a manifold supplying liquid oxygen to the injectors, and also served as a mount for the gimbal bearing which transmitted the thrust to the body of the rocket. Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the thrust chamber in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion. Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the thrust chamber — which formed approximately the upper half of the exhaust nozzle — and back in order to cool the nozzle.

A gas generator was used to drive a turbine which drove separate fuel and oxygen pumps, each feeding the thrust chamber assembly. The turbine was driven at 5,500 RPM, producing . The fuel pump delivered of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered of liquid oxygen per minute. Environmentally, the turbopump was required to withstand temperatures ranging from input gas at to liquid oxygen at . Structurally, fuel was used to lubricate and cool the turbine bearings.
Below the thrust chamber was the nozzle extension, roughly half the length of the engine. This extension increased the expansion ratio of the engine from 10:1 to 16:1. The exhaust from the turbine was fed into the nozzle extension by a large, tapered manifold; this relatively cool gas formed a film which protected the nozzle extension from the hot () exhaust gas.

Each second, a single F-1 burned of oxidizer and fuel: of liquid oxygen and of RP-1, generating of thrust. This equated to a flow rate of per second; of LOX and of RP-1. During their two and a half minutes of operation, the five F-1s propelled the Saturn V vehicle to a height of and a speed of . The combined flow rate of the five F-1s in the Saturn V was or per second. Each F-1 engine had more thrust than three Space Shuttle Main Engines combined.

===Pre and post ignition procedures===
During static test firing, the kerosene-based RP-1 fuel left hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine post test firing. These had to be removed from the engine to avoid problems during engine handling and future firing, and the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) was used to clean the engine&#x27;s fuel system immediately before and after each test firing. The cleaning procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine&#x27;s fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30–35 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits. Sometimes the engine&#x27;s gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing. The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.

=== F-1 improvements ===
F-1 thrust and efficiency were improved between Apollo 8 (SA-503) and Apollo 17 (SA-512), which was necessary to meet the increasing payload capacity demands of later Apollo missions. There were small performance variations between engines on a given mission, and variations in average thrust between missions. For Apollo 15, F-1 performance was:

*Thrust (average, per engine, sea level liftoff): 
*Burn time: 159 seconds
*Specific impulse: 
*Mixture ratio: 2.2674
*S-IC total sea level liftoff thrust: 

Measuring and making comparisons of rocket engine thrust is more complicated than it may first appear. Based on actual measurement the liftoff thrust of Apollo 15 was , which equates to an average F-1 thrust of – slightly more than the specified value.

=== F-1A after Apollo ===
During the 1960s, Rocketdyne undertook uprating development of the F-1 resulting in the new engine specification F-1A. While outwardly very similar to the F-1, the F-1A produced about 20% greater thrust, in tests, and would have been used on future Saturn V vehicles in the post-Apollo era. However, the Saturn V production line was closed prior to the end of Project Apollo and no F-1A engines ever flew.

There were proposals to use eight F-1 engines on the first stage of the Saturn C-8 and Nova rockets. Numerous proposals have been made from the 1970s and on to develop new expendable boosters based around the F-1 engine design. These include the Saturn-Shuttle, and the Pyrios booster (see below) in 2013. , none have proceeded beyond the initial study phase. The Comet HLLV would have used five F-1A engines on the main core and two on each of the boosters.

The F-1 is the largest, highest-thrust single-chamber, single-nozzle liquid-fuel engine flown. Larger solid-fuel engines exist, such as the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster with a sea-level liftoff thrust of apiece. The Soviet (now Russian) RD-170 can develop more thrust than the F-1, at per engine at sea level, however, each engine uses four combustion chambers instead of one, to solve the combustion instability problem.

==F-1B booster==

As part of the Space Launch System (SLS) program, NASA had been running the Advanced Booster Competition, which was scheduled to end with the selection of a winning booster configuration in 2015. In 2013, engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center began tests with an original F-1, serial number F-6049, which was removed from Apollo 11 due to a glitch. The engine was never used, and for many years it was at the Smithsonian Institution. The tests are designed to refamiliarize NASA with the design and propellants of the F-1 in anticipation of using an evolved version of the engine in future deep-space flight applications.

In 2012, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rocketdyne, and Dynetics, Inc. presented a competitor known as Pyrios, a liquid rocket booster, in NASA&#x27;s Advanced Booster Program, which aims to find a more powerful successor to the five-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters intended for early versions of the Space Launch System. Pyrios uses two increased-thrust and heavily modified F-1B engines per booster. Due to the engine&#x27;s potential advantage in specific impulse, if this F-1B configuration (using four F-1Bs in total) were integrated with the SLS Block 2, the vehicle could deliver to low Earth orbit, while is what is regarded as achievable with the planned solid boosters combined with a four-engine RS-25 core stage.

The F-1B engine has a design goal to be at least as powerful as the unflown F-1A, while also being more cost effective. The design incorporates a greatly simplified combustion chamber, a reduced number of engine parts, and the removal of the F-1 exhaust recycling system, including the turbine exhaust mid-nozzle and the &quot;curtain&quot; cooling manifold, with the turbine exhaust having a separate outlet passage beside the shortened main nozzle on the F-1B. The reduction in parts costs is aided by using selective laser melting in the production of some metallic parts. The resulting F-1B engine is intended to produce of thrust at sea level, a 15% increase over the approximate of thrust that the mature Apollo 15 F-1 engines produced.
==Locations of F-1 engines==

Sixty-five F-1 engines were launched aboard thirteen Saturn Vs, and each first stage landed in the Atlantic Ocean. Ten of these followed approximately the same flight azimuth of 72 degrees, but Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 followed significantly more southerly azimuths (80.088 degrees and 91.503 degrees, respectively). The Skylab launch vehicle flew at a more northerly azimuth to reach a higher inclination orbit (50 degrees versus the usual 32.5 degrees).

Ten F-1 engines were installed on two production Saturn Vs that never flew. The first stage from SA-514 is on display at the Johnson Space Center in Houston (although owned by the Smithsonian) and the first stage from SA-515 is on display at the INFINITY Science Center at John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.

Another ten engines were installed on two ground-test Saturn Vs never intended to fly. The S-IC-T &quot;All Systems Test Stage,&quot; a ground-test replica, is on display as the first stage of a complete Saturn V at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SA-500D, the Dynamic Test Vehicle, is on display at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

A test engine is on display at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia. It was the 25th out of 114 research and development engines built by Rocketdyne and it was fired 35 times. The engine is on loan to the museum from the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. It is the only F-1 on display outside the United States.

An F-1 engine, on loan from the National Air and Space Museum, is on display at the Air Zoo in Portage, Michigan.

An F-1 engine is on a horizontal display stand at Science Museum Oklahoma in Oklahoma City.

F-1 engine F-6049 is displayed vertically at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington as part of the Apollo exhibit.

An F-1 engine is installed vertically as a memorial to the Rocketdyne builders on De Soto Avenue, across the street from the former Rocketdyne plant in Canoga Park, California. It was installed in 1979, and moved from the parking lot across the street some time after 1980.

An F-1 Engine is on display outside of The New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

A recovered F-1 thrust chamber is on display at the Cosmosphere. An intact engine (without nozzle extension) is displayed outdoors.

===Recovery===

On March 28, 2012, a team funded by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, reported that they had located the F-1 rocket engines from an Apollo mission using sonar equipment. Bezos stated he planned to raise at least one of the engines, which rest at a depth of , about east of Cape Canaveral, Florida. However, the condition of the engines, which had been submerged for more than 40 years, was unknown. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden released a statement congratulating Bezos and his team for their find and wished them success. He also affirmed NASA&#x27;s position that any recovered artifacts would remain property of the agency, but that they would likely be offered to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums, depending on the number recovered.

On March 20, 2013, Bezos announced he had succeeded in bringing parts of an F-1 engine to the surface, and released photographs. Bezos noted, &quot;Many of the original serial numbers are missing or partially missing, which is going to make mission identification difficult. We might see more during restoration.&quot; The recovery ship was &quot;Seabed Worker&quot;, and had on board a team of specialists organized by Bezos for the recovery effort. On July 19, 2013, Bezos revealed that the serial number of one of the recovered engines is Rocketdyne serial number 2044 (equating to NASA number 6044), the #5 (center) engine that helped Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to reach the Moon with the Apollo 11 mission. The recovered parts were brought to the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson for the process of conservation.

In August 2014, it was revealed that parts of two different F-1 engines were recovered, one from Apollo 11 and one from another Apollo flight, while a photograph of a cleaned-up engine was released. Bezos plans to put the engines on display at various places, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

On May 20, 2017, the Apollo permanent exhibit opened at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA and displays engine artifacts recovered including the thrust chamber and thrust chamber injector of the number 3 engine from the Apollo 12 mission, as well as a gas generator from an engine that powered the Apollo 16 flight.

<doc id="712617" wikidata="Q1532594" url="?curid=712617" title="Power rating">
<text>In electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, the power rating of equipment is the highest power input allowed to flow through particular equipment. According to the particular discipline, the term &quot;power&quot; may refer to electrical or mechanical power. A power rating can also involve average and maximum power, which may vary depending on the kind of equipment and its application.

Power rating limits are usually set as a guideline by the manufacturers, protecting the equipment, and simplifying the design of larger systems, by providing a level of operation under which the equipment will not be damaged while allowing for a certain safety margin.

== Equipment types ==

=== Dissipative equipment ===

In equipment that primarily dissipates electric power or converts it into mechanical power, such as resistors, and speakers, the power rating given is usually the maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the equipment. The usual reason for this limit is heat, although in certain electromechanical devices, particularly speakers, it is to prevent mechanical damage. When heat is the limiting factor, the power rating is easily calculated. First, the amount of heat that can be safely dissipated by the device, formula_1, must be calculated. This is related to the maximum safe operating temperature, the ambient temperature or temperature range in which the device will be operated, and the method of cooling. If formula_2 is the maximum safe operating temperature of the device, formula_3 is the ambient temperature, and formula_4 is the total thermal resistance between the device and ambient, then the maximum heat dissipation is given by
:formula_5
If all power in a device is dissipated as heat, then this is also the power rating.

=== Mechanical equipment ===
Equipment is generally rated by the power it will deliver, for example, at the shaft of an electric or hydraulic motor. The power input to the equipment will be greater owing to the less than 100% efficiency of the device. Efficiency of a device is often defined as the ratio of output power to the sum of output power and losses. In some types of equipment, it is possible to measure or calculate losses directly. This allows efficiency to be calculated with greater precision than the quotient of input power over output power, where relatively small measurement uncertainty will greatly affect the resulting calculated efficiency.

=== Power converting equipment===
In devices that primarily convert between different forms of electric power, such as transformers, or transport it from one location to another, such as transmission lines, the power rating almost always refers to the maximum power flow through the device, not dissipation within it. The usual reason for the limit is heat, and the maximum heat dissipation is calculated as above.

Power ratings are usually given in watts for real power and volt-amperes for apparent power, although for devices intended for use in large power systems, both may be given in a per-unit system. Cables are usually rated by giving their maximum voltage and their ampacity. As the power rating depends on the method of cooling, different ratings may be specified for air cooling, water cooling, etc.

== Average vs. maximum ==
For AC-operated devices (e.g. coaxial cable, loudspeakers), there may even be two power ratings, a maximum (peak) power rating and an average power rating. For such devices, the peak power rating usually specifies the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average power rating limits high-frequency operation. Average power calculation rating depends on some assumptions about how the device is going to be used. For example, the EIA rating method for loudspeakers uses a shaped noise signal that simulates music and allows peak excursion of 6 dB, so an EIA rating of 50 Watts corresponds to 200 Watts peak rating.

== Maximum continuous rating ==
Maximum continuous rating (MCR) is defined as the maximum output (MW) that an electric power generating station is capable of producing continuously under normal conditions over a year. Under ideal conditions, the actual output could be higher than the MCR.

Within shipping, ships usually operate at the nominal continuous rating (NCR) which is 85% of the 90% of MCR. The 90% MCR is usually the contractual output for which the propeller is designed. Thus, the usual output at which ships are operated is around 75% to 77% of MCR.

== Other definitions ==
In some fields of engineering, even a more complex set of power ratings is used. For example, helicopter engines are rated for continuous power (which does not have a time constraint), takeoff and hover power rating (defined as half to one-hour operation), maximum contingency power (which can be sustained for two-three minutes), and emergency (half a minute) power rating.
For electrical motors, a similar kind of information is conveyed by the &quot;service factor&quot;, which is a multiplier that, when applied to the rated output power, gives the power level a motor can sustain for shorter periods of time. The service factor is typically in the 1.15-1.4 range, with the figure being lower for higher-power motors. For every hour of operation at the service-factor-adjusted power rating, a motor loses two to three hours of life at nominal power, i.e. its service life is reduced to less than half for continued operation at this level. The service factor is defined in the ANSI/NEMA MG 1 standard, and is generally used in the United States. There is no IEC standard for the service factor.

Exceeding the power rating of a device by more than the margin of safety set by the manufacturer usually does damage to the device by causing its operating temperature to exceed safe levels. In semiconductors, irreparable damage can occur very quickly. Exceeding the power rating of most devices for a very short period of time is not harmful, although doing so regularly can sometimes cause cumulative damage.

Power ratings for electrical apparatus and transmission lines are a function of the duration of the proposed load and the ambient temperature; a transmission line or transformer, for example, can carry significantly more load in cold weather than in hot weather. Momentary overloads, causing high temperatures and deterioration of insulation, may be considered an acceptable trade-off in emergency situations. The power rating of switching devices varies depending on the circuit voltage as well as the current. In certain aerospace or military applications, a device may carry a much higher rating than would be accepted in devices intended to operate for long service life.

== Examples ==

=== Audio amplifiers ===
Audio amplifier power ratings are typically established by driving the device under test to the onset of clipping, to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield a higher rating than driving it to 0.01% distortion levels. Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single mid-range frequency, or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield a higher rating than if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working. Manufacturers can use these methods to market amplifiers whose published maximum power output includes some amount of clipping in order to show higher numbers.

For instance, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) established an amplifier rating system in which the device is tested with both channels driven throughout its advertised frequency range, at no more than its published distortion level. The Electronic Industries Association (EIA) rating system, however, determines amplifier power by measuring a single channel at 1,000 Hz, with a 1% distortion level—1% clipping. Using the EIA method rates an amplifier 10 to 20% higher than the FTC method.

=== Photovoltaic modules ===
The nominal power of a photovoltaic module is determined by measuring current and voltage while varying resistance under defined illumination. The conditions are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically, the light intensity is 1000 W/m2, with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the Earth&#x27;s surface at latitude 35° N in the summer (airmass 1.5) and temperature of the cells at 25 °C. The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between open and closed circuit.

The maximum power measured is the nominal power of the module in Watts. Colloquially, this is also written as &quot;Wp&quot;; this format is colloquial as it is outside the standard by adding suffixes to standardized units. The nominal power divided by the light power that falls on the module (area x 1000 W/m2) is the &quot;efficiency&quot;.

<text>Manfred Bietak (born in Vienna, 6 October 1940) is an Austrian archaeologist. He is professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Vienna, working as the principal investigator for an ERC Advanced Grant Project &quot;The Hyksos Enigma&quot; and editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Ägypten und Levante&quot; (&quot;Egypt and the Levant&quot;) and of four series of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Oriental and European Archaeology (2016–2020). 

==Specialty==
Bietak is best known as the director of the Austrian excavations at two sites in the Nile Delta: Tell El-Dab&#x27;a, which was identified as the location of Avaris, the capital of the Hyksos period; and Piramesse, which was the capital of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The site was also most probably the naval base Peru-nefer of Thutmosis III and Amenhotep II. A palace precinct of those kings, furnished with Minoan frescoes was one of the most important discoveries. Bietak has also conducted excavations in western Thebes (Luqsor), where he discovered the huge tomb of Ankh-Hor, Chief steward of the Divine Wife of Amun Nitokris (26th Dynasty). Since 2013 he conducts excavations at the Middle Kingdom Palace at Bubastis.

==Career==
Bietak studied archeology at University of Vienna, obtaining his Dr. phil. in 1964 and an honorary PhD. in 2009. In 1961–1964, he took part in the archaeological rescue expedition of UNESCO at Sayala in Nubia, and he also supervised excavations there; in 1965 he was the director of the expedition. During 1966–1972, he was the scientific secretary and later the scientific counsellor at the Austrian Embassy in Cairo. In 1973, he founded the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo; he has been the director of the institute until 2009.

Bietak is the founder and director of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo 1973–2009. He was chairman of the Institute of Egyptology (1984–2009) and of the Vienna Institute of Archaeological Science (2004–2011) at the University of Vienna and chairman of the Commission for Egypt and the Levant at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. From 1999 to 2011, he was also founder and first speaker of the Special Research Programme (SFB) &quot;Synchronisation of Civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Second Millennium BC – SCIEM 2000&quot; at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1997 and 2006, he was visiting professor at the Collège de France; in 2004, he was Martha Whitcomb visiting professor at Harvard; between 2016 and 2017 he was guest scholar at the Getty Research Institute at Malibu, California. He is professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Vienna.

==Affiliations==
Bietak has been elected to several scholarly institutions: Foreign Honorary Member of the Archaeological Institute of America; Full Member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences; Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy; Full Member of German Archaeological Institute; Membre titulaire de l&#x27;Institut d&#x27;Égypte; Foreign Fellow of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters; Membre associé de l&#x27;Institut de France : Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres; Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; Foreign Member of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Gothenburg; Foreign Fellow of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Foreign Fellow of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Cambridge, Ma. He is also a member of the following: Council of the International Union of Egyptologists (1976–2013); Scientific Committee of the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East; Visiting Committee of the Egyptian Department of the Metropolitan Museum of New York.

Additionally, he has supervised or reviewed at least 40 PhD dissertations and at least 18 Masters theses, at the universities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Cambridge, Copenhagen, Göttingen, Hamburg, Helwan, London, Vienna.

In 2006, there was a three-volume &quot;Festschrift&quot; published in his honour. The &quot;Festschrift&quot; includes a list of works that Bietak authored or co-authored up to 2006: 21 monographs, 164 research articles, and 17 review articles. Bietak has also edited or co-edited 8 periodicals, including the Egyptological journal &quot;Egypt and the Levant&quot;.

In 2015, Bietak won from the European Research Council an ERC Advanced Grant &quot;The Hyksos Enigma&quot; and is principal investigator and head of this project which is accommodated at the Austrian Academy of Sciences and at the Bournemouth University, UK. This project explores the origins of western Asiatic populations in the Nile Delta during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1800 BC) and the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1800–1530 BC) and how the Hyksos seized power in Lower Egypt. Research also is focused on the reasons for the decline and failure of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty and its lasting impact on the Egyptian culture of the New Kingdom.

<text>The Laponian area is a large mountainous wildlife area in the Lapland province in northern Sweden, more precisely in Gällivare Municipality, Arjeplog Municipality and Jokkmokk Municipality. The name comes from the Latin name for Lapland.

It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996; the bulk of it had enjoyed protected status since the early 20th century. The area was made a heritage site for both natural and cultural reasons.

The total area is about , making it the world&#x27;s largest unmodified nature area to be still cultured by natives—the natives in this case being the reindeer-herding Sami people. Only parts of the area is actually used for pasture by them. With such a large space, the geography of the area varies greatly; it is dominated by mountains, rivers and lakes. Each nature reserve and national park has its distinctive features. The amount of snow in winter and rain in summer is considerable.

95% of the area is protected as national parks or nature reserves. It consists of the national parks Muddus, Sarek, Padjelanta and Stora Sjöfallet, and the nature reserves Sjaunja and Stubba. The remaining 5% are located in the areas of Sulitelma, Tjuoltadalen, and Rapadalen (part of which is in the Sarek park).

The village of Porjus is a natural point of entry to the Laponian area and has recently opened an information center.

The Laponia area also contains three major hydropower stations with belonging basins and a big expansion of 100 wind power stations inside the world heritage area is planned.

The highest mountain of the area is Sarektjåhkkå, at .

<doc id="712625" wikidata="Q1133195" url="?curid=712625" title="Scree">
<text>Scree is a collection of broken rock fragments at the base of a cliff or other steep rocky mass that has accumulated through periodic rockfall. Landforms associated with these materials are often called talus deposits.

The term &quot;scree&quot; is applied both to an unstable steep mountain slope composed of rock fragments and other debris, and to the mixture of rock fragments and debris itself. It is loosely synonymous with talus, material that accumulates at the base of a projecting mass of rock, or talus slope, a landform composed of talus. The term &quot;scree&quot; is sometimes used more broadly for any sheet of loose rock fragments mantling a slope, while &quot;talus&quot; is used more narrowly for material that accumulates at the base of a cliff or other rocky slope from which it has obviously eroded.

Scree is formed by rockfall, which distinguishes it from [[colluvium]]. Colluvium is rock fragments or soil deposited by rainwash, sheetwash, or slow downhill creep, usually at the base of gentle slopes or hillsides. However, the terms &quot;scree&quot;, &quot;talus&quot;, and sometimes &quot;colluvium&quot; tend to be used interchangeably. The term &quot;talus deposit&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish the landform from the material of which it is made. The exact definition of scree in the primary literature is somewhat relaxed, and it often overlaps with both &quot;talus&quot; and &quot;colluvium&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;scree&quot; comes from the Old Norse term for landslide, &quot;skriða&quot;, while the term &quot;talus&quot; is a French word meaning a slope or embankment.

==Description==
Talus deposits typically have a concave upwards form, where the maximum inclination corresponds to the angle of repose of the mean debris particle size.

Scree slopes are often assumed to be close to the angle of repose. This is the slope at which a pile of granular material becomes mechanically unstable. However, careful examination of scree slopes shows that only those that are either rapidly accumulating new material, or are experiencing rapid removal of material from their bases, are close to the angle of repose. Most scree slopes are less steep, and they often show a concave shape, so that the foot of the slope is less steep than the top of the slope.

Scree with large, boulder-sized rock fragments may form talus caves, or human-sized passages formed in-between boulders.

==Formation==
The formation of scree and talus deposits is the result of physical and chemical weathering acting on a rock face, and erosive processes transporting the material downslope. In high-altitude arctic and subarctic regions, scree slopes and talus deposits are typically adjacent to hills and river valleys. These steep slopes usually originate from late-Pleistocene periglacial processes.

There are five main stages of scree slope evolution:
# accumulation
# consolidation
# weathering
# encroaching vegetation
# slope degradation.

Scree slopes form as a result of accumulated loose, coarse-grained material. Within the scree slope itself, however, there is generally good sorting of sediment by size: larger particles accumulate more rapidly at the bottom of the slope. Cementation occurs as fine-grained material fills in gaps between debris. The speed of consolidation depends on the composition of the slope; clayey components will bind debris together faster than sandy ones. Should weathering outpace the supply of sediment, plants may take root. Plant roots diminish cohesive forces between the coarse and fine components, degrading the slope. The predominant processes that degrade a rock slope depend largely on the regional climate (see below), but also on the thermal and topographic stresses governing the parent rock material. Example process domains include:
* Physical weathering
* Chemical weathering
* Biotic processes
* Thermal stresses
* Topographic stresses

===Physical weathering processes===
Scree formation is commonly attributed to the formation of ice within mountain rock slopes. The presence of joints, fractures, and other heterogeneities in the rock wall can allow precipitation, groundwater, and surface runoff to flow through the rock. If the temperature drops below the freezing point of the fluid contained within the rock, during particularly cold evenings, for example, this water can freeze. Since water expands by 9% when it freezes, it can generate large forces that either create new cracks or wedge blocks into an unstable position. Special boundary conditions (rapid freezing and water confinement) may be required for this to happen. Freeze-thaw scree production is thought to be most common during the spring and fall, when the daily temperatures fluctuate around the freezing point of water, and snow melt produces ample free water.

The efficiency of freeze-thaw processes in scree production is a subject of ongoing debate. Many researchers believe that ice formation in large open fracture systems cannot generate high enough pressures to force the fracturing apart of parent rocks, and instead suggest that the water and ice simply flow out of the fractures as pressure builds. Many argue that frost heaving, like that known to act in soil in permafrost areas, may play an important role in cliff degradation in cold places.

Eventually, a rock slope may be completely covered by its own scree, so that production of new material ceases. The slope is then said to be &quot;mantled&quot; with debris. However, since these deposits are still unconsolidated, there is still a possibility of the deposit slopes themselves failing. If the talus deposit pile shifts and the particles exceed the angle of repose, the scree itself may slide and fail.

===Chemical weathering processes===
Phenomena such as acid rain may also contribute to the chemical degradation of rocks and produce more loose sediments.

===Biotic weathering processes===
Biotic processes often intersect with both physical and chemical weathering regimes, as the organisms that interact with rocks can mechanically or chemically alter them.

Lichen frequently grow on the surface of, or within, rocks. Particularly during the initial colonization process, the lichen often inserts its hyphae into small fractures or mineral cleavage planes that exist in the host rock. As the lichen grows, the hyphae expand and force the fractures to widen. This increases the potential of fragmentation, possibly leading to rockfalls. During the growth of the lichen thallus, small fragments of the host rock can be incorporated into the biological structure and weaken the rock.
Freeze-thaw action of the entire lichen body due to microclimatic changes in moisture content can alternately cause thermal contraction and expansion, which also stresses the host rock. Lichen also produce a number of organic acids as metabolic byproducts. These often react with the host rock, dissolving minerals, and breaking down the substrate into unconsolidated sediments.

==Interaction with glaciers==
Scree often collects at the base of glaciers, concealing them from their environment. For example, Lech dl Dragon, in the Sella group of the Dolomites, is derived from the melting waters of a glacier and is hidden under a thick layer of scree. Debris cover on a glacier affects the energy balance and, therefore, the melting process. Whether the glacier ice begins melting more rapidly or more slowly is determined by the thickness of the layer of scree on its surface.

The amount of energy reaching the surface of the ice below the debris can be estimated via the one-dimensional, homogeneous material assumption of Fourier&#x27;s law:

formula_1,

where &quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity of the debris material, &quot;Ts&quot; is the ambient temperature above the debris surface, &quot;Ti&quot; is the temperature at the lower surface of the debris, and &quot;d&quot; is the thickness of the debris layer.

Debris with a low thermal conductivity value, or a high thermal resistivity, will not efficiently transfer energy through to the glacier, meaning the amount of heat energy reaching the ice surface is substantially lessened. This can act to insulate the glacier from incoming radiation.

===Albedo (radiation reflection)===
The albedo, or the ability of a material to reflect incoming radiation energy, is also an important quality to consider. Generally, the debris will have a lower albedo than the glacier ice it covers, and will thus reflect less incoming solar radiation. Instead, the debris will absorb radiation energy and transfer it through the cover layer to the debris-ice interface.

If the ice is covered by a relatively thin layer of debris (less than around 2 centimeters thick), the albedo effect is most important. As scree accumulates atop the glacier, the ice&#x27;s albedo will begin to decrease. Instead, the glacier ice will absorb incoming solar radiation and transfer it to the upper surface of the ice. Then, the glacier ice begins to absorb the energy and uses it in the process of melting.

However, once the debris cover reaches 2 or more centimeters in thickness, the albedo effect begins to dissipate. Instead, the debris blanket will act to insulate the glacier, preventing incoming radiation from penetrating the scree and reaching the ice surface. In addition to rocky debris, thick snow cover can form an insulating blanket between the cold winter atmosphere and subnivean spaces in screes. As a result, soil, bedrock, and also subterranean voids in screes do not freeze at high elevations.

==Microclimates==
A scree has many small interstitial voids, while an ice cave has a few large hollows. Due to cold air seepage and air circulation, the bottom of scree slopes have a thermal regime similar to ice caves.

Because subsurface ice is separated from the surface by thin, permeable sheets of sediment, screes experience cold air seepage from the bottom of the slope where sediment is thinnest. This freezing circulating air maintains internal scree temperatures 6.8-9.0 °C colder than external scree temperatures. These &lt;0 °C thermal anomalies occur up to 1000m below sites with mean annual air temperatures of 0 °C.

Patchy permafrost, which forms under conditions &lt;0 °C, probably exists at the bottom of some scree slopes despite mean annual air temperatures of 6.8–7.5 °C.

==Biodiversity==
Scree microclimates maintained by circulating freezing air create microhabitats that support taiga plants and animals that could not otherwise survive regional conditions.

A Czech Republic Academy of Sciences research team led by physical chemist Vlastimil Růžička, analyzing 66 scree slopes, published a paper in &quot;Journal of Natural History&quot; in 2012, reporting that: &quot;This microhabitat, as well as interstitial spaces between scree blocks elsewhere on this slope, supports an important assemblage of boreal and arctic bryophytes, pteridophytes, and arthropods that are disjunct from their normal ranges far to the north. This freezing scree slope represents a classic example of a palaeo refugium that significantly contributes to [the] protection and maintenance of regional landscape biodiversity.&quot;

Ice Mountain, a massive scree in West Virginia, supports distinctly different distributions of plant and animal species than northern latitudes.

==Scree running (activity)==
Scree running is the activity of running down a scree slope. This can be very quick, as the scree moves with the runner. Some scree slopes are no longer possible to run, because the stones have been moved towards the bottom.

<text>Edinburgh Napier University () is a public university in Edinburgh, Scotland. Napier Technical College, the predecessor of the university, was founded in 1964, taking its name from 16th-century Scottish mathematician and philosopher John Napier. The technical college was inaugurated as a university in 1992 by Lord Douglas-Hamilton, becoming Napier University. In 2009, the university was renamed Edinburgh Napier University.

The university is based around its three main Edinburgh campuses: Merchiston, Craiglockhart, and Sighthill. It has over 21,000 students, including those on-campus in Scotland and others studying transnational programmes abroad and online. In 2018 this included nearly 9,500 international and EU students, from more than 140 nations worldwide.

Sue Rigby replaced Andrea Nolan as Principal and Vice Chancellor in January 2025.

==History==
&quot;Napier Technical College&quot; was founded in 1964, taking its name from John Napier, who was born in 1550 in the medieval tower house of Merchiston Castle (the site of the university&#x27;s Merchiston campus). His statue stands in the tower of Merchiston Castle today. An opening ceremony was held on 23 February 1965. In 1966, it was renamed &quot;Napier College of Science and Technology&quot;. In 1974, it merged with the Sighthill-based Edinburgh College of Commerce to form &quot;Napier College of Commerce and Technology&quot;, which became a Central Institution in 1985.

The college was renamed &quot;Napier Polytechnic&quot; in 1986 and in the same year acquired the former Hydropathic hospital buildings at Craiglockhart. In June 1992, the institution officially became Napier University. At a ceremony witnessed by over 700 staff and students, Lord James Douglas Hamilton and the then Principal, William Turmeau, unveiled the new university sign at Merchiston. In 1994, Napier University acquired its Craighouse Campus. In 1996, the university gained a new Faculty of Health Studies through a merger between the Scottish Borders College of Nursing and Lothian College of Health Studies. In February 2009, it became Edinburgh Napier University.

Edinburgh Napier has been awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize twice. Its most recent win came in 2015 when it was recognised for its work in timber engineering, sustainable construction, and wood science. Edinburgh Napier was previously awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 2009 when the award was made for &#x27;Innovative housing construction for environmental benefit and quality of life&#x27;. This recognised the contribution made by the university&#x27;s Building Performance Centre towards improving sound insulation between attached dwellings.

The motto of the university, &quot;Nisi sapientia frustra&quot; (meaning &quot;Without knowledge, [all is] in vain&quot;), echoes the motto of the City of Edinburgh Council, &quot;Nisi Dominus frustra&quot; (meaning &quot;Without [the] Lord, [all is] in vain&quot;). Edinburgh Napier&#x27;s Tartan was launched at the same time as the name change in February 2009. Previously, the university used the Clan Napier Tartan; the Chief of Clan Napier welcomed the new university tartan.

==Campuses==
The university is based around its three main campuses at Merchiston, Craiglockhart and Sighthill.

===Sighthill Campus===
The Sighthill Campus opened to students in the School of Health &amp; Social Care and the School of Applied Sciences in January 2011. The campus includes a five-storey learning resource centre, 25 specialised teaching rooms including clinical skills laboratories, three IT-enabled lecture theatres and seminar rooms, a clinical skills suite and integrated sports facilities. The campus has been certified as BREEAM Excellent for best practice in sustainable design.

The Sighthill campus is also home to a new sports facility which includes a biomechanics laboratory and an environmental chamber that can recreate high altitude conditions with controllable temperature and humidity levels to simulate varying climatic conditions. In 2016, the gym facilities at Sighthill became home to the SRU Fosroc Scottish Rugby Academy Edinburgh.

=== Craiglockhart Campus ===
The Craiglockhart Campus is home to The Business School. It incorporates the Craiglockhart Hydropathic Hospital buildings which were for a time known as Craiglockhart War Hospital, where First World War poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon were treated. The Craiglockhart Campus exhibits photography, writing, film and memorabilia to provide a glimpse into the minds of the poets, patients, and medical staff at Craiglockhart. The exhibition also provides a War Poets Collection based on the work of Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen and selected contemporary poets. The exhibition was officially opened on 11 November 2005 by BBC&#x27;s World Affairs Correspondent, Allan Little. This campus is the home of the law and business courses and is also operates as a conference centre. The Craiglockhart Campus was extensively refurbished and extended in 2004 and contains two lecture theatres, language labs, computing facilities and an extensive library.

=== Merchiston Campus ===
The Merchiston Campus is home to the Schools of Art &amp; Creative Industries, and Computing, Engineering &amp; the Built Environment. It is built around the refurbished shell of Merchiston Castle, the family home of John Napier, after whom the university is named. Merchiston Castle is also the ancient seat of Clan Napier. Merchiston Castle is currently a &quot;Category A&quot; listed building in Scotland due to its national significance. The campus also includes the 500-seat, 24-hour Jack Kilby Computing Centre, named after the inventor of integrated circuits and the handheld calculator. Facilities for students include a computer game laboratory, and professional music studios and in 2016, TV presenter and University alumna Lorraine Kelly officially opened a new integrated broadcast journalism newsroom.

Edinburgh Napier Students&#x27; Association (ENSA) is located at the Merchiston Campus.

===Accommodation===
Edinburgh Napier has student accommodation located at three sites across the city: Bainfield in Fountainbridge (opened 2014), Slateford Road (opened 2015) and Orwell Terrace (opened 2016).

The lab is intended to lead to the development of various blockchain applications for use in identity solutions.

== Student life ==
Edinburgh Napier Students&#x27; Association (ENSA) is the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union. The main office is located on Merchiston Campus, with satellite offices on both Craiglockhart and Sighthill campuses. ENSA is represented by three elected student Co-Presidents. The ENSA Union Bar is located above the Three Sisters bar in the Cowgate, Edinburgh.

The Students&#x27; Association is a fully constituted, independent association providing student representation and a free, confidential academic and welfare advice service, as well as supporting a variety of cultural societies and sports clubs. Students can apply for paid employment as a Student Ambassador on a zero-hour contract, as long as the student has at least one year left on their degree.

The student newspaper, &quot;Veritas&quot;, is no longer published. It was founded as a tabloid newspaper in 1993 by Neil McIntosh.

== Midwifery programme ==
In April 2022, a &quot;Skills Workbook&quot;, published by the university&#x27;s midwifery programme and used to educate students, was leaked to the website Reduxx. The workbook dealt with catheterisation, and told students &quot;while most times the pregnant or birthing person will have female genitalia, you may be caring for a person who has transitioned from male to female and may therefore still have external male genitalia&quot;.

In response to the claims made by the university&#x27;s workbook, Elaine Miller, a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, stated &quot;it is not possible for a male person to get pregnant&quot;.
Dr. Susan Bewley, Professor Emeritus in Obstetrics and Women&#x27;s Health at King&#x27;s College London called the materials &quot;puzzling&quot;, and further stated &quot;The writers seem to have left school remarkably ignorant of basic biology, sex, and anatomy&quot;.

The University immediately confirmed the materials had been corrected and stated: &quot;Edinburgh Napier University is committed to upholding the professional standards required of us by the NMC, in particular &#x27;The Code: Professional standards of practice and behaviour for nurses, midwives and nursing associates&#x27; (NMC, 2018), and the &#x27;Standards for pre-registration midwifery programmes&#x27; (NMC, 2019), and wish to be inclusive of all people, including those who identify within the LGBTQ+ communities.&quot;

<text>Vanua Levu (pronounced , , ), formerly known as Sandalwood Island, is the second largest island of Fiji. Located to the north of the larger Viti Levu, the island has an area of and a population of 135,961 .

== Geology ==
Fiji lies in a tectonically complex area between the Australian plate and the Pacific plate. The Fiji Platform lies in a zone bordered with active extension fault lines around which most of the shallow earthquakes were centred. These fault lines are the Fiji Fracture Zone (FFZ) to the north, the 176° Extension Zone (176°E EZ) to the west, and the Hunter fracture zone (HFZ) and Lau Ridge to the east.

Mio-Pliocene sandstones and marl grade into epiclastics and andesitic volcanics of the Suva Group. The Group forms the Korotini Tableland in the middle of the island, it includes the peaks of Seseleka (), Ndelanathau (), Nararo (), Valili (), Mariko (), Mount Nasorolevu (), Ndikeva (), and Uluingala (). The Pliocene Undu Group in the northeastern portion of the island, consists of breccia, tuff, and flows of rhyolite and dacite overlain by pumiceous strata. The Plio-Pleistocene Mba Grouop is found on the southwestern portion of the island and consists of porphyritic basalt flows and volcanoclastics grading into greywacke. The Group includes the peak of Navotuvotu () and the Mt. Kasi Mine.

== Geography ==

The main part of the island is roughly shaped like a tall, thin triangle in width and in length, rotated so that the point is to the northeast. This point, the northernmost in the Fiji chain, is Udu Point. From the southeastern side of this triangle, a long peninsula stretches out into the Koro Sea. The island is rough and hilly, and is surrounded by coral reefs, including Cakaulevu Reef, a long barrier reef off the northern shore. The antimeridian passes through this island, just touching its northeastern tip.

A rugged mountain range divides the island horizontally, forming much of the boundary between the Provinces of Cakaudrove and Macuata. The highest peaks are Mount Batini, also known as Nasorolevu, with an elevation of , and, further north-east, Dikeva, also known as Mount Thurston, with an elevation of . Vanua Levu&#x27;s main mountain ranges lie near the windward, southern coasts, making them much wetter. Northern Vanua Levu, by contrast, has a dry climate eight months of the year, enabling sugar cane, the island&#x27;s major crop, to thrive there. Vanua Levu has a number of rivers, including the Labasa, the Wailevu, and the Qawa. These three form a delta on which the town of Labasa stands. None of the island&#x27;s rivers are navigable by large vessels. There are also many well known rivers on Vanua levu. The first is the most dangerous, the Wainikoro river, known for its shark attacks. The second is the Dreketi river, the deepest river in Fiji.

== Flora and fauna ==
A area covering much of the interior of the Natewa/Tunuloa peninsula is the Natewa/Tunuloa Peninsula Important Bird Area. The Important Bird Area covers the largest tracts of the remaining old-growth forest on the peninsula, which is on the south of Vanua Levu, and supports a population of the vulnerable shy ground doves.

== Demographics and economic activities ==

The island&#x27;s main population centres are the towns of Labasa, in the north, and Savusavu, located at the foot of the peninsula. Labasa, with a population of 28,500 at the 2010 census, has a large Indian community, and is a major centre of Fiji&#x27;s sugar industry. Savusavu is smaller, with a population of just under 5,000, but is a popular centre for tourists owing to its diving and yachting facilities. The main industry on the island is sugar cane production, especially in the north. Copra is also an important crop. Tourism has also emerged as a significant industry on Vanua Levu.

== Politics ==
For administrative purposes, Vanua Levu is divided into three provinces: Bua (in the west), Macuata (in the north-east), and Cakaudrove (in the south-east). These three provinces also comprise the Northern Division of Fiji. Together with the remote Lau Islands, Vanua Levu and its outliers form the Tovata Confederacy, one of three traditional alliances of Fiji&#x27;s chiefs. The Paramount Chief, who is based on the nearby island of Taveuni, holds the title of &quot;Tui Cakau.&quot; Only two population centres – Labasa and Savusavu – have been incorporated as Towns. Each is governed by a mayor and a Town Council, whose members are elected for a three-year term and choose the Mayor from among themselves. At present, normative local body governance is in abeyance, and all cities and towns in Fiji are being run temporarily by Special Administrators appointed by the central government.

== History ==
Vanua Levu was settled about 3,100 years ago, with the settlers living in houses raised above the reefs on the shores. Between 1250 and 1350, the Pacific sea level fell , exposing the tops of the reefs. This killed the abundant sea food, it also dropped the ground water table below the depth of the roots of the crops. The scarcity of food caused conflict and war. In response, the people moved from seaside villages, for mountaintop fortified villages. These forts were occupied until about 1870, with the last clear indication of warfare about 1860.

The Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first known European to sight Vanua Levu, in 1643. He was followed by Captain William Bligh in 1789, en route to Timor while escaping from the Mutiny on the Bounty, in which his crew had forced him and those loyal to him off deck and cast them adrift in a launch. Captain James Wilson subsequently explored the area in 1797 in his ship &quot;Duff&quot;.

Traders began exploiting sandalwood thickets in the Bua Bay area around 1805, which had been discovered by shipwrecked sailors of the schooner &quot;Argo&quot;. By 1815, however, the supply had been depleted and apart from the occasional visit from whalers and bêche-de-mer traders, the island received little further attention until 1840, when a young sailor known as Jackson deserted his crew at Somosomo, on the nearby island of Taveuni, was adopted by a local Chief, and explored much of eastern and northern Vanua Levu.

Settlers from Australia and New Zealand established coconut plantations in the Savusavu area in the 1860s. Intermarriage with Fijian people produced a mixed-race elite, which also prospered from the sale of copra, of which Savusavu was a major centre, until the Great Depression of the 1930s led to a collapse in the price of copra. In the same period, Indians founded the town of Labasa, now a major sugar-producing centre.

In March 2012, the country of Kiribati began negotiating to buy of the island to house its population, which is expected to need to move as their territory is inundated by rising sea levels.

On December 19, 2020, Cyclone Yasa slammed into the island, killing at least four people and causing millions of dollars in damage. 24,000 people were evacuated from their homes.

<text>The 35th Canadian Parliament was in session from January 17, 1994, until April 27, 1997. The membership was set by the 1993 federal election on October 25, 1993, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1997 election.

It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and the 26th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot;, led first by Lucien Bouchard, then by Michel Gauthier, and finally by Gilles Duceppe.

The Speaker was Gilbert Parent. See also list of Canadian electoral districts 1987–96 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

<text>Top Thrill 2 is a launched roller coaster located at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. The ride originally opened as Top Thrill Dragster in 2003, becoming the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, as well as the first ever strata coaster. Designed by Werner Stengel, the Intamin accelerator coaster debuted with a height of , and could accelerate from 0 to in 3.8 seconds. It was themed to Top Fuel drag racing, with the launch track designed to resemble a dragstrip. The ride consistently ranked as one of the world&#x27;s top steel coasters in &quot;Amusement Today&quot;″s annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Top Thrill Dragster&#x27;s records were surpassed in 2005 by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure, though that ride&#x27;s closure in 2024 allowed Top Thrill 2 to briefly reclaim the height record.

Following a 2021 incident in which a guest was severely injured while standing in line, Top Thrill Dragster was closed indefinitely before being permanently closed in September 2022. Zamperla was hired to perform extensive modifications to the ride; most notably, a spike tower was built opposite from the main tower, and Intamin&#x27;s hydraulic launch system was removed in favor of an LSM swing launch.

The coaster reemerged as Top Thrill 2 on May 4, 2024. The updated ride produces a different riding experience while maintaining the original&#x27;s top speed, sending riders forward and backward through three total launches. The ride&#x27;s duration was also extended from 30 seconds to approximately two minutes. After only a week of operation, an issue with the trains was identified, resulting in the closure of Top Thrill 2 while modifications and further testing are being performed. The park intends to reopen the ride in 2025.

== History ==
=== Development ===
According to Rob Decker, Vice President of Planning and Design, the park began working on a new project shortly after the debut of Millennium Force in 2000. After the 2001 season ended, one of the park&#x27;s Dodgem rides, which was located across from Magnum XL-200&#x27;s entrance, was relocated to Michigan&#x27;s Adventure to clear the way for the new ride. In April 2002, work began on the concrete foundation. The concrete footings were kept hidden behind a fence when the park opened for the 2002 season. In August, an informal announcement from Cedar Point confirmed the park was building a new ride for the 2003 season. Track pieces identified as Intamin were previously spotted near Mean Streak. Vertical construction by Martin &amp; Vleminckx began in the fall season, months before the formal announcement. By October, the roller coaster had reached in height, and the highest peak was topped off in December. To construct the roller coaster, the park used five cranes, two of which were tall. 

At the time, only four such cranes in the United States were tall enough to handle construction of the 420-foot tower section. An official announcement revealing details on the new ride was made the following month on January 9, 2003. Officials for the park stated the goal was to build &quot;the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth&quot;, reaching in height and accelerating up to in 4 seconds. The large investment tied it with Millennium Force as being the most expensive in park history. The structure was built by Intamin&#x27;s subcontractor Stakotra. In March, Cedar Fair registered a trademark for the name &quot;Top Thrill Dragster&quot;.

=== Operation ===
Top Thrill Dragster&#x27;s media day was held on May 1, 2003, and it officially opened to the public three days later. It became the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, overtaking the height record from Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land, built three years earlier, and the speed record from Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland, which opened in late 2001. It lost both records to Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in May 2005. Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two shared a similar design and layout that differed primarily by theme and an additional hill featured on Kingda Ka. Shortly after it opened, a faulty valve on the hydraulic system caused a short-term closure. The ride continued to experience a variety of issues dealing with its hydraulic system and launch cable, which frequently led to downtime early on in its tenure.

During the 2017 season&#x27;s opening weekend, Cedar Point temporarily renamed the ride &quot;Top Thrill Cubster&quot;, referencing a lost wager with Six Flags Great America over the World Series. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, timed boarding passes called &quot;Access Passes&quot; were used temporarily to comply with social distancing guidelines.

=== Closure and modification ===
On August 15, 2021, a guest waiting in line to ride Top Thrill Dragster was struck in the head by a small metal piece that dislodged from a train, resulting in a severe injury that was described as a &quot;serious accident&quot;. The ride remained closed the following two seasons pending an investigation by the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) and a redesign of the roller coaster, described as a &quot;new and reimagined ride experience&quot;.

At the time of its closure, Top Thrill Dragster had accommodated 18 million riders over 19 seasons. An update was released on social media in September 2022 stating, &quot;Top Thrill Dragster, as you know it, is being retired.&quot; Officials provided limited details but confirmed that the roller coaster would reopen as a &quot;new and reimagined ride experience&quot;. A portion of the roller coaster&#x27;s track near the station was dismantled in late 2022. In January 2023, the park released the tagline &quot;A New Formula For Thrills&quot; on social media to describe the planned modifications.

There was speculation that Top Thrill Dragster&#x27;s hydraulic launch system would be replaced. In August 2023, the speculation was confirmed after Cedar Point announced plans to transform Top Thrill Dragster into a triple-launched roller coaster using linear synchronous motors. The modified coaster was to reopen as Top Thrill 2. Zamperla, hired to redesign the ride, reused the existing &quot;top hat&quot; and added an equally-sized vertical spike at the opposite end of the track. While the maximum height and speed remained the same, the track length increased to . The vertical spike topped out during early December 2023, and testing took place during early 2024.
===Brief reopening===
Following the completion of construction and testing, Cedar Point held a soft opening media day event on April 25, 2024. The ride was officially opened on May 4, 2024.

A short time later on May 12, Cedar Point announced that there would be an &quot;extended closure&quot; of Top Thrill 2 while the ride&#x27;s trains were modified. The ride remained closed indefinitely through months of speculation and sporadic testing. On August 23, 2024, the park announced that Top Thrill 2 would not reopen for the remainder of the season, but that work would continue with the goal of reopening the ride in 2025.

== Ride experience ==
=== Layout ===
==== As Top Thrill Dragster ====

After leaving the station, the train entered the launch area. To the left of the launch area was a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; light, similar to those employed at the starting line of a drag strip. A brief message was played to the riders before the launch: &quot;Keep arms down, head back, and hold on.&quot; Once the train was prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect was played and its magnetic braking fins were lowered from the launch track. It then launched, accelerating to a speed of in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the catch car disengaged, and the train began its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees clockwise before climbing over the top hat. Upon descending, the track twisted 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes.

====As Top Thrill 2====
After leaving the station, the train passes through a switch and makes an S-turn to the right to join the launch track. To the left of the launch area is a modified version of the original &quot;Christmas tree&quot; light. As soon as the switch changes positions behind the train, the train is launched forward towards the original top hat at , rolling backward partway up the tower. Reaching the launch track again, the train is launched in reverse at , past the station, and up a vertical spike in reverse, crossing over Iron Dragon in the process. Rolling forward onto the launch track once again, the station roof creates a headchopper effect and the train is accelerated to to crest the top hat. After descending the 270 degree spiral drop, the train hits the brake run, while the switch track is reset to allow another train to launch.

=== Station, theme, and trains ===
==== As Top Thrill Dragster ====

The roller coaster was themed to Top Fuel drag racing, a category of motor racing that involved the world&#x27;s fastest accelerating cars. An actual Top Fuel dragster weighs approximately one ton, while each train on the coaster weighed 15 tons. Originally, the design called for five cars on each train, but when the ride first opened, there were only four. A fifth car was added to each by midseason. 

Each dragster-themed train was also decorated with a spoiler, a set of tires, and an engine at the rear of each train, but these were removed after the fifth car was added to allow an extra row of seats to take their place.

The track was mostly painted red, with the launch and approach to the tower having white stripes alternating with red sections. The supports were white on the launch and brake area and yellow on the tower.

====As Top Thrill 2 ====
As Top Thrill 2, the top fuel theming was dropped in favor of a more general racing theme, similar to that of Formula One. The ride area, as well as the trains, are decorated with a stylized logo of &quot;CP Racing.&quot; The redesigned ride runs three 5-car trains supplied by Zamperla, holding 20 people per train. The trains are of Zamperla&#x27;s Lightning model, which is notable for using a milled aluminum chassis and carbon fiber bodywork. For safety, riders can not bring loose items onto the ride, and metal detectors are installed at the beginning of the queue. 

As part of the refurbishment, the ride was repainted to have white track and dark grey supports, with the highest points on both the spike and top hat towers being accented with red sections alternating with white sections.

=== Rollbacks ===
Occasionally a train will launch without sufficient speed to reach the top of the tower and roll back onto the launch track, hence the term &quot;rollback&quot;. This typically happens in cool, wet, or breezy weather, or when the wind is significantly working against it. As Top Thrill Dragster, the launch track was equipped with retractable magnetic brake fins, which were raised after each launch to slow the train down in case it did not reach the top of the tower. As Top Thrill 2, the LSM Launch fins also function as braking fins to slow the train down.

On very rare occasions, a combination of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind could stall a train on top of the tower. When this happened, a mechanic took the elevator to the top and pushed the train down the hill.

== Characteristics ==

When Top Thrill Dragster debuted, it set four new records and currently hold the top three on this list:

* World&#x27;s tallest complete circuit roller coaster
* World&#x27;s tallest roller coaster
* World&#x27;s tallest roller coaster drop
* World&#x27;s fastest roller coaster

It became the fastest roller coaster in the world with a maximum speed of . It was the fourth roller coaster to exceed , preceded by Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland. Dodonpa held the record previously with a top speed of . Top Thrill Dragster also broke the height record, standing at , which was previously held by Superman: Escape from Krypton at . Kingda Ka opened two years later at Six Flags Great Adventure and broke both of Top Thrill Dragster&#x27;s records, boasting a height of and a top speed of until Kingda Ka closed in November of 2024. The speed record was again broken in 2010 by Formula Rossa at Ferrari World, which reaches a maximum speed of .

In the last operational year of the Top Thrill Dragster in 2021, the roller coaster had the second tallest height, the third fastest speed, and the second-highest drop among steel roller coasters in the world. Top Thrill Dragster was the second hydraulically-launched roller coaster from Intamin following Xcelerator at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, and along with Kingda Ka, it is one of two strata coasters ever built. Its marketing tagline was &quot;Race for the Sky&quot;.

As Top Thrill 2, the ride has been marketed as the &quot;tallest and fastest triple launch strata coaster&quot; by Cedar Point, with Zamperla using the more general &quot;tallest and fastest triple launch coaster&quot; in its marketing material. 

== Incidents ==
On July 14, 2004, four people were struck by flying debris while riding, which reports indicated were small pieces of metal from the ride&#x27;s launch cable. The minor injuries included cuts and abrasions, and the riders were treated on site at the park&#x27;s first aid station.
On August 7, 2016, the launch cable detached during operation, and two riders were evaluated at the park&#x27;s first aid station and later released back into the park. Top Thrill Dragster closed for a thorough inspection and reopened the following day.

=== Major incident in 2021 ===
On August 15, 2021, in what was described as a &quot;serious accident&quot;, a guest waiting in line was struck in the head by a small metal L-shaped bracket, called a flag plate, that dislodged from a train as it was nearing the end of its run. The guest was severely injured and treated at a nearby hospital. Top Thrill Dragster was closed for the remainder of the season.

An investigation by the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) was completed in February 2022 and found that half of the bolts securing the flag plate had dislodged. The report confirmed that the ride underwent regular maintenance, including an inspection the night before the accident, which determined the metal plate to be in &quot;normal, working condition&quot;. ODA did not find evidence that Cedar Point violated state laws or that the park had any reason to believe the ride was in &quot;unsafe condition&quot;. In order to reopen the ride, Cedar Point would be required to perform a list of repairs including the replacement of &quot;different or improper grade&quot; bolts and damaged track sections. Instead of repairing, Cedar Point opted to hire Zamperla to create a new version of the ride, which became in 2024. 

The injured guest was later reported to have suffered a traumatic brain injury, and the family sued Cedar Point in 2023. A settlement with confidential terms was reached on April 13, 2024.

<text>Plas y Brenin, located in Conwy County Borough, Wales, is a National Outdoor Centre owned by Sport England. The centre is situated in Dyffryn Mymbyr, the Mymbyr Valley, in Snowdonia and is less than a quarter of a mile south-west of the centre of Capel Curig on the A4086 road.

==History==
In the late 18th century, Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn, built a road from Bangor through the Nant Ffrancon and Dyffryn Ogwen to Betws-y-Coed, and eventually through to Shrewsbury (in use by 1798). In 1801, Lord Penrhyn built the then named Capel Curig Inn. In 1808 the Mail coach which ran from Holyhead to Shrewsbury began running via Capel Curig. The Mail coach ceased operation in 1848 following the opening of the Chester and Holyhead Railway. The inn wasn&#x27;t built on the road (now the A5), but some distance from it on the present site to facilitate enjoyment of the superb view of Llynnau Mymbyr (the lakes) and the Snowdon horseshoe.

Sometime between 1869 and 1871 the building&#x27;s name was changed again from the Capel Curig Hotel to the Royal Hotel. Since its opening in 1801 the most famous guests over the years have been Queen Victoria, Edward VII, George V, and Edward VIII.

Other well-known people who have visited included Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond on 6 September 1807 (there is a plaque commemorating his visit), Sir Joseph Paxton (1856) (designer of The Crystal Palace), Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (1858), Lord Byron (1813) and Sir Walter Scott (1818). Some distinguished visitors to the hotel etched their names into the windows of the then cocktail bar (now the reception area); these were still in place into the 1970s.

==Latterly==

In 1955 the Royal Hotel was renamed &quot;Plas y Brenin&quot;, which means &quot;The King&#x27;s Mansion&quot; in Welsh, as a memorial to King George VI, whose trust fund had bought the building for use by The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and it became &quot;The Snowdonia National Recreation Centre&quot;. Plas y Brenin was visited by H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh (president of the CCPR) on 1 June 1956.

G.I. Milton was its first Warden/Director. John A Jackson, initially Chief Instructor for two years, became its second Director from 1960 to 1976. This was to be Plas y Brenin&#x27;s formative and hard-fought period and it eventually became the &quot;gold standard&quot; for other such centres around the world.

The earliest outdoor courses such as horse riding, surveying, subaqua and flyfishing were later discontinued. Less well known sports such as archery and even javelin were taught; these sports were located in a cellar underneath what is now the dining room.

A less well-known activity was that of &quot;Farmers&#x27; Night&quot; which was instigated very early on and still continues today. Its function was to foster good relations, not only with local farmers but with people who lived in Capel Curig.

==Present==
Plas y Brenin is now a vibrant outdoor centre and is managed by the Mountain Training Trust (MTT), on behalf of Sport England, and is one of three remaining National Centres owned by the sports council, the others being Lilleshall and Bisham Abbey. It is widely regarded as providing gold standard instruction in all aspects of mountaineering, mountain biking and paddling, as well as in rescue. It also supports a range of organisations to develop new coaching and leadership awards, and works with a broad range of groups to get more people active in the outdoors as part of its national centre role.

MTT is a registered charity, set up by the British Mountaineering Council and the training boards, Mountain Training UK and Mountain Training England, primarily to run the centre. The latter point should be considered as a justification of the original intent of Plas y Brenin that for the first twenty five years of the existence of the centre that the British Mountaineering Council treated the existence of Plas y Brenin with a deal of politically motivated negativity.

Plas y Brenin is uniquely positioned below Llynnau Mymbyr at the foot of Dyffryn Mymbyr, the broad valley leading to the Pen-y-Gwryd hotel and the Snowdon Horseshoe. The centre&#x27;s purpose is to offer the highest quality training courses, playing a key role in developing the people who develop the sector. A broad range of courses are offered under the &#x27;climb, hike, paddle, bike&#x27; banner in addition to holding a range of cpd events for a broad range of groups – from those active in university clubs to those working professionally in the outdoors. Courses are run all year round, not only at Plas y Brenin in Snowdonia but in the north west of Scotland and in the Alps.

On site facilities include: 
* 13m climbing wall and a training wall
* Indoor canoe training pool (6m x 3m)
* Fitness room

There is accommodation with up to 65 beds. There are also conference and function room facilities, a large lecture space, a dining room, bar (with one of the best views in Snowdonia) and stores / shop (which hires equipment to the public).

<doc id="712662" wikidata="Q7426817" url="?curid=712662" title="Saturn V instrument unit">
<text>The Saturn V instrument unit is a ring-shaped structure fitted to the top of the Saturn V rocket&#x27;s third stage (S-IVB) and the Saturn IB&#x27;s second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA &quot;(Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter)&quot; panels that contained the Apollo Lunar Module. The instrument unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the instrument unit are a digital computer, analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers, and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA&#x27;s contractor to manufacture the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).

One of the unused instrument units is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. The plaque for the unit has the following inscription:

The Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the Moon, used inertial guidance, a self-contained system that guided the rocket&#x27;s trajectory. The rocket booster had a guidance system separate from those on the command and lunar modules. It was contained in an instrument unit like this one, a ring located between the rocket&#x27;s third stage and the command and lunar modules. The ring contained the basic guidance system components—a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics—as well as radar, telemetry, and other units.

The instrument unit&#x27;s stable platform was based on an experimental unit for the German V-2 rocket of World War II. The Bendix Corporation produced the platform, while IBM designed and built the unit&#x27;s digital computer.


==Specifications==
*Diameter: 260 inches (6.6 m)
*Height: 36 inches (914 mm)
*Weight at launch: ~4,400 lb (1996 kg)

==Mission history==
There was no instrument unit for Saturn I Block I boosters (SA-1 to SA-4). Guidance and control equipment was carried in canisters on top of the S-I first stage, and included the ST-90 stabilized platform, made by Ford Instrument Company and used in the Jupiter missile.

The IU made its debut with SA-5, the first Saturn I Block II launch. The first version of the IU was in diameter and high, and was both designed and built by MSFC. Guidance, telemetry, tracking and power components were contained in four pressurized, cylindrical containers attached like spokes to a central hub.

MSFC flew version 2 of the IU on SA-8, 9 and 10. Version 2 was the same diameter as version 1, but only high. Instead of pressurized containers, the components were hung on the inside of the cylindrical wall, achieving a reduction in weight.

The last version, number 3, was in diameter and tall. It was designed by MSFC but manufactured by IBM in their factory at Huntsville, and flew on all Saturn IB and Saturn V launches. This is the version that is on display in Washington, Huntsville, Houston, and the Apollo/Saturn V Center.

== Mission profile ==
Saturn Apollo flight profiles varied considerably by mission. All missions began, however, with liftoff under power of the first stage. To more smoothly control engine ignition, thrust buildup and liftoff of the vehicle, restraining arms provided support and hold down at four points around the base of the S-IC stage. A gradual controlled release was accomplished during the first six inches of vertical motion.

After clearing the launch tower, a flight program stored in the launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC) commanded a roll of the vehicle to orient it so that the subsequent pitch maneuver pointed the vehicle in the desired azimuth. The roll and pitch commands were controlled by the stored program, and were not affected by navigation measurements. Until the end of the S-IC burn, guidance commands were functions only of time.

First stage cutoff and stage separation were commanded when the IU received a signal that the tank&#x27;s fuel level had reached a predetermined point. Guidance during the second and third stage burns depended both on time and navigation measurements, in order to achieve the target orbit using the minimum fuel.

Second stage engine cutoff was commanded by the IU at a pre-determined fuel level, and the stage was separated. By this time, the vehicle had reached its approximate orbital altitude, and the third stage burn was just long enough to reach a circular parking orbit.

During crewed Apollo missions, the vehicle coasted in Earth orbit for 2-4 passes as the crew performed checks of systems status and other tasks, and as ground stations tracked the vehicle. During the hour and a half after launch, tracking stations around the world had refined estimates of the vehicle&#x27;s position and velocity, collectively known as its state vector. The latest estimates were relayed to the guidance systems in the IU, and to the Command Module Computer in the spacecraft. When the Moon, Earth, and vehicle were in the optimum geometrical configuration, the third stage was reignited to put the vehicle into a translunar orbit. For Apollo 15, for example, this burn lasted 5 minutes 55 seconds.

After translunar injection came the maneuver called transposition, docking, and extraction. This was under crew control, but the IU held the S-IVB/IU vehicle steady while the Command/Service Module (CSM) first separated from the vehicle, rotated 180 degrees, and returned to dock with the Lunar Module (LM). When the CSM and LM had &quot;hard docked&quot; (connected by a dozen latches), the rearranged spacecraft separated from the S-IVB/IU.

The last function of the IU was to command the very small maneuver necessary to keep the S-IVB/IU out of the way of the spacecraft. On some missions the S-IVB/IU went into high Earth or Solar orbit, while on others it was crashed into the Moon; seismometers were left on the Moon during Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, and the S-IVB/IUs of Apollo 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were directed to crash. These impacts provided impulses that were recorded by the seismometer network to yield information about the geological structure of the Moon.

== Subsystems ==
The IU consists of six subsystems: structure, guidance and control, environmental control, emergency detection, radio communications (for telemetry, tracking, and command), and power.

=== Structure ===
The basic IU structure is a short cylinder, 36 inches high and in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure. The top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich. This type of construction was selected for its high strength to weight ratio, acoustical insulation, and thermal conductivity properties. The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall and the weight of the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the Launch Escape Tower). To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft protective rings, 6 inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels. These were removed in the course of stacking the IU into the Saturn vehicle. The structure was manufactured by North American Rockwell in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Edward A. Beasley was the I.U. Program Manager.

The IU is divided into 24 locations, which are marked on the interior by numbers 1–24 on the aluminum surface just above the blue flange.

=== Guidance and control ===

The Saturn V launch vehicle was guided by navigation, guidance, and control equipment located in the IU. A space stabilized platform (the ST-124-M3 inertial platform at location 21) measured acceleration and attitude. A launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC at location 19) solved guidance equations, and an analog flight control computer (location 16) issued commands to steer the vehicle.

The attitude of the vehicle was defined in terms of three axes:

*The roll axis (X) runs from tail to nose and was vertical at time of launch.
*The pitch axis (Y) is at right angles to the roll axis, and is marked on the exterior of the IU by +Y above the viewport, outside location 21.
*The yaw axis (Z) is at right angles to both the pitch and roll axis, and is marked by +Z outside location 3.

The ST-124-M3 inertial platform contains three gimbals: the outer gimbal (which can rotate 360° about the roll or X axis of the vehicle), the middle gimbal (which can rotate ±45° about the yaw or Z axis of the vehicle), and the inner or inertial gimbal (which can rotate 360° about the pitch or Y axis of the vehicle). The inner gimbal is a platform to which are fixed several components:

*Two vertical alignment pendulums sent signals before launch to ground support equipment, which generated signals to the platform gyro torque generators to level the inner gimbal. The vertical alignment system levelled the platform to an accuracy of ±2.5 arc seconds.
*Two prisms, one fixed and one servo-driven, were used with an external theodolite which sighted through the viewport outside location 21 to set the azimuth of the inner gimbal before launch. The azimuth could be set to an accuracy of ±5 arc seconds.
*Three single-degree-of-freedom gyroscopes have their input axes aligned along an orthogonal inertial coordinate system. Three signal generators, fixed to the output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the torque disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the gimbal pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner gimbal rotationally fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner gimbal remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was rotationally fixed.
*Three integrating accelerometers measured the three components of velocity resulting from vehicle propulsion. The accelerometer measurements were sent through the launch vehicle data adapter (LDVA at location 19) to the LVDC. In the LVDC the accelerometer measurements were combined with the computed gravitational acceleration to obtain velocity and position of the vehicle.

The angular positions of gimbals on their axes were measured by resolvers, which sent their signals to the Launch Vehicle Data Adaptor (LVDA). The LVDA was the input/output device for the LVDC. It performed the necessary processing of signals to make these signals acceptable to the LVDC.

The instantaneous attitude of the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In the first and second stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IVB/IU stage.

=== Environmental control ===
The environmental control system (ECS) maintains an acceptable operating environment for the IU equipment during preflight and flight operations. The ECS is composed of the following:

*The thermal conditioning system (TCS), which maintains a circulating coolant temperature to the electronic equipment of 59° ± 1 °F (15 ± 0.6 °C).
*Preflight purging system, which maintains a supply of temperature- and pressure-regulated mixture of air and gaseous nitrogen (air/GN2) in the IU/S-IVB equipment area.
*Gas bearing supply system, which furnishes GN2 to the ST-124-M3 inertial platform gas bearings.
*Hazardous gas detection sampling equipment which monitors the IU/S-IVB forward interstage area for the presence of hazardous vapors

==== Thermal conditioning ====
Thermal conditioning panels, also called cold plates, were located in both the IU and S-IVB stage (up to sixteen in each stage). Each cold plate contains tapped bolt holes in a grid pattern which provides flexibility of component mounting.

The cooling fluid circulated through the TCS was a mixture of 60 percent methanol and 40 percent demineralized water by weight. Each cold plate was capable of dissipating at least 420 watts.

During flight, heat generated by equipment mounted on the cold plates was dissipated to space by a sublimation heat exchanger. Water from a reservoir (water accumulator) was exposed to the low temperature and pressure environment of space, where it first freezes and then sublimates, taking heat from the heat exchanger and transferring it to the water molecules which escape to space in gaseous state. Water/methanol was cooled by circulation through the heat exchanger.

==== Preflight air/GN2 purge system ====
Before flight, ground support equipment (GSE) supplies cooled, filtered ventilating air to the IU, entering via the large duct in the middle of the umbilical panel (location 7), and branching into two ducts at the top that are carried around the IU in the cable rack. Downward pointing vents from these ducts release ventilating air to the interior of the IU. During fueling, gaseous nitrogen was supplied instead of air, to purge any propellant gases that might otherwise accumulate in the IU.

==== Gas bearing supply ====
To reduce errors in sensing attitude and velocity, designers cut friction to a minimum in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen. The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 L) of gas at 3,000 psig (pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 MPa). This sphere is 21 inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, to the left of the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings in the stable platform.

==== Hazardous gas detection ====
The hazardous gas detection system monitors the presence of hazardous gases in the IU and S-IVB stage forward compartments during vehicle fueling. Gas was sampled at four locations: between panels 1 and 2, 7 and 8, 13 and 14, and 19 and 20. Tubes lead from these locations to location 7, where they were connected to ground support equipment (external to the IU) which can detect hazardous gases.

=== Emergency detection ===

The emergency detection system (EDS) sensed initial development of conditions in the flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations in one of two ways. If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the emergency condition were developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.

The EDS was distributed throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored each of the three axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew could initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.

=== Radio communications ===
The IU communicated by radio continually to ground for several purposes. The measurement and telemetry system communicated data about internal processes and conditions on the Saturn V. The tracking system communicated data used by the Mission Ground Station (MGS) to determine vehicle location. The radio command system allowed the MGS to send commands up to the IU.

==== Measuring and telemetry ====
Approximately 200 parameters were measured on the IU and transmitted to the ground, in order to

*Assist in the checkout of the launch vehicle prior to launch,
*Determine vehicle condition and to verify received commands during flight, and
*Facilitate postflight analysis of the mission.

Parameters measured include acceleration, angular velocity, flow rate, position, pressure, temperature, voltage, current, frequency, and others. Sensor signals were conditioned by amplifiers or converters located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each. Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In order for the two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and time sharing multiplexing techniques were used to accomplish this. The two modulation techniques used were pulse-code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).

Two Model 270 time sharing multiplexers (MUX-270) were used in the IU telemetry system, mounted at locations 9 and 10. Each one operates as a 30×120 multiplexer (30 primary channels, each sampled 120 times per second) with provisions for submultiplexing individual primary channels to form 10 subchannels each sampled at 12 times per second. Outputs from the MUX-270 go to the PCM/DDAS assembly model 301 at location 12, which in turn drives the 245.3 MHz PCM VHF transmitter.

The FM/FM signals were carried in 28 subcarrier channels and transmitted by a 250.7 MHz FM transmitter.

Both the FM/FM and the PCM/FM channels were coupled to the two telemetry antennas on opposite sides of the IU outside locations 10 and 22.

==== Tracking ====
C-band radar transponders carried by the IU provided tracking data to the ground which were used to determine the vehicle&#x27;s trajectory. The transponder received coded or single pulse interrogation from ground stations and transmitted a single-pulse reply in the same frequency band (5.4 to 5.9 GHz). A common antenna was used for receiving and transmitting. The C-band transponder antennas are outside locations 11 and 23, immediately below CCS PCM omni receive antennas.

==== Radio command ====
The command communications system (CCS) provided for digital data transmission from ground stations to the LVDC. This communications link was used to update guidance information or command certain other functions through the LVDC. Command data originated in the Mission Control Center, Houston, and was sent to remote stations for transmission to the launch vehicle. Command messages were transmitted from the ground at 2101.8 MHz. The received message was passed to the command decoder (location 18), where it was checked for authenticity before being passed to the LVDC. Verification of message receipt was accomplished through the IU PCM telemetry system. The CCS system used five antennas:

*A single directional antenna outside location 3–4,
*Two omni transmit antennas outside locations 11 and 23, and
*Two omni receive antennas outside locations 12 and 24.

=== Power ===
Power during flight originated with four silver-zinc batteries with a nominal voltage of 28±2 vdc. Battery D10 sat on a shelf at location 5, batteries D30 and D40 were on shelves in location 4, and battery D20 was at location 24. Two power supplies converted the unregulated battery power to regulated 56 vdc and 5 vdc. The 56 vdc power supply was at location 1 and provided power to the ST-124-M3 platform electronic assembly and the accelerometer signal conditioner. The 5 vdc power supply at location 12 provided 5 ±.005 vdc to the IU measuring system.

These images show the development of the IU. The first four Saturn launches did not have an IU, but used guidance, telemetry and other equipment installed on top of the first stage.

The first IU flew on the fifth Saturn launch, SA-5, and was in diameter and high. The components it carried were in pressurized containers. This version flew on SA-5, SA-6 and SA-7. The IU carried by missions SA-8, -9, and -10 was only high, and was not pressurized.

With the Saturn IB and Saturn V launches, a third version was used, in diameter and high. Comparison of these photographs of the instrument unit shows that the configuration of components carried by this version changed, depending on the mission. Some equipment was deleted (e.g., the Azusa tracking system was deleted from later IUs), some equipment was added (e.g., a fourth battery for longer missions), and other components were moved around.

These images also show that some components (e.g., batteries, the ST-124 inertial platform) were installed in the IU after it had been stacked in the VAB on top of the S-IVB third stage.

<doc id="712664" wikidata="Q743320" url="?curid=712664" title="List of The X-Files episodes">
<text>&quot;The X-Files&quot; is an American science fiction–supernatural television series that originally aired on the Fox network for 9 seasons from September 10, 1993, to May 19, 2002. The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder, an FBI profiler, is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully, a medical doctor, is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder&#x27;s discoveries which could ultimately be used to discredit his work. Throughout the series the two develop a close friendship. During the eighth and ninth seasons of the series, Duchovny&#x27;s role was reduced from lead actor to an intermittent lead role.

The show&#x27;s premise originated with Chris Carter, who served as an executive producer along with R. W. Goodwin, Frank Spotnitz, Howard Gordon, Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, Kim Manners, Glen Morgan, James Wong, and many others. Filming for seasons one to five took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia, and for the remaining seasons in Los Angeles.

Episodes were broadcast on Fridays at 9:00 pm Eastern Time for the series&#x27; first three seasons; the remaining six seasons aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm Eastern Time. Episodes are approximately 45 minutes in length (not including commercials) and were broadcast in standard definition. Two feature films based on the television series have been released as part of &quot;The X-Files&quot; franchise: the first premiered in summer 1998, between seasons five and six of the series, and a post-series film, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, was released in 2008. On March 24, 2015, Fox officially announced the series would return for a six-episode tenth season, which aired in 2016. On April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced &quot;The X-Files&quot; would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which premiered on January 3, 2018. 

Many mythology collections of &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes have been released on DVD. Since 2000, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has distributed all seasons on DVD, and episodes are also available for download at the iTunes Store and Amazon Video, and are available for streaming on Hulu. The show&#x27;s episodes have won a number of awards, including three Golden Globe Awards for Best Drama Series and a Satellite Award for Best Drama Series. Various cast members&#x27; performances have been praised by critics, particularly those of Duchovny and Anderson.

<text>Shemar Franklin Moore (born April 20, 1970) is an American actor. His notable roles include Malcolm Winters on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1994–2002, 2004–2005, 2014, 2019, 2023), Derek Morgan on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2005–2016), and the lead role of Sergeant II Daniel &quot;Hondo&quot; Harrelson on &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (2017–present) all on CBS. Moore was also the third permanent host of &quot;Soul Train&quot; from 1999 to 2003. Moore is also known for playing G.U.N. Agent Randall Handel in the second and third films of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film series.

Moore has won eight NAACP Image Awards as well as the 2000 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. He was nominated for a People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2016 for his work on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Oakland, California, the son of Marilyn Wilson, a teacher, and Sherrod Moore. Moore&#x27;s father was African-American and his mother, who was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, was of Irish and French-Canadian descent. His mother, who had a degree in mathematics, worked as a teacher in Bahrain and Denmark. Moore moved with her to Denmark as an infant, and then to Bahrain when he was four, where he attended a British private school until the age of seven. His grandmother is from Quebec City, Canada. Moore cites civil unrest, interracial relationships being taboo, and racism in the U.S. in the 1970s as part of the reason his mother moved abroad with him. Returning to the U.S. in 1977, the family moved to Chico, California, where his mother worked at a clinic, before later moving to Palo Alto. A gifted and talented child, Moore attended The Nueva School in Hillsborough, California before graduating from Gunn High School in Palo Alto. Moore was awarded an athletic scholarship to attend Santa Clara University where he played varsity baseball as both a pitcher and an outfielder all four years. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications with a minor in Theater Arts.

==Career==
Moore is best known for his role as Malcolm Winters on the CBS television soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; for more than a decade. In November 2004, he returned to &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; after originally planning to leave the show, but after a few months he dropped back to recurring status and left in September 2005. In 2007, he said, &quot;My time is done on &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;. I did eight solid years as Malcolm.&quot;

During his time on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, Moore was the host of the syndicated version of the series &quot;Soul Train&quot; from 1999 until 2003, and he appeared in the 2001 feature film &quot;The Brothers&quot;. He portrayed Detective Jesse Reese on the television series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; from 2002 to 2003. Moore played Emery Simms in the 2004 film &quot;Motives&quot; alongside Vivica Fox and Golden Brooks, and had a supporting role in the film &quot;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&quot;. He also appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;The Seat Filler&quot; with Kelly Rowland and Duane Martin.

In 2005, Moore began playing Derek Morgan in the original cast of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. In March 2016, he left the role, after 251 episodes, in episode 18 of season 11, &quot;A Beautiful Disaster&quot;.

In February 2017, it was announced that Moore would star in CBS&#x27;s new series titled &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, based on the 2003 film and 1975 television series of the same name. The show has now filmed eight seasons.

In June 2021, it was announced that Moore had joined the cast of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, as Randall Handel. He also stars as the &quot;Unnecessary Action Hero&quot; in a series of commercials for Paycom.

Moore worked as a model during his college years. He is signed to DNA Model Management in New York City. Moore appeared on the March 2009 issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; magazine.

==Personal life==
Moore dated soccer player Shawna Gordon from 2014 to 2016. In 2018, he dated &quot;Quantico&quot; actress Anabelle Acosta. On January 9, 2023, he announced the due date of his first child with his girlfriend, Jesiree Dizon. The couple&#x27;s daughter was born January 24, 2023. In January 2025, it was reported Dizon and Moore were no longer involved.

Moore formed a retail clothing company known as Baby Girl LLC. The company&#x27;s profits are used to help fight multiple sclerosis, a disease Moore&#x27;s mother had. The organization&#x27;s name is derived from a phrase used by Moore&#x27;s character, Derek Morgan, on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. In 2016, actor Keith Tisdell pleaded guilty to grand theft charges after stealing more than $60,000 from Baby Girl LLC, and agreed to repay the amount.

<doc id="712675" wikidata="Q1198874" url="?curid=712675" title="Operator theory">
<text>In mathematics, operator theory is the study of linear operators on function spaces, beginning with differential operators and integral operators. The operators may be presented abstractly by their characteristics, such as bounded linear operators or closed operators, and consideration may be given to nonlinear operators. The study, which depends heavily on the topology of function spaces, is a branch of functional analysis.

If a collection of operators forms an algebra over a field, then it is an operator algebra. The description of operator algebras is part of operator theory.

==Single operator theory==
Single operator theory deals with the properties and classification of operators, considered one at a time. For example, the classification of normal operators in terms of their spectra falls into this category.

===Spectrum of operators===
The spectral theorem is any of a number of results about linear operators or about matrices. In broad terms the spectral theorem provides conditions under which an operator or a matrix can be diagonalized (that is, represented as a diagonal matrix in some basis). This concept of diagonalization is relatively straightforward for operators on finite-dimensional spaces, but requires some modification for operators on infinite-dimensional spaces. In general, the spectral theorem identifies a class of linear operators that can be modelled by multiplication operators, which are as simple as one can hope to find. In more abstract language, the spectral theorem is a statement about commutative C*-algebras. See also spectral theory for a historical perspective.

Examples of operators to which the spectral theorem applies are self-adjoint operators or more generally normal operators on Hilbert spaces.

The spectral theorem also provides a canonical decomposition, called the spectral decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition, or eigendecomposition, of the underlying vector space on which the operator acts.

====Normal operators====
A normal operator on a complex Hilbert space formula_1 is a continuous linear operator formula_2 that commutes with its hermitian adjoint formula_3, that is: formula_4.

Normal operators are important because the spectral theorem holds for them. Today, the class of normal operators is well understood. Examples of normal operators are
* unitary operators: formula_5
* Hermitian operators (i.e., selfadjoint operators): formula_6; (also, anti-selfadjoint operators: formula_7)
* positive operators: formula_8, where formula_9 is any operator
* normal matrices can be seen as normal operators if one takes the Hilbert space to be formula_10.

The spectral theorem extends to a more general class of matrices. Let formula_11 be an operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. formula_11 is said to be normal if formula_13. One can show that formula_11 is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable: By the Schur decomposition, we have formula_15, where formula_16 is unitary and formula_17 upper triangular. Since formula_11 is normal, formula_19. Therefore, formula_17 must be diagonal since normal upper triangular matrices are diagonal. The converse is obvious.

In other words, formula_11 is normal if and only if there exists a unitary matrix formula_16 such that
formula_23
where formula_24 is a diagonal matrix. Then, the entries of the diagonal of formula_24 are the eigenvalues of formula_11. The column vectors of formula_16 are the eigenvectors of formula_11 and they are orthonormal. Unlike the Hermitian case, the entries of formula_24 need not be real.

===Polar decomposition===
The polar decomposition of any bounded linear operator &quot;A&quot; between complex Hilbert spaces is a canonical factorization as the product of a partial isometry and a non-negative operator.

The polar decomposition for matrices generalizes as follows: if &quot;A&quot; is a bounded linear operator then there is a unique factorization of &quot;A&quot; as a product &quot;A&quot; = &quot;UP&quot; where &quot;U&quot; is a partial isometry, &quot;P&quot; is a non-negative self-adjoint operator and the initial space of &quot;U&quot; is the closure of the range of &quot;P&quot;.

The operator &quot;U&quot; must be weakened to a partial isometry, rather than unitary, because of the following issues. If &quot;A&quot; is the one-sided shift on &quot;l&quot;(N), then |&quot;A&quot;| = (&quot;A*A&quot;)1/2 = &quot;I&quot;. So if &quot;A&quot; = &quot;U&quot; |&quot;A&quot;|, &quot;U&quot; must be &quot;A&quot;, which is not unitary.

The existence of a polar decomposition is a consequence of Douglas&#x27; lemma:
The operator &quot;C&quot; can be defined by , extended by continuity to the closure of &quot;Ran&quot;(&quot;B&quot;), and by zero on the orthogonal complement of . The operator &quot;C&quot; is well-defined since implies . The lemma then follows.

In particular, if , then &quot;C&quot; is a partial isometry, which is unique if 
In general, for any bounded operator &quot;A&quot;,
formula_30
where (&quot;A*A&quot;)1/2 is the unique positive square root of &quot;A*A&quot; given by the usual functional calculus. So by the lemma, we have
formula_31
for some partial isometry &quot;U&quot;, which is unique if Ker(&quot;A&quot;) ⊂ Ker(&quot;U&quot;). (Note , where .) Take &quot;P&quot; to be (&quot;A*A&quot;)1/2 and one obtains the polar decomposition &quot;A&quot; = &quot;UP&quot;. Notice that an analogous argument can be used to show &quot;A = P&#x27;U&#x27; &quot;, where &quot;P&#x27; &quot; is positive and &quot;U&#x27; &quot; a partial isometry.

When &quot;H&quot; is finite dimensional, &quot;U&quot; can be extended to a unitary operator; this is not true in general (see example above). Alternatively, the polar decomposition can be shown using the operator version of singular value decomposition.

By property of the continuous functional calculus, |&quot;A&quot;| is in the C*-algebra generated by &quot;A&quot;. A similar but weaker statement holds for the partial isometry: the polar part &quot;U&quot; is in the von Neumann algebra generated by &quot;A&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; is invertible, &quot;U&quot; will be in the C*-algebra generated by &quot;A&quot; as well.

===Connection with complex analysis===
Many operators that are studied are operators on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions, and the study
of the operator is intimately linked to questions in function theory.
For example, Beurling&#x27;s theorem describes the invariant subspaces of the unilateral shift in terms of inner functions, which are bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk with unimodular boundary values almost everywhere on the circle. Beurling interpreted the unilateral shift as multiplication by the independent variable on the Hardy space. The success in studying multiplication operators, and more generally Toeplitz operators (which are multiplication, followed by projection onto the Hardy space) has inspired the study of similar questions on other spaces, such as the Bergman space.

==Operator algebras==
The theory of operator algebras brings algebras of operators such as C*-algebras to the fore.

===C*-algebras===

A C*-algebra, &quot;A&quot;, is a Banach algebra over the field of complex numbers, together with a map . One writes &quot;x*&quot; for the image of an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;A&quot;. The map * has the following properties:

* It is an involution, for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot; formula_32
* For all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;A&quot;: formula_33 formula_34
* For every λ in C and every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;: formula_35
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;: formula_36

Remark. The first three identities say that &quot;A&quot; is a *-algebra. The last identity is called the C* identity and is equivalent to:
formula_37

The C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the spectral radius formula, it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:
formula_38

<text>Fabulous Muscles is the third studio album by American experimental band Xiu Xiu, released on February 17, 2004 on 5 Rue Christine. The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, described as a depressive mix between experimental rock and synth-pop. It is considered to be more accessible than Xiu Xiu&#x27;s previous two studio albums, &quot;A Promise&quot; and &quot;Knife Play&quot;. &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; has received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Overview==
&quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; was Xiu Xiu&#x27;s third album in two years. The album was recorded in Oakland and Seattle and was produced by band member Cory McCulloch. The album&#x27;s cover features band leader Jamie Stewart nuzzling a toy kitten.

Several reviewers found &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; to have a more accessible sound than Xiu Xiu&#x27;s previous albums. On recording the album, Stewart said:
Stewart contributed the title track to a tribute CD, &quot;The Ash Gray Proclamation&quot;, for author Dennis Cooper. They said that they would not have been able to write a song like that without having read Cooper&#x27;s books, since Cooper helped Stewart &quot;to feel ... that it was possible to be more open&quot; due to his &quot;frankness&quot;.

==Themes and lyrics==

&quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; is populated by dark themes, including depression, physical abuse, mental abuse, and drug addiction.

Jamie Stewart told &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that the tone of the album reflected the events of their personal life, which were &quot;incredibly, incredibly violent, incredibly jarring and difficult to take... and personally and politically extreme in black and white ways&quot;. Their next studio album, &quot;The Air Force&quot;, reflects their experience internalizing the trauma of that period.

The album&#x27;s title track was inspired by the Iceberg Slim novel &quot;Mama Black Widow&quot; and describes an abusive relationship between a muscle-worshiping Stewart and a hyper-masculine man. The song &quot;Brian the Vampire&quot; is based on a child Stewart encountered during their time as a preschool teacher in California. According to Stewart, &quot;His whole family lived in one garage and his older brother ... was molesting Brian at night while the whole family was sleeping in the room.&quot; The penultimate &quot;Clowne Towne&quot; sees Stewart reflect on the current statuses of friends from their teens and young adulthood (such as Michael Hadreas of Perfume Genius or fellow Xiu Xiu member Caralee McElroy) and how they compare to their own. &quot;Mike&quot; is a tribute to Stewart&#x27;s late father Michael Stewart, who committed suicide in 2002, while &quot;Support Our Troops OH! (Black Angels OH!)&quot; is about Stewart&#x27;s distaste about soldiers serving in the Iraq War.

==Reception==

&quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; received mostly positive reviews. On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album has a score of 80 out of 100, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;. Critics were generally receptive to the album&#x27;s more accessible sound.

Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; &quot;might be the best expression of Xiu Xiu&#x27;s unrepentantly original music; even if the world that the band creates isn&#x27;t necessarily one you&#x27;d want to visit all the time, it remains fascinating.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Matt LeMay also praised the album, writing, &quot;Though there are many notable high points to &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot;, its overwhelming consistency is what cements its place as Xiu Xiu&#x27;s finest. The album does not contain a single hiccup or yawn-- no extraneous noise, no potentially offputting histrionics, no throwaways and no dull moments.&quot; The album also received a &quot;Best New Music&quot; designation in the review. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised it as &quot;more focused and direct&quot; than &quot;A Promise&quot;.

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; panned the album, writing, &quot;The musical parsimony, cultural insularity, moral certitude, and histrionic affectations of these lo-fi artier-than-thous promise indie ideologues whole lifetimes of egoistic irrelevance.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Akiva Gottlieb wrote, &quot;Obviously, Stewart has a penchant for self-examination—some of it brilliant and incisive—but [their] work is also obnoxiously self-indulgent.&quot;

&quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; has appeared on a few end of year lists. &quot;The Morning News&quot; named it the 7th best album of 2004. Pitchfork Media ranked &quot;Fabulous Muscles&quot; #50 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2004. In addition, the same website ranked the song &quot;I Luv the Valley OH!&quot; #176 on their list of the Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s, with reviewer Brian Howe writing &quot;A great Xiu Xiu song is like someone actually hurting himself, right in front of you. This [&quot;I Luv the Valley OH!&quot;] isn&#x27;t their most violent effort, but it&#x27;s their most scouring; a place where mortar-round drums pound down on rolling bass and chiming guitars, unsubtly conveying the painful insight that some dreams have to be razed, not realized.&quot; The album also placed 19th on Tiny Mix Tapes favorite albums of 2000-2009.

Brandon Stosuy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album as &quot;brilliant&quot; and a blend of &quot;circus music and shattered death disco&quot;. In a review of Xiu Xiu&#x27;s recent album &quot;Oh No&quot;, Brian Howe of Pitchfork described the title track as a &quot;mini-masterpiece.&quot;

<text>Turun Palloseura, commonly known as TPS, is a professional football club based in Turku, Finland. Since 2024, the men&#x27;s team competes in Ykkösliiga, the second highest tier. The women&#x27;s representative team in the Kansallinen Liiga, the highest level of women&#x27;s football in Finland. Nicknamed &quot;Tepsi&quot;, the club was founded in 1922.

TPS have won 8 League titles and 3 Finnish Cups. They play their home league matches at Veritas Stadion, with a capacity of 9,372 seats for most matches.

==History==

In the early stages of the UEFA Cup of the season 1987–88, TPS beat Internazionale at the San Siro stadium in Milan, thanks to a goal by Mika Aaltonen, who was later signed by Inter. They lost the return leg with 0–2, but this is widely regarded as the highest point by the club in international football.

After season 2000, TPS lost its place in Finland&#x27;s Premier League and played for two seasons in the Ykkönen (eng first) in the Finnish first division. In 2001, Petri Jakonen was named a new sporting director of TPS. They aimed to get back up to the Premier League with determination and it took them two seasons to complete the mission. Since season 2003 TPS has again played in the Finland&#x27;s Premier League, Veikkausliiga. TPS managed to get in the final of the Finnish Cup in 2005, but lost to Haka 4–1 at Finnair Stadium.

Before season 2007, TPS hired famous Finnish striker Mixu Paatelainen as their manager. In his guidance TPS won bronze, ending their ten-year medalless run. After the end of season Paatelainen left for Scottish club Hibernian FC in early January 2008. Quickly TPS hired heralded Finnish manager Martti Kuusela. However Kuusela didn&#x27;t get the best out of his squad and was fired mid September 2008. Overall TPS ended sixth in Veikkausliiga. So again, TPS had to get a new manager, their third in as many seasons. This time they picked Pasi Rautiainen. The CEO also changed next year as Jakonen moved on to Finnish FA and a former sporting director Marco Casagrande was named the new CEO.

In recent years, TPS has had the highest average attendance in Veikkausliiga but it has suffered from a poor rental agreement with Veritas Stadion. This has led TPS for planning to build their own stadium in Nummi. They also considered the possibility of using the Paavo Nurmi Stadion as their home ground, but these plans faced scheduling problems with Athletics competitions and were scrapped. Both Turku based teams however played few games at the Paavo Nurmi Stadion during 2014 season when the Veritas Stadion was under maintenance. After relegation TPS changed their home venue to the Urheilupuiston yläkenttä, which is close to the Paavo Nurmi Stadion in the Turku Sports Park, but is not eligible to be used in the Veikkausliiga. Future plans for home ground development have not been made public.

TPS returned to the Veikkausliiga for the 2018 season, winning the Ykkönen title on 21 October 2017 with a 1–1 draw against Honka. However, after the 2018 season, TPS was again relegated to Ykkönen, after finishing second-to-last in the league and losing the two-leg play-off against Kokkolan Pallo-Veikot (KPV), the Ykkönen runner-up. Since the 2018 season, TPS plays all home games at Veritas Stadion.

During 2020–2022, the club&#x27;s former manager Mika Laurikainen worked as a sporting director. He named himself the first team&#x27;s head coach for the 2023 Ykkönen season.

The club&#x27;s former homegrown player Lukas Hradecky had been a minority shareholder of the club. In mid-August 2024, it was announced that Hradecky had increased his share and is currently one of the club&#x27;s majority owners. In late August, the club&#x27;s former player Kasper Hämäläinen was named the new sporting director.

Due to economic troubles, head coach Miika Nuutinen left the club in January 2025 after serving one season in the position. Subsequently a Spanish coach Ivan Piñol was named the new manager for the 2025 Ykkösliiga season.

<doc id="712682" wikidata="Q689415" url="?curid=712682" title="L'Âme Immortelle">
<text>L&#x27;Âme Immortelle (French for &quot;the immortal soul&quot;) is an Austrian darkwave duo formed in 1996. Many of L&#x27;Âme Immortelle&#x27;s songs feature melancholy or lovelorn lyrics in German or English, and juxtaposed harsh male and emotional female vocals. In 2004 they switched label to the now defunct Supersonic Records (a subsidiary of Sony BMG) and their work moved away from the band&#x27;s electronic roots to the heavier Neue Deutsche Härte (&quot;New German hardness&quot;) genre. In 2008 they went back to their former label Trisol and they returned to their musical roots.

== History ==
===Founding===
L&#x27;Âme Immortelle was formed in 1996 in Austria by friends Thomas Rainer and Hannes Medwenitsch. Soon vocalist Sonja Kraushofer, a former classmate of Rainer, joined and the band sought a record contract. They released their first album, &quot;Lieder die wie Wunden bluten&quot;, in 1997 on MOS Records in Liechtenstein, which became popular in the underground German dark culture.

===Trisol Records===
In 1999, L&#x27;Âme Immortelle switched to Trisol Records (part of Trisol Music Group GmbH). From 1998 through 2001, L&#x27;Âme Immortelle released another LP yearly, each bringing the band greater popularity. In 2002, Medwenitsch left the band Kraushofer and Rainer recruited Ashley Dayour (from the Austrian band Whispers in the Shadow) as a guitarist and the re-formed L&#x27;Âme Immortelle released a new single, &quot;Tiefster Winter&quot; in November 2002. In 2003, L&#x27;Âme Immortelle released &quot;Als die Liebe starb&quot;, as well as &quot;Seelensturm&quot;, a collection of re-issued and re-mixed early material.

===Supersonic Records===
In 2004, the band switched labels again, this time to major label Supersonic, a subsidiary of Sony BMG Music Entertainment. 
The first issue following the switch was a collaboration with Oomph! on the initially non-album (it was later inlided on a re-edition of the album &quot;Wahrheit oder Pflicht&quot;) single &quot;Brennende Liebe&quot; (released as Oomph! feat. L&#x27;Âme Immortelle); they also appeared in the video. Following that, L&#x27;Âme Immortelle released a new album, &quot;Gezeiten&quot;, which includes some of their most popular songs like &quot;5 Jahre&quot;, &quot;Stumme Schreie&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. A significant change in L&#x27;Âme Immortelle&#x27;s style is evident now that the band is on a major label, notably the electronic instrumentation of earlier work was less prominent in &quot;Gezeiten&quot;.

Their eighth album &quot;Auf deinen Schwingen&quot; was released in August 2006 along with the single &quot;Phönix&quot;. The record also includes songs like &quot;Wohin&quot; which contains text from another famous LAI song &quot;Aus den Ruinen&quot;, and &quot;Nur Du&quot;—a song which totally differs from older L&#x27;Âme Immortelle works. The music video for this song is a cartoon, an unusual thing for the band.

Out since 22 June on Gun Supersonic is LAI&#x27;s 10 year retrospective best-of album &quot;10 Jahre&quot;. &quot;10 Jahre&quot; presents the highlights of their career with hit tracks and fan favourites taken from each of their albums. This release also includes two brand new exclusive tracks,&quot;Let Me Fall&quot; and &quot;Come Closer&quot;.

===Return to Trisol===
In December 2007, Trisol Records announced that L&#x27;Âme Immortelle had returned to the Trisol label to release a new album, &quot;Namenlos&quot;. Released 1 January 2008, &quot;Namenlos&quot; is a two-CD double-album. Trisol&#x27;s press release denied that the band&#x27;s label switch was motivated by poor performance of its last Supersonic album &quot;Auf deinen Schwingen&quot;, but hinted that the band was returning to its pre-Supersonic style.

On 18 November 2011, the band announced 27 January 2012 as the release date for their tenth studio album &quot;Momente&quot;. On 27 April 2012, a new album, &quot;Fragmente&quot;, featuring remixed versions of 10 songs from &quot;Momente&quot; (five by Rainer, five by Kraushofer) was released 

== Solo projects ==
In 2000, Thomas Rainer released the first album, &quot;Gesellschaft:Mord&quot;, for his side project with Joachim Sobczak, Siechtum. The following two albums were &quot;Diagnose:Zeit&quot; and &quot;Kreuz:X:Feuer&quot;, which featured remixes by God Module and Megadump.

In 2007, Thomas Rainer released his debut album under the Nachtmahr moniker. The first release for this electro/industrial project was titled &quot;Kunst ist Krieg&quot;. In 2008, the second album, titled &quot;Feuer frei!&quot;, was released.

Persephone, a.k.a. Sonja Kraushofer, returns with a fourth album. After the Trisol release &quot;Home&quot; (2002), &quot;Atma Gyan&quot; (2004) and &quot;Mera Sangeet Kho Gaya&quot; (2004), &quot;Letters to a Stranger&quot; is to be released on the Curzweyhl label.

Ashley Dayour, the long term guitarist of the band, released several records with his other band, Whispers in the Shadow. The last one was &quot;Yesterday Is Forever&quot; in 2020.

<doc id="712684" wikidata="Q2354133" url="?curid=712684" title="M-99 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-99 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It runs from the Ohio state border, where it connects to State Route 15 (SR 15), north to Lansing, where it terminates at a junction with Interstate 496 (I-496). The highway mainly serves local communities along the route as it passes through farm lands in the southern part of the state. One short segment, in Jonesville, is routed concurrently with US Highway 12 (US 12). The segment within Lansing follows Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

The current highway is the third to carry the M-99 designation. The others were located near Lake Michigan near Muskegon in the Lower Peninsula and Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula in the 1920s and 1930s. The current highway was first designated as parts of M-34 and M-64 in 1919. These numbers were later dropped in favor of an M-9 designation in 1929. For part of 1934, a loop route was designated M-158 in Hillsdale County that was used for a rerouted M-9 in the area. The M-99 designation was applied to the highway in 1940. Since then, the state has completed paving twice; one segment was returned to gravel surface for two years in the 1950s. The southern section in Hillsdale County was rerouted in the 1960s, and sections were converted into divided highways in the late 1970s.

==Route description==
SR 15 ends at the Michigan state line just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly agricultural areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing just a few blocks to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US 12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for less than half a mile (0.8 km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.
In Litchfield, M-99 enters the town from the southeast, passing near downtown where it meets the northern terminus of M-49. The highway leaves Litchfield heading northwest on Homer Road for a few miles before bending to the north as it crosses into Calhoun County. The trunkline passes through more farmland as it runs toward Homer on Hillsdale Street. In Homer, after passing through a roundabout, M-99 meets M-60, and the two highways run concurrently through the town to the northeast. The road briefly splits into a divided highway near the end of the concurrency; M-99 heads north, while M-60 continues eastward. From here, M-99 continues northward on 28 Mile Road toward the city of Albion. After crossing the Kalamazoo River in downtown, M-99 merges with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94). M-99 continues east concurrently with the business loop on Michigan Avenue passing near Albion College before heading back north to an interchange with I-94 at exit 124; this interchange marks the end of BL I-94 and M-99 continues northward on Eaton Rapids Road.

M-99 heads north through farmland to the village of Springport where it turns eastward along Main Street as it passes through the town. The highway continues easterly on Eaton Rapids Road before turning northward to cross into Eaton County. Shortly after crossing the county line, M-50 comes in from the southeast to meet up with M-99. The two highways travel together into Eaton Rapids. Together they form Main Street in the city before they separate on the north side of town. M-50 leaves to the northwest as Dexter Road, and M-99 continues to the northeast as Canal and Michigan streets. For the next few miles, the trunkline splits into a divided highway and runs parallel to the general course of the Grand River. M-99 crosses the river southeast of Dimondale after the opposing directions merge back together as an undivided highway. North of the river crossing, M-99 meets I-96 at the latter&#x27;s exit 101 on the southern border of Lansing.

From I-96, the M-99 continues north through residential neighborhoods into Lansing as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The highway travels northeasterly through the southern side of the capital city, as far as Jolly Road. There it turns northward through the Old Everett Neighborhood. The street is bordered by commercial properties in this area. M-99 widens into a boulevard as it passes the T-intersection with Victor Avenue, passing through the Moores Park neighborhood before crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the highway is bordered by the site of the former Lansing Car Assembly plant, which for a century produced Oldsmobiles and other GM cars. M-99 ends at a junction with I-496 just north of the assembly plant area at exit 5; Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard continues north from this interchange.

M-99 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-99 were the 32,262 vehicles daily north of Mount Hope Avenue in Lansing, on average; the lowest count was 2,300 vehicles per day between the state line and the M-34 junction. No section of M-99 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Previous designations===
When the state highway system was originally signed in 1919, M-99 was designated on a road between the Lake Michigan shoreline and M-11 (now US 31) between Muskegon and Hart. This highway was decommissioned in 1929. In 1931, M-99 was designated on a gravel road in the Upper Peninsula from US 2 just east of Gulliver) to Port Inland on Lake Michigan. This highway was decommissioned as well in 1939.

===Current designation===
In 1919, the highway that is now M-99 was first signed as M-64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M-34 from Hillsdale to the Litchfield area. In 1924, the western terminus of M-34 was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale; the remainder to Jonesville became an extension of the M-64.


In 1929, this version of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 traveled on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north from the corner of Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.

By 1947, M-99 was completely paved. One segment between Litchfield and Homer was converted back to gravel surface in 1952; a change that was reverted two years later. By 1960, the former US 12/M-99 concurrency through Albion was redesignated Business US 12 through the city when the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed. Within a year, that business loop was redesignated BL I-94 when the US 12 designation was removed from the freeway and applied to the former US 112; at the same time, the US 112/M-99 concurrency in Jonesville became US 12/M-99 as well.

A new alignment of M-99 highway was opened from the Ransom area north to Osseo in 1966; the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo and M-99 supplanted M-34 from Osseo to Hillsdale. The divided highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979.

The Michigan Department of State Highways first announced plans in 1970 to expand M-99 within the Lansing city limits. The plan called for conversion of M-99 to a boulevard between Victor and Pulaski streets, on the south side of the Grand River; after crossing the Grand River, the roadway would be split into a one-way pairing northerly to Kalamazoo Avenue, with northbound traffic along the existing routing on Logan Street and southbound traffic following Birch Street. Construction of such a routing was slated to displace of residential district and some businesses along Logan Street. Construction on this realignment began in 1973, and the boulevard routing from Victor to Pulaski opened in late 1977.

In 1989, Logan Street through Lansing was given an additional name, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. This dual-naming scheme lasted until 1994 when the Logan Street name was removed, leaving only Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

<text>Jewel Belair Staite (born June 2, 1982) is a Canadian actress. She is known for her roles as Kaylee Frye in the series &quot;Firefly&quot; (2002–2003) and its follow-up movie &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005), and as Jennifer Keller on science fiction television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (2007–2009). Staite also starred as Catalina in &quot;Space Cases&quot; (1996), as &quot;Becca&quot; Fisher in &quot;Flash Forward&quot; (1996–1997), as Raquel Westbrook in the Canadian drama &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot; (2012), and as Caroline Swift in AMC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Killing&quot; (2013–2014). Since 2021, she has starred as Abigail Bianchi in the Canadian legal drama series &quot;Family Law&quot;.

==Early life==
Staite was born in White Rock, British Columbia, the youngest of seven children. She has said that she is of British, Irish, French Canadian, and Iroquois ancestry. She began her career in early childhood, working both as a model and, from the age of six, as an actor. She attended Vancouver Film School and developed her stagecraft at the Vancouver Youth Theatre.

==Career==
Staite&#x27;s first high profile appearances as a child actor came in television movies such as CBC&#x27;s &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; in 1993 (which was later aired on CBS in the United States that same year) and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Only Way Out&quot;. In 1995, she had a key guest-starring role in a third-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Oubliette&quot;.

After appearing on &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; (1994), Staite&#x27;s first co-starring role on a television series was as Catalina, the ship&#x27;s engineer, in the first season of the Nickelodeon science fiction series &quot;Space Cases&quot; in 1996. This was immediately followed by her role as Rebecca &quot;Becca&quot; Fisher on the 1995–1997 Disney Channel series &quot;Flash Forward&quot;, a series in which Staite was the co-lead with Ben Foster.

In 2000, she was cast in a main role on the FOX Family Channel drama series &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. She was also a voice actress in the animated TV series &quot;Mummies Alive!&quot; and &quot;&quot; for DIC Entertainment.
Staite played Kaylee Frye in the short-lived television series &quot;Firefly&quot; and its subsequent 2005 film, &quot;Serenity&quot;. She wrote a chapter in the book &quot;Finding Serenity&quot;, called &quot;Kaylee Speaks: Jewel Staite On &quot;Firefly&quot;&quot;. She played the recurring role of Heidi Gotts in the television series &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; in 2004.

Staite played the role of head medical doctor Jennifer Keller in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; spinoff &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, making her one of three actors from the &quot;Firefly&quot; series to move on to appear in a &quot;Stargate&quot; series (the others being Adam Baldwin, who appeared in the episode &quot;Heroes&quot;, and Morena Baccarin, who played Adria in the tenth season of &quot;SG-1&quot;). She replaced Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett).
In the fifth season of &quot;Stargate&quot;, her character was changed from recurring status to part of the main cast. Before taking on the role as Dr. Keller, she previously played the Wraith child Ellia in the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode &quot;Instinct&quot;. She also appeared in the 2010 Syfy film, &quot;Mothman&quot;, under direction from Sheldon Wilson.
Also in 2010, Staite guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; as the love interest of Sheldon (played by Sean Maher, who played her love interest in &quot;Firefly&quot;), and in 2011, she guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot; as a former love interest of Sam.

In 2012, Staite was a series regular on &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot;, in which she portrayed Raquel Westbrook, a struggling actress. The show aired in Canada on CTV and MuchMusic and in the U.S. on The CW. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Listener&quot;. Staite appeared in 10 episodes of the AMC crime drama, &quot;The Killing&quot;, as Detective Stephen Holder&#x27;s girlfriend Caroline Swift, from 2013–2014.

==Personal life==
Staite was married to actor Matt Anderson from 2003 to 2011. In 2015, she became engaged to her boyfriend Charlie Ritchie. In May 2015, she announced she was pregnant with her first child, a boy, who was born later that year. She and Ritchie married on July 23, 2016.
