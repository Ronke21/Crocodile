<text>Firearms regulation in Finland incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of firearms usage in the country. Both hunting and shooting sports are common hobbies. There are approximately 300,000 people with hunting permits, and 34,000 people belong to sport shooting clubs. Over 1,500 people are licensed weapons collectors. Additionally, many reservists practice their skills using their own semi-automatic rifles and pistols after military service.

Legal firearms in Finland must be registered and licensed on a per-gun basis. There are approximately 1.5 million registered small firearms in the country. Out of those, 226,000 are short firearms (pistols, revolvers) with the rest being long firearms (rifles, shotguns). There are approximately 650,000 people with at least one permit, which means 12% of Finns own a firearm. Overall, legal gun ownership rate is similar to countries such as Sweden, France, Canada and Germany. Estimates place the number of illegal, unregistered firearms between some tens of thousands and upwards of a million. A large portion of these are thought to be weapons hidden during the aftermath of World War II.

The current Firearms Act of 1998 is a near full rewrite of the earlier, 1933 law. The law was revised to comply with the European Firearms Directive after Finland joined the European Union. Following the school shooting incidents in 2007 and 2008 in which the perpetrators used .22 caliber semi-automatic pistols, legislation regarding short firearms was considerably tightened in 2011. Nevertheless, no types of firearms are outright banned, and in principle a person can apply for a licence for any type of gun.

== Regulation ==

The ownership and use of firearms is regulated by the Firearms Act of 1998. A license is always needed for possession of a firearm and all firearms are registered. Firearms may only be carried while they are being used for a specific purpose (e.g. hunting, shooting at the range). When transporting a firearm to or from such activity, the firearm must be unloaded and stored in a case or pouch. The owner of a firearm is responsible for making sure that firearms and ammunition do not end up in unauthorized hands. The exact requirements regarding storage of firearms depends on their type and quantity.

Air guns up to 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) in caliber are not regulated regardless of their muzzle energy. Larger bore air weapons need a permit, unless the person already holds a firearms licence. Bows and crossbows are not regulated items in Finland, while pepper spray is. Suppressors are considered firearm components, but can be used without requiring any separate licensing. Magazine capacity is restricted under a normal license, for a maximum of 21 rounds for short guns and 11 rounds for a long gun. There is no regulation regarding other firearm accessories.

An unlicensed person may use firearms only under direct supervision. Simple unlawful possession of a firearm is punishable by fine or up to two years in prison, although more severe punishments may apply e.g. in the case of fully automatic weapons or when used to commit other crime. However, an unlicensed firearm may always be turned in without repercussions, provided this happens at the initiative of the person in possession of the firearm.

Certain types of ammunition, such as expanding pistol rounds or incendiary rounds, require special authorization (in addition to a firearms licence) to purchase. The amount of ammunition a person may possess is not limited by the Firearms Act. However, legislation related to the safe storage of explosive materials does apply. Ordinarily, this means a maximum of 20,000 rounds of ammunition (including loose primers) and 2 kg of gunpowder per household, with larger quantities requiring separate storage.

==Proposed changes to regulation==

Currently, work is underway to streamline the license application process in straightforward cases. An applicant who already has existing permits and has a proven track-record with responsible ownership would be able to apply for further permits more easily.

In 2017, the EU adopted changes to the Firearms Directive that became known as the &quot;EU Gun Ban&quot;. In local implementation, the major change to firearms users will be that self-loading rifle and pistol magazines with a capacity of more than 10 and 20 respectively will become more strictly controlled. Under the new law, they will only be available to sports shooters and reservists, but not hunters. Being knowingly in (unlicensed) possession of such a magazine will cause any firearms licenses to be revoked. 

== Licensing ==

When applying for a licence to purchase a firearm, the applicant must fill in a form with information such as the type and mode of operation of firearm, and the intended purpose of use (although one can use any firearm for any legal purpose regardless of the original application, e.g. a range gun for hunting or vice versa). According to the law, the firearm must be appropriate for the stated purpose, but evaluating this is largely left to the discretion of the police. For example, while an AR-15 is suitable for practical shooting, the police may consider one inappropriate for hunting.

Valid reasons for obtaining a firearms license are:

The application process includes a check of criminal records, the police interviewing the applicant and in some cases a computer-based personality test or a medical health certificate. Any significant history with violence or other crime, substance abuse or mental health issues will cause the application to be rejected. Membership in a hunting or shooting club or other appropriate organization is considered a positive, though membership can not be legally required as the Constitution of Finland guarantees freedom of association.

If the application is approved, an acquisition permit is mailed to the applicant. A dealer (or private person) may only sell a firearm if the buyer has the appropriate paperwork to show. There is no waiting period as such, but in practice processing an application takes a minimum of several days, usually a few weeks. Licences can be valid either until further notice or for a fixed term, which is sometimes the case for a people applying for their first license, and always with the first pistol license. A licence-holder may also borrow other firearms from the same or lesser category (e.g. a rifle licence is valid for borrowing shotguns and small-caliber rifles, but not pistols) and purchase ammunition for any firearm he owns or is permitted to borrow.

Classification of firearms

For legal purposes, firearms are divided into 13 different types:

A firearm is considered a short firearm if its overall length is at most 600mm, or its barrel length at most 300mm. In any other case the firearm is considered a long firearm. 

Firearms are further divided into four modes of operation:

Sub-compact pistols

A pistol is considered sub-compact or a &quot;pocket gun&quot; if it fits in a rectangular box of 180 x 130 mm. Special legislation applies to these easily concealed firearms and they are not licensed for sporting purposes. Some common pistols such as Glock 19 fall under this description, and are therefore generally unavailable to e.g. IPSC shooters in Finland.

Specially dangerous firearms

Some types of firearms are considered &quot;specially dangerous&quot;. Licences for such firearms can only be granted on a very limited basis and are essentially for recognized collectors and filming purposes only. A firearm is considered specially dangerous if:

* its mode of operation is automatic fire
* it is a cannon, rocket launcher or comparable weapon system
* it is disguised as another object

With the changes to the EU Firearms Directive, rifles with a magazine capacity of more than 10 cartridges and pistols with a magazine capacity of more than 20 cartridges were put into category A, or prohibited weapons. In Finnish nomenclature these firearms were added to the specially dangerous category, which essentially restricts their availability to established practical shooters and those actively participating in reservist activities. The same firearms can be used with lower capacity magazines without being considered specially dangerous. 

Short-barreled rifles and carbines

Short-barreled rifles and pistol carbines fall under the any other firearm category and, while not restricted by law, are more difficult to get a licence for. The primary concern is again that, being easy to conceal, they are particularly dangerous should they be stolen and fall into criminal hands.

== Personal protection and self-defense ==

In the 1980s and 1990s, roughly 7% of firearm licenses were granted for the purpose of personal protection. However they have stopped giving licences on that basis, although existing permits remain valid. It is still possible to obtain a licence for pepper spray for the purpose of self-defense if a concrete threat exists. Carrying a firearm licensed for hunting or sporting use outside of that specific activity is not allowed. One can nevertheless legally defend oneself by any means available, including firearms. Any use of force must always be proportional to the threat.

== Role in crimes ==

Between 2010 and 2015, firearms were used in 15% of all homicides. In 73% of these the firearm was illegally possessed by the perpetrator.

The two school shootings in Jokela in 2007 and Kauhajoki in 2008 are by far the worst peacetime mass murders in Finland, with 8 and 10 victims, respectively. In both cases the perpetrator was armed with a 0.22 rimfire pistol licensed only shortly before. In the case of Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the original application was for a 9 mm pistol, but this was rejected. In the aftermath police were blamed for being too lax in issuing licences, as neither perpetrator had any significant history with sports shooting. Police defended their decision, stating that nothing suspicious had come up with the information available, so there was no reason to reject the application. Legislation was revised in 2011 and now pistol licenses can only be issued following a two-year period of documented, active pistol shooting hobby, and only to persons 20 years old or older.

== Role in suicides ==

In 2013, firearms (both legally and illegally held) were used in 18% of suicides. Some consider this a problem and would like to see stricter firearms legislation. Others point out that the number of suicides is already steadily going down, while the number of firearms has remained constant. 

== Military reserve ==
Military service guns are stored by the Finnish Defence Forces, and are only given out during reservist training or mobilization.

<doc id="719614" wikidata="Q848840" url="?curid=719614" title="Brachiation">
<text>Brachiation (from &quot;brachium&quot;, Latin for &quot;arm&quot;), or arm swinging, is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This form of locomotion is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Gibbons in particular use brachiation for as much as 80% of their locomotor activities. Some New World monkeys, such as spider monkeys and muriquis, were initially classified as &quot;semibrachiators&quot; and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand. Evidence has shown that the extinct ape &quot;Proconsul&quot; from the Miocene of East Africa developed an early form of suspensory behaviour, and was therefore referred to as a &quot;probrachiator.&quot;

Upon further observations and more in depth understandings of the anatomy and behaviour of primates, the terms semibrachiator and probrachiator have largely fallen out of favour within the scientific community. Currently, researchers classify gibbons and siamangs as the only true brachiators and classify the great apes as modified brachiators. All other brachiation behaviours that do not meet either of these classifications are referred to as forearm suspensory postures and locomotion.

Some traits that allow primates to brachiate include a short spine (particularity the lumbar spine), short fingernails (instead of claws), long curved fingers, reduced thumbs, long forelimbs and freely rotating wrists. Modern humans retain many physical characteristics that suggest a brachiator ancestor, including flexible shoulder joints and fingers well-suited for grasping. In lesser apes, these characteristics were adaptations for brachiation. Although great apes do not normally brachiate (with the exception of orangutans), human anatomy suggests that brachiation may be an exaptation to bipedalism, and healthy modern humans are still capable of brachiating. Some children&#x27;s parks include monkey bars which children play on by brachiating.

As well as shaping the evolution of gibbon body structure, brachiation has influenced the style and order of their behaviour. For example, unlike other primates who carry infants on their back, gibbons will carry young ventrally. It also affects their play activities, copulation, and fighting. It is thought that gibbons gain evolutionary advantages through brachiation and being suspended by both hands (&quot;bimanual suspension&quot;) when feeding. While smaller primates cannot hold themselves by both hands for long periods, and larger primates are too heavy to exploit food resources on the ends of branches, gibbons can remain suspended for a significant period and use their long arms to reach food in terminal branches more easily. Another theory postulates that brachiation is a quieter and less obvious mode of locomotion than quadrupedal jumping and climbing thereby more successfully avoiding predators.

==Types of brachiation==

===Continuous contact===

This form of brachiation occurs when the primate is moving at slower speeds and is characterized by the animal maintaining constant contact with a handhold, such as a tree branch. This gait type utilizes the passive exchange between two types of energy, gravitational potential and translational kinetic, to propel the animal forward at a low mechanical cost. This mode of brachiation has been compared to the movement patterns of bipedal walking in humans.

===Ricochetal===

This type of brachiation is used by primates to move at faster speeds and is characterized by a flight phase between each contact with a handhold. Ricochetal brachiation uses an exchange of translational and rotational kinetic energy to move forward, and is compared to a &quot;whip-like&quot; motion. Due to its aerial phase, ricochetal brachiation is similar to bipedal running in humans.

== Models of brachiation ==
===Pendulum movement===

Continuous contact brachiation has often been compared to the movement of a simple pendulum. This is due to the out-of-phase fluctuation of energy that occurs while the moving primate is swinging between each tree appendage as the energy transfers from potential to kinetic, and vice versa. The use of gravitational acceleration to effect movement can be found in both the brachiating primate and the moving ball in a pendulum model. A brachiator can make use of this momentum in several different ways: during the downswing the primate can maximize its change in kinetic energy, during the upswing it can minimize loss of kinetic energy or it can avoid moving laterally during its upward swing. Brachiating primates have adapted these three strategies for maximizing forward movement by adjusting its posture during each swing.

The amount of energy transferred from potential to kinetic during pendulum-like movement is known as energy recovery. Maintaining a higher energy recovery during brachiation costs less energy and allows the animal to move to its destination quickly, however, this type of movement is also harder to control. Therefore, since the risk of missing a handhold can result in injury or death, the benefit of moving slower with a lower energy recovery and more control likely outweighs the cost of extra energy expenditure.

==Evolution of brachiation==
Brachiation originated in Africa, thirteen million years ago. The emergence of bigger primates that learn to move hanging around by branches obliges the new generations to make some corporal changes that have lasted until today, in many species, including the humans.

Specialized locomotor behaviours, such as brachiating, are thought to have evolved from arboreal quadrupedalism. This behaviour is the ancestral and most common locomotor mechanism among primates. This would explain why living apes and humans share many unusual morphological aspects of the upper limb and thorax. The transition to brachiation is regarded as a major shift during primate evolution and is thought to be a possible precursor to the adaptation of bipedal walking in early hominids. Specialized suspensory behaviour was shown to have evolved independently between hominid groups.

There are several hypotheses for how early brachiating primates may have transitioned into bipedalism. The most generally accepted of these is the vertical climbing hypothesis, which states that vertical climbing is the biomechanical link between brachiation and bipedalism. Many climbing adaptations have been found in early hominins and some of these adaptations can still be seen in present day humans. The distinctive body posture, limb proportions and trunk design identified in living apes are better explained by the previous adaptation of climbing behaviours.

<text>The Somali Region (, , ), also known as Ogadenia (Soomaali Galbeed) () and officially the Somali Regional State, is a regional state in eastern Ethiopia. Its territory is the largest. The regional state borders the Ethiopian regions of Afar and Oromia to the west, as well as Djibouti to the north, Somalia to the northeast, east and south; and Kenya to the southwest.

Jijiga is the capital of the Somali Region (Ogadenia).

The Somali regional government is composed of the executive branch, led by the President; the legislative branch, which comprises the State Council; and the judicial branch, which is led by the State Supreme Court.

== Overview ==
What is now the Somali Region was part of the conquests of Menelik II in the late 19th century. 

The Somali Region formed a large part of the pre-1995 provinces of Hararghe, Bale and Sidamo. The population is predominantly Somali, and there have been attempts to incorporate the area into a Greater Somalia. In the 1977, Somalia invaded Ethiopia, igniting the Ogaden War, which Somalia lost due to timely military intervention from the Soviet Union and its ally Cuba. Despite this defeat, local groups still tried either to become part of Somalia or independent.

The 2007 Abole oil field raid, in which 72 Chinese and Ethiopian oilfield workers were killed, has led to a series of military reprisals against the rebel group ONLF Ogaden National Liberation Front.

Until its first-ever district elections in February 2004, Zonal and woreda administrators and village chairmen were appointed by the Regional government. Senior politicians at the Regional level nominated their clients to the local government positions. In the 2004 local elections, each woreda elected a council including a spokesman, vice-spokesman, administrator, and vice-administrator. These councils have the responsibility of managing budgets and development activities within their respective districts.

== Demographics ==
Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the Somali Region has a total population of 4,439,147, consisting of 2,468,784 men and 1,970,363 women; urban residents numbered 621,210 or 14% of the population, while rural residents numbered 3,817,937. With an estimated area of 327,068 square kilometers, this region has an estimated density of 20.9 people per square kilometer. For the entire region 1, 685,986 households were counted, which results in an average for the Region of 6.8 persons to a household, with urban households having on average 6 and rural households 6.5 people. 

There are 8 refugee camps and 1 transit center, housing 212,967 refugees from Somalia, located in Somali Region.

In the previous census, conducted in 1994, the region&#x27;s population was reported to be 3,383,165, of which Somalis made up 3,236,667. There were 1,846,417 were males and 1,537,748 were females. The urban residents of the Somali Region numbered 492,710 households, with an average of 6.6 persons per household; a high sex ratio of 120 males to 100 females was reported. As of 1997, the ethnic composition of the Region was 99.01% Somali, 0.30% Amhara, 0.5% Oromo; all other ethnic groups made up 0.2% of the population. 

According to the CSA, , 38.98% of the total population had access to safe drinking water, of whom 21.32% were rural inhabitants and 77.21% were urban. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Somali include the following: 71.8% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 22% and for women 9.8%; and the Regional infant mortality rate is 57 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is less than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants’ first month of life.
The region is home to almost all major Somali clan families with the majority being from the Ogaden tribe of Darod comprising 65% of the total population. Except for Liben and Sitti provinces, the Ogaden clan have a majority presence in all the other nine zones. Various subclans of the Darod clan family primarily inhabit the central and eastern parts of the region, with the Ogaden and Jidwaq inhabiting the interior as well as the major towns of Jijiga, Gode, Kebridehar. The Harti as well as the Leelkase clans inhabit the Dollo zone where they make up the majority while the Marehan clan inhabit the Shilavo woreda and the Liben zone. 

The Akisho clan, Issa, Gadabuursi and Jaarso subclans of the Dir primarily inhabit the northern Sitti zone, Awbare and Gursum woreda in Fafan zone.

The Habr Awal, Garhajis, Arap and Habr Je&#x27;lo clans of the Isaaq clan family inhabit the northern part of the region bordering Somaliland. The Sacad Muse subclan of the Habr Awal have large settlements in the Fafan Zone where they respectively make up in Harshin, Hart Sheik, and Wajaale (Ethiopian Side) towns. The Arap inhabit Fafan and also settle and border Kebri Beyah. The Garhajis and Habr Je&#x27;lo make up the majority of Awaare and Misrak Gashamo woredas in Jarar zone woreda.

Degodia being majority in Liben and significant presence in some regions. The Akisho Dir, Karanle and Sheekhaal present in the western areas bordering the Oromia region and the Hawadle and Habar Gidir subclans are present in the Shabelle zone. The closely related Samaale subclan of Garre are also present in the Liben zone and Dawa zone where they make up the majority.

=== Languages ===
Somali as a primary language is spoken by 95.89% of the inhabitants. All other languages spoken together make up 4.11%.

=== Religion ===
99.74% of the population are Muslim, All other religions together made up 0.26%.

== Agriculture ==

The CSA of Ethiopia estimated in 2005 that farmers in the Somali Region had a total of 2,459,720 cattle (representing 15.19%% of Ethiopia&#x27;s total cattle), 2,463,000 sheep (27.66%), 3,650,970 goats (60.02%), 1,991,550 donkeys (42.66%), 5,3165,260 camels (96.2%), 154,670 poultry of all species (0.5%), and 5,330 beehives (0.12%). For nomadic inhabitants, the CSA provided two sets of estimates, one based on aerial surveys and the other on more conventional methodology:

== Transportation ==

=== Ground travel ===
West from Addis Ababa, Awash 572 km via Harar and Jijiga to Degehabur

=== Air travel ===
Somali Regional State has 3 international airport and 2 commercial airports. The international airports are Jijiga Airport, Gode Airport, and Kabri Dar Airport, The 2 commercial airports are Dolo Airport, and Shilavo Airport.

== Government ==

=== Executive branch ===
The executive branch is headed by the Chief Administrator of Somali Regional State. The current Chief Administrator is Mustafa Muhummed Omer (Cagjar), elected on 22 August 2018. A Vice President of Somali Region succeeds the president in the event of any removal from office, and performs any duties assigned by the president. The current vice president is Adam Farah Ibrahim. The other offices in the executive branch cabinet are the Regional Health Bureau, Educational Bureau, and 18 other officials.

==== List of Chief Administrators of Somali Region ====
=== Judicial branch ===
There are three levels of the Somali region judiciary. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each woreda maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over all justiciable matters. The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Four courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in an administrative zone. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The highest-ranking court, the Somali Supreme Court, is Somali&#x27;s &quot;court of last resort&quot;. A Seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters. The chief judge is called the Chief of Soamli Supreme Court Abdullahi Saed Omar.

=== Legislative branch ===
The State Council, which is the highest administrative body of the state, is made up of 269 members.

=== National politics ===
Somali is represented by
* 6 representatives in The House of Federation (upper chamber) and
* 24 representatives in The House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives (lower chamber)

<text>The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (Maxwell School) is the professional public policy school of Syracuse University, a private research university in Syracuse, New York. The school is organized in 11 academic departments and 13 affiliated research centers and offers coursework in the fields of public administration, international relations, foreign policy, political Science, science and technology policy, social sciences, and economics through its undergraduate (BA) degrees, graduate Master of Public Affairs (MPA), Master of Arts (MA), and PhD degrees.

The school has been recognized as one of the world&#x27;s best graduate schools of public affairs. It awards the oldest public administration degree in the United States.

==History==
The precursor to the Maxwell School was the Training School for Public Service, founded by New York City’s Bureau of Municipal Research, which was transferred to Syracuse University in 1924. The school was initially a vehicle for municipal reform, its students serving as a pool of researchers tasked with uncovering examples of the corruption of Tammany Hall.

The school gained its name after George Holmes Maxwell, a Boston-based patent attorney and Syracuse alumni. In 1924, Maxwell donated $500,000 to the university to establish a school which would aim &quot;to cull from every source those principles, facts, and elements which, combined, make up our rights and duties and our value and distinctiveness as United States citizens.&quot; 
 Maxwell&#x27;s initial interest was in training all undergraduates for their roles as informed citizens in the American democracy; University officials convinced him the school should also provide professional training for future government officials and other public servants.

The Maxwell School was dedicated on October 3, 1924, and was the first program to offer a graduate professional degree in public administration. That Master of Public Administration program is the oldest continuously operating, university-based MPA in the United States.

In 1937, the school took its full name and moved into Maxwell Hall, a purpose-built building on the west end of Syracuse University&#x27;s main campus. The hall was dedicated by president Herbert Hoover on November 12, 1937. In that year, Syracuse University&#x27;s graduate programs and undergraduate instruction in the social sciences were moved into Maxwell, giving the school the unusual hybrid structure that remains today.

In 1968, Maxwell professor Dwight Waldo presided over the Minnowbrook I conference, which established the foundations for New Public Administration. Subsequent Minnowbrook II and III conferences were held in 1988 and 2008 at the eponymous Blue Mountain Lake retreat.

The school&#x27;s rapid growth necessitated the 1990 &quot;Campaign for Maxwell&quot;, which raised capital to fund a new building to accommodate the expansion. The &quot;Holden Observatory&quot;, built in 1887, was moved to create space for a new 5-story building. The result of the campaign was the Bohlin Cywinski Jackson-designed Eggers Hall, which opened in 1994. Eggers Hall adjoins Maxwell Hall at the corner, together forming an L-shaped complex that houses the present-day Maxwell School.

In 2013, the Maxwell School and the Center for Strategic and International Studies entered into a collaborative agreement that included headquartering all Maxwell operations at CSIS.

<text>Kelvim José Escobar Bolívar (born April 11, 1976) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1997–2003) and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004–2007, 2009). He won 101 games, but his career was cut short by shoulder injuries.

==Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays===

<text>The Reading and Leeds Festivals are a pair of annual music festivals that take place in Reading and Leeds in England. The events take place simultaneously on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend. The Reading Festival is held at Little John&#x27;s Farm on Richfield Avenue in central Reading, near Caversham Bridge. The Leeds event is held in Bramham Park, near Wetherby, the grounds of a historic house. Headliners and most supporting acts typically play at both sites, with Reading&#x27;s Friday line up becoming Leeds&#x27; Saturday line-up, Reading&#x27;s Saturday line-up playing at Leeds on Sunday, and Leeds&#x27; Friday line-up attending Reading on Sunday. Campsites are available at both sites and weekend tickets include camping. Day tickets are also sold.

The Reading Festival, the older of the two festivals, is the longest-running popular music festival in the UK. Many of the biggest bands in the UK and internationally have played at the festival over five decades. The festival has had various musical phases over the years, but since the current two-site format was adopted in 1999, rock, alternative, indie, punk, and metal have been the main genres featured in the line-up. More recently hip hop has comprised an increasing proportion of the lineup, including headline sets by artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Eminem and Post Malone.

The festivals are run by Festival Republic, which was divested from Mean Fiddler Music Group. From 1998 to 2007, the festivals were known as the &quot;Carling Weekend: Reading&quot; and the &quot;Carling Weekend: Leeds&quot; for promotional purposes. In November 2007, the sponsored title was abolished after nine years and the Reading Festival reclaimed its original name. 
In 2011, the capacity of the Reading site was 87,000, and the Leeds site was 75,000, an increase of several thousand on previous years.

==History==

The Reading Festival was originally known as the National Jazz Festival, which was conceived by Harold Pendleton (founder of the Marquee Club in London in 1958) and first held at Richmond Athletic Ground in 1961. Throughout the 1960s, the festival moved between several London and Home Counties sites, being held at Windsor Racecourse, Kempton Park, Sunbury and Plumpton, before reaching its permanent home at Reading in 1971. Since 1964, when the festival added a Friday evening session to the original Saturday and Sunday format, it has been staged over three days, with the sole exception of 1970 when a fourth day was added, running from Thursday 6 to Sunday 9 August.

===1960s===
The National Jazz Federation (NJF) Festival was established at the height of the trad jazz boom, as a successor to the Beaulieu Jazz Festival, initially as a two-day event held at Richmond Athletic Ground. The line-up for the first two years was made up exclusively of jazz performers, but in 1963, several rhythm &amp; blues acts were added to the bill, including the Rolling Stones, Georgie Fame, and Long John Baldry, and by 1965, such acts were in the majority, with jazz sessions reduced to Saturday and Sunday afternoons only. This format continued until 1967 when jazz was limited to just the Saturday afternoon session. By 1969, jazz had disappeared entirely from the line-up.

In 1964, a Friday evening session was added to the existing weekend format. In 1966, the NJF Festival moved to the larger Windsor Racecourse. The following year a second stage (the Marquee Stage) was added, but when the festival was moved to Sunbury in 1968 it reverted to a single-stage format. The festival was held at Plumpton Racecourse in 1969 and 1970.

===1970s===

After moving to Reading, the festival&#x27;s line-up became primarily composed of progressive rock, blues and hard rock during the early and mid 1970s, and then became the first music festival to incorporate punk rock and new wave in the late 1970s, when the Jam, Sham 69, and the Stranglers were among the headline acts. The festival&#x27;s attempts to cater for both traditional rock acts and punk and new wave bands occasionally led to clashes between the two sets of fans at the end of the 1970s, though the festival gradually became known for focusing on heavy metal and rock acts.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, the festival followed a similar format to that established in the late 1970s, with leading rock and heavy metal acts performing on the last two days, and a more varied line-up including punk and new wave bands on the opening day.

====Council ban====
In 1984 and 1985, the Conservative-run local council effectively banned the festival by designating the festival site for development and refusing to grant licences for any alternative sites in the Reading area.

In 1984, many acts were already booked and tickets were on sale, with Marillion due to headline. The promoters tried in vain to find a new site but a proposed move to Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire failed. The proposed line-up was published in &quot;Soundcheck&quot; free music paper issue 12 as: Friday 24 August – Hawkwind, Boomtown Rats, Snowy White, the Playn Jayn, Dumpy&#x27;s Rusty Nuts, Wildfire, Chelsea Eloy, Tracy Lamb, New Torpedoes; Saturday 25 – Jethro Tull, Hanoi Rocks, Steve Hackett, Club Karlsson, Nazareth, Twelfth Night, Thor, Silent Running, New Model Army, IQ, the Roaring Boys, She; Sunday 26 – Marillion, Grand Slam, the Bluebells, Helix, Clannad, the Opposition, the Enid, Young Blood, Scorched Earth, and Terraplane).

After Labour regained control of the council in 1986, permission was given for fields adjacent to the original festival site to be used, and a line-up was put together at short notice.

The following year saw a record attendance, headlined by the Mission, Alice Cooper and Status Quo.

====Late 1980s / early 1990s slump====
1988 saw an attempt to take the festival in a mainstream commercial pop direction, featuring acts including Starship, Squeeze, Hothouse Flowers, Bonnie Tyler and Meat Loaf (who was bottled off stage), and the subsequent disputes led to the ousting of original festival promoter Harold Pendleton by the Mean Fiddler Music Group organisation.

Pendleton attempted to relocate the festival to a new site near Newbury using the name &quot;Redding Festival&quot;, but threats of legal action by the new promoters of the original festival, as well as a reluctance by Newbury District Council to issue a licence for the proposed Newbury Showground venue, blocked Pendleton&#x27;s plans. Meanwhile, the official Reading Festival, now managed by Mean Fiddler, continued at the Thames-side site in Reading, with a predominantly goth and indie music policy that alienated much of the traditional fan base and saw attendances plummet.

Attendances continued to fall between 1989 and 1991, but began to recover from 1992, when new organisers took over from the Mean Fiddler group, broadening the festival&#x27;s musical policy.

===1990s===
In 1991, Nirvana made the first of their two appearances at Reading, midway down the bill. The following year, in 1992, they played what would be their last UK concert, which was released as a live album/DVD &quot;Live at Reading&quot; in November 2009. Singer Kurt Cobain came onstage in a wheelchair pushed by music journalist Everett True and wearing a medical gown, parodying speculations about his mental health. The 1992 festival was hit by extreme weather, with a thunderstorm on the Saturday drenching the site, leaving it ankle-deep in mud, and blowing away the Comedy Tent.

====Festival expansion====
By the mid-1990s, the festival had begun to regain its former status as the popularity of UK outdoor festivals increased. Britpop and indie began to appear on the bill alongside the traditional rock and metal acts, and rap acts such as Ice Cube began to appear regularly on the main stage, to mixed receptions. Public Enemy headlined the second day of the 1992 festival. Beastie Boys were about halfway down the bill for day three.

In 1996, the Stone Roses played the last gig before their break-up at the festival.

In 1998, the Reading Festival absorbed the failed Phoenix Festival, resulting in an on-stage dispute between Beastie Boys and the Prodigy over the song &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot;.

In 1999, the festival added a second venue at Temple Newsam in Leeds, the site of V Festival in 1997 and 1998, due to increasing demand. In the first year, all bands performed at the Leeds site the day after they played Reading, with the Reading Festival running from Friday to Sunday and the Leeds Festival running from Saturday to Monday. However, in 2001, the festival moved to the current format, wherein the Reading line-up plays at Leeds the following day, with the opening day line-up from Leeds playing the final day in Reading (with the exceptions of 2009 and 2010 when the bands playing Leeds played Reading the following day, and the bands on the opening day of Reading closed Leeds).

===2000s===

After a successful first year in Leeds, the increasing popularity of outdoor music festivals led to the Reading Festival selling out quicker every year. However, the Leeds Festival was plagued by riots and violence, which led to problems in retaining its licence. The worst incidents occurred in 2002, following which the festival was moved to Bramham Park north-east of Leeds. Since then, security at both sites has increased and problems have been reduced.

The early 2000s saw a varied but predominantly rock line-up, though as the decade progressed the Main Stage and Radio 1 Stage featured many indie bands.

Despite being predominantly a rock festival, several hip-hop artists have appeared at the festival over the years, including Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, Beastie Boys, Eminem, Xzibit, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Dizzee Rascal, and the Streets.

In 2005, the main stages at both Reading and Leeds were made larger, featuring cantilevered video screens. The same year the Reading Fringe Festival was established in Reading, with venues in the town hosting acts hoping to draw crowds and industry figures from the larger festival. The Reading Fringe has run annually since then.

====Banning of flags and banners====
Flags were banned from both festival sites in 2009, with the organisers citing health and safety concerns. Flags and banners had been a traditional part of the Reading Festival since the early 1970s, originally used to enable motorcycle groups and others to identify themselves and find each other inside the main arena.

===2010s===

Reading Festival continued to expand through the early 2010s, with a new record capacity of 105,000 recorded in 2019. In the same year, 200 artists played at both festivals.

The festival typically has the following stages:
*Main Stage – major rock, indie, metal and alternative acts.
*&quot;NME&quot;/Radio 1 stage – less well-known acts, building up to an alternative headline act.
*Dance tent – dance music acts, previously sharing a day with the Lock Up stage, now a stand-alone 3-day stage.
*Lock Up Stage (also known as Pit Stage) – underground punk and hardcore acts. Due to demand, from 2006 this stage took up two days rather than previous years where it was only one day.
*Festival Republic stage – acts with less popular appeal and breakthrough acts.
*1Xtra Stage – new stage for 2013 that stages Hip-Hop, RnB and Rap artists.
*Alternative tent – comedy and cabaret acts plus DJs.
*BBC Introducing Stage – Typically unsigned/not well known acts. (Formerly known as the Topman Unsigned Stage at the Leeds site).

===2020s===
On 12 May 2020, it was announced that the year&#x27;s festivals were cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The festivals were due to host Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s first UK show in 10 years, along with Stormzy and Liam Gallagher&#x27;s first appearances as headliners. The 2021 festival included two main stages with six headliners, among them Stormzy and Liam Gallagher from the previous year&#x27;s line up.

In 2022, Festival Republic came under fire following a number of incidents at both festival sites. At Reading, multiple fires were reported, as well as mugs, chairs, cups and other objects being thrown. Stabbings were also reported. At Leeds, 16-year-old David Celino died after it was suspected he had taken ecstasy.

==Bottling incidents==
Bottling acts off stage (being forced off stage by a barrage of audience-thrown bottles and cans) is a frequent occurrence at the festival. During the 1970s and 1980s, there were often mass-participation can and bottle fights, and unpopular bands have been bottled offstage throughout the festival&#x27;s history since the first large-scale &quot;cannings&quot; of 1973 and 1974. Examples include:

*Punk band the Hellions, featuring ex-Damned guitarist Brian James, were booked on an otherwise 100% heavy metal line-up on the Friday of the 1980 Festival and left the stage in less than a minute following an assault of cans, bottles and pork pies. &quot;I Canned the Hellions at Reading&quot; T-shirts were on sale at souvenir stands within the hour.
*In 1983, reggae act Steel Pulse left within moments of arriving on stage under an avalanche of missiles launched by punks and rockers waiting to see the Stranglers.
*John Waite and the No Brakes Band quit the stage on the Saturday of the 1986 festival when their drummer was hit in the head by a 12&quot; vinyl disc.
*In 1988, Bonnie Tyler completed her set despite being pelted with bottles and turf. The same day&#x27;s headliner Meat Loaf left 20 minutes into his set after being hit by a full two-litre cider bottle. After an initially positive reception Meat Loaf angered the audience by berating them for their treatment of his friend Bonnie Tyler earlier in the day, then stormed off stage when met with a volley of burgers and bottles. He eventually returned shouting &quot;Do you wanna rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll or do you wanna throw stuff?&quot; Ten seconds later the cider bottle struck him in the face, at which point he left the stage permanently.
*In 2000, Daphne and Celeste were scheduled on the main stage for a short two song set and were bottled throughout.
*In 2003, Good Charlotte stopped their set 20 minutes short and encouraged the crowd to throw bottles all at the same time after a count of three after being pelted by bottles throughout their set.
*In 2004, 50 Cent was pelted with bottles, mud and an inflatable paddling pool during his set. 50 Cent was on stage for just under 20 minutes before throwing his microphone into the crowd in anger. The Rasmus were also bottled off after one song.
*In 2006 at Reading, Panic! at the Disco lead singer Brendon Urie was struck in the face with a plastic bottle and fell unconscious, forcing the rest of the band to stop mid-song as he lay on the floor. Urie received medical treatment from his road crew for several minutes before regaining consciousness, and the band subsequently continued the song from the point at which it was interrupted. The same year, My Chemical Romance were heckled by a small group of angry audience members. Lead singer Gerard Way encouraged the crowd to throw bottles at them instead, and the band were pelted with golf balls and bottles of urine, among other items.
*In 2008, a crowd of approximately 3,000 people attended the &quot;BBC Introducing&quot; Stage at Reading to see unsigned band the FF&#x27;ers, following rumours that it would actually be a secret Foo Fighters gig, and the band were subjected to a large amount of abuse from the audience, including several bottles launched at the band.
*In 2016, Tyler Joseph of Twenty One Pilots was attacked and robbed as he attempted to crowd-surf in the Radio One Tent. Reacting unfavourably to his behaviour, the hostile audience threw him to the ground, ripped off various items of his clothing and stole his ski-mask. Joseph was eventually rescued by security guards, who carried him to an elevated platform where he announced that the band&#x27;s set was over.

<text>The Source is an American hip hop and entertainment website, and a magazine that publishes annually or . It is the world&#x27;s longest-running rap periodical, being founded as a newsletter in 1988 by David Mays.

In 1999 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that, based on data from Alliance for Audited Media, formerly known as Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America), the print edition of &quot;The Source&quot; was &quot;the No. 1-selling music magazine on newsstands in America.&quot; By 2009, they were among those losing readership and advertising income.

The 1995 Source Awards were noted for their effect on the hip-hop landscape, particularly in escalating tension between the East and West Coast hip-hop communities, which likely precipitated the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls.

==History==
The magazine&#x27;s website began in 1998. At that point the monthly print magazine was celebrating its 100th issue.

Others who were involved as co-owners/editors include Raymond &#x27;Ray Benzino&#x27; Leon Scott. Between 2005 and 2010 the magazine did not award any of its &#x27;5 mic&#x27; awards.

==&quot;The Source&quot;″s Five-Mic albums==
The Record Report is a section in the publication in which the magazine&#x27;s staff rates hip-hop albums. Ratings range from one to five mics, paralleling a typical five-star rating scale. An album that is rated at four-and-a-half or five mics is considered by &quot;The Source&quot; to be a superior hip hop album. Over the first ten years or so, the heralded five-mic rating only applied to albums that were universally lauded hip hop albums. A total of 45 albums have been awarded five mics; a complete, chronological list is below.

<text>William Isiah Bassett (27 January 1869 – 8 April 1937) was an English association footballer, director, and club chairman who served West Bromwich Albion for over half a century.

==Biography==

===Playing career===
Born in West Bromwich, the eldest of a coal merchant&#x27;s six children, at only , Bassett was initially considered too frail for a professional player. Establishing himself as a winger in various local amateur sides, he joined West Bromwich Albion in 1886, playing outside-right. Bassett made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a winger for West Bromwich Albion in a 2–0 win against Stoke at the Victoria Ground. Bassett scored his debut League goal on 15 September 1888 at the County Ground, against Derby County. West Bromwich Albion won the match 2–1. He missed one of the &quot;Throstles&quot;&#x27; 22 Football League matches and scored 11 goals in season 1888–89 and was part of a midfield that achieved a big (three goals or more) League win on two separate occasions. His 11 league goals included one brace. When he made his League debut he was 19 years 225 days old; that made him, on that first day of League football, West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s youngest player. He played 261 Football League games for the club, scoring 61 goals, and he also won 16 England caps and scored 8 goals, becoming one of the game&#x27;s earliest celebrities. On 28 April 1894, Bassett became the first ever Albion player to be sent off: he was dismissed for using &quot;unparliamentary language&quot; in a friendly match away at Millwall. Described by one source as quick, direct and highly effective, he possessed superb ball-control and could score goals as well as make them. Bassett made his 311th and final competitive appearance for Albion on the last day of the 1898–99 season, lining up in a 7–1 defeat away against Aston Villa.

===Director and chairman===

Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players&#x27; summer wages from his own pocket. He remained Albion&#x27;s chair until his death.

His activities in the wider footballing world let him to take an active role in the development of both the Football Association and the Football League. The strength of England&#x27;s rivalry with Scotland had led Bassett to develop a &quot;distaste&quot; for Scots during his playing days, and throughout his 29-year chairmanship Albion did not sign a single Scottish player.

===Death and legacy===
Billy Bassett died in West Bromwich on 8 April 1937 at the age of 68. Two days after his death, a minute silence was held prior to Albion&#x27;s 4–1 defeat to Preston North End in the FA Cup semi-final at Highbury. The Albion players were clearly affected, with Teddy Sandford saying:

More than 100,000 people lined the streets of West Bromwich for Bassett&#x27;s funeral procession.

In 1998, he was listed among the Football League 100 Legends, while in 2004 he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations.

<text>&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; is a song by Bob Dylan that originally appeared on his fourth album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, which was released in 1964 by Columbia Records. According to music critic Oliver Trager, this song, along with others on the album, marked a departure for Dylan as he began to explore the possibilities of language and deeper levels of the human experience. Within a year of its release, the song was picked up as a single by folk rock act the Turtles and country artist Johnny Cash (who sang it as a duet with his future wife June Carter). Jan &amp; Dean also covered the track on their &quot;Folk &#x27;n Roll&quot; LP in 1965.

==Influences==
Dylan&#x27;s biographers generally agree that the song owes its inspiration to his former girlfriend Suze Rotolo. He reportedly began writing the song during his visit to Italy in 1963 while searching for Rotolo, who was studying there.

Clinton Heylin reports that a &quot;Times&quot; reporter at a May 1964 Royal Festival Hall concert where Dylan first played &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me&quot; took the chorus &quot;no, no, no&quot; as a parody of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; in &quot;She Loves You&quot;.

Nat Hentoff&#x27;s late October 1964 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article on Dylan includes an account of Hentoff&#x27;s presence on the evening in June 1964 in the CBS recording studio when Dylan recorded this and a dozen or so other songs. After some description of the recording studio and booth exchanges among Dylan, his friends, and the session&#x27;s producers, Hentoff describes the moment. &quot;Dylan,&quot; Hentoff writes, &quot;went on to record a song about a man leaving a girl because he was not prepared to be the kind of invincible hero and all-encompassing provider she wanted.&quot; &quot;&#x27;It ain&#x27;t me you&#x27;re looking for babe,&#x27; he [Dylan] sang, with finality,&quot; Hentoff writes in his piece.

The melody in both phrases uses a scale descending through a minor third. (Dylan played at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, May 17, 1964. The &quot;Times&quot; reviewed the performance in the following day&#x27;s edition under the heading of &quot;A Minnesota Minstrel.&quot; However, the review makes no mention of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe.&quot;)

==Notable renditions==

=== Covers ===
* Dylan and Johnny Cash were admirers of each other&#x27;s work. Cash recorded the song with June Carter. The song was released on Cash&#x27;s 1965 album, &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, and became a hit. This song was also featured in the 2005 film about Cash&#x27;s life, &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, and was performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.
* &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; was among many Dylan songs recorded by Joan Baez in the early years of her career. Baez&#x27;s version appeared on her 1964 album &quot;Joan Baez/5&quot;, which also included &quot;Go &#x27;Way from My Window&quot;. Additionally, Baez&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Live in Japan&quot; contains the song. Dylan and Baez sang a duet of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; at the Newport Folk Festival on July 24, 1964, as can be seen in the 2007 documentary film &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;, and their October 31, 1964 performance of it may be heard on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall&quot;, released in 2004.
* Kesha covered the song during the 2016 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.
===The Turtles version===
==== Background and recording ====
By summer 1965, the members of Los Angeles-based surf rock band the Crossfires had graduated high school and were on the brink of breaking up in the face of their future careers. In that period, the band had switched their sound towards a folk-inspired one, partly because it was more commercially viable for the times and partly because the members revered &quot;Dylan like a God&quot;. During the early summer of 1965, Ted Feigin and Lee Lasseff formed independent record label White Whale Records, who aimed &quot;to release as few records as possible&quot; and only recordings in artists &quot;they believed in&quot;. Disc jockey Red Foster saw the Crossfires perform at the Revelaire Club in Los Angeles, and promptly contacted Feigin and Lasseff, who signed to the label. They promptly re-christened the band&#x27;s name to the Beatlesque name the Turtles and urged them to record something folk rock-influenced. &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; was suggested by the Turtles lead vocalist Howard Kaylan&quot;. Additionally he also stated that Dylan saw the members of the band perform the song at the Revelaire Club and warmly gave them an enthusiastic response, urging them to record &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; as &quot;their [debut] single&quot;.

The Turtles&#x27; rendition of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; derives heavily from the sound of the contemporary rock band the Byrds (who had also recorded Dylan songs) and was recorded in a folk rock arrangement in contrast to Dylan&#x27;s original folk version. The band&#x27;s recording features both twelve-string guitar and tambourine, characteristic of the folk rock genre. According to Turtles&#x27; lead vocalist Howard Kaylan, their recording of the song had been inspired by the Zombies, as he enjoyed the way &quot;they did a soft and mysterious verse&quot; that led into a quadruple () &quot;chorus that really kicked ass&quot;. By June 1965, White Whale had booked recording time at the Western Recorders studio in Hollywood, Los Angeles, which came to be the Turtles&#x27; first recording session under that name. In addition to &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot;, the Kaylan-penned songs &quot;Almost There&quot; and &quot;Wanderin&#x27; Kind&quot; were also recorded at the session. As White Whale was a fledging record label, they were not able to afford session musicians and thus the members of the Turtles&#x27; perform on the single. The session was produced by Bones Howe, who would come to produce the majority of the Turtles&#x27; early recordings.

==== Release and reception ====
White Whale released &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; as both the Turtles&#x27; and the record label&#x27;s debut single in the US during July 1965. This followed shortly by the release of the single in Canada by Mercury Records in August 1965, and in the UK on Pye Records in September 1965. According to Kaylan, this made them label-mates with the Kinks and that it was &quot;thrilling to have their songs released globablly&quot;. The B-side of the single was the Kaylan-penned &quot;Almost There&quot;, which band member Mark Volman stated was almost a &quot;parody of the Kinks&quot;.

&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on August 7, 1965 before peaking in the top-10 at number eight on September 18. It would spend a further 11 weeks on the charts. In the other US music trade publications &quot;Record World&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; it fared similarly well, peaking at number 7 and 8 respectively. Outside of the US, the single fared the best in Canada, where it reached number three on the &quot;RPM&quot; chart, and Sweden, where it peaked at number five of the &quot;Tio i Topp&quot; chart on October 29, 1965. According to Kaylan, this national success came so fast that &quot;they did not know what hit them&quot;, adding that the band first heard the song on the radio after which they &quot;screamed and hugged and lost their minds&quot;. In September 1965, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me&quot; became the title track of the Turtles&#x27; debut album of the same name, and it has since been featured on most of the band&#x27;s compilation albums, including &quot;Golden Hits&quot; in October 1967.

Based on the Turtles&#x27; arrangement, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; became a folk rock standard in Los Angeles, producing covers by the likes of Nancy Sinatra, Jan and Dean and Dino, Desi &amp; Billy. Reception of the song has generally been positive, with AllMusic critic Joseph McCombs stating it to be part of the Turtles&#x27; &quot;important bases&quot;. On the contrary, Steve Leggett believes the Turtles&#x27; to have sounded like a &quot;second-tier version of the Byrds&quot; following the release of the single, as does Gracie Williams who stated that the band turned into a &quot;glorified cover band&quot; with the single release. Jim Beviglia of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; wrote that the band pulled off a &quot;nice dynamic&quot; between the contrasting verses and chorus. Kaylan has retrospectively stated that the Turtles turned &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; from a song about regret to a song expressing anger.

<text>Danielle &quot;Dani&quot; Moonstar (also known as Psyche, Mirage, and Moonstar) is a Northern Cheyenne superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She first appeared in the graphic novel &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (Sept. 1982), created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod. The character is usually depicted as associated with the New Mutants, but has also served as a member of the Valkyries of Asgard.

A mutant, Moonstar originally possessed the psionic/psychic ability to telepathically create illusions of her opponents&#x27; fears or wishes. She later developed a wide range of psionic and energy manipulation powers, and gained magical abilities after a series of adventures in Asgard. She was a member of the New Mutants and, after a long absence, its reincarnation as X-Force. She was also a member of the X-Men, Young X-Men and the Fearless Defenders. She was depowered after Decimation, but later regained her powers after being infected with, then cured of Warlock&#x27;s transmode virus by Dark Beast. She then went on to resume her duties as a Valkyrie after making a deal with Hela.

Blu Hunt portrayed Danielle Moonstar in the 2020 film &quot;The New Mutants&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Danielle Moonstar is a teenage Native American (specifically, Cheyenne), and was born in Boulder, Colorado. As with most mutants, Dani&#x27;s mutant powers manifested during puberty. One of her first manifestations is a vision of her parents&#x27; death, killed by a demonic bear. Shortly afterwards, her parents disappear and Dani is taken in by her grandfather, Black Eagle. The Hellfire Club attempt to capture her, and in the melee, her grandfather is killed. He had already contacted Professor X to take care of Dani. Xavier, who had been a close friend of Moonstar&#x27;s father, offers to teach Dani control over her powers. She joins his group of students called the New Mutants, and shortly afterwards becomes the co-leader of the group, together with Cannonball. There, she develops a deep friendship with Wolfsbane.

===&quot;The New Mutants&quot;===
While with the New Mutants, Moonstar starts to have nightmares again about the Demon Bear, who until then had been kept from her due to Black Eagle&#x27;s protective spells. Her fear over the entity causes her to contemplate suicide. One night, she attacks the entity and is taken to the hospital. The other New Mutants wait for her in the hospital and are tracked down by the Bear. Its magics affect the team, drawing them into another dimension. The New Mutant Magik pierces the Demon Bear with her magical sword, and it reverts to its original form: William and Peg Lonestar. Dani is reunited with her parents, but decides to stay at Xavier&#x27;s school. They develop an intense rivalry with the Hellions, a super-powered team of young mutants led by the White Queen. This rivalry is later somewhat cooled when Danielle bonds with the Hellions&#x27;s leader, Thunderbird.

While stranded in the Asgardian realm, Danielle finds a winged horse trapped in mud and barbed wire. She frees the animal and names it Brightwind, not realizing the creature&#x27;s nature. Selected by Brightwind as her rider, Danielle inadvertently becomes a Valkyrie. This allows Danielle to see premonitions of death.

The Power Pack call the New Mutants to help against a group of demonic creatures. The Pack&#x27;s mother is gravely ill and Danielle fights off Death outside her hospital window, gaining the mother a new lease on life. Later, on a trip back home to see her parents, she encounters an old childhood friend. This friend has become racist and mentally ill during the time she was gone. He was also a diabetic and when he fails to take his medicine, he crashes and dies.

She and the other New Mutants attempt to save former teammate Magma from the High Evolutionary. During the fight, Moonstar is thrown into a machine intended to strip mutants of their powers. Instead, the machine (which had been reset by two other victims of the Evolutionary&#x27;s plan) enhances her mutation; it gives her the ability to make the telepathic images manifest in reality. This ability is limited only in that Danielle can only sustain one wish or fear at a time. As a technique for dispelling previous manifestations, she takes up the habit of summoning a spear.

For a time, the team is taken care of by X-Factor. The group is seemingly settled into Ship, a sentient flying headquarters. Danielle gets worse and worse headaches, which causes concern with the team but all this is interrupted by many things, including X-Factor being drawn away in battle.

Hela, the death goddess of Asgard, creates a plan to take over the realm and kill the Allfather Odin, who is in a healing sleep at the time. Hela&#x27;s magic drives Danielle mad and she has to be restrained by her friends, allies, and the unseen help of Doctor Strange. The battle is soon moved to Asgard. The New Mutants, along with the wolf-prince Hrimhari and the Valkyrie Krista (aka Mist), who resist Hela, ultimately triumph. Danielle seemingly loses her winged horse Brightwind in the battle, which concludes in Odin&#x27;s very bedroom.

Faced with a difficult choice, she chooses to stay behind in Asgard and fully assume the responsibility of being a Valkyrie. This angers Hotamitanio, one of her Cheyenne deities, who comes to Asgard itself to bring her back. Danielle ultimately persuades him to leave her to her own devices by promising that one day, she will return to her tribe.

===&quot;X-Force&quot;===
When she does return, she joins S.H.I.E.L.D., unbeknownst to her former friends in X-Force, and infiltrates the Mutant Liberation Front. At this point, she refines her psychic ability so that she could cast &quot;psychic arrows&quot;, which incapacitate their targets, and rides Darkwind, a dark version of her former steed Brightwind. Her assignment brings her into many conflicts with old allies, mostly X-Force (a continuation of her old team the New Mutants), but also Excalibur and Moira MacTaggert. Despite the Front&#x27;s malicious motives, Dani secretly works against them, working with Cable to turn Feral over to law enforcement authorities for past crimes, sabotaging a mission in China, and harboring a resentment towards members of the Front, aside from Forearm, with whom she develops a genuine friendship. Her Asgardian white winged steed, Brightwind (who later became the black bat-winged Darkwind when Danielle was stripped of Valkyrie abilities), was killed by Reignfire.

Later, she seeks X-Force&#x27;s help with a foray into Asgard to help stamp out a take-over attempt by the dark elf Malekith. When most of the MLF is apprehended during , Dani is able to extricate herself with X-Force&#x27;s aid. She joins X-Force for an extensive road-trip. After an encounter with the mysterious Arcadia Deville, she gains the ability to manipulate quantum energy for a short time, but this power disappears shortly thereafter. She leaves X-Force when they contact Pete Wisdom and take on a more proactive direction.

===New X-Men===

After a short time as a part-time member of the X-Men, Moonstar becomes the mentor of a new New Mutants squad at the Xavier Institute (and the legal guardian of Elixir), as well as the institute&#x27;s American History teacher. During this time she enjoys a reunion with Karma and then later, Wolfsbane. She helps Wolfsbane deal with the traumatic return of her lycanthropic powers, but an ill-thought romantic liaison between Wolfsbane and Elixir drives a deep wedge between the two women.

During her appearances in &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 2 and &quot;New X-Men&quot; vol. 2 the bulk of Danielle&#x27;s powers appear to have reverted to their original form. She still retains some of her Valkyrie abilities, namely the ability to sense the dead, but they are not as strong as they once were.

===The Initiative===
In the wake of the House of M crossover, the Scarlet Witch causes many mutants to lose their powers. Moonstar is one of the many who lose their powers, and is fired by Emma Frost who feels that as a human, she is no longer safe nor has any right to remain at the school. She briefly reappears in &quot;Generation M&quot; #5, in which she revealed she has not dreamt since M-Day.

Following the events of the superhuman Civil War, Dani is recruited by the Initiative program to serve as an instructor to the next generation of superheroes, alongside her former colleague Beast. She is the person brought in to train Trauma in the use of powers, which like hers, are fear based. He does transform into the shape of the &#x27;Demon Bear&#x27; but Dani is not fazed and talks Trauma into a calmer state. However, due to her belief that Trauma could and should use his powers in a therapeutic nature, Henry Peter Gyrich, who intends to use Trauma as a weapon for the Initiative, is quick to dismiss her from Camp Hammond once she provides Trauma with enough training in his powers.

===Young X-Men===
Danielle later becomes a member of the latest incarnation of the Hellfire Club brought together by Sunspot. Blindfold and Ink, deceived by Donald Pierce in the guise of Cyclops, are put in charge of capturing her. Ink betrays Blindfold and knocks her out and delivers both of them to Donald Pierce. After the Young X-Men defeat Pierce, Danielle moves to San Francisco along with the rest of the X-Men and is told by Cyclops that she and Sunspot will train the Young X-Men. She persuades an apprehensive Anole to join the Young X-Men and move to San Francisco.

===Reforming the New Mutants===

After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and Karma are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission Magik, having teleported off into the future after the events of &quot;X-Infernus&quot;, reappears at the X-Men&#x27;s base in San Francisco. Magik informs Cannonball and Sunspot that Karma and Dani are going to die soon, prompting Cannonball to assemble a team consisting of himself, Sunspot, Magma and Magik to rescue the pair. Cannonball and Sunspot come across a tied up and unconscious Karma in the back of a bar after a brief search, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing Legion from a box. The personalities in Legion&#x27;s mind want to kill Dani because she can help Legion get those personalities under control. Legion uses mental projection to try to kill Dani, but she is saved at the last second. Dani punches Cannonball for his willingness to leave her behind because she lacks powers; she acquires guns to pursue Legion. Again, Cannonball tries to drive her away, saying guns won&#x27;t help. Despite Dani defeating Legion, he maintains this attitude and she leaves.

===Utopia===
Moonstar also assists Cyclops as he prepares his strategy against Norman Osborn&#x27;s forces. Cyclops sends her to Las Vegas where she approaches Hela for a . Hela warns her that the price of the boon is a heavy one, but Dani accepts, requesting &quot;a new ride home and a big ol&#x27; sword.&quot; Later she arrives for the final battle wearing full Valkyrie armor and with her powers fully restored. She faces Ares, defeating him after a brutal battle.

In the aftermath of Utopia, Dani, having relinquished her Valkyrie abilities, is grooming the newly resurrected Brightwind when Cyclops approaches her, congratulates her on her battle with Ares, and asks her to resume her previous teaching position with the X-Men. Dani is more interested in joining Cannonball&#x27;s team, but is informed by Cyclops that Cannonbal submitted a request for a permanent roster and didn&#x27;t include Dani. Dani challenges Cannonball to a duel in the Danger Room and the two come to an understanding during their battle; Cannonball then allows Dani to rejoin his team and vows to treat her as an equal. Dani became romantically involved with Cannonball, and after he resigned from the position of leader of the New Mutants, Dani took his place.

===Entanglements in Asgard, Limbo and Age of X===
Hela summons Dani and calls in her favor: to gather the spirits of the Asgardians that fell in battle with Norman Osborn&#x27;s forces. This time, due to the specific nature of her task, her sword cannot touch Asgardian living flesh, but instead proves deadly against the Disir, who have come to feast on the spirits while they are helpless.

She and the other New Mutants squad were also captured by Project Purgatory and faced the Inferno Babies, aged and superpowered versions of the infants captured during the original Inferno event. During the ordeal, Dani was beaten and tortured but managed to extricate herself from captivity as the New Mutants turned the tables on their captors.

During Legion&#x27;s pocket reality, Age of X, Dani played a significant role as a tracker and leader of the Moonstar Cadre, a team of elite hunters and enforcers, including Cypher, Karma, Magma, Sunspot and Dust.

===Unfinished Business===

Due to the events in Limbo and Age of X, the New Mutants lost several members: Cannonball, Karma and Magik. Cyclops then tasked Dani and her team of tying up loose ends, including rescuing Nate Grey, who became her new love interest, subduing the Sugar Man, taming the alien chaos of the metal band, Diskhorde, encountering a virus on Ani-Mator&#x27;s island, revisiting the Disir issue in Asgard and eliminating the threat of the Truefriend, a techno-organic infected future version of Cypher.

===Fearless Defenders and All-New, All-Different Marvel===

Dani would next join Brunnhilde&#x27;s team of earth Valkyries called the Fearless Defenders to combat the machinations of Caroline Le Fay, after which she remained a supporting character for the X-Men. She would use her Valkyrie death sense to locate those suffering from the M-Pox, notably rescuing Lady Mastermind from succumbing to the disease.

===ResurreXtion and beyond===
Dani would continue her affiliation with her mutant pals for some time after the M-Pox crisis. Such as attending the (faux) funeral for her deceased friend and fellow New Mutant; Sunspot. Serving as a teacher and guide for Jubilee&#x27;s class of sidelined Xavier students. Striving through the onslaught of a Hydra affiliated alt. Captain America&#x27;s takeover of the world during his Secret Empire.

Continuing her mentorship duties at the institute while many of its senior staff were battling against the resurrected Omega Red. Moonstar and many of the students ended up contracted into the insane scheming of Mojo as he had turned all New York into a lethal televised simulacrum channel surf. She would be featured at the aborted wedding of Katherine Pryde and Piotr Rasputin as the bride left the groom at the altar. Danielle was also present at the recent resurrection of one of the founding O5 X-Men, Jean Grey as she was resurrected by her link to the Phoenix Force in her old home of Annandale on Hudson.

Mirage would succumb to a techno-organic virus infection by her late technarchy friend Warlock which would spread to and infect the rest of the New Mutants team gathered by the soul cleaved Karma, who had sent her to investigate his recent resurgence in Canterbury, Connecticut.

It was later revealed that she was contracted by the latter to help find the soul of her brother after he&#x27;d split off from her, but ended up infected and becoming Moonlock; creating duplicates of their old friends using his powers to attack the originals with. Eventually Karma sold all of her T.O. infected teammates to the Office of National Emergency&#x27;s corrupt mutant hating C.O. Robert Callahan before being infected by a lock infected Illyana. Where they&#x27;ve remained in captivity ever since. During her imprisonment, Dani and the other Lock infested New Mutants were pushed into the service of director Callahan as cyber-organic mutant hunter-killers. First sending them after Emma Frost after having remade them into techno-organic sentinels in his service.

She along with all their old friends would later be freed from the office by remnants of the X-Men after their climactic battle with a recently repowered Nathaniel Grey, the mutant messiah known as X-Man, resulting in the deaths of their entire team.

===X-Men Disassembled===
After their rescue from O*N*E organization, Scott Summers began compiling a list of potential targets to be taken care of in the wake of the X-Men&#x27;s demise and mutant xenophobia cranking up to genocidal degrees. Using this opportunity to settle up before retiring as X-Men, they would re-encounter Multiple Man within an underground experimentation facility while on the hunt for Dark Beast.

Next on the list, she and others of the New Mutants would hunt for members of the Marauders while others would investigate another mass mutant slaughter. Running into Pantu Hurageb A.K.A. Reaper while Jamie and his dupes shook him down for information as he tried to resist; Dani, Magik and Wolfsbane eventually incapacitating him when he&#x27;d managed to make a break for it. She and the rest of the X-Men would go in search for more leads running into Scrambler as he was fleeing Callisto after he and his crew had led another Morlock Massacre.

While Scott and the others went out to deal with the Mutant Liberation Front, spearheaded by Hope Summers and Banshee, Dark Beast managed to cure the T.O infested within many of the New Mutants as an experiment by siphoning it into one of Madrox&#x27;s clones.

Afterward, they would do battle with a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Joseph who had been masquerading as Magneto while committing acts of anti-human terrorism. He would soon be unceremoniously killed by Kwannon to keep him from falling into the government&#x27;s hands, in that instant however Danielle&#x27;s psionic rapport with Wolfsbane kicked in; notifying the rest of the team that her partner and best friend had died.

She and others who had attended Rahne&#x27;s funeral gave a beautiful eulogy for their fallen sister, after the sermon Cain Marko voiced concerns as to why it was Cyclops never listed Emma Frost as a potential target.

Having finally found the Marauders, the X-Men team immediately went into battle with them. Afterward, the evil mutants admit that they had nothing to do with the murders in the Morlock Tunnels, after Chamber summarily executes them in cold blood and in turn is cut down by Harpoon with his last breath. Illyana teleported the X-team back to their home base only find it in flames. Once they make it outside they find Mister Sinister was responsible for their current predicament, setting their secret lounge ablaze in anger for the X-Men killing his Marauders. After a hard-fought conflict, Essex just nonchalantly gives up the fight; wherein the X-Men relocate to another safe haven in Manhattan. The construction of which being ordered by Karma&#x27;s company as a means to apologize to the team before leaving.

Something Karma spoke to her confidante about in private. Danielle was little more than distraught to hear such news but after her friends voiced her reasons, as well as her guilt for what she&#x27;d done. Next on the list were the Upstarts, a team of mutant killing thrill-seekers amongst whom many were long since dead. Having tracked them to the Cloisters in Washington Heights, the rival outfits would engage in furious combat. Even in defeat Shinobi Shaw would not go in the night quietly, committing suicide rather than be incarcerated by phasing then solidifying his hand into his face. Moonstar and the others soon reconvene within Dark Beasts lab, where he regales them on how he found a way to neutralize the new x-gene vaccine used to kill future generations of Homo Superior. But was horrified to find out that, with Sinister&#x27;s help, his airborne antitoxin procedure had the added effect of triggering a tug-of-war between their latent mutation and the cure making their X-gene&#x27;s activate.. Causing those who take the governments hate crime medicine to fall into a coma as a result. After such a revelation, Magik all but lost her patience and warped the mad scientist into the ceiling of his lab, killing him instantly.

After getting a psychic message from Ms. Frost requesting their assistance. They&#x27;re notified of how she&#x27;d been manipulating them from behind the scenes to serve the whims of the anti-mutant O*N*E agenda, but in truth was playing everyone to her own accord for a personal as well as wholesome benefit for all mutants. While part of their remaining team were out retrieving their comrade Wolverine from the office, they lost more of their own but were successful in bringing back those they needed. Moonstar and the rest protected Warlox (the amalgamation of Warlock and a Madrox dupe), Nemesis and Fabian Cortez as they transported him to the Black King&#x27;s mansion while dodging more O*N*E troops as they cracked down on the last few X-Men left alive.
Reconnoitering with Scott and his scout team, Dani was dismayed to hear that Cyclops lost more people while failing in their primary mission to rescue Elixir. Nonetheless, Emma was able to do what she&#x27;d set out to do when she made contact with the uncanny mutants. Erasing the very memory of mutation and those who possess powers because of it from the minds of every person on the planet.

After the mass mind alteration, Danielle has a chat with Scott about the people they&#x27;d lost and all friends and family they left behind. Scott was insulted to think that Dani believed their cohabitation for survival was really just carefully arranged stepping stones used to enable the more important members of the mutant nation to shelter their own survival. Emma&#x27;s plan wasn&#x27;t perfect, however, as Director Callahan had set up fail-safes in place as he knew the dangers of working with Emma Frost. Danielle was angry to find more Techno-Organic Sentinels attacking the Hellfire mansion but offers her aid nonetheless. Even with Warlox alternating their programming and Wolverine cutting down the duplicitous Callahan in brutal fashion, the T.O Sentinels still rampage long after his command apparatus dies with him. Despite the dire nature of the situation, however, previously thought dead X-Men come out of nowhere and dispatch the Sentinel Squad. The two sides exchange notes while Scott inquires to Dani about how and if she knew whether these X-Men were dead, while Moonstar herself admits she knew nothing of this. She knew they would all be reunited one day, like they hopefully will be with those whom they lost throughout recent hardships.

The X-Men debate whether or not they should keep to the new status quo of mutants being invisible to the eyes of the world. Many of which, Dani included, are not happy about the idea of hiding who they are from a planet of ungrateful people that constantly make light of all the suffering and loss they have endured for so long. Despite knowing the obvious truth that by making themselves known again will mean humanity will continue to assail them at every turn, they all agree on it and destroy the Cerebro unit used to mindwipe their existence from the world, revealing themselves to all who fear and hate them once again.

=== War of the Realms ===
As the X-Men were fighting against Nanny and Orphan-Maker, Danielle suddenly received the call to arms when the Valkyries of Odin were called to stand against Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s forces as he brought his war that torched the realms of the World Tree to Midgard. Without warning she had Illyana teleport her to where the fighting had begun while the others were preoccupied with the Nanny and Orphan-Maker, while the X-Men follow behind as Magik teleports them to New York City after its fall in search of their teammates.

Dani makes a reappearance in her Valkyrie guise while dispatching some of Malekith&#x27;s hordes. She explains how when the dark elf king declared war on the Earth, Danielle as an honorary shield maiden, was called to arms by their All-Father to intercept them. But the Valkryor were all killed in the attack, and now Dani is all that is left of the once mighty slain choosers of Asgard.

For the next couple of months, Danielle and the X-Men would remain in the ruined city of Flushing, Queens helping any survivors escape the horrors of the Nine Worlds. She was aided by Karma, Madrox, Banshee and Hope in dispatching frost giants while Havok and Cyclops dealt with larger hunting parties following close behind. After tending to what is left of a roving band of lingering humans, the X-Men move out to offer aid to the rest of the team they got separated from in the initial incursion. There they find Hope and the others now backed bySunspot whom they found in the underground sewer system, all present however are shocked to find they are missing members of their parties. While searching for their missing friends, Danielle is able to track their location by signifying Sabretooth&#x27;s involvement. They are soon met by more of Malekith&#x27;s forces who were warded off by the arrival of Hrimhari, bringing with him his family and their familial friend Illyana back to the mutant&#x27;s care.

Not long after, Sabretooth&#x27;s invading forces beset the human haven of Syndergaard intent on getting Magik back and slaughtering everyone within the refuge. Sunspot implores Magik to warp everyone to safety but retorts she cannot due to Amora&#x27;s hex.

With the sacrifice of Sunspot by destroying a cursed relic inhibiting Magik&#x27;s powers, the X-Men were able to use her portals as effective misdirection against the enemy forces. Mirage and Karma combine abilities to throw up a convincing illusion to trick them all into Limbo using Madrox&#x27;s duplicates and the clothes of weary survivors they are taking care of. Wolfsbane and Magik dispatch Sabretooth with lethal haste but at the cost of sending her lover and young son back to Hel as they broke the deal made with the Enchantress to live again. Danielle decided to pay last rites to her fallen sisters and her brother as their spirits come to urge her to live on.

As Malekith&#x27;s war began dying down with the return of Mjolnir to Thor&#x27;s hand, Mirage was there with Earth&#x27;s Mightiest as the fallen god Loki used Heimdall&#x27;s sword to cut his way out of Laufey&#x27;s greedy gut, ending the frost giant king&#x27;s life.

==Powers and abilities==
===Mutant powers===
Mirage is a mutant with empathic psi abilities to communicate with animals and people, as well as create three-dimensional images of visual concepts from within the minds of herself and others. Her most developed ability allowed her to manifest people&#x27;s fears or desires as realistic illusions. Because of the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s powers and actions, Moonstar lost her mutant abilities for a time, but regained her powers after being infected with, then cured of Warlock&#x27;s transmode virus by Dark Beast.

Her ability began as manifesting people&#x27;s worst nightmares, many times in an uncontrollable fashion, against the will of both involved. Soon she gained the ability to control this and to alternatively manifest a person&#x27;s &quot;deepest desire&quot;, mainly as something or someone the affected person respects. She can also project images of objects of fear or desire from the minds of vertebrate animals and certain insects, but only the animal from which she derives the image will be able to see it.

She can even create illusions by channeling residual thought and emotional impressions in an area (such as showing Wolverine a battle scene between Mister Sinister and unknown assailants, simply by entering the area where the battle had recently taken place). At first, Mirage could not control her image projecting powers and would draw and project images without consciously willing to do so. She has since gained control through training and maturity.

Mirage has a quasi-telepathic talent that allows her to form a rapport with various fauna, including her winged horse, Brightwind, primates, canines, lupines, felines, and avians. She can sense their feelings, consciously perceive images in their minds, and even see through their eyes. This enables her to communicate with Wolfsbane in her transitional half-lupine form or transformed into her full wolf form. She has also been able to exist peacefully with wild animals.

She had, for a time, the ability to make the telepathic images manifest as psionic energy, becoming tangible entities of solid psionic force. This ability was limited in that Mirage could only sustain one illusion at a time. She often carried around a &quot;dream spear&quot;, to destroy previous illusions. Many times, her powers caused her to experience sharp, blinding headaches. She can temporarily regain the ability for tangible 3-D mirage casting in strengthened capacity while in the domain of Otherworld.

Mirage has displayed the ability to focus her psionic powers into energy arrows which could stun an opponent by disrupting their central nervous system, or force them to relive a traumatic memory. In later publishing Moonstar&#x27;s psi arrows have a more physical aspect to them. Able to draw blood from those stuck with them, it is currently unknown if this is an effect of her latent materialization abilities or not.

Although not a traditional telepath, her mental abilities give her sufficient control to have used Cerebro at a time it was only usable by telepaths, and she has also exhibited a danger sense.

===Valkyrie abilities===
When Mirage rescued Brightwind, she became a valkyrie, and became endowed with the Valkyrie power to perceive and sense the coming of Death. As such, Mirage could perceive a &quot;deathglow&quot; surrounding a person in serious danger of dying, a dark cloud or graphic visual image over people who were in mortal peril. She could also perceive Death incarnate and even do physical battle with Death itself to stave off mortality for a short time. She has created an illusory &quot;Cheyenne ghost-staff&quot; drawing upon an image in her own mind and has successfully wielded it as a weapon against Death and Hela.

She initially lost these powers due to the fall of Asgard but has since regained them after making a deal with Hela.

Moonstar appears to have gained a substantial degree of superhuman strength from Hela as she was able to knock Ares off his feet. Additionally, she wields a powerful supernatural sword able to discharge energy, bleed skyfather class divine, capable of slaying spiritual entities and cuts through curses/enchantments. Matt Fraction has confirmed that since Danielle&#x27;s restored Valkyrie powers come directly from Hela herself, they are much greater than they were previously, referring to her as a &quot;Valkyrie Plus&quot;. It has been mentioned that she was specifically designed to take down a god. New Mutants writer Zeb Wells has confirmed that her recent power boost was temporary and that she is depowered again. She still owes her services to Hela as a Valkyrie and as such, Brightwind remained with Danielle as a reminder of this pact. Danielle still possesses her Valkyrie powers, they used to only activate when Hela herself wills them to do so. The abilities also seem to come on and off again whenever she is around the dead. But over time learned to call on them at will again without her consent.

===Physical abilities===
Due to her training at Xavier&#x27;s and her time as a Valkyrie in Asgard, and her natural athleticism growing up in the Rocky Mountains, Dani is physically fit and an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. In addition, she is experienced in the use of several simple weapons, especially the bow and arrow, spear, knife and sword, which she carried as a Valkyrie. She is a skilled equestrian and swimmer, a good marksman with a rifle, and an excellent archer.

===Former abilities===
For a brief period of time, Danielle Moonstar&#x27;s powers were bolstered by Arcadia Deville in odd yet phenomenal ways. She could tap into the primal mainstream of the universe to channel quantum energy through her natural mutant power, as well as make use of them in other dis-separate ways. Such as emitting force blasts potent enough to cripple powerful demons, heal and mend with a glancing touch, resist the physiological and psychological invasion by the techno-organic mutant Paradigm, see into broader energy spectrum beyond light and energy at a quantum level and cause a transmogrification effect on the surrounding area at a subatomic level, sense disturbances in energy fields from miles out as well as alternate them to cancel out and sync with alternate energy forms such as Electromagnetic Waves, even possessing an undisclosed capacity to manipulate reality on a quantum level.

<text>Haskell Indian Nations University is a public tribal land-grant university in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. Founded in 1884 as a residential boarding school for Native American children, the school has developed into a university operated by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs that offers both associate and baccalaureate degrees. The college was founded to serve members of federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States. It is the oldest continually operating federal school for American Indians.

Approximately 140 Tribal nations and Alaska Native communities are represented at Haskell, which is funded directly by the Bureau of Indian Education as a U.S. Trust Responsibility to Native American Tribes. While the school does not charge tuition, students are responsible for paying yearly fees.

Twelve campus buildings have been designated as U.S. National Historic Landmarks. Haskell is home to the Haskell Cultural Center and Museum, the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame, the &quot;Indian Leader&quot;, the oldest Native American student newspaper in the country; and numerous student clubs and organizations. Faculty and students built the Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork in 1992, and the Haskell-Baker Wetlands are important for migrating birds. The renowned Rinehart Collection is housed in the Haskell Cultural Center. Numerous sculptures and murals are located throughout the campus. Haskell also is a member of the American Council on Education, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, the Higher Learning Commission, and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.

The university hosts cultural and academic events that attract visitors (both Native American and non-Native) from across the country and abroad. Such events include the annual Haskell Indian Art Market, the Stories-n-Motion Film Festival, and the Haskell Commencement and Pow-Wow. These public events are held along with numerous educational conferences, workshops, and presentations.

==History==
The history of Haskell Indian Nations University reflects both U.S. Indian policy and self-determination efforts by American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Haskell was founded during an era following the Indian Wars when the federal government believed that Native Americans needed to assimilate into the majority culture in order to survive. The US government had earlier provided some schools on reservations according to treaties, which were usually administered by religious missions. In the late 19th century, it also began to establish off-reservation boarding schools. Native American children were recruited from a variety of tribes to attend for their education, and were expected to abandon their tribal traditions while there. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School, founded in 1879 in Pennsylvania, became the model for federal immersion programs in education. In 1882 the United States Congress authorized three new boarding schools to be established in Nebraska, Kansas, and Indian Territory (a plan that would cost $150,000), and the Carlisle school was the model for these soon-to-be-constructed institutions, including what became Haskell in Kansas.

When Haskell opened in 1884, it was called United States Indian Industrial Training School. It had 22 elementary school-age students the first year. Soon boys were taught skills in tailoring, wagon making, blacksmithing, harness making, painting, shoe making, and farming, reflecting trades common to their mostly rural and small town environments of reservations. Girls studied cooking, sewing and homemaking. As was typical of many such rural schools, most of the students&#x27; food was produced on the associated Haskell farm. Older students were expected to work while at the school, as in the model of Tuskegee Institute and similar independent institutions.

According to many sources, school living conditions during the 1880s and 1890s were harsh. Organized under the semi-military system of the Carlisle Indian School, students wore uniforms to enforce conformity and end tribal identification. Their hair was cut when they entered school, which was especially painful for the boys, as in most tribes, adult men kept long hair. The children marched to classes and exercised regularly. Students were often physically punished if they failed to follow the rules of the institute. At least 103 children died while attending the school.
In 1887, the school was renamed as Haskell Institute in honor of Dudley Haskell, the U.S. representative from Kansas&#x27;s 2nd district who achieved having the school built in Lawrence.
In 1889 Charles T. Meserve was appointed as the fifth superintendent in Haskell&#x27;s five-year history. His discharge of many employees (including the principal teacher) brought criticism from the president of the National Education Association. Students reacted to his harsh treatment by sending four protesting petitions to the BIA in Washington, DC. A Special Indian Agent, appointed to investigate the incident, whitewashed the whole situation.

In the early 20th century, Haskell continued to evolve while operated by the federal government. It added classes for upper grades, and in 1927 received accreditation as a Kansas high school. By 1935 it was classified as a vocational-technical school.

From the 1900s through the 1930s, Haskell became famous for its football teams. In competition with teams from colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Brown, Haskell was known as the &quot;Powerhouse of the West&quot;. From 1902 to 1919, Haskell won five of 11 games played against the University of Texas. 

During the 1960s, Native Americans organized to assert their cultures and work to realign the relationships between federally recognized tribes and the federal government. Among the areas they wanted to change was education of their children. They wanted more from the schools. They were encouraged by the civil rights movement of African Americans to press for fulfillment of treaty conditions. At Haskell, students and activists wanted to reconfigure the school&#x27;s pedagogical approach to better serve Indian country and Alaska Native communities. In 1965, Haskell graduated its last high school class.

Two years later, with more curriculum development, the school in 1967 was renamed as Haskell Indian Junior College, able to award associate degrees and certificates in special skills programs. Wallace Galluzzi (1926–1984) was president of Haskell Indian Junior College (later Haskell Indian Nations University, previously Haskell Institute) in Lawrence, Kansas from 1969 to 1981. By the late 1980s, planning began to develop the institution as a four-year, bachelor-degree granting university.

In 1993, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Ada Deer, approved that development, which had been built on expansion of the curricula and programs. It was renamed as Haskell Indian Nations University. Haskell offered its first four-year baccalaureate degree program in elementary teacher education. Within a few years, Haskell had developed its own, specialized bachelor&#x27;s degree program in American Indian Studies; Business Administration and Environmental Sciences degree programs soon followed.

In 1994, Congress designated this college and 31 other tribal colleges as land-grant colleges, to provide them with benefits of related programs.

At the turn of the 21st century, Haskell had become a tribal-based university with a curriculum serving general Native American and Alaska Native goals. In 2013 it had about 1,000 students. Today, Haskell&#x27;s alumni work in numerous areas to serve Indian country and Alaska Native communities.

==Campus==


The Haskell campus has 12 buildings that have been designated as U.S. National Historic Landmarks. In addition to its historic architecture, Haskell is recognized for its collection of public sculptures, murals, photographs, and paintings. Examples include the well-known sculpture, &quot;Comrade in Mourning,&quot; by Allan Houser.

The Haskell-Baker Wetlands span approximately on the south side of the Haskell campus. These wetlands are home to 243 species of birds, 21 species of fish, 22 species of reptiles, and 26 species of plants. This area serves as a feeding and breeding ground for the migratory birds that breed in Canada and migrate to Mexico and South America. The Northern Crawfish Frog is an endangered species and its critical habitat is the wetlands.

===Blalock Hall===
Constructed in 1978, Blalock Hall was named in honor of Margaret Blalock, Chippewa,
a Haskell alumna, and long-time employee at the college, who was committed to serving the students at Haskell. It is a residential hall for freshman (first year) men and male students transferring from other colleges and universities.

===Hiawatha Hall===

Originally constructed in 1898 and dedicated on March 12, 1899, Hiawatha Hall was named after the historic Onondaga leader of the same name. The hall was built by the United Methodist Church to serve as a campus chapel (although it has also served as a general auditorium and as a girl&#x27;s gym at various times in the school&#x27;s history), and today it is the oldest building still standing on the Haskell campus. Hiawatha Hall is currently owned by the federal government and has been closed for decades because the government has not allocated money to pay for necessary repairsdespite the building being on the National Historic Landmarks list.

===Osceola and Keokuk Halls===
Osceola and Keokuk Halls are collectively known as &quot;O-K Hall.&quot; Constructed in 1884, Osceola and Keokuk served as dormitories for men and women, respectively. Osceola was a famous Seminole warrior, whose name means &quot;Rising Sun.&quot; Keokuk, a Sac and Fox whose name means &quot;Watchful Fox,&quot; was not a hereditary chief, but recognized for his skillful leadership, force of character, and brilliant oratory. O-K Hall is currently a residential hall for both women and men.

===Pocahontas Hall===
Pocahontas Hall was built in 1931 and was named after the daughter of Powhatan, paramount chief of the Powhatan confederacy. She married English colonist John Rolfe, and they were ancestors to many descendants of First Families of Virginia. It serves as a residential hall for freshman women and female students transferring from other colleges and universities.

===Pontiac Hall===
Built in 1934, Pontiac Hall was named after an Ottawa chief. It is located immediately south of the main quadrangle.

===Powhatan Hall===
Powhatan Hall was constructed in 1932 and named after the paramount chief of the Powhatan Confederacy, made up of 30 Algonquian-speaking tribes in coastal Virginia. Originally used for classrooms, it has been adapted as a residential hall, housing Student Residential Assistants (SRS).

===Roe Cloud Hall===
Completed in 1997, Roe Cloud Hall was named after Henry Roe Cloud, a member of the Winnebago Nation. He was the first American Indian superintendent of the Haskell Institute, serving from 1933 to 1935. Roe Cloud later served in the presidential administrations of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was a spokesman for American Indian issues and education throughout his life. It is a residential hall for both men and women.

===Sequoyah Hall===
Sequoyah Hall was built in 1961 and named for Sequoyah, the Cherokee who developed a syllabary writing system for the Cherokee language in the early 19th century; this was the first known independent development of a writing system. It lies on the eastern edge of the main quadrangle area.

===Tecumseh Hall===
Built in 1915 as a gymnasium, Tecumseh Hall was named after the Shawnee chief who led an effort to repulse the European-American settlers from Indian territory west of the Appalachian Mountains. It houses the Campus Shoppe, offices of the Student Senate, Student Activities, and the &quot;Indian Leader&quot; (the campus newspaper).

===Winona Hall===
Originally constructed in 1897, Winona Hall was rebuilt in 1962. The name &quot;Winona&quot; in Lakota tradition is for daughters who are the first-born child of the family. Winona Hall currently is a co-ed honors residential hall, serving both women and men.

== Museums and libraries ==
The Haskell Cultural Center and Museum provides exhibits of interest about the school&#x27;s history, beginning with its opening in 1884. Its archives include collections on Haskell and aspects of Native American history.

Tommaney Library provides a range of academic research resources in print, online and digital form.

==Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork==
The Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork is located south of the campus. It was designed by Haskell professors, students, crop artist Stan Herd, and tribal elders, and dedicated in 1992 as a response to the 500th commemoration of the &quot;Columbian Legacy&quot;.

According to the Haskell Catalog, the medicine wheel earthwork

symbolizes the scope and richness of indigenous cultures, from the beginning of humankind to the present. The circle is symbolic of the perpetual and sacredness of the spirituality of native peoples. The spokes are the four directions. The circle marks the astrological locations of the Summer and Winter solstice and represent the death, rebirth, balance and healing in Mother Earth. The bear claw represents the strength needed for the survival of indigenous people. The thunderbird located to the east represents the spiritual traditions of tribal people and points to the sacred circle and sacred fire contained within the Medicine Wheel Teachings.

A replica of the medicine wheel is carved in the tile at the Haskell Cultural Center and Museum as a way of balancing the campus (with a medicine wheel on the north and south ends of campus).

== Organization ==
The university is one of 37 members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, an organization of Tribal colleges and universities.

== Academics ==

After earning an associate degree, many students transfer to the University of Kansas, other colleges, or join the workforce. Haskell offers four baccalaureate degree programs and four associate degrees in numerous subjects. The university received a #13 ranking on the 2010 &quot;Top 50 Dropout Factory&quot; list from &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; in their College Guide, with a graduation rate of 9%.

===Associate degree programs===

Haskell offers associate of arts (AA) degrees in a variety of fields, including: Communication Studies, Liberal Arts, Media Communication, Para Professional Education, and Social Work. The school also offers associate of science (AS) degrees in: Community Health, Natural Sciences, and Recreation Fitness Management.

===Bachelor programs===

The school also offers the four following bachelor programs:

====Indigenous and American Indian Studies (BA)====
This program provides an integrated foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge and the practical skills needed to contribute to the development of Indigenous American Indian and Alaska Native communities and nations. The program is designed to prepare students for graduate or professional schools, or to enter the workplace after graduation.

====Business Administration (BS)====
The School of Business offers the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with emphases in management or tribal management. The management track emphasizes traditional academic study of contemporary management practices and theories common to the management of human, financial, technical, natural, and other resources. The Tribal Management track explores contemporary and historical issues that particularly affect management of tribal governments and enterprises.

====Elementary Teacher Education (BS)====
Education majors complete a Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education; they must pass the Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) and Elementary Education exam to be eligible to apply for Kansas provisional licensure to teach kindergarten through the sixth grade. Other states may have differing requirements.

====Environmental Sciences (BS)====
This program provides a broad-based background to prepare students for graduate school or a career in environmental or biological fields. Courses offered include Biology, Ecology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, Natural Resources, and Environmental Sciences. It is intended to add substance to indigenous concerns about sustainability.

== Student life ==
More than 20 student organizations and clubs on campus provide students with chances to become involved in campus life and activities related to the larger community.

== Athletics ==
The Haskell (HINU) athletic teams are called the Fighting Indians. The school&#x27;s team colors are purple, gold and white. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Continental Athletic Conference since the 2015–16 academic year. The Fighting Indians previously competed in the defunct Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference (MCAC) from 2001–02 to 2014–15 (when the conference dissolved).

HINU competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Club sports include baseball and boxing. Former sports included football and co-ed cheerleading.

===Football===
Haskell had one of the best college football teams in the nation from 1900 to 1930. Due to funding shortfalls, the football program was suspended beginning for the 2015 season.

<doc id="719811" wikidata="Q6071693" url="?curid=719811" title="Irish neutrality">
<text>Ireland has a longstanding policy of military neutrality, which has meant not joining military alliances or defence pacts, or taking part in international conflicts. The nature of Irish neutrality has varied over time. The Irish Free State declared itself a neutral country in 1922, and Ireland remained neutral during the Second World War; although it allowed Allied military aircraft to fly through part of its airspace, and shared some intelligence with the Allies (see Irish neutrality during World War II). During the Cold War, it did not join NATO nor the Non-Aligned Movement. Since the 1970s, some have defined Irish neutrality more broadly to include a commitment to &quot;United Nations peacekeeping, human rights and disarmament&quot;. Recent Irish governments have defined it narrowly as non-membership of military defensive alliances. Although the republic is not part of any military alliance, it relies on a NATO member, the United Kingdom, to protect Irish airspace. It also allows stopovers by some foreign military aircraft, provided they are not armed.

Ireland is one of four European Union countries that are not members of NATO; the others are Austria, Cyprus and Malta. The compatibility of neutrality with Ireland&#x27;s EU membership has been a point of debate in EU treaty referendum campaigns since the 1990s. The Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice acknowledge Ireland&#x27;s &quot;traditional policy of military neutrality&quot;. The Irish Defence Forces have been involved in many UN peacekeeping missions.

==Concept==
There are notable differences between Irish neutrality and “traditional” types of neutral states:
*Traditionally, neutral states maintain strong defence forces; Ireland has a relatively small defence force of approximately 10,500 personnel.
*Traditionally, neutral states do not allow &quot;any&quot; foreign military within their territory; Ireland has a long history of allowing military aircraft of various nations to refuel at Shannon Airport. Under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, exceptionally, could grant permission to foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the state. Confirmation was required that the aircraft in question be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and that the flights in question would not form part of military exercises or operations.

After the September 11 attacks, these conditions were &quot;waived in respect of aircraft operating in pursuit of the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368&quot;. Irish governments have always said that allowing aircraft to use Irish soil does not constitute participation in any particular conflict and is compatible with a neutral stance, adducing the transit of German troops between Finland and Norway through neutral Swedish territory during World War II.

A neutral state may also allow its citizens to serve in the armed forces of other, possibly belligerent, nations. Ireland does not restrict its citizens from serving in foreign armies, and significant numbers of Irish citizens serve or have served in the British, and to a lesser extent United States armies and the French Foreign Legion.

==Legal status==
Ireland&#x27;s neutrality is in general a matter of government policy rather than a requirement of statute law. One exception is Article 29, section 4, subsection 9° of the Irish constitution:
:The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State.
This was originally inserted by the 2002 amendment ratifying the Treaty of Nice, and updated by the 2009 amendment ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon. An earlier bill intended to ratify the Treaty of Nice did not include a common defence opt-out, and was rejected in the first Nice referendum, in 2001.

The Defence Act 1954, the principal statute governing the Irish Defence Forces, did not oblige members of the Irish Army to serve outside the state (members of the Air Corps and Naval Service were not so limited). A 1960 amendment was intended to allow deployment in United Nations peacekeeping missions, and requires three forms of authorisation, which since the 1990s have come to be called the &quot;triple lock&quot;:
# A UN Security Council resolution or UN General Assembly resolution;
# A formal decision by the Irish government;
# Approval by a resolution of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas or parliament, to which the government is responsible).
These provisions were modified in 1993 to allow for Chapter VII missions and again in 2006 to allow for regionally organised UN missions.

==History==

===Before independence===
Irish leaders in the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603) allied with Habsburg Spain, who sent military aid to the Irish. Following their defeat, all of Ireland was a dependency of England and then of Great Britain. During this period, Catholic soldiers from Ireland fought in the armies of several European Catholic countries, in what is known as the Flight of the Wild Geese. In 1644–1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Irish Confederacy sent a military expedition to Scotland to help the Scottish Royalists. During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the United Irishmen sought and received military assistance from the French First Republic.

Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1801 to 1922. While Irish unionists supported political integration with Britain, Irish nationalists were divided between those who envisaged some continuing link with Britain and the &quot;advanced nationalists&quot;, mainly republicans, who wanted full independence. Separatists generally envisaged an independent Ireland being neutral, but were prepared to ally with Britain&#x27;s enemies in order to secure that independence, reflected in the maxim &quot;England&#x27;s difficulty is Ireland&#x27;s opportunity&quot;. At the outbreak of the First World War, James Connolly was president of the Irish Neutrality League and was prosecuted for a banner reading &quot;We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland&quot;. During the 1916 Easter Rising, Connolly and the other leaders of the uprising sought military aid from Germany. 

In the 1921 negotiations leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Erskine Childers envisaged the Irish Republic having a neutral status guaranteed in international law on the model of Belgium and Switzerland.

===Irish Free State===
The Irish Free State established in 1922 by the Anglo-Irish Treaty was a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, with the UK retaining responsibility for Ireland&#x27;s marine defence as well as three naval bases, the &quot;Treaty Ports&quot;. Article 49 of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State stated, &quot;Save in the case of actual invasion, the Irish Free State ... shall not be committed to active participation in any war without the assent of the Oireachtas [parliament]&quot;. In the Third Dáil debate on the draft constitution, the Provisional Government rejected a Labour Party amendment requiring assent of the electorate via referendum. Thomas Johnson argued &quot;The war that is to be guarded against is a war overseas, is a war that this country may be drawn into by Parliament, by the will of Parliament perhaps, at the instigation of perhaps Canada, or perhaps Australia, or perhaps South Africa, or perhaps Great Britain, and the last is very much the more likely&quot;.

In the Statute of Westminster 1931, the UK renounced the right to legislate for the Free State. The 1938 Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement saw the Treaty Ports handed over to the Free State.

The Free State joined the International Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Act, 1937 made it an offence to travel from Ireland to Spain to fight for either side. This applied both to Irish citizens and nationals of other countries on the committee. Nevertheless, there was Irish involvement in the Spanish Civil War on both sides by private individuals and groups. Another statute related to the committee was the Merchant Shipping (Spanish Civil War) Act 1937, which restricted Irish shipping&#x27;s access to Spain until 27 April 1939.

===World War II===
Ireland remained neutral during World War II. The Fianna Fáil government&#x27;s position was flagged years in advance by Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and had broad support. James Dillon was the only member of Dáil Éireann to oppose it during the war, resigning from Fine Gael in 1942 and demanding that Ireland assist the Allies (while not necessarily declaring war on the Axis). However, tens of thousands of Irish citizens, who were by law British subjects, fought in the Allied armies against the Nazis, mostly in the British army. Senators John Keane and Frank MacDermot also favoured Allied support.

De Valera said in his wartime speeches that small states should stay out of the conflicts of big powers; hence Ireland&#x27;s policy was officially &quot;neutral&quot;, and the country did not publicly declare its support for either side. In practice, while Luftwaffe pilots who crash-landed in Ireland and German sailors were interned, Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) pilots who crashed were released on personal assurances and usually allowed to cross the border into British territory (although some Allied personnel were also interned). The internees were referred to as &quot;guests of the nation&quot;. The German embassy had to pay for their keep. If they were on a non-combative mission they were repatriated. While it was easy for Allied pilots to make that claim, it was not realistic for Luftwaffe pilots to make a similar claim. Towards the end of the war, the German embassy was unable to pay, so the internees had to work on local farms. Strict wartime press censorship had the effect of controlling a moral reaction to the war&#x27;s unfolding events and reiterated the public position that Irish neutrality was morally superior to the stance of any of the combatants.

Allied military aircraft were allowed to overfly County Donegal to bases in County Fermanagh. This was known as the Donegal Corridor. The bodies of any crashed Allied airmen were repatriated by the Irish Army at the border, where they would be met by an Allied officer. On at least one occasion, an Allied Air Force officer thanked his Irish counterpart for the honour they bestowed upon the repatriated airmen. The Irish captain was said to reply, &quot;Ours may be the honour, but yours is the glory.&quot;

USAAF aircraft flying to North Africa refuelled at Shannon Airport and flying boats at nearby Foynes.

During the war, an estimated 70,000 citizens of neutral Ireland served as volunteers in the British Armed Forces (and another estimated 50,000 from Northern Ireland). Those who deserted the Irish Army to serve in the British Army, on returning to Ireland were stripped of all pay and pension rights, and banned for seven years from any employment paid for by state or government funds. 

Irish military intelligence (G2) shared information with the British military and even held secret meetings to decide what to do if Germany invaded Ireland to attack Britain, which resulted in Plan W, a plan for joint Irish and British military action should the Germans invade. However General Hugo McNeill, the commander of the Irish Second Division based on the Northern Ireland border, had private discussions with the German ambassador, Edouard Hempel, about German military assistance in the event of a British invasion from the north. De Valera declined Germany&#x27;s offer of captured British weapons. The Germans did have a plan for an invasion of Ireland called Operation Green, similar to the Allies&#x27; Operation Bodyguard, but it was only to be put into operation with Operation Sea Lion, the plan to conquer Britain.

During the Belfast Blitz in April 1941, when the Luftwaffe bombed Belfast in Northern Ireland, De Valera responded immediately to a request for help from Basil Brooke, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Fire engines were sent from the south to help their Belfast colleagues. De Valera formally protested to the German government and made a speech declaring &quot;they are our people&quot;.

Irish neutrality during the war was threatened from within by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which sought to provoke a confrontation between Britain and Ireland. This plan collapsed, however, when IRA chief of staff Seán Russell died in a U-boat off the Irish coast as part of Operation Dove; the Germans also later came to realise they had overestimated the capabilities of the IRA. The American ambassador, David Gray, stated that he once asked de Valera, early in the war, what he would do if German paratroopers &quot;liberated&quot; Derry. According to Gray, de Valera was silent for a time and then replied &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

Many German spies were sent to Ireland, but all were captured quickly as a result of good intelligence and sometimes their ineptitude. The chief Abwehr spy was Hermann Görtz.

As the state was neutral, Irish cargo ships continued to sail with full navigation lights. They had large tricolours and the word &quot;EIRE&quot; painted large on their sides and decks. Irish ships rescued more than 500 seamen, and some airmen, from many countries during the war. However, many Irish ships were attacked by belligerents on both sides. Over 20% of Irish seamen died, on clearly marked neutral vessels, in the Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II.

Winston Churchill, the British wartime Prime Minister, made an attack on the Irish Government and in particular Éamon de Valera in his radio broadcast on VE Day. Churchill maintained that the British government displayed restraint on the Irish state while the de Valera government were allowed to &quot;frolic with the Germans&quot;. Churchill maintained that the British could have invaded the Irish state, but displayed &quot;considerable restraint&quot; in not doing so. De Valera replied to Churchill in a radio broadcast:
Mr. Churchill makes it clear that in certain circumstances he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his action by Britain&#x27;s necessity. It seems strange to me that Mr. Churchill does not see that this, if accepted, would mean that Britain&#x27;s necessity would become a moral code and that when this necessity became sufficiently great, other people&#x27;s rights were not to count...this same code is precisely why we have the disastrous succession of wars... shall it be world war number three?
===The Cold War===
During the Cold War, Ireland maintained its policy of neutrality. It did not align itself officially with NATO, the Warsaw Pact, or the Non-Aligned Movement. It refused to join NATO due to a sovereignty dispute over Northern Ireland with the United Kingdom, a NATO member. Ireland offered to set up a separate alliance with the United States but this was refused. This offer was linked in part to the $133 million received from the Marshall Aid Plan.

However, secret transmission of information from the government to the CIA started in 1955. The link was established by Liam Cosgrave via a Mr. Cram and the Irish embassy in London, and was not revealed until December 2007. In 1962–63, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Seán Lemass authorised searches of aircraft that stopped over at Shannon while flying between Warsaw Pact countries and Cuba, for &quot;warlike material&quot;.

In 1952 the government agreed a secret memorandum of understanding with the UK government regarding air defence, under which the Royal Air Force can apply to intercept hostile aircraft in Irish airspace, conscious of the lack of capability of the Irish Air Corps to do so. The agreement has been renewed by subsequent governments despite misgivings. In 2023, Senator Gerard Craughwell applied to the High Court for a judicial review of its constitutionality.

Ireland applied to join the then European Communities in 1963 and finally acceded in 1973. Garret FitzGerald, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs 1973–77, claims that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the 1960s and 1970s accepted that European integration would eventually reach a point where Ireland would have to join in defence co-operation. FitzGerald points to Charles Haughey&#x27;s opposition to the explicit mention of neutrality in a 1981 Dáil motion, stating that Haughey adopted a more pro-neutrality stance upon entering opposition later in 1981.

===1990s–2010s===

The 1994 coalition government undertook not to change the policy of military neutrality without a referendum. That government&#x27;s 1996 white paper on foreign policy stated:
:The majority of the Irish people have always cherished Ireland&#x27;s military neutrality, and recognise the positive values that inspire it, in peace-time as well as time of war. Neutrality has been the policy of the State in the event of armed conflict and has provided the basis for Ireland&#x27;s wider efforts to promote international peace and security.
It recommended joining NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace and participating in humanitarian missions of the Western European Union (WEU), but opposed joining NATO or the WEU as incompatible with military neutrality.

Ireland provided 120 Defence Forces personnel as trainers to the International Security Assistance Force mission in the 2001–2021 Afghanistan War. The personnel were provided under United Nations mandate.

The Fianna Fáil-led government did not take a position on the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ireland, then a member of the UN Security Council, voted &quot;yes&quot; to Resolution 1441, which warned of &quot;serious consequences&quot; if Iraq did not comply with weapons inspectors. Some United States Air Force planes were allowed to refuel at Shannon Airport before and during the conflict, as were civilian aircraft transporting US military personnel; others had permission to overfly Irish air space. A resolution of the Dáil on 20 March 2003 approved these arrangements.

Anti-war activist Edward Horgan took a case in the High Court seeking declarations that the government, in allowing use of Shannon, had breached the state&#x27;s obligations as a neutral state. While the court held that the custom in international law was that &quot;a neutral state may not permit the movement of large numbers of troops or munitions of one belligerent State through its territory en route to a theatre of war with another&quot;, it found this was not part of Irish domestic law, as Irish neutrality was &quot;a matter of government policy only&quot;. The Dáil resolution implied that letting military aircraft refuel at Shannon did not amount to &quot;participation&quot; in the war, and the courts had no power to overrule the Dáil on this issue.

In 2006, the Minister for Defence, Willie O&#x27;Dea, announced that the Irish government would open talks on joining the European Union battle groups. O&#x27;Dea said that joining the battlegroups would not affect Ireland&#x27;s military neutrality, and that a UN mandate would be required for all battlegroup operations with Irish participation. Green Party foreign affairs spokesperson John Gormley condemned the decision, saying that the government was &quot;discarding the remnants of Irish neutrality&quot;.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said in 2007: &quot;the truth is, Ireland is not neutral. We are merely unaligned&quot;.

In 2012, the Oireachtas established a joint committee to review petitions submitted by the public. An early petition sought clarification of government policy in relation to the use of Irish airspace by foreign military aircraft. In 2013–16 the committee held discussions with the petitioners, government members, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and academics, and issued a report, which stated:
:The Joint Committee note the lacuna between what is understood by the citizens by neutrality and what is the position. Accordingly, the Joint Committee recommend that the Dáil and Seanad debate the matter of neutrality with a view to the holding of a Referendum so that the will of the people can be determined.

In 2015, the Fine Gael–Labour government published a foreign policy review which stated, &quot;Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy.&quot; It defined neutrality as &quot;non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements&quot;, while working with international organisations for peacekeeping missions.
Since the Russian annexation of Crimea, Russian bomber aircraft have deliberately flown into Irish-controlled airspace several times, without warning, and with their transponders switched off. As the Irish Air Corps lacks air defence, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) have had to intercept these bombers. In February 2015, two Russian Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; bombers flew into Irish-controlled airspace twice, with their transponders switched off. The Norwegian and British militaries confirmed that the bombers were carrying nuclear warheads. The bombers flew within 25 nautical miles of the Irish coast, and were intercepted by RAF Eurofighter Typhoon jets.

Ireland joined the EU&#x27;s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) when it was founded in December 2017. The Fine Gael-led government said it would participate on a case-by-case basis and membership did not compromise neutrality. Fianna Fáil supported membership; Sinn Féin, the Greens, Solidarity, and People Before Profit opposed it; the Labour Party had reservations.

===Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine===
In January 2022, during the buildup to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia controversially announced plans to hold naval drills about 150 nautical miles off the coast, within Ireland&#x27;s exclusive economic zone. It was to involve naval artillery and missiles. Local fishermen protested to the Russian embassy and announced they would continue to fish in the area regardless. Russia&#x27;s Ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov, warned the fishermen to &quot;refrain from any provocative actions which might endanger all involved&quot;. Eventually, in response to requests from the Irish government, Russia&#x27;s Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu agreed to move the naval drills further away from Ireland.

In a Dáil discussion that month on the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit asked:
:Why does the Government correctly condemn Russian military exercises in Irish waters but allow the US military to use Shannon Airport [?] ... Neutrality means not taking sides in dangerous conflicts and game-playing between major imperial powers.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin replied:
:Ireland accepts Ukrainian territorial integrity [...] We&#x27;re not politically neutral but we&#x27;re militarily neutral. It&#x27;s an important distinction. We&#x27;re members of the European Union. We work with our European Union colleagues in terms of rules-based multilateral approaches to international disputes.

In response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar stated that while Ireland is not militarily aligned, the country is &quot;not neutral at all&quot; in relation to this conflict and that &quot;support for Ukraine is unwavering and unconditional&quot;. Days later the Department of Foreign Affairs said it would &quot;constructively abstain&quot; from an EU fund for military aid to Ukraine, but contribute instead to a fund that did not include weaponry.

Since the invasion, the Irish Navy and Air Corps have increasingly observed Russian &quot;spy ships&quot; believed to be mapping critical undersea communications cables and energy pipelines off the Irish coast. Some of them are escorted by Russian warships and are fitted with equipment for sabotaging undersea cables.

In March 2023 a bill to hold a referendum on Irish membership in a hypothetical European army was opposed by the government, who called it &quot;unnecessary&quot;. Micheál Martin said that if the referendum had taken place he was confident it would have passed and that Ireland needs to &#x27;reflect&#x27; on the issue of neutrality.

A Consultative Forum on International Security Policy was held in Dublin, Cork and Galway during 2023. It was a public forum to discuss Ireland&#x27;s foreign, security and defence policy. Micheál Martin, then Minister for Defence and Foreign Affairs, said every country in Europe had reviewed their defence and security in the wake of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, rebuffed the forum, saying that Ireland was drifting away from neutrality and &quot;playing with fire&quot;. His comments were criticised by government ministers. The forum was disrupted by anti-NATO protesters from the Connolly Youth Movement; with Martin describing them as &quot;undemocratic&quot; and &quot;trying to shut down debate&quot;. Boyd Barrett accused those involved in the forum of &quot;trying to soften up public opinion to abandoning Ireland&#x27;s neutrality.&quot;

==United Nations peacekeeping==
Irish Defence Forces have seen active service as part of United Nations peacekeeping activitiesinitially in the early 1960s Congo Crisis, and subsequently in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and Lebanon (UNIFIL).

==Weapons control==
A 2004 report by Forfás noted that the policy of neutrality is a factor in Ireland&#x27;s lack of an arms industry and strict export controls on weapons. The latter were previously enforced by the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order 2009, a statutory instrument made under the Control of Exports Act 1983. The 2009 order was replaced by the Control of Exports (Goods and Technology) Order 2012, which reflects the 2008 EU Common Position on Arms Exports. The 2004 Forfás report noted concerns about dual-use technology and the use as weapons components of products from major Irish export industries such as chemicals, telecommunications equipment, computer chips and software. The state is also bound by EU regulations and international arms control treaties. In 2017, four export licence applications were refused for dual-use items. In the 1980s and early 1990s, successive governments rebuffed proposals by companies including Eurometaal and Thyssen Henschel to establish arms manufacturing and repair plants in the state, on the grounds that it might compromise neutrality and that there was then no specific legislation limiting the area to which the arms could be exported.

<text>PlainTalk is the collective name for several speech synthesis (MacinTalk) and speech recognition technologies developed by Apple Inc. In 1990, Apple invested a lot of work and money in speech recognition technology, hiring many researchers in the field. The result was &quot;PlainTalk&quot;, released with the AV models in the Macintosh Quadra series from 1993. It was made a standard system component in System 7.1.2, and has since been shipped on all PowerPC and some 68k Macintoshes.

==Software==
===Speech synthesis===
====Technology====
Apple&#x27;s text-to-speech uses diphones. Compared to other methods of synthesizing speech, it is not very resource-intensive, but limits how natural the speech synthesis can be. American English and Spanish versions have been available, but since the advent of Mac OS X, Apple has shipped only American English voices, relying on third-party suppliers such as Acapela Group to supply voices for other languages (in OS X 10.7, Apple licensed a lot of third-party voices and made them available for download within the Speech control panel).

An application programming interface known as the Speech Manager enables third-party developers to use speech synthesis in their applications. There are various control sequences that can be used to fine-tune the intonation and rhythm. The volume, pitch and rate of the speech can be configured as well, allowing for singing.

Input to the synthesizer can be controlled explicitly using a special phoneme alphabet.

====Original MacinTalk====

The initial Macintosh text-to-speech engine, MacinTalk (named by Denise Chandler), was used by Apple in the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh in which the computer announced itself to the world (and poked fun at the weight of an IBM computer). While it was incorporated into the Macintosh&#x27;s operating system, it was not officially supported by Apple (though programming information was made available through an Apple Technical Note). MacinTalk was developed by Joseph Katz and Mark Barton who later founded SoftVoice, Inc. which currently markets TTS engines for Windows, Linux and embedded platforms. MacinTalk used direct access to the original Macintosh sound hardware and all attempts to license the source code by Apple to update it for newer Macs failed.

====MacinTalk 2====

Eventually, Apple released a supported speech synthesis system, called MacinTalk 2. It supports any Macintosh running System Software 6.0.7 or later. It remained the recommended version for slower machines even after the release of MacinTalk 3 and Pro.

====MacinTalk 3, Pro====
MacinTalk 3 introduced a great variety of voices. Apart from the standard adult voices &quot;Ralph&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot; and &quot;Kathy&quot;, and children&#x27;s voices like &quot;Princess&quot; (renamed &quot;Superstar&quot; in macOS Ventura) and &quot;Junior&quot;, various novelty voices were included, like &quot;Whisper&quot;, &quot;Zarvox&quot; (a robotic voice with melodic background sounds, with a similar voice called &quot;Trinoids&quot; also included), &quot;Cellos&quot; (a voice that sang its text to an Edvard Grieg tune, otherwise known as &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; with similarly singing voices like &quot;Good News&quot;, &quot;Bad News&quot;, &quot;Pipe Organ&quot;), &quot;Albert&quot; (a hoarse-sounding voice), &quot;Bells&quot;, &quot;Boing&quot;, &quot;Bubbles&quot;, and others.

Each of these voices came with its own example text, that would be spoken when one hit the &quot;Test&quot; button in the Speech control panel. Some would just say their name, language and the version of MacinTalk they were introduced with. Others would say funny things, like &quot;I sure like being inside this fancy computer&quot;, &quot;I have a frog in my throat... No, I mean a real frog!&quot;, &quot;We must rejoice in this morbid voice&quot; (a parody of Western church hymnody with organ music), or &quot;The light you see at the end of the tunnel is the headlamp of a fast approaching train&quot;. These voices are still in macOS today. (A few of the voice names and their test texts were changed with macOS Ventura, and then all their test texts were changed in macOS Sonoma to &quot;Hello, my name is [voice name].&quot;)

With the increase in computing power that the AV Macs and PowerPC based Macintoshes provided, Apple could afford to increase the quality of the synthesis. MacinTalk 3 required a 33 MHz 68030 processor and MacinTalk Pro required a 68040 or better and at least 1 MB of RAM. Each synthesizer supported a different set of voices.

====Text-to-speech in Mac OS X====
Text-to-speech has been a part of every Mac OS X (later macOS) version. The Victoria voice was enhanced significantly in Mac OS X v10.3, and added as Vicki (Victoria was not removed). Its size was almost 20 times greater, because of the higher-quality diphone samples used.

A new, much more natural-sounding voice, called &quot;Alex&quot; has been added to the Mac text-to-speech roster with the release of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

With Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, voices are available in additional U.S. English and other English accents, as well as 21 other languages.
The &quot;Speak selected text when key is pressed&quot; feature allows selected text from any application to be read via a key combination. From Mac OS X 10.1 to Mac OS X 10.6, the feature would copy the selected text to the clipboard and read it from there. From Mac OS X 10.7 to Mac OS X 10.10, a new implementation of the feature required software developers to implement a speech synthesis API into their applications. This prevented the clipboard from being overwritten, but also meant that, for applications that did not use the API, the feature would not function as expected, reading the title bar rather than the selected text.

In macOS Sierra 10.12, Siri was introduced for the Mac, however, the voice was not available as a System Voice, which meant that the Siri voices could be only used in Siri. Siri was made available as a System voice in macOS Catalina 10.15, so that it would work for any text. The Siri voices work in a completely different way and the command remains unable to use Siri.

In the macOS Big Sur 11.3 update, gender references to all voices were removed, coinciding with the change in Siri voices on iOS 14.5 and macOS 11.3 and later, as part of Apple&#x27;s efforts to promote gender inclusivity.

===Speech recognition===
Apple hired many speech recognition researchers in 1990. After about a year, they demonstrated a technology codenamed Casper. It was released as part of the PlainTalk package in 1993. Although available for all PowerPC Macintoshes and AV 68k machines (it was one of the few applications that made use of the DSP in the Centris 660AV and Quadra 840AV), it was not part of the default system install prior to Mac OS X, requiring the user to perform a custom OS installation to get speech recognition capabilities.

In Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and earlier, Apple&#x27;s speech recognition was voice-command oriented only, i.e. not intended for dictation. It can be configured to listen for commands when a hot key is pressed, after being addressed with an activation phrase such as &quot;Computer&quot;, or &quot;Macintosh&quot;, or without prompt. A graphical status monitor, often in the form of an animated character, provides visual and textual feedback about listening status, available commands and actions. It can also communicate back with the user using speech synthesis.

Early versions of the speech recognition provided full access to the menus. This support was later removed, since it required too many resources and made recognition less reliable, only to be re-added in Mac OS X 10.3 as a &quot;universal access technology&quot; called spoken user interface.

The user can launch items located in a special folder, called &quot;Speakable Items&quot;, simply by speaking their name (while the system is in &quot;listening&quot; mode). Apple shipped a number of AppleScripts in this folder, but aliases, documents and folders can be opened in the same way.

Additional functionality is provided by individual applications. An application programming interface lets programs define and modify an available vocabulary. For example, the Finder provides a vocabulary for manipulating files and windows.

In OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple introduced &quot;Dictation,&quot; intended for general text. Originally, it required the sending of audio data to Apple servers for processing. In OS X 10.9 Mavericks, Apple added the option to download support for dictation without an Internet connection. As of OS X 10.9.3, eight languages (19 dialects) are supported.

==Hardware==
Apple produced two microphones under the product name &quot;Apple PlainTalk Microphone&quot;. The first shipped inclusive with Macintosh LC and early Performa models, and was circular in appearance. It was designed to sit in a holder attached to the side of a CRT display, and be lifted out and held by the mouth when talking. The second model was introduced alongside the AV models in the Macintosh Quadra series in 1993 but was also sold separately. It was designed to be positioned on top of the screen and to be sensitive to sound from the front. Both models had a longer connector, the tip of which was used to provide the microphone with bias voltage.

<doc id="719821" wikidata="Q2568022" url="?curid=719821" title="Karma (character)">
<text>Karma (Xuân Cao Mạnh) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100 (December 1980). She is mostly in association with The X-Men.

She belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Karma is endowed with the ability to seize control of another&#x27;s mind, though she has sometimes been depicted with other more extensive psionic abilities. The origin of the character relates to the Vietnam War, as she and her family were among the boat people fleeing the country shortly after the advent of Communism and in the wake of violence. During her fateful encounters with Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, she absorbs her brother&#x27;s powers and body to prevent him from endangering the group, thus doubling her powers in the process. Her Vietnamese origin contributes to two of her main traits—her Catholicism and her mastery of the French language, both of which stem from France&#x27;s strong historical influence in Vietnam. Karma speaks English with a French accent rather than a Vietnamese one.

Karma was one of the five founding members of the New Mutants, along with Cannonball, Mirage, Sunspot and Wolfsbane. Being several years older than the others, and the legal guardian of her siblings from a young age, she was the most mature member, and the only one in the original lineup who was introduced in published comics before the team itself. Karma is one of the first major lesbian characters in a mainstream comic book.

==Publication history==
Karma first appears in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100 (December 1980). She joins the New Mutants as a founding member in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4: &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (September 1982) and appears as a regular cast member in &quot;New Mutants&quot; from issues #1–6 (1983) and issues #29–54 (1985–87), in which she leaves the team to search for her kidnapped siblings. Her search brings her to Madripoor, and she guest stars in &quot;Wolverine&quot; volume 2 issues #4–8 (1989) and #27–30 (1990).

In 1994, she appears in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; crossover between X-Force and The New Warriors, and features in three limited series: &quot;Beast&quot; #1–3 (1997), &quot;New Mutants: Truth or Death&quot; #1–3 (1997–98) and &quot;Mekanix&quot; (2002–03). In &quot;New Mutants&quot; volume 2, she returns to the X-Mansion as a faculty member and continues to appear irregularly as a supporting character when that title was relaunched as &quot;New X-Men&quot;.

After M-Day, Karma retains her powers, and joins the main X-Men team when they relocate to Utopia. She is assigned to the New Mutants team of the X-Men and features in &quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 3 issues #1–28, after which she leaves Utopia for the Jean Grey School as part of the Schism. Karma then serves with Wolverine&#x27;s X-Men and is featured in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; volume 3, starting with issue #49.

=== Character name ===
When Karma was introduced in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100, her name was given as &quot;Xi&#x27;an Coy Manh&quot;. In &quot;Love Unlimited Infinity Comic&quot; #31, published on January 5, 2023, the character&#x27;s name was revised to &quot;Xuân Cao Mạnh&quot;, or &quot;Mạnh Cao Xuân&quot; using Vietnamese naming order. &quot;Love Unlimited Infinity Comic&quot; #31 was written and illustrated by Vietnamese-American cartoonist Trung Le Nguyen, who explained the rationale for the change:

==Fictional character biography==
===Introduction===
Xuân (pronounced &quot;Swun&quot;, but nicknamed &quot;Shan&quot;) Cao Mạnh was born in the central highlands of Vietnam. Xuân&#x27;s origins are rooted in tragedy. Her father was a colonel in the South Vietnamese army who was forced to bring his wife and four children on missions. When Xuân&#x27;s twin brother, Tran Cao Mạnh, was attacked by a Viet Cong soldier, Xuân&#x27;s power of mind possession emerged to protect him. Tran soon exhibited the identical power, although he relished using it cruelly. While Tran was rescued from the throes of war by their crime lord uncle, General Nguyen Ngoc Cao, Xuân&#x27;s father was shot and killed during the fall of Saigon. Xuân escaped on a cramped boat with hundreds of others, including her mother and her younger brother and sister, Leong and Nga. The boat was boarded by Thai pirates on the way to the United States; Xuân and her mother were raped by the pirates and her mother died shortly thereafter.

Arriving in New York City, a program to help Vietnamese immigrants run by the Catholic priest Father Michael Bowen (Dagger&#x27;s uncle) helped Xuân find work and an apartment. However, General Cao insisted she use her powers in his service, as Tran was already doing, and kidnapped Leong and Nga when she refused. Possessing Spider-Man, she attempted to use him to reclaim the children from a party her uncle was holding. The Fantastic Four intervened. Tran, not realizing Xuân was in control of Spider-Man, forced her out of Spider-Man&#x27;s mind in possessing him long enough for the Thing to knock him out. With technical aid from Professor X, the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man located Xuân. After an initial misunderstanding, they agreed to help her reclaim the children, but Tran possessed the Fantastic Four and set them against Spider-Man. Spider-Man was outmatched by Tran&#x27;s ability to use the Fantastic Four as a single cohesive force due to his greater experience with his powers. Xuân finally lashed out and bested Tran in a psychic battle, absorbing him completely and permanently imprisoning him within her soul, taking the name Karma afterwards. Her powers doubled after absorbing and imprisoning Tran inside her soul.

===New Mutants===
Reed Richards refers Karma to Professor X, and she becomes his first recruit for his new team of mutant teenagers, the New Mutants. Karma had been working a full-time job to support herself and her siblings, and so agrees to work as Xavier&#x27;s secretary to help him run the school in return for a generous salary.

During an attack by the Sentinels, the other New Mutants begin implicitly following Karma as their leader. While they are rescuing the New Mutant Mirage from a terrorist complex in Big Sur, the mutant psychic entity Amahl Farouk takes Karma as a host body, and Viper and the Silver Samurai blow up the complex. Karma disappears during the destruction of the complex and the rest of the team fears her to be dead. The circumstances of her disappearance are not revealed until later and vary from version to version; in one account, when the complex collapses her teammate Sunspot tries to grab her as she falls off a cliff into the sea but is too slow, while in another account, Sunspot successfully grabs her and falls into the sea with her, and only then loses his grip. Possessed by Farouk, she becomes a crime boss and runs a gladiatorial arena. She becomes grossly obese while possessed, as Farouk was a large eater in life and had continued his voracity when using Karma&#x27;s body. When two of the New Mutants (Sunspot and Magma) are forced to participate in the high-stakes gladiatorial competition, she comes into conflict with her old teammates.

The New Mutants pursue her and ultimately drive Farouk to flee from Karma&#x27;s body, and she defeats him in psychic combat. The New Mutants and Storm take a vacation on a small Grecian island. There they are abducted by the Enchantress. Magik attempts to teleport everyone away, but her teleport disc collides with the barrier around the Enchantress&#x27;s castle, and they are tossed all over Asgard. Karma ends up in a desert wasteland and, still despondent at her obesity, she decides to lay down and die. However, the Norns intervene and place a young child near her, compelling Karma to survive in order to help the child out of the desert. Karma and the child live in the desert for months, using her powers to stun the wildlife for food, and scavenging weapons and shelter from travelers who have perished in the wasteland. By the time she reaches the end of the desert and reunites with the other New Mutants, she has shed her excess weight and her hair had grown to waist-length. When Loki returns the New Mutants and X-Men to Earth, although he undoes most of their transformations — such as Moonstar having become a Valkyrie and thus inherited a winged steed — he ensures that Karma retains her new slimmer physique. After an encounter with — and temporary death at the hands of — the Beyonder, she and her fellow New Mutants are briefly transferred to the Massachusetts Academy and join the Hellions.

Father Bowen, Karma&#x27;s confessor, cared for Leong and Nga during Karma&#x27;s absence, but she resumes caring for the youths upon her return to the New Mutants, living in a small apartment on Mạnhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. During the Mutant Massacre, Leong and Nga fail to turn up at home after leaving school. The Xavier School&#x27;s headmaster, Magneto, is unable to locate the missing children, even with the resources of the Hellfire Club at his disposal. Believing her uncle has a better chance of finding them, Karma leaves the New Mutants to return to General Cao&#x27;s service in exchange for his help.

===Searching for Leong and Nga===
In Madripoor, she works to help her uncle establish himself as one of the nation&#x27;s two major crime lords. After the X-Man Wolverine appeals to her conscience, she begins covertly acting against Cao when his actions threaten innocent lives. General Cao strings Karma along for several months with promises of finding the children, but after he and some of his associates orchestrate the massacre of an entire village, she breaks her ties with him.

Karma continues her search independently, and learns the children were abducted by Shinobi Shaw and sold to Viper and Spiral, intent on sending the children through the &quot;Body Shoppe&quot;. With the aid of Cannonball and Beast, Karma finally locates and frees Leong and Nga, while learning that her brother&#x27;s essence is still alive, though dormant, within her.

Karma reunites with the original New Mutants when they meet their past selves traveling to the present. Karma evidences expanded telepathic powers, specifically removing the memories of the older New Mutants from the minds of the younger ones by briefly possessing them. Karma later meets many New Mutants friends, in the form of X-Force, at a desert rave, where she drastically altered her appearance with dyed hair, body piercings, and revealing clothing; a surprising difference to the image held by many of her former teammates.

She moves to Chicago with Leong and Nga and takes a job as a librarian for the University of Chicago while attending classes. There, she runs into Shadowcat and assists her in her mission against the anti-mutant hate group, Purity, while also hinting at a same sex attraction to her. Not long after, she came out as gay.

===Teacher at Xavier&#x27;s===

Months afterwards, Danielle Moonstar, another ex-New Mutant, drops by the University of Chicago while trying to recruit Prodigy to the renamed Xavier Institute. Karma decides to return to Xavier&#x27;s, where she serves as the librarian and French teacher. She is specifically chosen as a mentor by the younger student Anole, and later is mentor to all students less than fifteen years of age (thus too young to be assigned to squads). She returns to a more modest appearance and attire to better reflect her new position.

When Rahne Sinclair leaves the Xavier Institute due to a romance with a younger student, her position as advisor of the Paragons squad is left to Karma. Upon the (temporary) death of Northstar, Karma also becomes the advisor to his squad, the Alpha Squadron. Magma eventually takes over duties as the advisor of the Paragons, yet that still leaves Karma as the librarian, French teacher, and advisor to the Lower School and Alpha Squadron.

Karma retains her powers after M-Day. The school&#x27;s population is drastically reduced and the squad system is abolished. She continues to reside at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, though she is not part of an X-Men team.

She is present when Apocalypse returns and tries to stop some of the 198 from accepting his offer to join him.

===Manifest Destiny===
Karma moves to Utopia along with the X-Men and trains with Emma Frost in the use of her powers and the control of her emotions. She serves with the X-Men on several missions, including acting as bait to lure out the Hellfire Cult and opposing the Sisterhood in its attempt restore Psylocke to her original body.

===Reforming the New Mutants===
Karma accompanies Mirage to a small Colorado town to investigate reports of a dangerous young mutant. After they turn up missing, Cannonball obtains permission from Cyclops to track them down, teaming up with old New Mutants members Magma, Sunspot and Magik, who reappeared at the X-Men&#x27;s base after teleporting off into the future after the events of &quot;X-Infernus&quot;. Magik informs Cannonball and Sunspot that Karma and Mirage are in danger which would result in their deaths. As it turns out, Karma&#x27;s consciousness is trapped inside Legion&#x27;s mind, and she is ultimately rescued by Magik with the aid of her Soulsword.

Due to their success in reining in the dangerous Legion, Karma and the other former New Mutants on the mission are sanctioned as an X-Men squad by Cyclops.

===Utopia===
Karma is seen during the riots in San Francisco with Armor, Match, Angel, and Bling trying to keep calm. She tells Nekra and Frenzy to behave when Ms. Marvel blasts the duo, taking them out.

In the aftermath of Utopia, Xuân goes to see Kavita Rao with Magik where they inform her of what went on in Legion&#x27;s mind. When Kavita mistakes Marci for one of Legion&#x27;s personalities, Xuân corrects her and reveals that Marci was a real person but when she exited his mind, Legion revealed Marci does not have a body to return to and explains how his powers work. She then reveals that one of Legion&#x27;s personalities killed her after she bought Legion water and played together when he got back from the Age of Apocalypse. Feeling angry, Illyana offers her soulsword to Xuân who kills the alternate personality. However Xuân lies to Kavita about what happened as does Magik, both claiming Magik killed him.

===Second Coming===
Karma is sent with her teammates to engage The Right and Cameron Hodge at his facility. During the battle, she attempts to take psionic control of Hodge, but he proves immune to her powers and impales her through the leg with his metal pincer blades. Hodge is defeated, but as a result of her injuries, Karma loses her left leg just above the knee. She then gets a new prosthetic leg from Madison Jeffries.

===Schism/Regenesis===
Following the events of the Age of X, Karma leaves the New Mutants squad to focus on rehabilitating Face. Like many other mutants, Karma leaves Utopia for Westchester after the Schism, where she joins a team of X-Men under Wolverine.

===&quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;===
Karma joins an ad hoc team of X-Men who find themselves under attack by the Marauders. The Marauders are controlled by Susan Hatchi, a successful weapons developer who wished to test out new nanotechnology that her company had developed.

After seizing control of Karma, it is revealed that Hatchi also had ulterior personal reasons for targeting the mutant. Born Da&#x27;o Cao Mạnh, she is the illegitimate half-sister of Karma. Da&#x27;o&#x27;s mother had sought out their father for protection and for Da&#x27;o to be recognized as his daughter. Instead, he shot and killed her mother. He then abandons Da&#x27;o to work at a sweatshop. Da&#x27;o eventually manifested low-level telepathic powers, changed her name and began building her weapons development company. She later discovered that their father had used his influence to smuggle his legitimate family to the U.S., which made her resentment grow. This was further compounded when her powers were lost during M-Day.

In a later confrontation with the X-Men, Hatchi uses her nanotechnology to seize control of the team and orders them to takeover Madripoor or she will use her technology on New York and kill the population. She wants to not only demonstrate the effectiveness of her weapon but to draw out their father from hiding by publicly using Karma as bait. While she is able to locate her father in Madripoor, the X-Men are able to counteract the technology. Karma uses her own mutant abilities to forge a psychic link with her half-sister and show her the struggles she&#x27;s had in her own life, despite the fact that their father acknowledged her. While the two sisters reach reconciliation, their father takes advantage of their engagement and shoots Hatchi. He is arrested by the police for her murder. After Hatchi&#x27;s death, Karma inherits her company as the only eligible relative of age and effectively becomes a billionaire.

Karma later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside Elixir, Madison Jeffries, Masque, Random, and Boom-Boom, seeking peace in the former X-Men&#x27;s base at Utopia.

===&quot;Dead Souls&quot;===
In the &quot;New Mutants: Dead Souls&quot; miniseries, Karma enlists the aid of former new mutants Magik, Rictor, Wolfsbane and Boom-Boom plus Strong Guy to investigate a paranormal threat, using the Hatchi Corporation resources and influence at her disposal. In fact, Karma&#x27;s brother, Tran Cao Mạnh, believed to be long dead when absorbed by Karma, is revealed to have existed as a psychic being and sought revenge against his sister. During the confrontation, Karma, along with Magik, Strong Guy and Wolfsbane, were infected by Warlock&#x27;s techno-organic virus and absorbed into a Phalanx-like construct, which had already infected and absorbed Mirage, in a bizarre attempt for survival and to recreate the likenesses of Warlock&#x27;s allies in the New Mutants.

===&quot;X-Men Disassembled&quot;===

After most of the X-Men were jaunted to the Age of X-Man due to the calamitous actions of Nate Grey, Karma had been pressed into the services of O*N*E while under the effects of Warlock&#x27;s techno-organic infection. She, along with Mirage, Magik, Wolfsbane, Havok and Multiple Man, were rescued by Cyclops and Wolverine and helped re-form the X-Men. Karma still felt extreme guilt over her harmful actions from &quot;New Mutants: Dead Souls&quot; and ultimately resigned from the team after confiding in Mirage.

====&quot;War of the Realms&quot;====

Karma aided the X-Men when Mirage rallied forces to resist the incursions of Malekith, who had launched his final campaign against Earth during his inter-realm war.

====Krakoa====

When most of the world&#x27;s mutant population established themselves on Krakoa during the Dawn of X, Karma participated in the New Mutants&#x27; missions to space, and Carnelia.

==Powers and abilities==
Karma is a mutant telepath and empath with the ability to take possession of the minds and process the emotions of people and animals. She projects a psionic energy surge that overwhelms the consciousness of another sentient mind; rendering the victim unconscious while placing her own anima in command. It allows her to alter the victim&#x27;s perceptions and memories, will people to fall asleep or divulge information, and operate their bodies as if they were an extension of her own.

Formerly when Karma first took possession of someone, she could only move her subject&#x27;s body awkwardly until she acclimated herself to her new host. If she remained in possession of a host for too long she would begin to think and act as her host would, and eventually her own personality would become subordinate to one identical to the host&#x27;s. Although Karma can possess multiple subjects simultaneously, her control over her subjects is fragmented as she shifts her attention from one to another.

Karma had also begun developing other telepathic abilities that were either latent or triggered by her possession by the Shadow King. By possessing others remotely, she can mentally &quot;see&quot; through their eyes. She is also able to use her power to disrupt other psi-signatures, protecting her from all manner of psychic assault. She is also an avid illusionist, able to combine powers with Moonstar in order to throw up a convincing mirage that could fool even Sabretooth&#x27;s keen senses.

Karma is also a capable combatant with medieval weapons (particularly swords), due to the extended period of time she spent in Asgard. She is also familiar with first aid and firearms owing to her time in Vietnam. Shan would soon come to access the Hatchi Corporation heralded by her late half-sister, giving her access to multi-billion dollar resources in weapons tech amongst other utilities.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse ===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, Karma is Angel&#x27;s assistant, helping him manage his nightclub Heaven, and keeping a neutral stance in the civil war between Apocalypse&#x27;s loyal followers, openly resistant mutants, and the human population. Part of Karma&#x27;s job is to use her mental powers to gather information from their guests, and also to make sure none would remember anything suspicious they might have witnessed. Eventually, Karma is kidnapped by Apocalypse&#x27;s troops to be interrogated on matters regarding the X-Men. Karma keeps quiet as long as she can, but when the Shadow King is released on her, she gives away the desired information. She is then discarded outside Apocalypse&#x27;s stronghold.

Learning of his assistant&#x27;s fate, Angel searches for her. He is blinded by rage at the time, and when an Infinite guard calls out to him, he shoots the guard with his gun. Too late, though, he recognizes the guard&#x27;s voice as Karma&#x27;s. As he pulls her dying body from the suit of armor, she apologizes for having let him down.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, Karma is a member of Danielle Moonstar&#x27;s Cadre who serve as hunters for Fortress X. In this universe, she sports a mechanical leg.

===Days of Future Past===
In the &quot;Days of Future Tense&quot; continuity, inspired by the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, Karma is part of Pete Wisdom&#x27;s resistance force in Great Britain in the year 2013. She only answers to her codename, and has apparently suffered terrible losses. Trying to cope with her situation, Karma displays a dark sense of humor and has refined her powers to the point where she can perceive things through a person&#x27;s eyes without really possessing him or her.

===House of M===
In the House of M reality, Karma is a teacher at the New Mutant Leadership Institute. She is officially noted with S.H.I.E.L.D. for her pro-human sentiments, an unpopular opinion with the mutant ruling class. Karma and Cypher discover Laurie Collins and Sean Garrison are really working for S.H.I.E.L.D. as double agents and Tag takes him down before he tries to kill them.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Xuân Cao Mạnh is seen as a much darker character, working as one of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Black Ops agents, codename: Karma. She is called in by Nick Fury to find out whether or not the President was being mind-controlled by Charles Xavier, based on his recent pro-mutant stand. Upon the request of the President, she is added as the final member of the government sponsored New Mutants to observe the group. She is later instrumental in gaining evidence against a high-ranking government official who is the head of the anti-mutant conspiracy, arresting both high-ranking officials involved in attacks on the &#x27;New Mutants&#x27; on the Capitol steps. Whenever she uses her powers, her eyes glow a dark pink color.

===X-Men: The End===
Karma is seen fighting alongside the X-Men when Warskrulls invade the mansion.

==In other media==
=== Television ===
* Karma makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Beyond Good and Evil (Part 4): End and Beginning&quot; as one of Apocalypse&#x27;s prisoners.

<doc id="719829" wikidata="Q7315723" url="?curid=719829" title="Resolver (Veruca Salt album)">
<text>Resolver is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Veruca Salt. It was released on May 16, 2000, on Beyond Records, followed by an Australian release on December 6, 2002. The album was the first for the band after the departure of all the founding members but Louise Post, who became the band&#x27;s sole frontwoman. 

Like their previous album, &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, the title is inspired by The Beatles; in this case, a play on the title of their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;.

==Production==
The album was produced by Brian Liesegang.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Resolver&quot; is the album &quot;in which Post and Veruca Salt blow past the years of snide hipster innuendo that somehow they just weren&#x27;t good enough, a pop concoction cashing in on a trend (female-fronted alternative-rock bands) with a formulaic, bubblegum version of a once-revolutionary sound (the soft-loud dynamics, whispered verses and raging choruses of the Pixies, Nirvana and the Breeders).&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that &quot;what distinguishes &quot;Resolver&quot; is not a new style but a newfound consistency. Track for track, this is the band&#x27;s catchiest album.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Louise Post, except where noted.

<text>Taichung County was a county in central Taiwan between 1945 and 2010. The county seat was in Yuanlin Township before 1950 and Fongyuan City after 1950.

==History==
Taichung County was established on 26 November 1945 on the territory of Taichū Prefecture () shortly after the end of World War II. In the early years, Taichung County consists of most territory of Taichū Prefecture except the territory near cities of Taichū (Taichung) and Shōka (Changhua). The county is subdivide into districts (), which is reformed from Japanese districts (). The districts are divided into townships.

On 16 August 1950, another division reform was implemented. The southern part of the county was separated and established Changhua County and Nantou County. The remaining Taichung County has territory equivalent to the Toyohara (Fengyüan), Tōsei (Tungshih), Taikō (Tachia), and Daiton (Tatun) in the Japanese era. In addition, districts in the remaining part of Taichung County was defunct. All townships were directly controlled by the County Government. On 25 December 2010, the county merged with Taichung City to form a larger single special municipality.

== Administration ==
The subdivisions of the County remained mostly stable between 1950 and 2010. However, some changed has also been made.
* 1 Oct 1955, Neipu Township () was renamed Houli Township ()
* 7 Jun 1973, two northeast most villages in Hoping Township () was separated to form a new county-level division — Lishan Constructing Administrative Bureau ().
* 1 Mar 1973, Fengyuan () reformed from an urban township to a county-administered city for its population.
* 18 Feb 1982, Lishan Constructing Administrative Bureau dissolved, the two villages returned to Hoping Township.
* 1 Nov 1993, Tali () reformed from a rural township to a county-administered city for its population.
* 1 Aug 1996, Taiping () reformed from a rural township to a county-administered city for its population.
In 25 Dec 2010, The county was merged with Taichung City, all cities and townships became districts. On the eve of merging with Taichung City, the county consists of the following administrative divisions

<doc id="719845" wikidata="Q141458" url="?curid=719845" title="Trapezohedron">
<text>In geometry, an trapezohedron, -trapezohedron, -antidipyramid, -antibipyramid, or -deltohedron is the dual polyhedron of an antiprism. The faces of an are congruent and symmetrically staggered; they are called &quot;twisted kites&quot;. With a higher symmetry, its faces are &quot;kites&quot; (sometimes also called &quot;trapezoids&quot;, or &quot;deltoids&quot;).

The &quot;&quot; part of the name does not refer to faces here, but to two arrangements of each vertices around an axis of symmetry. The dual antiprism has two actual faces.

An trapezohedron can be dissected into two equal pyramids and an antiprism.

==Terminology==
These figures, sometimes called deltohedra, are not to be confused with deltahedra, whose faces are equilateral triangles.

&quot;Twisted&quot; &quot;trigonal&quot;, &quot;tetragonal&quot;, and &quot;hexagonal trapezohedra&quot; (with six, eight, and twelve &quot;twisted&quot; congruent kite faces) exist as crystals; in crystallography (describing the crystal habits of minerals), they are just called &quot;trigonal&quot;, &quot;tetragonal&quot;, and &quot;hexagonal trapezohedra&quot;. They have no plane of symmetry, and no center of inversion symmetry;, but they have a center of symmetry: the intersection point of their symmetry axes. The trigonal trapezohedron has one 3-fold symmetry axis, perpendicular to three 2-fold symmetry axes. The tetragonal trapezohedron has one 4-fold symmetry axis, perpendicular to four 2-fold symmetry axes of two kinds. The hexagonal trapezohedron has one 6-fold symmetry axis, perpendicular to six 2-fold symmetry axes of two kinds.

Crystal arrangements of atoms can repeat in space with trigonal and hexagonal trapezohedron cells.

Also in crystallography, the word &quot;trapezohedron&quot; is often used for the polyhedron with 24 congruent non-twisted kite faces properly known as a &quot;deltoidal icositetrahedron&quot;, which has eighteen order-4 vertices and eight order-3 vertices. This is not to be confused with the &quot;dodecagonal trapezohedron&quot;, which also has 24 congruent kite faces, but two order-12 apices (i.e. poles) and two rings of twelve order-3 vertices each.

Still in crystallography, the &quot;deltoid dodecahedron&quot; has 12 congruent non-twisted kite faces, six order-4 vertices and eight order-3 vertices (the &quot;rhombic dodecahedron&quot; is a special case). This is not to be confused with the &quot;hexagonal trapezohedron&quot;, which also has 12 congruent kite faces, but two order-6 apices (i.e. poles) and two rings of six order-3 vertices each.

==Forms==
An -trapezohedron is defined by a regular zig-zag skew -gon base, two symmetric apices with no degree of freedom right above and right below the base, and quadrilateral faces connecting each pair of adjacent basal edges to one apex.

An -trapezohedron has two apical vertices on its polar axis, and basal vertices in two regular -gonal rings. It has congruent kite faces, and it is isohedral.

=== Special cases ===
* . A degenerate form of trapezohedron: a geometric figure with 6 vertices, 8 edges, and 4 degenerate kite faces that are visually identical to triangles. As such, the trapezohedron itself is visually identical to the regular tetrahedron. Its dual is a degenerate form of antiprism that also resembles the regular tetrahedron.

* . The dual of a &quot;triangular antiprism&quot;: the kites are rhombi (or squares); hence these trapezohedra are also zonohedra. They are called rhombohedra. They are cubes scaled in the direction of a body diagonal. They are also the parallelepipeds with congruent rhombic faces.
** A special case of a rhombohedron is one in which the rhombi forming the faces have angles of and . It can be decomposed into two equal regular tetrahedra and a regular octahedron. Since parallelepipeds can fill space, so can a combination of regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra.

* . The pentagonal trapezohedron is the only polyhedron other than the Platonic solids commonly used as a die in roleplaying games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Being convex and face-transitive, it makes fair dice. Having 10 sides, it can be used in repetition to generate any decimal-based uniform probability desired. Typically, two dice of different colors are used for the two digits to represent numbers from to .

==Symmetry==
The symmetry group of an -gonal trapezohedron is , of order , except in the case of : a cube has the larger symmetry group of order , which has four versions of as subgroups.

The rotation group of an -trapezohedron is , of order , except in the case of : a cube has the larger rotation group of order , which has four versions of as subgroups.

Note: Every -trapezohedron with a regular zig-zag skew -gon base and congruent non-twisted kite faces has the same (dihedral) symmetry group as the dual-uniform -trapezohedron, for .

One degree of freedom within symmetry from (order ) to (order ) changes the congruent kites into congruent quadrilaterals with three edge lengths, called &quot;twisted kites&quot;, and the -trapezohedron is called a &quot;twisted trapezohedron&quot;. (In the limit, one edge of each quadrilateral goes to zero length, and the -trapezohedron becomes an -bipyramid.)

If the kites surrounding the two peaks are not twisted but are of two different shapes, the -trapezohedron can only have (cyclic with vertical mirrors) symmetry, order , and is called an &quot;unequal&quot; or &quot;asymmetric trapezohedron&quot;. Its dual is an &quot;unequal -antiprism&quot;, with the top and bottom -gons of different radii.

If the kites are twisted and are of two different shapes, the -trapezohedron can only have (cyclic) symmetry, order , and is called an &quot;unequal twisted trapezohedron&quot;.

==Star trapezohedron==
A star -trapezohedron (where ) is defined by a regular zig-zag skew star -gon base, two symmetric apices with no degree of freedom right above and right below the base, and quadrilateral faces connecting each pair of adjacent basal edges to one apex.

A star -trapezohedron has two apical vertices on its polar axis, and basal vertices in two regular -gonal rings. It has congruent kite faces, and it is isohedral.

Such a star -trapezohedron is a &quot;self-intersecting&quot;, &quot;crossed&quot;, or &quot;non-convex&quot; form. It exists for any regular zig-zag skew star -gon base (where ).

But if , then , so the dual star antiprism (of the star trapezohedron) cannot be uniform (i.e. cannot have equal edge lengths); and if , then , so the dual star antiprism must be flat, thus degenerate, to be uniform.

A dual-uniform star -trapezohedron has Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .

<doc id="719846" wikidata="Q721263" url="?curid=719846" title="Richard Riordan">
<text>Richard Joseph Riordan (May 1, 1930 – April 19, 2023) was an American businessman, investor, military commander, philanthropist, and politician. A decorated Korean War veteran and a member of the Republican Party, Riordan served as the 39th mayor of Los Angeles from 1993 to 2001; he remains the most recent Republican to hold that office. He ran for governor in the 2002 California gubernatorial election, losing the Republican primary. After politics, he resumed his business career, specializing in private equity.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Riordan was born in Flushing, Queens, to an Irish-American family, the son of Geraldine (Doyle) and William O. Riordan. He was the youngest of their nine children. After growing up in New Rochelle, New York, he first enrolled at Santa Clara University on a football scholarship, but transferred to Princeton University, where he graduated in 1952 with an A.B. in philosophy. His senior thesis was titled &quot;A Study of the Thomistic Faculty Psychology.&quot; He then served in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant during the Korean War. After leaving the military, he earned a J.D. from The University of Michigan Law School in 1956.

That year, he moved to Los Angeles, joining the downtown law firm of O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers. In 1959, he left to become a partner of Nossaman LLP. In 1975, he was a founding partner of the law firm Riordan &amp; McKinzie, which merged with Bingham McCutchen in 2003.

Riordan began investing in the 1950s with an $80,000 inheritance from his father, which he eventually grew into a multimillion dollar fortune. In 1982, he was a founder of the private equity firm Riordan, Lewis &amp; Haden. As a philanthropist, he founded the Riordan Foundation, a charity for expanding childhood literacy.

== Mayor of Los Angeles ==

When Tom Bradley announced he was retiring as Mayor of Los Angeles, Riordan set his sights on the 1993 election. Riordan won with 54% of the vote, becoming the first Republican mayor in 36 years. As Mayor, the heavily Democratic Los Angeles City Council blocked many of his proposals, or they proved unfeasible in reality. For example, the police academy did not have enough classroom space or instructors to train as many new police officers as Riordan had initially promised. He streamlined certain business regulations and established &quot;one-stop&quot; centers around the city for services, like permit applications.

Riordan feuded with police chief Daryl Gates&#x27; successor, former Philadelphia police commissioner Willie Williams, but oversaw a general decline in city crime. Ultimately, Riordan replaced Williams with LAPD veteran Bernard Parks in 1997, the year he was re-elected mayor over California State Senator Tom Hayden.

Riordan&#x27;s tenure was marked by controversy over the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s Red Line subway&#x27;s construction cost overruns. Because the overruns resulted in MTA funds being reallocated from bus funding, the Bus Riders Union sued the city, alleging racial discrimination, resulting in a 1996 consent decree that eviscerated MTA funding for subway and light rail construction projects. Riordan publicly stated that he regretted signing the consent decree and it was his biggest mistake as mayor.

Before becoming mayor, Riordan spearheaded the city&#x27;s successful term limit ballot initiative and he was therefore term-limited from office in 2001. Riordan endorsed his adviser and friend, Steve Soboroff, to succeed him. Soboroff, however, came in third in the non-partisan mayoral primary election. Former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa advanced to the runoff against James Hahn. Riordan endorsed Villaraigosa in the second round, but Hahn won and succeeded him as mayor. Four years later, Villaraigosa defeated Hahn in the 2005 rematch and became Mayor.

== 2002 California gubernatorial race ==
In 2002, Riordan decided to seek the governorship. In the Republican primary election, he faced conservative businessman Bill Simon and former California Secretary of State Bill Jones. Although Riordan had a 30-point lead early in the race, Simon beat him by 18 points. Riordan&#x27;s loss mainly can be attributed to a conservative Republican party base that rejected his moderate Republicanism and efforts to move the party to the political center. Incumbent Democratic Governor Gray Davis felt he had a much better chance to beat Simon, so he spent millions of dollars running attack ads against Riordan in the Republican primary. Davis&#x27;s cross-party strategy was successful. Riordan lost the primary, and Davis defeated Simon 47%–42% in the general election.

==&quot;The Los Angeles Examiner&quot;==
In early 2003, Riordan circulated a prototype of a locally-focused, sophisticated, and politically-independent weekly newspaper, &quot;The Los Angeles Examiner,&quot; he hoped to start publishing in June. It was, however, never published. Riordan put the project on hold when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who defeated Grey Davis in the October 2003 recall election, appointed him California Secretary of Education. He served in the position from 2003 until he resigned in 2005.

== Later political involvement ==
Riordan continued to be involved in city politics after his mayoralty. In the 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election, Riordan endorsed his friend and adviser Steve Soboroff in the primary and Antonio Villaraigosa in the general election. In 2005, he backed former State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg in the primary and Antonio Villaraigosa in the general election. In both races, he chose not to endorse James Hahn.

Riordan played a role in City Council elections, supporting Bill Rosendahl, who won election in the Eleventh District in 2005; Monica Rodriguez, who lost to Seventh District Councilman Richard Alarcon in 2007; and Adeena Bleich, who lost to Paul Koretz and David Vahedi, who advanced to the runoff election. In 2013, Riordan endorsed Wendy Greuel for mayor. She ultimately was defeated by then-Council member Eric Garcetti.

==Personal life and legacy==
The Richard J. Riordan Central Library in Los Angeles is named after him. Riordan owned the Original Pantry Cafe, which has operated in Los Angeles since 1924, and Gladstones Malibu, which has been open since 1972.

Riordan was married four times and had five children, two of whom predeceased him. He died at home in Brentwood on April 19, 2023, at age 92.

<text>Illyana Nikolaievna Rasputina (Russian: Ильяна Николаевна Распутина) is a fictional character, a comic superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in the &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). llyana Rasputin is a member of a fictional species of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities, and has also possessed magical abilities as well, as a result of her interactions with the demonic supervillain Belasco. She is known under the codename Magik.

llyana Rasputin is the younger sister of the Russian X-Men member Colossus and X-Men enemy Mikhail Rasputin. She became a powerful sorceress due to her time imprisoned in (and later ruling) Limbo. Her mutant power, which first manifested in that Limbo, is the ability to teleport via stepping discs utilizing that dimension&#x27;s magic. Following her escape from Limbo, she became part of the New Mutants. She later joined the X-Men. In 2024, she got her own ongoing series written by Ashley Allen with art by Germán Peralta.

The character has been featured in various Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Anya Taylor-Joy portrayed Illyana Rasputin in the 2020 film &quot;The New Mutants&quot;.

==Publication history==
llyana Rasputin debuted in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975), created by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum. Her first name was not revealed until &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #145 (May 1981). For the first eight years of the character&#x27;s existence, she was an infrequently appearing background character known as Colossus&#x27; little sister. The means of changing this was set in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #160 (August 1982), in which she ages seven years while in a paranormal dimension called Limbo, becomes a sorceress, and develops the mutant ability to create &quot;teleportation discs.&quot; These changes were not immediately explored or explained, and for the next year she remained essentially a background character.

In December 1983, the limited series &quot;Magik (Illyana and Storm)&quot; was launched, chronicling Illyana&#x27;s years in Limbo, which is also her origin story. &quot;Magik&quot; #1 (December 1983) is her first cover appearance as young Illyana, her second full appearance and the first time she get the name Magik. &quot;Magik&quot; #2 (Jan. 1984) is her first cover appearance as adult Magik. Immediately following the end of the series, she was added to the cast of the New Mutants, appearing regularly in that comic from &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #14 (April 1984), the first cover appearance of adult Magik in costume, to &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #77 (July 1989), in which she returns to her family in Russia after having reverted to childhood. As the younger sister of Colossus and a member of the New Mutants, she also sporadically appeared as a guest star in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #303 (1993), she dies of the Legacy Virus.

==Fictional character biography==
Illyana Rasputin (born Illyana Nikolaievna Rasputina) was born in the Ust-Ordynski Collective farm, near Lake Baikal, Siberia, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union to Nikolai Rasputin and his wife Alexandra Natalya Rasputina. The 2006 comic mini-series &quot;Colossus: Bloodline&quot; established that the family was descended from Grigori Rasputin and a Romani woman named Elena. Illyana&#x27;s two older brothers, Mikhail Nikolaievitch Rasputin and Colossus (Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Nikolaievitch Rasputin) are also mutants. Colossus&#x27; superhuman powers manifest while saving Illyana from a runaway tractor.
At six years old, Illyana is abducted and brought to the United States by Arcade, who uses her and several other hostages to coerce the X-Men into opposing Doctor Doom. She is rescued and brought back to the X-Mansion.

Shortly thereafter, Illyana is called to the Limbo dimension by Belasco, who seeks to bring forth the Elder Gods to rule Earth. She is raised there, frequently bullied and tormented by Belasco&#x27;s underling S&#x27;ym. To free himself, Belasco needs to fill the Beatrix Medallion with five bloodstones. The bloodstones are created by corrupting Illyana&#x27;s soul, with a new stone appearing as her corruption deepens. She is rescued and tutored in the practice of white magic by that dimension&#x27;s version of Storm (who turned to magic when her mutant powers waned). Finding the use of magic abhorrent, Limbo&#x27;s version of Shadowcat, known as Cat, kidnaps and trains Illyana in hand to hand and sword combat. Cat, along with Illyana, storms Belasco&#x27;s citadel. They are overwhelmed by Belasco who further transforms Cat into a feline demonic creature. With Illyana back under his control, Belasco instructs her in the art of black magic in the hopes that it will further corrupt her soul. However, Illyana plots Belasco&#x27;s defeat and continues to resist the dark influence on her soul. Illyana forms a mystical bond between both Storm and Cat, who were also tutored by Belasco.

Belasco succeeds in creating three parts of Illyana&#x27;s bloodstone pendant. Illyana creates the Soulsword and takes over Limbo as its new ruler. While wielding the Soulsword she manifests horns, a tail and fangs. She banishes Belasco from Limbo and claims S&#x27;ym as her servant. She then returns to Earth a decade older, although no time has passed on Earth since her kidnapping. She subsequently joins the New Mutants.

Magik misguides one of her teleportation discs through the space-time continuum and strands herself and Mirage in ancient Egypt. There, Illyana meets Storm&#x27;s ancestor Ashake, an Egyptian priestess. Together, they defeat an evil sorcerer, Heka-Nut, who sought an ancient mystical sword called the Sword of Bone using Magik&#x27;s Soulsword. Ashake helps Illyana and Mirage return to the present, with Mirage&#x27;s memory of the incident erased in the process.

A strange armor begins to appear on her body each time she wields the Soulsword. The armor appears only on one of her shoulders and arms at first, but appears on more of her body each time that she wields the sword. Illyana&#x27;s skill as a sorceress grows, and she battles other beings with mystical powers such as Baba Yaga, the Enchantress, Forge, Spiral, and Heka-Nut. A routine trip through Limbo goes awry, leaving the New Mutants stuck in Limbo. To open an escape route for her teammates, Illyana embraces her demonic nature and opens a colossal teleportation disc between Earth and Limbo, which N&#x27;astirh holds open, triggering an invasion of Earth by demons from Limbo. Ashamed of herself, she flees into Limbo, and decides to end the demonic invasion by assuming rule of Limbo. However, her teammate Rahne Sinclair persuades her against this, and she instead gives up her demonic powers by creating a massive stepping disc that banishes the demons back to Limbo, then throws her Soulsword in after them to seal the portal shut. Afterwards, the New Mutants find a seven-year-old Illyana inside the husk of her eldritch armor. She still possesses the bloodstone locket.

Because of the mystic bond she shares with the Shadowcat from the Limbo dimension, the Soulsword passes on to Earth&#x27;s Shadowcat in England. It embeds itself in a stone near Excalibur&#x27;s lighthouse headquarters, waiting for Shadowcat to claim it and become its new wielder. After a conflict with the necromancer Gravemoss, the Soulsword is acquired by Amanda Sefton, who would claim Illyana&#x27;s mantle as Magik, ruler of Limbo and wielder of the Soulsword.

Illyana returns to Russia where she lives with her parents for some months until they are murdered by the Russian government to secure Illyana&#x27;s abilities to defeat a psionic being known as the Soul Skinner. Illyana then returns to the X-Mansion to live with her brother and the other X-Men.

Not long afterwards, Illyana contracts the Legacy Virus, and dies in the X-Mansion, despite all efforts to save her made by Charles Xavier and Moira MacTaggert.

Illyana&#x27;s spirit returns to Colossus, who had recently returned to the United States with Shadowcat and Nightcrawler following the disbanding of Excalibur. When investigating odd occurrences inside the Mansion, Colossus locates one of the stepping disks that Illyana had magically bound to the school. He is transported to a pocket world, which holds a memory imprint of Illyana. Illyana&#x27;s memory convinces him to make one final sacrifice. When the cure for the Legacy Virus turned out to need the death of one mutant, he secretly gave his life, so nobody else would have to die like Illyana did. Colossus is later resurrected by an alien race.

Belasco eventually deposes Amanda Sefton and, after seeing Illyana reappear during the 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; and realizing he carries a torch for her, creates a powerful spell to return her to him. The spell pulls forth the remaining essence of Illyana still held within Limbo&#x27;s dimension, taking shape as the Darkchilde, the semi-demonic version of Illyana corrupted and transformed by dark magic. Belasco is not satisfied with his creation, claiming that it is not the true Illyana Rasputin (due to her lack of Illyana&#x27;s soul) and banishes her to the outer parts of Limbo.

Illyana, now with her Darkchilde persona, discovers some of the teenage New X-Men being attacked by a horde of demons. After aiding the mutants against the demons, she uses a spell to immobilize them and steal a portion of Pixie&#x27;s soul, in the hopes of creating both a bloodstone and a new Soulsword, as Illyana felt Pixie had the most innocent of souls present. Anole breaks free from Illyana&#x27;s confinement and dispatches her. Pixie&#x27;s soul extraction is partially successful however, creating one part of a bloodstone pendant and a soul dagger. Illyana attempts to complete the process and destroy those who wished to interfere, but Rockslide thwarts her, and causes Illyana&#x27;s human memories of her friends and life among the X-Men to return to her.

Although only a part of Pixie&#x27;s soul was taken, Pixie is now capable of performing magic, the hole in her soul having been filled with black magic. Since Belasco had sealed his castle from her own magic and powers, Illyana teaches Pixie a teleportation spell, with which the New X-Men attack and defeat Belasco.

Illyana succumbs to her Darkchilde persona and announces her desire to create several more bloodstones to become god-like in power. She is interrupted by the arrival of Colossus, investigating Illyana&#x27;s apparent return to life. A pained Illyana rejects her brother&#x27;s offers of help, and sends everyone back to Earth, before reclaiming Limbo&#x27;s throne and informing S&#x27;ym and N&#x27;astirh, now once more her servants, that her next move is to reclaim her soul. Motivated by her friendship with Shadowcat and love for Colossus, Illyana tries to reclaim her soul through love and teleports to the Xavier Institute, only to find it destroyed and abandoned.
While in Limbo, Illyana attacks various demons in her search for the Bloodstone amulet. Her activities are noticed by Mephisto, Blackheart, Satannish, Dormammu and Hela. Belasco&#x27;s daughter, Witchfire appears during the meeting and reveals she is the current owner of Illyana&#x27;s Bloodstone amulet and vows to take her father&#x27;s place as ruler of Limbo. Back at the X-Men&#x27;s base in San Francisco, Pixie accidentally discovers Magik&#x27;s Soulsword is hidden inside Nightcrawler. Sensing its presence, Illyana teleports in and reclaims her sword, transforming from the Darkchilde into her Magik persona. She strikes Colossus when he enters the Danger Room and calls out to her, realizing that something is wrong when she does not feel any emotions, and returns to Limbo. Witchfire has conquered Limbo and Magik&#x27;s armies during her absence. Claiming everything that Belasco ever owned, Witchfire captures Magik, takes her bloodstone and adds it to the amulet.

The X-Men arrive at the castle; Nightcrawler finds Illyana chained to a pillar. At her direction, he stabs her with Pixie&#x27;s soul dagger, re-releasing the Soulsword inside of her. Witchfire completes the set of Bloodstones via another portion of Pixie&#x27;s soul and releases the Elder Gods. Illyana and the other mutants hold back Witchfire and the Elder Gods. Using a combination of magic and the powers of the Soulsword and Souldagger, Illyana and Pixie remove one of Pixie&#x27;s bloodstones. The Elder Gods are swept back to their dimension, along with Witchfire and the remaining bloodstones. Pixie&#x27;s Souldagger merges with the bloodstone that was pried loose by Ilyana. Saddened by the loss of her and Pixie&#x27;s remaining bloodstones, Illyana teleports the mutants back to the X-Base, and they convince her to stay with them.

However, the younger mutants are still very distrustful of her. Illyana seems to have undergone a personality change since her return from the future, becoming more detached emotionally in most cases, possibly due to the further loss of most of her soul.

Later, Cyclops sends Illyana to team up (unknowingly) with X-Force to locate Wolverine and teleport them to Alcatraz to rescue any mutants taken prisoner by Norman Osborn&#x27;s forces. Along with Pixie, they teleport all the X-Men from San Francisco to their new home, Utopia.

When Hope Summers and Cable return to the present during the 2010 &quot;X-Men: Second Coming&quot; storyline, Bastion begins eliminating all mutant teleporters to trap the mutant population on Utopia. While trying to bring Hope and Cable to Utopia, Illyana is fired upon by one of the Purifiers with a supernatural weapon that opens a portal to Limbo that she cannot control; she is drawn into the portal by a cluster of demonic tentacles. She is eventually freed from her restraints by Pixie, and Illyana and her rescue team return to Earth.

In a reversal of fortune, Pixie is kidnapped by Project Purgatory, and Magik returns to Limbo with the New Mutants to rescue her. While in Limbo, the New Mutants encounter the &quot;Inferno Babies&quot; - mutants who were taken as infants by the government and raised and trained in Limbo. This now-adult team attacks and overwhelms the New Mutants. While the rest of the team is captured, Magik escapes to Earth with Karma and Pixie. After hiding the Soulsword inside Karma, Magik teleports the rest of the X-Men to Portal Epsilon, Project Purgatory&#x27;s gateway to Limbo, for what the X-Men believe to be a rescue mission. They arrive just as Limbo&#x27;s Elder Gods breach the gateway to Earth. Karma releases Legion&#x27;s mind with the soulsword, freeing him to use his powers to destroy the Elder Gods and return the bloodstones belonging to Magik and Pixie, thus restoring their souls. Confronted by Cyclops afterward, Magik admits to putting the world in danger and manipulating the X-Men for the sake of a personal vendetta against the Elder Gods. Cyclops decides that she must be restrained. While she remains unrepentant, she accepts his decision.

Magik is placed in the X-Brig 2, a newly constructed, ultra-high security prison 500 ft. below sea level. She is controlled by devices that detect and prevent the use of teleportation and magic. During a visit Magik accepts the blame for her incarceration when Colossus tries to comfort her. Magik is temporarily released by Colossus and Kitty to get her help in defeating Juggernaut.

Following the events of Schism, Magik is selected to be a member of Cyclops&#x27; &quot;Extinction Team.&quot; Despite this status, she remains a prisoner. She is only released from the X-Brig for missions, and while in the field, her suit contains lethal fail-safes that prevent her escape.

Illyana is chosen as one of the &quot;Phoenix Five,&quot; a group of X-Men granted additional powers by the Phoenix Force. After Ms. Marvel is defeated by Rogue, Magik appears and gags the Avenger before teleporting her into Limbo, trapping her and terrifying Rogue. Following the defeat of Cyclops, Magik and the other former members of the Phoenix Five are reported to have fled. Magik joins Cyclops&#x27; team of X-Men at the New Xavier School at the old Weapon X facility. The Phoenix apparently has damaged Magik&#x27;s powers, like it apparently did to the other five; Illyana initially thinks her ability to channel increased energies from Limbo is a power upgrade, but Dormammu pulls her into Limbo, and demonstrates that her newfound ability to effortlessly summon Limbo energies is destroying Limbo. Dormammu later pulls the entire Uncanny team into Limbo, intending to kill them in front of Magik before he kills her. They fight back and Illyana absorbs all of Limbo&#x27;s mystic energy, causing it and its creatures to disappear. She sends the X-Men back to Earth, and travels back through time to become the protégé of a past version of Doctor Strange, explaining that she needs a greater understanding of magic, so as to better control her mutant powers.

It is eventually discovered that Magik along with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magneto and Colossus were actually infected with nano-sentinels by Dark Beast, after the incident with the Phoenix Force, and that was the real cause for their broken powers or sudden upgrade. She has since regained total control over her powers and was able to recreate Limbo.

She later helps Doctor Strange defeat the Empirikul, a science cult focused on destroying magic in every dimension.

Magik is employed by Karma to lead a new New Mutants team along with Wolfsbane, Rictor, Strong Guy, Prodigy and Boom-Boom.

When an eco-terrorist group attempted to use the Man-Thing as a weapon against humanity, the part of Ted Sallis within the creature attempted to stop the threat by summoning the demon lord Belasco, who he had previously made a deal with to gain the insight necessary to crack the super-soldier serum. Instead, this ritual summoned Illyana, who offered to release Sallis from the Man-Thing with the warning that this would leave Man-Thing a creature of instinct who could endanger the world. Sallis accepted that he had to remain in Man-Thing, but Illyana not only helped stop the group that had unleashed Man-Thing as a weapon, but later summoned Belasco so that Sallis could punish the demon for his role in Sallis&#x27;s fall.

===Dawn of X===
After the formation of the mutant sovereign state of Krakoa, Magik is granted the rank of Captain in the Quiet Council. She joins Sunspot and the other New Mutants in travelling to Shi&#x27;ar space, aboard the Starjammers vessel, to locate Sunspot&#x27;s best friend Cannonball. Magik and the rest of the New Mutants are arrested once the Starjammers arrive at a space station to rob a highly valued object, having been believed to be behind the attempted thievery. The New Mutants are quickly bailed out by Cannonball&#x27;s wife, Smasher, under the order that they are to protect Deathbird in transit to the Shi&#x27;ar homeworld to instruct her niece in the way of rule. The team was attacked by the Death Commandos who Oracle had ordered to keep Xandra of the throne, Magik excitedly defeated several of them all knowing she wasn&#x27;t human and therefore wasn&#x27;t in violation of Krakoa&#x27;s laws. With Deathbird&#x27;s help they defeated them all and took control of their ship. Once they arrived on Chandilar they ambushed Oracle for trying to have them killed leading to a fight between the New Mutants and the Imperial Guard. Xandra put a stop to the fight by announcing that Oracle and Deathbird will both be her mentors and the New Mutants left back to Krakoa. Sunspot staying behind to spend more time with Cannonball.

After this she went on many more missions with the New Mutants to bring more Mutants to Krakoa, and developed a fondness for teaching and mentoring, training the islands youth at the Akadamos Habitat, teaching Magic at Strange Academy, and forming her own version of the Dark Riders.

====&quot;X of Swords&quot;====
In the 2020 &quot;X of Swords&quot; storyline, Magik is one of nine Krakoan Mutants chosen by Saturnyne to fight against Krakoa&#x27;s sister island Arakko in a tournament in Otherworld. She prepares by training Cypher in swordfighting. In the tournament she is twice pitted against Pogg-Ur-Pogg. The first time is an arm wrestling match in which he easily beats her due to his Hulking strength. In their second fight, she outsmarts him by realizing &quot;Pogg&quot; means &quot;sword&quot; in Arakkii, and allowing him to swallow her so that she can pull the actual Pogg-Ur-Pogg, a tiny Goblin, out of his armor.

====The Labors of Magik====
Magik decides she does not want to balance her teaching jobs and being a captain of Krakoa while also being queen of Limbo. Wanting to transcend her traumatic past, she decides to distance herself from Limbo. Needing a new ruler for the demonic dimension, Magik (over the objections of her fellow New Mutants) offers the role to Madelyne Pryor based on her past connection to Limbo. And because, like Magik, she too has survived painfully traumatic experiences and is still a damaged soul. Illyana declares anyone normal and &quot;untouched by darkness&quot; to be ill-suited to rule Limbo. Due to their objections, Illyana offered to take Rahne and Dani with her to witness the handover of power. However, they were invaded by an army of demons led by S&#x27;ym, who wanted to take Limbo for himself and had his own weapon which was able to disarm Magik&#x27;s soulsword. The four women were forced to flee back to Krakoa but Magik&#x27;s portal failed and they found themselves stranded in a different part of Limbo. Magik found she could not teleport out of Limbo or summon her Soulsword and concluded S&#x27;ym must have destroyed it. Due to Limbo&#x27;s temporal nature, they discovered an older version of herself living in a castle and using Warlock in place of her Soulsword. She revealed to them that she had been trapped in Limbo for many years fighting Technarchy-infected Demons and she and Warlock were the last two Mutants alive. She got a message from the demons offering her safe passage home for herself and her friends on the condition that she leaves her weaker older self. The two Magik&#x27;s laugh in the demons face. The next day, the whole horde of demons comes in giving the younger Illyana one more chance to accept their offer. Instead, the older Illyana made her own offer - a one on one, winner takes all fight with their leader S&#x27;ym. To everyone&#x27;s shock he agrees. He seems to get the upper hand but immediately after he stabs her, she reveals she is bonded to Warlock and used the stab to remove the techno-organic virus from S&#x27;ym and his allies. After watching her defeat S&#x27;ym once and for all, the team went further into Limbo, finding themselves in a fairytale world based on Alice in Wonderland. They were ambushed by guards of the Red King (Belasco) and Magik was separated from the rest of the group. She was woken up by her younger self who was still Belasco&#x27;s apprentice. She told her where her friends were being held and performed a spell to summon someone who could help, bringing Colossus to them from Krakoa, much to the older Illyana&#x27;s dismay. Arriving at the Red King&#x27;s castle where the others were being held, Magik took great pleasure in defeating a weaker version of Belasco. In turn, this inspired the younger Illyana to undo her spell, turning the fairytale world back into Belasco&#x27;s castle. Illyana said goodbye to her younger self who was happy to know she would eventually become strong enough to escape and once again the group set forth further into Limbo. After months of waiting in a cave where she continued training Madelyne, the group stages an assault on the castle hoping to take Limbo back from S&#x27;ym. While initially successful, once they get inside the wall they realize S&#x27;ym is being helped by another version of Magik created by Limbo because the original spent to much time on Earth and neglected her duties. Magik allows her doppelganger to think she has the upper hand so Madelyne can defeat her while she is distracted. This causes the two to merge together making Illyana once again powerful enough to send them home. Madelyne to finally becoming the new Queen of Limbo.

===Blood Hunt===
During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Magik saves a Siberian village from a group of vampires led by a vampire version of Ilya Muromets.

==Powers and abilities==

=== Teleportation ===
Illyana Rasputin possesses the mutant ability to teleport herself and others through time and space from one location to another. She initially did this by summoning what she calls &quot;stepping discs,&quot; which were part of a dimension known as Limbo. When she calls for a stepping disc she has to use Limbo as a midway point before she can teleport to an alternate location. Rasputin has succeeded in teleporting herself across continents, from one continent to another, and even interplanetary and intergalactic distances on occasion. Unlike most teleporters in the Marvel Universe, she can teleport through time as well as space. She has teleported moments, days or centuries into the past or future. After Rasputin absorbed all of Limbo, the stepping discs ceased to exist; now when she teleports, hellish images of ghosts, dragons, or other supernatural creatures appear.

===Sorcery===

Illyana Rasputin is the sorceress supreme of her Limbo dimension. In Limbo, she is able to cast any magic spell that Belasco could, having had access to his store of sorcerous knowledge. Her sorcery is a unique mix of black magic and white magic. Belasco taught her Black magic, while she learned white magic from Ororo Munroe.

On Earth, Rasputin demonstrates astral projection, sensing mystical presences, scrying, and casting very simple spells. She uses magic of a seemingly greater strength than she could previously use in Earth&#x27;s dimension. Since absorbing Limbo and becoming Doctor Strange&#x27;s disciple, her magic on Earth has been considerably stronger, such as when she used spells she learned from Doctor Strange to destroy advanced Sentinels.

The more Rasputin uses her magical power, the more mystical armor appears on her body, in addition to demonic features such as horns and hooves. The armor deflects or limits attacks, both physical and magical. Her armor also provides protection from the Transmode Virus. The armor also provides Rasputin with superhuman strength, which she displayed by being able to toss the giant demon S&#x27;ym off of her several feet.

Rasputin created the Soulsword during her imprisonment in Limbo. She magically caused her own life force energy to manifest before her. Once this happened she cast her hand into a pool of eldritch energy and imagined a weapon in her mind. When she withdrew her hand she was holding the Soulsword, created from her own soul. A simple looking blade upon its origin, it develops intricate designs and forms upon itself the more Illyana uses it, becoming more powerful with each use.

Her Soulsword disrupts magical energies, constructs, and creatures. It also augments the power level of any magic user who holds it. The Soulsword generally has no physical effect, but disrupts even the most powerful magic as it passes through. Since Rasputin&#x27;s resurrection, the Soulsword seems to affect psychic beings like Legion&#x27;s personalities, whereas in the past the sword only affected magical creatures and spells. The only exception to this has been Kitty Pryde, who can still be cut by the Soulsword even when Pryde is using her phasing power to become intangible. Rasputin can make her Soulsword appear and vanish at will. After &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, she has used her Soulsword against physical beings, including a Sentinel.

===Other abilities===
Furthermore, Illyana Rasputin displays formidable psionic shields, which block anyone from reading her mind, even such powerful telepaths as Professor X, the Shadow King, and Rachel Summers. Since her revival, Rasputin is able to lower her psionic shields. Due to Belasco creating the magical bloodstones with their souls, Rasputin has a psychic bond with X-Man Kitty Pryde. Because of this, a similar connection could be considered between Rasputin and Storm.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Alex Schlesinger of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said that Illyana Rasputin has &quot;not only seen a meteoric rise to fame over the past decade, but also has the best long-term character arc of any hero in Marvel Comics,&quot; writing, &quot;Magik&#x27;s story powerfully shows that trauma is not necessary for growth or empowerment, but one can also not undo the trauma of their past. Instead, the path forward is to reconcile your past with your present and gain strength from the freedom you have desperately fought for. Magik&#x27;s story of heroic redemption, escape from abuse, and acceptance of one&#x27;s identity has given this X-Men fan-favorite the best character arc in Marvel Comics.&quot; Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Illyana Rasputin a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; referred to Illyana Rasputin as one of the X-Men&#x27;s most &quot;surprisingly popular characters,&quot; saying that Rasputin is a &quot;brave, dynamic character whose hope was crushed out of her by a much older man when she was only a child. The trauma she underwent is extreme, even by X-Men standards. Though she finds her ability to hope has been crushed, Illyana&#x27;s saving grace is that she does everything in her power to keep her friends safe from harm. No longer trusting herself, she surrounds herself with good people and puts her faith in them, instead. For anyone who has been made to feel like a lesser person for the abuse they&#x27;ve undergone, Illyana is a surprisingly poignant character. Her continuous struggle against her evil impulses might not always work out to everyone&#x27;s advantage, but the fact that she continues to try even when all hope seems to be lost is still inspirational.&quot; David Harth of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; stated, &quot;She looks great, with her anime-inspired costume and giant swords making her a memorable visual. The magic side of Marvel is pretty much just her, Doctor Strange, and Scarlet Witch, and she&#x27;s a more fun character than either of them. Magik has got it all: she&#x27;s powerful, entertaining, looks cool, and can handle herself in battles against supervillains, demons, and dark gods.&quot;

=== Popularity and impact ===
Kofi Outlaw of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;The character has been gaining more and more mainstream appeal in recent years – and even though the &quot;New Mutants&quot; movie adaptation became an infamous quamire, the meteoric rise of actress Anya Taylor-Joy (who played Magik in the film) has helped make the character famous on a mainstream stage.&quot; Drew Swanson of &quot;Game Rant&quot; asserted that the tragic backstory of Illyana Rasputin in &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&quot; turned her into a &quot;standout character&quot; who would become a &quot;fan-favorite addition&quot; to Insomniac Games&#x27; &quot;X-Men&quot; games. Multiple fans have cosplayed Illyana Rasputin through time. In 2022, American influencer Olivia Pierson cosplayed Illyana Rasputin alongside American media personality Kim Kardashian to celebrate Halloween.

==Literary reception==
===Volumes===
====&quot;X-Men: Return of Magik&quot; - 2008====
According to Marvel Comics, &quot;X-Men: Return of Magik&quot; #1 sold out in September 2008. According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-Men: Return of Magik&quot; #1 was the 128th best selling comic book in September 2008.

====&quot;What If? Magik&quot; - 2018====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;What If Magik&quot; #1 was the 115th best selling comic book in October 2018.

Matt Lune of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; asserted, &quot;Sometimes there are issues of &quot;What If&quot; that are so outrageous, they&#x27;d never be possible in the regular canon. Other stories, however, take already established plotlines and give them a little tweak, then show us the Butterfly Effect that this small change causes. &quot;What If Magik&quot; #1 definitely falls into the latter category, giving us a look at the life of Illyana Rasputin had she walked away from the New Mutants at a pivotal moment. [...] There&#x27;s so much to enjoy in this issue that it&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s out of continuity. Williams does an excellent job of using the somewhat reluctant pairing to enrich and deepen both central characters in a way that seems almost wasted in this one-off issue. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that this early time in Magik&#x27;s life was already fully explored by Claremont, this would make a perfect retcon flashback that could set up a future relationship between Illyana and Strange. As it stands, this is an effective examination of the two characters in a way that manages to find new things to say about both of them.&quot; Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;What If? Magik&quot; #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, saying, &quot;&quot;What If? Magik&quot; packs a novel&#x27;s worth of story into a single comic book. Leah Williams and Felipe Andrade use Magik&#x27;s history to tell a story of trauma, abusive relationships, and the road to recovery and reclamation and it is exquisitely told. Williams knows exactly when to zoom into a moment with personal dialogue and when to zoom out to let the narration carry the reader. Andrade does a great job of building his layouts around the dialogue and narration. Both Williams writing and Andrade&#x27;s artwork present strong characterizations of Magik and Doctor Strange. There are two small quibbles, however. Andrade&#x27;s expressive faces sometimes verge on the cartoonish, which is at odds with the tone of the story. The issue also begs for one last splash page to really drive home just how far Illyanna has come by the end. Regardless, this is an expertly crafted single-issue tale.&quot; Alan Kistler of &quot;Polygon&quot; included &quot;What If Magik&quot; #1 in their &quot;The greatest What If...? stories in Marvel history&quot; list.

==Other characters named Magik==
There have been other characters who have called themselves Magik:

* Margali Szardos once took up the name of Magik.
* Amanda Sefton once called herself Magik when she ended up in Limbo.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline. After Apocalypse&#x27;s attacks on Russia, her friends and family believed that Illyana had died when in fact she was taken to the slave camp known as the Core located in Seattle, which provides energy for Apocalypse&#x27;s empire. Colossus, Shadowcat and Generation NeXt rescue her, at the cost of the lives of every single member of Generation NeXt. Rasputin then helps Bishop go back in time to prevent the Age of Apocalypse from occurring in the mainstream Earth-616 timeline. In the 2000 &quot;Blink&quot; limited series, it is revealed via flashback that Sugar Man was at one point the abusive jailer in charge of cellmates Rasputin and Blink (before she was rescued as a young girl by Weapon-X and Sabretooth) in a prison facility.

===Excalibur===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in &quot;Excalibur&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Cross-Time Caper&quot; storyline. the team encounters a childlike version of Rasputin, clothed in the regalia of Doctor Strange, who runs an organized crime cartel in partnership with her friend Shadowcat. When Alistaire Stuart and a near comatose Rachel Summers are threatened by the authorities, Rasputin grants them sanctuary; however, she merely intends to use her guests in a bid for dominance over the world. When the authorities once more attempt to search Illyana&#x27;s apartment, an altercation occurs and she is shot dead but merely resurrects into her fully demonic form. That world&#x27;s Captain Britain and Psylocke arrive on the scene to help stop Rasputin. Psylocke psychically restores Phoenix, who performs an exorcism on Rasputin and restores her to her human state.

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears from Earth-4210. She is also a member of The Exiles. Rasputin replaces Blink when the Timebroker sends her home. She is led to believe that had she not become an Exile, she would murder her family. This universe&#x27;s Rasputin is much more temperamental and ruthless than the Earth-616 Magik and clashes with the team from the beginning. Shortly after the Timebroker returns Blink to the team, he decrees that half the members of the combined Exiles and Weapon X group have to die. Fearing for her life, Rasputin tries to join King Hyperion and tells him of the mission Exiles and Weapon X were given. To corroborate her claims, Hyperion snaps Rasputin&#x27;s neck to see if a replacement Exile is sent.

===House of M===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline. This is a temporary recreation of Earth-616 by the Scarlet Witch in which mutants are dominant on Earth. Rasputin is a member of a S.H.I.E.L.D. squadron of young mutants called the Hellions. Like most of the other Hellions, she eventually joins the side of the New Mutants, a team being groomed as future leaders, in fighting the establishment of the House of M in Japan. This version of Rasputin teleports to Limbo before the Scarlet Witch restores reality to its former state. This results in Belasco&#x27;s resurrection of Illyana in Earth-616. In this reality, she can speak Japanese.

===Shattershot===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in the &quot;Shattershot&quot; crossover. A reality was shown in which Rasputin was regressed in the same way as in Earth-616 but never succumbs to the Legacy Virus. She grows up to master her mutant and mystical powers, calls herself Darkchild and joins X-Force alongside Sunspot and Cannonball.

===Other===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in another reality in which she is an adult, her son is trapped in an incorporeal form. She makes a deal with Mephisto to provide him with a body, at the cost of all mutants&#x27; lives, but her son ultimately rejects the offer.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate version of Illyana Rasputin appears in the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline. Maker visited Earth-6160 and remade it into his own vision. She is seen as a member of the Rasputin family. She is among the Rasputin family members that attend Maker&#x27;s event at The City in Latveria. She was with the Rasputin family when they attended a gathering following the death of Obadiah Stane. She and the Rasputin family are among the leaders that meet outside The City after it closed up with Maker, Kang the Conqueror, and Howard Stark still inside. Rasputin is the one who states that they must make plans to divide up Howard&#x27;s territory.

During a meeting with the rest of Maker&#x27;s Council and Nick Fury, it is revealed by Magik, Colossus, and Omega Red that they have any mutants sent to the Eurasian Republic where they are using them as weapons. Magik was also revealed to have taken over Limbo on the behalf of Maker&#x27;s Council.

In a flashback, Magik and the Rasputin family are told about Logan and his regenerative abilities by Dr. Alongya Prostovich as they plan to make use of a telepath in their possession to wipe his memory and get better control over him so that he can serve as their Winter Soldier.

<text>La Roche-Guyon () is a commune in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department in Île-de-France in northern France. It is located in the , and is a member of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (The Most Beautiful Villages of France) Association.

The commune grew around the Château de La Roche-Guyon, upon which historically it depended for its existence. The commune&#x27;s population in 2019 was 479.

==Geography==
It is located approximately 58 km from Paris and 9 km from Giverny

==Château de La Roche-Guyon==
The present Château de La Roche-Guyon was built in the 12th century, controlling a river crossing of the Seine, itself one of the routes to and from Normandy; The Abbé Suger described its grim aspect: &quot;At the summit of a steep promontory, dominating the bank of the great river Seine, rises a frightful castle without title to nobility, called La Roche. Invisible on the surface, it is hollowed out of a high cliff. The able hand of the builder has established in the mountainside, digging into the rock, an ample dwelling provided with a few miserable openings&quot;. In the mid-13th century, a fortified manor house (the &quot;château-bas&quot;) was added below. Guy de La Roche fell at the Battle of Agincourt, and his widow was ousted from the Roche, after six months of siege, in 1419; she preferred to depart rather than accept Henry V of England as her overlord.

James V of Scotland and his bride Madeleine of Valois stayed for two nights in March 1537. The Château came to the Liancourt family with the marriage of Roger de Plessis-Liancourt to the heiress Marie de La Roche; he was a childhood companion of Louis XIII, first gentleman of the &quot;Chambre du Roi&quot;, and was made a duke in 1643. He and his wife made great changes to the &quot;château-bas&quot;, opening windows in its structure and laying out the terrace to the east, partly cut into the mountain&#x27;s steep slope.

The domain of La Roche-Guyon came to the La Rochefoucauld family in 1669, with the marriage of Jeanne-Charlotte de Plessis-Liancourt with François VII de La Rochefoucauld. The Château retained its medieval aspect of a fortress, with its moat and towers and cramped, dark living apartments. The Château was largely extended in the 18th century.

When Turgot, the minister of Louis XVI, failed in his schemes for fundamental reforms in 1776, he retired to the Château briefly, as the guest of Louise Elisabeth Nicole de La Rochefoucauld, Duchesse d&#x27;Enville.

La Roche Guyon was the birthplace of François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt (1747–1827).

In World War II, the château was a headquarters for German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (1891–1944). After D-Day, he defended Normandy against the Allies in World War II from a bunker located here.

In 1962, the castle was used as a setting for the medieval segment of the Belgian comic on time travel: &quot;Le Piège Diabolique&quot; (&quot;The Time Trap&quot;) of the Blake and Mortimer series by Edgar Pierre Jacobs.

After 1990, restorations and archaeological surveys undertaken by the Conservatoire régional des Monuments historiques revealed new additions to the documentary history of La Roche-Guyon, undertaken in the 19th century by Hippolyte Alexandre and Emile Rousse.

In early 1960, French technocrats had the idea for a new administrative capital, to replace Paris as capital with a French &quot;Brasília&quot; built near La Roche-Guyon and to transform the commune into a &quot;Monaco on the Seine&quot;. In early 1960, there was an architectural design competition for the Project, in which the architects Albert Laprade and Jean Brasilier participated.

The castle is opened to the public and several events take place there (Fête des Fleurs, Salon du Vin etc.)

The village is protected on its architecture (as La Roche-Guyon is locate in the Vexin Regional Park)

Several shops contribute to make the village lively with its restaurants, cafés and tea houses.

<text>Tear of Thought is the second studio album released by the Australian rock band The Screaming Jets. The album was released in October 1992 and peaked at number 3 in June 1994.

==Reviews==
Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic gave the album 3 out 5 saying; &quot;The Screaming Jets returned in 1992 with their second full-length album. &quot;Tear of Thought&quot; established them as stars rather than just another pub rock band. Musically, the disc continues in the vein of hard rock established by their debut, although this time the band experiments with some new musical direction, including the jazz-influenced &quot;Helping Hand&quot; and a faithful cover of the Boys Next Door classic, &quot;Shivers.&quot; With enough raw power to delight fans and enough experimentation to keep critics happy, &quot;Tear of Thought&quot; was an enjoyable, but ultimately disposable, example of Australian hard rock music.&quot;

<text>Kharkiv University or Karazin University (), officially V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University (), is a public university in Kharkiv, Ukraine. It was founded in 1804 through the efforts of Vasily Karazin becoming the second oldest university in modern-day Ukraine.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all buildings were partially or fully destroyed by attacks from Russian forces.

==History==
===Russian Empire===
On , the Decree on the Opening of the Imperial University in Kharkov came into force. The university became the second university in the south of the Russian Empire. It was founded on the initiative of the local community with Vasily Karazin at the fore, whose idea was supported by the nobility and the local authorities. Count Seweryn Potocki was appointed the first supervisor of the university, the first rector being the philologist and philosopher Ivan Rizhsky.

In 1811, the Philotechnical Society was founded, while the Mathematical Society of Kharkov, the Historical and Philological Society of Kharkiv, the Naturalists Society, Societies of Physics, Chemistry, Law, among others, were established in the second half of the 19th century. The first periodicals in Slobozhanshchyna appear in the university around this time, including &quot;Kharkovski Ezhenedelnik&quot; (1812), &quot;Ukrainski Vestnik&quot; (1816–1819), &quot;Ukrainski Zhurnal&quot; (1824–1825), etc.

In 1839, a veterinary school, which in 1851 became an independent institute, was established at the university. By this time, the campus included laboratories, clinics, an astronomical observatory, a botanical garden and a library.

Previously, the university was autonomous with rectors being elected. However, from 1820 to 1850, all its activity was strictly controlled. Rectors were appointed by the Minister of Education, while scientific publications, and academic processes were censored.

In 1863, under a new Statute, the university became partly autonomous.

The university has been publishing &quot;Scientific Notes&quot; since 1874.

From the 19th century up to the early 20th century, the University of Kharkiv had four schools: School of Physics and Mathematics, School of History and Philology, School of Medicine, School of Law.

The university exerted great influence on school-life in Slobozhanshchyna in the first period of its existence, largely from 1805 to 1835.

===Ukrainian SSR===
From 1917 to 1920, there was a struggle between advocates of the Ukrainian statehood and Russian course. Some of the professors who opposed new political realities left. Most of the Ukrainian professors remained in Kharkiv. They continued working in the institutions founded by the Soviet government: the Academy of Theoretical Knowledge (1920–1921), Kharkiv Institute of Public Education (KhIPE, 1921–1930), Kharkiv Institute of National Economy, Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and Institute of Law. Kharkiv State University, consisting of seven schools — School of Physics and Mathematics, School of Chemistry, School of Biology, School of Geology and Geography, School of Literature and Linguistics (with Department of Philosophy), and School of Economy (with Department of Economic Geography) — was restored on their basis in 1932–1933.

In 1921, Kharkiv Medical Institute was founded based on the School of Medicine of the University of Kharkiv.

In 1936, the university was named after the late Russian writer Maxim Gorky (though he was not related to the university during his life). During the German-Soviet war, it was evacuated to the city of Kizilord in Kazakhstan, where it merged with the Kyiv University to form the United Ukrainian State University. In 1943/44, the university returned to Kharkiv (the first academic year after the liberation of the city on 1 November 1943). In 1951, 800 university students suffered from persecution after they refused to pass exams in Russian. Court trials were held behind closed doors.

In 1977, the following schools were operating in the university: School of Mechanics and Mathematics, School of Physics, School of Geology and Geography, School of Economy, School of History, School of Philology, School of Foreign Languages, School of General Sciences, School of Correspondence Learning, and Night School.

===Independent Ukraine===

On 11 October 1999, Leonid Kuchma, the President of Ukraine issued a decree, in which he, &quot;taking into consideration considerable contribution that Kharkiv State University made to training qualified specialists and to development of science&quot; granted the status of a national university and named it after its founder, Vasyl Karazin.

In 2004, the university was given a twin building (the former Govorov Academy), opposite Svobody Square.

Russian shelling hit the building of the Faculty of Economics which was subsequently destroyed by further Russian shelling. On 5 March the university sports complex was partially destroyed. On 11 March — the building of the Faculty of Physics and Technology was partially destroyed and on 18 March — the Institute of Public Administration was partially ruined. As of 22 March 2022, according to the university&#x27;s press service, the university had no intact buildings left.

<text>The Rake&#x27;s Progress is an English-language opera from 1951 in three acts and an epilogue by Igor Stravinsky. The libretto, written by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1733–1735) of William Hogarth, which Stravinsky had seen on 2 May 1947, in a Chicago exhibition.

The story concerns the decline and fall of one Tom Rakewell, who deserts Anne Trulove for the delights of London in the company of Nick Shadow, who turns out to be the Devil. After several misadventures, all initiated by the devious Shadow, Tom ends up in Bedlam, a hospital for the insane at that time situated in the City of London. The moral of the tale is: &quot;For idle hearts and hands and minds the Devil finds work to do.&quot;

==Performance history==
It was first performed at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 11 September 1951, with Robert Rounseville as Tom Rakewell, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Anne Trulove, and Otakar Kraus as Nick Shadow. It was first given in Paris at the Opéra-Comique on 18 June 1952, under the baton of André Cluytens and produced by Louis Musy.

The American premiere was on 14 February 1953, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, conducted by Fritz Reiner and produced by George Balanchine. Although the BBC had previously produced a studio recording (broadcast on 2 January 1953), and the Glyndebourne Opera mounted a staged production at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Edinburgh in August 1953, the first staging in England was by the same company at the Glyndebourne Festival itself, opening on 15 July 1954.

In 1957, it was a part of the first season of the Santa Fe Opera under the direction of John Crosby, who persuaded the composer to attend rehearsals. Stravinsky returned to the SFO each summer through 1963. In 1961, Ingmar Bergman produced the opera at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm, where it opened on 22 April. The noteworthy 1975 Glyndebourne Festival Opera production was directed by John Cox, used sets and costumes were designed by David Hockney, and starred Leo Goeke as Tom Rakewell.

In 2010 the Berlin Staatsoper debuted Krzysztof Warlikowski&#x27;s production, which transported the action from England to America and set it in the 20th century. The production was full of references to American culture, such as Andy Warhol.

in 2015, the Utah Opera produced the opera with the costumes and set designed by David Hockney, first seen at Glyndebourne in 1975. Utah Symphony music director Thierry Fischer conducted, with stage direction by Roy Rallo, who assisted John Cox during San Francisco Opera&#x27;s 2000 revival.

Also, in 2015, Portland Opera presented the David Hockney production. Conductor was Ari Pelto and with the major roles taken by Jonathon Boyd, David Pittsinger, Maureen McKay and Angela Niederloh.

==Roles==
==Instrumentation==
Stravinsky scored the opera for a classical-sized orchestra of two flutes (one doubling piccolo), two oboes (one doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, bell, harpsichord (or piano) and strings.

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===

Tom Rakewell is courting Anne Trulove outside her father&#x27;s house in the country. Father Trulove has doubts about his daughter&#x27;s proposed marriage and tries to arrange a regular job for Tom; but Tom resists the idea and, left on his own, declares his intention to &quot;live by my wits and trust to my luck.&quot; When Tom expresses his wish for money, Nick Shadow appears and tells him that an unknown uncle has left him a substantial fortune. He then invites Tom to employ him as a servant and accompany Tom to London to sort out the inheritance.

The second scene, set in Mother Goose&#x27;s brothel, shows Shadow introducing his new master to the sleazy aspects of London life. But Tom is uneasy and laments his betrayal of love, yet accepts Mother Goose&#x27;s invitation to spend the night with her. Meanwhile, back in the country, Anne wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She knows somehow that he is in danger, and sets out for London to aid him.

===Act 2===
Tom is bored with his dissolute life. He utters his second crucial wish, for happiness, whereupon Nick makes the odd suggestion that he demonstrate his freedom by marrying Baba the Turk, the famous bearded lady. Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom&#x27;s London house, only to see him emerge from a sedan chair which also contains Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, yet genuinely regrets what has happened.

In the next scene Tom is clearly finding his eccentric marriage intolerable, as Baba is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He silences her by throwing his wig over her face, then falls asleep. Nick enters with a &quot;fantastic Baroque Machine&quot; and demonstrates how, through the use of a hidden compartment in the machine, it appears to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick hints that if such machines were mass-produced Tom could become a saviour of mankind and Tom sets out to market the machine, not knowing it is a sham.

===Act 3 and Epilogue===

The plan has failed – the act starts with the auction of the ruined Tom&#x27;s property by the maniac auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has remained immobile since being silenced by the wig. When unwrapped, she resumes her tantrum, now directed at the auction-goers for disturbing her belongings, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba advises her to find Tom and &quot;set him right&quot;, and warns her against Nick Shadow. She announces her intent to return to her life on the stage.

In a graveyard, Nick reveals his identity and demands payment from Tom, in the form of his soul; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him an escape in the form of a game of cards; this section is accompanied only by harpsichord. Tom wins, thanks to the benign influence of Anne. Defeated, Nick sinks into the ground, condemning Tom to insanity as he goes. Consigned to Bedlam, Tom believes he is Adonis. Anne (&quot;Venus&quot;) visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realises she has gone, he dies.

In an epilogue, each of the principal characters gives a moral drawn from their scenes in the opera, and then come together to ascribe a final joint moral, &quot;for idle hands, and hearts and minds, the Devil finds a work to do.&quot;

==Noted arias==
* Shadow&#x27;s Aria (&quot;Come, master, observe the host of mankind.&quot;)
* Shadow&#x27;s Departure (&quot;I burn! I freeze!&quot;)
* Anne&#x27;s Aria (&quot;No word from Tom.&quot;)
* Tom Rakewell&#x27;s Aria (&quot;Here I stand...&quot;)
* Tom Rakewell&#x27;s 2nd Aria (“Love Too Frequently Betrayed”)
* Tom Rakewell&#x27;s 3rd Aria (“Vary the Song”)
* Baba the Turk&#x27;s Aria and Monologue (&quot;As I was saying, both brothers wore moustaches...&quot;)
* Anne&#x27;s Lullaby (&quot;Gently, little boat&quot;)

==Quotes==
Shadow (goading Tom into further ridiculous behaviour):
: &quot;No eye his future can foretell&quot;
: &quot;No law his past explain&quot;
: &quot;Whom neither Passion may compel&quot;
: &quot;Nor Reason can restrain&quot;.

==Recordings==
There have been more than half a dozen recordings of the opera. The Gala recording of the 1951 live performance is available. A Sony recording, with Judith Raskin as Ann and John Reardon as Nick Shadow, is from London 1964 and is conducted by Stravinsky himself. It is currently available on the Sony/BMG 22-CD box set &quot;Works of Igor Stravinsky&quot;.

He published three collections of poems, &quot;Storm at Castelfranco&quot; (1956), &quot;Absent and Present&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Sense of Occasion&quot; (1971). He lived most of his adult life in New York, spending his summers in Italy from 1948 through 1957 and in Austria from 1958 through 1974.

In 1963 he moved his winter home from New York to Athens, Greece. He died there of a heart attack on January 18, 1975, eleven days after his 54th birthday. His funeral, in the third Jewish cemetery of Athens, was attended by some of his closest friends and colleagues, such as James Merrill, David Jackson, Tony Parigory, Nelly Liambey, Bernie Winebaum, Rachel Hadas and Alan Ansen.
Kallman had been the beneficiary of the entirety of Auden&#x27;s estate, but himself died intestate, with the result that the estate was inherited by his next-of-kin, his father, Edward Kallman (1892–1986), a New York dentist in his eighties.

==Career==

Together with his lifelong friend (and sometime lover) W. H. Auden, Kallman wrote the libretto for Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1951). They also collaborated on two librettos for Hans Werner Henze, &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Bassarids&quot; (1966), and on the libretto of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play) for Nicolas Nabokov (1973). Additionally, they wrote the libretto &quot;Delia, or, A Masque of Night&quot; (1953), intended for Stravinsky but never set to music. They were commissioned to write the lyrics for &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, but Kallman did not work on the project, and the producers decided against using Auden&#x27;s contributions.

Kallman was the sole author of the libretto of &quot;The Tuscan Players&quot; for Carlos Chávez (1953, first performed in 1957 as &quot;Panfilo and Lauretta&quot;).

He and Auden collaborated on a number of libretto translations, notably &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1956) and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1961). Kallman also translated Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; (1954), Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;The Coronation of Poppea&quot; (1954) and many other operas.

<doc id="719984" wikidata="Q422141" url="?curid=719984" title="Yellowcake">
<text>Yellowcake (also called urania) is a type of powdered uranium concentrate obtained from leach solutions, in an intermediate step in the processing of uranium ores. It is a step in the processing of uranium after it has been mined but before fuel fabrication or uranium enrichment. Yellowcake concentrates are prepared by various extraction and refining methods, depending on the types of ores. Typically, yellowcakes are obtained through the milling and chemical processing of uranium ore, forming a coarse powder that has a pungent odor, is insoluble in water, and contains about 80% uranium oxide, which melts at approximately 2880 °C.

==Overview==
Originally, raw uranium ore was extracted by traditional mining, and this is still the case in many mines. It is first crushed to a fine powder by passing it through crushers and grinders to produce &quot;pulped&quot; ore. This is further processed with concentrated acid, alkaline, or peroxide solutions to leach out the uranium. However, nearly half of yellowcake production is now produced by in situ leaching in which the solution is pumped through the uranium deposit without disturbing the ground. Yellowcake is what remains after drying and filtering. The yellowcake produced by most modern mills is actually brown or black, not yellow; the name comes from the color and texture of the concentrates produced by early mining operations.
Initially, the compounds formed in yellowcakes were not identified; in 1970, the U.S. Bureau of Mines still referred to yellowcakes as the final precipitate formed in the milling process and considered it to be ammonium diuranate or sodium diuranate. The compositions were variable and depended upon the leachant and subsequent precipitating conditions. The compounds identified in yellowcakes include uranyl hydroxide, uranyl sulfate, sodium para-uranate, and uranyl peroxide, along with various uranium oxides. Modern yellowcake typically contains 70% to 90% triuranium octoxide (U3O8) by weight. Other oxides such as uranium dioxide (UO2) and uranium trioxide (UO3) exist.

Yellowcake is produced by all countries in which uranium ore is mined.

=== Further processing ===
Yellowcake is used in the preparation of uranium fuel for nuclear reactors, for which it is smelted into purified UO2 for use in fuel rods for pressurized heavy-water reactors and other systems that use natural unenriched uranium.

Purified uranium can also be enriched into the isotope U-235. In this process, the uranium oxides are combined with fluorine to form uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). Next, the gas undergoes isotope separation through the process of gaseous diffusion, or in a gas centrifuge. This can produce low-enriched uranium containing up to 20% U-235 that is suitable for use in most large civilian electric-power reactors. With further processing, one obtains highly enriched uranium, containing 20% or more U-235, that is suitable for use in compact nuclear reactors—usually used to power naval warships and submarines. Further processing can yield weapons-grade uranium with U-235 levels usually above 90%, suitable for nuclear weapons.

== Radioactivity and safety ==

The uranium in yellowcake is almost exclusively (&gt;99%) U-238, with very low radioactivity. U-238 has a half-life of 4.468 billion years and emits radiation at a slow rate. This stage of processing is before the more radioactive U-235 is concentrated, so by definition, this stage of uranium has the same radioactivity as it did in nature when it was underground, as the proportions of isotopes are at their native relative concentration. Yellowcake is hazardous when inhaled.

On television, she guest-starred on &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; and &quot;Ironside&quot;. She had supporting roles in the psychological thriller film &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (1971), and the Western films &quot;Posse&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976) in which she becomes the last actress to exchange lines with John Wayne. In the late 1970s, Scott made number-of guest appearances on nighttime series such as, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and a recurring role on &quot;The Waltons&quot;. She co-starred in the 1977 supernatural horror film &quot;The Car&quot; and the following year appeared in the horror films &quot;The Fury&quot; and &quot;Piranha&quot;.

In 1979, at the age of 23, Scott took over the role of Nikki Reed, a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks, on the daytime serial &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, choosing the part over a sitcom pilot that in the end was not picked up. She was a replacement for the previous Nikki, who had lasted six months. Over time, her character reformed and became an important part of Genoa City society, as she married Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Scott has said, &quot;It&#x27;s a miracle for an actor to have a job last 35 years. I am so blessed.&quot; In 1999, she received Daytime Emmy Awards nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

Scott made guest-starring appearances in a number of prime time series, such as &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot;. She was a celebrity guest on &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; for a week in June 1985.

On February 19, 2019 &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; featured a stand-alone episode to honor Scott&#x27;s 40-year history with the serial. In 2024, Scott received Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Personal life==
On the set of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, she met her third husband, the show&#x27;s executive producer Edward J. Scott. They married in 1985 and have three daughters, Jennifer (his daughter from a previous marriage), Alexandra Danielle Yeaggy (father is the late Carlos Yeaggy, a makeup artist Melody met on the set of &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;.) and Elizabeth. The family resides in Beverly Hills, California. Jennifer gave birth to twins on May 25, 2011, a boy named James and a girl named Charlotte. James and Charlotte are Melody and Edward&#x27;s first and second grandchild, respectively.

<doc id="720034" wikidata="Q175658" url="?curid=720034" title="Friends (The Beach Boys album)">
<text>Friends is the fourteenth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on June 24, 1968, through Capitol Records. The album is characterized by its calm and peaceful atmosphere, which contrasted the prevailing music trends of the time, and by its brevity, with five of its 12 tracks running less than two minutes long. It initially sold poorly, peaking at number 126 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the group&#x27;s lowest U.S. chart performance to date, although it reached number 13 in the UK. Since its release, fans have generally come to regard the album as one of the band&#x27;s finest, with many considering it among the greatest albums of all time.

As with their two previous albums, &quot;Friends&quot; was recorded primarily at Brian Wilson&#x27;s home with a lo-fi production style. The album&#x27;s sessions lasted from February to April 1968 at a time when the band&#x27;s finances were rapidly diminishing. Despite crediting production to &quot;the Beach Boys&quot;, Wilson actively led the entire project, later referring to it as his second unofficial solo album (the first being 1966&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;). Some of the songs were inspired by the group&#x27;s recent involvement with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his Transcendental Meditation practice. It was the first album to feature songs from Dennis Wilson.

One single was issued from the album: &quot;Friends&quot;, a waltz that reached number 47 in the U.S. and number 25 in the UK. Its B-side was the Dennis co-write &quot;Little Bird&quot;. In May, the group scheduled a national tour with the Maharishi, but it was canceled after five shows due to low ticket sales and the Maharishi&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal. A standalone single, &quot;Do It Again&quot;, was released in July. It reached the U.S. top twenty, became their second number one hit in the UK, and was included in foreign pressings of &quot;Friends&quot;.

&quot;Friends&quot; received favorable reviews in the music press, but like their records since &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (1967), the album&#x27;s simplicity divided critics and fans. Despite the failure of a collaborative tour with the Maharishi, the group remained supporters of him and his teachings. Dennis contributed more songs on later Beach Boys albums, eventually culminating in a solo record, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;. In 2018, session highlights, outtakes, and alternate takes were released for the compilation &quot;Wake the World: The Friends Sessions&quot;.

==Background==
In September and December 1967, the Beach Boys released &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, respectively. Music fans were generally disappointed that the band twice failed to deliver on the hype surrounding their unreleased album &quot;Smile&quot;, which was advertised as the follow-up to the sophistication of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (both 1966). Instead, the group were making a deliberate choice to produce music that was simpler and less refined. Commenting on &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, Mike Love said the band made a conscious decision to be &quot;completely out of the mainstream for what was going on at that time, which was all hard rock/psychedelic music. [The album] just didn’t have anything to do with what was going on.&quot;

Although &quot;Wild Honey&quot; charted higher than &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; in the US, it was ultimately the group&#x27;s lowest-selling album to that point. Apart from a two-week U.S. tour in November 1967, the band was not performing live during this period, and their finances were rapidly diminishing. That same month, the group stopped wearing their longtime striped-shirt stage uniforms in favor of matching white, polyester suits that were similar to a Las Vegas show band.

Dennis Wilson, Al Jardine, and Mike Love were among the many rock musicians who discovered the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi following the Beatles&#x27; public endorsement of his Transcendental Meditation technique in August 1967. In December, the touring group attended a lecture by the Maharishi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris and were moved by the simplicity and effectiveness of his meditation process as a means to obtaining inner peace. They were invited to meet the Maharishi in his hotel room the same day, and according to Brian, &quot;they came back and Carl was] just floating. ... it got to me through him.&quot; He recalled that he had &quot;already been initiated&quot; beforehand, but &quot;for some ridiculous reason I hadn&#x27;t followed through with it, and when you don&#x27;t follow through with something you can get all clogged up. ... we&#x27;re all meditating together now.&quot;

In a January 1968 interview, Brian stated that the group was unsure what their next production would be, but that &quot;it won&#x27;t be very long now until I come up with a song about meditation. It shouldn&#x27;t be more than a month.&quot; He also expressed an interest in &quot;pull[ing] out of conventional sound making and get[ting] into sounds that have never been made before ever.&quot; In early February, the group performed scattered gigs in the U.S. with Buffalo Springfield. The Beach Boys attended the Maharishi&#x27;s public appearances in New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts, after which he invited Love to join the Beatles at his training seminar in Rishikesh in northern India. Love stayed there from February 28 to March 15. In his absence, the rest of the group began recording the album that would become &quot;Friends&quot;.

==Recording history==
&quot;Friends&quot; was recorded primarily at the Beach Boys&#x27; private studio, located within Brian&#x27;s Bel Air home, from late February to early April 1968. It was written, performed, or produced mainly by the Wilson brothers with what Stebbins terms &quot;a strong assist&quot; from Al Jardine. Jardine remembered how he still &quot;felt that [Brian] had a lot to offer. ... We wrote [most of the &quot;Friends&quot; music] at his house right under that beautiful stained glass &quot;Wild Honey&quot; cover window.&quot; He added: &quot;We&#x27;d get together in the morning. A lot of activity took place in the kitchen. ... We were in there as much as in the studio. God, we ate well.&quot;

It was the first Beach Boys album not to have Brian consistently as primary composer, and the first to feature significant songwriting contributions from other group members. Asked as to the level of Wilson&#x27;s input, band archivists Mark Linett and Alan Boyd said that Wilson led the entire project, even on the songs that he did not compose. In a 1976 interview, Wilson referred to &quot;Friends&quot; as his second &quot;solo album&quot;, the first being &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Stephen Desper was recruited as the band&#x27;s recording engineer, a role he would keep until 1972. He had been recently contacted to convert Brian&#x27;s semi-portable home recording set-up to a more permanent &quot;full-fledged recording studio with the capacity of any other&quot;. Session musicians were used more than on &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, but in smaller configurations than on the Beach Boys&#x27; records from 1962 through 1966.

From February 20 or 27 to March 15, the band tracked &quot;Little Bird&quot;, &quot;Be Here in the Mornin″&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot;. After Love returned from his retreat, they began recording &quot;When a Man Needs a Woman&quot;, &quot;Passing By&quot;, &quot;Busy Doin&#x27; Nothin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Wake the World&quot;, &quot;Meant for You&quot;, &quot;Anna Lee, the Healer&quot;, and &quot;Be Still&quot;. By the spring of 1968, the Beach Boys were overdue to submit an album to Capitol, and so Brian rushed to finish the &quot;Friends&quot; album while his bandmates were on tour. Sessions concluded with &quot;Diamond Head&quot; on April 12. Desper mixed the album for stereo. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be mixed and released exclusively in true stereo, as the band&#x27;s releases since &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; (1965) had only been available in mono or Duophonic.

==Music and lyrics==
The LP has a relatively short length; only two of its 12 tracks last longer than three minutes, and five run short of two minutes. In author Jon Stebbins&#x27; description, the album &quot;reflects the peaceful and quietly centered aura&quot; that the band had gained from their introduction to Transcendental Meditation. Bruce Johnston described the album as a conscious attempt to make something &quot;really subtle ... that wasn&#x27;t concerned with radio&quot;. Retrospectively, the album may be viewed as the final installment in a consecutive three-part series of lo-fi Beach Boys albums. Columnist Joel Goldenburg believes that the lightly produced album was the closest the group ever came to sunshine pop, a genre they had influenced but never fully embraced.

For the album&#x27;s 1990 CD liner notes, Brian recalled that he &quot;had a good thing rollin&#x27; in my head. The bad things that had happened to me had taken their toll and I was free to find out just how much I had grown through the emotional pain that had come my way. ... I think that the Beach Boys’ sound was evolving right along.&quot; The few tracks where he served as primary author contained his usual composing trademarks, such as unexpected harmonic changes, descending stepwise progressions, and unusually structured musical phrases. As on much of his compositions of the period, there was a heavy influence drawn from Burt Bacharach.

Subject matter ranges from Transcendental Meditation to bearing children and &quot;doin&#x27; nothin&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jim Miller characterized &quot;Friends&quot; as a &quot;return to &quot;Smiley&quot;″s dryness, minus the weirdness&quot;. Musicologist Daniel Harrison said Miller&#x27;s observation was only true of &quot;Meant for You&quot;, and that the remaining songs &quot;have few of the formal or harmonic quirks of the earlier album, though there is no lack of clever and interesting effects, such as the bass harmonica line in &#x27;Passing By&#x27; or the repetitive monophonic organ line in the break of &#x27;Be Here in the Morning.&#x27;&quot; The group&#x27;s influences, according to rock critic Gene Sculatti, seemed to derive &quot;primarily from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, and little else. The characteristic innocence and somewhat childlike visions imparted to their music are applied directly to the theme of the album: friendships. As usual, the lyrics tend to be basic, yet as expressive as they need to be; words, like individual voices or instruments, are all part of the larger whole of music&quot;.

Johnston was unhappy with the group&#x27;s &quot;wimpy&quot; songs and opined that the new material—with the sole exception of the title track—did not represent Brian &quot;at full strength&quot;. When asked why the band did not pursue harder rock styles, Jardine responded that &quot;for Carl and me, we were painting a canvas. Jimi [Hendrix] was one of the best in the world, but they were more of a performance phenomenon, representing an era. ... We didn&#x27;t have that need, because I think it’s a need.&quot; Brian similarly felt no pressure to make &quot;heavy&quot; music: &quot;We never needed to. It&#x27;s already been done.&quot;

==Content==
===Side one===

&quot;Meant for You&quot; is a 38-second introduction to the album and the shortest song in the group&#x27;s catalog. It was originally conceived as &quot;You&#x27;ll Find it Too&quot;, with a longer runtime of about two minutes, and featured additional lyrics about a pony and a puppy.

&quot;Friends&quot; is a waltz that was originally composed in 4/4 time. The song was arranged and co-written by Brian, who described it as his favorite on the album. &quot;Wake the World&quot; was the first original songwriting collaboration between Brian and Jardine. It was another song that Brian said was &quot;my favorite cut [on the album]. It was so descriptive to how I felt about the dramatic change over from day to night.&quot; The song is the first on the album that demonstrates his then-recent &quot;a-day-in-a-life-of&quot; songwriting habit.

&quot;Be Here in the Mornin&#x27;″&quot; and &quot;When a Man Needs a Woman&quot; were written about some particular comforts of Brian&#x27;s daily life. The former is another waltz and features the Wilsons&#x27; father Murry contributing a bass vocal. The song makes a passing lyrical reference to the Wilsons&#x27; cousin Steve Korthof, road manager Jon Parks, and Beach Boys manager Nick Grillo. Parks and Korthof themselves shared a writing credit on &quot;When a Man Needs a Woman&quot;. The song was inspired by Marilyn Wilson&#x27;s pregnancy with her and Brian&#x27;s first child Carnie, although the lyric suggests that Brian thought it would be a boy.

&quot;Passing By&quot; is wordless, with the melody hummed by Brian. The piece had discarded lyrics written for it: &quot;While walking down the avenue / I stopped to have a look at you / And then I saw / You were just passing by&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Anna Lee, the Healer&quot; is about a masseuse Mike Love encountered in Rishikesh. The arrangement consists only of vocals, piano, bass, and hand drumming.

&quot;Little Bird&quot; was composed by Dennis Wilson with poet Stephen Kalinich, which Brian said &quot;blew my mind because it was so full of spiritualness. He was a late bloomer as a music maker. He lived hard and rough but his music was as sensitive as anyone&#x27;s.&quot; The bridge section incorporates elements of &quot;Child Is Father of the Man&quot;, a then-unreleased song from &quot;Smile&quot;. According to Kalinich, Brian composed virtually the entirety of &quot;Little Bird&quot;, but chose not to receive an official writing credit.

&quot;Be Still&quot;, another Dennis/Kalinich song, only features Dennis&#x27; singing and Brian playing organ. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin compared the song to a &quot;Unitarian hymn&quot; and interpreted the lyrics to be a description of &quot;the sacred essence of life and the human potential to interact with God.&quot;

The final three tracks are genre experiments that break stylistically from the rest of the album. &quot;Busy Doin&#x27; Nothin&#x27;&quot; is a flirtation with bossa nova, one of several autobiographic slice-of-life songs written by Brian during this era, and one of the only tracks on the album where he exclusively used session musicians. The lyrics contain step-by-step instructions on how to find his house, albeit without mentioning where to start: &quot;Drive for a couple miles / You&#x27;ll see a sign and turn left / For a couple blocks ... &quot;

&quot;Diamond Head&quot; is an instrumental exotica lounge jam that echoed the use of extended forms from &quot;Smile&quot;, and is the album&#x27;s longest piece at 3 minutes and 39 seconds. Biographer Mark Dillon surmised that it was likely inspired by the group&#x27;s visit to Hawaii during the previous year.

&quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot; contrasts all that comes before it with its raucous tone. Asked about the song, Dennis explained that the group &quot;wanted to get away from anything that sounded too pompous, too religious. It would have been easy to do something peaceful, very Eastern, but we were trying to reach listeners on all levels.&quot; Jardine viewed it as a weak effort.

===Leftover===

Leftover tracks from the sessions include &quot;Untitled #1&quot;, &quot;Away&quot;, &quot;Our New Home&quot; (or &quot;Our Happy Home&quot;), &quot;New Song&quot; (unofficially known as &quot;Spanish Guitar&quot;), &quot;You&#x27;re As Cool As Can Be&quot;, covers of Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;My Little Red Book&quot; and Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot;, a demo for &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot;, and an early version of &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. &quot;Our Happy Home&quot; was described by music journalist Brian Chidester as &quot;a short, bouncy riff that maintains the gentle air of the &quot;Friends&quot; sessions&quot;. It was later reworked as &quot;Our Sweet Love&quot; for their 1970 album &quot;Sunflower&quot;, along with &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. &quot;New Song&quot; contains a melody that was recycled for &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re As Cool As Can Be&quot; is an instrumental of unknown authorship that features an upbeat piano melody played by Brian. &quot;Away&quot; was a song Dennis wrote with touring musician Billy Hinsche in December 1967.

==Maharishi tour==


On April 5, 1968, the band began &quot;the Million Dollar Tour&quot;, a series of self-financed concerts across the American south. Featuring Buffalo Springfield and Strawberry Alarm Clock as supporting acts, these shows were poorly attended due in part to the political mood following the assassination of Martin Luther King that April. Six of the 35 dates were canceled, while two were rescheduled. They lost $350,000 in expected revenue (equivalent to $ in ). Mike Love arranged that the group tour the U.S. with the Maharishi in May. According to Nick Grillo, the band hoped that touring with the Maharishi would recuperate some of their financial losses. The Beatles also became disenchanted with the Maharishi and the Spiritual Regeneration Movement and publicly expressed their concerns around this time, which had a detrimental effect on the guru&#x27;s standing among music fans. In Stebbins&#x27; description, the Maharishi became a pariah.

The shows with the Maharishi were advertised as &quot;The Most Exciting Event of the Decade!&quot; and comprised a set of songs by the Beach Boys followed by the Maharishi&#x27;s lecture on the benefits of meditation. The tour started on May 3 and ended abruptly after five shows. A performance at the Singer Bowl in Queens, New York was canceled twenty minutes before the group were scheduled to perform when only 800 people showed up to the 16,000-capacity venue. Writing in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Loraine Alterman reported on the hostile audience reaction to the Maharishi but said that the songs the band included from &quot;Friends&quot; worked well beside the group&#x27;s previous hits &quot;because they were happy and full of love&quot;. She added that, unlike the Maharishi&#x27;s lecture, the song &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot; &quot;did not tax anyone&#x27;s brain. It just repeated how transcendental meditation &#x27;makes you feel grand&#x27; against a moving beat.&quot;

Because of the disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal to fulfill film contracts, the remaining 24 tour dates were canceled at a cost estimated at $250,000 for the band (equivalent to $ in ). Afterward, Love and Carl told journalists that the racial violence following King&#x27;s assassination was to blame for the tour&#x27;s demise. Carl said: &quot;A lot of people just would not let their children out. Nobody wants to get hurt.&quot; He added that the group&#x27;s goal was to appeal mainly to young people, &quot;but not the teeny-boppers&quot;, while Love commented that the shows were &quot;not put together for commercial purposes&quot;. In his 2016 autobiography, Love wrote: &quot;I take responsibility for an idea that didn&#x27;t work. But I don&#x27;t regret it. I thought I could do some good for people who were lost, confused, or troubled, particularly those who were young and idealistic but also vulnerable, and I thought that was true for a whole bunch of us.&quot;

==Sleeve design==
&quot;Friends&quot; was packaged with a cover artwork, designed by David McMacken, that depicted the band members in a psychedelic visual style. Love remembered that the group lacked &quot;savvy marketing and design&quot;, and that while in Rishikesh, Paul McCartney had urged him &quot;to take more care of what you put on your album covers&quot;. Johnston opined that the &quot;Friends&quot; cover ultimately ranked second to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; for being the worst &quot;in the history of the music business&quot;. Matijas-Mecca said the artwork &quot;did nothing to convince anyone that the Beach Boys were in touch with anything in particular&quot;.

==Release==
Lead single &quot;Friends&quot; was issued on April 8 and reached number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it their lowest-charting single in six years. On June 4, the Beach Boys appeared on &quot;The Les Crane Show&quot; and discussed their support of the Maharishi. The &quot;Friends&quot; album followed on June 24.

On July 2, the group embarked on a three-week U.S. tour with further dates continuing throughout August, including some stops in Canada. Their setlists included &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Little Bird&quot;, and &quot;Wake the World&quot;. Several supporting musicians accompanied the group (keyboardist Daryl Dragon, bassist Ed Carter, percussionist Mike Kowalski, and a brass section). Johnston remembered that performing the &quot;Friends&quot; songs caused him to &quot;wince&quot;, and that it was difficult to maintain the &quot;subtle&quot; nature of the songs in a live setting.

On July 6, &quot;Friends&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart at number 179 and subsequently peaked at number 126 while artists such as the Doors and Cream occupied the top positions. On July 8, the band released &quot;Do It Again&quot; as a standalone single backed with &quot;Wake the World&quot;. &quot;Do It Again&quot; was recorded within the prior two months as a self-conscious throwback to the group&#x27;s early surf songs, and the first time they had embraced the subject matter since 1964. It reached the top twenty in the U.S. and was a number one hit in the UK. When &quot;Friends&quot; was issued in Japan, the song was included in the album&#x27;s track list.

Love recalled that the album&#x27;s commercial failure caused Capitol to &quot;panic&quot;. On August 5, the label issued the greatest hits album &quot;Best of the Beach Boys Vol. 3&quot; to recuperate from the LP&#x27;s poor sales. Matijas-Mecca wrote that this was a sign that the label had &quot;given up&quot; on the group, repeating a tactic they used after the release of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and again with &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. While the first two volumes were quickly certified as gold records, biographer David Leaf said that the label was &quot;more than a little horrified to watch [the third volume] sink like a stone, unable to even outperform &quot;Friends&quot;.&quot; A collection of Beach Boys backing tracks, &quot;Stack-o-Tracks&quot;, was issued by Capitol on August 19. The album became the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the U.S. and UK. &quot;Friends&quot; ended its 10-week stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on September 7. Ultimately, the album&#x27;s record sales in the U.S. (estimated at 18,000 units) were the group&#x27;s worst to date. In the UK, the album fared better, reaching number 13 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===

&quot;Friends&quot; received a number of positive reviews, but according to historian Keith Badman, most were published &quot;too late to influence sales&quot;. According to a &quot;Mojo&quot; retrospective, the band&#x27;s remaining fanbase reacted to the album with the abandonment of &quot;any hope that Brian Wilson would deliver a true successor to his 1966 masterwork&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Stebbins noted that its &quot;quirky gentleness in the context of political protests, race riots, and the war-torn social landscape of 1968 [made] it about as square a peg as one can imagine&quot;. Music critic Richie Unterberger said that the group lost most of their audience by being &quot;less experimental&quot; with their music.

Upon release, a &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer predicted that &quot;the group should score high on the charts&quot; with the album and highlighted &quot;Anna Lee, the Healer&quot; and &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot; as &quot;catchy numbers&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Arthur Schmidt wrote in his review of the album: &quot;Everything on the first side is great. ... Listen once and you might think this album is nowhere. But it&#x27;s really just at a very special place, and after a half-dozen listenings, you can be there.&quot; &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;″s Gene Sculatti reported that there were detractors of the Beach Boys who most frequently took issue with the band&#x27;s &quot;apparently excessive immersion in and identification with mass culture and &#x27;commercialism&#x27;&quot;. In spite of such criticisms, he deemed &quot;Friends&quot; &quot;[perhaps] their best&quot; work yet, calling it &quot;the culmination of the efforts and the results of their last three LPs. ... It is another showcase for what is the most original and perhaps the most consistently satisfying rock music being created today.&quot;

In his review for &quot;NME&quot;, Allen Evans commented on the brevity of several of the tracks and described &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot; as &quot;a weirdo piece&quot; and &quot;Passing By&quot; as &quot;quite delightful&quot; in its use of &quot;voices … as instruments&quot;. He concluded: &quot;Varied and interesting, though maybe not their best LP.&quot; Writing in the same publication&#x27;s annual for 1968, Keith Altham reported that &quot;Do It Again&quot; &quot;seemed like two steps backwards&quot; but had nevertheless re-established the Beach Boys as hit-makers, while &quot;Friends&quot; received &quot;considerable criticism from critics who complained that one entire side of the album lasted just a few minutes longer than the hit single &#x27;MacArthur Park&#x27;&quot;. In &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot;, Penny Valentine wrote of the &quot;Friends&quot; single, &quot;Whither the progressive Beach Boys? ... If The Beach Boys are as bored as they sound, they should stop bothering ... They are no longer the brilliant Beach Boys. They are grey and they are making sad little grey records.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s David Griffiths referred to &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot; as &quot;the most disappointing Beach Boys track of the year&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In its 1990 liner notes, David Leaf wrote that &quot;Friends&quot; was since reevaluated as &quot;one of the Beach Boys&#x27; finest artistic efforts,&quot; whereas critic Will Hermes wrote in 2019: &quot;The music from this period has generally been considered subpar by the impossible-to-match standards set by &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Donald A. Guarisco described the album as a &quot;cult favorite&quot; among hardcore fans and highlighted the title track as &quot;mellow&quot;, &quot;lovely&quot;, and &quot;a good example of the Beach Boys&#x27; late-&#x27;60s output: it is far less musically complex than &#x27;California Girls&#x27; or &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&#x27; but possesses a homespun charm all its own.&quot;

An uncredited writer for &quot;Mojo&quot; opined that &quot;Given distance and hindsight ... &quot;Friends&quot; is a uniquely rewarding Beach Boys album that, excepting &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, is the group&#x27;s most sonically and thematically unified.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; contributor Noel Murray said the album was &quot;lovely&quot; and one of the group&#x27;s &quot;warmest and most spiritual records&quot;. &quot;Brooklyn Vegan&quot;″s Andrew Sacher characterized it as &quot;the most underrated Beach Boys album&quot;, &quot;prettier and less quirky&quot; than &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, and lamented that it is not as widely praised as the Byrds&#x27; contemporary effort &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;.

Jason Fine wrote in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;: &quot;If you can get past sappy wannabe-hippie tracks such as &#x27;Wake the World&#x27; and &#x27;Transcendental Meditation&#x27;, the album is gorgeous, with standout moments including &#x27;Meant for You&#x27;, one of Mike Love’s finest vocals, and Brian’s &#x27;Busy Doin&#x27; Nothin″&#x27;&quot;. In his review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger said that, relative to its unveiling in 1968, &quot;Today [the album] sounds better, but it&#x27;s certainly one of the group&#x27;s more minor efforts&quot;, adding that the production and harmonies &quot;remained pleasantly idiosyncratic, but there was little substance at the heart of most of the songs.&quot; In 1971, Robert Christgau dismissed &quot;Friends&quot; as the band&#x27;s &quot;worstever&quot; work. Biographer Steven Gaines described the LP as &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;emotionless&quot;.

Among other musicians, journalist and Saint Etienne co-founder Bob Stanley called the album a &quot;lost gem&quot; with a &quot;timeless quality in its simplicity, underlined by the basic instrumentation&quot;. Paul Weller named it as one of his favorite albums of all time. It was voted number 662 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

== Legacy ==
In his book &quot;Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius&quot;, Gary Lachman describes &quot;Friends&quot; as &quot;the Beach Boys TM album&quot; and considers their public association with the Maharishi to have been a &quot;disastrous flirtation&quot; that, for Dennis Wilson, was soon superseded by a more damaging personal association with the Manson Family cult. Despite the ignominy of the tour, the Beach Boys remained ardent supporters of the Maharishi and Transcendental Meditation. They continued to record songs inspired by the Maharishi or his teachings, including both &quot;He Come Down&quot; and &quot;All This Is That&quot; on 1972&#x27;s &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;, and both &quot;Everyone&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; and &quot;T M Song&quot; on 1976&#x27;s &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;. Subsequent albums would also see Dennis contribute more songs, eventually culminating in a solo record, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;.

Stebbins recognizes &quot;Friends&quot; as marking &quot;the true beginning of the Beach Boys as a group of six relatively equal creative partners&quot;. It was the last Beach Boys album where Brian held most of the writing or co-writing credits until 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;. The band&#x27;s following album &quot;20/20&quot; was released in February 1969, with a substantial portion of the LP consisting of leftover singles recorded in 1968 and outtakes from earlier albums. Brian produced virtually none of the post-Friends recordings.

In the summer of 1969, Brian worked with Stephen Kalinich to produce a spoken-word LP, &quot;A World of Peace Must Come&quot;, which included an extended run-through of &quot;Be Still&quot;. The album was not released until 2008. Shortly after the sale of Sea of Tunes, friend Stanley Shapiro persuaded Brian to rewrite and rerecord a number of Beach Boys songs to restore his public and industry reputation. After contacting fellow songwriter Tandyn Almer for support, the trio spent a month reworking cuts from &quot;Friends&quot;, including &quot;Passing By&quot;, &quot;Wake the World&quot;, &quot;Be Still&quot;, and the album&#x27;s title track. As Shapiro handed demo tapes to A&amp;M Records executives, they found the product favorable before they learned of Wilson and Almer&#x27;s involvement, and refused to support the project. Most of these recordings remain unreleased.

In November 1974, a double album reissue that paired &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; hit number 125 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Brian cited &quot;Friends&quot; as his favorite Beach Boys album, and said that while &quot;Smile&quot; &quot;had potential ... &quot;Friends&quot; has been good listening no matter what mood I&#x27;m in.&quot; He rerecorded &quot;Meant for You&quot; for his 1995 solo album &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot; and performed songs from the &quot;Friends&quot; album live with Jardine in 2019. Among cover versions of the &quot;Friends&quot; tracks: Pizzicato Five recorded &quot;Passing By&quot; for their album &quot;Sister Freedom Tapes&quot; (1996), and the High Llamas contributed a version of &quot;Anna Lee, the Healer&quot; to the tribute album &quot;Caroline Now!: The Songs of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys&quot; (2000). Noel Murray remarked that without &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;the High Llamas probably wouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot; Lo-fi musician R. Stevie Moore based his 1975 song &quot;Wayne Wayne (Go Away)&quot; on &quot;Friends&quot;.

===&quot;Friends / 20/20&quot; 1990/2001 CD reissue bonus tracks===
===&quot;Wake the World&quot;===


On December 7, 2018, Capitol released &quot;Wake the World: The Friends Sessions&quot;, a digital-only compilation. Included are session highlights, outtakes, and alternate versions of &quot;Friends&quot; tracks, as well as some unreleased material by Dennis and Brian Wilson. It is the successor to &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot; from the previous year. Along with &quot;I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions&quot;, &quot;Wake the World&quot; was not issued on physical media due to the record company&#x27;s wish not to interfere with the release of &quot;The Beach Boys with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;.

<text>Hotan (also known by other names) is a major oasis town in southwestern Xinjiang, an autonomous region in Northwestern China. The city proper of Hotan broke off from the larger Hotan County to become an administrative area in its own right in August 1984. It is the seat of Hotan Prefecture.

With a population of 408,900 (2018 census), Hotan is situated in the Tarim Basin some southwest of the regional capital, Ürümqi. It lies just north of the Kunlun Mountains, which are crossed by the Sanju, Hindutash and Ilchi passes. The town, located southeast of Yarkant County and populated almost exclusively by Uyghurs, is a minor agricultural center. An important station on the southern branch of the historic Silk Road, Hotan has always depended on two strong rivers, the Karakash River and the White Jade River, to provide the water needed to survive on the southwestern edge of the vast Taklamakan Desert. The White Jade River still provides water and irrigation for the town and oasis.

==Etymology==
Hotan and its surrounding area were originally known as &quot;Godana&quot; in ancient Sanskrit cosmological texts. The Chinese transcribed the name as , pronounced &quot;Gudana&quot; in Middle Chinese (&quot;Yutian&quot; in modern Standard Chinese); the pronunciation eventually morphed into Khotan. In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar Xuanzang attempted to remedy this lexical change. Xuanzang, who was well-versed in Sanskrit, proposed that the traditional name was in fact &quot;Kustana&quot; () and asserted it meant &quot;breast of the earth&quot;. However, this was likely borrowed from the Tibetan name for the region, Gosthana, which means &quot;land of cows&quot;. It is therefore most likely that the original name of Hotan was Sanskritic in origin, a consequence of ancient Indian settlement in the region.

An alternative etymology is proposed by Harold Walter Bailey, an expert in the Khotanese language. He believes the oldest indigenous name to be &quot;Hvatana&quot;.

Hotan was known to 19th-century European explorers as &quot;Ilchi&quot;.

The official Uyghur-to-Latin transliteration, and therefore English spelling, of the modern city&#x27;s name is &quot;Hotan&quot; according to the &quot;Register of Chinese Geographic Places&quot;. The Hanyu pinyin romanization Hetian has been used on some maps and by some airports. The city&#x27;s former Chinese name was written with a different character for &quot;tian&quot; ().

==History==


The oasis of Hotan is strategically located at the junction of the southern (and most ancient) branch of the Silk Road joining China and the West with one of the main routes from ancient India and Tibet to Central Asia and distant China. It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another.

Tocharians lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the Tarim mummies were found in the region. At Sampul, east of the city of Hotan, there is an extensive series of cemeteries scattered over an area about wide and long. The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE. The excavated graves have produced a number of fabrics of felt, wool, silk and cotton and even a fine bit of tapestry, the Sampul tapestry, showing the face of a Caucasoid man which was made of threads of 24 shades of color. The tapestry had been cut up and fashioned into trousers worn by one of the deceased. An Anthropological study of 56 individuals showed a primarily Caucasoid population. A study in 2010 showed that an Eastern Eurasian lineage common in Siberia dominates the mitochondrial DNA of the mummies from the Xiaohe Cemetery. Their Y chromosome is distributed throughout Eastern Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, and Siberia.

There is a relative abundance of information on Hotan readily available for study. The main historical sources are to be found in the Chinese histories (particularly detailed during the Han and early Tang dynasties) when China was interested in control of the Western Regions, the accounts of several Chinese pilgrim monks, a few Buddhist histories of Hotan that have survived in Classical Tibetan and a large number of documents in the Iranian Saka language and other languages discovered, for the most part, early this century at various sites in the Tarim Basin and from the hidden library at the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang.

=== Indo-Greek Khotan ===
In the Hellenistic period, there was an Indo-Greek colony in Khotan.

===Buddhist Khotan===
The ancient Kingdom of Khotan was one of the earliest Buddhist states in the world and a cultural bridge across which Buddhist culture and learning were transmitted from India to China. Its capital was located to the west of the modern city of Hotan. The inhabitants of the Kingdom of Khotan, like those of early Kashgar and Yarkant, spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. Khotan&#x27;s indigenous dynasty (all of whose royal names are Indian in origin) governed a fervently Buddhist city-state boasting some 400 temples in the late 9th/early 10th century—four times the number recorded by Xuanzang around 630. The kingdom was independent but was intermittently under Chinese control during the Han and Tang dynasties.

After the Tang dynasty, Khotan formed an alliance with the rulers of Dunhuang. Khotan enjoyed close relations with the Buddhist centre at Dunhuang: the Khotanese royal family intermarried with Dunhuang élites, visited and patronized Dunhuang&#x27;s Buddhist temple complex, and donated money to have their portraits painted on the walls of the Mogao grottos. Through the 10th century, Khotanese royal portraits were painted in association with an increasing number of deities in the caves. Besides this, a particular site, Melikawat functioned as a major Buddhist center in the Kingdom of Khotan.

In the 10th century, Khotan began a struggle with the Kara-Khanid Khanate, a Turkic state. The Kara-Khanid ruler, Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, had converted to Islam:
Some Khotanese Buddhist works were unearthed.

The rulers of Khotan were aware of the menace they faced since they arranged for the Mogao grottoes to paint a growing number of divine figures along with themselves. Halfway in the 10th century Khotan came under attack by the Qarakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.

===Islamic Khotan===
Yūsuf Qadr Khān was a brother or cousin of the Muslim ruler of Kashgar and Balasagun, Khotan lost its independence and between 1006 and 1165, became part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate. Later it fell to the Kara-Khitan Khanate, after which it was ruled by the Mongols.

When Marco Polo visited Khotan in the 13th century, he noted that the people were all Muslim. He wrote that:
===Qing period===

The Qing dynasty of China conquered the Dzungar Khanate during the final stage of the Dzungar–Qing Wars in the late 1750s. By 1760, Hotan became the territory of the Qing dynasty along with the rest of Xinjiang. The town suffered severely during the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) against the Qing rule and again a few years later when Yaqub Beg of Kashgar made himself master of Kashgaria, ruling the newly founded Turkic state known at the time as Yettishar. However, Xinjiang was reconquered by the Qing dynasty by 1877 and was converted into a province in 1884.

===Post-Qing===

Qing imperial authority collapsed in 1912. During the Republican era in China, warlords and local ethnic self-determination movements wrestled over control of Xinjiang. Abdullah Bughra, Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra, and Muhammad Amin Bughra declared themselves Emirs of Khotan during the Kumul Rebellion. Tunganistan was an independent administered region in the southern part of Xinjiang from 1934 to 1937. The territory included the oases of the southern Tarim Basin; the centre of the region was Khotan. Beginning with the Islamic rebellion in 1937, Hotan and the rest of the province came under the control of warlord Sheng Shicai. Sheng was later ousted by the Kuomintang.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Shortly after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, Hotan was incorporated into the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 1983/4, the urban area of Hotan was administratively split from the larger Hotan County, and from then on governed as a county-level city.

On July 11, 2006, the townships of Jiya and Yurungqash (Yulongkashi) in Lop County and Tusalla (Tushala) in Hotan County were transferred to Hotan City.

Following the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, ethnic tensions rose in Xinjiang and in Hotan in particular. As a result, the city has seen occasional bouts of violence. In June 2011, Hotan opened its first passenger-train service to Kashgar, which was established as a special economic zone following the riots. In July of the same year, a bomb and knife attack occurred on the city&#x27;s central thoroughfare. In June 2011, authorities in Hotan Prefecture sentenced Uyghur Muslim Hebibullah Ibrahim to ten years imprisonment for selling &quot;illegal religious materials&quot;. In June 2012, Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554 was hijacked en route from Hotan to Ürümqi.

In a report from the Uyghur American Association, in June 2012, notice was said to be given that police planned to undertake a search of every residence in Gujanbagh (Gujiangbage), Hotan. Hotan is the last municipality in Xinjiang with a majority Ugyhur presence in the core of the city. The UAA viewed this as an attempt to systematically intimidate the Uyghur population in Hotan.

The Sultanim Cemetery () in central Hotan was a historical Uyghur graveyard that also included a religious shrine. According to a 2019 interview by the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the cemetery entombed four commanders of Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, who conquered the city around 960 CE and spread Islam. Due to space limitations after over a thousand years of burials, multiple bodies had to reuse the same grave, and additionals layers were dug underneath old ones. Between 2018 and 2019, the cemetery was demolished and the western part of the land turned into a parking lot.

==Geography and climate==

Hotan has a temperate zone, cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with a mean annual total of only of precipitation falling on 17.3 days of the year. Due to its southerly location in Xinjiang just north of the Kunlun Mountains, during winter it is one of the warmest locations in the region, with average high temperatures remaining above freezing throughout the year. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . The diurnal temperature variation is not large for a desert, averaging annually. Although no month averages less than half of possible sunshine, the city only receives 2,587 hours of bright sunshine annually, which is on the low end for Xinjiang; monthly percent possible sunshine ranges from 50% in March to 75% in October.

==Administrative divisions==

The city includes four subdistricts, three towns, five townships and two other areas:


Others:
* Beijing Industrial Park (), Hotan City Jinghe Logistics Park ()

==Demographics==

Hotan is largely dominated by the Uyghurs, and as of 2015, 311,050 of the 348,289 residents of the county were Uyghur, 35,897 were Han Chinese and 1,342 were from other ethnic groups.

In 1940, Owen Lattimore quoted the population of Khotan to be estimated as 26,000.

In 1998 the urban population was recorded at 154,352, 83% of which were Uyghurs, and 17% were Han Chinese.

In 1999, 83.01% of the population was Uyghur and 16.57% of the population was Han Chinese.

In the 2000 census, the population was recorded as 186,123. In the 2010 census figure, the figure had risen to 322,300. The increase in population is partly due to boundary changes.

==Transportation==
===Air===
Hetian Kungang Airport (IATA: HTN) serves the city. It serves regional flights to Ürümqi. Originally a military use airport, it was expanded significantly in 2002 to accommodate higher passenger volumes. It is located south of the city proper.

===Road===
Hotan is served by China National Highway 315, which runs along the southern Tarim Basin from Ruoqiang to Kashgar, and the Trans-Taklamakan Desert Highway, which run north to Luntai. An expressway is being built between Hotan and Karakax County (Moyu) as of 2014.

===Rail===
Hotan is connected to the rest of China&#x27;s rail network via the Kashgar–Hotan Railway, which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011. The railway station was constructed by a company under the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and is located in the town of Lasqi () northwest of the city proper. Passenger train service on this line is limited, with only one train per day, local service 5828/5825, linking the city with Kashgar (8~ hours) and Ürümqi (~34 hours).

===Buses===
Regular bus services link Hotan with Kashgar. There is also an express bus to Aksu via the &#x27;Hotan-Aksu Cross-Desert Highway&#x27; which was opened in 2007, travels alongside the intermittent Hotan River, and which takes about 5 or 6 hours. This same bus then goes on to Urumchi taking a total of about 21 hours from Hotan.

==Economy==

, there was about 100,000 acres (662,334 &quot;mu&quot;) of cultivated land in Khotan.

===Nephrite jade===
Chinese historical sources indicate that Hotan was the main source of the nephrite jade used in ancient China. For several hundred years, until they were defeated by the Xiongnu in 176 BCE, the trade of Khotanese jade into China was controlled by the nomadic Yuezhi. The Chinese still refer to the Yurungkash as the White Jade River, alluding to the white jade recovered from its alluvial deposits. The light-colored jade is called &quot;Mutton fat&quot; jade. Most of the jade is now gone, with only a few kilos of good quality jade found yearly. Some is still mined in the Kunlun Mountains to the south in the summer, but it is generally of poorer quality than that found in the rivers.

===Fabrics and carpets===

Khotanese textiles were mentioned by Xuanzang, who visited the oasis in 644 CE. In his Biography it is stated: &quot;It produced carpets and fine felt, and the felt-makers also spun coarse and fine silk.&quot;

Ancient Chinese-Khotanese relations were so close that the oasis emerged as one of the earliest centres of silk manufacture outside China. There are good reasons to believe that the silk-producing industry flourished in Hotan as early as the 5th century. According to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a Khotan prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk-manufacture, &quot;hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry&quot;, probably in the first half of the 1st century CE. It was from Khotan that the eggs of silkworms were smuggled to Iran, reaching Justinian I&#x27;s Constantinople in 551.Silk production is still a major industry employing more than a thousand workers and producing some 150 million metres of silk annually. Silk weaving by Uyghur women is a thriving cottage industry, some of it produced using traditional methods. 

Atlas is the fabric used for traditional Uyghur clothing worn by Uyghur women. It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colors, the brighter and rich colors are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colors are for elderly women.

The oldest piece of kilim which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer Aurel Stein; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE. The weave is almost identical with that of modern kilims.

Hotanese pile carpets are still highly prized and form an important export.

<text>King Echetus (; ), in Greek mythology, is a king of Epirus and son of Euchenor and Phlogea ().

==Mythology==
He is mentioned in Book 18 of Homer&#x27;s Odyssey, as well as in Book 21 in which he is described as the &quot;destroyer of all mortals&quot; by Antinous (one of the suitors).

In Book 18, the beggar Irus was threatened with being handed over to Echetus, who would then have had Irus&#x27; nose, ears and testes cut off and thrown to his dogs. The story also described how Echetus had a daughter, Metope, who had an intrigue with a lover; as a punishment Echetus mutilated the lover and blinded Metope by piercing her eyes with bronze needles. He then incarcerated her in a tower and gave her grains of bronze, promising that she would regain her sight when she had ground these grains into flour.

Eustathius and the scholia on this passage call the daughter and her lover Amphissa and Aechmodicus respectively.

==Theories on the basis of Echetus==
It is thought that Echetus was a mythological creation, used to scare disobedient children or used as the villain in bedtime stories. An alternate theory is that Echetus was a real king around the time of Homer, and that he was quite deformed and possibly a cannibal; no evidence currently exists to support this theory, however.

<text>The were the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Satsuma han, which spread over Satsuma, Ōsumi and Hyūga provinces in Japan.

The Shimazu were identified as one of the &quot;tozama&quot; or outsider &quot;daimyō&quot; families in contrast with the &quot;fudai&quot; or insider clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.

==History==
The Shimazu were descendants of the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto. The Shimazu would become one of the families of Edo period &quot;daimyō&quot; to have held their territory continuously since the Kamakura period, and would also become, at their peak, the wealthiest and most powerful Tozama daimyō family with an income in excess of 700,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

The founder, Shimazu Tadahisa (d. 1227), was a son of &quot;Shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) with the sister of Hiki Yoshikazu. Tadahisa&#x27;s wife was a daughter of Koremune Hironobu, a descendant of the Hata clan, whose name Tadahisa took at first. He received the domain of Shioda in Shinano Province in 1186 and was then named &quot;shugo&quot; of Satsuma Province. He sent Honda Sadachika to take possession of the province in his name and accompanied Yoritomo in his expedition to Mutsu in 1189. He went to Satsuma in 1196, subdued the Hyūga and Ōsumi provinces, and built a castle in the Hyūga Province as part of the Shimazu Estate, whose name he also adopted.

Shimazu Yoshihisa (1533–1611) was the 16th Head of Shimazu family and the eldest son of Shimazu Takahisa. In 1586, he succeeded in unifying and controlling the entire Kyushu region. He retired in 1587 after Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s Kyushu Campaign.

The 17th head, Yoshihiro (1535–1619), was the &quot;daimyō&quot; at the time of the Battle of Sekigahara, the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, and the Siege of Osaka. His nephew and successor was Tadatsune. He held significant power during the first two decades of the 17th century, and organized the Shimazu invasion of the Ryūkyū Kingdom (modern-day Okinawa Prefecture) in 1609. The &quot;Shōgun&quot; allowed this because he wished to appease the Shimazu and prevent potential uprisings after their loss at Sekigahara. The trade benefits thus acquired, and the political prestige of being the only &quot;daimyō&quot; family to control an entire foreign country secured the Shimazu&#x27;s position as one of the most powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; families in Japan at the time.
The Shimazu clan was renowned for the loyalty of its retainers and officers, especially during the Sengoku period. Some retainer families, such as the Ijuin and Shirakawa, were determined to defeat any opposition to help expand the power of the Shimazu clan. The Shimazu are also famous for being the first to use &quot;teppo&quot; (firearms, specifically matchlock arquebuses) on the battlefield in Japan, and began domestic production of the weapons as well. Shimazu battle tactics are known to have been very successful in defeating larger enemy armies, particularly during their campaign to conquer Kyūshū in the 1580s. Their tactics included the luring of the opposition into an ambush on both sides by arquebus troops, creating panic and disorder. Central forces would then be deployed to rout the enemy. In this way, the Shimazu were able to defeat much larger clans such as the Itō, Ryūzōji and Ōtomo. Overall, the Shimazu was a very large and powerful clan due to their strong economy both from domestic production through trade, good organization of government and troops, strong loyalty of retainers and isolation from Honshū.

In 1789, Shigehide (1745–1833)&#x27;s daughter became the wife of the 11th &quot;shogun&quot;, Tokugawa Ienari. In 1856, Nariakira (1809–1858)&#x27;s adopted daughter (Tenshō-in) became the wife of the 13th &quot;shogun&quot;, Tokugawa Iesada.

Hisamitsu (1817–1887), regent of Tadayoshi, was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma at the time of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration, in which Satsuma played a major role.

<text>The White Jade River, also known by the native names Baiyu or Yurungkash, is a river in the southern Xinjiang region of China.

The head waters of the river rise in the Kunlun Mountains, in the area of Aksai Chin in Kashmir in the Togatax area (). The river flows east for some 200 km and then north for another 200 km before passing through Khotan, China (). In Khotan, the river has yielded white river rocks which are also known as nephrite jade. 

North of Khotan, it eventually dries up in the Taklamakan Desert, its seasonal bed joined by that of the Black Jade River (Karakash River) near Koxlax (some 200 km north of Khotan, ), from where it continues north as the Hotan River, which flows into the Tarim River. The river drains an area of and has a discharge of .

The river gets its name from the white jade that is often found in its alluvial deposits. The jade can also however be found in semi-shallow areas of the river..

<doc id="720155" wikidata="Q2519257" url="?curid=720155" title="Doctor Manhattan">
<text>Doctor Manhattan (Dr. Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Osterman) is a fictional DC Comics character created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons. He debuted in the limited series graphic novel, &quot;Watchmen.&quot;

Following a laboratory accident, atomic physicist Jon Osterman develops the ability to observe and manipulate matter at a subatomic level. He is later given the tongue-in-cheek moniker &quot;Doctor Manhattan&quot; by the United States government, due to his limitless destructive potential. As he explores the extent of his powers, Jon grows increasingly distant in his personal life, as well as his understanding of the human experience. Jon&#x27;s de-humanization as a function of his newfound omnipotence has led many to liken him to a post-human god. Media analysts consider his characterization within the novel to be a key exploration of the tension between absolute power and the morality of its usage, and a commentary on American exceptionalism on the world stage in the late 20th century.

Doctor Manhattan later appeared in the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; comic book prequel. In 2016, as part of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Manhattan became a major character in the DC Universe. It was revealed that he was responsible for the creation of The New 52 timeline/universe, a factor that removed 10 years of DC characters&#x27; history. That led him to become one of the main characters in the &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; miniseries, published from 2017 to 2019.

Doctor Manhattan made his first live-action debut in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Billy Crudup. He also appeared in the 2019 limited television series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, with his original form played by Darrell Snedeger.

==Publication history==

Doctor Manhattan is partially based on DC Comics&#x27; Captain Atom, although he has more in common with Gold Key Comics&#x27; Solar. In Moore&#x27;s original proposal, Captain Atom was surrounded by the shadow of a nuclear threat. However, Moore found he could do more with Manhattan as &quot;a supreme super-hero&quot; than he ever could have done with Captain Atom. Moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum mechanics in constructing the character of Doctor Manhattan. He believed a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time from a linear perspective, which would influence the character&#x27;s perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like Spock from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, so he allowed Doctor Manhattan to retain &quot;human habits&quot;, but eventually grow away from them and humanity in general.

Gibbons had created the blue character Rogue Trooper, and reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it visualised electrical or atomic energy while still resembling human skin tonally and &quot;reading as Jon Osterman’s skin would’ve read, but in a different hue.&quot; Moore incorporated color into the story, and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic&#x27;s color scheme made Manhattan unique.

Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character. Gibbons wanted to tastefully depict Manhattan&#x27;s nudity, selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him &quot;understated&quot; genitals—like a classical sculpture—so the reader would not initially notice it. Dr. Manhattan&#x27;s forehead is marked with the atomic structure (specifically the Bohr model) of hydrogen, which he put on himself, declining a helmet with the atom symbol.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Jonathan Osterman is born in 1929 to a Jewish-American family of German descent. He plans to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a watchmaker, but when the U.S. drops the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, his father declares his profession outdated and forces Jon to work toward a career studying nuclear physics. This turning point foreshadows Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;exterior&quot; perception of time as predetermined and all things within it as so determined, including Manhattan&#x27;s reactions and emotions.

Jon attends Princeton University and graduates with a Ph.D. in atomic physics. In early 1959, he moves to a research base at Gila Flats, where experiments are being performed on the &quot;intrinsic fields&quot; of physical objects which, if tampered with, result in their disintegration. Here he meets Janey Slater, a fellow researcher; they eventually become lovers. During a visit to an amusement park in New Jersey, Janey&#x27;s wristwatch breaks and Jon promises to fix it. A month later, Jon realizes he left the repaired watch in his lab coat that&#x27;s inside a test chamber. When he goes inside to retrieve it the test chamber door closes behind him locking him inside. Researchers outside are unable to open the door or override the countdown, and the force of the generator tears Jon to pieces.

A series of strange events and ghostly appearances occur over the next few months, leading researchers to speculate that the area is haunted. After a series of partial bodily appearances, it becomes apparent that Jon is progressively re-forming himself. Each time, the appearance lasts for only a few seconds: first a disembodied nervous system including the brain and eyes; then a circulatory system; and then a partially muscled skeleton. Jon eventually reappears as a tall, muscular, hairless, naked, blue-skinned man, glowing with a &quot;flare of ultraviolet.&quot;

===Before &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
Jon gradually becomes a pawn of the U.S. government. It gives him the code name &quot;Doctor Manhattan&quot;—a reference to the Manhattan Project—and a costume that he begrudgingly accepts. Doctor Manhattan chooses a representation of a hydrogen atom as his emblem. He declares that its simplicity kindles his respect; accordingly, he painlessly burns the mark into his forehead. This preference for material mechanisms marks the beginning of his declining humanity. Over time, he sheds uniform bit by bit. By the end of the 1970s, he refuses to wear anything at all except during mandatory public appearances.

Dr. Manhattan&#x27;s presence tips the balance of the Cold War in the West&#x27;s favor, and as a result, U.S. foreign policy becomes more militaristic. At President Richard Nixon&#x27;s request, he secures an American victory in the Vietnam War, which allows Nixon to repeal the 22nd Amendment and serve up to five terms. Far from solving underlying international tensions, Manhattan&#x27;s presence exacerbates them while stifling their expression, which inevitably builds toward disaster. The entire plot of &quot;Watchmen&quot; occurs during the countdown to a nuclear war.

Manhattan spends much of his time conducting research. He is single-handedly responsible for the shift to electric-powered vehicles, and Adrian Veidt credits him with causing a huge leap forward in a myriad of science and technology sectors. As a result, the technology of the alternative 1985 of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe is far more advanced. During the only meeting of the Crimebusters group, Manhattan becomes attracted to Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre. His relationship with Janey ends acrimoniously and he begins dating Laurie.

===Events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
At the start of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Manhattan works at the Rockefeller Military Research Center, where he lives with Laurie. Rorschach informs them of the murder of Edward Blake, aka the Comedian, and warns them that all former costumed adventurers are being targeted by a &quot;mask killer.&quot; Because he works for the U.S. government, Manhattan is exempt from a federal law outlawing costumed heroes. Manhattan dismisses Rorschach by teleporting him outside and encourages Laurie to go out with Dan Dreiberg, the second Nite Owl. A short time later, Manhattan attends Blake&#x27;s funeral with Veidt and Dreiberg. He reflects on his association with Blake during the Vietnam War, and senses the presence of former villain, Moloch.

During a talk show appearance, a reporter ambushes Manhattan with allegations that he caused cancer in his former associates, including Janey. Seeking solitude, Manhattan transports himself to Mars. The Soviet Union exploits his absence by invading Afghanistan, sparking an international crisis. Eventually, Manhattan brings Laurie to Mars to discuss why he should aid humanity. Laurie inadvertently wins the argument after the shocking realization that her father is Blake, a man she despised for sexually assaulting her mother. Manhattan is amazed by the improbable events that occurred to result in the birth of Laurie, a chain of events he sees as a stunning &quot;thermodynamic miracle.&quot; Realizing that such a miracle can apply to any living thing on Earth, Manhattan is persuaded to return to protect humanity, rather than disregarding it as insignificant.

It is discovered that Veidt framed Manhattan. It was part of his plot to avert World War III by attacking New York with an engineered monster, killing half of the city in the process. Although Manhattan and Laurie return too late to stop Veidt, they teleport to his base in Antarctica to confront him. Veidt tries to disintegrate Manhattan, only to have Manhattan restore himself more quickly than Veidt expected. Upon seeing that Veidt&#x27;s plan has averted war, Manhattan realizes that exposing him would be too dangerous for life on Earth and agrees to remain silent. Rorschach leaves intending to expose the truth, causing Manhattan to vaporize him. Manhattan decides to depart Earth again, suggesting that he desires to find a galaxy &quot;less complicated than this one.&quot; When Veidt asks if his plan worked out in the end, Manhattan replies, &quot;In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends.&quot;

===In the DC Universe===
==== &quot;The New 52&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; ====
After departing from the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe, Manhattan was aware of the DC Universe being filled with hope inside humanity and traveled there to find a place among those people and start a new life. But at some point, his visions showed him an arms race among metahumans that caused an incoming &quot;World War III&quot;, leading Manhattan to have a confrontation with Superman, and then he saw &quot;nothing&quot;. This revelation led Manhattan to modify the DC Universe&#x27;s mainstream timeline to fix the fissures caused by the several Crises across the Multiverse; unaware it was the doing of Perpetua to free herself from the Source Wall. However, those actions would not get the expected result and would lead to the creation of The New 52.

During the events of &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, Manhattan deceived Pandora into convincing Barry Allen to merge three separate timelines (the DC Universe, the Wildstorm Universe, and select Vertigo titles) to create Prime Earth. The merger enabled him to erase ten years from the reverted universe, which not only reversed the age of its inhabitants by ten years but also caused the multiple resurrections of several deceased characters.

In the new timeline, Manhattan prevents the last wizard of the Council of Eternity from revealing to Pandora how to open the skull-shaped box, and kills Owlman and Metron after the former tries to access the secrets of the universe. However, the Convergence caused by Brainiac and Telos restored the Multiverse, bringing back the pre-Flashpoint timeline.

Doctor Manhattan used Abra Kadabra to trap Wally West within the Speed Force, and this modification in the timeline also caused the other speedsters Jesse Quick, Bart Allen, Jay Garrick, and Max Mercury to be removed from history and trapped in the Speed Force. However Wally West was saved by Barry, therefore initiating the events of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;. Doctor Manhattan then kills Pandora after she finally realizes that he was the one responsible for all of the sins for which she had been blamed. Barry and Batman later began investigating the unknown force behind these changes, learning from Lilith Clay that &quot;Manhattan&quot; was a prominent thought in Kadabra&#x27;s mind when he claimed responsibility for removing Wally from history.

Eobard Thawne attacks Batman as he is studying a blood-stained smiley face button left embedded within the wall of the Batcave. When Thawne picks up the button, he is briefly teleported away, returning with the left half of his body charred to the bone. Just before his death, he claims to have seen &quot;God.&quot; Using the cosmic treadmill to chase after the radiation emitted from the button in the timestream, Batman and Barry discover Thawne as he was trying to reach &quot;God.&quot; Upon reaching the unseen figure, Thawne boosted his ability to exist as a paradox before he was vaporized by Manhattan, leaving only the button behind. Sometime later, Manhattan picks up the button as he recalls his dialogue with Laurie.

Manhattan puts Bruce Wayne in contact with the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; Thomas Wayne, who tells his son not to become Batman before his &quot;death&quot; and the destruction of the last of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline, prompting Bruce not to respond to the Bat-Signal the following night. Manhattan also saves Jor-El from the destruction of Krypton before conditioning him to see only the very worst of humanity. Jor-El assumes the identity of Mister Oz and tries to convince his son Kal-El, or Superman, to abandon Earth. However, when Jor-El begins to realize that he has been pushing against his son too far, he is pulled away. Superman acknowledges Jor-El&#x27;s warnings even as he rejects his misanthropy. All of which was to test the will and hope of the two major heroes of the DC Universes.

During the events of &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot;, Batman suspects that the massacre in Sanctuary might be related to Manhattan&#x27;s actions. This theory was later proven to be partially true, as Wally gets in contact with Metron&#x27;s Mobius Chair, which grants him part of Manhattan&#x27;s powers.

==== Events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; ====
During the events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, seven years after the events set in the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe, Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt) is determined to find Doctor Manhattan to restore the world from the chaos after his previous plan for world peace was exposed by Rorschach&#x27;s journal. Veidt narrates that he can track Doctor Manhattan because Doctor Manhattan leaks electrons as his intrinsic field were stripped during his initial accident and an event caused by Veidt. Using the Owlship to the quantum tunnel, accompanied by Rorschach II, Marionette, and Mime, Veidt follows the electron trail left by Doctor Manhattan to the DC Universe where they land in Gotham City. Later, it is revealed that Doctor Manhattan is responsible for preventing the Comedian&#x27;s death by teleporting him to the DC Universe.

Doctor Manhattan recalls various events in which he indirectly killed Alan Scott and thus brought about changes in the timeline. On July 16, 1940, Alan Scott was riding on a train over a collapsing bridge, but he survived by grabbing onto a green lantern. He continues his life, eventually &quot;sitting at a round table wearing a mask&quot; and later testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee but refusing to implicate anyone in his employ. On July 16, 1940, again, Doctor Manhattan moves the green lantern six inches out of his reach so that Alan Scott dies in the train accident and leaves no family behind, as the green lantern is passed through different locations. At a fun house in the present time, Bubastis II begins glowing, so Ozymandias moves him closer to the lantern to let him feed on Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s temporal energies left on the lantern and thereby force Doctor Manhattan to their current location. Doctor Manhattan immediately proceeds to transport himself and the Watchmen group away, separating them from Batman and Joker. He tells Ozymandias that he isn&#x27;t returning to their world as he&#x27;s in the middle of something. He reveals that he didn&#x27;t kill Marionette in the robbery years back, because he saw what her child would do and that she is pregnant again. He also reveals that Ozymandias lied to Rorschach about having cancer, so Ozymandias admits to Rorschach that he deceived him and used him for his help. Doctor Manhattan then tells everyone that he came to the DC Universe looking for a place among them, but that he saw a vision of &quot;the most hopeful among them. Heading toward [him]. Now hopeless,&quot; and then nothing in the future thereafter. Doctor Manhattan returns the team to the funhouse. He returns to Mars, reflecting on a vision set one month in his future: a confrontation with Superman that may result in Superman destroying Doctor Manhattan or Doctor Manhattan destroying everything.

On Mars, looking at a Legion Flight Ring that once belonged to Ferro Lad, Doctor Manhattan contemplates the events where Ferro Lad sacrificed his life to save Earth&#x27;s sun and thereby caused his ring to careen through time, the events in which he moved Alan Scott&#x27;s lantern and thereby caused the ring never to have existed, and his confrontation with Superman set one week from then. On Earth, Batman and Superman are recovering from a massive explosion, which has produced a fog of tachyon particles that obscures the immediate past and future to Doctor Manhattan. Meanwhile, after tracing the energy signature of the explosion to Mars, many of Earth&#x27;s superheroes travel in several spaceships to Mars for a confrontation with the suspected perpetrator. However, Batman believes that they are being &quot;played,&quot; as he is unsure if they have the right person. With the heroes surrounding Doctor Manhattan, Martian Manhunter telepathically broadcasts Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s final vision of Superman to everyone. The heroes believe that Doctor Manhattan is trying to destroy Superman and all of them before Superman destroys him. As Doctor Manhattan easily deals with the attacks by the heroes, he curiously examines and discloses the nature of the emotional spectrum by dissecting Guy Gardner&#x27;s power ring and stating that the magic used by the Justice League Dark is from the &quot;scraps of Creation.&quot; To prove the point that even hope decays, he shows Ronnie Raymond that Professor Martin Stein purposely caused the circumstances where Raymond and Stein merged into Firestorm to learn more about metahumans from the inside. Back on Mars, refusing to believe the events of the past that were shown, Firestorm attacks and harms Doctor Manhattan upon which the heroes realize that Doctor Manhattan is not invulnerable and destroy him. However, the superheroes watch in shock as Doctor Manhattan reconstitutes himself before he attacks and incapacitates them.

As he incapacitates the remaining heroes, Doctor Manhattan recounts the first time he arrived in the DC Universe on April 18, 1938. He meets Carver Colman. As they talk in a diner, Doctor Manhattan sees all moments of Carver&#x27;s future until his death before April 19, 1955. Overhearing news of a mysterious man who lifted a car over his head, Doctor Manhattan leaves and witnesses the first appearance of the Golden Age Superman. From there, he witnesses the beginnings of Alan Scott/Green Lantern, Jay Garrick/The Flash, Hawkman, Atom, Doctor Fate, Sandman, Spectre, and Hourman, and the formation of the Justice Society of America. Doctor Manhattan then sees a different timeline where Superman was never a member of the JSA and first appeared in 1956 instead (Silver Age/Earth-1). Doctor Manhattan witnesses several variations of the death of Superman&#x27;s foster parents: Jonathan and Martha Kent, the origins of Superman, and also when a young Superboy met the Legion of Super-Heroes. To appease his curiosity, Doctor Manhattan moves the Green Lantern away from Alan Scott, preventing the creation of the Green Lantern and the formation of the JSA, to see how the changes affect Superman. In doing this, Doctor Manhattan realizes that this universe is not part of the Multiverse, but is the Metaverse, with the Multiverse reacting to the changes within this universe (hence why there have been endless parallel worlds, none at all, 52 universes, and a Dark Multiverse). Having changed history in the Metaverse, Doctor Manhattan created the New 52 Universe, and as he witnesses the first appearance of the New 52 Superman, he is confronted by Wally West of the Pre-Flashpoint Universe, who briefly escapes the Speed Force to warn him that he knows what Doctor Manhattan did and that the heroes of the DC Universe will stop him, before being dragged back into the Speed Force. Doctor Manhattan likens Wally&#x27;s appearance to the Metaverse fighting back at the changes done to it, an innate hope that fights back to the surface. He returns to Carver Colman on June 8, 1954, 10 seconds before he is killed by his mother, and he thinks about the future he sees where Superman attacks him, believing that he will either die by Superman&#x27;s hands or destroy the Metaverse. Back to the present day, Doctor Manhattan returns to Earth and ponders that he is a being of inaction on a collision course with a man of action (Superman), and to this universe of hope, he has become the villain.

After arriving on Earth, Manhattan meets Superman in person during Black Adam&#x27;s invasion of the White House, with Ozymandias watching. Manhattan witnesses Superman&#x27;s fight with Black Adam and Russia&#x27;s superhero team called the People&#x27;s Heroes. He eventually reveals to Superman that he is the one who has been tampering with reality and that he also caused the death of Jonathan and Martha Kent. Manhattan expects Superman to attack him, but Superman instead protects him from Pozhar and then tells him that he should use his powers for good. Manhattan is inspired by Superman&#x27;s heroism and his pivotal role in the fabric of reality; he undoes part of his actions, restoring much of the pre-New 52 timelines. Many characters are brought back into existence, including Superman&#x27;s parents. Manhattan also goes back in time and changes Carver Colman&#x27;s future for the better. He then goes back to the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe, bringing Rorschach and Ozymandias with him. Manhattan saves his Earth by making all nuclear weapons disappear. Afterward, he takes Mime and Marionette&#x27;s infant son with him and proceeds to raise him on his own, so he will become their planet&#x27;s equivalent to Superman. His final thought wanders to what his life could have been if he had not become Doctor Manhattan: Janey convinces him to not retrieve the watch so he is not involved in the incident that would have given him his powers; he marries Janey and they start a family together, having two daughters and a son, living a life without any worry of time. He smiles one last time, believing it to be a nice daydream to live in. Doctor Manhattan then erases himself from existence, transferring his life force to the Planet and his powers to Mime and Marionette&#x27;s son. He leaves the boy—whom he has named Clark—to be adopted by the former Nite Owl and Silk Spectre.

==== After &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;====
During the events of &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, Wally West reveals Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s energy is Connective Energy, and after he restored the DC Universe, the Quintessence&#x27;s members used that same energy against Perpetua. The Batman Who Laughs takes Wally prisoner to get Manhattan&#x27;s powers, but Wonder Woman suggests using both the Connective and Crisis Energies to create an &quot;Anti-Crisis&quot;. The event also features the &quot;Final Bruce Wayne,&quot; an amalgamated version of Batman and Doctor Manhattan created when an alternate-universe Batman recreates the accident that transformed Doctor Manhattan into a god-like being. The Batman Who Laughs was able to capture this alternate and extract his brain before he could properly harness his powers, allowing the Batman Who Laughs to transplant himself into the body, transforming the villain into &quot;The Darkest Knight&quot; to create a Multiverse consisting of chaos.

==Characterization==
===Appearance===
Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s body is humanoid, and his build is tall and muscular. His height and relative size vary depending on his needs but generally remain above tall. He is completely blue (altering his shade and luminosity at will) and has no hair. On his forehead, he has etched a stylized image of a hydrogen atom. He did this during preparations by the military for his unveiling to the general public. They presented him with a hat as a part of his uniform that had a group of crossed ellipses on it, intended to look like an atom but Jon did not see the resemblance. He replaced it with a symbol of his own, saying that if he were to have a symbol it should at least be one that he respects.

As Doctor Manhattan, his costume started as a black leotard, which presumably he created. As time progressed the costume shrank progressively to a pair of shorts, then a brief, then a thong; he eventually went on to wear nothing at all, since he had become indifferent to the need for clothing. The only purpose his original costume served was to make those around him (including the general public) more comfortable.

Before the experiment, Jon Osterman was a human of average height. He had brown hair and brown eyes. As a physicist, he often wore a suit.

===Personality===
Dr. Manhattan, though supremely powerful, suffers from a decreasing ability to relate to normal humans. Perhaps due to his perception of time and realization of the deterministic universe, he begins to show symptoms of apathy. From his radically altered perspective, almost all human concerns appear pointless and without obvious merit.

He describes Laurie as his only remaining link to humanity. This is demonstrated when the relationship ends, and Doctor Manhattan leaves Earth. This is also due to evidence coming to light that a number of those who were once close to him, including his former girlfriend Janey Slater, have come down with terminal cancer. Manhattan feels that he poses a threat to others, and he exiles himself to Mars, stating &quot;I am tired of Earth, these people. I&#x27;m tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.&quot; His interest in humanity is revived after he witnesses Laurie&#x27;s epiphany that she is the daughter of the Comedian. It causes him to reflect on the sheer chance that life should come to be in any form, but after the Watchmen fail to prevent Ozymandias&#x27;s destruction of New York, he departs Earth, commenting that he may explore new life in other parts of the galaxy.

In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; #1, Pandora accuses her killer — currently thought to be Doctor Manhattan — of believing in skepticism, doubt, and corruption, proclaiming that he cannot understand the hope personified in the heroes of the DC Universe and that they will &quot;prove [him] wrong&quot;.

His meddling with the DC Universe to satisfy his curiosity shows extreme apathy. He has altered the timeline so much, that several events and people were altered or wiped out. However, thanks to the Convergence, Wally West and Superman, much of the damage was undone, though Manhattan wasn&#x27;t deterred from continuing his experiment. He erased the Golden Age by preventing Alan Scott from getting his powers and helping form the JSA, in the process erasing the Legion of Super-Heroes as well. He remained indifferent to a survivor who avoided erasure.

In the last &quot;Watchmen&quot; issue, Manhattan claimed that &quot;nothing ends&quot; despite Ozymandias succeeding in his plan for world peace. But in &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Manhattan withdrew from what he previously said after witnessing the DC Universe&#x27;s citizens losing their faith in their heroes, now affirming that &quot;everything ends&quot;. His sole interest was in the moment Superman was to punch at him; a moment he couldn&#x27;t see past. In irony, Manhattan was the antithesis of Superman, being a human who had lost all senses of humanity; while Superman was an alien who embodied the best of humanity.

When the foretold moment came, Manhattan revealed he was responsible for erasing Superman&#x27;s loved ones; however, he was shocked that the punch was meant to knock away a villain behind him. Superman sought only to help and be better, which Manhattan saw as the answer; the entire DC multiverse created new worlds for Superman to be born in every era until the 31st century, when his ideals brought peace.

After resorting to the JSA and Legion, Manhattan decided his world and multiverse could use someone like Superman, but Manhattan himself was too detached from his humanity; so, he would need to raise a child and impart his powers to him. To this end, he raises Clark Maez, Mime, and Marionette&#x27;s son, before leaving him to be adopted by his former teammates.

===Powers and abilities===
Jon is the only character in &quot;Watchmen&quot; to possess superpowers. Throughout &quot;Watchmen&quot;, he is shown to be absolutely powerful and invulnerable to all harm; even when his body is disintegrated, he can reconstruct it in a matter of seconds and remains unharmed. He is capable of altering his size depending on his needs, for example, reconstructing himself in a much bigger form. He can hurl huge objects effortlessly with his hands. He is also unable to exhaust himself. Jon has complete awareness of and control over atomic and subatomic particles. He is also an omnikinetic. He does not need air, water, food, or sleep, and is immortal. He can teleport himself and others over limitless distances. He is capable of true flight, although he uses only levitation in most of his appearances. Due to his perception of time, he sees the past, present, and future simultaneously.

Jon can phase any part of his body through solid objects without damaging them, produce multiple copies of himself that function independently of each other, project destructive energy, instantaneously disintegrate people with a mere thought (seen when he did so to fleeing soldiers during the Vietnam War) and generate impenetrable force fields. He can transmute, create, and destroy matter as well as transmute his body to any of a vast array of elemental compounds and form them to his will. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Additionally, he can shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can move objects without physically touching them (telekinesis), reverse entropy, repair anything, no matter how damaged. In addition, he has the ability to create life, or so he claims. He also attests to have walked on the surface of the sun. At one point it is stated that, in the event of a nuclear war, he would be capable of destroying Soviet nuclear missiles while at the same time &#x27;destroying&#x27; large areas of Russia. As a result of these capabilities, Jon becomes central to the United States Cold War strategy of deterrence.

He is also capable of manipulating reality through the use of time manipulation, as seen when he unaware of the consequences erased ten years from the DC Universe when Barry Allen tried to bring his original universe back to normal. Jon&#x27;s intervention caused The New 52 timeline to be formed after Perpetua recreated the multiverse, within which most superheroes are younger and less experienced, and most of them lose their most important relationships before they begin. However, despite his immense power, he was unable to erase or permanently kill Eobard Thawne, the Reverse-Flash.

In the DC Universe, Manhattan&#x27;s power is revealed to be glowing with Connective Energy, the opposite of Crisis Energy.

====Scientific accuracy====
In the 2009 film adaptation &quot;Watchmen&quot;, physics professor James Kakalios of the University of Minnesota was used as a scientific consultant, and shed light on the potential scientific explanations of Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s powers both in the film and the comic.
Kakalios explained that the intrinsic field has a basis in reality in that it is a representation of a collection of electromagnetic, and strong and weak nuclear forces. Kakalios explained that if a being were able to manipulate matter, such a being would have complete control over these three forces; hence, the &quot;intrinsic field&quot; would exist. Kakalios also explained that while it is unlikely, Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s teleportation abilities seemingly could be achieved through quantum tunnelling, should Doctor Manhattan have control over his probability wave functions.

===Philosophical implications===
The character of Doctor Manhattan invokes thought on the philosophy of metaphysics. There are various themes addressed throughout the &quot;Watchmen&quot; series from philosophy of time and eternalism, to determinism and its relationship to ethics, to addressing questions such as &quot;What does it mean to be human?&quot; and &quot;Do the ends justify the means?&quot;

The character is primarily cited as the representation of the potential side effects and dangers of a superintelligence, which include detachment from the rest of humanity and potential characteristics of apathy.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Doctor Manhattan appears in &quot;&quot;, where he, along with every other character in the series, is voiced by Tom Stechschulte.
* Doctor Manhattan appears in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, primarily portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, with his original form portrayed by Darrell Snedeger and his younger self by Zak Rothera-Oxley. He first appears as Cal Abar, who is the husband of Angela Abar, a.k.a. Sister Night. It is revealed that despite his progressive detachment from (and growth beyond) humanity, Manhattan has reversed course and once again desired love and a relationship with a woman. He is eventually destroyed, but, it is implied that he transferred some of his powers to Angela.

===Film===

* Doctor Manhattan appears in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, portrayed by Billy Crudup with Greg Plitt&#x27;s physical likeness with Jaryd Heidrick playing the young Jon Osterman in flashbacks. In the film, Ozymandias uses Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s energy research to destroy several large cities across the globe, framing him and using him as a scapegoat to attain peace. Jon corners Adrian at Karnak and like in the books, leaves Laurie for Mars, having killed Rorschach.
*Doctor Manhattan appears in the 2024 two-part animated film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, voiced by Michael Cerveris.

===Video games===
* Doctor Manhattan appears in a cutscene in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Crispin Freeman.

==References in other works==
* In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2, the exiled Monitor Nix Uotan sketches a character resembling Doctor Manhattan. Grant Morrison stated in an interview that the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; two-part series &quot;Superman: Beyond&quot; will feature &quot;Captain Atom from Earth 4, which is kind of a weird amalgam of the original Charlton universe and this kind of &quot;Watchmen&quot; parallel world.&quot; This character is named &#x27;Captain Adam&#x27;, and appears in &quot;Superman Beyond&quot; #1. He is blue-skinned with the hydrogen atom mark of Doctor Manhattan, and is addicted to drugs which keep his &quot;quantum senses&quot; in check. When he is off the drugs, he becomes similar to Doctor Manhattan in demeanor and powers, duplicating himself hundreds of times over to repair the Bleed Starship and allow the various Supermen to pilot the Thought-Robot Armor, which itself is confirmed to grant one powers capable of beating Captain Adam. However, even when he is using his full potential without the aid of drugs, Captain Adam has difficulty controlling his powers - an issue dissimilar from Doctor Manhattan.

<doc id="720167" wikidata="Q4557266" url="?curid=720167" title="Hoberman sphere">
<text>A Hoberman sphere is a kinetic structure patented by Chuck Hoberman that resembles a geodesic dome, but is capable of folding down to a fraction of its normal size by the scissor-like action of its joints. Colorful plastic versions have become popular as children&#x27;s toys: several toy sizes exist, with the original design capable of expanding from in diameter to .

==Description==
A Hoberman sphere typically consists of six great circles corresponding to the edges of an icosidodecahedron. The Hoberman sphere can be unfolded by allowing certain members to spread apart. The operation of each joint is linked to all the others in a scissors mechanism like those used to mount pantograph mirrors, or how a folding chair operates. In larger models, this can be accomplished by feeding out a string or cable instead.

The largest existing Hoberman sphere is in the AHHAA Science Center in Tartu, Estonia. Fully expanded, it is in diameter. The motorized sphere weighs , is constructed of aircraft-grade aluminum, and continually oscillates between its compact and expanded states. The sphere is suspended above the center&#x27;s Science Court and is actuated with a computer-based motion control system. This system opens and closes the sphere in a programmed series of lyrical motions choreographed to music, lighting and special effects.

An earlier, similar but slightly smaller Hoberman sphere is in the atrium of Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. The sphere, when fully expanded, measures in diameter.

In 1993 a smaller geodesic sphere was installed at the Swiss Science Center Technorama in Winterthur, Switzerland.

<doc id="720168" wikidata="Q5012315" url="?curid=720168" title="CKCK-FM">
<text>CKCK-FM is a radio station in Regina, Saskatchewan. Owned by Rawlco Communications, it broadcasts an adult hits format branded as &quot;Jack 94.5&quot;. CKCK&#x27;s studios and offices are located at 2401 Saskatchewan Drive in Regina, along with sister stations CJME and CIZL-FM.

== History ==

In 1922, the Leader Publishing Company, owner of Regina&#x27;s two major newspapers, &quot;The Leader&quot; and the &quot;Regina Evening Post&quot;, hired Bert Hooper to run a new radio station. In the beginning, Hooper was the station&#x27;s only employee, but he soon hired a second announcer, Pete Parker. In 1923, Parker called a Regina Capitals hockey game on the station - the world&#x27;s first complete broadcast of a professional hockey game. Around the same time, the station conducted the British Empire&#x27;s first live remote broadcast of a church service.

The Sifton family bought the newspapers and the radio station in 1927, merging the newspapers into &quot;The Leader-Post&quot; in 1930.

CKCK was an affiliate of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission from 1933 to 1936 when it affiliated with the newly formed Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It remained a CBC affiliate until 1962 when the Trans-Canada Network was dissolved into CBC Radio. The Siftons obtained a television station licence, and signed CKCK-TV on the air in 1954.

The 1960s saw CKCK at its commercial peak, dominating the broadcast market in Regina and southeast Saskatchewan. By then, it had boosted its power to 5,000 watts. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial and Saskatchewan&#x27;s mostly flat land (with near-perfect soil conductivity), this was enough to provide at least secondary coverage of all of Saskatchewan&#x27;s densely populated area. Its signal also reached across the border into portions of North Dakota and Montana. But its massive market share started to erode in the early 1960s as rival CJME came under the ownership of the Rawlinson family, forerunner of Rawlco Communications, and switched from a &quot;beautiful music&quot; format to Top 40 rock music. CKCK cut back on its promotional arm in the belief that its ratings could not fall. Another rival, CKRM, switched from a middle-of-the-road (MOR) format to country music in 1971 and CBC Radio belatedly began building up CBK&#x27;s local news and current affairs staff. In 1976, CKCK-TV was sold, forcing members of the joint newsroom to &quot;choose sides.&quot; CKCK &quot;spun off&quot; an FM station, CKIT-FM, but it pursued a MOR format. By 1977, CKCK doubled its power to 10,000 watts, but this was not enough to stem the decline. It lost further ground when CKRM increased its sports programming, notably winning the rights to the CFL&#x27;s Saskatchewan Roughriders.

In the fall of 1991, CKCK switched from an adult contemporary format to oldies using the branding &quot;CK-62&quot;. Most evening programming was delivered by satellite. Local programming was progressively cut back until by 1996, the only local program left was the morning show. All other programming was delivered by satellite from Toronto.

CKCK was acquired by Craig Media in 1996. In 1998, Craig signed a local management agreement with Harvard Communications, owner of CKRM, in which Harvard took over the station&#x27;s operations.

Finally, as a result of a complex ownership transaction between Craig, Harvard and Rawlco Communications, Harvard took over ownership of CKCK and shut it down. Harvard then sold CKCK&#x27;s assets to Rawlco, who announced plans to relaunch CKCK as an FM station. Harvard&#x27;s CKRM took over CKCK&#x27;s former AM frequency and Rawlco&#x27;s CJME took over CKRM&#x27;s former frequency.

CKCK&#x27;s old AM signal signed off the air at 11:59p.m., on November 30, 2001. The final song played on &quot;Kool&quot; was &quot;Last Song&quot; by Edward Bear.

Rawlco relaunched CKCK on 94.5 FM with test broadcasts in June 2002. It formally relaunched on August 9 with the branding &quot;Rock 94&quot;. On July 29, 2005, the station was rebranded as &quot;94.5 Jack FM&quot;, becoming the first Canadian radio station not owned by Rogers Communications to adopt that brand identity.

<doc id="720170" wikidata="Q2591461" url="?curid=720170" title="Comedian (character)">
<text>The Comedian (Edward Morgan &quot;Eddie&quot; Blake) is a fictional character who debuted in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, published by DC Comics. The Comedian was created by writer Alan Moore with artist Dave Gibbons. As with most of the main characters in the series, he was an analogue for a Charlton Comics character; in this case, the Peacemaker. Moore imagined the Comedian as a mix between the Peacemaker with &quot;a little bit of Nick Fury&quot; and &quot;probably a bit of the standard Captain America patriotic hero-type&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
The story of &quot;Watchmen&quot; starts with the aftermath of Edward Blake&#x27;s murder in 1985. Fellow crimefighter Rorschach, independently investigating the murder, discovers that Blake was in fact the Comedian. The main plot of &quot;Watchmen&quot; initially involves Rorschach&#x27;s suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes (&quot;masks&quot;); his continuing investigation into Blake&#x27;s murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Watchmen&quot; consist of flashbacks of the other characters. He is also mentioned in &quot;Under the Hood&quot;, the fictional autobiography of Hollis Mason (Nite Owl I) that appears in &quot;Watchmen&quot; issues 1–3.

The Comedian was a cigar-chomping, gun-toting vigilante-turned-paramilitary agent. When he first became a costumed adventurer in 1939, he dressed in a clown-like costume with a simple domino mask. A brutal vigilante, Blake manages to expunge most organized crime from the New York harbor. He became the youngest member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes.

After one particular photography shoot of The Minutemen, Blake attempted to rape his comrade Silk Spectre; she escaped only when another Minuteman, Hooded Justice, interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was then expelled from the group—but Silk Spectre&#x27;s entertainment agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do to the group&#x27;s image. During a secret and consensual encounter years later, Blake impregnated Silk Spectre with her daughter and successor, Laurie.

In the 1940s, Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light body armor, adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small happy face button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in World War II, becoming a war hero in the Pacific theater. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered.

By the late 1960s, Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, had published his autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; by this point and in it disclosed the Comedian&#x27;s sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebusters by Captain Metropolis, but he quickly ruined the older hero&#x27;s hopes of a new team by mocking him, and pointing out that old fashioned crime fighting methods would not save the world from nuclear war.

Alongside Doctor Manhattan, the Comedian played a major role in the United States&#x27; war with Vietnam. Shortly after Manhattan&#x27;s godlike powers forced the North Vietnamese to surrender, Blake was confronted by his lover, a pregnant Vietnamese woman. He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her, but the attack left his face permanently disfigured with a scar running from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. After this incident, he began wearing a leather gimp-style mask when dressed as the Comedian.

The costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them &quot;retired&quot; in anonymity; while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and the Comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government. Blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered, even going so far as to suggest to members of President Nixon&#x27;s staff that he had killed Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein before they could reveal the details of the Watergate scandal, as well as being behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy (on Nixon&#x27;s orders). The Iran hostage crisis in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.

It was during his return from a government mission in 1984 that Blake discovered the island where Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias) was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy New York City. Shocked and appalled by what he finds, Blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals Veidt&#x27;s plan. He drunkenly breaks into Edgar Jacobi&#x27;s house and cryptically describes the plan, knowing Jacobi will not understand but not realizing Veidt has the bedroom bugged. Veidt, to ensure that Blake does not compromise his operation, confronts Blake in his high-rise apartment and throws Blake out of the window, killing him.

===&quot;Before Watchmen&quot;===
In &quot;Before Watchmen: The Minutemen&quot; #1, additional details are revealed about the Comedian while material from the main story is somewhat retconned. It is revealed that the Comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault. Unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the Minutemen, he is shown to be driven by greed and an inherent love for violence. In particular, he assaults a bartender after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register. The issue also implies Blake may have been a victim of severe child abuse as he claims that a &quot;caseworker&quot; told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts, though Blake&#x27;s status as an unreliable narrator makes the claim uncertain.

&quot;Before Watchmen: Comedian&quot; #1 rewrites the character&#x27;s back-story further. It is revealed that Blake was friends with Robert F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy as well as Jackie Kennedy. This contradicts the main &quot;Watchmen&quot; series, which cast Edward Blake as a friend and employee of Richard Nixon. The mini-series reveals that Blake was responsible for the murder of Marilyn Monroe (ordered by Jackie Kennedy, behind her husband&#x27;s back) as well as revealing that, despite strong innuendo from both Blake and Ozymandias, that he did not kill John Kennedy and was attempting to confront Moloch when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination, including Kennedy&#x27;s death, which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief. It is implied that a former FBI agent with a resemblance to Blake may have been behind it.

===&quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;===
In the sequel comic book &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, the Comedian seemingly turns up alive when he confronts Ozymandias at the time when he was in the DC Universe meeting with Lex Luthor. It is revealed that Doctor Manhattan has captured the Comedian from moments before his death, causing him to wash ashore outside the city of Metropolis and greeting him. The Comedian continues on the trail of Mime and Marionette. He catches up to Joker, Mime, and Marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by Riddler to discuss the Superman Theory. He makes himself known by shooting Typhoon in the face. While pursuing them, he evades Giganta&#x27;s attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, the Comedian catches up to them, planning to use them to find Ozymandias. Before the Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette&#x27;s rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on the Comedian. As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with the Comedian and the Lantern Battery. Upon catching up with Ozymandias and shooting him, Luthor shoots the Comedian with a device which returns him to the moment he was taken from, leaving him to die which horrified him and feeling denied of his revenge.

== Character inspiration and origin of name==
Alan Moore has stated that the Comedian, besides his comic book inspirations, was based on G. Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent and a figure in the Watergate scandal as the chief operative of the White House Plumbers during the Nixon administration. Liddy was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping for his role in the scandal. Moore imagined the Comedian as Liddy with &quot;comic book muscles&quot;.

In the comic, Rorschach explains that Blake&#x27;s moniker of &quot;The Comedian&quot; stems from his cynical and selfish world perspective that &quot;in an insane world&quot;, one can only laugh, as if everything is &quot;a joke&quot;. Moore took the idea of the name from Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Comedians&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
The Comedian was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition, even at the time of his death at the age of 67. Blake was proficient with his M1911 .45 caliber pistol, MAC-10 submachine gun and pump-action shotgun and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures (flamethrowers, grenade launchers, etc.). His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare.

==Smiley face badge==

Throughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the &quot;smiley face&quot; button, which is closely associated with him, and has become the iconic symbol of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; series as a whole. At the beginning of the series, the button is stained with a single drop of blood which, if the button is viewed as a clock face, is at the position of the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock at the time of the series, five minutes to midnight.

<doc id="720194" wikidata="Q106520524" url="?curid=720194" title="Nite Owl">
<text>Nite Owl is the name of two superheroes in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, published by DC Comics. Created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, the original Nite Owl, Hollis T. Mason, was a member of the crimefighting team the Minutemen, while the second, Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Dreiberg, became a member of the vigilante team Crimebusters, also known as the titular Watchmen.

The duo are modified analogues of the first two Blue Beetle characters created for Fox Feature Syndicate and later sold to Charlton Comics. The second Nite Owl parodies the appearance of the iconic popular superhero Batman, while the first parodies The Phantom. The second Nite Owl received a four-part miniseries as part of the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; prequel series, and made it to number 115 on Wizard&#x27;s Top 200 Comic Book Characters list.

Both versions of Nite Owl made their first live-action appearances in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, with Dreiberg played by Patrick Wilson and Mason played by Stephen McHattie as an old man and Clint Carleton as a young man. Wilson also voices the character in the video game &quot;&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hollis T. Mason===
Hollis T. Mason was the first Nite Owl. At the age of 12, his father left the family farm in Montana and moved to New York City, working at Moe Vernon&#x27;s Auto Repairs.

Starting out as a New York City policeman in 1938, he was inspired by &quot;Action Comics&quot;&#x27; &quot;Superman&quot; and the real life exploits of Hooded Justice to take up the life of a vigilante. He was nicknamed &quot;Nite Owl&quot; for spending his evenings working out in the Police Gymnasiums as much as possible and going to bed at 9:00pm to rise for a 5:00am workout before donning his badge and uniform. His costume was designed to free his arms and legs while protecting his chest, abdomen and head with a tough leather tunic. With the tunic hiding his hair, a domino mask concealed his identity.

He became a member of the Minutemen (a &quot;masked adventurer&quot; league) in mid-1939. Mason was an &quot;old school&quot; crimefighter, a real &quot;Boy Scout&quot; in the eyes of Captain Metropolis. He stopped colorful criminals like the Screaming Skull and went on to fight supposed Axis operatives including Captain Axis during World War II. He retired in May, 1962 to open an auto business and write his memoir of his crime-fighting exploits, &quot;Under the Hood&quot;. By reading &quot;Under the Hood&quot;, Silk Spectre II later learned of the Comedian&#x27;s attempted rape of her mother Silk Spectre I.

Soon after Hollis retired, Daniel Dreiberg sought him out and asked if he could use the name and persona of Nite Owl to fight crime. Mason acceded and Dreiberg became the second Nite Owl.

After Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II broke Rorschach out of prison on Halloween night, the Knot-Tops street gang became angered by what they perceived to be vigilantism. Under the influence of the drug KT-28, the Knot-Tops believed Mason to be the same Nite Owl who participated in the prison break and decided to attack him. Mason mistook their pounding on his door for trick or treaters and opened the door to their attack. Mason put up a good fight, but the gang leader killed Mason by hitting him with the very statue of himself that was given to him by the city as an acknowledgment and reward for his service as a costumed adventurer. Dreiberg learned about Hollis&#x27;s murder and vowed revenge on the gang. As Nite Owl, he beat up one of the Knot-Tops and threatened to kill him and the whole gang before Rorschach drew him away to continue the more important mission they were on. The entire gang eventually died at the hands of Ozymandias&#x27; monster.

After being forced to change their identities to avoid government persecution, Dan and Laurie changed their names to Sam and Sandra; they used the married surname &quot;Hollis&quot; in tribute to Hollis Mason.

===Daniel Dreiberg===

Born on September 18, 1940, Daniel Dreiberg, a Blue Beetle-like figure, relied on both technical wizardry and tools as well as his skills as a fighter, which set him apart from his fellow costumed adventurers. All of his gadgets and costumes are based on an owl theme. He uses an owl-shaped flying vehicle nicknamed the &quot;Owlship&quot; or &quot;Archie&quot; (short for Archimedes, after Merlin&#x27;s pet owl in T.H. White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;), equipped with a variety of and defensive devices, such as flamethrowers and &quot;screechers&quot;—devices capable of producing a sharp screech-like sound.

Dreiberg (as Nite Owl) met fellow costumed adventurer Rorschach, who suggested they partner to take on organized crime. The two became, not only a team, but also best friends. He supported the idea of costumed vigilantes forming a group to fight crime strategically, but Rorschach and the Comedian rejected the idea. Having already come to understand that his expensive activities were too limited in scope to make any real difference, Dreiberg retired after the passing of the Keene Act on August 3, 1977. In 1985 (when the story takes place) he seemed to regret his decision to give up crime fighting, having no sense of personal fulfillment without it. Rorschach said regarding his retirement, &quot;&quot;No staying power&quot;. Following the Keene Act, Dreiberg contributed scholarly articles to ornithological journals.

====Events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;====
Dreiberg became romantically entangled with the second Silk Spectre, Laurie Juspeczyk, after she left Doctor Manhattan. He returned to vigilantism along with her following the murder of the Comedian. Their first foray was the successful rescue of the occupants of a burning building. The excitement of aiding the residents awakened Dreiberg&#x27;s sexual feelings for Laurie and the two made passionate love following the rescue. They later broke Rorschach out of prison in an attempt to stop Ozymandias&#x27; scheme to &quot;save the world from itself.&quot;&quot; Unfortunately, the freeing of Rorschach indirectly resulted in the brutal murder of Hollis Mason, which Dan learned of only when he and Rorschach interrogated suspects. Upon learning of Mason&#x27;s death, Dreiberg became violent, attacking the informer and loudly swearing vengeance against Mason&#x27;s killers with such ferocity that Rorschach had to restrain him. In the end, Hollis&#x27; killers (the Knot-Tops) were killed along with half of New York City by Ozymandias&#x27; plot.

Dan and Rorschach traveled to Ozymandias&#x27; Antarctic fortress. They battled with and were swiftly defeated by Ozymandias, who revealed his plan to unleash a telepathic monstrosity on New York City that will release massive psychic waves that will kill half the city. Nite Owl expressed the desire to stop him and was told that it already happened. Millions were dead, and the world&#x27;s nations agreed to work together to combat this new &quot;extraterrestrial threat&quot;. Reluctantly, Dan and the recently arrived Dr. Manhattan and Laurie Juspeczyk agreed to keep this secret for the sake of world peace.

The morally absolute Rorschach left, attempting to take Dan&#x27;s vehicle back to civilization to tell the world. Unseen by the others, Doctor Manhattan killed Rorschach to stop him. Dan and Laurie were offered hospitality by Ozymandias, which they accepted. Before leaving for another galaxy, Manhattan seemed satisfied and happy at the sight of Laurie now in a relationship with Dan.

In the conclusion of the story, having been assumed to be dead in the attack, they were seen in their new identities of Sam and Sandra Hollis (in homage to the late Mason), with dyed blonde hair. They traveled to California and made a brief visit to Laurie&#x27;s mother Sally Jupiter, the former Silk Spectre, in which Laurie reconciles with her mother over the discovery that the Comedian was her father. They promised to visit again soon and left with the intent of continuing their adventures in crime-fighting.

====Events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;====

It is revealed that seven years after the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Sam and Sandra Hollis&quot; have a daughter together. They also adopt Clark, the son of two costumed villains, Mime and Marionette. After jailing the pair following an aborted bank robbery, Dr. Manhattan noted that Marionette was pregnant. He sensed that the child had a bright future ahead of him. To preserve that future, he took the boy as an infant following his birth in a prison hospital. Dr. Manhattan named him Clark, raised him nearly to his teen years and after bequeathing Clark his powers and infusing his life force into the planet, brought Clark to the Hollises to raise.

==Other versions==
===Kingdom Come===
* &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, set on Earth-22, features Hollis Mason&#x27;s book &quot;Under the Hood&quot; on display in a store. 

==Feature film and script versions==
In the 1989 Sam Hamm film draft script and the 2003 David Hayter film draft script, the superhero name is Night Owl. Further, the characters that adopted the Nite Owl persona are combined into one character, and there is no showing or mention of Hollis Mason as the first Nite Owl. In the climax of the 2003 script Dreiberg kills Veidt after sleeping with Laurie while in Antarctica. In addition, Dreiberg and Laurie have a child at the end of the story.

==In other media==
===Film===

Both Nite Owl incarnations appear in &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Patrick Wilson portrays the second Nite Owl, Dan Dreiberg, and Stephen McHattie portrays the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason. Mason&#x27;s murder at the hands of the gang is not featured in the theatrical version, although the director’s cut shows his death. Clint Carleton portrayed the younger Hollis Mason in flashbacks.

Both Nite Owl incarnations appear in the 2024 two-part animated film, &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Matthew Rhys voices the second Nite Owl, Dan Dreiberg and Geoff Pierson voices the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason.

===Television===
* Both Nite Owl incarnations appears in &quot;&quot;, where they, along with every other character in the series, are voiced by Tom Stechschulte.
* Nite Owl II makes non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;.
* Although he does not appear in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, supplementary materials reveal that Dan and Silk Spectre II ended their relationship in the 1990s, as he desired children while she wished to keep fighting crime. They were later arrested in 1995 by the FBI for violating the Keene Act after foiling the Oklahoma City bombing. While Laurie subsequently became a member of the FBI, Dan is still in federal custody. This was confirmed in the episode &quot;She Was Killed by Space Junk&quot;, where Senator Joe Keene Jr. notices that Laurie Blake has a pet owl and he states that he can arrange for Dan to be pardoned if he becomes President of the United States. The supplementary materials also reveal that Dan had sent a mocking gift for Laurie in the form of &quot;Excalibur&quot;, a vibrator modelled after Doctor Manhattan designed by Dan, in addition to expanding his enterprise by distributing Owlships to various law enforcement agencies through MerlinCorp, a company secretly owned by him.

===Video games===
Nite Owl II appears as a playable character in &quot;&quot;, with Patrick Wilson reprising his role from the film.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot;, infant versions of Nite Owl II along with Ozymandias, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach are shown riding a surfboard on the cover of a DVD of the fictional film &quot;Watchmen Babies in V for Vacation&quot; (a parody of Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novels &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;).

<text>A lord provost () is the convenor of the local authority, the civic head and the lord-lieutenant of one of the principal cities of Scotland. The office is similar to that of a lord mayor. Only the cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Stirling and Glasgow have a lord provost; other Scottish local authorities have provosts or convenors, which are similar offices to that of a mayor (as a presiding officer of the local council, not as a chief executive of a local authority). Perth (as a city) previously termed its civil leader a &quot;lord provost&quot;, but from the Second World War onwards has preferred the simple term Provost of Perth.

A lord provost has a higher status than a lord mayor in other parts of the United Kingdom. They are ex officio the lord-lieutenant for that city, in accordance with section 1 of the Lieutenancies Act 1997, which allows the city council to choose its own representative for the monarch.

The lord provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow enjoy the style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; before their office, but not their names.

Permission to use the title is granted to a city by the monarch, under the royal prerogative, acting on the advice of government ministers.

<doc id="720221" wikidata="Q1002872" url="?curid=720221" title="Buick Regal">
<text>The Buick Regal is a line of mid-size cars marketed by Buick since 1973. For nearly its entire production, the Regal has served as the premium mid-size/intermediate offering of the Buick product range. Introduced as a submodel of the Buick Century, the model line is currently in its sixth generation. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the Regal served as the Buick counterpart of the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.

Originally introduced as a personal luxury coupe, the Regal was later expanded to a full model line. To showcase its success in NASCAR racing, from 1982 to 1987, Buick introduced the Buick Regal Grand National, Regal T-Type, and the limited-production Buick GNX. During the 1990s, while the four-door sedan superseded the two-door coupe entirely, forced-induction engines made their return, with superchargers replacing turbochargers.

For 1999, the Buick Regal inaugurated the sale of GM vehicles in the Chinese market, with the 1997 design lasting through 2008. Following the 2004 model year, Buick retired the nameplate in North America, with the Regal replaced by the Buick LaCrosse.

For 2008, Opel introduced the Opel Insignia as its largest sedan, with Buick rebranding the model line as the Regal for the Chinese market. For 2011, GM reintroduced the Regal to North America, rebranding the Insignia sedan for North America. For 2018, Buick introduced the second-generation Opel Insignia, sourcing all production from Germany; alongside a first-ever liftback sedan, the Regal TourX was the first Buick station wagon in 22 years.

After 2020, as the division shifted away from car model lines, Buick ended sales of the Regal in North America.


== First generation (1973) ==
Buick had been the first GM division to bring a personal luxury car to market with its 1963 Riviera, but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which Pontiac created with the 1969 Grand Prix and Chevrolet with the Monte Carlo the following year, 1970. At the same time, Oldsmobile added a formal notchback coupé to its intermediate line, the Cutlass Supreme, in 1970 and that model soon became Olds&#x27; best-selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called &quot;Colonnade&quot; cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick&#x27;s intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.

A highly trimmed, two-door coupe, the first Regal, officially marketed as the &quot;Century Regal Colonnade Hardtop coupe&quot;, shared its front and rear styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and taillight lenses. The Regal shared the same &quot;Colonnade&quot; pillared hardtop roofline (a hardtop with B-pillars (center pillars) but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme as well as the lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.

For the first model year in 1973, the Regal nameplate was only used for Buick&#x27;s version of the GM intermediate personal luxury coupe, but the following year gained a sedan companion (there was no Regal station wagon).

The Century moniker was discontinued for 1976, with the model now marketed as the Buick Regal.

Interiors were generally more luxurious than lesser Century models, as the Regal featured woodgrain trim on dashboard and door panels, as well as door-pull straps and bench seats with center armrests upholstered in cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optional throughout the run was a 60/40 split-bench seat with armrest. For 1976 and 1977, the available Regal S/R coupe included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.

The model lasted five years with minimal changes, although there was a fairly substantial facelift for the coupe for 1976. The sedan retained its original 1973 sheetmetal through 1977. 1976 models incorporated the recently legalized rectangular headlights, mounted horizontally on the coupe and vertically on the sedan. The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme, which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976. The listed retail price for a 1976 Regal was $4,910 ($ in dollars ).

The Regal was most commonly powered by Buick&#x27;s V8, which was standard equipment on all models for 1973 and 1974 before being made optional on coupes from 1975 to 1977, and the larger V8 that was optional for 1973 and 1974 models only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick&#x27;s resurrected V6 engine previously offered on the 1964–1967 Skylark; the engine&#x27;s tooling had been sold to Kaiser Motors for use in Jeep models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. For 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The bolt pattern for this vehicle is 5×.

== Second generation (1978) ==
A downsized Regal appeared for the 1978 model year with Buick&#x27;s new V6 engine as standard equipment and a revised version of the venerable V6 as an option (which became standard for 1980). Initially, a three-speed manual transmission was standard but this was later replaced by an automatic. At the time of introduction, Regals were available exclusively as coupés with the Century nameplate applied to standard equipment sedans and station wagons. In January 1982 the Century was replaced by an all-new car on the front-wheel drive A platform, which meant that the Regal gained a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon - essentially facelifted and rebadged versions of the previous year&#x27;s rear-wheel drive Century. It was the first time the name appeared on a full model lineup. The wagon was discontinued after 1983, and the sedan dropped from the lineup the next year. This generation Regal lasted ten years. The base model was equipped with softer-riding luxury suspension, and did not offer a manual transmission in later years.

The 1978 Regal could be equipped with a Turbocharged V6 engine with automatic transmission, and was known as a Regal Sport Coupe. The Buick LeSabre was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Saab. The Regal Sport Coupe also included a firm handling suspension with larger tires and sport wheels. Bucket seats and a center console with a T-shifter were also available.

For 1980, the Regal was offered in a special Somerset Limited Edition trim which featured unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, wire wheel covers, sport mirrors, and chrome Somerset badging. The interior had tan and blue plush velour upholstery, brushed chrome trim, and additional Somerset badging. A Somerset Limited Edition model was also offered on the restyled 1981 Regal. It had unique dark sandstone and camel exterior paint, sport mirrors, and turbine wheels. The interior&#x27;s plush velour upholstery was camel with dark brown piping.

A major facelift for 1981 gave the Regal a much more aerodynamic profile, helping make it possible for the car to compete on the NASCAR racing circuit. The sloping hood and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams, and reduced the drag coefficient by eighteen percent. Richard Petty drove one to victory in the 1981 Daytona 500, and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982. Buick would remain the last marque other than Chevrolet or Ford to win the Cup Series manufacturers championship until Toyota scored its first in 2016.

V8s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to (1980 and 1981 only, Pontiac built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. From 1986 to 1987, the V8 was available as an option. The 2-bbl V6 was standard. The 200-4R overdrive transmission was an option with either engine.

=== Grand National, Turbo-T and T-Type ===

In 1978, the first turbocharged Regal was introduced as the Regal Sport Coupe. Turbo versions were originally offered with either a two- or a four-barrel carburetor and , but the two-barrel option was removed for 1979. Meanwhile, the four-barrel&#x27;s maximum output increased to . Power remained unchanged until 1982, when it increased to and then in 1983, when the Sport Coupe was replaced by the Regal T-Type.

In February 1982, the Grand National debuted, which was named for the NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series (the &quot;Grand National&quot; term was part of the Cup series nomenclature until 1986). Buick had won the Manufacturers Cup in 1981 and 1982, and wanted to capitalize on its success: &quot;What wins on Sunday, sells on Monday&quot;, and hoping to revive their performance image from the 1960s with the Buick Skylark Gran Sport. These 1982 cars were not painted black. All examples started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to a subcontractor for finishing.

Originally intended for a run of 100 units, Cars and Concepts of Brighton, Michigan, retrofitted 215 Regals with the GN package. Most obvious was the light silver-gray firemist paint added to each side. Red pinstripes and billboard shadow lettering proclaiming &quot;Buick&quot; were applied. The wheel opening moldings and rocker panel moldings were blacked out using black vinyl tape. Finally, a front air dam and rear spoiler were installed. On the inside, special &quot;Lear-Siegler&quot; seats were installed. These seats are fully adjustable and were covered with silver brandon cloth with black vinyl inserts. The front seat had Buick&#x27;s &quot;6&quot; emblem embroidered onto them. Also, a special clock delete plate was added to the instrument panel which contained the yellow and orange &quot;6&quot; logo and the words &quot;Grand National Buick Motor Division&quot;.)
The 1982 GN came with a naturally aspirated V6 engine with at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. Of the 215 Grand Nationals produced in 1982, at least 35 were based on the Buick Regal Sport Coupe package with the turbocharged V6 engine with at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2600 rpm. There were only 2022 Sport coupes produced in 1982, and the number of cars with both the GN and Sport coupe packages is estimated to be fewer than 50.

For 1983, there was no Grand National. The Sport Coupe model was renamed the T-Type; 3,732 were produced ( at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm). The power gains came courtesy of a low-restriction dual exhaust, stainless steel headers (rather than the original cast iron items), and other detail improvements. Drivability was improved thanks to better electronics for the exhaust gas recirculation system as well as the knock sensor. The T-Type trim name had been used on other Buicks, starting with the Riviera in 1981 (in 1979 and 1980, it was the S-Type). Other improvements on the 1983 Regal T-Type included Hydro-Boost II brakes, 200-4R four-speed overdrive transmission replacing the earlier three-speed, and a 3.42 rear axle (7.5&quot;). Inside there were new bucket seats and a sport steering wheel and quicker steering ratio, while the suspension was honed with a larger diameter anti-roll bar, altered spring rates, and re-valved shock absorbers.

For 1984, the Grand National returned, now in all black paint. The turbocharged became standard and was refined with sequential fuel injection, distributor-less computer-controlled ignition, and boasted at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm. Only 5,204 turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2,000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year of production of the computer-controlled sequential fuel injection and distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year and model that started the development of the legendary intercooled Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the &quot;little V6&quot; easily kept up with the bigger V8s.  performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of , while for the same year, the Chevrolet Camaro V6 was listed at 17.0 and the Chevrolet Corvette at 15.2 seconds. 

For 1985, the Grand National remained unchanged.

For 1986, a modified engine design with air-air intercooling boosted the performance even further to a specified at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm. The Grand Nationals (quantity 5,512) and T-Types (quantity 2,384) were both produced in 1986. For 1987, performance increased 10 hp, to and of torque, however no design revisions were applied to the engine and systems. Buick dropped the T-Type package for Regal for 1987 models and opted for a &quot;T&quot; sport package instead. There were only 7,896 turbo Regals produced in 1986. In 1987, when turbo Regals reached their peak in popularity, a total of 27,590 turbo Regals were produced through December, with those models produced between September and December of that year window stickered as &quot;1987½ Buick Grand National&quot; vehicles.

For 1987, a lightweight WE4 option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced. The differences between a WE4 and the Grand National were the interior trim package, wheels, exterior badging, aluminum bumper supports, and aluminum rear drum brakes as opposed to the Grand National&#x27;s cast iron, making the WE4 a lighter and faster car. The rear spoiler was only available as a dealer-installed option. 1987 was the only year that the LC2 turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to have a Limited with a vinyl landau roof and a power bulge turbo hood. Turbo Regal Limiteds were one of the rarest models of turbo Regals produced second only to the GNX at 1,035 turbo Limiteds. Turbo Regal Limiteds could be ordered with many options with most having chrome external trim but for $35 could have been built with the full black-out trim WO2 option making them extremely rare (similarly, a base Regal could also be ordered with the Turbo 6, and, the WO2 blackout trim was also available; all rare). Limiteds were treated to a very luxurious interior with plush carpeting and optional bench pillow seats and a column shift. It was also possible to order the 1987 Regal T with the 5.0/307 V8 instead of the turbo 3.8/231 V6. The 1987 model would be the end of the manufacture of the RWD &quot;G-Body&quot; Regal, but GM had to extend the build of the Grand National to meet customer demand into December.

===GNX===
For the final year, 1987, Buick introduced the limited production GNX, for &quot;Grand National Experimental&quot;, at $29,900 ($ adjusted for inflation in ). Made in partnership with McLaren Performance Technologies/ASC, Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then sent off to McLaren and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at at 4400 rpm and a very substantial at 3000 rpm of torque, although actual output is and . This was created to be the &quot;Grand National to end all Grand Nationals&quot;.

Changes made included a special Garrett AiResearch T-3 turbocharger with a ceramic-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity intercooler with a &quot;Cermatel (ceramic-aluminum) coated&quot; pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual mufflers, reprogrammed turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom torque converter and transmission cooler, and unique differential cover/Panhard bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front fender, 16 inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing Stewart-Warner analog gauges, including an analog turbo boost gauge. The GNX used a unique torque arm that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased traction. The torque arm rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction. GNX #001 is the 1986 prototype currently owned by Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US.

Dragstrip performance was measured as faster than the Ferrari F40 and the Porsche 930 with a time of 12.7 seconds at (0.3 and 0.8 seconds quicker, 2.9 and faster) and a 0- time of 4.6 seconds (0.4 and 0.3 seconds quicker, respectively).

The stealthy appearance of the all-black GNX and Grand National (and the resemblance of its grill to his helmet&#x27;s mouthpiece), coupled with the fact that the Grand National was initially released during the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, earned it the title &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s Car.” Due to the turbocharged six-cylinder engine, the Buick make, and the black paint Grand Nationals were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dark Side&quot;. The &quot;Dark Side&quot; contrasted with the more common V8 Mustangs and Camaros that were popular at the time.

&quot;GNX&quot; is the title for hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s 2024 album and its eponymous 11th track, and the car is on the album&#x27;s cover art.

== Third generation (1988) ==
A new Regal appeared in October 1987 on the GM W platform as the first vehicle on that platform; this generation ran with few changes for nine years. Though the new Regal returned to Buick&#x27;s original concept in being offered only as a coupe and in being aimed once again squarely at the personal luxury buyer, it departed from tradition in being the first front-wheel-drive model, and in having no serious performance option or edition. Neither a V8 engine nor a turbocharged V6 was offered; the only engine available for 1988 was the Chevrolet 2.8 L V6, producing . From mid-1990, owing to the declining personal luxury car market, a four-door sedan version of the Regal was re-introduced (simultaneously as the Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix, the latter offered as a sedan for the first time). However, sales of the new sedan were delayed until the 1991 model year. The four-door version was intended as a replacement for the A-body based Century, however, the popularity of that model meant that it would remain in production as a lower priced alternative to the Regal until both cars were redesigned for 1997. This generation saw the installation of Dynaride, which was an air compressor that would pressurize the rear Chapman Struts to maintain a level overall ride height. A badge was installed on the dashboard to the left of the steering column on all vehicles equipped. It was not available on vehicles equipped with Gran Touring Suspension, which instead used a stiffer setup with traditional hydraulic rear struts.

=== Annual changes ===
The Regal was initially offered in base &quot;Custom&quot; and upscale &quot;Limited&quot; trim lines. For 1989, the &quot;Gran Sport&quot; trim line was added, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console-mounted shifter attached to the 4-speed automatic. In mid-1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8 L V6 with &quot;Tuned-Port-Injection&quot; (TPI). The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal amongst the W-body cars, differentiating it from the mechanically similar Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Pontiac Grand Prix. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base &quot;Custom&quot; cars from 1992.

For 1993, the Regal sedan received a minor facelift with a new hood and larger grille more reminiscent of the larger Buick models, as well as larger taillights. Along with this change came the introduction of an all new electronically controlled 4T60-E automatic transmission to replace the previous 4T60. For 1994, a driver&#x27;s-side airbag was added, along with standard ABS on all models, standard power windows, and more in the base engine due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder head. The &quot;Limited&quot; coupe was deleted; only the &quot;Custom&quot; and &quot;Gran Sport (GS)&quot; coupes remained. 

For 1995, another facelift occurred with new smoothed out bumpers, taillights, and body cladding. The interior was completely redesigned to be more streamlined and ergonomically friendly with dual front airbags now standard. For 1996, the larger V6 engine became the &quot;3800 Series II&quot; and bumped power to and . All models were now modified to be OBD II compliant. A special &quot;Olympic Gold&quot; edition (also available on Skylark) was added to celebrate Buick&#x27;s partnership with the 1996 Summer Olympics, complete with gold accents and traditional Olympic logos on the exterior and interior.

== Fourth generation (1997) ==

For the 1997 model year, the Century and Regal once again rode upon the same platform; the revised W platform that was shared with the Oldsmobile Intrigue, the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The Regal coupe was discontinued.

Differences between the Regal and Century were mostly cosmetic. As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8 L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a Monsoon 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version&#x27;s seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the A platform) which had standard 6-passenger seating.

This period held the fastest Buick since the days of the 1987 GNX: the Buick Regal GS. This car was now supercharged instead of turbocharged, and produced and of torque. When introduced in January 1997, Buick advertised the Regal GS as &quot;The official car of the supercharged family&quot;. Buick also released two other model types, the LSE and the GSE. The LSE stayed with the engine with upgrades and the GSE stayed with the supercharged engine with upgrades. Also, in 2000 Buick came out with a concept GSX that had an intercooled 3.8 L, but was supercharged rather than turbocharged. It had .

From 2001 to 2004 Buick offered a Joseph Abboud appearance package on both the GS and LS models. This package included either a solid taupe or two-tone taupe/chestnut leather seats, two-tone leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather shifter handle and boot, 16-inch aluminum wheels; and Joseph Abboud signature emblems on the front doors, floor mats, front-seat headrests, and taillights.

The North American Regal was replaced in 2005 by the Buick LaCrosse, also built on the W platform. The final 2004 Buick Regal rolled off the assembly line on June 1, 2004.

=== Engines ===
* 1997–2004 3.8 L L36 Series II V6
* 1997–2004 3.8 L L67 Series II supercharged V6

The Regal LS from the factory had a 1/4 mile (≈400 m) elapsed time (ET) of 15.8 seconds and could do 0-60 mph in under 8 seconds. The supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to took 6.7 seconds. The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced &amp; of torque. The Regal GS&#x27;s PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. The Regal LS was EPA rated at 19/30 MPG city/freeway while the supercharged Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.

=== Regal LSX and GSX (SLP Performance) ===
In the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick officially offered — in collaboration with Troy, Michigan based tuners, Street Legal Performance, aka SLP Performance — the Buick Regal GSX, with dealer-supplied and installed options for both LS and GS models. The SLP GSX offered three packages, marketed as &quot;stages&quot;. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. The Stage 2 package added a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components — good for an extra 20 horsepower. The Stage 3 package added a 3.5-inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to increase the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at and of torque. 

As GSX parts remained directly available from SLP for many years, Regal GS sedan owners could have their cars independently customized to GSX appearance and performance by SLP dealers, including for Regal GS models from 1997 to 2004. An authentic Buick GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.

=== China ===
General Motors and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) established a joint venture in 1997 called Shanghai GM, and had begun assembling the Buick Regal in Shanghai, China in April 1999.

The Regal has sold well in the Chinese market as a large, relatively luxurious model, despite its high price, costing more than the North American version. The Chinese market Regal has different front- and rear-end styling compared to the North American version and different engines, including the 2.0 L &quot;L34&quot;, the 2.5 L &quot;LB8&quot; V6 and the 3.0 L &quot;LW9&quot; V6. Gearbox choices were a 4-speed automatic for V6 models, while four-cylinder variants are paired with an exclusive 5-speed manual gearbox. V6 models had a set of black dashboard gauges, while the four-cylinder models had white dashboard gauges. These models also had slightly different names: the entry-level model was the &quot;New Century&quot;, with more upscale models carrying the &quot;GL&quot; and &quot;GLX&quot; names. Later, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;GS&quot; models were added. Production for this generation ended in November 2008 in China being replaced by the Opel Insignia-based Regal.

The Chinese-built Regal was also sold in the Philippines from 2005 to 2006 as the Chevrolet Lumina, where it replaced the Opel Vectra. The 2.5 V6 was the only engine option. The Chevrolet Lumina was discontinued from the Filipino market in 2006, leaving GM again without a mid-size sedan until the introduction of the eighth generation Chevrolet Malibu in 2013.
== Fifth generation (2008) ==


The fifth-generation Buick Regal is a four-door, five-passenger, midsized sedan with a front engine, front-wheel drive layout. According to GM published information, more than 41 percent of Regal buyers in the US came from non-General Motors brands, and more than 60 percent of CXL Turbo buyers were under the age of 55.

=== Development ===
The fifth generation Buick Regal rides on GM&#x27;s Epsilon II platform and is mostly identical to the Opel Insignia. It first went into production in Rüsselsheim, Germany, in 2008. The Shanghai GM twin of the Insignia was introduced in China as Buick Regal in December, 2008 for the 2009 model year.

GM originally planned to sell a modified version of the Opel Insignia in North America as the second generation Saturn Aura, but changed strategy after deciding to discontinue the Saturn brand. The Regal utilizes unibody construction with galvanized steel front fenders, hood, roof and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) bumper covers. The North American Regal weighs about more than an equivalent Opel Insignia due to increased structural support in the B-pillar necessary to meet U.S. rollover standards.

Buick&#x27;s product manager director Roger McCormack stated in a 2010 consumer webchat that a coupé version was under heavy consideration, as well as the possibility for further body styles such as a convertible. A Buick-badged Insignia Sports Tourer was also spied, but the following year a Buick spokesperson declared that there were no plans to sell a Regal wagon.

=== Marketing ===
GM presented the fifth-generation Regal to North American dealers on October 14, 2009, and introduced the Regal to the public in November 2009 at the LA Auto Show. Sales of the Regal began in February 2010. In North America, the Regal is positioned below the larger, more expensive LaCrosse and above the Verano compact sedan which debuted late in the 2011 calendar year.

=== Production ===
Production of the Shanghai GM variant of the Regal began in November 2008 and ended in July 2017. North American production at General Motors of Canada&#x27;s Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant was confirmed on November 25, 2009, and production began at Oshawa Car Assembly in February 2011. The initial production for the North American market was done together with its Opel twin the Opel Insignia in the Adam Opel AG&#x27;s Rüsselsheim, Germany assembly plant from March 1, 2010, to March 25, 2011 (33,669 cars in 2010 and 12,637 in 2011).

=== Trim levels ===
==== CXL ====
The Regal debuted in North America with a 2.4L DOHC I4 engine rated at and of torque — using a Hydra-Matic 6T45 six-speed

The 2011 Regal manufactured in North America was offered in a single trim level, marketed as CXL, offered with two engine choices and seven option packages. Buick had planned to offer a lower-level trim called CX with cloth seats and a higher level trim called CXS, but those trim levels were not offered.

==== CXL Turbo ====
The CXL Turbo comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0L direct-injected Ecotec DOHC I4 rated at and of torque, mated to either an Aisin AF40 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, making the Regal Turbo the first Buick model to be offered with a manual transmission since the Buick Skyhawk ended production in 1989. The 2.0L turbo is the first direct-injected turbocharged production car capable of running on any blend of gasoline or E85 ethanol.

==== GS ====

At the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, GM showed a concept GS version of the Regal based on the Opel Insignia OPC and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. The concept featured a 2.0L, , high-output DOHC I4 turbocharged Ecotec engine, a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive.

The production GS left most of the concept specifications intact, but is front-wheel drive. The GS features Buick&#x27;s Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with Brembo front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19 inch wheels were offered standard, with 20 inch forged aluminum wheels available as an option. The production version is equipped with GS-only high-output version of the Ecotec 2.0L turbo engine with at 5300 rpm and of torque at 2400 rpm. The GM LHU engine used in the GS trim makes 135 hp per liter - Buick&#x27;s highest specific output ever. The GS has a quoted 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) time of 6.7 seconds (Motor Trend achieved 6.3 seconds) and a quarter mile time of 14.9 seconds. The GS went on sale in fall 2011 as a 2012 model.

Shanghai GM&#x27;s locally produced variant of the Regal GS went on sale in China on September 15, 2011. The output of the 2.0L Turbo SIDI engine is , which is about less than the production US-model. The torque is . and the top speed is claimed as . The car is only offered in this case as a front-wheel-drive. There exist also some interior and exterior differences between the American and Chinese models.

==== Sport Touring Edition ====
For 2016, the Regal added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18-inch aluminum black pocket wheels and a rear lip spoiler. This remained in the lineup for this generation&#x27;s final model year.

==== eAssist ====

Beginning in 2011, Buick began offering the eAssist system in the Regal, The 2012 model year Regal is the second GM vehicle to offer eAssist after the 2012 Buick LaCrosse. The eAssist system is standard in the LaCrosse 2.5 L I4, but the eAssist powertrain is optional in the Regal.

The eAssist system adds a lithium-ion battery housed in the trunk, along with regenerative braking, engine stop/start, fuel cut-off, grille louvres that close at speed, underbody panels and low-rolling resistance tires. The eAssist system adds up to to the standard 2.4L Ecotec engine during acceleration. Fuel economy for the Regal with eAssist is estimated at city, highway.

=== 2014 update ===

GM presented an updated 2014 Regal at the 2013 New York Auto Show. Changes included a revised interior and exterior, an increase to 258 hp (192 kW) and 295 lb·ft (400 N·m) of torque for the CXL Turbo and an available all-wheel drive option for the 2.0L engine/6-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. Changes for the GS included revised interior and exterior, a drop in power to match that of the CXL Turbo, and available an all-wheel-drive option offered for the 2.0L / six-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. The six-speed manual transmission was offered in the front-wheel-drive variant. Buick&#x27;s VentiPorts reappeared starting with 2014 models, a styling feature first used by Buick in 1949.


For model year 2014, safety features included forward collision warning, lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a following-distance indicator. The foregoing are all part of a Driver Confidence package, while collision preparation, which pre-loads the brake system ahead of an imminent collision, and adaptive cruise control are available separately.

== Sixth generation (2018) ==

On April 4, 2017, GM presented the sixth-generation 2018 Buick Regal at the GM Design Dome in Warren, Michigan; sales of the model line began in China on July 21, 2017. As with the Buick Cascada, the Regal became a captive import, as Buick sourced production of the model line entirely from Opel in Rüsselsheim. 

Introduced as a divisional counterpart of the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia B, the Regal moved to the E2XX (third-generation Epsilon) platform; though most closely related to the final-generation Chevrolet Malibu, it uses a longer wheelbase than the Chevrolet Impala. Alongside the Insignia, the Regal was also marketed alongside the Holden ZB Commodore (the final version of the Commodore line). 

===Regal Sportback===
Replacing the previous Regal four-door sedan, the Regal Sportback is a 5-door liftback sedan; the hatchback was incorporated within a fastback roofline, allowing for additional cargo room and flexibility. Though nominally larger in size over the previous 4-door, the Sportback weighed less than the previous-generation Regal sedan. Buick offered three standard trims: 1SV (base), Preferred, and Essence, along with the flagship Avenir trim. The Regal GS (see below) was only offered with the Sportback body. 

Offered with either front or all-wheel drive, the Sportback used only the 250hp &quot;LTG&quot; 2.0L turbocharged I4 engine ( for front-wheel drive; for all-wheel drive). An 8-speed automatic was fitted to all-wheel drive vehicles, while a 9-speed automatic was fitted to front-wheel drive powertrains. 

===Regal TourX===
The Regal TourX is a 5-door station wagon, serving as a counterpart of the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia Country Tourer and the Holden Commodore ZB Calais Tourer, a rugged-style station wagon with plastic body cladding, slightly raised suspension, and standard all-wheel drive. The Country Tourer was a body style introduced by the previous-generation Insignia A, but was not imported by GM. 

Sized between the Subaru Outback and the Volvo V90 station wagons, the TourX was not marketed as an off-road vehicle, but as a sportier touring vehicle. The TourX was offered with three trims: 1SV (base), Preferred, and Essence (the Avenir and GS were not offered). 

The first station wagon in the Regal line in 35 years, the 2018 TourX was the first Buick station wagon of any kind since the division retired the Roadmaster and Century Estates after 1996. One of the largest station wagons sold in North America, the TourX held 73.5 cubic feet of cargo space (matching the Outback), the most of any Buick (with the exception of the three-row Buick Enclave).

The TourX was offered with one powertrain: a 2.0-liter &quot;LTG&quot; turbocharged I4, with a and output, paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission.


===Regal GS===
The Regal GS (Grand Sport) is the highest-performance version of the Buick Regal, using the body of the Regal Sportback. The counterpart of the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia GSi (replacing the previous OPC) and the Holden Commodore VXR, the Regal GS featured a higher-performance powertrain, standard all-wheel drive, and upgraded suspension. The exterior was styled with its own grille, front and rear bumpers, 19-inch wheels, and an integrated decklid spoiler. The interior is fitted with its own front seats, and a digital instrument cluster, and GS-specific trim. 

The E2XX Regal GS is the most powerful Buick Regal ever produced (eclipsing the official rated output of the 1987 Buick GNX), powered by a 3.6 liter LGX V6, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. 
=== Regal (China) ===
For China, the Regal made its return for 2018, with SAIC-GM locally producing the Opel Insignia B. In contrast to its American namesake, the SAIC-produced Regal was designed as a four-door sedan with a traditional decklid; no Sportback 5-door nor TourX wagon has been sold in China (the four-door was also never sold as an Insignia nor as a Commodore). As before, the Regal has been slotted between the Verano and LaCrosse sedans. The Chinese-market Regal (sold in front-wheel drive only) was initially sold in four trims: 20T (1.5L turbo I4), 28T (2.0L turbo I4), GS (2.0L turbo I4), and 30H hybrid (1.6L I4 + EV motors). Turbocharged Regals were fitted with a 9-speed automatic transmissions while the hybrid was fitted with a CVT. 

SAIC-GM Regals were visually similar to Opel-assembled units, with non-GS vehicles closest in design to Essence-trim Sportbacks (though using the digital instrument panel of the GS). For 2021, the Regal underwent a model update, receiving a restyled grille and updated dashboard and center console (with a pushbutton gear selector). For 2022, the trim levels were reduced to Luxury and GS. For 2024, a second facelift, concentrating primarily on the front fascia, brought the Regal in line with the Buick &quot;Pure Design&quot; style (seen on Buick American SUVs), giving the model a revised Buick tri-shield emblem. 

===Discontinuation===
In December 2019, General Motors announced that it would stop importing the Buick Regal for North America after the 2020 model year. Following the 2020 withdrawal of the Cascada and LaCrosse, Buick ended its 113-year run of manufacturing and marketing cars, that is sedans and sedan derivatives, in North America — in favor of sport utility vehicles (SUVs).

Alongside shifting consumer tastes, the discontinuation of the Regal in North America was also influenced by the sale of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA Group. While the latter did not operate in North America in 2017, at the end of 2019, PSA Group acquired FCA, which created Stellantis (the current parent company of Chrysler in North America).

In China, SAIC-GM continues to produce the Opel-designed Regal sedan, slotted between the Verano and LaCrosse sedans; the standard Regal and Regal GS underwent a model update for 2021.

<text>Silk Spectre is the name of two fictional superheroines in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, published by DC Comics. Created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, the original Silk Spectre, Sally &quot;Jupiter&quot; Juspeczyk, was a member of the crimefighting team the Minutemen, while the second, Sally&#x27;s daughter Laurel &quot;Laurie&quot; Jane Juspeczyk, became a member of the vigilante team Crimebusters, also known as the titular Watchmen.

In the early stages of the series&#x27; development, the characters were Charlton Comics superheroes; the female superhero was supposed to be Nightshade. However, Moore did not find Nightshade particularly interesting and was not even very familiar with the character. After the idea of using Charlton characters was abandoned, he decided to model Silk Spectre on superheroines like Phantom Lady and Black Canary (also an alias shared by mother and daughter).

The Sally and Laurie Juspeczyk versions of Silk Spectre made their live-action debuts in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, in which they were played by Carla Gugino and Malin Åkerman, respectively. An older version of Laurie Juspeczyk, now known as Laurie Blake, appeared in the 2019 limited television &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Jean Smart.

==Fictional character history==
===Sally Jupiter===
The first Silk Spectre was a frizzy-haired, redheaded former waitress and burlesque dancer Sally Jupiter (her real last name was &quot;Juspeczyk&quot;, which she changed to hide her Polish ancestry). She assumed the identity of Silk Spectre sometime around 1938 at age 18, in order to advance her modeling career. She became a sex symbol by whom criminals didn&#x27;t mind being caught (or so went her press). She was an action heroine version of a pin-up girl and, even in her old age, she was proud of her sex symbol status, apparently enjoying male attention, as indicated by her reaction to lurid fan letters and her enjoyment of a Tijuana bible based on her (much to her daughter&#x27;s disapproval).

She was soon invited by Captain Metropolis to join The Minutemen, a group of costumed heroes. On October 2, 1940, after a meeting of the Minutemen, Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Blake, alias The Comedian tried to rape her. He was thwarted in his attempt by fellow Minuteman Hooded Justice, who gave him a vicious beating. The event would have a profound impact on Sally&#x27;s life. Her agent, Laurence Schexnayder, persuaded her not to press charges against the Comedian for fear of damaging the group&#x27;s image. More celebrity than vigilante, Silk Spectre provided a cover for Hooded Justice&#x27;s homosexuality by being his glamorous girlfriend. In an interview, she admitted that she didn&#x27;t really like The Silhouette, a.k.a. Ursula Zandt, who had often pestered her about her Polish heritage, but later expressed regret that she was expelled from the group simply because she was a lesbian, especially since there were men on the team who were gay (though she did not identify them). In 1947, Sally retired from crime-fighting and married her agent, Laurence Schexnayder, while keeping in touch with Hollis Mason (Nite Owl) and Nelson Gardner (Captain Metropolis). In 1949, she gave birth to daughter Lauriel Jane Juspeczyk, commonly known as Laurie. It was known to both parents that Laurie was not Laurence&#x27;s child, but The Comedian&#x27;s, from a sexual encounter years after the assault, and this caused conflict in the family, leading the couple to divorce in 1956. While not explicitly stated, it is implied that Sally&#x27;s second sexual encounter with The Comedian was consensual, and that, despite his earlier attack on her, she did have feelings for him.

In the pages of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, it was revealed that Ozymandias spoke at her funeral. While in an asylum, Reggie Long was taught some of Sally&#x27;s moves by fellow inmate Mothman where they both heard of her death.

===Laurie Juspeczyk===
Sally pushed her daughter into the &quot;family business of crimefighting.&quot; Laurel Jane &quot;Laurie&quot; Juspeczyk never held much interest in becoming her mother&#x27;s successor, but went along with Sally&#x27;s wishes anyway. Growing up, the brunette Laurie knew Laurence Schexnayder was not her real father, and she always believed, incorrectly, that her real father was Hooded Justice. Laurie Juspeczyk is a liberal-thinking, modern woman. She is vocal in her feminist and humanitarian concerns, and is quite a conditioned fighter. At the start of the story, she is shown to have a strained relationship with her mother. Driven by the memories of her own experience, Sally tries to keep Laurie from knowing some of the harsher realities of the crime fighting life. For example, she did not allow her to read the Hollis Mason (Nite-Owl I) autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; (which included mention of The Comedian&#x27;s sexual assault on Sally, something Laurie knew nothing of). Sally acted like an agent for her daughter, picking out her costume, and chauffeuring her to &quot;Crimebusters&quot; meetings. After the first of these meetings, Laurie met The Comedian outside, who complimented her for being the spitting image of her mother, but their conversation was broken off quickly by an angry Sally Jupiter. Laurie noted that the Comedian looked sad as he watched them drive away, and felt sorry for him. When Laurie later learned of the sexual assault, she hated The Comedian, though it seems that as time passed, and in a complicated way, Sally was able to come to terms with it, even to the point that she was willing to defend The Comedian from Laurie&#x27;s derogatory remarks after he was murdered (as Laurie was born after an affair with The Comedian). At the same Crimebuster&#x27;s meeting, Laurie met Doctor Manhattan, and the two quickly became attracted to one another, to his long-time girlfriend Janey Slater&#x27;s anger. Shortly afterwards, 16-year-old Laurie became involved with thirty-something Doctor Manhattan, something her mother did not approve of, likening Laurie&#x27;s relationship with Manhattan to being the equivalent of sleeping with an H-bomb. Drawn to him from the moment she first saw him, Laurie worked with Doctor Manhattan in some of his various domestic assignments, including the suppression of riots during the police strike of 1977. Never exactly happy being a vigilante and not happy with the government taking advantage with her relationship with the superhuman Manhattan, Laurie was more than pleased to quit being a superhero when the Keene Act of 1977 forced all but government-sponsored superheroes to retire.

====Events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;====
After retiring, Laurie lived with Manhattan for almost 20 years. However, their relationship became strained, owing to Manhattan&#x27;s growing disconnection with humanity. Laurie eventually left him and moved in with Dan Dreiberg, a.k.a. the second Nite Owl, and the two soon became romantically involved. Dreiberg and Laurie decided to don their old costumes and take Dreiberg&#x27;s airship Archie out. During their flight, they found a building on fire and rescued the inhabitants. Soon after, Laurie was brought to Mars by Dr. Manhattan, where she attempted to convince him to save humanity from impending nuclear war. During their conversation, Laurie finally came to the realization that her real father was The Comedian. Moved by the sheer unlikelihood of two people as different as Sally Jupiter and the Comedian producing a child, and the child being Laurie, Dr. Manhattan realized the miracle and value of human life and agreed to save the planet. The pair returned to earth, only to find half of New York City destroyed by Ozymandias&#x27; creature. They then teleport to Ozymandias&#x27; lair in Antarctica, where Laurie attempts to shoot Ozymandias, only to be thwarted by Ozymandias&#x27; untried ability to catch bullets. After realizing that Ozymandias&#x27; plan had worked, and that, despite the loss of several million lives, nuclear war had been averted while also uniting the nations of the world, the heroes (with the exception of Rorschach) decide that Ozymandias&#x27; plan should be kept secret to serve the greater good.

Shortly after these events, Laurie and Dan Drieberg adopt new appearances and identities, now calling themselves Sam and Sandra Hollis, and sporting blond hair. They visit Sally Jupiter—now living in a retirement home—and Laurie tells her mother that she has realized the truth about her father. The issue is put to rest for Laurie, who accepts that the situation between her mother and the Comedian is too complicated, and she forgives her. &quot;Sam and Sandra&quot; leave soon afterward, indicating that they will continue to adventure, although Laurie expresses the wish for a better superhero identity: leather for better protection, a mask to hide her identity, and a firearm to better fight. This parallels her father&#x27;s, the Comedian, change from a gaudy yellow clown suit to light leather armor with a mask to cover his scar and a variety of guns. After watching them leave, Sally picks up an old photograph of the Minutemen, which includes the Comedian, and kisses his half of the picture as tears roll down her face.

====2010s====
The 2012 miniseries &quot;Before Watchmen: Silk Spectre&quot; revealed that Laurie got her start as a super-hero being trained by her mother to continue the family legacy, before running away from home at the age of 16 and relocating to San Francisco with her boyfriend.

In the 2018 miniseries &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, it is revealed that seven years after the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Sam and Sandra Hollis&quot; have a daughter together. They also adopt Clark, the son of two costumed villains, Mime and Marionette. After jailing the pair following an aborted bank robbery, Dr. Manhattan noted that Marionette was pregnant. He sensed that the child had a bright future ahead of him. In order to preserve that future, he took the boy as an infant following his birth in a prison hospital. Dr. Manhattan named him Clark (after Superman), raised him nearly to his teen years, and after bequeathing Clark his powers and infusing his life force into the planet, brought Clark to the Hollises to raise.

<doc id="720240" wikidata="Q18745" url="?curid=720240" title="Potassium bitartrate">
<text>Potassium bitartrate, also known as potassium hydrogen tartrate, with formula KC4H5O6, is a chemical compound with a number of uses. It is the potassium acid salt of tartaric acid (a carboxylic acid). Especially in cooking, it is also known as cream of tartar.

It is used as a component of baking powders and baking mixes, as mordant in textile dyeing, as reducer of chromium trioxide in mordants for wool, as a metal processing agent that prevents oxidation, as an intermediate for other potassium tartrates, as a cleaning agent when mixed with a weak acid such as vinegar, and as reference standard pH buffer. Medical uses include as a medical cathartic, as a diuretic, and as a historic veterinary laxative and diuretic.

It is produced as a byproduct of winemaking by purifying the precipitate that is deposited in wine barrels. It arises from the tartaric acid and potassium naturally occurring in grapes.

In culinary applications, potassium bitartrate is valued for its role in stabilizing egg whites, which enhances the volume and texture of meringues and soufflés. Its acidic properties prevent sugar syrups from crystallizing, aiding in the production of smooth confections such as candies and frostings. When combined with baking soda, it acts as a leavening agent, producing carbon dioxide gas that helps baked goods rise. Additionally, potassium bitartrate is used to stabilize whipped cream, allowing it to retain its shape for longer periods. 

== History ==
Potassium bitartrate was first characterized by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786). This was a result of Scheele&#x27;s work studying fluorite and hydrofluoric acid.

Scheele may have been the first scientist to publish work on potassium bitartrate, but use of potassium bitartrate has been reported to date back 7000 years to an ancient village in northern Iran. Modern applications of cream of tartar started in 1768 after it gained popularity when the French started using it regularly in their cuisine.

In 2021, a connection between potassium bitartrate and canine and feline toxicity of grapes was first proposed. Since then, it has been deemed likely as the source of grape and raisin toxicity to pets.

==Occurrence==

Potassium bitartrate is naturally formed in grapes from the acid dissociation of tartaric acid into bitartrate and tartrate ions.

Potassium bitartrate has a low solubility in water. It crystallizes in wine casks during the fermentation of grape juice, and can precipitate out of wine in bottles. The rate of potassium bitartrate precipitation depends on the rates of nuclei formation and crystal growth, which varies based on a wine&#x27;s alcohol, sugar, and extract content. The crystals (wine diamonds) will often form on the underside of a cork in wine-filled bottles that have been stored at temperatures below , and will seldom, if ever, dissolve naturally into the wine. Over time, crystal formation is less likely to occur due to the decreasing supersaturation of potassium bitartrate, with the greatest amount of precipitation occurring in the initial few days of cooling.

Historically, it was known as beeswing for its resemblance to the sheen of bees&#x27; wings. It was collected and purified to produce the white, odorless, acidic powder used for many culinary and other household purposes.

These crystals also precipitate out of fresh grape juice that has been chilled or allowed to stand for some time. To prevent crystals from forming in homemade grape jam or jelly, the prerequisite fresh grape juice should be chilled overnight to promote crystallization. The potassium bitartrate crystals are removed by filtering through two layers of cheesecloth. The filtered juice may then be made into jam or jelly. In some cases they adhere to the side of the chilled container, making filtering unnecessary.

The presence of crystals is less prevalent in red wines than in white wines. This is because red wines have a higher amount of tannin and colouring matter present as well as a higher sugar and extract content than white wines. Various methods such as promoting crystallization and filtering, removing the active species required for potassium bitartrate precipitation, and adding additives have been implemented to reduce the presence of potassium bitartrate crystals in wine.

==Applications==

===In food===

In food, potassium bitartrate is used for:
* Stabilizing egg whites, increasing their warmth-tolerance and volume
* Stabilizing whipped cream, maintaining its texture and volume
* Anti-caking and thickening
* Preventing sugar syrups from crystallizing by causing some of the sucrose to break down into glucose and fructose
* Reducing discoloration of boiled vegetables

Additionally, it is used as a component of:
* Baking powder, as an acid ingredient to activate baking soda
* Salt substitutes, in combination with potassium chloride

A similar acid salt, sodium acid pyrophosphate, can be confused with cream of tartar because of its common function as a component of baking powder.

=== Baking ===
Adding cream of tartar to egg whites gives volume to cakes, and makes them more tender. As cream of tartar is added, the pH decreases to around the isoelectric point of the foaming proteins in egg whites. Foaming properties of egg whites are optimal at this pH due to increased protein-protein interactions. The low pH also results in a whiter crumb in cakes due to flour pigments that respond to these pH changes. However, adding too much cream of tartar (&gt;2.4% weight of egg white) can affect the texture and taste of cakes. The optimal cream of tartar concentration to increase volume and the whiteness of interior crumbs without making the cake too tender, is about 1/4 tsp per egg white.

As an acid, cream of tartar with heat reduces sugar crystallization in invert syrups by helping to break down sucrose into its monomer components - fructose and glucose in equal parts. Preventing the formation of sugar crystals makes the syrup have a non-grainy texture, shinier and less prone to break and dry. However, a downside of relying on cream of tartar to thin out crystalline sugar confections (like fudge) is that it can be hard to add the right amount of acid to get the desired consistency.

Cream of tartar is used as a type of acid salt that is crucial in baking powder. Upon dissolving in batter or dough, the tartaric acid that is released reacts with baking soda to form carbon dioxide that is used for leavening. Since cream of tartar is fast-acting, it releases over 70 percent of carbon dioxide gas during mixing.

=== Household use ===
Potassium bitartrate can be mixed with an acidic liquid, such as lemon juice or white vinegar, to make a paste-like cleaning agent for metals, such as brass, aluminium, or copper, or with water for other cleaning applications, such as removing light stains from porcelain.
This mixture is sometimes mistakenly made with vinegar and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which actually react to neutralize each other, creating carbon dioxide and a sodium acetate solution.

Cream of tartar was often used in traditional dyeing where the complexing action of the tartrate ions was used to adjust the solubility and hydrolysis of mordant salts such as tin chloride and alum.

Cream of tartar, when mixed into a paste with hydrogen peroxide, can be used to clean rust from some hand tools, notably hand files. The paste is applied, left to set for a few hours, and then washed off with a baking soda/water solution. After another rinse with water and thorough drying, a thin application of oil will protect the file from further rusting.

Slowing the set time of plaster of Paris products (most widely used in gypsum plaster wall work and artwork casting) is typically achieved by the simple introduction of almost any acid diluted into the mixing water. A commercial retardant premix additive sold by USG to trade interior plasterers includes at least 40% potassium bitartrate. The remaining ingredients are the same plaster of Paris and quartz-silica aggregate already prominent in the main product. This means that the only active ingredient is the cream of tartar.

===Cosmetics===
For dyeing hair, potassium bitartrate can be mixed with henna as the mild acid needed to activate the henna.

===Medicinal use===
Cream of tartar has been used internally as a purgative, but this is dangerous because an excess of potassium, or hyperkalemia, may occur.

===Chemistry===
Potassium bitartrate is the United States&#x27; National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s primary reference standard for a pH buffer. Using an excess of the salt in water, a saturated solution is created with a pH of 3.557 at . Upon dissolution in water, potassium bitartrate will dissociate into acid tartrate, tartrate, and potassium ions. Thus, a saturated solution creates a buffer with standard pH. Before use as a standard, it is recommended that the solution be filtered or decanted between and .

Potassium carbonate can be made by burning cream of tartar, which produces &quot;pearl ash&quot;. This process is now obsolete but produced a higher quality (reasonable purity) than &quot;potash&quot; extracted from wood or other plant ashes.

== Production ==
It is produced as a byproduct of winemaking by purifying the precipitate that is deposited in wine barrels. It arises from the tartaric acid and potassium naturally occurring in grapes.

<text>Adrian Alexander Veidt, also known as Ozymandias ( ), is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, published by DC Comics. Created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, named &quot;Ozymandias&quot; in the manner of Ramesses II, his name recalls the famous poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley, which takes as its theme the fleeting nature of empire and is excerpted as the epigraph of one of the chapters of &quot;Watchmen&quot;. 

Ozymandias is ranked number 25 on &quot;Wizard&quot;″s Top 200 Comic Book Characters list and number 21 on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Villains list.

Veidt made his live-action debut in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Matthew Goode. An older Adrian Veidt appeared in the 2019 limited television series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Jeremy Irons.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===
Adrian Veidt was born in 1939, and is the son of wealthy German-American immigrant parents. As a child, he received high grades in school, and it was noted that he was very intelligent. He then hid this information from his elders and peers by deliberately achieving average marks. After his parents&#x27; deaths, he inherited their substantial fortune at age seventeen, but chose to give it all to charity as he wanted to make something of himself on his own. Veidt embarked on a vision quest, following the route of his childhood Alexander the Great. During an excursion into the Middle East, Veidt consumed a ball of hashish and saw visions of the past. As he finished his travels in Egypt, he realized that Alexander was a pale imitation of Ramesses II, who became Veidt&#x27;s new hero. On returning to the US, he began training himself to achieve peak physical condition, becoming a world-class gymnast in the process.

===Superhero career===
At age 19, Veidt named himself Ozymandias (the Greek name for Ramesses II) and became a costumed vigilante, earning a reputation as &quot;the smartest man on the planet” and using his physical skills to non-violently incapacitate opponents. He debuted in early 1958 by exposing a drug ring in New York City. In 1966, he was invited by former Minuteman and adventurer Captain Metropolis to become a member of the Crimebusters, but the group never came to fruition due to the Comedian&#x27;s breaking up of the meeting. It was at this moment that Veidt began to believe superheroics were not enough to save the world, and began plotting a method that could.

===After being a superhero===

Due to the increasingly negative perceptions of vigilantes by the media, Veidt predicted that the public would turn away from them. Two years before costumed heroes were banned by the Keene Act, Adrian Veidt revealed his secret identity, retired from superheroism and marketed his image. He became very wealthy and was known as a great humanitarian, and used this to bankroll his secret scheme of creating a catastrophic event to deceive the world into uniting against a common enemy and thus avert nuclear war. Upon completion of his project, Veidt planned to murder all of his (unwitting) accomplices and arrange the psychological deterioration and self-exile of the presumably invincible Doctor Manhattan.

Fellow vigilante Edward Blake, a.k.a. the Comedian, stumbled upon Veidt&#x27;s plans. This led Veidt to personally murder the Comedian, setting off the chain of events told in the story of &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

===Events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
Veidt is first seen when Rorschach visits him to get his opinion on Blake&#x27;s murder and to warn about a possible serial killer targeting superheroes. Rorschach is unconvinced of Veidt&#x27;s theory that Blake was assassinated by a bitter arch-rival. Veidt is one of the few people attending Blake&#x27;s funeral, at which he reminisces about the failed Crimebusters meeting. Later, Veidt narrowly escapes an assassination attempt that leaves his assistant dead. The would-be assassin dies from an unseen cyanide capsule before Veidt can interrogate him.

Rorschach and Nite Owl deduce that Veidt is behind the whole plot after they link one of Veidt&#x27;s shell companies to a plot to discredit Manhattan. The duo realize that Veidt exposed Manhattan&#x27;s former lover, colleagues, and an enemy to radiation and deliberately monitored them for cancer, so Manhattan would flee Earth out of either guilt or public enmity. When Rorschach and Nite Owl arrive at Veidt&#x27;s Antarctic retreat, he easily overpowers both of them and explains his plan to save humanity from itself: teleport a biologically-engineered, telepathic creature to New York which would kill millions and convince the world that they were under extraterrestrial attack. The US and the Soviet Union, on the brink of nuclear confrontation, would then join forces against the supposed alien invaders. He also admits to framing Manhattan, killing the Comedian, framing Rorschach for the murder of Moloch, and staging the attempt on taking his own life, killing his attacker. When Rorschach and Nite Owl ask him when he planned to execute his scheme, Veidt reveals that he had already done so 35 minutes earlier, even before their arrival at his retreat.

When Doctor Manhattan and Silk Spectre confront Veidt, he attempts to disintegrate Manhattan in the intrinsic field subtractor while sacrificing his genetically-altered pet lynx Bubastis, but Doctor Manhattan is able to reform himself. Silk Spectre attempts to shoot him, but he catches the bullet and knocks her out. Realizing that exposing Veidt&#x27;s plan will undo the nascent world peace, most of the heroes agree to remain silent on the plot. Rorschach, a moral absolutist, prepares to return to the US and reveal Veidt&#x27;s plan to the world, but ultimately lets Manhattan kill him. Before Manhattan leaves to create life in another galaxy, Veidt asks him if he &quot;did the right thing in the end.&quot; Manhattan replies that &quot;nothing ever ends&quot;, leaving Veidt in doubt about how long the peace will last. Unknown to Veidt and the other characters, Rorschach has previously mailed a journal detailing his findings about Veidt&#x27;s plan to a New York newspaper. The editors&#x27; decision on whether or not to publish the journal is not revealed.

===&quot;Before Watchmen&quot;===
A six-part series on Ozymandias titled &quot;Before Watchmen: Ozymandias&quot; had its first issue released in July 2012. It is written by Len Wein, with art by Jae Lee. This is part of a planned 35-issue &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; series.

===Events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;===
Seven years after the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Rorschach&#x27;s journal is released to the public and Veidt becomes a fugitive. Having purportedly been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and knowing that his plan to save the world has failed, Veidt recruits a man bearing the Rorschach moniker and has him break Erika Manson (Marionette) and her husband Marcos Maez (Mime) out of prison. When Rorschach II returns with the two, Veidt reveals himself and his situation, explaining to the two criminals that they must follow Manhattan to another universe and convince him to save their world. In addition, he also cloned Bubastis from his salvaged DNA to help find Doctor Manhattan due to it having some of Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s energy which is needed to find him.

Using the Owlship, Veidt and his group travel to the DC Universe just as nuclear war breaks out on their Earth. After conducting research on this new world he&#x27;s found himself in, Veidt goes to Metropolis to ask Lex Luthor to join his quest. However, as he is pleading his case, Veidt is shocked to find himself being confronted by the Comedian, who has been transported to the DC Universe by Manhattan. The Comedian turns out to be evenly matched with Veidt, forcing him to retreat through Luthor&#x27;s office window.

Veidt falls twenty stories and is hospitalized with minor injuries, but soon manages to escape. Upon returning to the Owlship, Veidt is confronted by Batman, who has read the contents of the original Rorschach&#x27;s journal. As the two elude the police, Batman asserts that Veidt murdered millions as part of a delusional hero syndrome, and accuses him of concocting a conspiracy theory that has negatively affected the public&#x27;s trust in the superheroes of the DC Universe. Veidt in turn criticizes Batman for focusing all his attention on supervillains while ignoring the world&#x27;s social problems. A struggle ensues, leading to Batman falling out of the Owlship and into a mob of anti-hero protestors below.

Rorschach II, Saturn Girl and Johnny Thunder meet up with Veidt at the Owlship. With his pet lynx, Bubastis II, and the Lantern Battery, Veidt travels to Manhattan&#x27;s location at the Joker&#x27;s lair, where Batman is fighting Marionette and Mime. Leaving Johnny and Saturn Girl on the Owlship, Veidt and Rorschach II confront the others inside. Veidt uses Bubastis II to summon Manhattan, who refuses to return to their world since he&#x27;s in the middle of experimenting with this one. Manhattan reveals, among other things, that Veidt lied to Rorschach II about having cancer in order to get his help. Rorschach II punches Veidt and flees, while Veidt returns to the Owlship, attacks Imra and Johnny, and declares he can save everyone. Veidt then uses Bubastis&#x27; energy to cause an explosion in Moscow, which creates a diplomatic crisis as well as framing Superman and Firestorm. As planned by Veidt, most of Earth&#x27;s superheroes go to Mars to confront Manhattan, who they think is responsible. After defeating all the superheroes on Mars, Manhattan returns to Earth and confronts Superman. Manhattan is eventually convinced by Superman to use his powers for the greater good and to return to his Universe to save his Earth. Veidt then reveals that his plan was to engineer the confrontation between Manhattan and Superman as he had guessed that only the latter could change Manhattan&#x27;s mind. Veidt is shot by the Comedian, but Rorschach stops the bleeding so Veidt can face prosecution. Rorschach II and Veidt are then teleported by Doctor Manhattan back to the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe, where Veidt is imprisoned for his crimes.

==Skills and abilities==
Adrian Veidt has been deemed &quot;the smartest man in the world&quot; by many, mainly the media, though this title is regarded as well-deserved. From his earliest memories Veidt has been aware of his superior insight; also, his brain possesses a photographic memory. Following his service as the costumed vigilante Ozymandias, Veidt has deftly built empires legitimate and criminal each; the extent of them combined is enough for him to become a global influence through his exploitation of advanced technology and genetics.

Yearning for a practical measure of his abilities, Veidt’s ambition necessarily matches his estimation of his intelligence, as evidenced by his successful execution of his plan to help Earth towards utopia by ending international hostilities. He is shown to be a ruthless master strategist, maintaining total secrecy in swiftly eliminating anybody who dares to get in the way of his plans, or who is aware of his plans, or who unknowingly participates—even, ultimately, his most trusted conspirators.

Additionally, Veidt is depicted as having developed himself to the pinnacle of human physical ability. A world-class athlete, he is extremely physically fit and performs public exhibitions of his acrobatic feats in order to aid charity events. He is exceptionally active despite his age (mid-forties at the time of the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;). Included as a back-up feature to issue #11, a Veidt interview conducted by Doug Roth notes Veidt as resembling a man of 30 rather than one of middle age.

Unknown to others, he has conditioned himself even to catch a bullet with his hand, though he himself was surprised when he managed to do so successfully. He is an almost superhuman unarmed combatant who easily defeats such indomitable fighters as Rorschach and Nite Owl, both at once. His only known melee defeat came early in his career at the hands of the Comedian, whom he later bested and killed, seemingly with that loss in mind.

==Feature film and script versions==
In a 1989 Sam Hamm film draft, Veidt&#x27;s goal is to go back in time to kill Jonathan Osterman before he becomes Dr. Manhattan, because he reasons that Manhattan&#x27;s existence has led America to nuclear war with the Russians. Veidt is unable to kill Osterman in the past, but Osterman decides to alter the past so that Dr. Manhattan is never &quot;born.&quot; By sacrificing his present self, Dr. Manhattan allows the human Osterman to have a normal life, but he kills Veidt before he could kill him in the past. In the 2003 David Hayter film draft script, Veidt plans to fire a solar radiation beam into New York; Veidt&#x27;s plan succeeds, but Veidt also intends to kill Nite Owl and Silk Spectre afterwards. Nite Owl kills Veidt in self-defense.

Miaoli is bordered by Hsinchu County and Hsinchu City to the north, Taichung to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the west. Miaoli is classified as &quot;central Taiwan&quot; by the National Development Council and &quot;northern Taiwan&quot; by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. Miaoli City is the capital of the county, and is also known as &quot;Mountain Town&quot;, owing to the number of mountains nearby, making it a destination for hiking.

==Name==
The name &quot;Miaoli&quot; was coined by matching Hakka Chinese sound for the characters 貓貍 to the phonetically approximate &quot;Pali&quot; (&quot;Bari&quot;) from the Taokas language. The resulting word () is a widespread but non-orthodox variant referring to Viverridae. In 1889, during late Qing rule, the name was modified from various forms () to its current form.

They mainly led an agriculture life and engaged in hunting and fishing for their extra food source. About a thousand years ago, an indigenous group Taokas settled here.

In the mid-17th century, Han Chinese began to migrate into the area, beginning a gradual process of deforestation and establishment of permanent settlement sites. Most inhabitants of Miaoli assimilated into the dominant Han population or migrated deeper into the mountainous range. After several hundred years, Miaoli had become the home of people from different origins, such as Hakka, Hoklo, Atayal and Saisiyat.

<text>KHJ (930 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station that is licensed to Los Angeles, California. Owned and operated by Relevant Radio, Inc., the station broadcasts Roman Catholic religious programming as the network&#x27;s West Coast flagship station.

KHJ broadcasts at 5,000 watts, with a non-directional signal by day but using a directional antenna at night to protect other stations on 930 AM. KHJ&#x27;s transmitter is triplexed to three of the six towers of KBLA (1580 AM), near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Alvarado Street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Radio station KYPA (1230 AM) also uses two of KBLA&#x27;s towers for its signal. KHJ&#x27;s former towers at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Mid-City were removed in February 2013.

KHJ was a top 40 station from 1965 to 1980. The station switched to a country music format in 1980 and back to pop music in 1983. In 1986, KHJ changed its call letters to KRTH, adopting an oldies format as a sister station to KRTH-FM (101.1 FM). Three years later, the station was sold to Liberman Broadcasting who aired Spanish-language formats from 1990 to 2014, using the call letters KKHJ until 2000, when it regained its original calls.

==History==

===1920s and 1930s===

Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. government adopted regulations formally defining &quot;broadcasting stations&quot;. The wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) was designated for entertainment broadcasts, while 485 meters (619 kHz) was reserved for broadcasting official weather and other government reports.

KHJ was first licensed on March 18, 1922, to C. R. Kierulff &amp; Company in Los Angeles, for operation on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength. The Kierulff company acted as contractors responsible for installing the station in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; building at First and Broadway, and in November the newspaper&#x27;s owner, the Times Mirror Company, became the official licensee. The KHJ call letters were randomly assigned from a roster of available call signs, although the station quickly adopted the slogan &quot;Kindness, Happiness and Joy&quot;. Test transmissions began on April 8. The station&#x27;s formal debut broadcast was held on April 13 from 6:45 to 7:45 p.m., featuring, in the words of the newspaper, &quot;the powerful baritone voice of Joseph Schwarz of the Chicago Grand Opera Company in the prologue from &#x27;I Pagliacci&#x27;, and a dulcet tonal treat by Edith Mason, diva of the same company, and flashing the news of the world to the Southwest&quot;.

1922 saw a rapid expansion in the number of broadcasting stations, most sharing the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters, which required progressively more complicated time sharing schedules among stations in the same region. In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming, and KHJ was assigned to this more exclusive wavelength, where it was later joined, on a timesharing basis, by KFI. Along with the 400 meter authorization, KHJ was also authorized to broadcast on the 485 meter &quot;market and weather reports&quot; wavelength. In May 1923 additional &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies were made available, with Los Angeles allocated 640 and 760 kHz, and KHJ was assigned to 760 kHz, while KFI moved to 640 kHz.

In early 1925, KHJ was assigned to 740 kHz. The Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was formed in early 1927. That fall it moved KHJ to 720 kHz, and in early 1928 the station was reassigned to 750 kHz. On November 11, 1928, the FRC made a major reallocation under the provisions of its General Order 40, which moved KHJ to 900 kHz, a frequency designated for &quot;regional&quot; service, with 1,000 watts of power

For a short time during the late 1920s and early 1930s KHJ was the Los Angeles affiliate and West Coast production hub of the fledgling CBS radio network, the originating station for Bing Crosby&#x27;s first national network radio show in 1931. On April 29, 1934, the cartoon character Donald Duck made his first appearance, on the &quot;California Melodies&quot; radio program of KHJ, a few days before he debuted in animated form in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot;. CBS would eventually purchase a more-powerful West Coast flagship station, 50,000-watt KNX, and part company with KHJ. The station was purchased in the fall of 1927 by Don Lee, a local automobile dealer who also owned KFRC (610 AM) in San Francisco and eventually accumulated 21 radio stations. In 1949, the broadcasting company, including KHJ, merged with RKO General.

On December 18, 1934, KHJ was one of four stations granted permission to increase power to 5,000 watts. In 1941, a major reorganization of the AM band by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC, successor to the FRC), due to the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, moved the station to 930 kHz, where it continues to operate.

During Lee&#x27;s ownership KHJ became the West Coast flagship station of the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of the &quot;big four&quot; radio networks (with CBS, NBC, and ABC) from the 1930s to the 1970s. George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Steve Allen appeared on KHJ, and at one point the station employed a 50-piece orchestra to accompany its musical guests. On a 1931 broadcast (a portion of which survives) KHJ introduced an up-and-coming singer, Bing Crosby. Pat Weaver (president of NBC, creator of &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and father of Sigourney Weaver) was a KHJ announcer.

===&quot;Boss Radio&quot;===
In April 1965, programming consultant Bill Drake crafted KHJ&#x27;s top 40 format. Drake hired program director Ron Jacobs, who had created formats in Hawaii and California. The format, known as &quot;Boss Radio&quot;, featured a restricted playlist and restrained commentary by announcers (although a few, such as Robert W. Morgan, Charlie Tuna, Humble Harve Miller, and The Real Don Steele, were allowed to develop on-air personas). Other DJs from this era (1965–1980) included Roger Christian, Gary Mack, Dave Diamond, Beau Weaver, John Leader, Sam Riddle, Johnny Williams, Frank Terry, Johnny Mitchell, Tommy Vance, Scotty Brink, Steve Clark, Bobby Tripp, Tom Maule, and Bill Wade. One defining characteristic of Boss Radio was the jingles by the Johnny Mann Singers. Drake&#x27;s format spread throughout North America, bringing high ratings to KFRC in San Francisco, WFIL in Philadelphia, KGB in San Diego, WQXI in Atlanta, WRKO in Boston, and CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (serving Detroit). Drake and his business partner Gene Chenault brought many of their announcers from the other Boss stations, using those stations as a farm system to develop talent.

KHJ&#x27;s call-in request number used the Los Angeles area code 213 and a 520 exchange, followed by the current year. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station competed with three other local stations with similar formats: KFI, KTNQ, and Tijuana-based border blaster XETRA-AM (The Mighty 690). KHJ also competed with three &quot;soul radio&quot; stations serving the Los Angeles radio market: KDAY, KGFJ, and, from Rosarito, Mexico, XERB.

In mid-1970, a KHJ contest led to a fatality and a large legal judgment against RKO General. That summer, the station ran a series of contests known as the &quot;Super Summer Spectacular&quot;. In the contests, the Real Don Steele drove a red car to a particular area and announcers encouraged listeners to find him with clues as to his whereabouts. The first person who found Steele and fulfilled a condition received a cash prize and was interviewed by Steele. The conditions varied, from answering a question to possessing certain items of clothing. An example of an on-air clue was: &quot;The Real Don Steele is moving into Canoga Park — so be on the lookout for him. I&#x27;ll tell you what will happen if you get to The Real Don Steele. He&#x27;s got twenty-five dollars to give away if you can get it ... and baby, all signed and sealed and delivered and wrapped up.&quot; At the time, KHJ had the largest teenage audience in the Los Angeles area (48 percent, compared to its nearest competitor&#x27;s 13 percent).

On July 16, 1970, two teenagers, following Steele in separate cars, drove at speeds up to so they could be closest to him when the next clue was announced. One of the teenagers forced another motorist, 32-year-old Ronald Weirum, off the road; Weirum was killed when his car overturned. Weirum&#x27;s wife and children filed a wrongful-death suit against both teenagers, the manufacturer of Weirum&#x27;s car, and RKO General. One of the teenagers settled the case before the trial for the limits of his insurance policy. A jury found in favor of the car&#x27;s manufacturer, but found both the second teenager and RKO General liable for the accident and awarded the plaintiffs $300,000 in damages. RKO General appealed to the California Supreme Court, which upheld the verdict in 1975. The higher court ruled that KHJ negligently created an undue risk to the public by causing a situation in which its listeners were encouraged to race on the roads, and that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the contest&#x27;s risk of harm to the public (including Weirum) was foreseeable.

===End of an era===

The format brought high ratings to the station until the late 1970s, when FM radio became the dominant form of music broadcasting. On November 7, 1980, at 9p.m., during Bob Shannon&#x27;s show, and after the song &quot;Rock and Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)&quot; by Mac Davis was played, KHJ switched from top 40 to a country music format with the slogan &quot;We all grew up to be cowboys&quot;. The change attempted to capitalize on the rise of pop-driven country, a trend driven in part by the film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; which was released that year. However, that format lasted only three years. On April 1, 1983, KHJ switched to an oldies format: &quot;The Boss is Back&quot;, featuring the original Johnny Mann Singers&#x27; Boss Radio jingles. In 1984, KHJ launched &quot;Car Radio 93&quot;, a top 40 variant targeting driving commuters, featuring traffic reports every ten minutes.

On the evening of January 31, 1986, &quot;Car Radio&quot; DJ Dave Sebastian Williams was joined in the studio by Robert W. Morgan. Participants in KHJ&#x27;s Boss Radio heyday (DJs M.G. Kelly, Bobby Ocean, and Jimmy Rabbitt, and program director Ron Jacobs) phoned in for a farewell broadcast, playing the songs which had made KHJ a popular AM station in the 1960s and 1970s. The last song played on KHJ was &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. On February 1, at Midnight, the station adopted new call letters KRTH to match those of its FM sister station and a format known as &quot;Smokin&#x27; Oldies&quot;, featuring hits from the rock and roll era&#x27;s first decade. The station used &quot;AM 930&quot; as its moniker. With the format change, RKO General dismissed about two dozen staff members from both stations.

===Switch to Spanish and call-sign problem===

RKO General had been under investigation by federal regulators since the 1960s for unethical conduct at its television stations, including KRTH&#x27;s television sister KHJ-TV. The company was eventually ruled an unfit broadcast licensee and was compelled by the FCC to sell its broadcast properties. In January 1989, RKO sold KRTH-AM-FM to Beasley Broadcasting for $86.6 million. That October, Beasley spun off the AM station to Liberman Broadcasting for $23 million; this transaction closed in March 1990. During this period, KRTH dropped the &quot;Smokin&#x27; Oldies&quot; format and simulcasted KRTH-FM&#x27;s broad-based oldies format. Upon closing, KRTH became a full-time Spanish-language station broadcasting a regional Mexican music format branded &quot;Radio Alegria&quot;. Liberman changed the station&#x27;s call letters to KKHJ in honor of its history as KHJ. From November 1997 to January 1999, KKHJ aired a Spanish all-news format, the only one of its kind in the United States. The station&#x27;s ratings suffered, prompting a return to regional Mexican as &quot;La Ranchera&quot;.

Program director Alfredo Rodriguez and chief engineer Jerry Lewine wished to bring back the original KHJ call sign; however, the FCC stopped issuing three-letter call signs to radio stations in the 1930s. Rodriguez and Lewine conceived a plan to convince the FCC to change the station&#x27;s call sign. Since the Spanish pronunciation of KKHJ&#x27;s first two letters (&quot;kah-kah&quot;) sounded like &quot;caca&quot; (slang for &quot;feces&quot;), the call letters were pronounced in English for a decade. This was considered awkward for a Hispanophone broadcaster, so the station collected letters from listeners and lobbied the FCC to allow the station to drop one of its letters. The commission allowed the station to return to its original call, KHJ, on March 15, 2000.

On August 21, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers reached a deal with KHJ to broadcast the team&#x27;s games in Spanish for the 2008 season, moving from KWKW after 20 years there.

===Switch to Catholic Radio format===

On July 15, 2014, Liberman reached an agreement to sell KHJ to IHR Educational Broadcasting for $9.75 million; the sale was consummated on November 6. At that time, KHJ began Catholic-oriented religious programming; the &quot;La Ranchera&quot; format moved to KWIZ (96.7 FM) in Santa Ana, California. The format change marked the station returning to English-language programming.

KHJ switched to the Relevant Radio branding when IHR Educational Broadcasting and Starboard Media Foundation consummated their merger on June 30, 2017. On May 2, 2018, the FCC granted Immaculate Heart Media&#x27;s request to switch KHJ&#x27;s license from non-commercial educational to commercial status.

==Legacy==
A low-power FM (LPFM) station in Madras, Oregon, KHJA-LP (102.1 FM), aired an oldies format as a tribute to the 1960s–1970s era KHJ and used the Los Angeles station&#x27;s logo, jingles, and &quot;Boss Radio&quot; slogans. (In 2008, it changed its call sign to KGBZ-LP and started re-broadcasting a Spanish Christian network called &quot;Ondas de Vida&quot; from California.) In 2016, a new LPFM in Albany, Oregon, was issued the call sign KHJJ-LP on a frequency of 105.3 FM. It adopted the nickname KHJFM as a tribute to the original &quot;93 KHJ&quot; as programmed by Bill Drake. Los Angeles area &quot;Boss Jocks&quot; who worked at the original 93 KHJ are heard on this station.

WKHJ (104.5 FM), a hot adult contemporary station in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, has always used the &quot;KHJ&quot; nickname. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, country station CKHJ used the moniker KHJ until 2019, when it rebranded as &quot;Pure Country&quot;.

The KKHJ call sign used during the 1990s by Liberman was assigned to an FM station in American Samoa. That station broadcasts on 93.1 FM and uses the &quot;93 KHJ&quot; on-air name and jingles.

An aircheck sample of an old KHJ jingle is heard at the beginning of &quot;AM Radio&quot; by Everclear. Harry Chapin, on his &quot;Greatest Stories Live&quot; album, refers to KHJ in &quot;WOLD&quot; (&quot;I am the morning DJ at 93 KHJ, playing all the hits for you, play them night and day&quot;) to the audience&#x27;s delight; the song was probably recorded in a location served by KHJ.

The 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; features the Boss Radio era of KHJ. The movie and official soundtrack album include airchecks of boss jocks Humble Harve and The Real Don Steele as well as original 93 KHJ jingles and advertisements.

<text>Philip Gary &quot;Flip&quot; Sloan (&quot;né&quot; Schlein; September 18, 1945 – November 15, 2015), known professionally as P. F. Sloan, was an American singer and songwriter. During the mid-1960s, he wrote, performed, and produced many &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 20 hits for artists such as Barry McGuire, the Searchers, Jan and Dean, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Johnny Rivers, the Grass Roots, the Turtles, and the Mamas and the Papas.

Sloan&#x27;s signature song is &quot;Eve of Destruction,&quot; a 1965 U.S. number one for McGuire. Many of his songs were written in collaboration with Steve Barri. Their partnership yielded two US Top Ten hits—Herman&#x27;s Hermits&#x27; &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot; (1965) and Johnny Rivers&#x27; &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; (1966)—and the Turtles&#x27; &quot;You Baby&quot; (1966).

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
Sloan was born in New York City, United States, to an American father and a Romanian-born mother. His family moved to West Hollywood, California in 1957, where his father, a pharmacist, changed the family name from &quot;Schlein&quot; to &quot;Sloan&quot; after repeatedly being denied a liquor license for his store. When Sloan was 13 his father bought him a guitar. While at the music store in Hollywood, Sloan met Elvis Presley, who gave him an impromptu music lesson. In 1959, at 14, &quot;Flip&quot; Sloan recorded a single, &quot;All I Want Is Loving&quot; / &quot;Little Girl in the Cabin&quot; for the L.A. R&amp;B record label Aladdin Records, which folded soon after its release.

At 16, he became part of the burgeoning Los Angeles music scene, landing a job on the songwriting staff at music publisher Screen Gems, which was then the largest publisher on the West Coast. There, he formed a partnership with Steve Barri, and the duo made several attempts at recording a hit single under names such as Philip and Stephan, The Rally-Packs, The Wildcats, The Street Cleaners, Themes Inc., and The Lifeguards. In 1963, they came to the attention of Screen Gems executive Lou Adler, who decided to use them as backing singers and musicians (Sloan on lead guitar and Barri on percussion) for Jan and Dean, whom he managed. Sloan and Barri wrote the theme song for the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; (Teen Age Music International Show) and were credited on all Jan and Dean albums from &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve / The New Girl in School&quot; in early 1964 through &quot;Command Performance&quot; in 1965. Jan Berry used Sloan as the lead falsetto voice instead of Dean Torrence on the band&#x27;s top 10 hit &quot;The Little Old Lady from Pasadena&quot;. Around that time, Sloan and Barri also wrote their first U.S. Billboard Top 100 hit, &quot;Kick That Little Foot Sally Ann&quot;, arranged by Jack Nitzsche and performed by a Watts, California-born artist named Round Robin. Soon they also appeared on surf records by Bruce &amp; Terry and the Rip Chords, and they recorded their own surf singles and album as The Fantastic Baggys.

=== Dunhill Records ===
Adler then doubled their salaries to hire them for his startup publisher Trousdale Music and startup label Dunhill Records. Using the name Phil F. Sloan or P.F. Sloan (the &quot;F&quot; stood for &quot;Flip&quot;, his nickname), Sloan wrote or co-wrote hits for many performers, including &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; (Barry McGuire); &quot;You Baby&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be&quot; (The Turtles); &quot;A Must to Avoid&quot; and &quot;Hold On!&quot; (Herman&#x27;s Hermits); &quot;Take Me For What I&#x27;m Worth&quot; (The Searchers); and &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; (Johnny Rivers). This last song was the theme tune for &quot;Danger Man&quot;, a British TV series that had been given a new title (&quot;Secret Agent&quot;) and theme for the US market. Due to its line &quot;You&#x27;re old enough to kill, but not for votin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; was used as a rallying cry by supporters of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed the voting age from 21 to 18 as of 1971.

Sloan also became a session guitarist as part of the group of L.A. session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew, working with such well-known backing musicians as drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, bassists Joe Osborn and Carol Kaye, and bassist/keyboardist Larry Knechtel, among others. While working with Barry McGuire, Sloan created and played a guitar introduction as a hook to a new song by John Phillips entitled &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, and the same backing track was used for the hit version by Phillips&#x27; group The Mamas &amp; the Papas, which led to Sloan being a regular in their recording sessions. Sloan generally played the lead guitar tracks on most of the songs he wrote, including the famous riff in &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;.

Sloan and Barri also were performers while on Dunhill. They released Dunhill&#x27;s first album, a collection of surf instrumentals, as the &quot;Rincon Surfside Band&quot;, and the album was later issued by RCA under the name &quot;Willie and the Wheels&quot;. Sloan&#x27;s successful folk-influenced songwriting caused Dunhill to record two solo albums by him. His single &quot;Sins of a Family&quot; reached the Billboard top 100 in fall 1965, in the wake of the huge success of &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;.

During this time, Sloan &amp; Barri continued to do session work with Jan Berry of Jan &amp; Dean, until Jan&#x27;s near-fatal car wreck in April 1966, which basically ended Jan &amp; Dean&#x27;s career. They also produced a number of other acts, from Ann-Margret to The Robbs to Canadians Terry Black and Patrician-Anne McKinnon (both of whom had hits in Canada with Sloan-Barri songs) to Dunhill acts such as Shelley Fabares, The Ginger Snaps featuring Dandee Duncan, The Thomas Group (headed by Danny Thomas&#x27;s son Tony), and The Iguanas (a Mexican band that did not speak English).

The main Sloan-Barri recording effort for Dunhill was done under the name The Grass Roots. However, after The Grass Roots enjoyed a Billboard Top 30 single with &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album failed to chart, and Dunhill forced Sloan and Barri to recruit a real band to perform as The Grass Roots. Ultimately, a second band had to be recruited after the first one quit. Sloan and Barri continued as producers for the band, and they quickly generated a U.S. top 10 hit with a cover of the European hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Live for Today&quot; (by the British band The Rokes). After that, though, the new Grass Roots wanted to write their own songs, and Sloan, who still wanted to be a recording artist, became alienated from both Barri and Dunhill management.

During this period, P.F. Sloan&#x27;s growing experience and reputation also attracted the attention of other young and aspiring musical artists, seeking both musical and business advice. As a favor to a friend, Sloan in 1968 first met the relatively unknown Jimmy Webb at a private home for an informal but eye-opening visit. The very first song Webb played for him was &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;. Sloan recalls, &quot;He played a couple of chords and began to unload. I was aware immediately that I was listening to a songwriter&#x27;s voice. It was filled with feeling and emotion. Most songwriters don&#x27;t have a voice, but this one was haunting and unusual and raw and wonderful.&quot; Sloan further explains, &quot;There are singers and there are songwriters, and only rarely is there something known as a singer-songwriter. Singer-songwriters were a threat to the establishment. And I was one of them.&quot; Sloan explains that as the song continued, he felt relaxed at first, then nervously on edge &quot;...figuring that he would screw the song up in some way. But he didn&#x27;t. The song got better and better.&quot; This was followed by &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; and an early version of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. The next song, &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, brought Sloan to tears. Sloan assured Webb that every song could be a major hit, quipping that &quot;Songwriters don&#x27;t cry tears, they cry diamonds.&quot;

According to Barri, Sloan changed after the success of &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;: &quot;He was two people. We were just two Jewish kids from New York. We liked the same movies. We played Wiffle ball together. But when &#x27;Eve of Destruction&#x27; became such a smash, he went with Barry McGuire to England, and he came back a different person. His girlfriend, who I later married—both of us felt he never returned from England. He was a major, major talent. God, he was good.&quot; Sloan himself also described a change at this time: &quot;I wanted to be loved. I wanted to be Elvis. ... But P.F. Sloan? He wanted honesty and truth.&quot;

During the Summer of Love, Sloan played as a solo artist on the first day (Saturday June 10, 1967) of the &quot;Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival&quot;. A famed celebration of pop music, on Mount Tamalpais, this seminal event occurred prior to the Monterey Pop Festival held the following weekend, although unlike the Monterey event no film or audio recordings were preserved and its history is much less known.

Sloan&#x27;s final Dunhill release was a solo single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help But Wonder, Elizabeth&quot; b/w &quot;Karma (A Study of Divinations)&quot;, once again released under the name Philip Sloan.

=== After Dunhill ===
After leaving Dunhill, Sloan recorded an album in 1968 titled &quot;Measure of Pleasure&quot;. It was produced by Tom Dowd and released by ATCO. In 1969, Sloan&#x27;s &quot;New Design&quot; was included on the &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love To Town&quot; album by Kenny Rogers and The First Edition. Sloan left the music scene due to numerous business and legal problems. He repeatedly reported that Dunhill made threatening advances to force him to sign away the rights to his valuable compositions and that the reason for his absence from the music scene was to battle illnesses. After 1969, he did not frequently record or perform until the new millennium. He finally found relief from his long illness with help from Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba. In 2006, describing this period away from the world, Sloan said, &quot;I was ill I guess for a good 20, maybe 25 years. ... Catatonia for a long time.&quot;

Sloan released only two albums during this period: &quot;Raised on Records&quot;, released on Mums Records in 1972 while he was recovering from illness, and &quot;Serenade of the Seven Sisters&quot;, released on Pioneer Records in Japan in the early 1990s, because Sloan&#x27;s &quot;From A Distance&quot; (from his second solo album) had been successful there. Positive response led to the Japanese album being released worldwide.

In 2005, Sloan made a series of recordings with producer Jon Tiven in Nashville, Tennessee. The resulting album, &quot;Sailover&quot;, was released in August 2006 on the Hightone Records label. &quot;Sailover&quot; was a veiled reference to the guru that helped him get well, proclaiming that Sloan was indeed a &quot;Sai Lover&quot;. Tiven played guitar on the record and his wife Sally played bass. The album was a mix of classic and new compositions, including several new songs co-written with Tiven. Guests included Frank Black, Buddy Miller, Lucinda Williams, Felix Cavaliere, Tom Petersson and Gary Tallent.

In 2014, Sloan&#x27;s final series of recordings appeared on his album titled &quot;My Beethoven&quot;. These recordings began when Sloan attended a concert in Los Angeles, featuring Beethoven compositions, that affected him deeply. He focused on fully understanding the similarities between the legendary composer and himself. This journey of discovery took him a full decade to complete. He learned to play and compose with a piano during the process. The work enabled him to heal the wounds that he encountered during the trials and tribulations of his life. This last musical project led to him forgiving his transgressors, leaving his anger behind him and moving forward with peace, love and serenity for the remainder of his life.

In 2015, Sloan published a book, co-written with S.E. Feinberg, entitled &quot;What&#x27;s Exactly the Matter with Me? Memoirs of a Life in Music&quot;.

=== Death ===
Sloan died on November 15, 2015, at his home in Los Angeles, aged 70. He had pancreatic cancer for several months and his death was attributed to that disease.

=== Reissues ===
Sloan&#x27;s early work has been poorly represented on compact disc, with only a smattering of releases to his name. &quot;Measure of Pleasure&quot; was reissued on CD by Collectors&#x27; Choice in January 2007. There is a collection of his demo recordings available (&quot;Child of Our Times&quot;, on the Varèse Sarabande), and there was a now-out-of-print 1993 collection of his Dunhill recordings (&quot;Anthology&quot;, on the One Way label).

In 2008, UK-based Big Beat label did a near-definitive reissue of Sloan&#x27;s solo recordings for Dunhill. Entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s Where I Belong: The Best of the Dunhill Years 1965–1967&quot;, the CD omits the album tracks &quot;When the Wind Changes&quot; and &quot;Patterns Seg. 4&quot;, while Sloan&#x27;s final Dunhill recording, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help But Wonder, Elizabeth&quot;, made its legal CD debut on this release.

== Eponymous song ==

&quot;P.F. Sloan&quot; is also a song by singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, who is better known for the 1960s hits &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;.

Cover versions of the song were recorded by The Association in 1971, Jennifer Warnes, and by British band &quot;Unicorn&quot; in the early 1970s – released as a single and album track on Transatlantic Records. Jackson Browne performed the song with Webb on Webb&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Just Across the River&quot;. In 2012 it was covered by the British singer Rumer, who treated it as the signature song on her &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; album.

While Sloan&#x27;s insistence on becoming a recording artist was an inspiration to fellow songwriter Webb, who had worked with Sloan with Bones Howe and The 5th Dimension, a personal dispute led Webb to deny the existence of &quot;P.F. Sloan&quot; when asked about the song&#x27;s title character during an article interview, saying that he had made the name up. Eugene Landy laid claim to being the real P.F. Sloan when he was asked by reporters why he considered himself able to direct Brian Wilson&#x27;s musical career. Landy claimed to have written the songs attributed to &quot;P.F. Sloan&quot;.
