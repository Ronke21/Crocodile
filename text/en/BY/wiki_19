<text>Wilton is a term archaeologists use to generalize archaeological sites and cultures that share similar stone and non-stone technology dating from 8,000-4,000 years ago. Archaeologists often refer to Wilton as a technocomplex (Archaeological culture), or Industry. Technological industries are defined by a common tradition of stone tool assemblages, but these technological industries extend to common cultural behaviors. As such, archaeologists use these industries to define a discrete cultural taxonomy. However, technological industries have the potential to generalize different cultures and communities at regional scales that, in more local settings, are distinguishable in both technology and cultural behaviors.

== History ==

Originally defined from archaeological assemblages recovered from Wilton rock shelter in 1921, archaeologists use Wilton to refer to stone age foraging and pastoral communities in portions of east Africa and throughout South Africa that are associated with small stone tools and an increase in the number of formal stone tools like scrappers and backed tools. Archaeological assemblages in Zambia contains evidence for non-stone technology that has led some archaeologists to hypothesize an increased importance of wooden tools Wilton tool sets.

Archaeologists initially recognized Wilton foraging communities from the Holocene beginning 8,000 years ago up through the Iron Age until 500 years ago, though recent studies separate &quot;Wilton&quot; from the &quot;final late Stone Age&quot; at 4,000 years ago. Despite Wilton as a term meant to generalize the behaviors of human populations, foraging communities that utilized Wilton-like technology and exhibited Wilton-like behaviors can be found in near-coastal, inland, and montane environments. These diverse landscapes contradict the specificity of Wilton culture that archaeologists had hoped to encompass with this term. In fact, archaeological deposits and isotopic data show that &quot;Wilton foragers&quot; used a wide range of technologies and exhibited diverse behaviors including diets, mobility, and exchange networks.

Early accounts of Wilton archaeological assemblages posit that similar technology equates to identical cultural identities, suggesting prehistoric communities represented a single culture that ranged from southernmost South Africa to as north as Zambia. Archaeologists characterize Wilton by a greater variety of stone tools and smaller, more formal, stone technology. Additional wooden and bone tools lead archaeologists to think that biological materials played an important role in communities that made Wilton technologies. This technology distinguishes Wilton technology from earlier technological industries such as the Oakhurst. Oakhurst technology dates from 12,000-8,000 years ago and is defined as a technological industry that contains few formal tools and large stone tools, especially large stone scrappers. Previous technological industries like the Oakhurst may have included biological tools like bone and wooden implements, but since biological remains do not survive in the archaeological record, archaeologists are not able to always use these biological tools to define technological industries. It is these changes in stone and non-stone technology that imply changes in cultural behaviors of foragers at these sites and thus, have caused some archaeologists to recognize Wilton technology as a single cultural entity.

Wilton is widely described as a shift from large to small stone technology with an emphasis on stone scrappers and backed tools, though not all sites associated with Wilton contain high numbers of backed tools. This discrepancy offers some evidence that broad categories like &quot;Wilton&quot; overgeneralize behaviors of people whom, though may have had some cultural activities in common, exhibit diverse tool sets. Many archaeologists acknowledge that Wilton is not a single culture or identity but, instead, solely reflects general trends over small regions in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Transvaal, and most of South Africa from 8,000-4,000 years ago.

=== Wilton rock shelter ===
Wilton technology was first described by John Hewitt after he excavated with the collaboration of C. W. Wilmot a cave on the farm Wilton near Alicedale in the eastern Cape of South Africa. Later sites are found along the coastal and the interior of South Africa and as north as the countries Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Wilton site is adjacent to the Karoo region of South Africa and represents a diverse environment that could have easily supported forager groups living in this area. Three dates came from the Wilton rock shelter that ranged from 8,260-2,270. This date range allowed archaeologists to track changes in the size and type of stone technology through the Wilton site and initially defined Wilton technology. The observed environment and time constraints at this site, among others like the Oakhurst site and Matjes River, provide archaeologists with insight into a time range in which foragers produced Wilton technology and thus, exhibited shared technological industries.

At the Wilton site, Hewitt first noted that this site contained remnants from two distinct cultures, distinguishable by the size of the stone tools. The stone preceding Wilton technology appeared much larger at the Wilton site. Based on the large size of the stone tools, Hewitt supposed that this material pertained to a predecessor of Wilton technology, known today as Oakhurst. The significant component of Wilton sites is decreased tool size compared with Oakhurst and an increase frequency of stone scrapers. Furthermore, the stone material at the Wilton rock shelter is predominantly Chalcedony. This assemblage was dominated by stone scrapers and few backed tools. Scrapers were likely used for processing animal hides. Backed tools were created by blunting one margin of the stone tool at a near-90 degree angle. These backed tools were likely hafted to projectiles and served as barbs. Archaeologists have used the assemblage at the Wilton rock shelter to define other Wilton-like assemblages throughout South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

=== Evolution of Wilton as a technological industry ===
In 1929, Goodwin and Van Riet Lowe initially used &quot;Wilton&quot; as a term to describe Microlith archaeological assemblages that contained small stone scrapers and backed tools. During this early period of excavation, Goodwin and Van Riet Lowe broke up Wilton technology into two variations defined by the interior and coastal geography of South Africa. The technological industry they associate with interior sites was termed &quot;Smithfield&quot;, leaving Wilton to define coastal foragers. Forager communities that used Smithfield technology were thought to be contemporaneous with Wilton but contained much larger stone technologies. During the mid-1900s, archaeologists began recovering more Wilton-like objects from other locations in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. The stone technology in each of these regions reflects similar characteristics of Wilton technology but each contained slight variations in the technology, likely reflecting local differences due to the variation between environments. For instance, the site of Gwisho in Zambia had predominantly more backed tools than scrapers, contradicting what was originally found at the Wilton rock shelter. Backed tools soon became a significant component of Wilton assemblages. Building on the increased frequency of Wilton sites, Deacon used radiocarbon dates and backed tool frequencies to show that &quot;Smithfield&quot; could not be contemporaneous with Wilton and thus, must be the preceding technological industry, now termed Oakhurst.

Today, Wilton technology covers much of the same geographical scale as the preceding industry, Oakhurst. Wilton was originally associated with the archaeological assemblage from Wilton farm, which included a high number of scrapers, though archaeological assemblages elsewhere showed additional evidence for backed technology. So, today, Wilton technology is associated with an increase in formal tools like scrapers and backed pieces as well as a significant reduction in size. Wilton technology represents an increase in homogeneity across much of South Africa, including some sites in Zambia and Zimbabwe. This pattern of standard, Wilton, tool kits breaks down after 4,000 years, entering into the final late stone age. Evidence for the introduction of ceramics, pastoralism, and ironworking post-dating 4,000 years ago has created a mosaic of final late stone age technological industries in Southern Africa. This mosaic of industries makes it difficult to make regional generalizations of technological industries like Wilton. So, the term Wilton is now limited from 8,000-4,000 years.

== Technology ==
Archaeologists associate Wilton assemblages with an assortment of different types of stone and non-stone technology. Stone materials are one of the longest-lasting artifacts and, as such, allow archaeologists to interpret the behaviors of past peoples. In rare instances, it is possible for archaeologists to recover non-stone technology, hereafter referred to as biological material. Biological materials like wooden shafts of spears or digging sticks give insight into the broader cultural pattern of past foraging communities that is usually only represented via stone materials. For the Wilton archaeological record, archaeologists have access to a wide variety of stone tools and cases where biological tools were recovered, allowing Wilton to be defined by not only stone but also non-stone technology.

=== Stone technology ===
Initially derived from the Wilton rock shelter in South Africa, Janette Deacon classified the Wilton assemblages into four phases that mark the beginning of Wilton (stage 0), a growth phase (stage 1), a mature phase (stage 2), and a decline phase (stage 3). Janette Deacon recognizes a pre-ancestral stone industry at Wilton rock shelter dating to 10,000 years ago by the presence of large stone scrapers made from Quartzite materials. Furthermore, these stone materials are associated with large fauna, suggesting pre-ancestral peoples foraged large animals. These large stone tools are attributable to what Goodwin and Lowe would term &quot;Smithfield&quot;, a contemporaneous but distinct culture from Wilton. At 8,000 years ago, scrapers at the Wilton site become much smaller, and very few tool types are represented at this time. Deacon claims that this forms the basis for a growth phase (stage 1) of Wilton, which turns towards a mature phase (stage 2) dating to around 4,800 years ago. Stage 2 is represented by the smallest variation in scraper size and shape as well as a faunal assemblage dominated by small animals, distinguishing the Wilton from its predecessor. Additionally, this period is correlated with an increase in backed tool manufacture at Wilton. Though Deacon does not bring attention to this increase, backed tools become a prevalent factor in Wilton assemblages with sites like Gwisho. Then, around 2,270 years ago, the stone scrapers at Wilton become more variable, and formal tools decrease, suggesting a decline phase (stage 3). Stage 3 at the Wilton site is also correlated with the occurrence of pottery. Deacon suggests that &quot;The correlation between the appearance of pottery and the &#x27;death&#x27; of the Wilton cultural system is perhaps significant.&quot; These observations at Wilton rock shelter formed the basis for how Wilton assemblages are colloquially recognized, but soon, archaeologists realized that Wilton assemblages do vary in technology depending on where they are located.

Where Goodwin and Lowe originally define &quot;Smithfield,&quot; now known as Oakhurst, as the interior cultural equivalent to Wilton, Deacon showed that Wilton is constrained to the middle-Holocene (~8,000-4,000 years ago) and excludes assemblages identified as Oakhurst. Specifically, the main difference between Oakhurst and Wilton is a decrease in tool size and an increase in formal tools. Moreover, Deacon showed that there is a correlation between Wilton assemblages and an increasing quantity of formal tools like small segments, backed tools, and scrapers. These stone implements are similar to previous stone technologies that show up in several archaeological assemblages dating back to the Howiesons Poort (~70,000 years ago). Stone segments are often geometric in shape forming crescents that are then &quot;backed&quot;. The process of &quot;backing&quot; involves repeated percussion against one edge of a stone tool at a nearly 90-degree angle. Archaeologists associate these backed tools and segments as inserts that would have been hafted to form spear-like weapons. Some archaeologists argue that the reoccurrence of standardized stone segments and backed tools reflect a similar adaptation to environmental stress including increasing populations and deteriorating climate.

In Zambia, the stone technology from Luano Spring contains similar components to South African Wilton assemblages. Zambian Wilton technology is defined from the Mumbwa site, which shares similar technologies to South African Wilton and dates to the same later stone age period (8,000-4,000 years ago). Stone technology from Luano Spring consists of mostly quartz materials and, like South Africa, reflects a shift towards decreased size and emphasis on formal tools. However, this site is unique because of the frequency of Denticulate tools. The prominence of these types of tools likely reflects regional adaptations to different environments and access to raw materials like quartz. Due to this variation, some have termed these assemblages in Zambia as Nachikufan. Others have further noted that not all Nachikufan assemblages in Zambia reflect a similar Wilton-like appearance and thus, question their role in the later stone age industries. The distinction between Wilton and Nachikufan is defined by the absence of large scrapers, which had defined the previous Oakhurst technologies.

Similar sites in Zambia like that of Gwisho contained both inorganic (stone) and organic tools. Stone technology at Gwisho was similarly made on quartz raw materials. The stone flakes from Gwisho were irregular and accompanied by Wilton-like formal tools such as small scrapers and backed tools, but this site also contained denticulate tools, though not as many as was recovered from Luano Spring. A comparison between Gwisho and Mumbwa shows that Gwisho varied by the frequency of &quot;heavy stone tools (defined as tools used for woodworking ) and Burins, showing local variations in Zambia assemblages.&quot; However, like South Africa, the similarity in decreased stone technology, emphasis on small scrapers, and backed tools suggests Wilton technology in Zambia appears homogenous across space during the later stone age.

=== Non-stone technology ===
Archaeological sites in Zimbabwe and Zambia provide evidence of worked bone and wooden implements, providing an insight into the organic tools associated with Wilton technology. Specifically, the site of Pomongwe in Zimbabwe as well as Gwisho and Amadzimba cave in Zambia provide an assortment of bone and wooden technologies. Pomongwe cave in Zimbabwe has preserved several wooden and bone tools dating around 2,000 years ago and assigned as a Wilton assemblage. Two large and four small wooden projectile points and an element shaped like a hook were recovered from Pomongwe in association with notched bone shards, which are likely the result of scraping motions. Cook suggests that the wooden tools may have been used as digging sticks to acquire food resources, whereas the hook-shaped element may have been used as an animal trap. There was one cylindrical bone element that was hollowed out and may have been used as a flute or smoking pipe. Together, these biological tools allow archaeologists to infer the hunting and social behaviors of foragers associated with Wilton technologies. Furthermore, Cook contrasts the similarity of these biological tools with those found in South Africa and Zambia, arguing that Wilton technologies are similarly designed across southern Africa.

Gwisho hot springs in Zambia are broken up into three discrete sites, Gwisho A, B, and C. The Gwisho sites in Zambia contain several crushed bone and elephant ivory that was likely used for bone marrow as well as evidence for use-wear, suggesting these objects fall under the category of technology. Examples of bone tools found at Gwisho include points, awls, and needles. These types of tools were also encountered at the Amadzimba Cave in Southern Rhodesia, though Fagan and Van Noten argue that the bone technology at Gwisho is not as &quot;advanced&quot; as those recovered from Southern Rhodesia. Other sites in Zambia like Mumbwa have not yielded any evidence for bone tools. This variation could be the result of clear differences in technologies that foragers used at these sites, or taphonomic biases. That is, since biological materials rarely survive in the archaeological record, sites that lack evidence of biological tools may simply reflect instances with poor preservation, instead of technological changes.

Wooden fragments found at Gwisho are another form of technological strategy that implies the importance of wood-as-tools at these sites. Many wooden tools at Gwisho Springs are fragmented and unidentifiable, but each one shows signs of chopping, smoothing, and cutting, implying the intentional working of these wooden implements. Fagan and Von Noten identify several types of wooden tools at the Gwisho sites that include Pointed implements, digging sticks, club-shaped objects, and an array of smoothed fragments. They interpret the implements as evidence for pestles, knives, arrow shafts, and armaments. Similar types of wooden fragments were recovered from the Pomongwe site in Zimbabwe. Since these wooden tools are associated with Wilton-like stone technology, this relationship provides evidence of the importance that biological tools played in communities that made Wilton-like stone tools. Biological tools do not preserve in every archaeological context and thus, provide one explanation for why other sites associated with Wilton do not exhibit evidence of biological tools.

== Cultural behavior ==
Archaeologists like Goodwin and Lowe first used the term Wilton to describe a distinct stone tool assemblage with the implication that these assemblages were associated with unique cultural behaviors of foraging communities. Though some archaeologists show that Wilton sites dating between 8,000 and 4,000 years ago share similar stone and non-stone technology, contrasts between sites like Gwisho Spring, Pomongwe, Mumbwa, Wilton rock shelter, and Rose Cottage Cave show variability in the tools that foragers used during the middle Holocene. Changes in frequency and types of tools present reflects the variability at each of these sites. These changes might be a result of different environmental adaptations, however, Wilton-like assemblages still reflect homogeneous shifts from large to small tools and thus, may suggest a changes in behavioral adaptation that may include different diets, social networks, and population changes.

=== Diet ===
Archaeologists use a variety of methods to understand the past diets of forager communities including the presence of faunal remains and isotope data. Diets of many Wilton sites have been interpreted through the presence of faunal material, while few sites along the Southern coast of South Africa interpret diets through isotopic data. Wilton sites located in the cape of South Africa are generally associated with the collection of small animals, differentiating the preceding phase in which Oakhurst assemblages are correlated with large animals. Plant use also appeared to increase during Wilton occupations until 2,000 years ago.

These trends of plant and animal use are also reflected in the South African interior at sites like Rose Cottage Cave. At this inland site, an analysis of the stone tools shows that plant processing was a common task that foragers practiced. Preserved starch grains suggest that people at Rose Cottage Cave likely harvested underground plants including bulbs and tubers. Specific animals that were consumed at this site include antelope, vlei rat, warthog, and springbok among many more species.

Northern Wilton assemblages also contain evidence for increased hunting of small game and heavy plant processing. In the Lunsemfwa basin, along the Lunsemfwa River in Zambia, the most dominant species present are bovids. Among the list of bovids represented here, past peoples consumed zebra, tortoise, aardvark, and small browsing antelope. In this region of Zambia, these fauna represent a similar environment that exists in Zambia today. Musonda and Gutin similarly show that the presence of fauna at the Mufulwe rock shelter in Zambia suggests periods of increased aridity that would have forced foraging communities to seasonally migrate between different sites on the landscape. This contrasts South African interior sites where the environment was less stable, yet both sites show similar animal and plant use patterns among the inhabitants.

Even along the southern coast of South Africa, despite the vicinity to the ocean, the faunal assemblages reflect terrestrial hunting strategies but with a slight increase in marine resources. Sites like Nelson Bay Cave show continued dependence on small game animals from 9,000-5,000 years ago. However, after 5,000 years ago diets at Nelson Bay Cave and other coastal sites reflect an increased dependence on marine resources. At Nelson bay cave 3,300 years ago, marine resources like fish and seals became a staple food source for these people. The site of Matjes River, which lies 14 km along the shore from Nelson Bay Cave shows a similar trend away from terrestrial foods but, instead of foraging marine resources, isotopic and archaeological data suggest the inhabitants of Matjes River had a mixed diet. This mixed diet included terrestrial bovids with an increased emphasis on the collection marine of foods like shellfish. Contrasting these two examples, skeletal remains from the inland site of Witcher&#x27;s Cave show an exclusive terrestrial diet. So, it is clear that, where other Wilton sites in South Africa and Zambia show a continued dependence on small bovids and plant processing through the middle Holocene, forager communities in the southernmost portion of South Africa along coastal environments reflect a variety of behaviors that diverge from the classic Wilton generalization after 4,000 years ago.

=== Material exchange ===

Since archaeologists recognize Wilton as a shared system of cultural behaviors, there is an implied relationship Wilton communities have with one another that span from southernmost South Africa to Zambia. However, archaeological evidence suggest inter-regional and intra-regional variation. For instance, the way in which past peoples made arrowheads and backed stone tools, suggests different methods of production and thus, limited communication between foraging communities associated with Wilton technology. Inter-regional variability can be seen between the Wilton rock shelter and sites like Zambia. At Wilton, there are few backed tools, something that, today, defines Wilton assemblages but in contrast, sites in Zambia exhibit a high number of backed tools. In contrast, some archaeologists suggest that the reduction in stone tool size is a practice that spread through large social networks. However, there is much more variety in the types of non-tool stone material remains including the use of shell beads and ochre. Shell beads are interpreted as materials that can be traded and represent group identities on the landscape. On the other hand, ocher has functional uses such as ultraviolet protection and mastic for binding stone tools to spear-like weaponry, however, many scholars have also argued that ochre was used to symbolize group identities like shell beads. Ochre was also recovered from burials that date to Wilton period, suggesting ceremonial importance for ochre. Though stone technology may have been exchanged on the southern African landscape, the presence of non-tool stone materials during the mid-Holocene does suggest a diverse array of behaviors.

Among inter-regional variations in technology, there exist intra-regional burial practices primarily located along coastal environments that vary widely in the material culture that accompanies burials. Hall and Binneman show increased emphasis in burial practices and material production from two South African sites, Klasies River Caves and Welgeluk Shelter. These authors show an increase in shell bead production that accompanies burials and suggest that this reflects a stressed environment and increased emphasis on group identity. These authors posit that such environments may drive increased social exchange between forager communities and further suggest this may indicate semi-permanent settlements. However, differences in shell materials and non-stone technology between Nelson Bay Cave and Matjes River, in South Africa, suggest limited material exchange. In this latter case, archaeologists interpret, not an increase in exchange networks, but evidence for exclusive behaviors associated with territorial defense.

To exemplify regional differences in Wilton communities, more recent studies of the Drakensberg montane region show large networks of forager communities. Stewart and colleagues use isotopes of strontium to show that ostrich eggshells traveled hundreds of kilometers into this region 8,000 years ago. This pattern contrasts that seen along the coastal regions where foragers are grounding themselves to specific parts of the landscape of South Africa, suggesting regional differences in mobility and potential for material exchange. For 50,000 years, forager communities in Africa have used ostrich eggshell beads. Archaeologists believe that the increase in bead production links prehistoric cultures to an increased need to symbolize group identities. The extensive movement of shells inland and the symbolic potential of these objects suggests highly mobile groups of people during the first period of time that we see Wilton-like technology (8,000 years ago). These networks once used to span from East to South Africa but appear to be disconnected after the Last Glacial Maximum. For instance, the stylistic design of eggshell beads remained similar between southern and eastern Africa until 33,000 years ago, forming an inter-regional network of foraging communities. By 19,000 years ago, the design of these beads varied, and by the middle Holocene, eastern and southern African communities appeared separated from one another. The spatial extent of social exchange was likely limited by prehistoric networks. The isolation of southern Africa may reflect the reason why Wilton-like technologies only extend as far north as Zimbabwe.

Lastly, the use of Ochre during this period has been interpreted as both, a symbolic and functional material. Ochre is a mineral pigment that past foraging communities have used since the Middle Stone Age for burials, symbolism, and hafting stone tools. During the Holocene, there is an increased use of ochre with evidence that ochre was heavily used in burials and hafting stone technology. Given that Wilton technology is associated with an increase in backed tools, it is likely that ochre was used for hafting these implements to create weapons. However, sites in southern Namaqualand, South Africa, exhibit an absence of preserved ochre on the backed tools in Holocene assemblages. This absence may suggest that ochre was used for other functional purposes during the Holocene and not exclusively for hafting stone tools. An additional use of ochre may be as an insect repellent and protection of UV light. By contrast, ochre may have been used as a social adaptation. For instance, the symbolic use of ochre could be related to signaling group identity and artistic expressions in the form of rock art. Most middle Holocene assemblages spanning from the coastal regions to inland montane environments do contain evidence that ochre was heavily used. However, the vast majority of archaeological assemblages in South Africa do not provide adequate context to directly observe the use of ochre as symbolic material. Archaeologists use ethnographic data to interpret how prehistoric populations may have used ochre and to infer the magnitude of its cultural significance.

=== Demographics ===
One implication of small, standard, stone tools that Wilton represents is related to the movement of peoples through southern Africa and hence, the interaction of different forager populations. Goodwin and Lowe initially considered Wilton to be a culture that migrated into South Africa from a more northern region, but Deacon showed that Wilton was likely an adopted feature of already existing technologies and was not an effect of a pioneering culture. Building on this hypothesis, Judith Sealy posits that Wilton technology was developed under low populations that occurred due to increased aridity throughout much of South Africa during the middle Holocene.

Current hypotheses suggest that the size of human populations is directly linked to changes in climate and hence, result in technological changes. Environmental data shows favorable climate and increased site density from 12,000-8,000 years ago, corresponding to Oakhurst technology, which consists of large, informal tools. Favorable climate fosters highly productive ecosystems and thus, adequate amount of resources to support large group sizes. Climate and demographics during this time implies large forager populations. However, during the middle Holocene, temperatures increased, forming arid regions that became unsuitable for forager populations in South Africa. Archaeological sites in South Africa show a discontinuous spatial distribution of Wilton technology and thus, suggests sparse populations. The use and emphasis on small, formal, stools from 8,000-4,000 years ago can be explained as a strategy for coping with poor environmental conditions. Yet, the uniform transition from large to small tools may suggest that there were extended networks between foraging communities in South Africa that extended north into portions of Zambia and Zimbabwe. This evidence provides support that ameliorated climate and sparse, but well-connected, foraging populations may be a component to the development of Wilton technology.

== Significance to modern African communities ==
Khoisan, sometimes just referred to as San, is the name for the Indigenous communities of South Africa and to many archaeologists, represents direct cultural descendants from later Stone Age foragers. At an early account for the site of Mumbwa in Zambia, Protsch argued that Khoisan peoples emerged in central Africa around 20,000 years ago. Other accounts by d&#x27;Errico and colleagues use evidence from Border Cave to suggest a much earlier emergence of Khoisan communities dating to 40,000 years ago. These case studies argue that the stone and non-stone tools of early foraging communities in central and southern Africa reflect similar tools used by Khoisan today, but other archaeologists argue on the basis of scientific inference that the similarity of technology does not imply cultural continuity over 40,000 years. These contrasting views reflect two main components of the &quot;Kalahari debate&quot; in which the question of cultural continuity between late Stone Age peoples and modern Indigenous communities comes under scrutiny. On one end, the cultural identities of African communities represent a direct link to prehistoric populations and can help to describe prehistoric behaviors. On the other end of this debate, cultural contact and transformation have been ongoing for thousands of years and so, modern communities do not reflect the exact cultural behaviors or identities of prehistoric populations.

During the Holocene, the question becomes whether Wilton technology reflects the foundation for modern Indigenous communities in South Africa today. Wilton is the last colloquially recognized technological industry before the final late Stone Age that post-dates 4,000 years. After 4,000 years ago, the technologies that foragers use become less standardized and more variable across Southern Africa. Increased variability in the types of tools people made may reflect human choices to specialize to specific environments and may signal a disconnect from exchange networks that some posit existed from 8,000-4,000 years. At 2,000 years ago, pastoral communities entered South Africa from northern regions and began to interact with foraging communities. Contact between foraging and pastoral communities likely impacted the types of tools present and cultural behaviors. Some scholars show that not all foraging communities conformed to pastoral lifeways, but, instead, adapted to the presence of pastoralists by specializing in tools designed for a new economy. A change in economy after 2,000 years may not have changed cultural practices of foragers during this time, but the introduction of this economy did change the kinds of stone technology. Therefore, this brings up an issue with connecting present and past cultural identities based solely on technology.

During European contact, other scholars posit that this interaction created a kind of Creolization. Creolization refers to the expression of new cultural traits as an effect of the contact between two unique cultures. Evidence for creolization in the historic past raises questions about whether cultural identities remained intact up until the present day. If cultural identities are intact, then archaeologists can use modern Indigenous communities to interpret Holocene behaviors, but the creolization may suggest a shift in cultural behaviors. This raises an additional question about what the difference between stone tools and cultural behaviors. In the instance where foragers in South Africa increased the production of stone scrapers as a result of changing economies with pastoral communities, does this reflect a change in cultural behavior or material production? Furthermore, since tools may be driven by changes in the economy and not necessarily cultural behaviors, this makes it difficult to argue that cultural identities are directly linked to stone technology. This brings us back to the concerns that stone industries like Wilton overgeneralize cultural behaviors and may not accurately reflect groups identities across southern Africa.

<doc id="697366" wikidata="Q3051587" url="?curid=697366" title="Mega Man &amp; Bass">
<text>is a 1998 action-platform game developed and published by Capcom. It is a spin-off game in the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series and was originally released in Japan for the Super Famicom on April 24, 1998. It was later ported to the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld in 2002, and localized in English and released the following year.

After defeating the evil Dr. Wily many times, the robotic hero Mega Man is called into action once again when a powerful being known as King steals the blueprints to the creations of Dr. Wily and Dr. Light in order to create an army for robotic dominance over humans. Having learned of the threat, Mega Man&#x27;s rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons. &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.

&quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; debuted on the aging 16-bit Super Famicom despite the series having already transitioned to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn with &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;. Producer Keiji Inafune claimed &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; was created with regard to younger players who didn&#x27;t yet own one of the more advanced gaming systems. The game received positive remarks from critics for its graphics and use of a tried-and-true gameplay formula, though many found the difficulty to be too steep. Although &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; shares many traits with previous console games in the series, &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be released up until 2008.

==Plot==
The story of &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; varies extremely depending on which player character is chosen. It begins one year after the events of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily&#x27;s laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man&#x27;s rival and Wily&#x27;s greatest creation), being kicked out of Wily&#x27;s laboratory due to the events, hears of the new criminal&#x27;s appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him, he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data, instructing his minions to handle the heroes. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King&#x27;s plans.

After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King&#x27;s shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King, who teleported Proto Man out of his castle after the battle. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his &quot;brainwashing level&quot; and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.

Mega Man and Bass confront Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass&#x27; abilities. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Bass doesn&#x27;t care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were to meet in the future.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; is similar to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action-platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the &quot;Robot Master&quot; boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon. In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double-jump (jump a second time in mid-air) and dash along the ground (similar to X in &quot;Mega Man X&quot;). Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash-jump.

The stage structure is much different from other games in the series. After the introduction level, the player can only choose between three Robot Masters. Defeating Cold Man unlocks Burner Man and Pirate Man; defeating Astro Man unlocks Dynamo Man, Tengu Man, and Pirate Man, and defeating Ground Man unlocks Magic Man and Tengu Man. Clearing one of these unlocked stages opens the way to a security room where the player must destroy a series of crystals with obtained Robot Master weapons. Bypassing all eight crystals opens the way to the fortress stages. In a similar fashion to previous installments in the series, enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed, and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades. However, unlike in &quot;Mega Man 7&quot; the security cavern offers a way to obtain large amounts of bolts without having to repeatedly visit stages. Some upgrades are unique to either character, such as Mega Man&#x27;s ability to call on his dog Rush to search for items, or an adaptor for Bass to combine with his wolf Treble to temporarily fly. Also distributed throughout the introduction and Robot Master levels are a collection of 100 data CDs that contain information on many prominent characters in the series. Most of the CDs are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character-specific ability, making it impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough. CDs collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game. Saved games are used in place of the series&#x27; traditional password system.

==Development==
&quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; was developed for the Super Famicom after the release of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;, which preceded &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; on the two 32-bit consoles, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. According to series producer Keiji Inafune, &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; was intended for younger players who still owned a Super Famicom and did not have the means to experience &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; on one of the newer systems. &quot;Even though trying to bridge out a new title on the [Super Famicom] was a little backwards at the time, we didn&#x27;t want to make a half-hearted attempt at it,&quot; Inafune explained. The design team included several new employees, as well as members of previous &quot;Mega Man&quot; games. Inafune required them to make the game &quot;as hardcore as possible&quot;. Designer Hideki Ishikawa recalled the development of &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; as &quot;one big party&quot;. The staff attempted to create an original game while avoiding the &quot;same old, same old [...] pitfall&quot; that so many long video game series suffer and &quot;had a lot of fun doing it&quot;.

Graphically, &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; uses many of the same two-dimensional sprites and animations as &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;. Two of the eight Robot Master bosses in &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; (Tengu Man and Astro Man) are borrowed from &quot;Mega Man 8&quot;. The other six were newly created for the game by three character designers: Hitoshi Ariga (credited as &quot;H. Ariga&quot;), Yoshihiro Iwamoto (credited as &quot;Y. Iwamoto&quot;) and Koji Izuki (credited as &quot;K. Iduki&quot;) designed two characters each. The bosses were officially unveiled on a teaser page in the Kodansha magazine &quot;Comic BonBon&quot;. Each boss was given distinct characteristics so that they could be easily identified by players in both their aesthetics and personalities. Some of these characters had different names during their conceptual phase prior to the finalization of the game. &quot;Blast Man&quot; became Burner Man, &quot;Freezer Man&quot; became Cold Man, and &quot;Coil Man&quot; became Dynamo Man. Iwamoto originally denoted Ground Man as &quot;Drill Man&quot; despite there already being a Robot Master by that name in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;. The musical score for &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; was composed by Akari Kaida (credited as &quot;A. Kaida&quot;), Naoshi Mizuta (credited as &quot;N. Mizuta&quot;), and &quot;Kirikiri-chan&quot; (Toshihiko Horiyama). Rather than create tracks together, each composer was responsible for their own songs.

Until its GBA re-release, it was one of the few &quot;Mega Man&quot; titles not localized for English-speaking countries. The company commemorated the 15th anniversary of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise with the GBA version of the game.

==Reception and legacy==

The GBA port has received generally positive critical reviews, currently holding an aggregate score of 79% on both GameRankings and Metacritic. Most critics found the game to be a solid yet conventional action-platformer that successfully adheres to the classic &quot;Mega Man&quot; formula. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; summarized that &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; is &quot;one of the best action games on GBA&quot; and &quot;a great, if slightly derivative, platformer&quot; with plenty of replay value due to the collectible CDs. &quot;GamePro&quot; was pleased with the game&#x27;s fidelity to its predecessors when compared to the deviations made by the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; and &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series on the same system. GameSpy contrarily criticized its lack of innovation, declaring, &quot;Anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried a &quot;Mega Man&quot; game yet would be better advised to spend $15 on a new copy of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; on the PSOne rather than paying $30 for an inferior retread of the same game&quot;.

Many reviews also noted the game&#x27;s high difficulty. Both Giancarlo Varanini of GameSpot and Craig Harris of IGN found that the game&#x27;s bosses have very unpredictable attack patterns, thus making the battles extremely challenging. Harris additionally observed a heavy amount of trial-and-error for the levels themselves where the player must die several times before completing each one. He concluded, &quot;[...] It&#x27;s really the way &quot;Mega Man&quot; games have always been... and to be honest, with all of the annoying little deaths in the game, there&#x27;s always that sensation after every failure that you&#x27;ve learned the challenge, and perseverance definitely prevails in this game&quot;.

According to &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; for the GBA sold 91,097 copies in Japan between its release date and the week of December 23, 2002. A related game exclusive to Japan titled was released for the WonderSwan handheld in 1999. The plot consists of the titular duo&#x27;s struggle against an adversary named &quot;Rockman Shadow&quot;. As &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; was released directly after &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; and it shares plot and gameplay characteristics with the rest of the numbered titles in the series, many believed it to be the ninth main game in the series; however, the actual &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; would not be released until 2008. Inafune explained in an interview with the Brazilian magazine &quot;Nintendo World&quot; that the ninth installment follows the storyline of &quot;Mega Man 8&quot; and that the worlds for &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; and &quot;Mega Man 9&quot; are meant to coincide with one another, as evidenced by a schematic of Bass in the ending of the game. In 2010, Bass was made playable via downloadable content in &quot;Mega Man 10&quot;. As in &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot;, he is able to dash, fire in seven directions with his buster, and fly by combining with Treble. 

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed &quot;Mega Man &amp; Bass&quot; as the 14th best GBA game of all time in its 20th anniversary issue in 2008.

<text>Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body. The &quot;formula&quot; in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform. Each year, the F1 World Championship season is held. It consists of a series of races, known as , held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. Drivers are awarded points based on their finishing position in each race, and the driver who accumulates the most points over each championship is crowned that year&#x27;s World Drivers&#x27; Champion. As of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, there have been 778 Formula One drivers from 41 different nationalities who have started at least one of the 1,125 FIA World Championship races since the first such event, the .

Seven-time champions Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton hold the record for the most championships. Hamilton also holds the record for the most wins with , the most pole positions with , the most points with , and the most podiums with . Fernando Alonso has entered more than anyone else () and also holds the record for the most Grand Prix starts (). The United Kingdom is the most represented country, having produced 163 drivers. Ten countries have been represented by just one. China became the latest country to be represented by a driver when Zhou Guanyu made his Formula One debut at the driving for Alfa Romeo. The most recent driver to make their Formula One debut is Jack Doohan, who debuted at the .

<text>The Sangoan is the name given by archaeologists to a Palaeolithic tool manufacturing style which may have developed from the earlier Acheulian types. In addition to the Acheulian stone tools, bone and antler picks were also used. Sangoan toolkits were used especially for grubbing.

As originally proposed, the Sangoan period was broadly analogous to the Mousterian culture in Europe and was dated to about 130 to 10 thousand years (kya). This was misleading because the Mousterian culture was predominantly made by Neanderthals, not by modern humans as in Africa. Dating was complicated by the lack of stratified deposits even after newer dating methods became available since 1980. Some sites have become available that indicate the Sangoan industry was produced before 250 kya, perhaps substantially earlier. It continues to be considered transitional between the African early Stone Age and middle Stone Age, but the MSA transition is now considered to have begun 500-350 kya.

It is named after the site of Sango Bay in Uganda where it was first discerned in 1920. Although Desmond Clark considered the complex to be tied to the tropical forest, the peoples who used Sangoan tools were hunting and gathering cultures, also known as the Sangoan, occupied southern Africa in areas where annual rainfall now is less than and Central African areas whose rainfall is above 2000 mm from the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic period. 
The Sangoan industry was distributed broadly from present day Botswana to Ethiopia and from Uganda to Angola and Gabon. In the Kalahari Desert, many prehistoric stone tools have been recovered by archaeologists dating at least as early as the period of the Sangoan culture. It also went as far north as the forested regions of the Congo. Confusion exists within literature as to what to call this early percussion-made bifacial complex, with certain writers stating the term Lupemban, or the term Sangoan.

Confusion exists as to how to define the Sangoan. Dating is not refined enough to clarify the climate conditions at the time the tools were deposited in the various sites. The Lupemban industry has been found in similar environments and may be more closely associated with forests. The technical details of the differences between the two are not clear. Both are associated with prepared cores typical of the middle Stone Age. The Lupemban industry is usually associated with more frequent long lance-like or leaf shaped, biface points (finished on both sides). The early versions are both are made with percussion knapping. The name Lupemban is applied to certain biface points made more recently, possibly in the late Pleistocene, in which indirect and direct pressure flaking is observed, but these techniques are not characteristics which separate the early Lupemban and Sangoan.

<doc id="697387" wikidata="Q1238408" url="?curid=697387" title="Granular convection">
<text>Granular convection is a phenomenon where granular material subjected to shaking or vibration will exhibit circulation patterns similar to types of fluid convection. It is sometimes called the Brazil nut effect, when the largest of irregularly shaped particles end up on the surface of a granular material containing a mixture of variously sized objects. This name derives from the example of a typical container of mixed nuts, in which the largest will be Brazil nuts. The phenomenon is also known as the muesli effect since it is seen in packets of breakfast cereal containing particles of different sizes but similar density, such as muesli mix.

Under experimental conditions, granular convection of variously sized particles has been observed forming convection cells similar to fluid motion.

==Explanation==

It may be counterintuitive to find that the largest and (presumably) heaviest particles rise to the top, but several explanations are possible:
* When the objects are irregularly shaped, random motion causes some oblong items to occasionally turn in a vertical orientation. The vertical orientation allows smaller items to fall beneath the larger item. If subsequent motion causes the larger item to re-orient horizontally, then it will remain at the top of the mixture.
* The center of mass of the whole system (containing the mixed nuts) in an arbitrary state is not optimally low; it has the tendency to be higher due to there being more empty space around the larger Brazil nuts than around smaller nuts. When the nuts are shaken, the system has the tendency to move to a lower energy state, which means moving the center of mass down by moving the smaller nuts down and thereby the Brazil nuts up.
* Including the effects of air in spaces between particles, larger particles may become buoyant or sink. Smaller particles can fall into the spaces underneath a larger particle after each shake. Over time, the larger particle rises in the mixture. (According to Heinrich Jaeger, &quot;[this] explanation for size separation might work in situations in which there is no granular convection, for example for containers with completely frictionless side walls or deep below the surface of tall containers (where convection is strongly suppressed). On the other hand, when friction with the side walls or other mechanisms set up a convection roll pattern inside the vibrated container, we found that the convective motion immediately takes over as the dominant mechanism for size separation.&quot;)
* The same explanation without buoyancy or center of mass arguments: As a larger particle moves upward, any motion of smaller particles into the spaces underneath blocks the larger particle from settling back in its previous position. Repetitive motion results in more smaller particles slipping beneath larger particles. A greater density of the larger particles has no effect on this process. Shaking is not necessary; any process which raises particles and then lets them settle would have this effect. The process of raising the particles imparts potential energy into the system. The result of all the particles settling in a different order may be an increase in the potential energy—a raising of the center of mass.
* When shaken, the particles move in vibration-induced convection flow; individual particles move up through the middle, across the surface, and down the sides. If a large particle is involved, it will be moved up to the top by convection flow. Once at the top, the large particle will stay there because the convection currents are too narrow to sweep it down along the wall.
* The pore size distribution of a random packing of hard spheres with various sizes makes that smaller spheres have larger probability to move downwards by gravitation than larger spheres.

The phenomenon is related to Parrondo&#x27;s paradox in as much as the Brazil nuts move to the top of the mixed nuts against the gravitational gradient when subjected to random shaking.

== Study techniques ==
Granular convection has been probed by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where convection rolls similar to those in fluids (Bénard cells) can be visualized.

Other studies have used time-lapse CT scans, refractive index matched fluids, and positron emission tracing. On the lower-tech end of the scale, researchers have also used thin, clear plastic boxes, so that the motion of some objects is directly visible.

The effect has been observed in even tiny particles driven only by brownian motion with no external energy input.

==Applications==

===Manufacturing===
The effect is of interest to food manufacturing and similar operations. Once a homogeneous mixture of granular materials has been produced, it is usually undesirable for the different particle types to segregate. Several factors determine the severity of the Brazil nut effect, including the sizes and densities of the particles, the pressure of any gas between the particles, and the shape of the container. A rectangular box (such as a box of breakfast cereal) or cylinder (such as a can of nuts) works well to favour the effect, while a container with outwardly slanting walls (such as in a conical or spherical geometry) results in what is known as the reverse Brazil nut effect.

===Astronomy===
In astronomy, it is common in low density, or rubble pile asteroids, for example the asteroid 25143 Itokawa and 101955 Bennu.

===Geology===
In geology, the effect is common in formerly glaciated areas such as New England and areas in regions of permafrost where the landscape is shaped into hummocks by frost heave — new stones appear in the fields every year from deeper underground. Horace Greeley noted &quot;Picking stones is a never-ending labor on one of those New England farms. Pick as closely as you may, the next plowing turns up a fresh eruption of boulders and pebbles, from the size of a hickory nut to that of a tea-kettle.&quot; A hint to the cause appears in his further description that &quot;this work is mainly to be done in March or April, when the earth is saturated with ice-cold water&quot;. Underground water freezes, lifting all particles above it. As the water starts to melt, smaller particles can settle into the opening spaces while larger particles are still raised. By the time ice no longer supports the larger rocks, they are at least partially supported by the smaller particles that slipped below them. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles in a single year speeds up the process.

This phenomenon is one of the causes of inverse grading which can be observed in many situations including soil liquefaction during earthquakes or mudslides. Liquefaction is a general phenomenon where a mixture of fluid and granular material subjected to vibration ultimately leads to circulation patterns similar to both fluid convection and granular convection. Indeed, liquefaction is fluid-granular convection with circulation patterns which are known as sand boils or sand volcanoes in the study of soil liquefaction. Granular convection is also exemplified by debris flow, which is a fast moving, liquefied landslide of unconsolidated, saturated debris that looks like flowing concrete. These flows can carry material ranging in size from clay to boulders, including woody debris such as logs and tree stumps. Flows can be triggered by intense rainfall, glacial melt, or a combination of the two.

<text>The Nicholson Museum was an archaeological museum at the University of Sydney home to the Nicholson Collection, the largest collection of antiquities in both Australia and the Southern Hemisphere. Founded in 1860, the collection spans the ancient world with primary collection areas including ancient Egypt, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, and the Near East. The museum closed permanently in February 2020, and the Nicholson Collection is now housed in the Chau Chak Wing Museum at the University of Sydney, open from November 2020. The museum was located in the main quadrangle of the University.

== Introduction ==

The Nicholson Museum was named after its founder, Sir Charles Nicholson. In 1856-57, Nicholson traveled throughout Egypt and then Italy where he acquired the first thousand or so primarily ancient Egyptian, Greek, South Italian and Etruscan artefacts. These he donated to the University in 1860. The museum&#x27;s collection grew exponentially since this founding donation. Individual benefaction, donations, sponsored archaeological 
projects and curatorial acquisition have all contributed to the wealth of material in the Nicholson Collection.

The museum had a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibition areas within its gallery. Permanent or ongoing exhibitions included: Egyptians, Gods and Mummies: Travels with Herodotus, Aphrodite&#x27;s Island: Australian Archaeologists in Cyprus; The Etruscans: A Classical Fantasy; Tombs, Tells and Temples: Excavating the Near East as well as a permanent display of artefacts from the Greek and Italian Classical world. Temporary exhibitions included: LEGO Pompeii, featuring a large scale model of the site of Pompeii in LEGO and 50 Objects, 50 Stories – which was moved to Chau Chak Wing Museum upon the closing of Nicholson.

The Nicholson Museum, along with its sister institutions, the Macleay Museum and the University Art Gallery, were united under a single director, David Ellis, in 2003 to form Sydney University Museums. In 2005, Michael Turner was appointed Senior Curator.

== Permanent collections ==
The permanent collections of the Nicholson Museum spanned the ancient world with primary collection areas including the Classical world of Greece and Italy, Egypt, Cyprus, the Near East and Northern Europe from the Neolithic to Medieval periods. The Collection also includes a significant historic photograph collection of over 1,350 glass negatives taken by former curator William J. Woodhouse.

===Egyptian collection===
The ancient Egyptian collection included artefacts from a variety of ancient sites including Abydos, Alexandria, Bubastis, Fayum, Heliopolis, Memphis, Saqqara, and Thebes. Egyptian material formed a large part of Sir Charles Nicholson&#x27;s founding donation. He traveled throughout Egypt between 1856 and 1857 purchasing artefacts from dealers in Cairo and Luxor as well as collecting artefacts straight from sites, including Karnak where he collected a fragment of a red granite thought to be from Hatshepsut&#x27;s obelisk.

===Cypriot collection===
Beginning in 1860 with a single artefact from the original donation by Sir Charles Nicholson, the collection grew exponentially, especially under the curatorial direction of firstly William Woodhouse (honorary curator 1903-1938) and then James Stewart (honorary curator 1954-1962). Many of the artefacts within the collection were sourced directly from Stewart&#x27;s own excavations conducted at Bellapais Vounous, Karmi Palealona, Karmi Lapasta, Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi and Vasilia Kafkallia as well as from the excavations of at the sites of Myrtou Stephania and Myrtou Sphagion, conducted by Stewart&#x27;s former student Basil Hennessy, who later became Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology at the University of Sydney. As a result of these acquisitions, the Museum held many complete tomb groups of archaeological importance.

===Greek collection===
The Nicholson Collection&#x27;s Greek collections contains artefacts representative of the material culture of the Greek mainland, islands and surrounding regions, from the Bronze Age through to the Late Hellenistic period. During Sir Charles Nicholson&#x27;s travels to Egypt and Europe between 1856 and 1858 he acquired, primarily in Rome, a range of Classical and Hellenistic Greek ceramics as well as terracotta figurines. In total over seventy significant Greek artefacts were included in the founding donation of the Nicholson Museum. Further material, representative of the Greek mainland and islands, was bought during the curatorship of A. D. Trendall. His proactive acquisition program involved purchasing a wide range of ceramic types of Greek origin as well as significant contributions of sherd material for teaching purposes sought from prominent museums and individual collectors and scholars, including Sir John Beazley. The collection was then expanded following a donation of hundreds of pottery fragments and small votive objects by the family of former curator William J Woodhouse in 1948. The majority of this material is thought to have been collected during Woodhouse&#x27;s 1890s and 1930s trips to Greece, documented in the Woodhouse photographic collection.

===Italian collection===
The Italian collection is representative of the diversity of the ancient Italian world with significant cultural material from Etruria, South Italy and the Roman World. From the museum&#x27;s foundation the cultures of ancient Italy have been strongly represented in the collection. Sir Charles Nicholson spent considerable time in Rome collecting Latin inscriptions, Etruscan funerary urns and bronzes, South Italian vases and Roman lamps, figurines and ceramics. Additional large sculptural works were also acquired by Sir Charles including two life-sized togatus statues along with several fragmentary figures. The Italian collection was further developed with the acquisition of a significant corpus of South Italian vases by A.D. Trendall during his curatorial tenure. Many of the significant pieces from the South Italian collection were comprehensively published in the first &quot;Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum&quot; of an Australian collection.

===Near Eastern collection===
The Nicholson Museum&#x27;s collection of Near Eastern artefacts represented many of the great cities and civilisations that flourished along the Levantine coast, across Mesopotamia and through to Pakistan and India. The Near Eastern collection began with just a handful of artefacts from Ur, donated by the British Museum in 1926. This was greatly expanded upon in the mid 20th century by the acquisition program of the curators A.D. Trendall and his successor James Stewart. Both curators wrote countless letters to museums and government agencies around the world requesting representative samples of artefacts to ensure the Nicholson Museum&#x27;s holdings reflected the diversity of this expansive region. The University of Sydney also contributed financially to archaeological excavations and projects in the Near East, most notably Dame Kathleen Kenyon’s excavations at Jericho. In return for the University&#x27;s support the Nicholson Museum received a consignment of objects at the end of each season including full tomb groups from the Bronze Age and rare finds such as our Neolithic over plastered skull. Other items have been acquired through generous donations of individual archaeologists, including Sir Leonard Woolley and Sir Flinders Petrie, as well as from archaeological institutes, museums and private donors.

==Temporary exhibitions==
===LEGO Pompeii===

A modern display of Pompeii built with LEGO was featured in Nicholson museum. Professional LEGO builder Ryan McNaught assembled the work. The display showed Pompeii as it was the moment of destruction, as it was when rediscovered, and as it is today. The exhibit appears to be an attempt to appeal to contemporary audiences, and especially a younger generation, including current HSC ancient history students, as Pompeii is an early part of the curriculum taught. Upon seeing the exhibit it is apparent that a lot of work has gone into it (around 470 hours). The deep red glow – only noticeable from the rear of the piece – foreshadows the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed the town. The exhibit attracted new audiences to Nicholson Museum.

<doc id="697394" wikidata="Q5758074" url="?curid=697394" title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">
<text>The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) was a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom, which was responsible for the distribution of funding for higher education to universities and further education colleges in England since 1992. It ceased to exist as of 1 April 2018, when its duties were divided between the newly created Office for Students and Research England (operating within United Kingdom Research and Innovation).

Most universities are charities and HEFCE (rather than the Charity Commission for England and Wales) was their principal regulator. HEFCE therefore had the duty to promote compliance with charity law by the universities for which it was responsible.

==History==
HEFCE was created by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 (which also created the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), replaced in 2001 by the Learning and Skills Council).

On 1 June 2010 HEFCE became the principal regulator of those higher education institutions in England that are &#x27;exempt charities&#x27;. This followed the Charities Act 2006, according to which all charities should be subject to regulation.

The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 directed that HEFCE should be replaced by a new body, the Office for Students, also incorporating the Office for Fair Access (OFFA), but with HEFCE&#x27;s research funding functions reassigned to UK Research and Innovation.

===Chief Executives===
* Prof Madeleine Atkins (2014–2018)
* Sir Alan Langlands (2009–2013)
* Prof David Eastwood (2006–2009)
* Sir Howard Newby (2001–2006)
* Sir Brian Fender (1995–2001)
* Sir Graeme Davies (1992–1995)

==Structure==
HEFCE staff worked within six directorates. Leadership for these key strategic areas was shared between the Chief Executive and directors.

===Management===
The chief executive of HEFCE was Professor Madeleine Atkins (since 1 January 2014), previously Vice-Chancellor of the University of Coventry. Her predecessor, Sir Alan Langlands, was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds.

==Function==
In 2017–2018 HEFCE allocated £3.5 billion in public funds from the UK Government to universities and colleges in England to &#x27;invest on behalf of students and the public to promote excellence and innovation in research, teaching and knowledge exchange&#x27;. It only funds the institutions and does not give grants or loans to individual students. It also helps develop and implement higher education policy, based on research and consultation.

===Charity regulation===
HEFCE was the legal &#x27;principal regulator&#x27; for the many UK universities and colleges who are classed as exempt charities. HEFCE described its role as &#x27;to promote compliance by charity trustees with their legal obligations in exercising control and management of the administration of the charity&#x27; and has a memorandum of understanding with the Charity Commission that details how the two will work together.

===Industry-academia links===
In addition to distributing both teaching and research funding to higher education institutions HEFCE was also involved with: widening participation; developing links between higher education institutions and business and the community; and enhancing leadership, governance and management within the sector. It provided both a contribution to core funding, and ring-fenced funding for special initiatives, projects and strategic aims.

===Prevent duty===
The Government delegated to HEFCE the responsibility for overseeing the Prevent duty, which obliged relevant higher education bodies to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. HEFCE monitored whether these bodies were carrying out the duty effectively, and reports findings back to providers and the Government on a regular basis.

===Register of Higher Education Providers===
HEFCE administered the Register of Higher Education Providers, a searchable tool that shows how the Government regulates higher education providers in England. This is primarily a regulatory tool, which lists each provider&#x27;s names and addresses, its powers and the standards it is required to meet, among other information useful to other regulators and Government agencies.

===Unistats===
HEFCE also owned the Unistats website which includes the student satisfaction ratings for different universities and subjects. These satisfaction ratings are compiled from the National Student Survey, and the feedback from students is held within the Unistats website and allows students to compare subjects, universities and UCAS points, see satisfaction ratings from other students and see what the employment prospects are for graduate jobs by subject chosen.

==Teaching initiatives==

===Higher Education Academy===
The Higher Education Academy (HEA), founded in May 2004, is funded by the UK HE Funding Councils (including HEFCE) and institutional subscriptions. It was established as the result of a merger of the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILTHE), the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), and the TQEF National Co-ordination Team (NCT).

===National Teaching Fellowship Scheme===
HEFCE also funded a National Teaching Fellowship (NTF) scheme for those working in England and Northern Ireland. The initiative is administered by the HEA and has two separate strands providing individual awards – recognising individual excellence in teaching within the Higher Education sector – and awards for large-scale projects typically undertaken by Higher Education institutions over periods of up to three years.

===Discontinued initiatives===
* The Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning initiative aimed to reward and invest in excellent teaching practice. It was HEFCE&#x27;s largest ever single funding initiative in teaching and learning, providing £350 million to 74 centres over a five-year period.
* The Higher Education Innovation Fund. 
* The Fund for the Development of Teaching and Learning was established to stimulate good teaching and learning practice in Higher Education. Over 164 projects were given awards.
* The Teaching and Learning Research Programme aimed to promote excellent educational research designed to enhance learning.
* The Online Learning Task Force aimed to maintain and develop the position of UK higher education as a world leader in online learning.

==Criticism==
The journal &quot;Nanotechnology Perceptions&quot; expressed doubt about the ability of HEFCE to effectively regulate the universities for which it was responsible, suggesting that while it would have the power to impose financial penalties on universities engaging in dishonest practice, there was no indication that it was prepared to do so.

<doc id="697395" wikidata="Q255711" url="?curid=697395" title="Wizard's First Rule">
<text>Wizard&#x27;s First Rule, written by Terry Goodkind, is the first book in the epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot;. Published by Tor Books, it was released on August 15, 1994 in hardcover, and in mass market paperback in September 1995. The book was also re-released with new cover artwork by Keith Parkinson in paperback on June 23, 2001. The novel was adapted to television in the 2008 television series &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;.

Goodkind had no trouble selling his first book to a publisher. &quot;I&#x27;m sort of the exception that proves the rule,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to be represented by the best agent in the country and I wrote him a letter.&quot; He asked to see the book and he liked it.&quot; He showed it to a number of publishers. Three of them had an auction. Ten weeks after I&#x27;d written &#x27;The End&#x27; it sold for a record price ($275,000),&quot; the most money ever paid for a fantasy novel by a first time author.

==Plot summary==

Richard Cypher, a young woods guide, lives in an area of the world known as Westland, which is one of three parts of the known world, divided by magical underworld boundaries. Of the three, Westland is united under one government and contains no magic, the Midlands are a coalition of sovereign nations with magic, and past another magical boundary lies the empire of D&#x27;Hara - a single kingdom ruled by Wizards.

After the unexplained murder of his father, Richard investigates. He discovers a piece of vine in his father&#x27;s house, and searches the mountains for a live part of the plant, thinking it might lead him to the murderers. He finds the plant, but it attacks him, implanting a poisonous thorn. While returning to town to find a healer, he finds a woman named Kahlan Amnell, who is being hunted by a group of assassins. Richard helps save Kahlan from the men, and learns that Kahlan is searching for the First Wizard, who is rumored to have crossed into Westland after the creation of the boundaries. Richard takes Kahlan to his best friend and mentor, Zedd. Soon after arriving, Richard collapses from the illness caused by the vine.

When Richard recovers under Zedd&#x27;s care, he identifies Zedd as the First Wizard. Kahlan pleads for Zedd&#x27;s help, asking for him to name a Seeker of Truth to confront Darken Rahl, the ruler of D&#x27;Hara. Rahl has activated the magical &quot;Boxes of Orden,&quot; which, depending how they are opened, could make Rahl ruler of the world, destroy all life, or destroy himself. Kahlan believes that the &quot;Seeker&quot; empowered by the Sword of Truth—a magical weapon forged by the powerful wizards of old—can stop Rahl before the magic expires on the winter solstice. Zedd tests Richard, to see if he is worthy of wielding the Sword of Truth. Richard passes the test, becoming the next ”Seeker.”

Richard deduces a way to cross the boundary as a group, and with the help of a friend, the boundary warden Chase, Richard, Kahlan and Zedd travel south towards a pass in the boundary. They encounter underworldly creatures which are escaping the weakening boundary. During one of the encounters, both Chase and Zedd are injured, but Kahlan and Richard find the pass. There, they meet the bone woman Adie, who shelters Chase and Zedd, and teaches them how to go through the pass.

Kahlan and Richard journey through the pass, nearly getting killed by dangerous creatures that live there. Once through, Richard asks Kahlan to lead them to the Mud People, a tribe with the ability to contact spirit ancestors, for guidance on how to prevent Rahl from seizing the third box of Orden. To summon the ancestors, they must be full members of the tribe. During this time, Richard and Kahlan fall in love, but a secret power held by Kahlan prevents a full relationship. After convincing the Mud People that they are honorable, and seek to help all humans, Richard and Kahlan become members of tribe. The elders then summon the ancestors, which reveal that the witch woman Shota, one of the most feared people in the Midlands, can reveal the location of the third box. Darken Rahl interrupts the gathering, slaughters several Mud People and kidnaps Siddin, a tribe member and friend of Richard.

Richard and Kahlan travel to Shota&#x27;s territory, where they learn that Queen Milena has the last box. Kahlan tells Richard her secret, that she is a Confessor, an enchanted person whose power of love destroys the minds of others and enslaves them. Shota also warns Richard that both Kahlan and Zedd will use their powers against him. The two travel to Tamarang, seat of Queen Milena, meeting back up with Zedd along the way. Upon reaching Tamarang, they discover that the last box is gone, and realize it was taken by Rahl.

Soon after, Richard is captured by a beautiful young Mord-Sith named Denna, who tortures him for a month. Mord-Sith wear skin-tight red leather catsuit, blood-red, to hide the blood of their captives during the training sessions. They live to torture and condition men into obedient pets, who live and breathe to please them, and Mistress Denna is the best of all Mord-Sith at this task. After only half an hour at her mercy, he is left groveling on the dungeon floor, begging to please his mistress to avoid pain. She manages to train and break him by the use of several instruments, including a painful small red leather rod by the name of the Agiel. Once Richard is broken, she takes him for her sexual mate. Mistress Denna reports to Darken Rahl, and Rahl hopes to force Richard to recite the Book of Counted Shadows, a magical book which Richard had memorized under the bequest of his father. However, after a month as her pet and slave, Richard&#x27;s innate gentleness alters their relationship, and Richard breaks free of Denna&#x27;s control. Rahl allows Richard to leave, but sets a wizard web on him which makes all of his friends think Richard is Rahl himself.

After helping a dragon named Scarlet find her egg, which had been stolen by Rahl, Richard discovers how to beat Rahl, and be with Kahlan. Kahlan, falsely thinking Richard dead by Rahl, uses her powers on him. Rahl, thinking Richard is now enslaved, uses him to recite the Book of Counted Shadows. In the end, Rahl opens the wrong Box of Orden, under Richard&#x27;s false guidance, thus killing Rahl. Richard reveals he was protected from Kahlan&#x27;s power by his already complete and unconditional love for her.

Zedd reveals that Richard is the progeny of Rahl&#x27;s rape of Zedd&#x27;s daughter. Thus, Zedd is Richard&#x27;s grandfather, and Richard is the new Lord Rahl. Kahlan and Richard set off for the Mud People&#x27;s village to return Siddin to his parents.

=== The Wizard&#x27;s First Rule ===
Each of the novels in the Sword of Truth series reveals a &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Rule&quot;—a magical principle that allows Wizards to be savvy manipulators of the world around them. The novel reveals the Wizard&#x27;s First Rule:
==Reception==
Terri Windling identified &quot;Wizard&#x27;s First Rule&quot; as one of the best fantasy debuts of 1994, saying that although the novel was &quot;derivative,&quot; it &quot;does have a certain charm and earnestness about it&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel &quot;a wonderfully creative, seamless, and stirring epic fantasy debut.&quot; Booklist favorably described the novel as the &quot;first volume of a saga&quot; and within the &quot;same breath as Robert Jordan&quot; but &quot;hardly an aspirant to Tolkien&#x27;s mantle.&quot; The review also stated that &quot;the characters and their world come to life, and Goodkind&#x27;s ambitious juxtaposition of modern ambiguities and the classical fantasy setting works more often than not.&quot; Library Journal called the novel &quot;an intriguing variant on the standard fantasy quest&quot; recommending the novel for &quot;mature fantasy aficionados&quot; noting the sado-eroticism of the Mord Sith might &quot;deter purchase by some libraries.&quot;

==TV series==
The first season of the TV series &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot; was based on &quot;Wizard&#x27;s First Rule&quot;. Starring Craig Horner as Richard and Bridget Regan as Kahlan, the series was produced by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert, and expanded upon some of the themes of the book&#x27;s storyline, but bore only a passing resemblance to the book on a grander scale. Terry Goodkind noted his lack of involvement and displeasure with the production in a 2019 AMA when he stated &quot;...after Disney bought [the rights to produce the show], they didn&#x27;t allow me to be involved in any way. It showed.&quot; It premiered on November 1, 2008 and ended in May 2010.

<text>The Lupemban is the name given by archaeologists to a central African culture which, though once thought to date between c. 30,000 and 12,000 BC, is now generally recognised to be far older (dates of c. 300,000 have been obtained from Twin Rivers, Zambia and Muguruk, Kenya, respectively). The industry is characterised by the occurrence of bi-facially flaked lanceolate points. It has been postulated that Lupemban tools, being generally distributed within the modern day Congo forest belt, may have been adapted to woodworking. The lanceolate points are commonly interpreted as being the surviving elements of composite spears.

Activity sites include: Kalambo Falls and Dundo.

<doc id="697403" wikidata="Q2796607" url="?curid=697403" title="Ikari Warriors">
<text>Ikari Warriors, known as in Japan, is a vertically scrolling run and gun video game released for arcades by SNK in 1986. It was published in North America by Tradewest. At the time there were many &quot;Commando&quot; clones on the market. What distinguished &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; were rotary joysticks and a two-player cooperative mode. The rotary joystick controls were in turn based on SNK&#x27;s earlier &quot;TNK III&quot; (1985). &quot;Ikari&quot; was originally intended to be an official licensed adaptation of the film &quot;&quot; (1985), but SNK were initially unable to acquire the rights to the film.

The game was a major commercial success in arcades. It was Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing table arcade in 1986, and London&#x27;s third highest-grossing arcade game that year. It was also a major breakthrough US release for SNK, ranking among America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games for two years in a row, in 1986 and 1987.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of commandos named Colonel Ralf Jones (red) and Second Lieutenant Clark Still (blue), who must try to reach the village of Ikari. Enemy units attempting to kill the player include tanks, enemy soldiers and helicopters. A number of power-ups along the way help the player achieve victory.

Players must proceed from the bottom of the screen upwards, towards the village of Ikari. Trying to prevent them from reaching the village are enemy soldiers and other units. Along the way, players may commandeer enemy tanks and helicopters (NES version) to help fight their way through the enemy personnel. The tanks are immune to enemy bullets, but have a limited supply of fuel and will sustain damage when it runs out or the tank is caught in an explosion, taking the player with it unless he can exit the tank and get clear before it blows up. The helicopters have two different weapons, a spread gun and a cannon, and may fly over water.

Rotating the joystick changes the direction the character faced independent of the direction the character was moving, as controlled by pushing the joystick. This gives the player freedom to attack or walk in eight different directions. No shot is fired from directly in front of the player; the warrior uses the machine gun in his right hand, and throws grenades with his left. If a player character takes too long moving up screen, the computer starts using &quot;call for fire&quot;. A red spot appears below him, which is tracking fire to speed up the game.

==Hardware==
&quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; uses SNK&#x27;s model LS-30 joysticks, which contain a 12-way rotary switch box. The joysticks can be rotated in addition to being pushed in eight directions. The less successful &quot;TNK III&quot;, released in 1985 and also from SNK, is the first to have used such joysticks. There are also two buttons: one for the standard gun and another for lobbing grenades.

&quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; printed circuit boards (PCBs) were manufactured in two different versions: SNK pinout and JAMMA pinout. Most SNK-pinout units were put into &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; cabinets, while most JAMMA-pinout units were supplied as conversion kits. The SNK-pinout boards have a 22/44-pin edge connectors. The JAMMA-pinout PCBs have a 28/56-pin edge connectors. Both types consist of a stack of three boards, with interconnects.

==Development==
The game was developed by SNK, where it was designed and directed by Koji Obada. He had previously designed SNK&#x27;s &quot;TNK III&quot; (1985), known as &quot;T.A.N.K.&quot; in Japan and Europe, a vertical tank shooter inspired by Taito&#x27;s &quot;Front Line&quot; (1982) that used rotary joystick controls. The same year, Capcom&#x27;s vertical run-and-gun shooter &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), known as &quot;Senjō no Ōkami&quot; (&quot;Wolf of the Battlefield&quot;) in Japan, had become a major global arcade hit. &quot;Ikari&quot; combined the run-and-gun shooter gameplay of &quot;Commando&quot; with the rotary joysticks and tank vehicles of &quot;T.A.N.K.&quot;

The game was also inspired by the action film &quot;&quot; (1985), released as &quot;Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu&quot; (&quot;Rambo: The Furious Escape&quot;) in Japan. Obada had originally intended the game to be an official licensed adaptation of &quot;Rambo&quot;, but SNK were initially unable to acquire the rights to the film. This resulted in the game&#x27;s title being shortened to &quot;Ikari&quot;, referencing part of the film&#x27;s Japanese title. After the game made its North American debut at an arcade game expo, they got in touch with the film&#x27;s star Sylvester Stallone, who was friends with SNK&#x27;s president, about acquiring the rights to the film, but it was too late by that point, as the game had already become popularly known by its Japanese title &quot;Ikari&quot; among arcade players in Japan and North America, leading to the game being officially released as &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; in North America.

==Regional differences==
In addition to changing the names of the main characters from Ralf and Clark to Paul and Vince, the military commander the player rescues at the end of the game is named General Kawasaki in the Japanese version (named after SNK&#x27;s founder Eikichi Kawasaki) and Colonel Cook in the US/Euro version (named after Tradewest&#x27;s founder Leland Cook). General Kawasaki&#x27;s name was unchanged in the NES version. The enemies in the game were actually Neo-Nazis, as evidenced by the presence of a swastika at the middle of the final room.

==Ports==

&quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; was initially ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64 and IBM PC by Quicksilver Software and published by Data East USA in the US in 1986. Elite Systems acquired the licence for Europe releasing the Amstrad CPC version in late 1986. A version for the ZX Spectrum by David Perry was scheduled for November 1986 but was never released.

In 1988 Elite published a second Commodore 64 port (by John Twiddy, programmer of &quot;The Last Ninja&quot;), a new ZX Spectrum port (by David Shea, author of the Amstrad version) along with versions for the Commodore 16, Amiga and Atari ST.

SNK released their own port for the MSX in 1987. The NES version was developed by Micronics. Both the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 ports were released in 1990 as one of the final published games for those systems during their initial eras. The game was also included on the &quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot; for various modern consoles and Windows (through Steam).

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Ikari&quot; on their March 15, 1986 issue as being the most-successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It remained at the top of the &quot;Game Machine&quot; table arcade cabinet charts through April and early May, before returning to the top in June 1986. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986. In the United Kingdom, it was one of the top three highest-grossing arcade games of 1986 in London, appearing at number-three on the annual 1986 Electrocoin chart.

In North America, &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; was the second top-grossing arcade game on the monthly &quot;Play Meter&quot; charts in July 1986. It went on to be one of the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1986 according to AMOA, and the year&#x27;s eight highest arcade video game according to &quot;RePlay&quot;. It was also among the top five dedicated arcade games of 1987.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version of &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; as number 61 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, lauding the innovative joysticks, play balance, and power-ups which offer an invigorating boost to the player character&#x27;s capabilities without taking away the game&#x27;s challenge.

===Conversions===
&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; enthusiastically reviewed the &quot;classy&quot; Amstrad personal computer conversion, calling the graphics &quot;simply brilliant&quot; and the gameplay &quot;awesomely addictive&quot;. They said that players &quot;won&#x27;t see better ... probably for quite a while&quot; because &quot;the Amstrad graphics are as close as dammit to the arcade machine and the playability goes off the &quot;C+VG&quot; scale&quot;.

The IBM PC version of the game received 4 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; spawned the sequels &quot;Victory Road&quot; (1986) and &quot;Ikari III: The Rescue&quot; (1989).

SNK released an &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; clone in 1987 called &quot;Guerrilla War&quot; (known as &quot;Guevara&quot; in Japan). The game features communist fighters Che Guevara and Fidel Castro as its heroes.

Sylvester Stallone, whose role as John Rambo had an influence on the game, owned an &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; arcade cabinet in the 1980s. The future mixed martial arts (MMA) champion Kazushi Sakuraba (later famous for defeating the Gracie family of Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters) was also a fan of &quot;Ikari&quot; in his high school years.

The characters Ralf and Clark appeared again as playable characters in &quot;Metal Slug 6&quot; and &quot;7&quot;, as well as in the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series. Their names were used for two minor unrelated characters in &quot;Crystalis&quot;, and they were featured as cameos in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as background characters in the King Of Fighters Stadium stage.

<doc id="697411" wikidata="Q471898" url="?curid=697411" title="Safe">
<text>A safe (also called a strongbox or coffer) is a secure lockable enclosure used for securing valuable objects against theft or fire. A safe is usually a hollow cuboid or cylinder, with one face being removable or hinged to form a door. The body and door may be cast from metal (such as steel) or formed out of plastic through blow molding. Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil thieves. One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around. 

==History==

The first known safe dates back to the 13th century BC and was found in the tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses II. It was made of wood and consisted of a locking system resembling the modern pin tumbler lock.
In the 16th century, blacksmiths in southern Germany, Austria, and France first forged cash boxes in sheet iron. These sheet-iron money chests served as the models for mass-produced cash boxes in the 19th century.

In the 17th century, in northern Europe, iron safes were sometimes made in the shape of a barrel, with a padlock on top.

In 1835, English inventors Charles and Jeremiah Chubb in Wolverhampton, England, received a patent for a burglar-resisting safe and began a production of safes. The Chubb brothers had produced locks since 1818. Chubb Locks was an independent company until 2000 when it was sold to Assa Abloy.

On November 2, 1886, inventor Henry Brown patented a &quot;receptacle for storing and preserving papers&quot;. The container was fire retardant and accident resistant as it was made from forged metal. The box was able to be safely secured with a lock and key and also able to maintain organization by offering different slots to organize important papers.

==Specifications==
Specifications for safes include some or all of the following parameters:
* Burglar-resistance
* Fire-resistance
* Environmental resistance (e.g., to water or dust)
* Type of lock (e.g., combination, key, time lock, electronic locking)
* Location (e.g., wall safe, floor safe)
* Smart safes as part of an automated cash handling system

It is often possible to open a safe without access to the key or knowledge of the combination; this activity is known as safe-cracking and is a popular theme in heist films.

A diversion safe, or hidden safe, is a safe that is made from an otherwise ordinary object such as a book, a candle, a can, or wall outlet. Valuables are placed in these hidden safes, which are themselves placed inconspicuously (for example, a book would be placed on a book shelf).
Fire-resistant record protection equipment consists of self-contained devices that incorporate insulated bodies, doors, drawers or lids, or non-rated multi-drawer devices housing individually rated containers that contain one or more inner compartments for storage of records. These devices are intended to provide protection to one or more types of records as evidenced by the assigned Class rating or ratings; Class 350 for paper, Class 150 for microfilm, microfiche other and photographic film and Class 125 for magnetic media and hard drives. Enclosures of this type are typically rated to protect contents for , 1, 2, or 4hours; they will not protect indefinitely. They may also be rated for their resistance to impact should the safe fall a specified distance onto a hard surface, or have debris fall upon it during a fire.

Burglary-resistant safes are rated as to their resistance to various types of tools and the duration of the attack.

Safes can contain hardware that automatically dispenses cash or validates bills as part of an automated cash handling system.

==Room-sized fireproof vaults==

For larger volumes of heat-sensitive materials, a modular room-sized vault is much more economical than purchasing and storing many fire rated safes. Typically these room-sized vaults are utilized by corporations, government agencies and off-site storage service firms. Fireproof vaults are rated up to Class 125-4 Hour for large data storage applications. These vaults utilize ceramic fiber, a high temperature industrial insulating material, as the core of their modular panel system. All components of the vault, not just the walls and roof panels, must be Class 125 rated to achieve that overall rating for the vault. This includes the door assembly (a double door is needed since there is no single Class 125 vault door available), cable penetrations, coolant line penetrations (for split HVAC systems), and air duct penetrations.

There are also Class 150 applications (such as microfilm) and Class 350 vaults for protecting valuable paper documents. Like the data-rated (Class 125) structures, these vault systems employ ceramic fiber insulation and components rated to meet or exceed the required level of protection.

In recent years room-sized Class 125 vaults have been installed to protect entire data centers. As data storage technologies migrate from tape-based storage methods to hard drives, this trend is likely to continue.

==Fire-resistant safes==
A fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual fire. Fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces, while not exceeding a set internal temperature, e.g., less than . Models are typically available between half-hour and four-hour durations.

In the UK, the BS EN-1047 standard is set aside for data and document safes to determine their ability to withstand prolonged intense heat and impact damage.
* Document safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than while in a constantly heated environment in excess of .
* Data safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than while in a constantly heated environment in excess of .
These conditions are maintained for the duration of the test. This is usually at least 30 minutes but can extend to many hours depending on grade.
Both kinds of safe are also tested for impact by dropping from a set height onto a solid surface and then tested for fire survivability once again.

In the United States, both the writing of standards for fire-resistance and the actual testing of safes is performed by Underwriters Laboratories.

An in-floor safe installed in a concrete floor is very resistant to fire. However, not all floor safes are watertight; they may fill with water from fire hoses. Contents can be protected against water damage by appropriate packaging.

Reinforced, fireproof cabinets are also used for dangerous chemicals or flammable goods.

==Wall safes==
Wall safes are designed to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables. Adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses. Some wall safes have pry-resistant recessed doors with concealed hinges. A painting or other wall decoration may be hung over a wall safe to hide it.

Small safes may be fixed to a wall to prevent the entire safe being removed, without concealment. Very small secure enclosures known as key safes, opened by entering a combination, are attached to the wall of a building to store the keys allowing access, so that they are available only to a person knowing the combination, typically for holiday lets, carers, or emergency use.

==Safe-cracking==

Safe-cracking is opening a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods of safe-cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method that can be used on many safes is &quot;safe bouncing&quot;, which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the locking pin to budge, opening the safe.

Physicist Richard Feynman gained a reputation for safe-cracking while working on the Manhattan Project during the Second World War. He did this for recreation, describing his experiences and methods in detail in his book &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;. He made the point that the secure storage he successfully opened clandestinely (to which he would have been given access if he asked) contained contents far more important than any thief had ever accessed, all the secrets of the wartime atomic bomb project.

==UL Safe Standards==
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) testing certifications are known to be some of the most rigorous and most respected in the world. UL provides numerous ratings, the most common security and fire ratings as discussed below. UL ratings are the typical rating standards used for safes within the United States. They are only matched by B.T.U/VDMA certifications (Germany).

===Fire ratings ===

UL provides a variety of fire rating classifications, 125, 150, and 350 representing the maximum internal temperature in degrees Fahrenheit the safe may not exceed during the test. The classifications come in durations from -hour to 4 hours in length. The safe is exposed to gradually higher temperatures depending on the duration of the test. The most common standards being the 350 one hour (1,700 degrees) and 350 two hour (1,850 degrees) ratings as the temperature paper chars is approximately 451 degrees Fahrenheit.

=== Burglary ratings ===
UL standards are one of the principal North American protection standards. The resistance time limit specifies &quot;tools on the safe&quot; time without access to contents. The test might take hours to run and can be repeated as many times as the UL staff feel necessary to ensure that all prospective avenues of attack have been thoroughly explored.

==== Residential Security Containers (RSC) ====
This is the entry level security rating offered by Underwriters Laboratories and it has its own standard: (UL 1037). The standard originally had one level, now known as RSC Level I. The standard was expanded in 2016 providing a greater range of security options. This standard also involves a drop test for products weighing not more than 750 pounds, simulating attempting to gain entry by dropping the safe.

* RSC Level I - Must withstand a five-minute attack by one technician using common hand tools such as drills, screwdrivers and hammers.
* RSC Level II - Must withstand a ten-minute attack by two technicians who use more aggressive tools such as picks, sledgehammers, pry bars, high-speed carbide drills and pressure applying devices. In addition, the technicians will attempt to make a six-square-inch opening in the door or the front face of the safe.
* RSC Level III - Also gives two technicians a ten-minute window to perform the test, but the range of tools become even more aggressive, and the size of the maximum attack opening must not exceed two square inches.

==== Tool-Resistant Safe (TL) ====

Safes at this level are typically, but not exclusively, used for commercial applications such as jewelers and coin dealers. These ratings are granted to combination locked safes that successfully resist when attacked by two technicians with common hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or portable electric tools, grinding points, carbide drills and pressure applying devices or mechanisms. In addition to those requirements, the safe must weigh at least 750 pounds or come with instructions for anchoring, and have body walls of material equivalent to at least 1&quot; open hearth steel with a minimum tensile strength of 50,000psi. The UL Standard for tool-resistant safes and above are governed by UL Standard 687.

* TL-15 - This is a combination-locked safe that offers &quot;limited protection&quot; against combinations of common mechanical and electrical tools. The safe will resist abuse for 15 minutes from tools such as hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or electric tools, grinding points, carbide drills and devices that apply pressure. While the UL 687 defines this as a &quot;limited degree&quot; of protection, that standard is used for commercial applications, and the TL-15 rating offers significantly better protection than many unrated safes.
* TL-30 - This safe offers &quot;moderate&quot; &quot;protection&quot; against combinations of mechanical and electrical tools. The safe will resist abuse for 30 minutes from the same tools as the TL-15 test, plus more aggressive tools including cutting wheels and power saws.
* TL-30x6 - This is safe can withstand the same assaults as the TL-30 but protection is offered on all six-sides of the body as opposed to only the door.

==== Torch &amp; Tool Resistant Safe (TRTL) ====

* TRTL-30x6 - This is a combination-locked safe that offers &quot;high protection&quot; against combinations of mechanical, electrical, and cutting tools. The safe will resist abuse for 30 minutes from tools such as hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or electrical tools, grinding points, carbide drills, devices that apply pressure, cutting wheels, power saws, impact tools and, in addition, can withstand an oxy-fuel welding and cutting torch (tested gas limited to combined total oxygen and fuel gas.)
* TRTL-60x6 - This class will withstand the same assaults as Class TRTL-30x6 for 60 minutes.

==== Torch, Explosive &amp; Tool Resistant Safe (TXTL) ====

* TXTL-60x6 - This class meets all the requirements for Class TRTL-60x6 and in addition can withstand detonation of one charge of of nitroglycerin, or other high explosive of equivalent energy. Multiple charges up to a total of may be used.

==European safe standards==
Depending on the usage, the European Committee for Standardization has published different European standards for safes. Testing and certification according to these standards should be done by an accredited certification body, e.g. European Certification Body.
* EN 1143-1 is the main testing standard for safes, ATM safes, strongroom doors and strongrooms. For safes it features eleven resistance grades (0, I, II, ..., to X). From one grade to the next the security rises by approximately 50%. Testing is based on a free choice of attack tools and methods. Testing requires partial access (hand hole) and complete access attempts, on all sides of the product. The security is calculated by using ratings of tools and the attack time. The result is expressed in resistance units (RU).
* EN 14450 is a testing standard for secure cabinets and strongboxes. The standard covers products meant for purposes where the security resistance required is less than that of EN 1143–1.

For fire-resistant safes the EN 1047-1 (fire resistance standard similar to the fire resistance safe standard of UL) and EN 15659 (for light fire storage units) were published.

<doc id="697416" wikidata="Q1125833" url="?curid=697416" title="Talk.origins">
<text>talk.origins (often capitalised to Talk.Origins or abbreviated as t.o.) is a Usenet discussion forum concerning the origins of life, and evolution. Its official purpose is to draw such debates out of the science newsgroups, such as sci.bio.evolution and sci.bio.paleontology. With the general decline of evolution/creationism debate and discontinuation of Google Groups support for Usenet in February 2024, Talk.Origins is now largely defunct.

== History ==
The first post to talk.origins was a starter post by Mark Horton, dated 5 September 1986.

In the early 1990s, a number of FAQs on various topics were being periodically posted to the newsgroup. In 1994, Brett J. Vickers established an anonymous FTP site to host the collected FAQs of the newsgroup. In 1995, Vickers started the TalkOrigins Archive web site as another means of hosting the talk.origins FAQs. It maintains an extensive FAQ on topics in evolutionary biology, geology and astronomy, with the aim of representing the views of mainstream science. It has spawned other websites, notably TalkDesign &quot;a response to the intelligent design movement&quot;, Evowiki, and the Panda&#x27;s Thumb weblog.

The group was originally created as the unmoderated newsgroup net.origins as a &#x27;dumping ground&#x27; for all the various flame threads &#x27;polluting&#x27; other newsgroups, then renamed to talk.origins as part of the Great Renaming. Subsequently, after discussion on the newsgroup, the group was voted to be moderated in 1997 by the normal USENET RFD/CFV process, in which only spam and excessive crossposting are censored. The moderator for the newsgroup is David Iain Greig (and technically Jim Lippard as alternate/backup).

== Culture ==
The group is characterized by a long list of in-crowd jokes like the fictitious University of Ediacara, the equally fictitious &quot;Evil Atheist Conspiracy&quot; which allegedly hides all the evidence supporting Creationism, a monthly election of the &quot;Chez Watt&quot;-award for &quot;statements that make you go &#x27;say what&#x27;, or some such&quot;, pun cascades, a strong predisposition to quoting Monty Python, and a habit of calling penguins &quot;the best birds&quot;.

Apart from the humor, the group includes rebuttals to creationist claims. There is an expectation that any claim is to be backed up by actual evidence, preferably in the form of a peer-reviewed publication in a reputable journal. The group as a whole votes for a PoTM-award (Post of The Month), which makes it into the annals of TalkOrigins Archive.

<text>The Irish News is a compact daily newspaper based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest-selling morning newspaper and is available throughout Ireland. It is broadly Irish nationalist in its viewpoint, though it also features unionist columnists.

==History==
&quot;The Irish News&quot; is the only independently owned daily newspaper based in Northern Ireland, and has been so since its launch on 15 August 1891 as an anti-Parnell newspaper by Patrick MacAlister. It merged with the &quot;Belfast Morning News&quot; in August 1892, and the full title of the paper has since been &quot;The Irish News and Belfast Morning News&quot;. T.P. Campbell was editor from 1895 until 1906, when he was succeeded by Tim McCarthy, who served as editor until 1928. Appointed in 1999, Noel Doran served as editor until 2024 when he was succeeded by Chris Sherrard.

&quot;The Irish News&quot; saw a dramatic growth in its circulation with the beginning of The Troubles in 1969; this peaked around the time of the peak in violence in 1971, and declined thereafter.

In June 1982, the paper came under the control of the company&#x27;s present owners, with Martin O&#x27;Brien as Editor.

In May 2023, the newspaper relocated from its premises at 113-117 Donegall Street, its home for more than a century, to modern offices on College Street. The &quot;Irish News&quot;″s departure from Donegall Street marks the end of the street&#x27;s association with print journalism, which earned it the nickname of Belfast&#x27;s Fleet Street. The Donegall Street building was sold to Ulster University.

In September 2023, the newspaper got its first new look since March 2005.

<text>3850 Peltier, provisional designation , is a Florian asteroid and suspected interloper from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 October 1986, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station, near Flagstaff, Arizona. The asteroid was named after American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier.

== Orbit and classification ==

In the SMASS taxonomy, &quot;Peltier&quot; is a V-type asteroid but possesses the orbital characteristics of a member of the Flora family, which is one of the largest groups of stony S-type asteroids in the main-belt. It is therefore thought to be an unrelated interloper that does not origin from the Flora family&#x27;s parent body. &quot;Peltier&quot; orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. In 1949, it was first identified as at Johannesburg. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1979, when it was identified as , 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Rotation period ===

A rotational lightcurve of &quot;Peltier&quot; was obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory in October 2006. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 2.4287 hours with a brightness variation of 0.09 magnitude (). In December 2013, photometric observations by Australian amateur astronomer Julian Oey gave a concurring period of 2.4289 hours and an amplitude of 0.10 magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

&quot;Peltier&quot; has not been observed by any space-based surveys such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, or NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for V-type asteroids of 0.40 and calculates a diameter of 4.00 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 13.6.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in memory of American amateur astronomer Leslie Peltier (1900–1980), who has discovered 12 comets and several novae including Nova Herculis 1963. Naming citation was provided by David H. Levy and published by the MPC on 20 May 1989 ().

<text>The San Rafael River is a tributary of the Green River, approximately long, in east central Utah, United States. The river flows across a sparsely populated arid region of the Colorado Plateau, and is known for the isolated, scenic gorge through which it flows.

==Description==
The river rises in northwestern Emery County, approximately southeast of Castle Dale, by the confluence of Cottonwood, Huntington and Ferron creeks, which provide its headwaters in the Wasatch Plateau region. It flows east-southeast along the north side of the Coal Cliffs and the prominent anticline called the San Rafael Swell, passing north of Window Butte (Window Blind Peak) and through two narrow slot canyons in Coconino Sandstone called the Upper and Lower Black Box. This area is known as the San Rafael Gorge, sometimes called the &quot;Little Grand Canyon&quot;. (Actually, the &quot;Little Grand Canyon&quot; is a few miles upstream where the San Rafael passes between the Wedge on the north and Sid&#x27;s Mountain and No Man&#x27;s Mountain on the south). After passing through the San Rafael Reef it enters the 15 miles (24 km) long San Rafael Valley, where it joins the Green River from the west, approximately south of the town of Green River. The San Rafael is the last major tributary of the Green River before it joins the Colorado River in Canyonlands National Park.

Diversion tunnels at the headwaters of the river in the Manti-La Sal National Forest provide irrigation water to Sanpete County on the west side of the Wasatch Plateau.

<doc id="697436" wikidata="Q1413759" url="?curid=697436" title="Digging stick">
<text>A digging stick, sometimes called a yam stick, is a wooden implement used primarily by subsistence-based cultures to dig out underground food such as roots and tubers, tilling the soil, or burrowing animals and anthills. It is a term used in archaeology and anthropology to describe similar implements, which usually consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and sometimes hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire.

Fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing, it forms a prehistoric plough, and is also described as a type of hoe.
Digging sticks more than 170,000 years old, made of boxwood by Neanderthals, have been found in Italy.

== By region ==
=== Americas ===
In Mexico and the Mesoamerican region, the digging stick was the most important agricultural tool throughout the region.

The &quot;coa&quot; stick normally flares out into a triangle at the end and is used for cultivating maize. It is still used for agriculture in some indigenous communities, with some newer 20th-century versions having the addition of a little metal tip.

Other digging sticks, according to Native Americans of the Columbia Plateau, have been used since time immemorial to gather edible roots like balsamroot, bitterroot, camas, and varieties of biscuitroot. Typical digging sticks were and are still about 2 to 3 feet in length, usually slightly arched, with the bottom tip shaved off at an angle. A 5 to 8 inch cross-piece made of antler, bone, or wood was fitted perpendicularly over the top of the stick, allowing the use of two hands to drive the tool into the ground. Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks.

===Asia-Pacific===
====Australia====

Digging sticks are used by many of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia, for digging up roots and tubers and for ceremonial use.

The Gunditjmara people of western Victoria used digging sticks, also known as &quot;yam sticks&quot;, for digging yams, goannas, ants and other foods out of the ground, as well as for defence, for settling disputes and for punishment purposes as part of customary law.

==== New Guinea ====
The Kuman people east-central New Guinea were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more sophisticated tools such as iron spades and pick-axes.

Two main types of digging sticks both shared a similar shape but differed in size:

* A larger and heavier digging stick with a diameter of about and in length, used for the purpose of turning over the soil surface for new gardens; and
* A smaller and lighter digging stick with a diameter of about and (or less) in length, mainly used for basic horticulture tasks.

====New Zealand====

The Māori people traditionally use digging sticks, known as a &quot;kō&quot; to long pole was made of strong and long-lasting wood, with a footrest tied to the shaft and one end fashioned into a narrow blade. They were used for tilling soil ready for planting tubers, as well as for digging for roots or tubers, and in ceremonial use.

===East Africa===
==== Ethiopia ====

The most common digging stick found in Ethiopia is the &quot;ankassay&quot; in Amharic, a Semitic language spoken in Ethiopia and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world. The &quot;ankassay&quot; is a single shaft that is about 4–5 feet in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip.

Two other digging sticks are unique to the Harar region located in East-Central Ethiopia, which are considered to be unusual due to their function beyond the basic use of other digging sticks, and the use of one as a plough.

The &quot;deungora&quot; is a particularly long digging stick, which is about 110 centimetres, or approximately 3.6 feet, in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip. What&#x27;s unique about this digging stick is that a bored stone, about 15 centimetres in diameter, is attached at the opposing end. This stone shares the same form as other bored stones that have been discovered in archaeological sites in Africa.

&quot;Maresha&quot; is the Gurage name, also the same word used by the Amhara, for a digging stick that differs in construction because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool is used as a plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used to break clods of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for ploughing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants. When compared to the &quot;ankassay&quot;, this digging stick can perform the same duties and in addition can be used as a hoe.

<doc id="697452" wikidata="Q5447308" url="?curid=697452" title="Fiesta (dinnerware)">
<text>Fiesta is a line of ceramic glazed dinnerware manufactured and marketed by the Fiesta Tableware Company of Newell, West Virginia since its introduction in 1936, with a hiatus from 1973 to 1985. Fiesta is noted for its Art Deco styling and its range of often bold, solid colors.

The company was known as the Homer Laughlin China Company (HLCC) until 2020, when it sold its food service divisions, along with the &quot;Homer Laughlin&quot; name, to Steelite, a British tableware manufacturer. HLCC in turn rebranded itself as the Fiesta Tableware Company, retaining its retail division, prominent Fiesta line, factories and headquarters in Newell, West Virginia.

Fiesta&#x27;s original shapes and glazes were designed by Frederick Hurten Rhead, Homer Laughlin&#x27;s art director from 1927 until his death in 1942. Fiesta products before 1986 were semi-vitreous pottery, and after 1986 were vitreous china allowing marketing it for food service applications. Several of the original shapes had to be modified due to this change in material and other new shapes were added by Jonathan O. Parry, who became Homer Laughlin&#x27;s art director in 1984.

Since its inception, Fiesta has been sold in sets or from &quot;open stock&quot;, where customers can select, mix and match pieces from the entire color range. Notably, certain early glazes resulted in pieces that were slightly radioactive.

According to the Smithsonian Institution Press, Fiesta&#x27;s appeal lies in its colors, design, and affordability. In 2002, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Fiesta &quot;the most collected brand of china in the United States&quot;.

==Popularity and marketing==

Fiesta was introduced at the annual Pottery and Glass Exhibit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in January 1936. It was not the first solid color dinnerware in the US; smaller companies, especially Bauer Pottery in California, had been producing dinnerware, vases, and garden pottery, in solid color glazes for the better part of a decade by the time Fiesta was introduced to the market. However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color dinnerware in the US.

When it was introduced, the decoration of dinnerware and kitchenware ceramics was still inspired by the Victorian era, based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same decal designs. With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public. The forms and surfaces expressed an Art Deco influence. At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray. A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter. The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer. But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.

As an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said:

&quot;COLOR! that&#x27;s the trend today ...&quot; and it went on to say, &quot;It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it&#x27;s FUN to set a table with Fiesta!&quot; 

The Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line. During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers. In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items. At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower vases in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, carafes, teapots in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters. In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.

With World War II and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined. Beginning in 1942, the number and variety of items in the Fiesta line began to be reduced. Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were discontinued, and by 1946, the line&#x27;s variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third. Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948. The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized art deco shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing. From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad. The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households. Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on auction websites and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.

==1936–1969==
The line name and design is still owned by the Fiesta Tableware Company formerly called the Homer Laughlin China Company of Newell, West Virginia, which was the original company that produced and marketed it. Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969. As home decorating color styles changed, the company did change the solid color glaze assortment offered. The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque. This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell. The ware sometimes shows &quot;glaze curtains&quot;, areas of uneven glazing where a heavier application meets a lighter one.

At its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: 
*Red (orange red) (1936–1943, 1959–1972),
*Blue (cobalt) (1936–1950) [This color had the same name as a contemporary production color, but was lighter, bluer, less dark],
*Green (light green) (1936–1950),
*Yellow (deep golden) (1936–1969), [This color had the same name as a contemporary production color, now discontinued, but was much darker in tone],
*Old Ivory (yellowish cream) (1936–1950).

By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: 
*Turquoise (robin&#x27;s egg blue) (1938–1969) [This color also had the same name as a contemporary production color but was less greenish]. 
With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until about 1950. The first known company price list showing the new colors is dated 1951. The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).

The discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States&#x27; participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s. Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued such as covered onion soup bowls and covers for the nested mixing bowls and those had been discontinued by 1938. These early discontinued items, especially the covered onion soup bowls in the turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.

By 1950, after the end of the second World War and with the housing boom of returning GIs, home decorating styles and colors had changed. The manufacturer decided to retire some original glaze colors and replace them with four new modern colors in keeping with the changing decorative style.

The original Yellow and Turquoise of the prior decade remained in production but were augmented by four new colors:
*Rose (dark brownish pink) (1950–1959),
*Gray (medium) (1950–1959),
*Forest (dark green) (1950–1959,
*Chartreuse (bright yellowish green) (1950–1959).
Thus the company continued to offer six colors as it had done through most of Fiesta&#x27;s first decade.

Through the 1950s sales of Fiesta continued to decrease from its first boom years of the 1930s. The company reduced its offering of items. But when in 1959 the United States government released its block on uranium, which enabled the manufacturer to once again produce the original bright orange-red glaze (see below), the company saw an opportunity to revive sales. The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the original yellow and turquoise colors, and a newly introduced bright green color were the four glaze color assortment offered to the public in 1959. This new shade of green was officially simply called 
*Green (1959–1969) but has been nick-named &quot;medium green&quot; by collectors to distinguish it from the other earlier greens. The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green. Some have described it as a &quot;John Deere Tractor&quot; green.

This final four color glaze assortment of original Fiesta continued in production until 1969.

Although this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959–1969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen. Because overall sales of the line had decreased, this newest shade of green is seen as in very short supply on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors. Both Yellow and Turquoise had been in continuous production since the earliest days, and Red had previously been in production, so on the secondary market those colors were more easily available. The last glaze color, called Medium Green was only produced during that decade, and so with less overall sales of the line, there was proportionally less product sold in this glaze color. As a consequence it has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.

The Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta. Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta&#x27;s production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969. Red, while an original color at the line&#x27;s introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below). Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued. Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production. While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the &quot;Original 6&quot; or &quot;Fifties Colors&quot;.

==Radioactive glazes==
Brilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of uranium oxide in its glaze, which produced the orange-red color. During World War II, the government took control of uranium for development of the atom bomb, and confiscated the company&#x27;s stocks. Homer Laughlin discontinued Fiesta red in 1944. The company reintroduced Fiesta red in 1959 using depleted uranium (rather than the original natural uranium), after the Atomic Energy Commission relaxed its restrictions on uranium oxide. In addition to pottery glazing, uranium oxide was used even more extensively in the tiling industry, producing uranium tile.

Red is not the only color of vintage ceramic glaze that is radioactive; it is detectable from other colors, including ivory. The level of radioactivity of vintage fiestaware has been published and is available online.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns consumers not to use radioactive glazed ceramics for food or drink use. Others recommend against using such pieces for food storage due to the possibility of leaching of uranium or other heavy metals (often present in some colored glazes) into food, especially acidic foods. Consumption of uranium from regular use of such dishware, estimated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, amounted to potential doses of about 0.4 mSv per year.

==1969–1973==
By 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed. The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it. Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance. The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces. These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes. Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red. Replacing Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors. One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular Avocado color of the day. The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era. The line&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Fiesta Ironstone&quot;. The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta&#x27;s popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.

==Decaled and decorated Fiesta shapes==
As is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names. Throughout its long life (1936–1973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation. One example was &quot;Fiesta Casuals&quot;, which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.

As another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark &#x27;bean-pot&#x27; brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze &#x27;Mediterranean-style&#x27; geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as &quot;Amberstone&quot; in a supermarket promotion. Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze. This line was dubbed &quot;Casualstone&quot; for another supermarket promotion.

==Collectors and the secondary market==
During the 1970s, a new appreciation for Art Deco designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished. Along with this, the baby boomers were establishing their own households. They made Fiesta popular once again. Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular garage sales. Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions. Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed. By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, some Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding hundreds of U.S. dollars for scarcer items. By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher. Certain very rare pieces and colors were being traded for thousands of dollars.

==Contemporary Fiesta from 1986 ==


The Homer Laughlin China Company noticed the activity on the secondary market. After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction. Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969–1973). The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable. Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay. Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller. In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.

In 1986, Laughlin offered five colors:
*Rose (pink) (1986–2005) [This color changed significantly in the post-2000 firings but was still considered the same Rose],
*Black (black) (1986–2015),
*Cobalt (dark navy blue) (1986–2021),
*White (bright stark white) (1986–),
*Apricot (pale pinkish tan) (1986–1998).

The glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much more glossy than the original Fiesta. Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular. In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines. Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers. Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying only from the new assortment. Early in Fiesta&#x27;s second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new collectible. The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the collectors&#x27; market over the past 34 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames. Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.

The Homer Laughlin China Company has produced new Fiesta in a total of 39 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta. As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color glazes. In addition to the first five glazes, the names of the new color glazes, in order of introduction, are:
*Yellow (pale custard/butter) (1987–2002),
*Turquoise (more greenish than vintage Turquoise) (1988–),
*Periwinkle (slightly lavenderish-blue) (1989–2006),
*Sea Mist (pale mint green) (1991–2005),
*Lilac (soft purple) (1993–1995),
*Persimmon (pinkish-orange) (1995–2008),

===Special edition colors===
Since the reintroduction of Fiesta in 1986, Homer Laughlin has introduced three colors which were each available for only two years: Lilac (1993–1995), Chartreuse (1997–1999) and Juniper (2000–2001). Sapphire was sold exclusively at Bloomingdale&#x27;s from 1996 to 1997. In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate. The color of milk chocolate, the new shade added a second neutral tone to Fiesta&#x27;s color palette. It was available for a limited period of time and on a limited number of pieces.

In 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of dinnerware carrying the name Fiesta produced by the Homer Laughlin China Company since 1936. In anticipation of Fiesta&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold. In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in Chicago, Illinois. This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen. Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011–2012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.

As an indication of its influence, Fiesta was featured in a design exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York City in 1988.

===Square Fiesta dinnerware===
In 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced. Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories. 
Despite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company&#x27;s established &#x27;round&#x27; deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand&#x27;s signature concentric rings.

In October 2016, the Homer Laughlin Company announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923).

==In popular culture==
&quot;American Fiesta&quot;, a one-man play, refers to the central character&#x27;s obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.

<doc id="697455" wikidata="Q7765552" url="?curid=697455" title="The South End">
<text>The South End is the official student newspaper of Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, published in print and online. It was founded in 1967, and its publication is funded partly from university funds and partly from advertising revenues. It is distributed free of charge.

The paper is published in print once a month during the fall and winter terms but produces an e-edition weekly and posts new online content daily. During the summer, The South End publishes content exclusively online, with the exception of its special editions: the Freshman Survival Guide, an informative publication for new students, and the Back to School issue, which is printed the first week of the fall semester. On the website, users can access The South End&#x27;s previous editions in PDF format. The printed circulation is 8,000 and the online readership community is over 30,000. While the majority of contributing and staff writers for the paper are journalism majors, any Wayne State student may write articles for it.

== Sections of the paper ==

&quot;The South End&quot; primarily covers Wayne State&#x27;s campus and Midtown Detroit. It has news, arts &amp; entertainment, features, sports and multimedia sections.

Other features of The South End include columns, editorials, occasional cartoons and stories from The Associated Press News Wire. On its website, &quot;The South End&quot; offers up-to-date stories, photo galleries, videos, online polls and links to its weekly PDF issues.

=== News ===
In most cycles, the South End&#x27;s news section operated under two news editors. While the majority of coverage centers on the WSU campus and Midtown neighborhood, the newspaper has also covered events in downtown Detroit, Corktown and Southwest Detroit. In recent years, &quot;The South End&quot; has covered a number of major events, including the 2011 protests outside Catherine Ferguson Academy after it was slated to close, the 2011 shooting death of WSU football player Cortez Smith and the beginnings of the Occupy Detroit movement.

=== Arts &amp; Entertainment ===
The A&amp;E section of &quot;The South End&quot; covers Detroit and WSU theaters, galleries, music/dance performances, concerts and fashion events. Movie reviews have become popular in the paper, as well as regular columns from writers.

=== Sports ===
&quot;The South End&quot; sports section predominantly focuses on WSU teams, including men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, swimming/diving and tennis. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, softball, swimming/diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. In 2011, &quot;The South End&quot; covered the WSU football team as it made its run at the NCAA Division II championship.

=== Features ===
After having lapsed for a couple of years, the features section is once again a regular part of &quot;The South End&quot;. The section covers profiles of businesses and people around campus, as well as general feature pieces on a variety of topics.

== History of the paper ==
Copies of The South End and its predecessors (from 1917 to present) are housed in the Wayne State University Archives at the Walter P. Reuther Library, 5401 Cass Avenue.

=== The 1960s ===
Before &quot;The South End&quot;, the paper was called &quot;The Daily Collegian.&quot; Prior to that, it was &quot;The Wayne Collegian&quot; and &quot;The Detroit Collegian.&quot; The last year of &quot;The Daily Collegian&quot; was Volume 57, while the first year of &quot;The South End&quot; was Volume 58, in 1967. William Rea Keast, the university president at the time, objected to the name, which was intended to reflect the newspaper office&#x27;s location on the south end of the campus, a working-class area that was the focal point of leftist politics at the time. The logo of the paper then consisted of the name in lowercase over a drawing of a city skyline. In its first few years, &quot;The South End&quot; published a lot of poetry.

On September 26, 1968, when John Watson took over as editor-in-chief, the paper changed radically, both in design and in editorial policy. What had been a more or less ordinary student newspaper became a radical broadside, with a more casual approach to layout, spelling, and some would maintain, accuracy. A drawing of a small black panther facing to the right was added on both sides of the logo, which remained the same. From October 15 to the end of the year, the black panther on the right was flipped to face left, for symmetry. This symbolized the paper&#x27;s ties with the Black Panthers and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. The LRBW was an organization founded by Watson with other black radicals, including Ken Cockrel, that aimed to link the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) and other auto plant Revolutionary Union Movements associated with the Panthers that were active in Southeast Michigan in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this era, the newspaper also ran a standing quotation under its masthead stating, &quot;One class-conscious worker is worth 100 students.&quot;

=== The 1980s ===
Twice during the late 1980s, left-leaning editors refused to run advertising from branches of the U.S. military. This resulted in at least one case in which the editor, Patricia Maceroni, was removed by the SNPB. She later resumed her editorship following a court challenge to the firing.

=== The 1990s ===
Much of the 1990s was spent upgrading the paper&#x27;s notoriously lax standards with in-house style and grammar guides; adding strict editorial policies banning opinions from articles and a coherent editorial page featuring opinions from both sides of the political spectrum; and introducing the Associated Press wire to allow editors the use of AP stories in what was a steadily growing newspaper. Many of these standards fell by the wayside in subsequent years due to the high turnover in staff common at university newspapers.

In 1995, the newspaper won a gold medal from the College Newspaper Critique of Columbia University. In 1996, it featured exclusive interviews with the state&#x27;s gubernatorial candidates and firsthand coverage of the national election. In 1998, &quot;The South End&quot; changed from a tabloid to a broadsheet format and added color pages. Weekday papers averaged 16–20 pages each, and special issues approached 72 pages. Distribution was extended as far as restaurants and bars downtown to the south and the New Center area to the north.

=== The 2000s ===
The 21st century brought considerable change to the paper, not all of it positive. Circulation of &quot;The South End&quot; spiked when guest columnist Joe Fisher wrote a controversial column entitled &quot;Islam Sucks&quot; in the February 26, 2002 issue. The column was mentioned by noted journalist Jack Lessenberry in his &quot;Metro Times&quot; column, saying that it should have been titled &quot;Fundamentalist Islam sucks.&quot; &quot;The South End&quot; received so much mail about Fisher&#x27;s column that they were printing letters for days, including letters from anti-defamation leagues.

Following the controversy, the paper often went in an ideologically opposite direction, reflecting its lack of a coherent editorial philosophy at the time. When a student group consisting mostly of Arab-American women got together on campus to protest the 2003 occupation of Iraq on April 13, 2004, the paper reported on the protest the next day with a distinctly slanted headline reading &quot;Students Rally for Justice.&quot; On January 19, 2006, the paper also provided an objective report on one of the Five Pillars of Islam with a headline reading &quot;Performing The Hajj.&quot; When the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons erupted later on, &quot;The South End&quot; consciously decided not to reprint the cartoons even though other student newspapers around the country did.

From 2003 to 2004, the circulation was highly unreliable and spotty when the task was entrusted to WSU&#x27;s interoffice mail. It was during that school year that a gray line drawing of a tower of Old Main (a campus building) was added to the paper&#x27;s name atop the front page.

In April 2004, the Conservative Union, a student group at Wayne State, started a biweekly newspaper, &quot;The Wayne Review&quot; without university funding to counter what they considered to be &quot;South End&quot; radical left-wing bias with a conservative viewpoint. Wonetha Jackson, then editor-in-chief of &quot;The South End&quot;, wrote a column extending good wishes to the new paper. The &quot;Wayne Review&quot; often included a section called &quot;The Back End,&quot; an obvious parody of &quot;The South End&quot;, on its last page. &quot;Wayne Review&quot; editors often wrote letters to &quot;The South End&quot;. In 2004, the Knight Ridder wire horoscope was occasionally replaced by the &quot;Warrior Spirit Horoscope,&quot; with predictions meant for WSU students made using features invented by Johannes Kepler.

For the April 1, 2005 issue, the paper ran a satire issue called The Rear End, which printed the date as &quot;March 32, 2005&quot; and ran fake news stories such as &quot;WSU partiers conquer, reign,&quot; &quot;Raisin mistaken for roach, student still catches buzz&quot; and &quot;Warriors Basketball awarded National Championship.&quot; The issue was code-named &quot;Onion&quot;, after the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion.&quot; For that issue, the paper had a color logo of a humorously anthropomorphic Old Main tower with its rear end exposed.

After that issue, the old gray line drawing was replaced by a color photo of the facade of Old Main with a blue sky, though the blue sky was removed after three issues. In summer 2005, the Fusion (science and technology) and Campus Life sections were cancelled to make more room for prepared full pages from the KRT wire service.

The paper did not recover from the usual summer advertising slump. As a consequence, the vast majority of issues of the Fall 2005 semester were six pages, with eight-page issues being the exception rather than the norm (compared to the fall 2004 semester, when most issues were eight to 10 pages, and sometimes even 12).

A major redesign of the surface details of the paper took place with the first issue of the winter 2006 semester. Justified paragraphs, a constant source of layout problems in the past, were discarded completely in favor of ragged right margins like the &quot;Detroit News&quot; uses in many of its sections. The picture of Old Main on the front page was removed, and the listing of the staff was moved to a less prominent position on the second page using a smaller font.

The June 15, 2006, issue marked a three-year record low number of pages, with just four. The May 7, 2007, issue showed another redesign of surface details, including the use of lowercase in the masthead.

In September 2007, the paper changed from a daily to a weekly, distributed on Wednesdays (the same day as the &quot;Metro Times&quot; and &quot;Real Detroit Weekly&quot;). The change from broadsheet to tabloid scheduled for October took place with the October 3-9 issue.

=== The 2010s ===
Starting in May 2013, The South End&#x27;s budget was cut by nearly 50 percent. Although the newspaper continues to employ students as editors, it publishes in print only once per month, although a PDF version is published on its website weekly. In addition, the positions of multimedia and design editor were merged, one news editor position was terminated, and one copy editor position was transformed into that of online editor.

== Administration ==
The editor-in-chief is a student, usually an upperclassman, who is selected annually and traditionally enjoys some autonomy in staffing and editorial decision-making. The editor-in-chief appoints his or her own managing editor, section editors, copy editors, design editor and multimedia editor; choices must be approved by the university&#x27;s Student Newspaper Publication Board.

This board consists of six student members appointed by the Student Senate and three members appointed by the university president. According to the SNPB charter, the administration&#x27;s appointees include one working journalist, preferably an alumnus/a of the WSU journalism program, a faculty member from the Department of Communication, and a financial professional from the university&#x27;s operations division. The advisor to the paper and the editor-in-chief serve in (non-voting) ex-officio capacity. The board is responsible for oversight of the paper, particularly its budget and major expenditures and contracts, and for selecting its editor each year. A board chair (and vice chair) are elected by the members from the student members. The university administration hired a full-time professional general manager for the paper in 2004 but decided to discontinue the service for FY 2008.

Currently, advertising is handled by a student ad manager in the Dean of Students Office.

<text>Willie James Wells (August 10, 1906 – January 22, 1989), nicknamed &quot;the Devil&quot;, was an American baseball player. He was a shortstop who played from 1924 to 1948 for various teams in the Negro leagues and in Latin America.

Wells was a fast base-runner who hit for both power and average. He was at his finest with his glove, committing almost no errors and having the speed to run down anything that came in his direction. He is widely considered the best black shortstop of his day. He also taught Jackie Robinson how to turn a double play.

Wells was also notable as being the first player to use a batting helmet, after being hit and receiving a concussion while playing with the Newark Eagles (his first helmet was a construction helmet).

Wells is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

On February 5, 2022 the baseball field at Anderson High School in Austin, Texas was dedicated in Wells&#x27; honor. The celebration included members of the Wells family with the keynote presentation by Bob Kendrick, President of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

==Early life==
Wells was born in Austin, Texas. He attended Anderson High School in Austin. Wells first played professional baseball in 1923, playing one season for the Austin Black Senators of the Texas Colored League, a minor league for the Negro National League. He briefly attended Samuel Huston College in Austin before he was called up to the St. Louis team in the NNL.

==Negro league career==
After a short stint with the St. Louis Giants, he entered the NNL with the St. Louis Stars in 1924, playing for the Stars through 1931, when both the team and league folded after the 1931 season. In 1926 he hit 27 home runs, a Negro leagues single-season record. In 1930, he led the Negro National League in home runs (seventeen), runs batted in (114), and batting average (.411) to win the batting Triple Crown; he was the fourth player to achieve the distinction. From 1932 to 1935 he played for the Chicago American Giants and played for the Newark Eagles from 1936 to 1939. While with the Eagles, Wells was part of the &quot;Million Dollar Infield,&quot; consisting of Wells, Ray Dandridge, Dick Seay, and Mule Suttles.

He played in Mexico in 1940 and 1941, where he said he experienced democracy, acceptance and freedom. Wells was nicknamed &quot;El Diablo&quot; by Mexican fans for his extraordinary intensity and the English translation (&quot;The Devil&quot;) followed him as a nickname in the United States. He returned to the Negro leagues in 1942 as a player-manager for the Eagles and then went back to Mexico for the 1943 and 1944 seasons.

Returning to the U.S. in 1945, Wells played for various Negro league teams through the 1950 season, including the Memphis Red Sox where he played alongside his son Willie Wells Jr. in 1948. He then went to Canada as a player-manager for the Winnipeg Buffaloes of the Western Canadian Baseball League, remaining there until his retirement from actively playing baseball in 1954. Wells returned to the U.S. and continued as the manager of the Birmingham Black Barons.

==Later life and legacy==
After his baseball career, Wells was employed at a New York City deli before returning to his birthplace of Austin to look after his mother. He died of congestive heart failure in Austin in 1989. Wells was originally buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Austin, Texas, but was re-interred in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1997 for his play in the Negro leagues. He has also been inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame and Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame.

Known statistics: .319 career batting average, .510 slugging percentage, 98 home runs, 644 runs scored, 399 runs batted in, and 756 games played.

Stella Lee Wells, Willie&#x27;s daughter, created a scholarship fund honoring her father, called the Stella and Willie Wells Scholarship Fund. The fund awards scholarships at Huston–Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.

<doc id="697459" wikidata="Q1673216" url="?curid=697459" title="Probability of error">
<text>In statistics, the term &quot;error&quot; arises in two ways. Firstly, it arises in the context of decision making, where the probability of error may be considered as being the probability of making a wrong decision and which would have a different value for each type of error. Secondly, it arises in the context of statistical modelling (for example regression) where the model&#x27;s predicted value may be in error regarding the observed outcome and where the term probability of error may refer to the probabilities of various amounts of error occurring.

==Hypothesis testing==
In hypothesis testing in statistics, two types of &quot;error&quot; are distinguished.
*Type I errors which consist of rejecting a null hypothesis that is true; this amounts to a false positive result.
*Type II errors which consist of failing to reject a null hypothesis that is false; this amounts to a false negative result.

The probability of error is similarly distinguished. 
* For a Type I error, it is shown as α (alpha) and is known as the &quot;size&quot; of the test and is 1 minus the specificity of the test. This quantity is sometimes referred to as the confidence of the test, or the level of significance (LOS) of the test.
* For a Type II error, it is shown as β (beta) and is 1 minus the power or 1 minus the sensitivity of the test.

==Statistical and econometric modelling==
The fitting of many models in statistics and econometrics usually seeks to minimise the difference between observed and predicted or theoretical values. This difference is known as an &quot;error&quot;, though when observed it would be better described as a &quot;residual&quot;.

The error is taken to be a random variable and as such has a probability distribution. Thus distribution can be used to calculate the probabilities of errors with values within any given range.

<text>4065 Meinel, provisional designation , is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten on photographic plates taken by Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory, California. The asteroid was named for American astronomer Aden Meinel.

== Orbit and classification ==

The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,247 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.
A first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1953, extending &quot;Meinel&quot;″s observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Rotation period ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Meinel&quot; measures 3.87 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.270. As of 2016, the asteroid&#x27;s composition, shape and rotation period remains unknown.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

The survey designation &quot;P-L&quot; stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in honor of the American physicist and astronomer Aden Meinel (1922–2011). The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 1992 ().

<text>Free dance is a 20th-century dance form that preceded modern dance. Rebelling against the rigid constraints of classical ballet, Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis (with her work in theater) developed their own styles of free dance and laid the foundations of American modern dance with their choreography and teaching. In Europe, Rudolf Laban, Emile Jaques-Dalcroze and François Delsarte developed their own theories of human movement and methods of instruction that led to the development of European modern and Expressionist dance.

Free dance was prolific in Central and Eastern Europe, where national schools were created, such as the School of Musical Movement (Heptachor), in Russia, and the Orkesztika School, in Hungary.

Josh Owings added much to the style of Free dance in North America. His style revolved around swift body movements combined with passionate facial expressions. 

Another pioneer of the art was Andrew Saah. He created the &quot;flying chinaman&quot; move that introduced a distinct sect of Asian males to Free dance liberation movement.

==Characteristics== 
Compared to other dance styles, free dance is regarded by artists, including Isadora Duncan, as a natural dance style.

<text>The East Belfast Observer first appeared on 4 March 2004, and after failing to increase circulation above 2000 copies per week, ceased publication following the edition published on Thursday 16 June 2005. The paper was distributed through newsagents throughout east Belfast and North Down, costing 50p per copy.

Published weekly by East Belfast Publishing Ltd, the newspaper was relatively weak on news in comparison to regional papers. The news agenda was focussed on local issues in the various communities of east Belfast with a particular focus on politics and followed a broadly unionist editorial.

The paper covered local sport under sports editor, Chris Holt. Coverage of the local football team Glentoran F.C. was particularly strong. Other sport covered by the newspaper included golf, rugby, hockey, pool and notable support of youth sport.

Funding of approximately £250,000 had been raised to launch the newspaper, from the EU sponsored Peace &amp; Reconciliation funding, but when this funding came to an end, and with the business not generating enough income from sales and advertising to meet costs, the newspaper closed. Attempts had been made to save the paper, firstly by cutting costs including staff, and then by seeking further investment, but this was not forthcoming.

The &quot;East Belfast Observer&quot; was owned by East Belfast Partnership.

<text>Arromanches-les-Bains (; or simply Arromanches) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region of north-western France.

==Geography==
Arromanches-les-Bains is 12 km north-east of Bayeux and 10 km west of Courseulles-sur-Mer on the coast where the Normandy landings took place on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Access to the commune is by the D514 road from Tracy-sur-Mer in the west passing through the town and continuing to Saint-Côme-de-Fresné in the east. The D87 road also goes from the town south to Ryes. The D65 road goes east to Meuvaines. About a third of the commune is the urban area of the town with the rest farmland.

==History==
Arromanches is remembered as a historic place of the Normandy landings and in particular as the place where a Mulberry harbour artificial port was installed. This artificial port allowed the disembarkation of 9,000 tons of materiel per day.

It was on the beach of Arromanches that, during the Invasion of Normandy immediately after D-Day, the Allies established an artificial temporary harbour to allow the unloading of heavy equipment without waiting for the conquest of deep water ports such as Le Havre or Cherbourg. Although at the centre of the Gold Beach landing zone, Arromanches was spared the brunt of the fighting on D-Day so the installation and operation of the port could proceed as quickly as possible without damaging the beach and destroying surrounding lines of communication. The port was commissioned on 14 June 1944.

This location was one of two sites chosen to establish the necessary port facilities to unload quantities of supplies and troops needed for the invasion during June 1944, the other being built further west at Omaha Beach. The British built huge floating concrete caissons which, after being towed from England, then had to be assembled to form walls and piers forming and defining the artificial port called the Mulberry harbour. These comprised pontoons linked to the land by floating roadways. One of these ports was assembled at Arromanches and even today sections of the Mulberry harbour still remain with huge concrete blocks sitting on the sand and more can be seen further out at sea.

Some key figures: by 12 June 1944 more than 300,000 men, 54,000 vehicles, 104,000 tons of supplies had been landed. During 100 days of operation of the port 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of materiel were landed. The best performance of the port was in the last week of July 1944: during those seven days the traffic through Arromanches exceeded 136,000 tons or 20,000 tons per day.

Today, Arromanches is mainly a tourist town. Situated in a good location for visiting all of the battle sites and war cemeteries, there is also a museum at Arromanches with information about Operation Overlord and in particular, the Mulberry harbours.

On 21 September 2013 Bradford-based sand sculpting company &quot;Sand in Your Eye&quot; created a tribute called &quot;The Fallen 9,000&quot;. It was a temporary sculpture project—a visual representation of 9,000 people drawn in the sand which equates the number of civilians, German forces and Allies that died during the D-day landings. It coincided with Peace Day, and was washed away with the tide at the end of the day.

<text>Steerpike is a fictional character in Mervyn Peake&#x27;s novels &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and &quot;Gormenghast&quot;.

==Character==
Steerpike might be called the antagonist of the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; trilogy, but in truth he is more of an anti-hero; the first book for example is largely focused on him, only covering the first year of the eponymous hero Titus&#x27;s life. Steerpike could also be considered an archetypal Machiavellian schemer: a highly intelligent, ruthless character willing to justify any and all means to reach his end. In the books, Mervyn Peake describes his personality as follows:
if ever he had harboured a conscience in his tough narrow breast he had by now dug out and flung away the awkward thing — flung it so far away that were he ever to need it again he could never find it. High-shouldered to a degree little short of malformation, slender and adroit of limb and frame, his eyes close-set and the colour of dried blood, he is climbing the spiral staircase of the soul of Gormenghast, bound for some pinnacle of the itching fancy — some wild, invulnerable eyrie best known to himself; where he can watch the world spread out below him, and shake exultantly his clotted wings.

And his appearance, as described in &quot;Titus Groan&quot;:
Limb by limb, it appeared that he was sound enough, but the sum of these several members accrued to an unexpectedly twisted total. His face was pale like clay and save for his eyes, mask-like. These eyes were set very close together, and were small, dark red, and of startling concentration.

==Steerpike&#x27;s fictional path==
===Escape from the kitchen===
Steerpike first appears as a youth of seventeen years with an unclear past, working in Gormenghast&#x27;s Great Kitchen under the chef Abiatha Swelter, whom he hates. On the day that Titus, 77th Earl of Gormenghast, is born, Steerpike escapes from the kitchen after Swelter collapses from drink. He is discovered by the chief retainer of the castle, Flay, and locked in a small room. Steerpike escapes through the window and climbs over the vast roofscape of Gormenghast, spending the night in a great stone square, before arriving by accident in the attic of Fuchsia, daughter to the Earl of Gormenghast.

===The fire===
Steerpike uses his charm and fast tongue to insinuate himself with the castle&#x27;s physician Dr Prunesquallor, and acts for a time as his apprentice. From there Steerpike uses the doctor&#x27;s connections to gain access to the upper hierarchy of Gormenghast. Shortly afterwards he starts to work for the simpleton sisters of the Earl, the twins Cora and Clarice, manipulating them with appeals to their vanity and desire for power (they believed that the Countess had usurped their rightful position beside their brother). He persuades them to set fire to Sepulchrave&#x27;s Library and uses the circumstances to play the hero in rescuing those trapped inside (including all the surviving members of the House of Groan). Sourdust, the Master of Ritual, dies and Steerpike hopes to take his place, but like so many offices in the castle the position is hereditary and is succeeded by Sourdust&#x27;s son Barquentine, a crippled and fiercely traditional man.

===Banishment of Flay===
The library was Sepulchrave&#x27;s only joy in life and its loss breaks his spirit, leading to madness and eventual suicide. During this period, Steerpike unintentionally causes the removal of the Earl&#x27;s manservant, Mr. Flay, who had always been suspicious of him. Steerpike enrages the manservant, who throws one of the Countess&#x27;s precious white cats at the youth; Flay is subsequently banished. His resultant vendetta against Steerpike becomes a key factor in Steerpike&#x27;s eventual downfall.

===The Twins===
Deciding to remove the twins, Steerpike convinces them to move into a distant and abandoned region of the castle by confabulating an epidemic of &quot;Weasel Plague&quot;, which they must be quarantined from. He then explains their disappearance to the inhabitants of the castle with a suicide note (including a confession to arson) and wax models of the Twins (helped by the fact that the half-paralyzed twins were hardly more animated than wax-works in real life).

===Master of Ritual===
Steerpike then insinuates himself into Barquentine&#x27;s work, acting as apprentice and doing his best to make himself indispensable. When he considers the time ripe, he attempts to kill Barquentine by fire, but botches the attempt, underestimating the seemingly frail and disabled old man. Although aflame and dying, Barquentine clings to Steerpike in an attempt to take his murderer with him. Steerpike jumps from the nearest window into the moat below and drowns Barquentine. Steerpike nearly loses his own life in the process, but uses this to his advantage, claiming that the jump into the moat was a desperate attempt to save his master from the fire. The incident, however, leaves Steerpike permanently scarred; his face now red and blotched. The fire and injury also appears to cause changes in his personality, namely a distinct fear of fire and an increasing loss of rationality. The plan succeeds, however, and the death of Barquentine leads to him being appointed Master of Ritual.

===Discovery===
At approximately this time the Twins die of starvation in their remote room; locked away they were completely dependent on Steerpike for supplies, but he ceased to visit them when they attempted to kill him and escape. Steerpike of course realizes that they must have died, but it is only after several years as Master of Ritual that he finds time to bother to confirm their deaths (during which time, among other things, he attempts to woo Fuchsia). Unfortunately for him he is followed to their room by Flay, Doctor Prunesquallor, and Titus and is discovered with the corpses. His behaviour at this point shows evident signs of madness, in stark contrast to the cool and rational mastermind he once was.

With his crimes exposed, Steerpike flees and for a short while terrorizes the castle, using his intimate knowledge of its layout and extensive passageways to evade capture. Matters are brought to a head when a huge rainstorm floods the castle, submerging the lower levels and forcing the inhabitants (and Steerpike) higher and higher. Although he evades the Countess&#x27;s forces, Titus, who blamed Steerpike for his sister&#x27;s death, eventually finds and kills him.

==Appearances in other media==
Stefan Vinzberg portrayed the character in the opera adaptation, and he was played by Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers in the BBC miniseries.

Sting played Steerpike in 1984 radio adaption of the first two Gormenghast novels on BBC Radio 4.

==Reception==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has described Steerpike as one of the greatest villains in English literature. They also proposed that post-war readers were not prepared to fully appreciate the character upon his initial appearance.

<text>Andrew Damien Wilkie (born 8 November 1961) is an Australian politician and independent federal member for Clark (previously Denison). Before entering politics Wilkie was an infantry officer in the Australian Army.

Wilkie served with the Australian Army from 1980 to 2004. An officer with the Royal Australian Infantry Corps who had earlier commanded a company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, at the time of his entry to public life Wilkie was posted to Australia&#x27;s Office of National Assessments as an intelligence analyst. In 2003, in the lead-up to the Iraq War, he resigned from his position at ONA because he feared the humanitarian consequences of invasion, such as Saddam Hussein using his weapons of mass destruction or assisting terrorists.

Following his resignation he said: Iraq&#x27;s &quot;weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that&#x27;s been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.&quot; He opposed Australia&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the Howard government. Wilkie later argued the Iraq War was based on a &quot;lie&quot;.

Wilkie has been active in politics since 2003. He was a Greens candidate for the federal Division of Bennelong in the 2004 federal election and for the Senate in Tasmania at the 2007 federal election. In 2010 he stood as an independent candidate for the state seat of Denison at the Tasmanian state election, narrowly missing out on the final vacancy. Later in the year, again as an independent candidate, he ran for the federal seat of Denison at the 2010 federal election and won, finishing third on the primary vote but winning the seat after the distribution of preferences. Wilkie finished first on the primary vote at both the 2013 federal election and 2016 federal election, increasing his margin each time. In 2019, the Division of Denison was replaced by the Division of Clark, to which Wilkie was transferred. He retained the seat at the 2022 Australian federal election by a margin of 20.82%.

==Early life and education==
Wilkie attended St Gregory&#x27;s College, Campbelltown and later trained at the Royal Military College, Duntroon and graduated in 1984. He joined the Young Liberals while a cadet. He also studied at the University of New South Wales, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree, a Graduate Diploma of Management, and a Graduate Diploma of Defence Studies. After graduation and being stationed in Brisbane, he joined the Liberal Party before allowing his membership to lapse. His military career spanned 1980–2001 and he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was seconded to the ONA, an Australian intelligence agency, from 1999 until late 2000. After a stint with US defence company Raytheon, Wilkie returned to the ONA shortly after the September 11 attacks.

==Military career, 1980–2003==
Wilkie joined the Army in 1980, and was first stationed in Brisbane, Queensland. He served in the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was discharged in 2001.

===Opposition to Iraq War===
In the aftermath of the September 11 Terror Attacks, the United States called upon Australia to assist in enforcing the 1991 Gulf War peace treaty which had been repeatedly breached by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. Iraq failed to comply with demands to allow unfettered arms inspections, and the Howard government elected to send forces to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While the Government was considering the case for war, Wilkie was asked to report on humanitarian considerations. According to a leaked report published in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, in December 2002 Wilkie submitted to the government an Office of National Assessments report on the humanitarian implications of war in Iraq. In the report he cautioned against unpredictable and potentially serious humanitarian consequences of war with Iraq, such as the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians.

In response to widespread opposition to the war, Wilkie gave extensive television interviews and accepted numerous offers of public speaking engagements. He subsequently gave evidence to official British and Australian inquiries into the government&#x27;s case for involvement in the Iraq war. In 2004, Wilkie published &quot;Axis of Deceit&quot;, an account of the reasons for his decision and its results. He describes his views on the nature of intelligence agencies and the analyst&#x27;s work, the history of the Iraq war, the untruths of politicians and the attempts to suppress the truth.

Following Britain&#x27;s 2016 Chilcot Report which criticised the Blair Government&#x27;s prosecution of the war, Wilkie said that Howard, Bush and Blair should be brought before an international court, and called for Australia to hold another inquiry into the war. Howard rejected Wilkie&#x27;s proposition and called him &quot;irrational&quot;, telling the media: &quot;Andrew Wilkie said the Iraq invasion was responsible for the Bali attack of 2005. What about the Bali attack of 2002? And he blamed it [the Iraq War] on the Lindt Cafe siege. I mean, this is irrational.&quot;

===Resignation from ONA (2003)===
On 11 March 2003, Wilkie resigned from the ONA, stating that while it was likely that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction, its program in this area was contained, that international sanctions were having an effect, and therefore an invasion was premature and also reckless in potentially provoking Saddam Hussein to use those weapons and possibly even begin supporting terrorism. He told the ABC: &quot;I think that invading Iraq at this time would be wrong. For a start, Iraq does not pose a security threat to any other country at this point in time. Its military is very weak, it&#x27;s a fraction of the size of the military at the time of the invasion of Kuwait. Its weapons of mass destruction program is very disjointed and contained by the regime that&#x27;s been in place since the last Gulf War. And there is no hard intelligence linking the Iraqi regime to al-Qaeda in any substantial or worrisome way.&quot; Wilkie later told the press that in the lead up to his resignation he had increasingly encountered ethical conflict between his duty as an intelligence officer and his &quot;respect for the truth&quot;. In 2016, after appearing at the Chilcot enquiry, Wilkie said the notion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and co-operated with terrorists had been &quot;a lie ... No wonder John Howard and Tony Blair and George W Bush do stand accused of war crimes&quot;. He linked the 2005 Bali bombings and the 2014 Lindt Cafe siege to Australia&#x27;s participation in the invasion of Iraq.

==Political career, 2004–present==
===Candidacy for Australian Greens (2004–2008)===

Wilkie became a member of the Australian Greens by 2004, and stood as their candidate for the seat of Bennelong in that year&#x27;s federal election, running against sitting Prime Minister John Howard. He was a supporter of the &#x27;Not happy, John!&#x27; campaign which ran during the election campaign. Polling 16.37% of the primary vote, Wilkie achieved the fifth-highest vote percentage for a Greens candidate across the nation at the time. This result was a considerable increase from the Greens&#x27; previous election result in Bennelong of 4.03%. Although Wilkie&#x27;s vote was nowhere near enough to win the seat, there was an overall swing of 3.18% against Howard, who achieved a primary vote of only 49.89%, which resulted in the seat being decided on preferences.

Wilkie did not run again for Bennelong in the 2007 federal election, instead running as the Greens&#x27; second Tasmanian candidate for the Australian Senate, behind the party&#x27;s federal leader, Bob Brown. He was not elected.

He resigned from the party in 2008, criticising it for a lack of professionalism.

===Member of Parliament (2010–present)===

; Gillard–Rudd government
Wilkie stood as an independent candidate in the state Division of Denison, based around central Hobart, in the 2010 Tasmanian state election. He won 8.44 per cent of first preference votes, and was beaten by 315 votes by Liberal candidate Elise Archer after distribution of preferences.

Wilkie stood as an independent for the federal Division of Denison, which has the same boundaries as the state division, in the 2010 federal election and won more than 20 per cent of the primary vote. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation declared Wilkie the winner on election night, predicting that Wilkie would be vaulted into second place on Green preferences and ultimately take the seat on Liberal preferences. On the third count, he picked up enough Green preferences to put him in second place, ahead of the Liberal candidate. On the fourth count, more than 79 percent of the Liberal candidate&#x27;s preferences flowed to Wilkie, allowing him to win the seat with just over 51 per cent of the two-candidate-preferred vote. Reportedly, Wilkie benefited from what was perceived to have been a lacklustre campaign by Labor&#x27;s candidate, Jonathan Jackson, the son of former longtime state Labor minister Judy Jackson; Labor lost almost a quarter of its primary vote from 2007, and Labor theoretically tallied a two-party vote of more than 65 percent.

Following the election, he declared that he would back the Labor minority government, in return for Julia Gillard&#x27;s administration committing $340 million to the Royal Hobart Hospital and a commitment to reduce problem gambling. In contrast the Coalition offered A$1 billion in funding for the same hospital in their offer to Wilkie, which was perceived by Wilkie as &quot;almost reckless&quot;. Wilkie described this as being part of the evidence that Labor would better be able to offer a more stable, competent and ethical government than the Coalition. The agreement to support the government only extended to issues of supply and no confidence motions.

Wilkie was unexpectedly admitted to hospital on 12 November 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. This did not interfere with his ability to attend Parliamentary sittings and he was present at the debate on same-sex marriage on 15 November, where he seconded the motion raised by Greens member Adam Bandt.

In April 2011, during push for gambling reform initiated by Wilkie, News Limited media reported allegations by a former Duntroon army cadet that in 1983 Wilkie had forced junior cadets to salute to Adolf Hitler on the 50th anniversary of the latter&#x27;s rise to power. In response, Wilkie said he had been &quot;involved in bastardisation of teenage army cadets&quot; at Duntroon during the 1980s, and apologised for this &quot;inappropriate behaviour&quot;, but could not recall the specific incident alleged. With regard to the allegation and its publication, he accused pro-Pokies advocates of running a smear campaign against him.

On 21 January 2012, Wilkie announced that he was withdrawing his support for the Labor government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Julia Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government&#x27;s alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie&#x27;s preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically infeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified. In making his announcement, Wilkie stated that he would only support motions of no confidence against the government &quot;in the event of serious misconduct&quot; and would &quot;consider budget measures on their merits&quot;.

; Abbott-Turnbull government

Wilkie was re-elected in the 2013 federal election, gaining a swing of 15 points to increase his majority to 65 percent.

In October 2014, Wilkie wrote to the International Criminal Court, seeking to prosecute Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the 19 members of his cabinet for crimes against humanity, with particular concerns relating to the treatment of asylum seekers.

; Morrison government
In February 2020, Wilkie and fellow MP George Christensen travelled to the UK to meet Australian Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Both MPs called for Assange to be released.

==Political views==

In the 2010 Tasmanian state election, Wilkie made the removal of poker machines his primary campaign issue. He strongly opposed the Gunns pulp mill in the Tamar Valley. Wilkie is a supporter of voluntary euthanasia, provided that there are safeguards in place. He is also in favour of same-sex marriage and access to abortion. He supported a National Broadband Network, and also opposed the Howard government&#x27;s WorkChoices industrial relations reforms.

During Wilkie&#x27;s maiden speech to federal parliament on 30 September 2010, he called for withdrawal of Australian troops from Afghanistan. He said Australia should be more willing to say &quot;no&quot; more often to the United States, and that there could be no hope for peace in Afghanistan until foreign troops are withdrawn: &quot;No-one should be fooled by the Australian Government&#x27;s periodic efforts to tinker around the edges with Australia&#x27;s commitment to Afghanistan&quot; and that &quot;The reality is that the best plan the Australian Government can come up with so far is simply to continue to support whatever the US Government comes up with and that alone is no plan—it&#x27;s just reinforcing failure.&quot;

Wilkie&#x27;s comments came amid opposition calls for more support for Australia&#x27;s troops in Afghanistan. During his speech Wilkie also canvassed his push for legislation to protect whistleblowers, measures to tackle problem gambling and a more humane approach to asylum seekers.

In March 2011, he called Liberal MPs Cory Bernardi and Scott Morrison &quot;a disgrace to high office&quot;, calling on party leader Tony Abbott to sack them both. In a speech to the House of Representatives, he spoke of the &quot;racism that eats at the Liberal Party&quot;.

===Pokies and pre-commitment===
Wilkie campaigned heavily against poker machines (colloquially &quot;pokies&quot;) at the 2010 federal election, and immediately began forging ties with independent anti-pokies Senator Nick Xenophon. Wilkie claimed that problem gamblers in Australia lose $5 billion each year on pokies. The Labor government gave two commitments regarding pokies in exchange for Wilkie&#x27;s support. The first was mandatory &quot;pre-commitment&quot; technology, which required a better to commit how much they were willing to bet before starting. The second commitment was to introduce $1 maximum bet per spin machines that would not require pre-commitment. Wilkie argued these $1 maximum machines would be safer. The Abbott Coalition opposed the plans, with Abbott saying &quot;it is not Liberal Party policy&quot; and it will be &quot;expensive and ineffective&quot;. According to polling, Wilkie&#x27;s proposals were supported by a clear majority of voters across the spectrum. Wilkie and Xenophon argued that &quot;$12 billion a year is lost on the pokies. 100,000 Australians are problem gamblers and an additional 200,000 are significantly at risk of developing a full-blown addiction&quot;, and that the legislation is necessary to &quot;[help] those who sometimes lose up to $1200 an hour on the pokies.&quot; The Labor government withdrew their promised support for Wilkies&#x27;s plan when their strength in parliament improved through a change of Speaker.

The plan came under sustained attack from clubs, hotels and other businesses which financially benefit from pokies. Xenophon responded by accusing them of misrepresenting plans and creating hype around the issue. Strategy papers erroneously placed on the Clubs Queensland public website seemed to indicate that clubs were deliberately and purposefully exaggerating the impact that the pre-commitment reforms will have on their services. The same papers outlined some strategies that the clubs could use to exploit loopholes in the proposed reform.

The National Rugby League (NRL) aligned themselves with the campaign in opposing the pre-commitment plans, as did some prominent Australian Football League (AFL) people. Commentators from the Nine Network gave planned political arguments without disclosure during commentary of a Semi-final NRL game, prompting the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to investigate, stating &quot;Channel Nine broadcast political material without adequately identifying it as such during the NRL first preliminary final&quot;. One of the accused commentators stated that the remarks were a &quot;directive from up top that it be read by at least somebody&quot;. Investigations were predicted to take months. Andrew Demetriou, chief executive officer of the AFL, rejected suggestions that the AFL was joining Clubs Australia in their media campaign despite opposition to the plan by Collingwood president Eddie McGuire. Other high-profile club bosses including Jeff Kennett (Hawthorn) and David Smorgon (Bulldogs), and also stated &quot;The fellow from Clubs Australia, I don&#x27;t even know his name, but please, stop talking on our behalf, just shut up, that&#x27;d be a good help&quot;. Activist group GetUp! attempted to counter the anti-pre-commitment campaign by running political commercials during the NRL grand final but all three major commercial television stations refused to air more of them.

On the 28th of November, Wilkie introduced a bill targeting loot boxes in video games, stating they &quot;[groom children] for future gambling&quot;. The bill would make all games targeting at children that include any form of in-game gambling be mandatorally rated R18+, restricting their purchase to exclusively adults.

==Personal life==
Wilkie was married to a fellow army officer Simone Wilkie (née Burt) from 1991 to 2003.

He married Kate (now Charlie) Burton in 2004, with whom he has two daughters. However, they separated in 2012 and divorced the following year, with Wilkie citing stress from the 2010–2013 hung parliament as the main cause of the breakdown.

Wilkie became engaged to Clare Ballingall in late 2018, and the pair married in June 2020.

<text>The Animation Show is a touring festival of animated short films that was first held in fall 2003. It was sponsored by MTV, and was created by award-winning animators Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt. 

Following the demise of other American touring festivals of animation, such as Spike and Mike&#x27;s Classic Festival of Animation, the stated purpose of the &quot;Animation Show&quot; was to bring animated short films back into proper cinemas, where most of them were intended to be seen, and to &quot;free these artists from the dungeons of Internet exhibition&quot;. It was the first-ever festival of animation to be curated by working animators and was described as a &quot;passion project&quot; by its creators, not something intended to turn a giant profit. A sister series of &quot;Animation Show&quot; DVD volumes are also available from MTV Home Video and Paramount Home Entertainment, but the producers stress that the theatrical and DVD lineups are intentionally a little bit different, to encourage audiences to not just wait for the DVD but to visit the cinema and view these films properly. As stated on the &quot;Animation Show&quot; programs and flyers, once the current edition of the Show is out of theaters, it&#x27;s &quot;gone forever&quot;.

Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt programmed the first three &quot;Animation Show&quot; programs together. Don Hertzfeldt parted ways with the festival in 2008 and the fourth season of &quot;the Animation Show&quot; was released without his involvement.

==History==
===2003===
The first season&#x27;s 2003 tour visited over 200 North American theaters with occasional appearances from the producers (Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt) and Q&amp;A&#x27;s with many of the award-winning filmmakers involved. The program included &quot;everything from forgotten classics to the very latest in computer animation&quot;. This included many current Academy Award nominees, as well as the restoration of a 5-minute excerpt from Ward Kimball&#x27;s 1957 Disney film, &quot;Mars and Beyond&quot;. The tour concluded with the DVD release of &quot;Animation Show, Volume One&quot;.

=== 2005 ===
The second &quot;Animation Show&quot; toured throughout 2005, featuring Bill Plympton&#x27;s &quot;Guard Dog&quot;, the 1999 National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s classic &quot;When the Day Breaks&quot;, Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; and new films by animators Peter Cornwell, Georges Schwizgebel and PES.

=== 2007 ===
The third season of &quot;The Animation Show&quot; began its nationwide release in January 2007, featuring the return of Mike Judge&#x27;s &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. The third tour also showcased new work by animators Joanna Quinn, PES, Bill Plympton, and Don Hertzfeldt.

=== 2008 ===
The fourth &quot;Animation Show&quot; was released in 2008. It included new work by animators PES, Bill Plympton and Georges Schwizgebel as well as the Academy Award nominated short &quot;This Way Up&quot;.

<text>Echinops is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, commonly known as globe [[thistle]]s. They have spiny foliage and produce blue or white spherical flower heads. They are distributed from central Asia, Mongolia and north-eastern China to the Mediterranean basin, temperate regions of Eurasia, reaching to Indian subcontinent and tropical Africa. Globe thistle is the host plant of weevils &quot;Larinus vulpes&quot; and &quot;Larinus onopordi.&quot;

== Characteristics ==

Source:

=== Vegetative charactreistic ===

<text>Unterschleißheim (, , in contrast to &quot;Upper Schleißheim&quot;; ) is a town in Bavaria, Germany. It is located about 17 km north of Munich central, and has a resident population of 29,464 (December 31, 2021).

==History==
Originally, the area was called Schleissheim (&quot;Sleizheim&quot;) for centuries. Not until the 19th Century was it divided into (upper) Oberschleissheim and (lower) Unterschleissheim for population and political reasons. The small hamlet of Mittenheim lay between the two communities. 

There is evidence that the area was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age. Remnents of a road marker and a Villa Rustica were found from the Roman Era.

The first surviving document in which Schleißheim is mentioned comes from the year 785 AD in which Rihpalt von Slivesheim donated his estate to the diocese of Freising. The hamlet “Schleyßaim” was already a village as early as the 12th century.

The small church of St. Martin in Mallertshofen, (a Romanesque church) was built in the Schleissheim area in the first half of the 13th century. 

The catholic church building of St. Ulrich was first built in 1518. 
The community suffered heavy losses during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-48).

The Palace Complex in Schleissheim was built over a period of 130 years, (from the 1590s by the Dukes of Bavaria, to the 1720s by the Electors of Bavaria). The palace was mostly used as a summer residence for the Bavarian rulers of the House of Wittelsbach. 

As part of the administrative reforms in Bavaria in 1818, Unterschleissheim became an independent political community, (thus separated from the community of Oberschleissheim with its Palace Complex).

From 1856 to 1858 the first railway line from Munich to Landshut passed through Unterschleissheim, with a station in the nearby village of Lohhof. 
During the late 19th century, the area between Unterschleissheim and Dachau was considered a &#x27;Painter&#x27;s Paradise&#x27; for nature artists. 
Painters and illustrators such as Otto Hupp, Frank Behrens, Max Hein-Neufeld and Heinz Katzenberger should be mentioned.

During the Nazi Era, a forced labor facility was built in Lohhof to grow and process flax for the textile industry. About 300 women were forced to work here until the facility was destroyed by the Americans during the Liberation of Dachau and Munich in 1945.

After 1945, the community&#x27;s population grew dramatically. Many apartment buildings and industries have been developed since then.
The city was given an official coat of arms in 1965.

In 1979 and 1980, the Autobahn (A92) was constructed just west of Unterschleissheim.

==City Symbol==
Unterschleißheim&#x27;s coat of arms symbolises the city&#x27;s past and present. The shield of the coat of arms is divided. The upper part shows a golden zigzag line on a blue background. The lower part incorporates a green branch of a spruce and a green oak leaf on a golden background.

==Industry==
Unterschleissheim is home to several large industries such as Baxter International, Linde Gas AG, Baader Bank AG, EDAG Engineering GmbH, Orterer Gruppe and Keller &amp; Kalmbach.
It was also the former home to Microsoft Germany from the 1980s until it moved to Munich in 2016. The European aerospace conglomerate EADS also had facilities in Unterschleissheim before they closed in 2013.

==Recreation==

Lake Unterschleißheim was created from 1979–1980 by extracting fill to build the Autobahn (A92). Over the past 3 decades it has become an almost natural lake, with an ecologically balanced zone, a conservation area for seabirds during the nesting season, and a damp biotop covering of land, of which roughly is used for sunbathing. With numerous shallow areas this is a popular summer gathering area for families with children, and used frequently for ice skating and curling in the winter.

The “Valentinspark”, covering roughly which was made possible at the instigation of former mayor Rolf Zeitler and opened on July 22nd, 2000, was rededicated on January 12th, 2024 as “Rudolf-Zeitler-Park”, in memory of him and his achievements. 

==Transport== 
Unterschleissheim is nestled between two major roads and an autobahn, forming a rough triangular border formation: the Autobahn (A92) to the west, the Federal Road (B13) to the east and the Federal Road (B471) to the south. The Autobahn (A92) gives direct access to the Munich Airport Franz Josef Strauß. Two S-Bahn stations on the Munich–Regensburg line, served by S1 trains, connect Unterschleißheim with the regional rail system.

A bridge crosses over the S-Bahn line in the middle of Unterschleißheim, called the Le Cres Brücke (named in honor of their sister city in France).

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Unterschleißheim is twinned with:
* Le Crès, France
* Zengőalja (microregion), Hungary

<text>Henry Holiday (17 June 183915 April 1927) was an English Victorian painter of historical genre and landscapes, also a stained-glass designer, illustrator, and sculptor. He was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, many of whom he knew.

==Life==
===Early years and training===

Holiday was born in London. He showed an early aptitude for art and was given lessons by William Cave Thomas. He attended Leigh&#x27;s art academy (where a fellow student was Frederick Walker) and in 1855, at the age of 15, was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. Through his friendship with Albert Moore and Simeon Solomon he was introduced to the artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. This movement was to be pivotal in his future artistic and political life.
In the same year, 1855, Holiday made a journey to the Lake District. This was to be the first of many trips to the area, where he would often holiday for long periods of time. Whilst there, he spent much of his time sketching the views which were to be seen from the various hills and mountains. He wrote, &quot;For concentrated loveliness, I know nothing that can quite compare with the lakes and mountains of Westmorland, Cumberland and Lancashire&quot;.

===Paintings===
Holiday worked in both oils and watercolours. In 1858, his first picture, a landscape painting, was exhibited at the Royal Academy and immediately sold; from that year his work was frequently shown at the Academy and elsewhere. Other pictures include:

* &quot;The Burgess of Calais&quot; (1859).
* &quot;The Bride and the Daughters of Jerusalem&quot; (1861–63). In his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, Holiday explains that the painting was &#x27;more ambitious than anything I had hitherto undertaken&#x27;. It showed the daughters of Jerusalem asking the Bride where her Beloved had gone (see Song of Solomon 6:1) and stood at 4 feet 6 inches by 3 feet, containing seven figures (including a little girl) and a full background of foliage. He began work on it among the scenery of North Wales in 1861 but in 1863 it was rejected by the Royal Academy selection committee, unlike his two previous figure paintings. Holiday described this as &#x27;a heavy blow&#x27; but &#x27;the rejections this year were of so extraordinary a character, and the show of the work on the walls was so poor, that there was a general storm of indignation&#x27; (&quot;Reminiscences&quot; p 95). At the suggestion of Holman Hunt, a number of rejected paintings were exhibited instead at the Cosmopolitan Club, which attracted attention and acclaim from visitors including William Makepeace Thackeray (p. 96). James McNeill Whistler singled out Holiday&#x27;s painting and said &quot;Do you mean to say they rejected that!&quot;. Richard Redgrave, himself a member of the Royal Academy, attempted to apologise for and explain the Royal Academy&#x27;s selection, saying &#x27;You know they can&#x27;t hang everything that comes in higgledy-piggledy&#x27;; to which Whistler replied &#x27;Why, what do you call your present exhibition, isn&#x27;t that higgledy – and &quot;particularly&quot; piggledy?&#x27; (p. 96). The painting was bought from the artist by Thomas Milward Kitchin, later of Great Down in Seale, Surrey, but has now disappeared. There is, however, a full page illustration of it between pp 96–97 of the &quot;Reminiscences&quot;.
* &quot;The Rhine Maidens&quot; (1879). The subject matter was taken from Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. In order to properly visualise the picture, Holiday modelled the three Rhine maidens in clay and placed them in a tank of blue-green tinted water together with clay &quot;rocks&quot;.
* &quot;Dante and Beatrice&quot;, exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1883. In 1881, Holiday had travelled to Florence in order to make studies for this picture, and carried out meticulous research to ensure that the correct buildings and architectural features were present. He also created rough clay models of some of the buildings to set the scene. The pigeons in the picture were painted by John Trivett Nettleship.
* &quot;Charity&quot;, a stained-glass window design (1887, Royal Academy), &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Sleep&quot;, &quot;The Lute player&quot;, &quot;The Temple of Philae&quot;, &quot;Hawes Water&quot; (1918, watercolour) and many others.

Holiday spent much time at the studios of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, where groups of artists would meet to discuss, exchange and pool ideas. The influence of Burne-Jones can be seen in Holiday&#x27;s work.

===Stained glass===

In 1861, Holiday accepted the position of stained glass window designer for Powell&#x27;s Glass Works, after Burne-Jones had left to work for Morris &amp; Co. During his time there he fulfilled over 300 commissions, mostly for customers in the United States. He left in 1891 to set up his own glass works in Hampstead, producing stained glass, mosaics, enamels and sacerdotal objects.

Holiday&#x27;s stained glass work can be found all over Britain. Some of his best is at the chapel of Worcester College, Oxford (c.1865); Westminster Abbey (the Isambard Kingdom Brunel memorial window, 1868); St Luke&#x27;s Church, Kentish Town; St Mary Magdalene, Paddington (1869); and Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall, Moorgate. In 2018, four of his stained-glass windows were reinstalled in Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall after being lost for almost 50 years following their removal for an extension in 1970.

Examples in the United States of Holiday&#x27;s work may be seen in the sacristy of St. John&#x27;s Chapel, Groton School (Groton, Massachusetts—panels by Holiday repurposed from the School&#x27;s original chapel), and in Grace Church in New York City.
===Other work and personal life===

Holiday also created some sculpture, in 1861 producing a piece called &quot;Sleep&quot; which attracted favourable critical interest.

Holiday worked for architect William Burges for a period, including providing wall and ceiling paintings for Worcester College, Oxford (1863–64) and furniture paintings – including &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; for the headboard in the bedroom – at Burges&#x27;s London home, The Tower House. The &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; bed is now in the collection of the Higgins Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Bedford. Holiday has four oil paintings in British national public collections.

In October 1864, Holiday married Catherine Raven (1839-1924) and they moved to Bayswater, London. His wife was a talented embroiderer who worked for Morris &amp; Co. They had one daughter, Winifred (1866–1949).

In 1867, Holiday visited Italy for the first time and was inspired by the originality of the Renaissance artists he saw on display there. In 1871 he went to Ceylon as part of the &quot;Eclipse Expedition&quot;. His astronomical drawings were subsequently published in the national press and attracted great interest.

On his return to England in 1872, he commissioned architect Basil Champneys to design a new family home in Branch Hill, Hampstead, which was named &quot;Oak Tree House&quot;. In 1888, William Gladstone was a visitor.

In July 1875, Holiday was commissioned by Lewis Carroll to illustrate &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;. He remained a friend of the author throughout his life. Carroll died in 1898. Holiday&#x27;s illustration to the chapter &quot;The Banker&#x27;s Fate&quot; might contain pictorial references to the etching &quot;The Image Breakers&quot; by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, to William Sidney Mount&#x27;s painting &quot;The Bone Player&quot;, and to a photograph by Benjamin Duchenne used for a drawing in Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;.

From 1899, Holiday worked with Jessie Mothersole as studio assistant and she remained closely associated with the family until Holiday&#x27;s death. In 1906 Holiday gave Mothersole a drawing of his daughter Winifred, which later was acquired by the British Museum.

In 1907, Holiday went to Egypt, painting a series of watercolours and illustrations on ancient Egyptian themes. These were exhibited at Walker&#x27;s Gallery, London, in March 1908 jointly with Mothersole who had been working on Egyptian archaeological drawings and watercolours since 1903/4. In 1907–08, he commissioned the building of a holiday home, Betty Fold, in his favourite part of the Lake District.

Between 1912 and 1919 he painted the apse of the east end of St Benedict&#x27;s Church at Small Heath, Birmingham, depicting Christ in Glory with angels, and saints in arcading, below, in Byzantine style.

Holiday had been a socialist throughout his life and, together with his wife Kate and daughter Winifred, supported the Suffragette movement. The family were close acquaintances of Myra Sadd Brown and Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter, and had organised local suffragette meetings in the Lake District.

Holiday died on 15 April 1927 in London, two years after his wife, Catherine. His nephew, Gilbert Holiday (1879–1937), son of Sir Frederick Holiday, was also an artist who also has paintings in British collections.

<doc id="697504" wikidata="Q4668458" url="?curid=697504" title="Abortion in Finland">
<text>Abortion is legal and free of charge upon request in Finland in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy since 1 September 2023. Between 1960 and 2023, abortion was widely accessible in practice for a variety of reasons (including socioeconomic factors), but nevertheless, the law required the pregnant woman to state her motivations and get approval from one or two doctors.

By international standards, political controversy in Finland regarding abortion has been mild, and incidence is low. Abortions in Finland have been decreasing since the 1960s. In 2021, around 7,600 abortions were performed.

==Legal framework==
On 26 October 2022, the Finnish Parliament voted by 125–41 to reform the 1970 abortion law. The reform was initiated by a citizens&#x27; initiative which collected the required 50,000 signatures in 2020 for the issue to be dealt with by lawmakers. The law was modified so that abortion is available upon request, with no restrictions up until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy. After the gestational limit of the first 12 weeks, the bill allows pregnancy to be terminated at the pregnant woman&#x27;s request if continuing the pregnancy or giving birth would endanger her health or life, for example because of illness or disability. The President of the Republic signed the bill into law on 20 December 2022. The law was officially published on 28 December 2022, and went into effect from 1 September 2023.

Prior to this, abortion laws in Finland were among the strictest in the European Union. Approval for an abortion required signatures by one or two physicians, depending on the specifics of the patient&#x27;s case, and in some cases, additional permission from the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira). Additionally, if a woman was impregnated as a result of rape, it could not be used as the reason for abortion if charges had not been prosecuted against the alleged rapist. Therefore, officially, abortion was not legal upon request, though in reality, any pregnant woman got an abortion if it was requested before the 12th week of pregnancy, as the grounds for abortion were numerous.

==History==

In Finland, abortion was illegal until 1950, when the Parliament of Finland legalized abortions to preserve the physical or mental health of the woman, if the woman was under 16, if the fetus might be deformed, or if the woman had been raped. Under pressure from the women&#x27;s liberation movement and supportive editorials from most national newspapers, Finnish law was further liberalized in 1970. The 1970 law allowed abortion up to 16 weeks of pregnancy for broad socio-economic reasons, if the woman was younger than 17, if the woman was older than 40, if the woman had already had four children, or if at least one parent would be unable to raise the child owing to disease or mental disturbance.

The time limit was lowered from 16 to 12 weeks in 1979. The 1970 law also allowed abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in the event of fetal deformity or a physical threat to the woman&#x27;s health. A 1985 bill allowed abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy for under-aged girls, and up to the 24th week if an amniocentesis or ultrasound found serious impairment in the fetus.

In 2008, there were 10,423 abortions in Finland. There has been a gradual decrease in abortions over time, largely attributable to a decrease in the under-20 age group , the abortion rate was 10.4 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years. 

Abortions are provided free of charge in public hospitals. It is illegal to perform abortions in private clinics, though doctors are empowered to provide abortions outside of hospitals in emergency circumstances. Illegal abortions remain very rare because, due to the generality of the conditions specified in the law, in practice, a woman can get an abortion under almost any circumstance.

Political controversy since the 1970 law has been mild. Members of parliament from rightist parties, notably the Finns Party, periodically make statements decrying abortion as &quot;immoral&quot;. Still, there has been no focused political campaign to significantly restrict abortion since legalization. In 2020, a citizens&#x27; initiative led by the Feminist Association, with the aim of updating the law and allowing elective abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, has gathered over 50,000 signatures, the necessary threshold to compel the Parliament to consider the proposal.

<doc id="697505" wikidata="Q1152821" url="?curid=697505" title="Profiterole">
<text>A profiterole (), chou à la crème (), also known alternatively as a cream puff (US), is a filled French choux pastry ball with a typically sweet and moist filling of whipped cream, custard, pastry cream, or ice cream. The puffs may be embellished or left plain or garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered sugar.

Savory profiterole are also made, filled with pureed meats, cheese, and so on. These were formerly common garnishes for soups. The various names may be associated with particular variants of filling or sauce in different places.

==Preparation== 
Choux pastry dough is piped through a pastry bag or dropped with a pair of spoons into small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, the baked profiteroles are injected with filling using a pastry bag and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.

==Presentation==
The most common presentations are pastry cream, whipped cream, or ice cream filling, topped with powdered sugar or chocolate ganache and possibly more whipped cream. They are also served plain, with a crisp caramel glaze, iced, or with fruit.

Filled and glazed with caramel, they are assembled into a type of pièce montée called croquembouches, often served at weddings in France and Italy, during the Christmas holiday in France, and are served during important celebrations in Gibraltar. Profiteroles are also used as the outer wall of a St. Honoré cake.

==History==
The French word &quot;profiterole&quot;, &#x27;small profit, gratification&#x27;, has been used in cuisine since the 16th century.

In the 17th century, profiteroles were small hollow bread rolls filled with a mixture of sweetbreads, truffles, artichoke bottoms, mushrooms, pieces of partridge, pheasant, or various poultry, accompanied by garnish. They could also be served in a soup.

François Massialot in &quot;Le Cuisinier royal et bourgeois&quot; (1698) gives several recipes for profiterole soup, with fillings of minced ham and poultry on a stew of mushrooms, asparagus, artichoke bottoms, rooster crests, sweetbreads, and truffles. The profiteroles are made of bread dough.

Joseph Menon in his &quot;Traité de cuisine&quot; (1732) and François Marin in &quot;Les Dons de Comus&quot; (1750) give other examples of savory recipes while keeping the same principle.

The profiteroles we know today, using choux pastry, were created in the 19th century.

Jules Gouffé in his &quot;Livre de cuisine&quot; (1870) explains that a profiterole is a small choux pastry. Gustave Garlin in &quot;Le Cuisinier moderne&quot; (1887) mentions profiteroles filled with cream and glazed with chocolate or coffee, worked to be smooth and shiny.

A widely-repeated legend claims that choux pastry, the key ingredient of profiteroles, was invented by the head chef to the court of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. But this is a 19th-century invention.

The pastry cook&#x27;s art of choux pastry began to develop around the 17th century. The patissier Jean Avice developed the pastry further in the middle of the 18th century and created choux buns, with the dough becoming known as &#x27;pâte à choux&#x27;, since only choux buns were made from it. In the 19th century, Antoine Carême developed the recipe used today.

==United States==

Cream puffs have appeared on U.S. restaurant menus since at least 1851. 

The Wisconsin State Fair is known for its giant cream puffs.

In Hawaii, coco puffs (not to be confused with Cocoa Puffs) made by Liliha Bakery are a popular dessert. They are filled with chocolate creme patissiere and topped with a frosting known as &quot;chantilly&quot; (similar to German chocolate cake sans coconut and nuts).

<doc id="697510" wikidata="Q209077" url="?curid=697510" title="José de Espronceda">
<text>José Ignacio Javier Oriol Encarnación de Espronceda y Delgado (25 March 1808 – 23 May 1842) was a Romantic Spanish poet, one of the most representative authors of the 19th century. He was influenced by Eugenio de Ochoa, Federico Madrazo, Alfred Tennyson, Richard Chenevix Trench and Diego de Alvear.

==Life==

Espronceda was born in Almendralejo, at the Province of Badajoz. As a youth, he studied at the Colegio San Mateo at Madrid, having Alberto Lista as a teacher. When he was 15 years old, he formed a secret society named &quot;Los Numantinos&quot; alongside his friends Ventura de la Vega and Patricio de la Escosura, conspiring against Ferdinand VII and intending to avenge the death of Rafael del Riego. For this, he was imprisoned in a monastery and exiled. Afterward, he left Spain and lived in Lisbon, Belgium, France, England and Holland. On his return to Spain in 1833, he became active in the extreme left-wing of Spanish political culture. Espronceda is also known for his affair with Teresa Mancha, for whom he wrote &quot;Canto a Teresa&quot; (from &quot;El diablo mundo&quot;). He died of diphtheria in 1842.

In 1902, his body was moved to Panteón de Hombres Ilustres, Spain.

==Literary production==
Having been inspired to a literary career by his teacher Alberto Lista, Espronceda began to write the historical poem &quot;El Pelayo&quot; during his stay in the monastery. The poem was never completed. Later he wrote the novel &quot;Sancho Saldaña&quot;. His other important works include &quot;El estudiante de Salamanca&quot;, whose main character is Don Félix de Montemar, &quot;El mendigo&quot;, &quot;¡Guerra!&quot;, &quot;Al dos de mayo&quot; and &quot;El diablo mundo&quot;, long lyric poems, the latter remained unfinished. Also important were &quot;A Jarifa en una orgía&quot;, &quot;El verdugo&quot;, &quot;El canto del cosaco&quot;, &quot;La canción del pirata&quot; and &quot;Himno al sol&quot;. Many of his works display the tendencies of Romanticism, and along with José Zorrilla he is considered Spain&#x27;s most important Romantic poet, as well as the most rebellious.
In 2006 Diego Martinez Torron has published the first annotated edition of the complete works of José de Espronceda with unpublished text, and with also unpublished text in &quot;El otro Espronceda&quot;.

<doc id="697519" wikidata="Q33526" url="?curid=697519" title="Stucco">
<text>Stucco or render is a construction material made of aggregates, a binder, and water. Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid. It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings, exterior walls, and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture. Stucco can be applied on construction materials such as metal, expanded metal lath, concrete, cinder block, or clay brick and adobe for decorative and structural purposes.

In English, &quot;stucco&quot; sometimes refers to a coating for the outside of a building and &quot;plaster&quot; to a coating for interiors. As described below, however, the materials themselves often have little or no difference. Other European languages, notably Italian, do not have the same distinction: &quot;stucco&quot; means &quot;plaster&quot; in Italian and serves for both.

==Composition==

The basic composition of stucco is lime, water, and sand.

The difference in nomenclature between stucco, plaster, and mortar is based more on use than composition. Until the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was common that mortar as well as plaster, which was used inside a building, and stucco, which was used outside, would consist of the same primary materials: lime and sand.

Animal or plant fibers were often added for additional strength. Sometimes additives such as acrylics and glass fibers are added to improve the structural properties of the stucco. This is usually done with what is considered a one-coat stucco system, as opposed to the traditional three-coat method.

In the latter nineteenth century, Portland cement was added with increasing frequency to cover surfaces in contact with soil or water. At the same time, traditional lime plasters were often being replaced by gypsum plaster.
Lime is almost as good in balancing humidity as clay. It prevents moisture accumulation inside the building as well as in the wall by its excellent permeability, and is more elastic and workable than cement render. 

Lime itself is usually white; color comes from the aggregate or any added pigments. Lime stucco has the property of being self-healing to a limited degree because of the slight water solubility of lime (which in solution can be deposited in cracks, where it solidifies). 
Portland cement stucco is very hard and brittle and can easily crack and separate from the surface if the base on which it is applied is not stable. Typically, its color was gray, from the innate color of most Portland cement, but white Portland cement is also available. Today&#x27;s stucco manufacturers offer a very wide range of colors that can be mixed integrally in the finish coat. Other materials such as stone and glass chips are sometimes &quot;dashed&quot; onto the finish coat before drying, with the finished product commonly known as &quot;rock dash&quot;, &quot;pebble dash&quot;, or also as roughcast if the stones are incorporated directly into the stucco, used mainly from the early 20th through the early 21st centuries.

==Traditional stucco==
As a building material, stucco is a durable, attractive, and weather-resistant wall covering. It was traditionally used as both an interior and exterior finish applied in one or two thin layers directly over a solid masonry, brick, or stone surface. The finish coat usually contained an integral color and was typically textured for appearance.

Then with the introduction and development of heavy timber and light wood-framed construction methods, stucco was adapted for this new use by adding a reinforcement lattice, or lath, attached to and spanning between the structural supports and by increasing the thickness and number of layers of the total system. The lath added support for the wet plaster and tensile strength to the brittle, cured stucco; while the increased thickness and number of layers helped control cracking.

The traditional application of stucco and lath occurs in three coats—the scratch coat, the brown coat and the finish coat. The two base coats of plaster are either hand-applied or machine sprayed. The finish coat can be troweled smooth, hand-textured, floated to a sand finish or sprayed.

Originally, the lath material was strips of wood installed horizontally on the wall, with spaces between, that would support the wet plaster until it cured. This lath and plaster technique became widely used.

In exterior wall applications, the lath is installed over a weather-resistant asphalt-impregnated felt or paper sheet that protects the framing from the moisture that can pass through the porous stucco.

Following World War II, the introduction of metal wire mesh, or netting, replaced the use of wood lath. Galvanizing the wire made it corrosion resistant and suitable for exterior wall applications. At the beginning of the 21st century, this &quot;traditional&quot; method of wire mesh lath and three coats of exterior plaster was still widely used.

In some parts of the United States with a warmer climate (like California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Florida), stucco is the predominant exterior for both residential and commercial construction. Stucco exterior (with wood frame interior) became a popular alternative in the southwestern United States during the 1970s, as the masonry labor costs for adobe rose.

==Sculptural and architectural use==
Stucco has also been used as a sculptural and artistic material. Stucco relief was used in the architectural decoration schemes of many ancient cultures. Examples of Egyptian, Minoan, and Etruscan stucco reliefs remain extant. In the art of Mesopotamia and ancient Persian art there was a widespread tradition of figurative and ornamental internal stucco reliefs, which continued into Islamic art, for example in Abbasid Samarra, now using geometrical and plant-based ornament. As the arabesque reached its full maturity, carved stucco remained a very common medium for decoration and calligraphic inscriptions. Indian architecture used stucco as a material for sculpture in an architectural context. It is rare in the countryside.

In Roman art of the late Republic and early Empire, stucco was used extensively for the decoration of vaults. Though marble was the preferred sculptural medium in most regards, stucco was better for use in vaults because it was lighter and better suited to adapt to the curvature of the ceiling. Baroque and Rococo architecture makes heavy use of stucco. Examples can be found in churches and palaces, where stucco is mostly used to provide a smooth, decorative transition from walls to ceiling, decorating and giving measure to ceiling surfaces. Stucco is an integral part of the art of belcomposto, the Baroque concept that integrates the three classic arts, architecture, sculpture, and painting.

The Greco-Buddhist art of modern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan made extensive use in monasteries and temples of stucco for three-dimensional monumental sculpture as well as reliefs. These were usually carved from a rough modelling over a framework and then painted. Similar techniques are used for the life-size statues decorating the gopurams of Hindu temples in modern South Asia.

Since stucco can be used for decoration as well as for figurative representation, it provides an ideal transitive link from architectural details to wall paintings such as the typically Baroque &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; ceilings, as in the work of the Wessobrunner School. Here, the real architecture of the church is visually extended into a heavenly architecture with a depiction of Christ, the Virgin Mary or the Last Judgment at the center. Stucco is used to form a semi-plastic extension of the real architecture that merges into the painted architecture.
Because of its &quot;aristocratic&quot; appearance, Baroque-looking stucco decoration was used frequently in upper-class apartments of the 19th and early 20th century.

Beginning in the 1920s, stucco, especially in its Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque materialization, became increasingly unpopular with modern architects in some countries, resulting not only in new buildings without stucco but also in a widespread to remove the stucco from existing tenements.

Stucco was still employed in the 1950s in molded forms for decorating the joints between walls and ceilings inside houses. It was generally painted the same colour as the ceiling and used in designs where a picture rail or rat rail was in use.

==Modern stucco==
Modern stucco is used as an exterior cement plaster wall covering. It is usually a mix of sand, Portland cement, lime and water, but may also consist of a proprietary mix of additives including fibers and synthetic acrylics that add strength and flexibility. Modern synthetic stucco can be applied as one base layer and a finish layer, which is thinner and faster to apply, compared to the traditional application of three-coat stucco. Imitation stone stucco can also be produced using the traditional application, but with marble dust being added to the mixture.

As with any cement-based material, stucco must be reinforced to resist movement cracking. Plastic or wire mesh lath, attached with nails or screws to the structural framing, is embedded into the base coat to provide stiffening for the stucco. 

Where stucco is to be applied to a structure of wood-framing or light-gauge steel framing, the framing is protected from moisture damage by applying a cement based primer, or a vapor-permeable, water-resistant weather barrier; typically an asphalt-saturated paper or one of a variety of manufactured plastic-based sheets, known as &quot;building wraps&quot; or &quot;stucco wraps&quot;. The properties of the weather barrier must not only protect the framing from rain and moisture, but at the same time allow the free passage of any water vapor generated inside the building to escape through the wall.

A wide variety of stucco accessories, such as weep screeds, control and expansion joints, corner-aids and architectural reveals are sometimes also incorporated into the lath. Wire lath is used to give the plaster something to attach to and to add strength. Types include expanded-metal lath, woven-wire lath, and welded-wire lath.

If applied during very dry weather, the layers of stucco are sprayed with water for one or more days to keep a level of moisture within the stucco while it cures, a process known as &quot;moist curing&quot;. If the stucco dries too soon, the chemical hardening (&quot;hydration&quot;) will be incomplete, resulting in a weaker and brittler stucco.

<doc id="697523" wikidata="Q1378199" url="?curid=697523" title="Kim Fowley">
<text>Kim Vincent Fowley (July 21, 1939 – January 15, 2015) was an American record producer, songwriter and musician who was behind a string of novelty and cult pop rock singles in the 1960s, and managed the Runaways in the 1970s. He has been described as &quot;one of the most colorful characters in the annals of rock &amp; roll&quot;, as well as &quot;a shadowy cult figure well outside the margins of the mainstream&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Fowley was the son of character actor Douglas Fowley and actress Shelby Payne. His parents later divorced and Payne married William Friml, son of composer Rudolf Friml. Fowley attended University High School.

==Career==
In 1957, he was hospitalized with polio and, on his release, became manager and publicist for local band the Sleepwalkers that included Bruce Johnston, drummer Sandy Nelson and, occasionally, Phil Spector. He spent some time in the armed forces and, by his own account, worked in the sex industry in Los Angeles in the late 1950s. In 1959, he began working in the music industry in various capacities for both Alan Freed and Berry Gordy. His first record as producer was &quot;Charge&quot; by the Renegades, a group comprising Johnston, Nelson, Nik Venet and Richard Podolor. He promoted records for the duo Skip &amp; Flip (Skip Battin and Gary S. Paxton), including the No. 11 hit &quot;Cherry Pie&quot;.

===1960s===
During the early 1960s, Fowley was involved as co-producer/co-publisher with a string of successful records produced in Los Angeles. With Gary S. Paxton he recorded the novelty song &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the charts in 1960 and was credited to the non-existent group the Hollywood Argyles. In 1961 he co-produced the instrumental &quot;Like, Long Hair&quot;, arranged by Paxton, which became a No. 38 hit for Paul Revere and the Raiders. He arranged &quot;Nut Rocker&quot; for B. Bumble and the Stingers, which became a No. 1 hit in the UK in 1962 and talent scouted &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;, a No. 48 hit for the Rivingtons. The following year he produced &quot;Popsicles and Icicles&quot; by the Murmaids, which reached No. 3 in the charts in 1963 and which was written by a pre-Bread David Gates, then a session musician and songwriter who had met Fowley while Kim was hitchhiking in Los Angeles.

During the mid-1960s, Fowley publicized/consulted singer P.J. Proby and relocated for a time to London, England. Fowley wrote the lyrics for the song &quot;Portobello Road&quot;, the B-side of Cat Stevens&#x27; first single, &quot;I Love My Dog&quot;. He produced a Them spin-off band led by two ex-Them members, brothers Pat and Jackie McAuley (who were only allowed to use the band name Other Them in the UK, but called themselves Them on the European continent, releasing an album called &quot;Them Belfast Gypsies&quot; and a single &quot;Let&#x27;s Freak Out&quot; under the name Freaks of Nature); an early incarnation of Slade known as the N&#x27;Betweens; Soft Machine (he produced &quot;Love Makes Sweet Music&quot;, their first single); and the Lancasters, an instrumental rock group featuring a young Ritchie Blackmore. He worked with an up-and-coming band, the Farinas, and renamed them &quot;Family&quot;.

In London around 1967 Fowley collaborated with the Seekers&#x27; guitarist/arranger Keith Potger. Together (with Potger writing under the nom de plume John Martin) they wrote the lyrics to &quot;Emerald City&quot;. Potger has said the song was originally quite unlike the eventual Seekers single, and that he heavily &quot;Seeker-ized&quot; the arrangement before presenting it to the group. The tune was based on the &quot;Ode To Joy&quot; theme from Beethoven&#x27;s ninth (&quot;Choral&quot;) symphony.

Fowley worked on occasion as a recording artist in the 1960s, issuing albums such as &quot;Love Is Alive and Well&quot;. In 1965, he wrote and produced a song about the psychedelic experience, &quot;The Trip&quot;. In 1966 Fowley and Gail Sloatman (later Gail Zappa) recorded a spoken word single as &quot;Bunny and Bear&quot;. The record is a satire of Sonny and Cher. 

With Brian Parker, Fowley co-wrote &quot;Sea of Faces&quot; for UK group, Unit Four Plus Two when he was living in England with P.J. Proby. The group recorded the song but it was never released. Another group, The Ways and Means who were managed by Ron Fairway recorded it and it was released on Pye 7N 17277. It became a minor hit for the band making it to no.39 on the Radio City City Sixty chart for the Sunday 1 to Sunday 8 January 1967 period, and to no. 41 on the Radio Caroline chart on the 21st. 

He was credited for &quot;hypophone&quot; on the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s first album &quot;Freak Out!&quot; When asked later about this, band leader Frank Zappa said that &quot;The hypophone is his mouth, &#x27;cause all that ever comes out of it is hype.&quot; Other singles by Fowley as a recording artist included &quot;Animal Man&quot; from his popular 1968 album &quot;Outrageous&quot;; during the song he remarks, &quot;It&#x27;s too dirty, it&#x27;ll be banned&quot;. All his efforts as a solo artist since 1970 have become cult items, both in reissue and bootleg formats.

In 1968, Fowley joined forces with a young band, St John Green, from Topanga Canyon in California, to produce their only album, which contains songs, musical soundtracks, comedy and dark poetry. The band members were: Ed Bissot (bass), Bill Kirkland (guitars), Vic Sabino (vocals, harmonica and percussion), Michael &#x27;Papabax&#x27; Baxter (keyboards, arranger), and Shelly Scott (drums). The album was engineered by Michael Lloyd. Fowley later claimed it to be &quot;one of the great lost records...Somebody will reissue it someday and people will start crying and jacking off and smoking dope to it. It&#x27;s a great record. There&#x27;s only a handful of records that I&#x27;ve made that are great.&quot; The album was released by MGM on the Flick Disc label, but the group disbanded soon afterwards.

He is credited with being the inspiration behind promoter John Brower&#x27;s call to John Lennon that resulted in the last-minute appearance of the Plastic Ono Band at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival on September 13, 1969, where Fowley was the MC. At this event, Fowley invited the audience to light matches and lighters to welcome a nervous John Lennon to the stage.

In 1969, Fowley produced the album &quot;I&#x27;m Back and I&#x27;m Proud&quot; for Gene Vincent. He co-wrote for Warren Zevon&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;. Fowley collaborated with his friend Skip Battin during Battin&#x27;s membership as bassist with the Byrds on a number of songs which appeared on their early 1970&#x27;s albums: &quot;The Hungry Planet&quot;, &quot;You All Look Alike&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Absolute Happiness&quot;, &quot;Precious Kate&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Great National Pastime&quot;. The latter song was released as a single in late 1971. When Battin moved on to the New Riders of the Purple Sage in 1974, Fowley and Battin co-wrote five songs for the New Riders: &quot;On the Amazon&quot;, &quot;Big Wheels&quot;, &quot;Singing Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Neon Rose&quot; and &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;.

===1970s===
In 1970, Fowley moved to Helsinki, Finland, where he worked with the progressive rock band Wigwam, whom he called &quot;The Finnish Beatles.&quot; Fowley produced the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Tombstone Valentine,&quot; which was released in Finland on the Love Records label. The album was released as a double album in the US by Verve Forecast, with a second LP of extra tracks from the band&#x27;s previous catalog. According to Fowley, he gave a copy of the LP to David Bowie, who allegedly utilized the production style of the album for his next album (1971&#x27;s &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;). Fowley then moved to Sweden and produced the group Contact&#x27;s album &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Sixteen&quot; for Swedish label MNW (Music Network) Records, which landed in the Swedish Top 20. MNW released the Kim Fowley solo LP &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; the same year. Upon returning to Los Angeles, Fowley co-wrote the song &quot;Michoacan&quot; which was recorded by the Sir Douglas Quintet and appeared in the 1972 movie &quot;Cisco Pike&quot; starring Kris Kristofferson.

In 1971, The Byrds recorded three songs for the album &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; that were co-written by Byrds member Skip Battin and Kim Fowley. Fowley produced a re-recording of one of these songs, &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; with Battin later in the year. The re-recording featured the rest of the members of The Byrds (minus Roger McGuinn) as sidemen and was used in the soundtrack of the Edie Sedgwick film &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; (1972). Signpost Records signed Battin to a solo recording contract in 1972, and the Battin/Fowley team co-wrote every song on the resultant solo album &quot;Skip Battin&quot; (aka &quot;Skip&quot;).

Fowley produced the Boulder, Colorado-based rock and roll revival act Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids for a television appearance in early 1972. The group signed a contract with Epic Records in September of that year, and Fowley produced their self-titled debut LP for the label at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles. Fowley also produced three recordings by Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids that were included in the film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973). These songs were &quot;At the Hop&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s So Fine&quot; and &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. The first two tracks were also featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

In May 1972, Fowley was signed to Capitol Records for a long-term solo recording contract. Capitol released Fowley&#x27;s LP &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot; in June of that year. Fowley&#x27;s follow-up solo LP, &quot;International Heroes,&quot; was mixed in February and released in March 1973.

While on tour to promote his solo album &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot; in the summer of 1972, Fowley met Boston disk jockey Maxanne Satori, who introduced him to a pre-fame Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. Fowley returned to Boston after the completion of the tour and arranged to have engineer Stuart &quot;Dinky&quot; Dawson record a demo with The Modern Lovers in Dawson&#x27;s home studio. Later in autumn 1973, Fowley worked with the band again, this time recording them in Los Angeles at Gold Star Studios on behalf of Warner Bros. Records. Tracks from these sessions were released as bonus tracks on later issues of &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot; (1976), the album &quot;The Original Modern Lovers&quot; (1981), and the Warner Bros. Loss Leaders compilation &quot;Troublemakers&quot; (1980).

In 1973, Fowley assembled the Hollywood Stars, his first &quot;conceptual band&quot;. Musician, songwriter and future Hollywood Stars member, Mark Anthony, was working as Fowley&#x27;s chauffeur at the time. At one point, Anthony spoke to New York Dolls manager Marty Thau at a party and asked him how the New York Dolls were formed. Thau stated that the members were &quot;a bunch of broke street kids hanging around.&quot; Upon hearing this, Fowley decided to create a West Coast answer to the New York Dolls in a similar manner, taking the band name from the minor league baseball team of the same name. Upon assembling the group, Fowley rented a studio in the San Fernando Valley and put the band on a rigorous rehearsal schedule, utilizing songs written by songwriter Mars Bonfire, and by himself and producer/songwriter Peter Lion. The band played an invitation-only concert at Studio Instrument Rentals in Hollywood, which brought a crowd of 380 people, including representatives of the labels Liberty Records, A&amp;M Records and Columbia Records. A&amp;M and Columbia began bidding against each other to sign the band. Columbia signed The Hollywood Stars on March 28, 1974, and Bill Szymczyk was brought in to produce the band&#x27;s debut album, which was recorded at The Record Plant over the course of 34 days. Early in the recording process, Szymczyk abandoned the project, leaving the engineer to produce the album. Soon afterward, Columbia dismissed The Hollywood Stars&#x27; A&amp;R representative in an internal staffing change, decided not to release the album and dropped the group from the label. Despite the band&#x27;s local popularity, internal tensions and industry stigma from the failure of the Columbia Records deal led to the decision to break up the band. The group played their final performance headlining the Whisky a Go Go on November 10, 1974.

In December 1973, Fowley connected the Hollywood Stars with producer Bob Ezrin, who worked with the band on arrangements for their song &quot;Escape&quot;, which was co-written by Fowley and Hollywood Stars member Mark Anthony. Although Ezrin initially passed on working with the band further, he expressed interest in utilizing two of their songs. Just before the band&#x27;s breakup in 1974, Fowley went back to Bob Ezrin and offered him usage of the two songs. Ezrin then took &quot;Escape&quot; to Alice Cooper, who made changes to the lyrics and included the song on &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot; (1975). Similarly, Ezrin took &quot;King of the Night Time World&quot; (also co-written by Fowley and Anthony) to Kiss, who altered the lyrics slightly and recorded the song for the album &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1976). Ezrin also asked Fowley to write lyrics for &quot;Do You Love Me?,&quot; another song that was recorded for Kiss&#x27; &quot;Destroyer&quot; LP. Fowley worked on the lyrics for the latter song in 1975 while assembling the band The Runaways with Joan Jett.

Fowley produced and wrote songs for the Helen Reddy albums &quot;Ear Candy&quot; (1977) and &quot;We&#x27;ll Sing in the Sunshine&quot; (1978). He also co-wrote songs with Leon Russell during this period. 

In 1978, Fowley formed the Orchids, another all-female rock band, with Laurie McAllister, the last bassist from The Runaways, and Sandy Fury, a 13-year-old rock prodigy on rhythm guitar and vocals.

In 1979, Fowley signed new artists, such as Tommy Rock, the Popsicles, and the Orchids. Fowley promoted &quot;Kim Fowley Night&quot; featuring these bands at the Whisky a Go Go. Fowley brought Stiv Bators &amp; the Dead Boys, the Popsicles, and the Orchids into Leon Russell&#x27;s Cherokee Recording Studio in Hollywood to record &quot;LA, LA (I&#x27;m on a Hollywood High)&quot;. Also in 1979, Fowley produced the five man group Streettalk at Mandrill Studios in Auckland, New Zealand.

====The Runaways 1975–1978====

Fowley had an idea for assembling an all-female rock band in a time when, according to guitarist Joan Jett, &quot;there were no young girls at all playing guitar or any sort of instruments.&quot; In early 1975, Fowley met lyricist Kari Krome at a party held for Alice Cooper, put her on salary, and had her begin looking for female performers. Krome met Joan Jett and brought her to Fowley. Jett successfully auditioned for Fowley by playing ukulele to a Sweet album, and picked up rhythm guitar as her instrument. Soon afterward, Fowley met Sandy West in the parking lot of the Rainbow Bar and Grill, who agreed to play drums. Fowley had Jett rehearse with West at the latter&#x27;s home in Huntington Beach, and auditioned the pair on the telephone to music journalist Ritchie Yorke. He then turned to two radio stations to advertise for further auditions, which brought bassist Micki Steele (later of The Bangles) and guitarist Lita Ford to the group. Steele left due to creative differences, and was replaced by Jackie Fox, whom Fowley colleague Rodney Bingenheimer found in the parking lot of the West Hollywood nightclub the Starwood. Just before adding Fox, Fowley and Jett discovered Cherie Currie at the teen nightclub The Sugar Shack and brought her in as lead vocalist for the group.

Fowley touted the new group The Runaways as &quot;an all girl answer to Grand Funk,&quot; and the band signed to Kim Fowley Productions for management in September 1975. The lineup of Jett, West, and Steele made its live debut at the Whisky a Go Go September 28–29, opening for the newly reformed Hollywood Stars.

Phonogram/Mercury Records&#x27; West Coast director of A&amp;R Denny Rosencrantz agreed to sign The Runaways on December 12, 1975. The band finished their debut album &quot;The Runaways&quot; in May 1976. The album is listed as &quot;Produced and directed by Kim Fowley&quot;, and gives Fowley arrangement and numerous songwriting credits. Mercury released the album in June 1976 to an initial position of #188 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; top albums chart, favorable reviews, and numerous radio and album adds, as well as sales of 70,000 units.

The Runaways were the subject of a writeup in &quot;People&quot; magazine in September 1976. A week later, Fowley severed his ties with the band, and forfeited his rights, titles, claims and merchandising ownership to Mercury Records. Mercury refused to accept Fowley&#x27;s stakehold in the band and turned it back to him the following week. Fowley and the band reconciled in November, and returned to the studio to record their followup album &quot;Queens of Noise&quot;. The album was released in December 1976, was co-produced by Fowley and Earl Mankey, and again co-credited Fowley for arrangements and songwriting.

In June 1977, The Runaways toured Japan, recording the album &quot;Live in Japan&quot; while on the tour. &quot;Live in Japan&quot; included several songs written by Fowley. Jackie Fox left mid-tour and was replaced by bassist Vicki Blue when the group returned to America. While the band was still a five-piece and with Blue as a new member, Fowley had the band learn the Arrows song &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll,&quot; which would go on to be an international number one hit for Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts in 1982.

Cherie Currie left the band in August 1977. Fowley recorded The Runaways&#x27; third LP, &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Night&quot;, at Larrabee Studios the same month, with the band as a four-piece and with Joan Jett on vocals.

Cherie Currie contractually owed an album to Fowley&#x27;s management, so just a few weeks after leaving The Runaways, she went into Larrabee Studios to record her debut solo album &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Only Skin Deep&quot;, with Fowley co-producing. The album featured Currie going in an MOR direction, which Fowley chose in order to play on Currie&#x27;s liking for mellower music. Fowley co-wrote &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Only Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Daze&quot; and &quot;Young and Wild&quot;. One song on the album, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, featured Cherie&#x27;s twin sister Marie Currie on harmony vocals. Fowley sent conflicting stories to Japan about whether or not Cherie did indeed have a twin sister who sang on the track, creating a frenzy of interest when Cherie and Marie arrived to Japan for a two-week tour to support the album. The album was released in 1978 to Japan and to Europe but was not released in the United States.

In October 1977, Fowley and Joan Jett appeared on an episode of &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; hosted by Tom Snyder. The show aired October 11, and was dedicated to the topic of punk rock. While on the show, Snyder mentioned that Fowley will be &quot;quitting [working with Jett] in 48 hours,&quot; which Fowley affirmed as correct. In a feature on the Runaways dated November 12, 1977, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine writer Sandy Robertson confirmed that &quot;Kim Fowley will no longer be producing The Runaways, the new album &quot;Waiting For The Night&quot; [sic] being his last work with them.&quot;

The Runaways&#x27; &quot;Waitin&#x27; For the Night&quot; was released in October 1977. The album is listed as &quot;Produced and directed by Kim Fowley&quot;, with the tracks &quot;Wasted&quot;, &quot;School Days&quot; and &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Night&quot; written by Fowley.

In February 1978, a spokesman for Fowley corrected information stating that Fowley had exited The Runaways as producer, claiming to the contrary that Fowley was still with the group and &quot;to be considered its producer of record&quot;. The Runaways signed with American Entertainment Management for personal management the following month. Fowley followed this up with the publication of several legal notices claiming ownership of &quot;The Runaways&quot; service mark, recording authorization, and merchandising rights.

===1980s===
In the 1980s Fowley moved to Australia where he announced that he was &quot;looking for the new Beatles or ABBA&quot;. His search turned up power pop band Beathoven who were still under a recording contract with EMI. Changing their name to the Innocents, he secured a new record deal with Trafalgar Records and produced several songs for the group. They too became a cult band in later bootlegs/reissues. Fowley produced the first demos for the iconic power pop band, Candy, which featured Gilby Clarke and Kyle Vincent. Vincent was Fowley&#x27;s personal assistant. Producer Fowley and attorney David Chatfield recorded the first album for Steel Breeze at Rusk studios in Hollywood and got Steel Breeze their recording contract with RCA. Casey Kasem, on the edition of March 12, 1983, of American Top 40, describes how Fowley discovered Steel Breeze while going through approximately 1200 demo tapes that were about to be discarded by a local Hollywood nightclub, Madame Wong&#x27;s. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Want Me Anymore&quot; was the first single from the band&#x27;s self-titled album and quickly jumped into the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 supported by a video that was a favorite of early MTV, and peaked at # 16. The next single, &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Is Easy&quot;, also made it into the Top 40.

In 1984, still owning rights to the name &quot;the Runaways&quot;, Fowley rebuilt the image around Gayle Welch, an unknown teenager from New Zealand. Adding Denise Prior, Missy Bonilla (then a typist for Denny Diante at what was CBS Records) and Cathy DiAmber (Catherine Dombrowski) with David Carr on keyboards, a Chicago guitarist Bill Millay and numerous session musicians. Fowley, assisted by New Zealander Glenn Holland, sought to cash in on the fame of the former Runaways members who had gone on to significant success in their individual solo careers. In 1985, he returned to the United States and recorded further songs with the Innocents&#x27; David Minchin.

In 1986, Fowley spotted the band Shanghai (consisting of Eric Leach and Taz Rudd of Symbol Six, Brent Muscat of Faster Pussycat, Patrick Muzingo, and Todd Muscat of Decry) at the Troubadour. After seeing their performance he asked, &quot;Are you ready to make a record?!&quot; They immediately moved in with Fowley and began writing and recording songs. David Libert, Alice Cooper&#x27;s ex-road manager and agent for George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, was recruited to come in to handle the day-to-day babysitting chores. Shanghai played the reopening of the Whisky a Go Go in April 1986 with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Faster Pussycat. Their last show was at the Scream in Los Angeles in 1987.

===2000s===
Fowley is featured in &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;, a 2003 documentary about the disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer.

Also in 2003, Fowley made a return trip to London, England, where he made an in-store appearance at Intoxica Records on Portobello Road and curated and performed an evening of music and entertainment at the Dirty Water Club at its then base at the Boston Music Room in North London.

Fowley became an experimental filmmaker after the DVD release of &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;. His written and directed works include: &quot;Black Room Doom&quot;, &quot;Dollboy: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Satan of Silverlake&quot;, &quot;The Golden Road to Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Goes Surfing&quot;, &quot;Trailer Park&#x27;s On Fire&quot; and &quot;Jukebox California&quot;. Video clips/scenes from these movies can be seen on YouTube and Myspace, and feature a cast of regulars including but not limited to musical oddities such as the Fabulous Miss Wendy, Giddle Partridge, Richard Rogers (Crazy White Man) and Clown Porn Queen Hollie Stevens.

Fowley released the 21-track solo album &quot;Adventures in Dreamland&quot; on WEED/Innerstate Records in 2004. It contains the songs &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Terrors in Tinseltown&quot;, and &quot;Ballad of Phil Spector&quot;.

In 2008, Fowley was reunited with Cherie Currie at Harry Houdini&#x27;s mansion in Los Angeles. He played three dozen gigs between June 2007 and February 2009 as the act &quot;Crazy White Man&quot;, a duo featuring him on vocals and Richard Rogers on guitar. The bulk of the Crazy White Man shows took place during 2008 and included the Tribute to Gidget Gein, which raised funds for Gidget&#x27;s Hollywood Forever memorial.

Capitol re-released several of his titles, and director Guy Ritchie used his song &quot;The Trip&quot; in the 2008 film &quot;RocknRolla&quot;. Fowley was regularly heard on Sirius Satellite Radio with a four-hour show on Saturdays and Sundays.

Currie wrote a memoir of her time in the Runaways, which was turned into the film, &quot;The Runaways&quot;, released on March 19, 2010. The film featured Michael Shannon as Fowley, alongside Kristen Stewart as Jett and Dakota Fanning as Currie.

In 2012, Fowley won the Special Jury Prize at the 13th Melbourne Underground Film Festival for his two feature projects – &quot;Golden Road to Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Black Room Doom&quot;.

===2010s===
In his last years, Fowley worked on writing and publishing his autobiography, which he divided between three distinct books. He released the first volume of his autobiography, &quot;Lord of Garbage&quot;, published by Kicks Books, in 2012. It covers the years 1939–1969 and describes his early childhood and beginning years in the music business. The second volume of his autobiography was intended to be called &quot;Planet Pain&quot; and to cover the years 1970–1994. The last volume was intended to be finished on his deathbed and to be released posthumously because, as the 2010s began, Fowley was terminally ill. On September 24, 2014, Fowley married longtime girlfriend and music executive Kara Wright-Fowley, in a private ceremony in Los Angeles.

== Death ==
Fowley died of bladder cancer in Hollywood, California on January 15, 2015, at the age of 75. He is interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Sexual misconduct allegations==
In a 2001 interview, Michael Steele of The Bangles claimed Fowley fired her from The Runaways for refusing his sexual advances.

In July 2015, six months after Fowley&#x27;s death, Jackie Fuchs (who had performed under the stage name Jackie Fox with The Runaways) claimed that Fowley had raped her in 1975 during a New Year&#x27;s Eve party while he was involved with the band. Fox also alleged that Joan Jett and Cherie Currie witnessed the rape. Jett and Currie both denied seeing the incident, but songwriter Kari Krome, as well as other bystanders who did not intervene, have corroborated it. &quot;Look Away&quot;, a documentary about sexual abuse in the rock music industry features Fuchs&#x27; story.

In 2023, Kari Krome filed a lawsuit against Fowley&#x27;s estate alleging that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was 14 or 15 years old.

<text>Llanfoist () is a village near Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, Wales, in the community of Llanfoist Fawr. Llanfoist derives from &quot;Ffwyst&quot;, an early Christian Welsh saint, although the anglicised version of the church patron is &quot;Saint Faith&quot;. The population was 1,228 in 2011.

==The Church of St Faith==
1901 Kelly&#x27;s Directory of Monmouthshire describes the parish church of St Faith&#x27;s:
The church holds records for baptisms from 1736–1975, for marriages from 1736–1971, for banns from 1824–47 and 1890–1933, and for burials from 1736-1945. There are also Bishops Transcripts for 1725-32, 1734–51, 1753-4, 1756–75, 1777–1806, 1808–10, 1813, 1815–16, 1820–37, 1841–58, 1862–1865, 1869 and 1880.

The parish of Llanelen has historically been held with Llanfoist, although since the retirement of the last resident Rector, the Reverend Thomas Arthur Foster (1923-2010) in 1992 the parishes have been served from Govilon (Llanwenarth Ultra). At the time of his departure, Father Foster was the longest serving incumbent in the Diocese of Monmouth, having held the benefice since 1959. His predecessor, the Reverend Harold Stanley Richards (1888-1976) served between 1930-59. In January 2012 an ancient yew tree in the grounds of St Faith&#x27;s Church, which was believed to be up to 1,000 years old, was brought down by high winds.

The village also had a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, erected in 1839. In 1851 the attendance was 200 for morning worship (with 180 scholars), 200 scholars in the afternoon and 40 for evening worship with 50 scholars.

==Crawshay Bailey and Alexander Cordell==
Llanfoist was home to ironmaster Crawshay Bailey. Before 1851 he had retired to Llanfoist House in the village. Llanfoist Primary School had a house named after him until 2008 when the House was renamed &#x27;Skirrid&#x27;. He died in 1872, aged 83, after at least seventy years in industry. His only son and heir, also Crawshay Bailey (1841–1887), inherited his estate.

The novelist Alexander Cordell, most famously author of &quot;Rape of the Fair Country&quot; is buried at Llanfoist.

==Amenities and attractions==
The village is located beneath the hill known as Blorenge, part of the Brecon Beacons National Park, rising above sea level over the vale of the River Usk. The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal runs just above the village.

The village has a church hall, situated on the Merthyr Road. The Llanfoist Fawr Primary School moved to a new location in the Barratt estate (Ffordd yr Ysgol) on Gypsy Lane and was opened in 2008.

===Llanfoist cemetery===
Llanfoist Cemetery (also known as New Cemetery), stands on the south bank of the River Usk at the northern edge of Llanfoist. Opened in 1894, its Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales registration describes it as a &quot;good example of a well-preserved Victorian landscaped garden cemetery&quot;. The cemetery is listed at Grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

<text>Largely as a result of the success of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, Transylvania has become a popular setting for gothic horror fiction, and most particularly vampire fiction. In some later books and movies Stoker&#x27;s Count Dracula was conflated with the historical Vlad III Dracula, known as Vlad the Impaler (1431–1476), who though most likely born in the Transylvanian city of Sighișoara, ruled over neighboring Wallachia.

<text>Lake Koocanusa () is a reservoir in British Columbia (Canada) and Montana (United States) formed by the damming of the Kootenai River by the Libby Dam in 1972. The Dam was formally dedicated by President Gerald Ford on August 24, 1975.

The lake is formed north of the dam, reaching to the Canada–United States border and further into British Columbia. The lake holds 13% of the water in the Columbia River system. The town of Rexford was moved, as well as the Great Northern Railway line. The town of Waldo, British Columbia is now covered by the lake. What was once a barrier to river travel, Jennings Canyon is now inundated by the lake. The Elk River joins the Kootenay River in the northern part of Lake Koocanusa, within Canadian territory.

Lake Koocanusa was named in a contest won by Alice Beers of Rexford, Montana. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;Kootenai River&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, and &quot;USA&quot;.

Lake Koocanusa was built as a joint project of the U.S. and Canada. It is 26 km (16 mi) from Libby, Montana, also on the Kootenai River, from which the dam gets its name. Libby Dam has a Visitors Center and can be accessed by the Lake Koocanusa Scenic Byway which begins in the nearby town of Libby, Montana.

The Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail follows Highway 37 along the east side of the lake before crossing over the Lake Koocanusa Bridge and climbing up Webb Mountain.

==Selenium contamination==
According to a March 8, 2021 article in &quot;The Narwhal&quot;, concerns have been raised about selenium pollution leaching from Teck Resources&#x27; Elk Valley open pit coal mines&#x27; waste rock, which is upstream from the lake system. A September 24, 2020 Montana Department of Environmental Quality presentation to the Board of Environmental Review Meeting, reported that the 95% of the selenium coming into Lake Koocanusa originates from the Elk River—&quot;which has been contaminated by current and historic coal mining in the Elk Valley.&quot; The average selenium levels in Lake Koocanusa were 1 part per billion. Montana has established new standards for selenium—0.8 parts per billion. Because of the high bioaccumulation of selenium in fish, excessive levels of selenium in an aquatic ecosystem has implications for human health. In the spring of 2020, Teck Resources, had &quot;reported a dramatic decline in adult westslope cutthroat trout in Elk Valley waterways closest to its mines&quot;. Since 2015, British Columbia and Montana have agreed to adopt aligned standards for selenium levels by 2020. Montana&#x27;s has been in force since the fall of 2020, but British Columbia has not aligned their standards yet.

== Fish ==
The lake supports a wide variety of fish species. Below is a table detailing the various fish species which may be encountered on the lake.

<text>Children&#x27;s Corner, L. 113, is a six-movement suite for solo piano by Claude Debussy. It was published by Durand in 1908, and was first performed by Harold Bauer in Paris on 18 December that year. In 1911, an orchestration by André Caplet was premiered and subsequently published.

== History ==
Debussy composed &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; between 1906 and 1908. He dedicated the suite to his daughter, Claude-Emma (known as &quot;Chou-Chou&quot;), who was born on 30 October 1905 in Paris. She is described as a lively and friendly child who was adored by her father. She was three years old when he dedicated the suite to her in 1908. The dedication reads: &quot;A ma chère petite Chouchou, avec les tendres excuses de son Père pour ce qui va suivre. C. D.&quot; (To my dear little Chouchou, with tender apologies from her father for what follows).

The suite was published by Durand in 1908, and was given its world première in Paris by Harold Bauer on 18 December that year. In 1911, an orchestration of the work by Debussy&#x27;s friend André Caplet received its premiere, and was subsequently published.

==Structure==

The suite is in six movements, each with an English-language title. This choice of language is most likely Debussy&#x27;s nod towards Chou-Chou&#x27;s English governess. The pieces are:

# Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum
# Jimbo&#x27;s Lullaby
# Serenade for the Doll
# The Snow Is Dancing
# The Little Shepherd
# Golliwogg&#x27;s Cakewalk

A typical performance of the suite lasts roughly 15 minutes.

=== 1. Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum ===

The title of the first movement alludes to sets of piano exercises of that name (&quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; translates as &quot;Steps to Parnassus&quot;), several of which had been published in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including one by the prolific publisher of piano exercises Carl Czerny, and Muzzio Clementi. The harshness and mechanicalism is supposed to play a joke at the excessive exercises of Czerny and Clementi. This piece is a rather ingenious study in finger independence with a twentieth-century vocabulary. In the middle, the pianist slows down and tries the material in other keys for exercise. Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Gradus Ad Parnassum&quot; is of intermediate difficulty and requires the ability to play more quickly and wildly. The pianist gets more frantic toward the end and finishes the piece with a bang. Debussy told his publisher that the movement should be played &quot;very early in the morning&quot;.

=== 2. Jimbo&#x27;s Lullaby ===
This work describes an elephant, Jumbo, who came from the French Sudan and lived briefly in the Jardin des plantes in Paris around the time of Debussy&#x27;s birth. The misspelling &quot;Jimbo&quot; betrays the Parisian accent which often confuses the pronunciation of &quot;um&quot; and &quot;un&quot; with &quot;im&quot; and &quot;in&quot;. It is a beautiful lullaby with some dark moments and whole-tone passages in the middle.

=== 3. Serenade for the Doll ===
This piece, in triple meter, is marked &quot;Allegretto ma non troppo&quot; (moderately fast, but not too fast). Debussy notes that the entire piece should be played with the soft pedal. The piece&#x27;s title—referring to a porcelain doll—alongside its delicacy, prominent featuring of bare fifths, the pentatonic scale, and parallel fourths, mark it as an example of chinoiserie. 

=== 4. The Snow Is Dancing ===
This piece can be considered quite difficult as it requires precise semi-detached playing in both hands with the melody between them. Again, there are darker moments in the bass near the middle. It portrays snow and muted objects seen through it.

=== 5. The Little Shepherd ===
&quot;The Little Shepherd&quot; depicts a shepherd with his flute. There are three solos and three commentaries following them. The first solo has a breath mark at the end. This piece has different modes in it and uses dissonances, which resolve into tonality.

=== 6. Golliwogg&#x27;s Cakewalk ===
At the time of its composition, Golliwoggs were in fashion, due partly to the popularity at that time of the novels of Florence Kate Upton (&quot;golliwog&quot; is a later usage). They were stuffed black dolls with red pants, red bow ties and wild hair, reminiscent of the blackface minstrel shows of the time. The cakewalk was a dance or a strut, and the dancer with the most elaborate steps won a cake (&quot;took the cake&quot;). The piece is a ragtime with its syncopations and banjo-like effects. The dynamic range is quite large and very effective.

During the piece, Debussy alludes satirically to Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. The opening bars turn the famous half-diminished Tristan chord into a jaunty, syncopated arpeggio, while the middle &#x27;B&#x27; section of this dance is interrupted on several occasions by the love-death leitmotif, marked &quot;avec une grande émotion&quot; (with great feeling). Each quotation is followed by banjo imitations.

Debussy composed one more piece in the same style a year later, &quot;The Little Nigar&quot;, as part of a piano method.

== Orchestrations and arrangements ==
* French composer André Caplet orchestrated the entire suite in 1911.
* Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen orchestrated the entire suite in 2015.
* Scottish guitarist Paul Galbraith transcribed the entire suite for brahms guitar in 2006.
* Leigh Howard Stevens transcribed five of the six movements for marimba.
* Japanese composer Isao Tomita transcribed the fourth and sixth movements for Moog Synthesizer in 1974 (RCA CD RCD14587).

<text>In mathematics, the geometric–harmonic mean M(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) of two positive real numbers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is defined as follows: we form the geometric mean of &quot;g&quot;0 = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;h&quot;0 = &quot;y&quot; and call it &quot;g&quot;1, i.e. &quot;g&quot;1 is the square root of &quot;xy&quot;. We also form the harmonic mean of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and call it &quot;h&quot;1, i.e. &quot;h&quot;1 is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Now we can iterate this operation with &quot;g&quot;1 taking the place of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;h&quot;1 taking the place of &quot;y&quot;. In this way, two interdependent sequences (&quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and (&quot;h&quot;&quot;n&quot;) are defined:

:formula_1

and 

:formula_2

Both of these sequences converge to the same number, which we call the geometric–harmonic mean M(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The geometric–harmonic mean is also designated as the harmonic–geometric mean. (cf. Wolfram MathWorld below.)

The existence of the limit can be proved by the means of Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem in a manner almost identical to the proof of existence of arithmetic–geometric mean.

==Properties==
M(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a number between the geometric and harmonic mean of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;; in particular it is between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. M(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is also homogeneous, i.e. if &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, then M(&quot;rx&quot;, &quot;ry&quot;) = &quot;r&quot; M(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;).

If AG(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the arithmetic–geometric mean, then we also have

:formula_3

==Inequalities==
We have the following inequality involving the Pythagorean means {&quot;H&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;} and iterated Pythagorean means {&quot;HG&quot;, &quot;HA&quot;, &quot;GA&quot;}:

:formula_4

where the iterated Pythagorean means have been identified with their parts {&quot;H&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;} in progressing order:

* &quot;H&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the harmonic mean,
* &quot;HG&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the harmonic–geometric mean,
* &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;HA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the geometric mean (which is also the harmonic–arithmetic mean),
* &quot;GA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the geometric–arithmetic mean,
* &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the arithmetic mean.

<text>AllMusic (previously known as All-Music Guide and AMG) is an American online music database. It catalogs more than three million album entries and 30 million tracks, as well as information on musicians and bands. Initiated in 1991, the database was first made available on the Internet in 1994. AllMusic is owned by RhythmOne.

==History==
AllMusic was launched as All-Music Guide by Michael Erlewine, a &quot;compulsive archivist, noted astrologer, Buddhist scholar, and musician&quot;. He became interested in using computers for his astrological work in the mid-1970s and founded a software company, Matrix, in 1977. In the early 1990s, as CDs replaced LPs as the dominant format for recorded music, Erlewine purchased what he thought was a CD of early recordings by Little Richard. After buying it, he discovered it was a &quot;flaccid latter-day rehash&quot;. Frustrated with the labeling, he researched using metadata to create a music guide. In 1990, in Big Rapids, Michigan, he founded &quot;All Music Guide&quot; with a goal to create an open-access database that included every recording &quot;since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost&quot;.

The first &quot;All Music Guide&quot;, published in 1992, was a 1,200-page reference book, packaged with a CD-ROM, titled &quot;All Music Guide: The Best CDs, Albums &amp; Tapes: The Expert&#x27;s Guide to the Best Releases from Thousands of Artists in All Types of Music&quot;. Its first online version, in 1994, was a text-based Gopher site. It moved to the World Wide Web as web browsers became more user-friendly.

Erlewine hired a database engineer, Vladimir Bogdanov, to design the &quot;All Music Guide&quot; framework, and recruited his nephew, writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, to develop editorial content. In 1993, Chris Woodstra joined the staff as an engineer. A &quot;record geek&quot; who had written for alternative weeklies and fanzines, his main qualification was an &quot;encyclopedic knowledge of music&quot;. 1,400 subgenres of music were created, a feature that became central to the site&#x27;s utility. In a 2016 article in &quot;Tedium&quot;, Ernie Smith wrote: &quot;AllMusic may have been one of the most ambitious sites of the early-internet era—and it&#x27;s one that is fundamental to our understanding of pop culture. Because the thing is, it doesn&#x27;t just track reviews or albums. It tracks styles, genres, and subgenres, along with the tone of the music and the platforms on which the music is sold. It then connects that data together, in a way that can intelligently tell you about an entire type of music, whether a massive genre like classical, or a tiny one like sadcore.&quot;

In 1996, seeking to further develop its web-based businesses, Alliance Entertainment Corp. bought All Music from Erlewine for a reported $3.5 million. He left the company after its sale. Alliance filed for bankruptcy in 1999, and its assets were acquired by Ron Burkle&#x27;s Yucaipa Equity Fund.

In 1999, All Music relocated from Big Rapids to Ann Arbor, where the staff expanded from 12 to 100 people.
By February of that year, 350,000 albums and two million tracks had been cataloged. All Music had published biographies of 30,000 artists, 120,000 record reviews, and 300 essays written by &quot;a hybrid of historians, critics, and passionate collectors&quot;.

In late 2007, AllMusic was purchased for $72 million by TiVo Corporation (known as Macrovision at the time of the sale, and as Rovi from 2009 until 2016).

In 2012, AllMusic removed all of Bryan Adams&#x27; info from the site per a request from the artist.

In 2015, AllMusic was purchased by BlinkX, later known as RhythmOne.

The AllMusic database is powered by a combination of MySQL and MongoDB.

==The All Music Guide series==
The All Media Network produced the &quot;All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide&quot; (at first released as &quot;The Experts&#x27; Guide&quot;), which includes a series of publications about various music genres. It was followed by the &quot;Required Listening&quot; series, and Annual guides. Vladimir Bogdanov is the president and the main editor of the series.

<doc id="697540" wikidata="Q804519" url="?curid=697540" title="Counts of Blois">
<text>During the Middle Ages, the counts of Blois were among the most powerful vassals of the King of France.

This title of nobility seems to have been created in 832 by Emperor Louis the Pious for William, the youngest son of Adrian, Count of Orléans. Over a few decades, the county was gathered to the royal lands of France until the end of the 9th century, before being relegated to the status of viscount.

From its autonomy around 940 to the definitive integration to the Duchy of Orleans in 1397, the county was directed by the son of the last viscount&#x27;s descendants, Theobald I. His descendants, called House of Blois ended up related to a large number of European noble families.

In 1397, the title was ceded by Count Guy II in the favor of Duke Louis I of Orléans, who was the second son of King Charles V. The very last hereditary count of Blois was his grandson, Duke Louis II, who annexed the county to the Crown lands of France when he was crowned King of France in 1498 under the name of Louis XII.

The title reappeared in 1626 when Duke Gaston of Orléans was offered a newly independent County of Blois from Orléans, but King Louis XIV refused this favor to his brother, Duke Philippe, when he received the traditional apanage in 1660.

==Carolingian county (832–c.900)==
It is likely, but not certain, that the title of count of Blois was granted before the year 832.

==Viscounts during the Robertian era (before 900–940)==
==House of Blois (956–1230)==

==House of Avesnes (1230–1241)==
&quot;Title held by House of Avesnes&quot;.

==House of Châtillon (1241–1397)==
&quot;Title held by House of Châtillon&quot;.

==House of Orléans (1397–1498, 1626–1660)==
On August 6, 1626, after a failed conspiracy in Nantes, Duke Gaston reluctantly accepted to marry the wealthy lady Duchess Marie of Montpensier, as Cardinal Richelieu wanted him to do. As a gift, he received the duchies of Orléans and of Chartres, plus the county of Blois.

When Gaston died, his Orléans-based apanage came back to the Crown. King Louis XIV decided to give it to his own younger brother, Duke Philippe, excepted Bloisian (and so the châteaux of Blois and Chambord) as well as Languedoc. Therefore, the county became definitively part of French territory.

<doc id="697544" wikidata="Q2650602" url="?curid=697544" title="Alouette 2">
<text>Alouette 2 was a Canadian research satellite launched at 04:48 UTC on November 29, 1965, by a Thor Agena rocket with Explorer 31 from the Western test range at Vandenberg AFB in California. It was (like its predecessor &quot;Alouette 1&quot;, and Explorer 31) designed to explore the ionosphere.

==History==
The name &quot;Alouette&quot; came from the French for &quot;skylark&quot; and from the title of a popular French-Canadian folk song. Alouette 2 was also known as ISIS-X since it was the first in a series of ISIS satellites: International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies. The next one was called ISIS-I.

The Alouette 2 was built up from the identical backup satellite to &quot;Alouette 1&quot;. It had many more experiments and more sophisticated support systems than the earlier satellite. It lasted for 10 years, being terminated on August 1, 1975.

RCA Victor of Montreal, Quebec, was the prime contractor; Havilland Aircraft of Toronto, Ontario, served as associate contractor.

==Post mission==
After the &quot;Alouette 2&quot; was launched, the upper stage of the rocket used to launch the satellite became a derelict object that would continue to orbit Earth for many years. , the upper stage remains in orbit.

The satellite itself became a derelict after August 1975. It too remains in earth orbit .

<doc id="697549" wikidata="Q2920770" url="?curid=697549" title="Bethel (god)">
<text>Bethel, meaning &#x27;House of El&#x27; or &#x27;House of God&#x27; in Hebrew, Phoenician and Aramaic, was the name of a god or an aspect of a god in some ancient Middle Eastern texts dating to the Assyrian, Achaemenid, and Hellenistic periods. The term appears in the Torah and the Christian Bible, but opinions differ as to whether those references are to a god or to a place.

== Historical records ==
A 1977 book by Javier Teixidor cited some early references that support viewing Bethel as a god of Aramaean or Syrian origin. The author maintains that the origin of the god&#x27;s cult is unknown, but provides what he believes to be some of the earliest references to the god: 
* Theophoric names in the seventh century BC,
* the 677 BC Esarhaddon&#x27;s Treaty with Ba&#x27;al of Tyre, which associates Bethel with what is apparently another god, Anat-Bethel, in a curse upon the Tyrians if they break the treaty: &quot;May Bethel and Anat-Bethel deliver you to a man-eating lion&quot;; and
* an Aramaic tablet from Aleppo dating to 570 BC, which contains three theophoric names of the god Bethel.

Teixodir states that the god Bethel became popular during the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which began in the seventh century BC. He found numerous references to the cult of Bethel in fifth-century Egypt literature, and notes that Bethel is mentioned, but with no details, in the Elephantine papyri and ostraca and the Hermopolis Aramaic papyri. Those papyri also mention gods with names that are variants of Bethel: &quot;Eshembethel&quot; &#x27;Name of Bethel&#x27; and &quot;Ḥerembethel&quot; &#x27;Sanctuary of Bethel&#x27; (cf. Arabic &quot;ḥaram&quot; &#x27;sanctuary&#x27;). Tawny Holm also notes that Papyrus Amherst 63 syncretizes Bethel with Yaho.

The ancient Phoenician Sanchuniathon mentions the god &quot;Baitylos&quot; as a brother of the gods El and Dagon. He later says that the god Sky devised the &quot;baitylia&quot;, having contrived to put life into stones. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any clear relationship between these two terms, however.

== Biblical references ==
The term Bethel or Beth-El appears in the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, but opinions differ as to whether these references are to a god or to a place.

Porten suspects that the Bethel mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah at chapter 48, verse 13 is a reference to the god Bethel, rather than the city named Bethel. Jeremiah 48:13 states: &quot;Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the House of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.&quot;

On the other hand, Biblical scholar Rodney Hutton says that the Bethel referred to in Jeremiah 48:13 is a location or city, and a metaphor for religious apostasy because it was the place where Jeroboam installed the golden calf.

There is further support among Biblical scholars for the view of Bethel as a location rather than a god:
* Hutton regards Bethel as a place, not a god, in his commentary on The Book of Samuel 7:16: &quot;Jacob gave the site, where God had spoken to him, the name of Bethel.&quot;
* Biblical scholar David M. Carr&#x27;s commentary on the Book of Genesis generally regards Bethel as a place, in the context it appears in 35:9-35:15 and 31.13. Also, with respect to the phrase &quot;I am the God of Bethel&quot; at 31:13, Carr states that the Hebrew is unclear, raising further doubt.
* The Rabbinical Assembly of The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, in its commentary on &quot;The Revelation at Bethel&quot; (Genesis 35:9-15) in parashah Vayishlach, follows the medieval Rabbinic commentaries and also treats Bethel as a place.

Another interpretation is that the stone which Jacob placed at Bethel, which was named House-of-God, was also a god in itself, a manifestation of the god Bethel.

==Names==
The divine name is found in composite forms Ashim-Bethel and Herem-Bethel in the archives of Elephantine, while Anat-Bethel appears as an epithet of Anat, the consort of Bethel.

 gives the personal name &quot;Bethelsharezer&quot; ( &quot;Bethel, &quot;šarra-uṣur&quot;&quot;, an Akkadian term meaning &quot;Protect the king!&quot;).

<text>Irish Canadians () are Canadian citizens who have full or partial Irish heritage including descendants who trace their ancestry to immigrants who originated in Ireland. 1.2 million Irish immigrants arrived from 1825 to 1970, and at least half of those in the period from 1831 to 1850. By 1867, they were the second largest ethnic group (after the French), and comprised 24% of Canada&#x27;s population. The 1931 national census counted 1,230,000 Canadians of Irish descent, half of whom lived in Ontario. About one-third were Catholic in 1931 and two-thirds Protestant.

The Irish immigrants were majority Protestant before the Irish famine years of the late 1840s, when far more Catholics than Protestants arrived. Even larger numbers of Catholics headed to the United States; others went to Great Britain and Australia.

Irish Canadians comprise a subgroup of European Canadians. According to the 2021 census, in terms of religion, 2,437,810 (55%) of Irish Canadians identified as Christian at the census compared to 1,905,155 identifying as secular or non-religious (43%). 1,228,640 (28%) identified as Roman Catholic and 1,190,000 (27%) identified as belonging to a Protestant denomination.

== History ==

=== Early arrival ===
The first recorded Irish presence in the area of present-day Canada dates from 1536, when Irish fishermen from Cork traveled to Newfoundland.

After the permanent settlement in Newfoundland by Irish in the late 18th and early 19th century, overwhelmingly from counties Waterford and Wexford, increased immigration of the Irish elsewhere in Canada began in the decades following the War of 1812 and formed a significant part of The Great Migration of Canada. Between 1825 and 1845, 60% of all immigrants to Canada were Irish; in 1831 alone, some 34,000 arrived in Montreal.

Between 1830 and 1850, 624,000 Irish arrived; in contextual terms, at the end of this period, the population of the provinces of Canada was 2.4 million. Besides Upper Canada (Ontario), Lower Canada (Quebec), the Maritime colonies of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, especially Saint John, were arrival points. Not all remained; many out-migrated to the United States or to Western Canada in the decades that followed. Few returned to Ireland.

During the Great Famine of Ireland (1845–52), Canada received the most destitute Irish Catholics, who left Ireland in grave circumstances. Land estate owners in Ireland would either evict landholder tenants to board on returning empty lumber ships, or in some cases pay their fares. Others left on ships from the overcrowded docks in Liverpool and Cork.

Most of the Irish immigrants who came to Canada and the United States in the nineteenth century and before were Irish speakers, with many knowing no other language on arrival.

=== Settlement ===
The great majority of Irish Catholics arrived in Grosse Isle, an island in Quebec in the St. Lawrence River, which housed the immigration reception station. Thousands died or arrived sick and were treated in the hospital (equipped for less than one hundred patients) in the summer of 1847; in fact, many ships that reached Grosse-Île had lost the bulk of their passengers and crew, and much more died in quarantine on or near the island. From Grosse-Île, most survivors were sent to Quebec City and Montreal, where the existing Irish community grew. The orphaned children were adopted into Quebec families and accordingly became Québécois, both linguistically and culturally. At the same time, ships with the starving also docked at Partridge Island, New Brunswick in similarly desperate circumstances.
A large number of the families that survived continued on to settle in Canada West (now Ontario) and provided a cheap labor pool and colonization of land in a rapidly expanding economy in the decades after their arrival.

In comparison with the Irish who went to the United States or Britain, many Irish arrivals in Canada settled in rural areas, in addition to the cities.

The Catholic Irish and Protestant (Orange) Irish were often in conflict from the 1840s. In Ontario, the Irish fought with the French for control of the Catholic Church, with the Irish successful. In that instance, the Irish sided with the Protestants to oppose the demand for French-language Catholic schools.

Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee, an Irish-Montreal journalist, became a Father of Confederation in 1867. An Irish Republican in his early years, he would moderate his view in later years and become a passionate advocate of Confederation. He was instrumental in enshrining educational rights for Catholics as a minority group in the Canadian Constitution. In 1868, he was assassinated in Ottawa. Historians are not sure who the murderer was, or what his motivations were. One theory is that a Fenian, Patrick James Whelan, was the assassin, attacking McGee for his recent anti-Raid statements. Others argue that Whelan was used as a scapegoat.

After Confederation, Irish Catholics faced more hostility, especially from Protestant Irish in Ontario, which was under the political sway of the already entrenched anti-Catholic Orange Order. The anthem &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, written and composed by Scottish immigrant and Orangeman Alexander Muir, reflects the pro-British Ulster loyalism outlook typical of the time with its disdainful view of Irish Republicanism. This only amplified with Fenian Raids of the time. As the Irish became more prosperous and newer groups arrived on Canada&#x27;s shores, tensions subsided through the remainder the latter part of the 19th century.

In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John, New Brunswick. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of refugees arrived at these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed &quot;Black 47&quot;, one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour. From 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history.

==== Protestantism and Catholicism ====
Tensions between the Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics were widespread in Canada in the 19th century, with many episodes of violence and anger, especially in Atlantic Canada and Ontario.

In New Brunswick, from 1840 to the 1860s sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. The city was shaped by Irish ghettos at York Point, and suppression of poor, Irish-speaking peoples rights lead to decades of turmoil. The division would continue to shape Saint John in years to come.

The Orange Order, with its two main tenets, anti-Catholicism and loyalty to Britain, flourished in Ontario. Largely coincident with Protestant Irish settlement, its role pervaded the political, social and community as well as religious lives of its followers. Spatially, Orange lodges were founded as Irish Protestant settlement spread north and west from its original focus on the Lake Ontario plain. Although the number of active members, and thus their influence, may have been overestimated, the Orange influence was considerable and comparable to the Catholic influence in Quebec.

In Montreal in 1853, the Orange Order organized speeches by the fiercely anti-Catholic and anti-Irish former priest Alessandro Gavazzi, resulting in a violent confrontation between the Irish and the Scots. St. Patrick&#x27;s Day processions in Toronto were often disrupted by tensions, that boiled over to the extent that the parade was cancelled permanently by the mayor in 1878 and not re-instituted until 110 years later in 1988. The Jubilee Riots of 1875 jarred Toronto in a time when sectarian tensions ran at their highest. Irish Catholics in Toronto were an embattled minority among a Protestant population that included a large Irish Protestant contingent strongly committed to the Orange Order.

== Geographical distribution ==

The graph excludes those who have only some Irish ancestry. Historian and journalist Louis-Guy Lemieux claims that about 40% of Quebecers have Irish ancestry on at least one side of their family tree. Shunned by Protestant English-speakers, it was not uncommon for Catholic Irish to settle among and intermarry with the Catholic French-speakers. Considering that many other Canadians throughout Canada likewise have Irish roots, in addition to those who may simply identify as Canadian, the total number of Canadians with some Irish ancestry extrapolated would include a significant proportion of the Canadian population.

=== Quebec ===


Irish established communities in both urban and rural Quebec. Irish immigrants arrived in large numbers in Montreal during the 1840s and were hired as labourers to build the Victoria Bridge, living in a tent city at the foot of the bridge. Here, workers unearthed a mass grave of 6,000 Irish immigrants who had died at nearby Windmill Point in the typhus outbreak of 1847–48. The Irish Commemorative Stone or &quot;Black Rock&quot;, as it is commonly known, was erected by bridge workers to commemorate the tragedy.

The Irish would go on to settle permanently in the close-knit working-class neighbourhoods of Pointe-Saint-Charles, Verdun, Saint-Henri, Griffintown and Goose Village, Montreal. With the help of Quebec&#x27;s Catholic Church, they would establish their own churches, schools, and hospitals. St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica was founded in 1847 and served Montreal&#x27;s English-speaking Catholics for over a century. Loyola College was founded by the Jesuits to serve Montreal&#x27;s mostly Irish English-speaking Catholic community in 1896. Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital was founded in the 1920s and continues to serve Montreal&#x27;s present-day English-speaking population.

The St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in Montreal is one of the oldest in North America, dating back to 1824.

The Irish would also settle in large numbers in Quebec City and establish communities in rural Quebec, particularly in Pontiac, Gatineau and Papineau where there was an active timber industry. However, most would move on to larger North American cities.

Today, many Québécois have some Irish ancestry. Examples from political leaders include Laurence Cannon, Claude Ryan, the former Premiers Daniel Johnson and Jean Charest, Georges Dor (born Georges-Henri Dore), and former Prime Ministers Louis St. Laurent and Brian Mulroney. The Irish constitute the second largest ethnic group in the province after French Canadians.

=== Ontario ===
From the times of early European settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irish had been coming to Ontario, in small numbers and in the service of New France, as missionaries, soldiers, geographers and fur trappers. After the creation of British North America in 1763, Protestant Irish, both Irish Anglicans and Ulster-Scottish Presbyterians, had been migrating over the decades to Upper Canada, some as United Empire Loyalists or directly from Ulster.

In the years after the War of 1812, increasing numbers of Irish, a growing proportion of them Catholic, were venturing to Canada to obtain work on projects such as canals, roads, early railroads and in the lumber industry. The labourers were known as ‘navvies’ and built much of the early infrastructure in the province. Settlement schemes offering cheap (or free) land brought over farming families, with many being from Munster (particularly counties Tipperary and Cork). Peter Robinson organized land settlements of Catholic tenant farmers in the 1820s to areas of rural Eastern Ontario, which helped establish Peterborough as a regional centre.

The Irish were instrumental in the building of the Rideau Canal and subsequent settlement along its route. Alongside French-Canadians, thousands of Irish laboured in difficult conditions and terrain. Hundreds, if not thousands, died from malaria.

==== Famine in Ireland ====
The Great Irish Hunger 1845–1849, had a large impact on Ontario. At its peak in the summer of 1847, boatloads of sick migrants arrived in desperate circumstances on steamers from Quebec to Bytown (soon to be Ottawa), and to ports of call on Lake Ontario, chief amongst them Kingston and Toronto, in addition to many other smaller communities across southern Ontario. Quarantine facilities were hastily constructed to accommodate them. Nurses, doctors, priests, nuns, compatriots, some politicians and ordinary citizens aided them. Thousands died in Ontario that summer alone, mostly from typhus.

How permanent a settlement was depended on circumstances. A case in point is Irish immigration to North Hastings County, Canada West, which happened after 1846. Most of the immigrants were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle&#x27;s Corner, and O&#x27;Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, most of whom were farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.

In the 1840s the major challenge for the Catholic Church was keeping the loyalty of the very poor Catholic arrivals during marches. The fear was that Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelicalization. In response the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet the need and keep people inside the faith. The Catholic church was less successful in dealing with tensions between its French and the Irish clergy; eventually the Irish took control.

==== Sectarian tensions ====
Toronto had similar numbers of both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics. Riots or conflicts repeatedly broke out from 1858 to 1878, such as during the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade or during various religious processions, which culminated in the Jubilee Riots of 1875. These tensions had increased following the organized but failed Fenian Raids at points along the American border, which arose suspicions by Protestants of Catholics&#x27; sympathies toward the Fenian cause. The Irish population essentially defined the Catholic population in Toronto until 1890, when German and French Catholics were welcomed to the city by the Irish, but the Irish were still 90% of the Catholic population. However, various powerful initiatives such as the foundation of St. Michael&#x27;s College in 1852 (where Marshall McLuhan held the chair of English until his death in 1980), three hospitals, and the most significant charitable organizations in the city (the Society of St. Vincent de Paul) and House of Providence created by Irish Catholic groups strengthened the Irish identity, transforming the Irish presence in the city into one of influence and power.

From 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John, New Brunswick resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. Orange Order parades ended in rioting with Catholics, many Irish-speaking, fighting against increased marginalization trapped in Irish ghettos at York Point and North End areas such as Portland Point. Nativist Protestants had secured their dominance over the city&#x27;s political systems at the peak of the famine, which saw the New Brunswick city&#x27;s demographics completely changed with waves of immigration. In three years alone, 1844 to 1847, 30,000 Irish came to Partridge Island, a quarantine station in the city&#x27;s harbour.
==== Economic mobility and integration ====
An economic boom and growth in the years after their arrival allowed many Irish men to obtain steady employment on the rapidly expanding railroad network, settlements developed or expanded along or close to the Grand Trunk Railroad corridor often in rural areas, allowing many to farm the relatively cheap, arable land of southern Ontario. Employment opportunities in the cities, in Toronto but elsewhere, occupations included construction, liquor processing (see Distillery District), Great Lakes shipping, and manufacturing. Women generally entered into domestic service. In more remote areas, employment centred around the Ottawa Valley timber trade which eventually extending into Northern Ontario along with railroad building and mining. There was a strong Irish rural presence in Ontario in comparison to their brethren in the northern US, but they were also numerous in the towns and cities. Later generations of these poorer immigrants were among those who rose to prominence in unions, business, judiciary, the arts and politics.

Redclift (2003) concluded that many of the one million migrants, mainly of British and Irish origin, who arrived in Canada in the mid-19th century benefited from the availability of land and absence of social barriers to mobility. This enabled them to think and feel like citizens of the new country in a way denied them back in the old country.

Akenson (1984) argued that the Canadian experience of Irish immigrants is not comparable to the American one. He contended that the numerical dominance of Protestants within the national group and the rural basis of the Irish community negated the formation of urban ghettos and allowed for a relative ease in social mobility. In comparison, the American Irish in the Northeast and Midwest were dominantly Catholic, urban dwelling, and ghettoized. There was however, the existence of Irish-centric ghettos in Toronto (Corktown, Cabbagetown, Trinity Niagara, the Ward) at the fringes of urban development, at least for the first few decades after the famine and in the case of Trefann Court, a holdout against public housing and urban renewal, up to the 1970s. This was also the case in other Canadian cities with significant Irish Catholic populations such as Montreal, Ottawa and Saint John.

Likewise the new labour historians believe that the rise of the Knights of Labor caused the Orange and Catholic Irish in Toronto to resolve their generational hatred and set about to form a common working-class culture. This theory presumes that Irish-Catholic culture was of little value, to be rejected with such ease. Nicolson (1985) argues that neither theory is valid. He says that in the ghettos of Toronto the fusion of an Irish peasant culture with traditional Catholism produced a new, urban, ethno-religious vehicle – Irish Tridentine Catholism. This culture spread from the city to the hinterland and, by means of metropolitan linkage, throughout Ontario. Privatism created a closed Irish society, and, while Irish Catholics cooperated in labour organizations for the sake of their families&#x27; future, they never shared in the development of a new working-class culture with their old Orange enemies.

McGowan argues that between 1890 and 1920, the city&#x27;s Catholics experienced major social, ideological, and economic changes that allowed them to integrate into Toronto society and shake off their second-class status. The Irish Catholics (in contrast to the French) strongly supported Canada&#x27;s role in the First World War. They broke out of the ghetto and lived in all of Toronto&#x27;s neighbourhoods. Starting as unskilled labourers, they used high levels of education to move up and were well represented among the lower middle class. Most dramatically, they intermarried with Protestants at an unprecedented rate.

==== Confederation ====
With Canadian Confederation in 1867, Catholics were granted a separate school board. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, Irish immigration to Ontario continued but a slower pace, much of it family reunification. Out-migration of Irish in Ontario (along with others) occurred during this period following economic downturns, available new land and mining booms in the US or the Canadian West. The reverse is true of those with Irish descent who migrated to Ontario from the Maritimes and Newfoundland seeking work, mostly since World War II.

In 1877, a breakthrough in Irish Canadian Protestant-Catholic relations occurred in London, Ontario. This was the founding of the Irish Benevolent Society, a brotherhood of Irishmen and women of both Catholic and Protestant faiths. The society promoted Irish Canadian culture, but it was forbidden for members to speak of Irish politics when meeting. Today, the society is still operating.

Some writers have assumed that the Irish in 19th-century North America were impoverished. DiMatteo (1992), using evidence from probate records in 1892, shows this is untrue. Irish-born and Canadian-born Irish accumulated wealth in a similar way, and that being Irish was not an economic disadvantage by the 1890s. Immigrants from earlier decades may well have experienced greater economic difficulties, but in general the Irish in Ontario in the 1890s enjoyed levels of wealth commensurate with the rest of the populace.

By 1901 Ontario Irish Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians were among the most likely to own homes, while Anglicans did only moderately well, despite their traditional association with Canada&#x27;s elite. French-speaking Catholics in Ontario achieved wealth and status less readily than Protestants and Irish Catholics. Although differences in attainment existed between people of different religious denominations, the difference between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants in urban Canada was relatively insignificant.

==== 20th century ====
Ciani (2008) concludes that support of World War I fostered an identity among Irish Catholics as loyal citizens and helped integrate them into the social fabric of the nation. Rev. Michael Fallon, the Catholic bishop of London, sided with the Protestants against the French Catholics. His primary motive was to advance the cause of Irish Catholics in Canada and abroad; he had significant support from the Vatican. He opposed the French Canadian Catholics, especially by opposing bilingual education. French Canadians did not participate in Fallon&#x27;s efforts to support the war effort and became more marginalized in Ontario politics and society.

During the Troubles (1969–1998) in Northern Ireland, although not as responsive as Irish Americans, Irish Canadians nevertheless responded to the conflict. In August 1969, some 150 Irish Canadians in Toronto announced that they intended to send money, which could be used to buy guns if necessary, to the Catholic women and children of the Bogside in Derry. After the outbreak of the conflict, the Irish Republican Clubs were established in America and Canada to support the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) cause. Much of the IRA support in Canada was based in Montreal, Toronto, and southern Ontario. Canadian IRA supporters raised money to secretly purchase weapons, most notably the detonators used in Canadian mining sites, for the IRA armed campaign.

At the same time, Irish Canadians also provided a role for loyalist paramilitaries (mostly the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association), owing to its considerable Ulster Protestant population in Ontario and Orange Lodges across the country. Sociologist Steve Bruce described the support networks in Canada as &quot;the main source of support for loyalism outside the United Kingdom . . . Ontario is to Ulster Protestants what Boston is to Irish Catholics.&quot; After the Troubles began, various Canadian loyalist organisations sprang to life to provide the &#x27;besieged&#x27; Protestants with the resources to arm themselves. Between 1979 and 1986, loyalist paramilitaries received 100 machine guns and many rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition from Canadian sources. These weapons were a boost to the loyalist armed campaign and contributed to the many numbers of Catholic civilian casualties.

==== Present ====
Today, the impact of the heavy 19th-century Irish immigration to Ontario is evident as those who report Irish extraction in the province number close to 2 million people or almost half the total Canadians who claim Irish ancestry. In 2004, March 17 was proclaimed &quot;Irish Heritage Day&quot; by the Ontario Legislature in recognition of the immense Irish contribution to the development of the Province.

Ontario sustains a network of Irish language enthusiasts, many of whom see the language as part of their ethnic heritage. Ontario is also home to Gaeltacht Bhuan Mheiriceá Thuaidh (the Permanent North American Gaeltacht), an area which hosts cultural activities for Irish speakers and learners and has been recognized by the Irish government.

With the downturn of Ireland&#x27;s economy in 2010, many Irish people came to Canada looking for work, or to pre-arranged employment.

There are many communities in Ontario that are named after places and last names of Ireland, including Ballinafad, Ballyduff, Ballymote, Cavan, Connaught, Connellys, Dalton, Donnybrook, Dublin, Dundalk, Dunnville, Enniskillen, Erinsville, Galway, Hagarty, Irish Lake, Kearney, Keenansville, Kennedys, Killaloe, Killarney, Limerick, Listowel, Lucan, Maguire, Malone, McGarry, Moffat, Mullifarry, Munster, Navan, New Dublin, O&#x27;Connell, Oranmore, Quinn Settlement, Ripley, Shamrock, Tara, South Monaghan, Waterford and Westport.

=== New Brunswick ===

Saint John has often been called &quot;Canada&#x27;s Irish City&quot;. In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland arrived to Saint John. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of Famine refugees arrived. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed &quot;Black 47&quot;, one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.

After the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 New Brunswick was originally named New Ireland with the capital to be in Saint John.

By 1850, the Irish Catholic community constituted Saint John&#x27;s largest ethnic group. In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 55 per cent of Saint John&#x27;s residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born fathers. However, the city was split with tensions between Irish Catholics and Unionist Protestants. From the 1840s onward, Sectarian riots were rampant in the city with many poor, Irish-speaking immigrants clustered at York Point.

In 1967, at Reed&#x27;s Point at the foot of Prince William Street, St. Patrick&#x27;s Square was created to honour citizens of Irish heritage. The square overlooks Partridge Island, and a replica of the island&#x27;s Celtic Cross stands in the square. Then in 1997 the park was refurbished by the city with a memorial marked by the city&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Society and Famine 150 which was unveiled by Hon. Mary Robinson, president of Ireland. The St. Patrick&#x27;s Society of Saint John, founded in 1819, is still active today.

The Miramichi River valley, received a significant Irish immigration in the years before the famine. These settlers tended to be better off and better educated than the later arrivals, who came out of desperation. Though coming after the Scottish and the French Acadians, they made their way in this new land, intermarrying with the Catholic Highland Scots, and to a lesser extent, with the Acadians. Some, like Martin Cranney, held elective office and became the natural leaders of their augmented Irish community after the arrival of the famine immigrants. The early Irish came to the Miramichi because it was easy to get to with lumber ships stopping in Ireland before returning to Chatham and Newcastle, and because it provided economic opportunities, especially in the lumber industry. They were commonly Irish speakers, and in the eighteen thirties and eighteen forties there were many Irish-speaking communities along the New Brunswick and Maine frontier.

Long a timber-exporting colony, New Brunswick became the destination of thousands of Irish immigrants in the form of refugees fleeing the famines during the mid-19th century as the timber cargo vessels provided cheap passage when returning empty to the colony. Quarantine hospitals were located on islands at the mouth of the colony&#x27;s two major ports, Saint John (Partridge Island) and Chatham-Newcastle (Middle Island), where many would ultimately die. Those who survived settled on marginal agricultural lands in the Miramichi River valley and in the Saint John River and Kennebecasis River valleys. The difficulty of farming these regions, however, saw many Irish immigrant families moving to the colony&#x27;s major cities within a generation or to Portland, Maine or Boston.

Saint John and Chatham, New Brunswick saw large numbers of Irish migrants, changing the nature and character of both municipalities. Today, all of the amalgamated city of Miramichi continues to host a large annual Irish festival. Indeed, Miramichi is one of the most Irish communities in North America, second possibly only to Saint John or Boston.

As in Newfoundland, the Irish language survived as a community language in New Brunswick into the twentieth century. The 1901 census specifically enquired as to the mother tongue of the respondents, defining it as a language commonly spoken in the home. There were several individuals and a scattering of families in the census who described Irish as their first language and as being spoken at home. In other respects the respondents had less in common, some being Catholic and some Protestant.

=== Prince Edward Island ===
For years, Prince Edward Island had been divided between Irish Catholics and British Protestants (which included Ulster Scots from Northern Ireland). In the latter half of the 20th century, this sectarianism diminished and was ultimately destroyed recently after two events occurred. First, the Catholic and Protestant school boards were merged into one secular institution; second, the practice of electing two MLAs for each provincial riding (one Catholic and one Protestant) was ended.

==== History ====
According to professor &quot;emeritus&quot;, Brendan O&#x27;Grady, a history professor at the University of Prince Edward Island for fifty years, before the Great Famine of 1845–1852, in which a million Irish died and another million emigrated, the majority of Irish immigrants had already arrived on Prince Edward Island. One coffin ship landed on the Island in 1847.

The first waves of Irish immigrants took place between 1763 and 1880. when ten thousand Irish immigrants arrived on the Island. From 1800 to 1850, &quot;10,000 immigrants from every county in Ireland&quot; had settled in Prince Edward Island and represented 25% of the Island population by 1850.

The British divided St John&#x27;s Island, following 1763, was divided into dozens of lots that were granted to &quot;influential individuals in Britain&quot; with conditions for land ownership including the settlement of each lot by 1787 by British Protestants.

From 1767 through 1810 English speaking Irish Protestants were brought to the colony as colonial pioneers to establish the British system of government with its institutions and laws. The Irish-born Captain Walter Patterson was the first governor of St John&#x27;s Island from 1769 until he was removed from office by Whitehall in 1787. According to the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot;, what became known as the century-long &quot;land question&quot;, originated with Patterson&#x27;s failure as administrator of a colony whose lands were owned by a monopoly of British absentee proprietors who demanded rent from their Island tenants.

In May 1830 the first ship of families from County Monaghan, in the province of Ulster, Ireland accompanied by Father John MacDonald who had recruited them, arrived on the Island to settle in Fort Augustus, on the lots inherited by Father John MacDonald from his father Captain John MacDonald. From the 1830s through 1848, 3,000 people emigrated from County Monaghan to PEI in what became known as the Monaghan settlements, forming the largest group of Irish to arrive on the Island in the first half of the 19th century.

=== Newfoundland ===


The large Irish Catholic element in Newfoundland in the 19th century played a major role in Newfoundland history, and developed a strong local culture of their own. They were in repeated political conflict—sometimes violent—with the Protestant Scots-Irish &quot;Orange&quot; element.

In 1806, The Benevolent Irish Society (BIS) was founded as a philanthropic organization in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland for locals of Irish birth or ancestry, regardless of religious persuasion. The BIS was founded as a charitable, fraternal, middle-class social organization, on the principles of &quot;benevolence and philanthropy&quot;, and had as its original objective to provide the necessary skills which would enable the poor to better themselves. Today the society is still active in Newfoundland and is the oldest philanthropic organization in North America.

Newfoundland Irish Catholics, mainly from the southeast of Ireland, settled in the cities (mainly St. John&#x27;s and parts of the surrounding Avalon Peninsula), while British Protestants, mainly from the West Country, settled in small fishing communities. Over time, the Irish Catholics became wealthier than their Protestant neighbours, which gave incentive for Protestant Newfoundlanders to join the Orange Order. In 1903, Sir William Coaker founded the Fisherman&#x27;s Protective Union in an Orange Hall in Herring Neck. Furthermore, during the term of Commission of Government (1934–1949), the Orange Lodge was one of only a handful of &quot;democratic&quot; organizations that existed in the Dominion of Newfoundland. In 1948, a referendum was held in Newfoundland as to its political future; the Irish Catholics mainly supported a return to independence for Newfoundland as it existed before 1934, while the Protestants mainly supported joining the Canadian Confederation. Newfoundland then joined Canada by a 52–48% margin, and with an influx of Protestants into St. John&#x27;s after the closure of the east coast cod fishery in the 1990s, the main issues have become one of Rural vs. Urban interests rather than anything ethnic or religious.

To Newfoundland, the Irish gave the still-familiar family names of southeast Ireland: Walsh, Power, Murphy, Ryan, Whelan, Phelan, O&#x27;Brien, Kelly, Hanlon, Neville, Bambrick, Halley, Houlihan, Hogan, Dillon, Byrne, Quigley, Burke, and FitzGerald. Irish place names are less common, many of the island&#x27;s more prominent landmarks having already been named by early French and English explorers. Nevertheless, Newfoundland&#x27;s Ballyhack, Cappahayden, Kilbride, St. Bride&#x27;s, Port Kirwan, Waterford Valley, Windgap and Skibereen all point to Irish antecedents.

Along with traditional names, the Irish brought their native tongue. Newfoundland is the only place outside Europe with its own distinctive name in the Irish language, &quot;Talamh an Éisc&quot;, &quot;the land of fish&quot;. Eastern Newfoundland was one of the few places outside Ireland where the Irish language was spoken by a majority of the population as their primary language. Newfoundland Irish was of Munster derivation and was still in use by older people into the first half of the twentieth century. It has influenced Newfoundland English both lexically (in words like &quot;angishore&quot; and &quot;sleveen&quot;) and grammatically (the &quot;after&quot; past-tense construction, for instance).

The family names, the features and colouring, the predominant Catholic religion, the prevalence of Irish music – even the dialect and accent of the people – are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author Tim Pat Coogan has described Newfoundland as &quot;the most Irish place in the world outside of Ireland&quot;.

The United Irish Uprising occurred during April 1800, in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland where up to 400 Irishmen had taken the secret oath of the Society of the United Irishmen. The Colony of Newfoundland rebellion was the only one to occur which the British administration linked directly to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The uprising in St. John&#x27;s was significant in that it was the first occasion on which the Irish in Newfoundland deliberately challenged the authority of the state, and because the British feared that it might not be the last. It earned for Newfoundland a reputation as a &quot;Transatlantic Tipperary&quot;–a far-flung but semi-Irish colony with the potential for political chaos. Seven Irishman were hanged by the crown because of the uprising.

According to the 2001 Canadian census, the largest ethnic group in Newfoundland and Labrador is English (39.4%), followed by Irish (39.7%), Scottish (6.0%), French (5.5%), and First Nations (3.2%). While half of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as &quot;Canadian&quot;, 38% report their ethnicity as &quot;Newfoundlander&quot; in a 2003 Statistics Canada Ethnic Diversity Survey.

Accordingly, the largest single religious denomination by number of adherents according to the 2001 census was the Roman Catholic Church, at 36.9% of the province&#x27;s population (187,405 members). The major Protestant denominations make up 59.7% of the population, with the largest group being the Anglican Church of Canada at 26.1% of the total population (132,680 members), the United Church of Canada at 17.0% (86,420 members), and the Salvation Army at 7.9% (39,955 members), with other Protestant denominations in much smaller numbers. The Pentecostal Church made up 6.7% of the population with 33,840 members. Non-Christians made up only 2.7% of the total population, with the majority of those respondents indicating &quot;no religion&quot; (2.5% of the total population).

According to the Statistics Canada 2006 census, 21.5% of Newfoundlanders claim Irish ancestry (other major groups in the province include 43.2% English, 7% Scottish, and 6.1% French). In 2006, Statistics Canada have listed the following ethnic origins in Newfoundland; 216,340 English, 107,390 Irish, 34,920 Scottish, 30,545 French, 23,940 North American Indian etc. 
Most of the Irish migration to Newfoundland was pre-famine (late 18th century and early 19th century), and two centuries of isolation have led many of Irish descent in Newfoundland to consider their ethnic identity &quot;Newfoundlander&quot;, and not &quot;Irish&quot;, although they are aware of the cultural links between the two.

=== Nova Scotia ===
About one Nova Scotian in four is of Irish descent, and there are good tracing facilities for genealogists and family historians.

Many Nova Scotians who claim Irish ancestry are of Presbyterian Ulster-Scottish descent. William Sommerville (1800–1878) was ordained in the Irish Reformed Presbyterian Church and in 1831 was sent as a missionary to New Brunswick. There, with missionary Alexander Clarke, he formed the Reformed Presbytery of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1832 before becoming minister of the West Cornwallis congregation in Grafton, Nova Scotia, in 1833. Although a strict Covenanter, Sommerville initially ministered to Presbyterians generally over a very extensive district. Presbyterian centres included Colchester County, Nova Scotia.

Catholic Irish settlement in Nova Scotia was traditionally restricted to the urban Halifax area. Halifax, founded in 1749, was estimated to be about 16% Irish Catholic in 1767 and about 9% by the end of the 18th century. Although the harsh laws enacted against them were generally not enforced, Irish Catholics had no legal rights in the early history of the city. Catholic membership in the legislature was nonexistent until near the end of the century. In 1829 Lawrence O&#x27;Connor Doyle, of Irish parentage, became the first of his faith to become a lawyer and helped to overcome opposition to the Irish.

There were also rural Irish village settlements throughout most of Guysborough County, such as the Erinville (meaning Irishville) /Salmon River Lake/Ogden/Bantry district (Bantry being named after Bantry Bay, County Cork, Ireland but abandoned since the 19th century for better farmland in places like Erinville/Salmon River Lake). In this area Irish last names are prevalent and an Irish influence is apparent in the accent, the traditional music of the area, food, religion (Roman Catholic) and lingering traces of the Irish language. In Antigonish County there are other villages of Irish provenance, and still others can be found on Cape Breton Island, in places such as New Waterford, Rocky Bay and Glace Bay.

Murdoch (1998) notes that the popular image of Cape Breton Island as a last bastion of Scottish Highland and specifically Gaelic culture distorts the complex history of the island since the 16th century. The original Mi&#x27;kmaq inhabitants, Acadian French, Lowland Scots, Irish, Loyalists from New England, and English have all contributed to a history which has included cultural, religious, and political conflict as well as cooperation and synthesis. The Highland Scots became the largest community in the early 19th century, and their heritage has survived in diminished form.

=== Prairies ===
While some influential Canadian politicians anticipated that the assisted migrations of Irish settlers would lead to the establishment of a &#x27;New Ireland&#x27; on Canada&#x27;s prairies, or at least raise the profile of the country&#x27;s potential as a suitable destination for immigrants, neither happened. Sheppard (1990) looks at the efforts in the 1880s of Quaker philanthropist James Hack Tuke as well as those of Thomas Connolly, the Irish emigration agent for the Canadian government. The Irish press continued to warn potential emigrants of the dangers and hardships of life in Canada and encouraged would-be emigrants to settle instead in the United States.

Irish migration to the Prairie Provinces had two distinct components: those who came via eastern Canada or the United States, and those who came directly from Ireland. Many of the Irish-Canadians who came west were fairly well assimilated, in that they spoke English and understood British customs and law, and tended to be regarded as a part of English Canada. However, this picture was complicated by the religious division. Many of the original &quot;English&quot; Canadian settlers in the Red River Colony were fervent Irish Loyalist Protestants, and members of the Orange Order. They clashed with Catholic Métis leader Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government during the Red River Rebellion, and as a result Thomas Scott was executed, inflaming sectarian tensions in the east. At this time and during the course of the following decades, many of the Catholic Irish were fighting for separate Catholic schools in the west, but sometimes clashed with the Francophone element of the Catholic community during the Manitoba Schools Question. After World War I and the &quot;de facto&quot; resolution of the religious schools issue, any eastern Irish-Canadians moving west blended in totally with the majority society. The small group of Irish-born who arrived in the second half of the 20th century tended to be urban professionals, a stark contrast to the agrarian pioneers who had come before.

About 10% of the population of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both individually and collectively, the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity – the Catholic Church and the Orange Order – served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share their vision of how the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.

<doc id="697561" wikidata="Q38610" url="?curid=697561" title="Dominion of Newfoundland">
<text>Newfoundland was a British dominion in eastern North America, today the modern Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It included the island of Newfoundland, and Labrador on the continental mainland. Newfoundland was one of the original dominions under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, and accordingly enjoyed a constitutional status equivalent to the other dominions of the time. Its dominion status was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, although the statute was not otherwise applicable to Newfoundland.

In 1934, Newfoundland became the only dominion to give up its self-governing status, which ended 79 years of self-government. The abolition of self-government came about because of a crisis in Newfoundland&#x27;s public finances in 1932. Newfoundland had accumulated a significant amount of debt by building a railway across the island, which was completed in the 1890s, and by raising its own regiment during the First World War. In November 1932, the government warned that Newfoundland would default on payments on the public debt. The British government quickly established the Newfoundland Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the position. The commission&#x27;s report, published in October 1933, recommended that Newfoundland give up self-government temporarily and allow the United Kingdom to administer it by an appointed commission.

The Newfoundland parliament accepted the recommendations; it then presented a petition to the King to ask for the suspension of the constitution and the appointment of commissioners to administer the government until the country became self-supporting again. To enable compliance with the request, the British Parliament passed the &quot;Newfoundland Act, 1933&quot;, and on 16 February 1934, the British government appointed six commissioners, three from Newfoundland and three from the United Kingdom, with the governor as chairman. The system of a six-member Commission of Government continued to govern Newfoundland until Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 to become Canada&#x27;s tenth province.

==Name and national symbols==

The official name of the dominion was &quot;Newfoundland&quot; and not, as was sometimes reported, &quot;Dominion of Newfoundland&quot;. The distinction is apparent in many statutes, most notably the Statute of Westminster that listed the full name of each realm, including the &quot;Dominion of New Zealand&quot;, the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;, and &quot;Newfoundland&quot;.


The Newfoundland Red Ensign was used as the &quot;de facto&quot; national flag of the dominion until the legislature adopted the Union Flag on 15 May 1931.

The anthem of the dominion was the &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot;, written by British colonial governor Sir Cavendish Boyle in 1902 during his administration of Newfoundland (1901 to 1904). It was adopted as the dominion&#x27;s anthem on 20 May 1904, until confederation with Canada in 1949. In 1980, the province of Newfoundland re-adopted the song as a provincial anthem. The &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot; continues to be heard at public events in the province; however, only the first and last verses are traditionally sung.

== Political origins ==

Newfoundland was the oldest English colony in North America, being claimed by John Cabot for King Henry VII, and again by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583. It gradually acquired European settlement; in 1825, it was formally recognised as a Crown colony by the British government. The British government granted representative government in 1832, and responsible government in 1854. In 1855, Philip Francis Little, a native of Prince Edward Island, won a parliamentary majority over Sir Hugh Hoyles and the Conservatives. Little formed the first administration from 1855 to 1858.

Newfoundland sent two delegates to the Quebec Conference in 1864 which resulted in Canadian Confederation, but the option of joining was not popular in Newfoundland. In the 1869 general election, Newfoundlanders rejected confederation with Canada. Sir John Thompson, Prime Minister of Canada, came very close to negotiating Newfoundland&#x27;s entry into Confederation in 1892.

Newfoundland remained a colony until the 1907 Imperial Conference resolved to confer dominion status on all self-governing colonies in attendance. The annual holiday of Dominion Day was celebrated each 26 September to commemorate the occasion.

== First World War and afterwards ==

Newfoundland&#x27;s own regiment, the 1st Newfoundland Regiment, fought in the First World War. On 1 July 1916, the German Army wiped out most of that regiment at Beaumont Hamel on the first day on the Somme, inflicting 90 percent casualties. Yet the regiment went on to serve with distinction in several subsequent battles, earning the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;. Despite people&#x27;s pride in the accomplishments of the regiment, Newfoundland&#x27;s war debt and pension responsibility for the regiment and the cost of maintaining a trans-island railway led to increased and ultimately unsustainable government debt in the post-war era.

After the war, Newfoundland along with the other dominions sent a separate delegation to the Paris Peace Conference but, unlike the other dominions, Newfoundland neither signed the Treaty of Versailles in her own right nor sought separate membership in the League of Nations.

In the 1920s, political scandals wracked the dominion. In 1923, the attorney general arrested Newfoundland&#x27;s prime minister, Sir Richard Squires, on charges of corruption. Despite his release soon after on bail, a commission of enquiry, headed by Thomas Hollis-Walker, reviewed the scandal. Soon after, the Squires government fell. Squires returned to power in 1928 because of the unpopularity of his successors, the pro-business Walter Stanley Monroe and (briefly) Frederick C. Alderdice (Monroe&#x27;s cousin), but found himself governing a country suffering from the Great Depression.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council resolved Newfoundland&#x27;s long-standing Labrador boundary dispute with Canada to the satisfaction of Newfoundland and against Canada (and, in particular, contrary to the wishes of Quebec, the province that bordered Labrador) with a ruling on 1 April 1927. Prior to 1867, the Quebec North Shore portion of the &quot;Labrador coast&quot; had shuttled back and forth between the colonies of Lower Canada and Newfoundland. Maps up to 1927 showed the coastal region as part of Newfoundland, with an undefined boundary. The Privy Council ruling established a boundary along the drainage divide separating waters that flowed through the territory to the Labrador coast, although following two straight lines from the Romaine River along the 52nd parallel, then south near 57 degrees west longitude to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Quebec has long rejected the outcome, and Quebec&#x27;s provincially issued maps do not mark the boundary in the same way as boundaries with Ontario and New Brunswick.

Newfoundland only gradually implemented its status as a self-governing dominion. In 1921, it officially established the position of High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (for which Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring had already assumed the role in 1918), and it adopted a national flag and established an external affairs department in 1931. Although the legislature of Newfoundland gave its assent to the passage of the Statute of Westminster, when the Statute was finalised the Newfoundland delegation requested that it not come into effect in Newfoundland until the legislature had consented to the application of the statute. The legislature of Newfoundland never gave its consent, so the statute was not in force in Newfoundland until it joined Canada.

== End of responsible government ==

As a small country which relied primarily upon the export of fish, paper, and minerals, Newfoundland was hit hard by the Great Depression. Economic frustration combined with anger over government corruption led to a general dissatisfaction with democratic government. On 5 April 1932, a crowd of 10,000 people marched on the Colonial Building (seat of the House of Assembly) and forced Prime Minister Squires to flee. Squires lost an election held later in 1932. The next government, led once more by Alderdice, called upon the British government to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland&#x27;s likelihood of defaulting on its war-debt payments, established the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland&#x27;s political culture as intrinsically corrupt and its economic prospects as bleak, and advocated the abolition of responsible government and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report&#x27;s recommendations, Alderdice&#x27;s government voted itself out of existence in December 1933.

In 1934, the British Parliament passed the &quot;Newfoundland Act, 1933&quot; which suspended Newfoundland&#x27;s Legislature and established the Commission of Government. Letters patent passed under the act provided that Newfoundland was ruled by the governor, who reported to the Colonial Secretary in London, and the commission, appointed by the British government. Newfoundland remained a dominion in name only. The Newfoundland Supreme Court held that the surrender of responsible government and the establishment of the commission of government &quot;... reduces the Island to the status of a pure Crown colony&quot;.

== Second World War ==

The severe worldwide Great Depression persisted until the Second World War broke out in 1939.

Given Newfoundland&#x27;s strategic location in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Allies (especially the United States of America) built many military bases there. Large numbers of unskilled men gained the first paycheques they had seen in years by working on construction and in dockside crews. National income doubled as an economic boom took place in the Avalon Peninsula and to a lesser degree in Gander, Botwood, and Stephenville. The United States became the main supplier, and American money and influence diffused rapidly from the military, naval, and air bases. Prosperity returned to the fishing industry by 1943. Government revenues, aided by inflation and new income, quadrupled, even though Newfoundland had tax rates much lower than those in Canada, Britain, or the United States. To the astonishment of all, Newfoundland started financing loans to London. Wartime prosperity ended the long depression and reopened the question of political status.

The American Bases Act became law in Newfoundland on 11 June 1941, with American personnel creating drastic social change on the island. This included significant intermarriage between Newfoundland women and American personnel.

In October 1943, the weather station Kurt was erected in Newfoundland, marking Nazi Germany&#x27;s only armed operation on land in North America.

A new political party formed in Newfoundland to support closer ties with the US, the Economic Union Party, which Karl McNeil Earle characterizes as &quot;a short-lived but lively movement for economic union with the United States&quot;. Advocates of union with Canada denounced the Economic Union Party as republican, disloyal and anti-British. No American initiative for union was ever created.

== National Convention and referendums ==
As soon as prosperity returned during the war, agitation began to end the commission. Newfoundland, with a population of 313,000 (plus 5,200 in Labrador), seemed too small to be independent. In 1945, London announced that a Newfoundland National Convention would be elected to advise on what constitutional choices should be voted on by referendum. Union with the United States was a possibility, but Britain rejected the option and offered instead two options: return to dominion status or continuation of the unpopular Commission. Canada cooperated with Britain to ensure that the option of closer ties with America was not on the referendum.

In 1946, an election took place to determine the membership of the Newfoundland National Convention, charged with deciding the future of Newfoundland. The Convention voted to hold a referendum to decide between continuing the Commission of Government or restoring responsible government. Joey Smallwood was a well-known radio personality, writer, organizer, and nationalist who had long criticized British rule. He became the leader of the confederates and moved for the inclusion of a third option – that of confederation with Canada. The Convention defeated his motion, but he did not give up, instead gathering more than 5,000 petition signatures within a fortnight, which he sent to London through the governor. Britain insisted that it would not give Newfoundland any further financial assistance, but added this third option of having Newfoundland join Canada to the ballot. After much debate, the first referendum took place on 3 June 1948, to decide between continuing with the Commission of Government, reverting to dominion status, or joining Canadian Confederation.

Three parties participated in the referendum campaign: Smallwood&#x27;s Confederate Association campaigned for the confederation option while in the anti-confederation campaign Peter Cashin&#x27;s Responsible Government League and Chesley Crosbie&#x27;s Economic Union Party (both of which called for a vote for responsible government) took part. No party advocated petitioning Britain to continue the Commission of Government. Canada had issued an invitation to join it on generous financial terms. Smallwood was the leading proponent of confederation with Canada, insisting, &quot;Today we are more disposed to feel that our very manhood, our very creation by God, entitles us to standards of life no lower than our brothers on the mainland.&quot; Due to persistence, he succeeded in having the Canada option on the referendum. His main opponents were Cashin and Crosbie. Cashin, a former finance minister, led the Responsible Government League, warning against cheap Canadian imports and the high Canadian income tax. Crosbie, a leader of the fishing industry, led the Party for Economic Union with the United States, seeking responsible government first, to be followed by closer ties with the United States, which could be a major source of capital.

The result proved inconclusive, with 44.5 percent supporting the restoration of dominion status, 41.1 percent for confederation with Canada, and 14.3 percent for continuing the Commission of Government. Due to no option getting at least 50 percent of the vote, a second referendum with the top two options from the first referendum was scheduled to be held on 22 July. The second referendum, on 22 July 1948, asked Newfoundlanders to choose between confederation and dominion status, and produced a vote of 52 to 48 percent for confederation. Newfoundland joined Canada in the final hours of 31 March 1949.

<text>A tables, ladders, and chairs match, often abbreviated as TLC, is a type of professional wrestling match that originated within the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE).

The TLC match is a variation of a ladder match, which is modified to co-emphasize two other weapons: tables and chairs. The goal is to acquire the item (usually championship belts) which starts the match suspended above the ring. A TLC match can be seen as a more complicated ladder match, where tables and chairs, along with ladders, can also be used as legal foreign objects.

TLC matches that could also exist as a variation of a hardcore match, where tables, ladders, and chairs can also be used as legal foreign objects, but the only way to win this variation of the TLC match is by pinfall or submission.

== Origin ==
The match originates around the tag teams of The Dudley Boyz, The Hardy Boyz, and Edge and Christian. The particular weapons of tables, ladders and chairs were seen as unique to each team&#x27;s style. The Hardys were seen as high-flying daredevils with a penchant for using ladders, the Dudley Boyz would often use tables as weapons, and Edge and Christian became notable for using steel chairs in tandem against opponents.

== WWF/WWE ==
World Wrestling Federation created and adapted the matches to make it known today as a TLC match. The idea of the TLC match in WWF had its origins in a tag team ladder match for the managerial services of Terri Runnels between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), at No Mercy 1999 during the Attitude Era, with the audience giving all four wrestlers a standing ovation at the end of the match. The move catapulted both tag teams to the top of the tag team world. The following months had The Hardy Boyz face The Dudley Boyz, (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) at the Royal Rumble 2000, in a violent and chaotic tag-team Tables match, where ladders and chairs were used as much as tables, had similar success.

The three teams would be known for their three respective foreign objects, as well as the hardcore wrestling styles associated therein: the Dudley Boyz often Powerbombed or Death Dropped their opponents through tables during or after matches (usually brought out by Bubba Ray telling D-Von to &quot;get the tables&quot;); the Hardy Boyz, in singles matches, challenged main-event singles wrestlers (such as The Undertaker) in ladder matches, considered at that time to be the &quot;signature match&quot; of the team (as they were both high-flyers, they specialized with high spots, and doing them off the top of ladders amplified their effectiveness), while Edge and Christian developed the &quot;con-chair-to&quot;, which involved the two hitting an opponent&#x27;s head simultaneously, on opposite sides, with chairs. Eventually, the three teams were brought together in a triangle ladder match at WrestleMania 2000, in what was the forerunner of the TLC in terms of the spots involved (tables were involved in some of the major spots, including Jeff&#x27;s big Swanton Bomb on Bubba Ray far from the ring, even though it was technically a ladder match).

The first official TLC match was contested between these three teams using the weapons that they had made famous at SummerSlam 2000. These matches frequently involved members of these three teams, and are largely remembered for the dangerous stunts, object destruction, chaotic pace, injuries and length.

The second TLC match happened at WrestleMania X-Seven, with each of the three teams joined by a third member who tried to help their team win the match (Matt and Jeff were joined by Lita, who had also been with them for the SummerSlam bout, Bubba Ray and D-Von were joined by their half-brother Spike, and Edge and Christian were joined by Rhyno). Lita hit Spike Dudley with a chair shot to the head, Christian and D-Von Dudley hung 20 feet in the air, Bubba Ray Dudley and Matt Hardy jumped off a toppling ladder (pushed over by Rhyno) and crashed through 4 stacked tables on ringside, and Edge speared a hanging Jeff Hardy by jumping off a 20-ft ladder. After TLC I and II, every subsequent TLC match was toned down to reduce the high risks and dangers they posed.

TLC III on the May 24, 2001 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; featured the usual three teams, plus the team of Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit, who defended their tag team championship.

In the fourth TLC match on the October 7, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, four tag teams had drawn, as a result of &quot;Raw roulette&quot; (where the match type of every match of the card was determined by spinning a wheel), a TLC match. The match saw defending champions Kane and The Hurricane putting their World Tag Team titles up against the teams of Christian and Chris Jericho, Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley, and Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam. Being the veterans that they were to the match itself, general manager Eric Bischoff allowed Hardy, Christian and Dudley to choose their own partners, as their former partners Matt Hardy, Edge, and D-Von Dudley were unavailable as SmackDown! wrestlers. Prior to the match, The Hurricane was taken out backstage causing Kane to defend the titles by himself. A previous match that same episode caused Jim Ross to call the match by himself, where Kane successfully overcame the handicap to retain the titles.

On the January 16, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE held its fifth TLC match, the first in over three years. Edge, who was in his fourth TLC match successfully defended his WWE Championship against Ric Flair, who was in his first ever Ladder match of any kind. It was the first TLC match to be held in singles competition and the first to have the WWE Championship on the line. TLC VI at Unforgiven 2006 saw John Cena winning the WWE Championship from Edge. TLC VII was held at One Night Stand 2008 saw Edge winning the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Undertaker and (kayfabe) banishing him from WWE. TLC VIII at SummerSlam 2009 saw CM Punk winning the World Heavyweight Championship from TLC veteran Jeff Hardy. This marked the first time Jeff Hardy had participated in a singles TLC match.

In December 2009, WWE introduced TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs as a new pay-per-view event, which included a tables match, a ladder match, a match in which chairs were legal as weapons and, as the main event, a TLC match. TLC IX in the pitted Chris Jericho and The Big Show against D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) for the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship. This was the first TLC match to not include any member from the three original teams, though Jericho did have TLC experience.

A year later, at , the TLC match, for the first time, was a fatal four-way of the singles variety (III and IV had been fatal-four-way tag team bouts). The match pitted Edge, Kane, Rey Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio against each other for the World Heavyweight Championship. In the end, Edge won the title. This was also Edge&#x27;s seventh and last TLC match because of his retirement in early April the following year.

The next year at , CM Punk defended his WWE Championship in a first-ever triple threat TLC match against Alberto Del Rio and The Miz. Punk retained the championship, and this marked the second time that all three competitors had competed in a TLC match.

At , The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) fought Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan). This was the first TLC match to contain teams of three and was the first TLC match for everyone involved except Kane (competing in his third). It was the first TLC match decided by pinfall or submission and the first in which all the weapons would have to be retrieved from under the ring.

At , WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a TLC match for both the WWE and World Heavyweight titles. Orton won to become the first WWE World Heavyweight Champion. This was the first TLC match for Orton and the second for Cena.

At Extreme Rules (2014), a &quot;WeeLC match&quot; was contested between El Torito and Hornswoggle, the first TLC match to involve midget wrestlers and the second to be decided by pinfall or submission. The tables, ladders and chairs that the midget wrestlers used in this match were far smaller than the normal sized tables, ladders and chairs.

At Bray Wyatt defeated Dean Ambrose in the 17th TLC Match. This was also the third TLC match in which victory would be achieved by pinfall or submission.

At , Sheamus retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns in the 18th TLC Match.

At , AJ Styles retained the WWE World Championship against Dean Ambrose in the 19th TLC Match.

 marked the 20th TLC Match. Originally scheduled to feature the reunited Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) against the team of The Miz, Braun Strowman, Kane and Cesaro and Sheamus, Reigns was removed from the match due to a legitimate illness. Kurt Angle replaced Reigns, making the match Angle&#x27;s first in WWE since 2006. This was the first handicap TLC Match and the fourth decided by pinfall or submission. Angle, Strowman, and Cesaro were competing in their first TLC match.

On the December 10, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship in a TLC match against Baron Corbin. A few days later, marked the first women&#x27;s TLC Match, as Becky Lynch lost the WWE SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship to Asuka in a match also involving Charlotte Flair. Also, Braun Strowman defeated Baron Corbin in a TLC Match, thereby earning a WWE Universal Championship match at the &quot;Royal Rumble&quot; and stripping Corbin of all authoritative power.

On the special on October 28, 2020, Io Shirai retained the NXT Women&#x27;s Championship against Candice LeRae in a renamed TLC match—a &quot;Tables, Ladders and Scares match&quot;—renamed to fit the social celebration of Halloween. This match used ladders painted black and orange, and tables painted asphalt black with body chalk outlines on them. This was the first time a TLC match was ever done on an NXT show.

In other promotions, the TLC match has quite the following, appealing to a niche market within professional wrestling. Predating the TLC matches, two &quot;Tables and Ladders matches&quot; took place. These were traditional matches won by pinfall or submission, not by climbing the ladder for the belts. However, the term &quot;TLC&quot; itself was trademarked by WWE, thus other promotions give different names to these types of matches despite having an identical setup. In more hardcore-style promotions, the chairs were often replaced, or were used alongside, chains. One example of a variation of the TLC match is the Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes match. This match is a TLC match with the addition of Singapore Canes. The first and only TLC match was at Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, New York, involving Steve Corino, Justin Credible, and The Sandman.

<text>Louise Jacqueline Sorel ( Cohen; born August 6, 1940) is an American actress. She is perhaps best known for her role as Vivian Alamain in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1992 to 2000, 2009 to 2011, 2017 to 2018, 2020, and 2023, Augusta Lockridge on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1984 to 1991, and Emily Tanner on &quot;Beacon Hill&quot; since 2014.

== Early life ==
Sorel was born Louise Jacqueline Cohen in Los Angeles, California. Her parents were Albert J. Cohen, a film producer, Jeanne ( Sorel), a concert pianist. Sorel is Jewish.

Sorel received theatrical training at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York. She briefly attended the Institut Français, where she studied French. She began performing on stage when she was 15 years old.

== Career ==
Sorel&#x27;s early career was on the stage; she spent several years on Broadway, playing roles in &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; and &quot;Man and Boy&quot;. She appeared in stage productions of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and &quot;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#x27;s Window&quot;.

Sorel&#x27;s first feature film appearance was in the film &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (1965). She appeared in &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot; (1971), &quot;B.S. I Love You&quot; (1971), &quot;Every Little Crook and Nanny&quot; (1972), &quot;The Return of Charlie Chan&quot; (1973), &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982), &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; (1982), &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot; (1984), and &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; (1984), among others. Sorel has made guest appearances on more than 50 prime-time programs and TV movies, including &quot;Star Trek&quot; (as &quot;Rayna&quot;, in the episode &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot;, which aired in 1969). She also portrayed Terry Waverly, the sister-in-law of Dr. Richard Kimble, in an episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; in 1965.
She made other guest appearances on such programs as &quot;Bonanza&quot; (as Marie in the episode &quot;The Strange One&quot;, 1965), &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Search&quot; (as Magda Reiner, in &quot;Live Men Tell Tales&quot;), &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, among others. She had a principal role on &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot;.

Her first daytime dramatic role was as eccentric, meddlesome Augusta Wainwright on the NBC daytime drama &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from July 1984 to August 1986, then from November 1988 to May 1989, returning the following October. She remained until October 1991.

In between stints, she also spent a year appearing as a strong-willed but decent District Attorney, Judith Russell Sanders, on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, from August 1986 through November 1987. She played the villainous Vivian Alamain on the NBC daytime serial, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from March 1992 until February 2000. Sorel&#x27;s performance as Alamain garnered her five Soap Opera Digest Awards as &quot;Outstanding Villainess&quot; in 1994, &quot;Outstanding Showstopper&quot; in 1997, and again in 1999 as &quot;Outstanding Scene Stealer&quot;.

In 2000, shortly after her dismissal from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Sorel briefly joined the cast of the &quot;Port Charles&quot; as fashion maven &quot;Donatella Stewart&quot; (a play on the names Donatella Versace and Martha Stewart). The role lasted for a month. In 2001, she had a brief role on another ABC soap opera, &quot;All My Children,&quot; as &quot;Judge Kay Campobello,&quot; who blackmailed Adam Chandler into sleeping with her. She made a brief appearance on &quot;Passions&quot; as cannery worker Dort in 2004. In December 2009, she was invited to reprise her villainous role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

In June 2011, Sorel was let go from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; along with many other actors to make room for the return of super couple John and Marlena and several other characters. In 2014, Sorel played Emily Tanner in the soap opera web series &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;.

On December 29, 2017, Sorel returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Vivian. However, she was briefly replaced by Robin Strasser. On December 30, 2019, it was announced that Sorel would once again return to the role in 2020.

In 2023, Sorel returned to her role as Vivian Alamain, in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

<text>The Lake Washington School District #414 or LWSD is a public school district in King County, Washington, in suburbs east of Seattle. Its headquarters is in Redmond. it is the second-largest school district in Washington. It serves the region to the east of Lake Washington, one of the wealthiest in the Puget Sound area, though some parts of the area are well under the poverty line.

In October 2021, the district had a student enrollment of 30,500.

==Boundary==
The district serves the vast majority of Redmond, almost all of Kirkland, the majority of Union Hill-Novelty Hill, north Sammamish, and parts of Bellevue, Cottage Lake, and Woodinville. The portion of Kenmore in the district is in the Saint Edward State Park.

==History==
The district was formed in 1944 by combining three smaller districts: 
* Redmond School District #208
* Kirkland School District #224
* Juanita School District #21

In 1944 the new district had seven schools; as of 2022, it has 56.

In August 2012, LWSD moved the freshman class into its four high schools, and converted the junior highs to middle schools (grades 6–8).

==High schools==

===Traditional high schools ===
Formerly operated as senior high schools (grades 10–12), the four high schools added the freshman class in August 2012. All compete in the Kingco conference in Class 4A.

=== Choice High Schools ===
*The Cambridge Program is part of Juanita High School. The students in this program are students of Juanita High School, but are part of a different program.

===Other high schools===
*Lake Washington Technical Academy

==Middle schools==
All junior high schools (grades 7–9) became middle schools (grades 6–8) in August 2012.
*

==Elementary schools==
As of June 2020, there are 33 elementary schools in LWSD.

<doc id="697571" wikidata="Q284767" url="?curid=697571" title="De Havilland Venom">
<text>The de Havilland DH 112 Venom is a British post-war single-engined jet aircraft developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. Much of its design was derived from the de Havilland Vampire, the firm&#x27;s first jet-powered combat aircraft; it was initially referred to as the &quot;Vampire FB 8&quot; prior to the adoption of the Venom name.

The Venom was developed during the late 1940s to fulfil Air Ministry Specification F.15/49, under which the aircraft was intended to be operated as an interim solution, lying between the first generation of British jet fighters – straight-wing aircraft powered by centrifugal flow engines such as the Gloster Meteor and the Vampire – and later swept wing, axial flow-engined combat aircraft, such as the Hawker Hunter and de Havilland Sea Vixen. In comparison with the Vampire, it had a thinner wing and a more powerful de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine, making the aircraft more suitable for high altitude flight. Both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy took interest in the type; in order to suit the needs of the latter, a specialised derivative, the Sea Venom, was produced; it was a navalised model of the aircraft that was suitable for carrier operations. A dedicated model for aerial reconnaissance was also procured by the Swiss Air Force. On 2 September 1949, the first Venom prototype, &quot;VV612&quot;, performed its maiden flight.

The Venom entered service with the RAF in 1952, where it was operated as both a single-seat fighter-bomber and two-seat night fighter. Despite the type&#x27;s relatively short service life with the RAF, British Venoms flew on operations on several occasions, including the Suez Crisis, the Malayan Emergency, and the Aden Emergency. It was withdrawn from front line operations by the service in 1962 following the introduction of more capable aircraft. The Venom had also proved to be popular on the export market, having been sold in substantial numbers to Iraq, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela. The Swiss Air Force was the final operator to use the type in an active military role, finally retiring their last examples during 1983. Large numbers of ex-military Venoms have since been acquired by private entities and several have continued to fly, performing displays at various air shows, while many examples have been preserved in static display conditions in museums and as gate guardians.

==Development==
===Origins===
During 1948, the British aircraft manufacturer de Havilland proposed a development of the Vampire, furnished with a thinner wing and a more powerful engine, to serve as a high altitude fighter, designated as the &#x27;Vampire FB 8&#x27; (&quot;fighter bomber Mark 8&quot;). The design gradually shifted, with company designation DH 112, in order to fulfill Air Ministry requirement OR.277, defined in Specification F.15/49, which sought a fast, manoeuvrable and capable fighter-bomber to replace the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF) existing Vampires in that capacity. From the onset, the envisioned role had been intended as an interim fighter-bomber, while the development of aircraft capable of even greater performance had already been anticipated by the service.

Although generally similar in appearance to the preceding Vampire, sharing the distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure, the Venom was a completely new design. As originally designed, it was powered by the de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine, which was capable of generating 4,850lb of thrust, considerably more powerful than the earlier de Havilland Goblin that had been used on the Vampire. The Venom adopted a wing designed with a leading edge sweepback of 17.6 degrees, a minimised thickness/chord ratio reduced from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, while the trailing edge was straight; a pair of optionally-fitted wing tip tanks were also designed to be fitted without any negative impact on the aircraft&#x27;s overall combat manoeuvring capability.

A single Vampire F 1 had flown with the new Ghost engine in 1947. On 2 September 1949, the first Venom prototype, &quot;VV612&quot;, performed its maiden flight at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, piloted by John Derry. In May 1950, following the end of company trials, the prototype was delivered to RAF Boscombe Down for official trials by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE). In the course of these trials, the aircraft proved capable of satisfactory performance, including the besting of some contemporary fighters during mock combat, while some minor faults were also uncovered. On 23 May 1950, the second prototype, &quot;VV613&quot;, officially joined the development programme; it was delivered to the A&amp;AEE for further trials on 3 April 1951.

The first six production Venom also participated in trials performed by both de Havilland and the A&amp;AEE. On 21 April 1952, the first delivery of a production-standard Venom, a single-seat fighter-bomber, was made to the Central Fighter Establishment, where it was used for a full service evaluation prior to the type being cleared for active service. During 1952, the initial production model entered operational service with the RAF as the &#x27;Venom FB 1&#x27;. A total of 375 of this initial model were constructed.

===Further development===

On 22 August 1950, an improved Venom, the &quot;NF.2&quot; night fighter, performed its first flight, piloted by John Derry. de Havilland had developed it from the single seat ground attack-oriented Venom to serve as a replacement for the Vampire NF 10. For this variant, the fuselage was redesigned to accommodate a two-man crew, (pilot and navigator/radar operator), seated in a side-by-side configuration, and an aircraft interception radar installed in the extended nose. During late 1953, the Venom NF.2 entered squadron service, after being delayed to resolve minor problems that had been discovered. Specifically, preliminary handling trials had revealed unsatisfactory performance in poor weather conditions.

The Venom NF.2 was modified after being involved in several accidents in which pilots had difficulty making night-time approaches. Changes included the adoption of jettisonable clear canopies and alterations to the flight control surfaces, and the altered aircraft were re-designated &quot;NF.2A&quot;s. The Venom NF.2 was soon followed by the &quot;NF 3&quot;, which was the ultimate night fighter variant of the Venom. It incorporated further improvements, including power-actuated ailerons and an improved air interception radar. In 1953, the Venom NF 3 performed its first flight; it entered operational service with the RAF during June 1955.
The final Venom model developed for the RAF was the single-seat &quot;FB.4&quot;, which first flew on 29 December 1953. It entered service in 1955 and 250 were built. The FB.4 was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 103 engine. It was the first Venom to be fitted with an ejector seat, as well as being furnished with redesigned tail surfaces and hydraulically powered ailerons. The new rudder design prevented excessive yaw and eliminated incidents of rudder locking at low speeds. The FB 4 variant was the first to be compatible with the underwing fuel tanks.

The majority of the type&#x27;s production was conducted by de Havilland themselves. Following the completion of an initial batch of 15 production Venoms, manufacturing was transferred from de Havilland&#x27;s Hatfield facility to their larger production plant at Hawarden Airport. On 26 July 1952, the first Hawarden-built Venom was delivered to the RAF. In addition, the construction effort was augmented by numbers of Venom FB.1, FB.4 and NF.51 aircraft that were produced by Fairey Aviation at Manchester (Ringway) Airport. At one point, the production of further Venoms at the Bristol Aeroplane Company&#x27;s Filton facility was considered but was ultimately not pursued. During the early 1950s, the prospects for Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione producing the type under license were explored; these did not materialise however.

On account of substantial demand for the type from the Swiss Air Force, a licensed production arrangement was established with a consortium of Swiss aviation manufacturers in 1953, who did produce large numbers of Venoms. In the early 1970s, Swiss Venoms were equipped with a new extended nose to add space for the addition of a ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, an Identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder and a SAAB BT-9K ballistic computer that was used in conjunction with ground attack ordnance.

==Design==
The de Havilland Venom was a jet-propelled combat aircraft, featuring a distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure. Originally developed as a ground-attack fighter, it served as an interceptor as well. It possessed a favourable rate of climb and other positive characteristics that lent itself well to combat operations, and represented a significant advance over the preceding Vampire. It was a sound ground attack aircraft, possessing good manoeuvrability, steadiness, endurance, handling, and a range of compatible stores. The Venom&#x27;s manoeuvrability even gave it an edge against many dogfighters of the era, although its limited top speed proved to be a weakness in this role. Early issues, such as a rear spar weakness and flash fires due to the ingestion of vented fuel by the engine air intakes under some conditions, were quickly identified and overcome.
The Venom FB 1 was armed with four nose-mounted 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk V autocannon and could carry either two 1,000 lb (approx 450 kg) bombs or eight RP-3 &quot;60 lb&quot; air-to-ground rocket projectiles – the heavier bombs being an improvement over the Vampire FB 5. For additional range, each of the wing tips could be fitted with a fuel tank, freeing up the underwing stores positions for other stores and munitions, these tanks could not be jettisoned during flight. When installed, the tip tanks also had the effect of improving the aircraft&#x27;s roll rate, which was lower than many of its contemporaries. Early production Venoms commonly suffered from weaknesses within the wing structure, leading to flight limitations and warning markings being applied to distinguish them from typical aircraft.

The Venom FB 1 was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 48 Mk.1 turbojet engine; later marks were equipped with increasingly powerful models. The engine was ignited using explosive cartridges, known as Coffman engine starters; at the time, many operators were not previously familiar with such means of start up. Early production models lacked ejection seats, which was subject to official criticism and in response, they were fitted in later production models. The airframe itself had a relatively short life in UK service as it had been designed as a short term interim aircraft pending development of what would become the Hawker Hunter but in Swiss service, where the type was subject to a lengthy service life, several strengthening modifications were performed to more than double its viable lifespan. It was known for its simplicity in construction and relative cost-effectiveness, which contributed to its popularity to export customers.

==Operational history==

In August 1952, No. 11 Squadron become the first overseas squadron to convert to the Venom in exchange for their existing Vampires inventory; No. 11 was responsible for conducting the type&#x27;s operational service trials for the service. Upon their introduction to service, none of the single-seat fighter-bomber Venoms were deployed to home-based squadrons; priority was given to overseas forces, such as the Second Tactical Air Force stationed in Germany as well as those stationed in hotter climates where the benefits of the more powerful engine were most felt, such as Cyprus, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

During September 1952, the Venom participated in its first NATO training operation, Exercise Mainbrace. In mid-1953, a second Venom wing, consisting of Nos. 14, 98 and 118 Squadrons, was formed at RAF Fassberg, Lower Saxony; a third wing, comprising Nos. 16, 94, and 145 Squadrons, was also formed at RAF Celle, Lower Saxony, during the following year. In this capacity, the Venom was only operated for a short time, those squadrons stationed at RAF Fassberg converted to the Hunter in 1955, while those at RAF Celle were disbanded in 1957.

Throughout the mid-1950s, Venoms were dispatched to the furthest corners of the Commonwealth, being typically used to replace the Vampire in the fighter-bomber role. In August 1955, a flight of four Venoms conducted a 10,000 flight from RAF Habbaniya, Iraq to Wingfield Aerodrome, South Africa and back; while on the return leg of this journey, a speed record was set on the Cape Town-Pretoria route, covering the 807-mile distance in one hour and 23 minutes.

On 6 May 1953, the first of the Venom night fighters was delivered to the RAF. From 1955 onwards, an improved model of the night fighter, the Venom NF.3, was introduced to squadron service. However, the night fighter Venom had only a relatively brief career with the RAF, having been procured to serve as an interim solution while more capable designs were developed. Accordingly, in 1957, the RAF&#x27;s night fighter Venoms began to be withdrawn in favour of the newly introduced Gloster Javelin twin-engined all-weather fighter. In the night fighter role, the Venom was also adopted by export customers; the Swedish Air Force adopted the type as their principal night fighter in 1955 and operated three squadrons in this capacity.

RAF Venoms saw action during the Malayan Emergency, which took place between 1948 and 1960, although these aircraft did not commence operations until the mid-1950s with Nos. 45 and 60 Squadrons. While there, the Venom supported counterinsurgency operations against Communist guerrillas as part of Operation Firedog, the codename for RAF operations in Malaya. By 15 November 1957, the day on which the Venom was withdrawn from combat in the theatre, the type had conducted more than 300 strikes against guerillas. Several Venoms were lent to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for use during the same conflict, being operated by No. 14 Squadron RNZAF.
The Venom also saw combat service during the Suez Crisis during late 1956. The type was operated by Nos. 6, 8 and 249 Squadrons, flying from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. The Anglo-French invasion, codenamed Operation Musketeer, took place in response to the nationalisation of the Suez Canal by Egypt&#x27;s leader, General Nasser. The air war began on 31 October 1956. The Venoms attacked a variety of military installations on the ground; only a single RAF Venom was lost throughout the crisis.

From 1956 onwards, Middle Eastern-based RAF squadrons progressively received the improved Venom FB 4. Starting in 1956, RAF Venoms were deployed during the Aden Emergency, where they were used in support of counterinsurgency operations against terrorists and rebel tribesmen in Aden and Oman. In 1957, British RAF Venoms participated heavily during Jebel Akhdar War in Oman to expand the territory of the Sultanate, which was a &quot;de facto&quot; British colony, in order to gain access to oil wells in the interior parts of Oman. The RAF conducted 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958; insurgents were the primary targets, resulting various mountain top villages, water channels, and crops being struck in a conflict that remained relatively low profile internationally. As the conflict progressed, squadrons equipped with the Venom were reequipped, mainly by the English Electric Canberra; in 1960, the final squadron in the region that used the type was reequipped with the Hunter.

Outside of the RAF, the Swiss Air Force were the most prolific user of the Venom. In addition to the domestic production of 136 ground attack-orientated models and its Ghost engine to power them, Switzerland also produced a dedicated aerial reconnaissance variant of the aircraft, which were outfitted with specially modified underwing fuel tanks that had automated cameras installed in the forward section. Swiss Venoms were also subject to multiple improvement and upgrade programmes, including life extension modifications, the addition of UHF radio sets, and an improved license-built bombsight.

In 1962, all of the remaining Venoms in RAF service were withdrawn from first-line duties. The very last Venoms to leave active service were those aircraft in service with the Swiss Air Force, the last of which being retired from combat duties during the latter part of 1983.

==Aircraft on display==
The Venom has been preserved in significant numbers, mainly due to its longevity with the Swiss Air Force. In the UK, a number of Sea Venoms have been preserved, along with examples of the NF 3 and Swiss-built FB.50 and 54. In Sweden, two examples of the NF.51 are preserved. There are many survivors in Switzerland, and other Swiss aircraft are scattered throughout Europe. One such aircraft is preserved in the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim, although in the colours of the Iraqi Air Force. In Australia, a number of Sea Venom FAW.53s have also survived. Venezuela has the only complete surviving British-built single-seat Venom.

The Polish Aviation Museum (PAL) has a British-built Sea Venom, which was used for experiments at de Havilland and the A&amp;AEE and then was transferred to the Imperial War Museum, which sold it to the PAL in 2013.

Although the Venom was, for its era, a popular and affordable warbird, currently only one example of the type is airworthy, J-1630/ZK-VNM in New Zealand. However, J-1643/HB-RVY in Switzerland is reportedly undergoing work to return it to airworthy status.

<text>The Be File System (BFS) is the native file system for the BeOS. In the Linux kernel, it is referred to as &quot;BeFS&quot; to avoid confusion with Boot File System.

BFS was developed by Dominic Giampaolo and Cyril Meurillon over a ten-month period, starting in September 1996, to provide BeOS with a modern 64-bit-capable journaling file system. It is case-sensitive and capable of being used on floppy disks, hard disks and read-only media such as CD-ROMs. However, its use on small removable media is not advised, as the file-system headers consume from 600 KB to 2 MB, rendering floppy disks virtually useless.

Like its predecessor, OFS (Old Be File System, written by Benoit Schillings - formerly BFS), it includes support for extended file attributes (metadata), with indexing and querying characteristics to provide functionality similar to that of a relational database.

Whilst intended as a 64-bit-capable file system, the size of some on-disk structures mean that the practical size limit is approximately 2 exabytes. Similarly the extent-based file allocation reduces the maximum practical file size to approximately 260 gigabytes at best and as little as a few blocks in a pathological worst case, depending on the degree of fragmentation.

Its design process, application programming interface, and internal workings are, for the most part, documented in the book &quot;Practical File System Design with the Be File System&quot;.

==Implementations==
In addition to the original 1996 BFS used in BeOS, there are several implementations for Linux. In early 1999, Makoto Kato developed a Be File System driver for Linux; however, the driver never reached a completely stable state, so in 2001 Will Dyson developed his own version of the Linux BFS driver.

In 2002, Axel Dörfler and a few other developers created and released a reimplemented BFS called OpenBFS for Haiku (OpenBeOS back then). In January 2004, Robert Szeleney announced that he had developed a fork of this OpenBFS file system for use in his SkyOS operating system. The regular OpenBFS implementation was also ported to Syllable, with which it has been included since version 0.6.5.

<doc id="697578" wikidata="Q3002584" url="?curid=697578" title="Cricket Australia">
<text>Cricket Australia (CA) is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in Australia. It was originally formed in 1905 as the &#x27;Australian Board of Control for International Cricket&#x27;. It is incorporated as an Australian Public Company, limited by guarantee.

Cricket Australia operates all of the Australian national representative cricket sides, including the Men&#x27;s, Women&#x27;s and Youth, Australia A sides, along with various other national teams (such as Indigenous, disability or over-age teams) in conjunction with the relevant organisations. CA is also responsible for organising and hosting Test matches, one day internationals and T20 internationals in association with other nations, and scheduling home international fixtures.

==Background==
Cricket Australia is an administrative organisation responsible for cricket in Australia. Cricket Australia has six member organisations that represent each of the Australian states. These organisations are:

* New South Wales – Cricket NSW
* Queensland – Queensland Cricket
* South Australia – South Australian Cricket Association
* Tasmania – Cricket Tasmania
* Victoria – Cricket Victoria
* Western Australia – Western Australian Cricket

Cricket ACT and Northern Territory Cricket are non-member associations, although the ACT participates in Cricket Australia tournaments such as the Women&#x27;s National Cricket League and the Futures League, and previously briefly also competed in the domestic limited-overs competition.

Cricket Australia is governed by nine independent directors. The chief executive officer reports to the board of directors.

Each state cricket association that are members of Cricket Australia also selects a representative side to participate in Australia&#x27;s various major domestic cricket tournaments every season.

==Domestic teams==
Cricket Australia also maintains a healthy but independent association with the Australian Cricketers&#x27; Association to provide proper player&#x27;s rights, welfare requirements and pay agreements.

==History==
The first centralised authority for the administration of cricket in Australia was established in 1892 when representatives from the state associations of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria came together to establish the Australasian Cricket Council. However the Australasian Cricket Council was disbanded in 1898, and what is now known as Cricket Australia was established in 1905 as the &quot;Australian Board of Control for International Cricket&quot;. Before its establishment, tours by Australian teams to England were organised and funded by private groups or by the players themselves. Similarly, invitations to English teams were made by private promoters or by individual clubs, such as the Melbourne Cricket Club. The Australasian Cricket Council&#x27;s one lasting action was to establish the Sheffield Shield, the first-class cricket competition between the Australian colonies.

These early tours were lucrative for the players and promoters and cricket administrators looked to find ways to channel some of this money to the destitute clubs, through the state associations. Formal discussions began in January 1905 in Sydney for the formation of a body to take control of tours from the players. A draft constitution was discussed by members of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australian and Queensland associations. The first meeting of the new board was held at Wesley College in Melbourne on 6 May 1905.

The foundation members were the New South Wales Cricket Association and the Victorian Cricket Association. South Australia&#x27;s delegates refused to join the Board because the Board structure denied the players any representation. The Queensland Cricket Association was represented as an observer only.

Queensland did decide to formally join the association with one delegate member the following year, and the constitution was amended in 1906, so that New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria would each have three permanent representatives, and Queensland one representative. In 1907 Tasmania was permitted to send a single representative, and Western Australia did likewise in 1913. Changes to this structure were made in 1914 and 1974 respectively when Queensland and Western Australia formally increased their representation to two each.

In 2001, Cricket Australia established the National Indigenous Cricket Advisory Committee (NICAC), which in 2002 established a strategic plan, &quot;Two Cultures: Australia&#x27;s New Cricket Tradition&quot;. Ngadjuri man Vince Copley was the inaugural co-chair of the committee.

===Name changes===
Cricket Australia has operated under three different names since its foundation. They are:

*Australian Board of Control for International Cricket (ABC) (1905–1973)
*Australian Cricket Board (ACB) (1973–2003)
*Cricket Australia (CA) (2003–present)

==Finances==
The organisation&#x27;s revenue was A$380.9 million in the financial year ended 30 June 2015, with a net surplus of $99 million largely attributed to the success of co-hosting the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.

==Competitions==
As well as responsibility for Australian international sides, Cricket Australia organises interstate cricket in Australia, including the premier competitions in each of the major forms of the game. These are the Sheffield Shield in first-class cricket (men&#x27;s competition only), the One-Day Cup (men) and the Women&#x27;s National Cricket League, which are the domestic one-day competitions, and the KFC Big Bash League and the Weber Women&#x27;s Big Bash League, which are the domestic Twenty20 competitions (contested by franchises not state representative teams).

Cricket Australia&#x27;s current and former competitions:

* Sheffield Shield (first-class, various forms, 1892/93-present)
* One-Day Cup (limited-overs, various forms, 1969/70-present)
* KFC Twenty20 Big Bash (T20, 2005/06-2010/11, replaced by KFC BBL)
* KFC Big Bash League (T20, 2011/12-present)
* Toyota Second XI (red-ball, various forms, 1999/2000-2008/09, 2019/20-present, 2009/10-2018/19 as Futures League)
* Australian Women&#x27;s Cricket Championships (first-class and limited-overs, various forms, 1930/31-1995/96, replaced by WNCL)
* Women&#x27;s National Cricket League (limited-overs, various forms, 1996/97-present)
* Australian Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Cup (T20, various forms, 2007-2014/15, replaced by WBBL)
* Weber Women&#x27;s Big Bash League (T20, 2015/16-present, 2015/16-2020/21 as rebel WBBL)

Cricket Australia also runs (among others) the Under 19 and Under 17 Male Championships, the Under 18 and Under 15 Female National Championships, the National Indigenous Cricket Championships and the National Cricket Inclusion Championships.

==Honours==
Cricket Australia also provides awards for various categories of players, including:

<doc id="697584" wikidata="Q204602" url="?curid=697584" title="Zinc pyrithione">
<text>Zinc pyrithione (or pyrithione zinc) is a coordination complex of zinc. It has fungistatic (inhibiting the division of fungal cells) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting bacterial cell division) properties and is used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff.

== Structure of the compound ==
The pyrithione ligands, which are formally monoanions, are chelated to Zn2+ via oxygen and sulfur centers. In the crystalline state, zinc pyrithione exists as a centrosymmetric dimer (see figure), where each zinc is bonded to two sulfur and three oxygen centers. In solution, however, the dimers dissociate via scission of one Zn-O bond.

This compound was first described in the 1930s.

Pyrithione is the conjugate base derived from 2-mercaptopyridine-&quot;N&quot;-oxide (CAS# 1121-31-9), a derivative of pyridine-&quot;N&quot;-oxide.

== Uses ==

=== Medicine ===
Zinc pyrithione can be used to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. It also has antibacterial properties and is effective against many pathogens from the &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; genera. Its other medical applications include treatments of psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, fungus, athletes foot, dry skin, atopic dermatitis, tinea versicolor, and vitiligo.

=== Paint ===
Because of its low solubility in water (8 ppm at neutral pH), zinc pyrithione is suitable for use in outdoor paints and other products that protect against mildew and algae. It is an algaecide. It is chemically incompatible with paints relying on metal carboxylate curing agents. When it is used in latex paints with water containing much iron, a sequestering agent that preferentially binds the iron ions is needed. It is decomposed by ultraviolet light slowly, providing years of protection in direct sunlight.

=== Sponges ===
Zinc pyrithione is an antibacterial treatment for household sponges, as used by the 3M Corporation.

=== Clothing ===
A process to apply zinc pyrithione to cotton with washable results was patented in the United States in 1984. Zinc pyrithione is used to prevent microbe growth in polyester. Textiles with applied zinc pyrithione protect against odor-causing microorganisms. Export of antimicrobial textiles reached US$497.4 million in 2015.

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Antibacterial effect ===
Zinc pyrithione is known to exhibit antibacterial activity by disrupting cell membrane integrity and essential metabolic functions in bacteria. 

=== Antifungal effect ===
Its antifungal effect is thought to derive from its ability to disrupt membrane transport by blocking the proton pump that energizes the transport mechanism. A study from 2011 showed that antifungal effects of Zinc pyrithione work by copper toxicity mechanism that targets critical iron–sulphur proteins.

== Health effects ==
Zinc pyrithione is approved for over-the-counter topical use in the United States as a treatment for dandruff and is the active ingredient in several anti-dandruff shampoos and body wash gels. In its industrial forms and strengths, it may be harmful by contact or ingestion. Zinc pyrithione can in the laboratory setting trigger a variety of responses, such as DNA damage in skin cells.

== Legal status ==

=== European Union ===
Use of zinc pyrithione is prohibited within cosmetic products in the European Union since December 2021. The substance was considered safe for use in rinse-off and leave-in products of different tested concentrations, but due to potential environmental toxicity consideration of the use of zinc pyrithione was made against potential alternative substance ingredients. Due to no industry submission to the regulators supporting the continued use of zinc pyrithione and/or an absence of indications that there were no suitable alternatives to the substance: the use of zinc pyrithione became automatically prohibited within cosmetic products as an intended ingredient. This was as a consequence of zinc pyrithione addition to the Cosmetic Product Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 Annex II list.

=== United States ===
Zinc pyrithione concentration of up to 2% is allowed for products when they are formulated to be applied and then washed off after brief exposure. Alternatively, up to 0.25 percent when formulated to be left on the skin or scalp 

== Environmental concerns ==
A large Swedish study shows that it is broken down in wastewater plants and does not release into waterways. A Danish study shows that it biodegrades quickly, but that a risk of continuous leaching from boat paint may cause environmental toxicity.

<text>John McAllister Schofield (; September 29, 1831 – March 4, 1906) was an American soldier who held major commands during the American Civil War. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of War (1868–1869) under President Andrew Johnson and later served as Commanding General of the United States Army (1888–1895).

==Early life==
John McAllister Schofield was born September 29, 1831, in Gerry, New York, the son of the Reverend James Schofield and his first wife, the former Caroline (McAllister) Schofield. His father, a Baptist minister in Sinclairville became a domestic missionary and moved his family (which then included six children and would include 10 who survived infancy) to Bristol, Illinois. When John was 12, they finally settled in Freeport, Illinois, where Rev. Schofield became the town&#x27;s first Baptist minister in 1845, and where he was ultimately buried in 1888.

During the American Revolutionary War, his family consisted of both Patriots and Loyalists. His grandfather at the time was considered below the age to fight during the Revolution. Though, after settling in New York, he fought in the New York Militia during the War of 1812. His earliest ancestor who arrived in America was Richard Schofield, who came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England in 1635.

As a young man John Schofield was educated in the public schools, helped his family farm and build their home, and then surveyed land in northern Wisconsin before spending a year teaching school in Oneco, Illinois, not far from Freeport. Then U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Turner secured John Schofield an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He sold land for travel expenses and reported on June 1, 1849. In his final year at the Academy, while a teaching assistant in the mathematics section, cadet Schofield was accused of allowing others in his classroom to make offensive jokes and drawings on the blackboard. He was dismissed from West Point, but after meeting with Illinois&#x27; U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, appealed the decision to the Secretary of War, who referred the matter back to a Board of Inquiry at the Academy. A majority of the review board voted to rescind the expulsion, but one of the two officers who voted to sustain it, cavalry and artillery instructor Lt. George H. Thomas, later became a commander of Schofield during the Civil War. Although Schofield&#x27;s eventual memoirs did not mention Thomas on the review board, his persistent criticism of Thomas&#x27;s generalship after the war may reflect this incident. Schofield graduated in 1853, ranking seventh in his class, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.

Schofield served for two years in the artillery. His first post was at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, which he later noted involved the same guns that were used to bombard Fort Sumter in 1861. He then served at various places in Florida during the armed truce with the Seminole Nation, but contracted fevers and dysentery and was ultimately evacuated (with the assistance of future Confederate General A. P. Hill) and recovered at Culpeper, Virginia.

Upon regaining his health, First Lieutenant Schofield returned to West Point as assistant professor of natural and experimental philosophy from 1855 to 1860. His career seemed stalled, so he took leave (1860–1861), to work as professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis. Several of his brothers had settled in St. Louis, following the lead of his eldest brother Rev. James Van Pelt Schofield (1825–1898).

==Civil War==

When the Civil War broke out, Schofield helped assure Missouri did not join the Confederacy. He became a major in the 1st Missouri Infantry Regiment and served as chief of staff to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon until Lyon&#x27;s death during the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek (Missouri) in August 1861. Schofield acted with &quot;conspicuous gallantry&quot; during the battle, and decades later received the Medal of Honor for that action.

Schofield was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on November 21, 1861. From 1861 to 1863 he held various commands in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. He commanded the District of St Louis from that date to 10 April 1862, the Military District of Missouri from 5 June to 24 September 1862, and the District of Southwest Missouri to 10 November 1862. He led the Army of the Frontier from 12 October 1862 to 30 May 1863. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on November 29, 1862, at the age of 31, making him one of the youngest major generals in the Civil War.

On 30 September 1862, a Federal brigade suffered a defeat at the First Battle of Newtonia in southwest Missouri. Both James G. Blunt and Schofield rushed to Newtonia, Missouri, with reinforcements and sent the Confederate force fleeing south into Arkansas. The department commander Samuel Ryan Curtis created the Army of the Frontier with Schofield in command. Blunt led the 1st Division, James Totten the 2nd Division, and Francis J. Herron the 3rd Division. The army numbered 20,000 men, but probably 14,000 were fit for duty. Schofield&#x27;s army crossed into northwest Arkansas on 17 October. Blunt&#x27;s division soon moved west into Indian Territory where it won the Battle of Old Fort Wayne on 22 October. Meanwhile, Schofield with the 2nd and 3rd Divisions occupied Huntsville, Arkansas. Schofield&#x27;s troops clashed with forces led by Thomas C. Hindman, and the Confederates retreated south on 29 October. On 4 November, with the approval of Curtis, Schofield&#x27;s two divisions withdrew northeast to Springfield, Missouri while Blunt&#x27;s division remained in northwest Arkansas.

He was eventually relieved of duty in the West, at his own request, due to altercations with his superior Samuel R. Curtis.

From 17 April to 10 May 1863, Schofield led the 3rd Division in the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland. He returned to Missouri as commander of the Department of Missouri from 24 May 1863 to 30 January 1864. His command in Missouri was marred by controversy after a massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, when Schofield refused to allow a posse to pursue the combatants into Missouri. Pro-Union Missourians sent a delegation to Washington, D.C., in October to plead with President Lincoln to dismiss Schofield for sympathizing with pro-Confederate Bushwhacker para-military marauders who were attacking loyal Union citizens. Lincoln backed Schofield&#x27;s position, attributed the carnage to wartime conditions rather than the commander&#x27;s inadequacy, and instructed Schofield to respect civil liberties unless assemblies or newspapers were working palpable harm to the military.

In 1864, as commander of the Army of the Ohio, Schofield participated in the Atlanta Campaign under Major General William T. Sherman. Sherman placed him in command of a major operation to break the rail lines in late July 1864. Schofield became embroiled in another controversy with the commander of the US XIV Corps (Volunteer), Major General John Palmer, who resigned rather than serve under Schofield, whom he considered to be of lower rank, but whom Gen. Sherman backed, at Utoy Creek (becoming the only resignation during a major operation in U.S. history, although Palmer was ultimately reassigned to Kentucky and helped maintain federal control over that border state). Schofield with his XXIII Corps and the XIV Corps then spent the month in front of Atlanta and East Point with lackluster results. Sherman resorted to a flanking movement to defeat the Confederates under Hood. Schofield was sent to cut off Hardee&#x27;s retreat at Jonesboro but failed to move. He became embroiled in a further controversy, when placed under General Stanley commanding the US IV Corps, on August 30, 1864.
Sherman, after the fall of Atlanta, took the majority of his forces on a March to the Sea through Georgia. Schofield&#x27;s Army of the Ohio was detached to join Major General George H. Thomas in Tennessee. When Confederate General John Bell Hood invaded Tennessee and nearly cut off Schofield&#x27;s command at Spring Hill, Hood&#x27;s rash assault to regain momentum at the subsequent Battle of Franklin resulted in a significant defeat. On December 15–16, Schofield took part in Thomas&#x27;s crowning victory at the Battle of Nashville where Hood&#x27;s Army of Tennessee was decisively defeated, and effectively destroyed as a fighting force for the remainder of the war. However, during the buildup towards the battle Schofield intrigued against Thomas, feeding Grant false information, in order to try to succeed his senior in command. For his services at Franklin he was awarded the rank of brigadier general in the regular army on November 30, 1864, and the brevet rank of major general on March 13, 1865.

Ordered to operate with Sherman in North Carolina, Schofield moved his corps by rail and sea to Fort Fisher, North Carolina, in 17 days, occupied Wilmington on February 22, 1865, fought the action at Kinston on March 10, and on March 23, joined Sherman at Goldsboro.

==Reconstruction==
After the war, President Andrew Johnson sent Schofield on a special diplomatic mission to France, urging withdrawal of French troops in Mexico. General Schofield also joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society composed of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants. After retiring from active duty, Schofield served as the Order&#x27;s commander-in-chief (from 1899 to 1903).

During Reconstruction, President Johnson appointed Schofield to serve as military governor of Virginia and of the First Military District. Thus, he oversaw the elections (in which blacks and whites voted) which resulted in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868. When Radicals took over that convention and proposed to disenfranchise former Confederates Schofield voiced concerns about corruption to Congress as well as his commander, General Ulysses Grant. Schofield&#x27;s position was of high importance and sensitivity, due to the region&#x27;s proximity to Washington as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s incarceration in Norfolk and awaiting trial under Judge John Curtiss Underwood, who chaired the Constitutional Convention and had close links with Congressional Republicans. After President Johnson forced Edwin M. Stanton, a Radical Republican who had served as Secretary of War since 1862, to resign, Schofield served as Secretary of War from June 1868 to March 1869.

==Postwar career==

Schofield was promoted to major general in the Regular Army on March 4, 1869, the same day General Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in as president of the United States. Schofield then served for a year as head of the Department of Missouri, the Army&#x27;s second largest military department.

Following General George Thomas&#x27; death, Schofield succeeded him in commanding the Military Division of the Pacific, the country&#x27;s largest.

In 1873, Schofield was given a secret task by Secretary of War William Belknap to investigate the strategic potential of a United States presence in the Hawaiian Islands. Schofield&#x27;s report recommended that the United States establish a naval port at Pearl Harbor.

Starting in 1876 until 1881, Schofield became superintendent of the United States Military Academy. A major focus was reducing hazing and increasing professionalism within the academy. In 1878, Schofield drew the ire of Radical Republicans when President Rutherford B. Hayes asked him to reopen the case of Major General Fitz John Porter, who had been convicted by a court-martial for cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Schofield&#x27;s review board used new evidence from Confederate generals who had participated in the battle, and then found that Porter had been wrongly convicted and that his actions might have saved the entire Union army from complete defeat caused by the ineptitude of Maj. Gens. John Pope and Irvin McDowell.

On April 5, 1880, an African American cadet at West Point, Johnson Chesnut Whittaker, was found bruised and beaten in his cot. He claimed that he had been attacked by fellow cadets, but the administration claimed he had fabricated his story to win sympathy. Whittaker was court-martialed and expelled for allegedly faking an assault on himself staged by his fellow cadets. A Congressional investigation into the incident resulted in Schofield&#x27;s removal from his post as superintendent in 1881.

Schofield then served in the Department of the Gulf (1881–82), the Military Division of the Pacific (1882–83), the Military Division of the Missouri (1883–86), and the Military Division of the Atlantic (1886–88). He also went to France to witness military maneuvers there. Gen. Schofield was also the first President of the Army and Navy Club (founded 1885, incorporated 1891).

Upon the death of General Philip Sheridan in 1888, General Schofield, by virtue of his seniority in rank, became the commanding general of the United States Army. He supported military professionalism, including subordination to the civilian Secretary of War. Schofield also supported adoption of lineal promotions and initiated performance reviews which limited political patronage considerations from the promotion process. Writing from South Dakota, General Schofield seconded a report of General Thomas H. Ruger which urged the federal government to honor treaty obligations with Native Americans.

General Schofield received the Medal of Honor on July 2, 1892, for his actions at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek in 1861. During the unrest of the Pullman Strike, Schofield worked with President Cleveland in a discreet advisory role. On February 5, 1895, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Lieutenant General Schofield retired on September 29, 1895, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64.

However, he remained active in government affairs, supporting Elihu Root, testifying before congressional committees in support of the Army Reorganization Act of 1901 and the Dick Act of 1903 which established the U.S. National Guard.

==Personal life==
John Schofield married Harriet Whitehorn Bartlett, daughter of W.F.C. Bartlett (Chairman of West Point&#x27;s Department of Philosophy) and they had two daughters and four sons. Two sons, John (1858–1868) and Henry (1862–1863), died before reaching adulthood. William Bartlett Schofield (1860–1906) survived to adulthood and began a U.S. Army career, rising to Major, as did Richmond McAlister Schofield (1867–1941). After Harriet died in 1888, she was buried with her father and son John in the United States Military Academy Post cemetery.

At age 60, in Keokuk, Iowa in June 1891, Schofield remarried, to 27-year-old Georgia Wells Kilbourne, with whom he had a daughter, Georgiana. Georgia Wells Kilbourne was a native of Keokuk, Iowa. She was the daughter of George Kilbourne, and was named Georgia for her father. She attended school in New York, and afterwards studied abroad. Her mother, Mrs. Kilbourne, and her younger sister, Miss Emma Kilbourne, spent a part of the year at her Washington home. Emma Kilbourne devoted much of her time to reading and study.

During his military career, perhaps because of his reformer image, Schofield was dogged by accusations of favoritism toward family members. His brother George Wheeler Schofield (1833–1882) also became a brevet Brigadier General of U.S. Volunteers during the American Civil War, originally volunteering with the 1st Missouri Volunteer Infantry in November 1861 and promoted to Captain in the 1st Missouri Light Artillery after the Siege of Vicksburg, and rising to command the 2nd Regiment Missouri Volunteer Light artillery and ultimately being commissioned as a Major in the Regular Army after the Civil War and serving in the 10th Cavalry and later the 6th Cavalry on the Western Frontier, and for whom the .45 caliber Smith and Wesson Schofield revolver was named. Another brother Charles Brewster Schofield (1849–1901) graduated from West Point in 1870. C.B. Schofield later served as his Gen. J.M. Schofield&#x27;s aide during the Indian Wars from 1878 to 1885. After rising to the rank of Captain during the Spanish–American War, he died of a heart attack in Matanzas, Cuba in 1901 and was also buried at Arlington National Cemetery. While Gen. John Schofield was in charge of Military District No. 1 in Virginia, his brother Elisha McAllister Schofield (1835–1870) was the assessor for the City of Richmond, Virginia and was among many killed on April 26, 1870, as a result of the infamous collapse of the balcony at the State Capitol during a session of the Virginia Court of Appeals. His son in law, Brig. Gen. Avery Delano Andrews and his wife Mary Campbell Schofield Andrews are also buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Death and legacy==
Before his death, Schofield became the last surviving member of Andrew Johnson&#x27;s cabinet. His memoirs, &quot;Forty-six Years in the Army&quot;, were published in 1897. General Schofield became an honorary companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

General Schofield died at St. Augustine, Florida on March 4, 1906. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Schofield Barracks, Hawaii are named in his honor.

Today, Schofield is also remembered for a lengthy quotation that all cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, The Citadel, Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, and the United States Air Force Academy are required to memorize. It is an excerpt from his graduation address to the class of 1879 at West Point:

==Medal of Honor citation==

Rank and organization:
:Major, 1st Missouri Infantry. Place and date: At Wilsons Creek, Mo., August 10, 1861. Entered service at: St. Louis, Mo. Born: September 29, 1831, Gerry, N.Y. Date of issue: July 2, 1892.
Citation:
:Was conspicuously gallant in leading a regiment in a successful charge versus the enemy.
The medal was recommended by Schofield himself when he was interim U.S. Secretary of War (1868–69). Historian Benson Bobrick is critical of this and notes the vagueness of the details in the citation.

General Schofield was posthumously entitled to the Civil War Campaign Medal and the Indian Campaign Medal. Both medals were created in 1907, a year after Schofield died.

<text>The de Havilland DH.112 Sea Venom is a British postwar carrier-capable jet aircraft developed from the de Havilland Venom. It served with the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm and with the Royal Australian Navy. The French Navy operated the Aquilon, developed from the Sea Venom FAW.20, built under licence by SNCASE (Sud-Est).

==Design and development==
The Sea Venom was the navalised version of the Venom NF.2 two-seat night fighter, and was used as an all-weather interceptor by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). The necessary modifications for use on the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers included folding wings, a tailhook (which retracted into a characteristic &quot;lip&quot; over the jetpipe) and strengthened, long-stroke undercarriage. The canopy was modified to allow ejection from underwater. The first prototype made its first flight in 1951, and began carrier trials that same year. A further two prototypes were built. The first production Sea Venom took the designation FAW.20 (Fighter, All-Weather). It was powered by a single de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine and its armament was the same as the RAF version. The next variant was the FAW.21, which included the modifications introduced in the Venom NF.2A and NF.3. Some of these modifications included the Ghost 104 engine, a clear-view canopy and American radar. The final Royal Navy variant was the FAW.22 powered by the Ghost 105 engine. A total of 39 of this type were built in 1957–58. Some were later fitted out with the de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile.

Seven FAW.21s were modified in 1958 for Electronic countermeasures (ECM) purposes, with the cannon replaced by the ECM equipment. These became the ECM.21. 831 Naval Air Squadron, the sole squadron to be equipped with it, was shore-based at RAF Watton from 1963 and disbanded in 1966. Converted FAW.22s were similarly known as the ECM.22.

A modernised Sea Venom project, the DH.116 with swept wings and upgraded radar was considered, but cancelled as the Royal Navy believed that any replacement needed two engines. The de Havilland Sea Vixen ultimately replaced the Sea Venom.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy service===
In 1956 Sea Venoms, alongside RAF Venoms, took part in the Suez War. They were from Nos. 809, 891, 892, 893, 894, 895 Naval Air Squadrons based on the light fleet carrier and fleet carrier . The Anglo-French invasion, codenamed Operation Musketeer, began on 31 October 1956 signalling the beginning of the Suez War. The Sea Venoms launched many sorties, bombing a variety of targets in Egypt in the process.

Sea Venoms also saw service during conflicts in the Middle East.

By 1959, the Sea Venom began to be replaced in Royal Navy service by the de Havilland Sea Vixen, an aircraft that also had the distinctive twin-boom tail. The Sea Venom would be withdrawn from frontline service soon afterwards. The type continued to fly with second line FAA units until the last were withdrawn in 1970.

===Service with other nations===
Thirty-nine Sea Venom FAW.53s saw service with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), replacing the Hawker Sea Fury. The Sea Venom entered service in 1956 and, during its service with the RAN, operated off the aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;. It was taken out of first-line service in 1967, replaced by the American McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk.

From 1957 to 1961, French Navy Aquilons took part in counter-insurgency operations in Algeria. They were withdrawn from service in 1965.

<text>Edward Hugh Hanlon (August 22, 1857 – April 14, 1937), also known as &quot;Foxy Ned&quot;, and sometimes referred to as &quot;the Father of Modern Baseball&quot;, was an American professional baseball player and manager whose career spanned from 1876 to 1914. He was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996 by the Veterans Committee.

Hanlon was a manager in Major League Baseball from 1889 to 1907, compiling a 1,313–1,164 (.530) record with five different clubs. He is best remembered as the manager of the Baltimore Orioles (1892–1898) and Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1905). In the seven seasons from 1894 to 1900, Hanlon compiled a 635–315 () record, and his teams won five National League pennants. During his years with the Orioles, Hanlon was also credited with inventing and perfecting the &quot;inside baseball&quot; strategy, including the &quot;hit and run&quot; play and the Baltimore chop. In 1899, he became the second manager in baseball history to win 100 games in a season, doing so after Brooklyn won 101 games to win the National League pennant. The following year, he won his final National League pennant with Brooklyn, his fifth in seven seasons.

Hanlon also played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a center fielder. He played in over 800 games as an outfielder for the Detroit Wolverines, remaining with the team during all eight years of its existence from 1881 to 1888. He compiled a career batting average of .260 and an on-base percentage of .325 with 930 runs scored and 1,317 hits. Although stolen base records are not available for the early portion of his playing career, Hanlon stole 329 bases (an average of 55 per year) in his last six years as a full-time player.

==Early life==
Hanlon was born in 1857 at Montville, Connecticut. His parents, Terrance and Mary Hanlon, were immigrants from Ireland. In 1870, Hanlon&#x27;s father worked as a railroad laborer while Ned, at age 13, along with his older brother James (age 14) and younger brother O&#x27;Brien (age 11) worked in a cotton mill to help support the family. By 1880, the family had moved a few miles south to New London, where Hanlon&#x27;s father, three brothers (James, Bryon and Terrance) and a step-sister (Clara Blake) were all working in a cotton mill. Ned was saved from life in the mill by his talent for baseball. The 1880 census recorded his occupation, in contrast to his other family members, as a professional ball player.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
Hanlon began his professional baseball career in 1876 at age 17 or 18 with the Providence, Rhode Island club. He next played for the Fall River, Massachusetts club in the New England League in 1877, the Rochester, New York club in the International Association in 1878, and the Albany, New York team in the National Association in 1879. He played third base at Albany, posted a .315 batting average and scored 44 runs in 47 games.

===Cleveland===
Hanlon made his major league debut on May 1, 1880, as a member of the Cleveland Blues of the National League. He appeared in 73 games for the Blues, 69 as an outfielder and four as a shortstop, and compiled a .246 batting average with 32 RBIs. On June 12, 1880, he made the final out of the first perfect game in major league history, a 1–0 victory by Lee Richmond of the Worcester Ruby Legs.

===Detroit===

Hanlon joined the newly formed Detroit Wolverines in 1881. He is one of only two players, along with Charlie Bennett, who played for the Wolverines during all eight years of the team&#x27;s existence. In his eight seasons with the Wolverines, Hanlon compiled a .261 batting average, which was boosted to a .318 on-base percentage by 271 bases on balls and six times hit by pitch. He hit over .300 only once in his career, compiling a .302 batting average (.372 on-base percentage) in 1885.

During his time with Detroit, Hanlon was considered to be an excellent base-runner. Although stolen base records are not available for the years before 1886, Hanlon stole 329 bases (an average of 55 per year) in his last six years as a full-time player. His base-running prowess is also evidenced by his scoring 623 runs on only 879 hits for the Wolverines. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; called him a &quot;wonderful base runner and a spark plug.&quot; In October 1885, &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;striking illustration of Ned Hanlon&#x27;s daring and speed that for two years Buck Ewing has never once succeeded in throwing him out at second on a steal. And Buck is one of the best throwers in the League.&quot;

Hanlon had excellent range in center field, leading the league in outfield putouts in 1882 and 1884 and ranking among the league leaders every year from 1882 to 1887. He also led the league in double plays turned from the outfield in 1882 (eight) and 1883 (six) and ranked among the leading outfielders in range factor five times from 1882 to 1887. Perhaps as a result of his extensive range, Hanlon was also regularly among the leaders in outfield errors and led the league with 35 errors in 1880, 38 in 1885 and 31 in 1891. In 1886, &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; wrote: &quot;Ned Hanlon never played a more brilliant fielding game than now. It is doubtful if any other fielder ever did, either.&quot; Decades later, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; opined that Hanlon was &quot;one of the greatest ground coverers the game ever had.&quot;

Hanlon became captain of the Wolverines in 1885, and during the 1886 and 1887 seasons, led teams that rank among the greatest in Detroit baseball history. After acquiring sluggers Sam Thompson, Dan Brouthers and Hardy Richardson, and with pitcher Lady Baldwin winning 42 games, the 1886 Wolverines compiled an 87–36 (.707) record, but finished games behind the Chicago White Stockings. The 1887 Wolverines won the pennant with a 79–45 record.

In 1888, the Wolverines finished in fifth place with a 68–63 record. The team folded in October 1888, and Hanlon was sold to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys.

===Spalding trip===
During the winter of 1888–89, Hanlon traveled to Hawaii, Australia, Ceylon, Arabia, Egypt, Europe, and the British Isles as part of Albert Spalding&#x27;s &quot;Around the World Baseball Tour&quot;. Baseball games were held between the Chicago White Stockings and a picked team called the &quot;All-Americans&quot;; Hanlon played center field for the &quot;All-Americans&quot;.

===Pittsburgh===

After returning from the Spalding tour, Hanlon joined the Pittsburgh Alleghenys and took over as a player-manager in the second half of the season. The Alleghenys had compiled a 35–53 record and were languishing near the basement of the National League before Hanlon took over as manager. In the last part of the season, Hanlon led the team to a 26–18 record. As a player, Hanlon compiled a .239 batting average (.326 on-base percentage), scored 81 runs, and stole 53 bases during the 1889 season.

In late 1889, Hanlon was one of the early supporters and organizers of the new Players&#x27; League. He served as player-manager for the Pittsburgh Burghers during the 1890 season. In Hanlon&#x27;s first full season as a manager, his team compiled a 60–68 record and finished in sixth place in the Players&#x27; League. Hanlon put in a solid performance as a player in 1890, posting a .278 batting average and a career-high .389 on-base percentage fueled by a career-high 80 bases on balls. He also led the Players&#x27; League with 291 outfield putouts, posted a 2.59 range factor (3rd highest among the league&#x27;s outfielders), and ranked fourth in the league with 65 stolen bases.

The Players&#x27; League folded after one season, though Hanlon was credited with working harder than anyone else to make the league a success. One account published in late 1890 stated: &quot;I want to say, gentlemen, that you can talk of the loyalty of a Ward, a Ewing, a Keefe and so on, but give me Ned Hanlon above everybody else. He stands to-day as the hero of the Players&#x27; League. He is the only ball player in that League who has held to the contract he signed. Not a penny has he received for his work this season, although he has played better ball than ever before.&quot;
Hanlon returned to the Alleghenys as player-manager in 1891. Prior the 1891 season, Hanlon was involved in an incident that led to the Pittsburgh team acquiring the name &quot;Pirates.&quot; After the collapse of the Players&#x27; League, Hanlon traveled to Pennsylvania&#x27;s Presque Isle Peninsula in the dead of winter to sign second baseman, Louis Bierbauer. Alfred Spink, the founder of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, wrote about the incident in 1910 for a journal called &quot;The Pirates Reader&quot;. According to Spink, Hanlon crossed the ice on the harbor during a snow storm, finally reached Bierbauer&#x27;s home and got him to sign a contract with the Alleghenys. The Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, objected to Bierbauer&#x27;s signing and stated that he should return to Philadelphia, since that was the team that employed him before his defection to the Players&#x27; League. An official for the American Association called Hanlon&#x27;s act in signing Bierbauer to be &quot;piratical.&quot; The Alleghenies contended that because &quot;the American Association did not reserve Bierbauer, he was a free agent&quot;. An arbitrator agreed, and soon players and fans alike were calling the team the &quot;Pittsburgh Pirates.&quot;

Connie Mack was the catcher on the 1891 team; he and Hanlon became fast friends and remained close until Hanlon&#x27;s death in 1937. Mack would credit Hanlon with teaching him baseball strategy and how to manage.

The 1891 season was Hanlon&#x27;s last as a full-time player. At age 34, he compiled a .266 batting average and .341 on-base percentage, scored 87 runs, and stole 54 bases. He was also manager of the Alleghenys for most of the 1891 season, during which time the team compiled a record of 31–47.

===Baltimore===

====Rough start====
Hanlon began the 1892 season with Pittsburgh, but he strained a tendon in his right leg in practice before the first game and did not appear in any games. On May 5, 1892, Hanlon signed as captain and manager of the Baltimore Orioles. He took over as manager after George Van Haltren and John Waltz led the team to a 3–16 record in the first 19 games. Hanlon fared only somewhat better than Van Haltren and Waltz, as the team went 43–85 for the remainder of the season and finished 12th (last place) in the National League.

====Assembling the talent====

While Hanlon was not able to immediately turn the Orioles into a winning club, he quickly evaluated the talent available and looked for new talent elsewhere. By 1894, only three players from the 1892 opening lineup (John McGraw, Wilbert Robinson and pitcher Sadie McMahon) remained on the roster. Hanlon&#x27;s efforts to revamp the club included the following:
* Shortstop John McGraw had played only 33 major league games with a .270 batting average before the 1892 season. Under Hanlon&#x27;s tutelage, McGraw became one of the best players in the game, compiling batting averages of .340 in 1894, .369 in 1895, and .325 in 1898. McGraw was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
* Catcher Wilbert Robinson was with the Orioles when Hanlon arrived, but had compiled a .216 batting average in six prior seasons. With Hanlon&#x27;s guidance, Robinson hit .334 in 1893, .353 in 1894, and .347 in 1896. Robinson was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
* In September 1892, Hanlon showed nerve in trading George Van Haltren to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Joe Kelley and cash. Van Haltren was the Orioles&#x27; best hitter, a veteran who had hit compiled a .324 batting average from 1889 to 1891. Kelley was a rookie outfielder who hit .239 for the 1892 Pirates. Kelley promptly became one of the best players in the game, batting .393 in 1894, .365 in 1895 and .364 in 1896. Kelley was later inducted into the Hall of Fame.
* Prior to the 1893 season, Hanlon purchased infielder Heinie Reitz from the San Francisco Metropolitans (California League) for $300. Reitz had compiled a .243 batting average for San Francisco in 1892, but blossomed with Hanlon&#x27;s Orioles. He led the National League&#x27;s second basemen in fielding percentage three times, led the National League in Defensive Wins Above Replacement in 1897, placed fourth in that category in 1894, and led the National League with 31 triples and hit .303 in 1894.
* In June 1893, Hanlon acquired shortstop Hughie Jennings in exchange for Tim O&#x27;Rourke in a trade with the Louisville Colonels. O&#x27;Rourke had been a consistent .300 hitter before the trade, but never hit above .282 after the trade. Jennings had compiled a .242 average with Louisville in three seasons before the trade. At Baltimore, Jennings led the league in fielding percentage every year from 1894 to 1897, and he hit .335 in 1894, .386 in 1895, and .401 in 1896. Jennings was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
* In August 1893, Hanlon purchased outfielder Steve Brodie from the St. Louis Browns for a price reported to be between $800 and $2500. Brodie became a key player in the Orioles&#x27; pennant-winning clubs, batting .366 in 1894 and .348 in 1895.
* In January 1894, Hanlon negotiated a remarkably one-sided trade with the Brooklyn Grooms, acquiring Dan Brouthers and Willie Keeler in exchange for Billy Shindle and George Treadway. Brouthers was an established slugger who had been teammates with Hanlon in Detroit. Brouthers hit .347 and drove in 127 runs for the 1894 Orioles. Keeler had played only 41 games before joining the Orioles, but under Hanlon&#x27;s guidance, Keeler hit .371 in 1894, .377 in 1895, .386 in 1896, and won batting titles in 1897 and 1898 with averages of .424 and .385. Shindle hit .274 in five seasons with Brooklyn, while Treadway hit .301 for two seasons in Brooklyn and was then out of the major leagues. Brouthers and Keeler were both inducted into the Hall of Fame.
*In June 1894, Hanlon made a final key move, purchasing Kid Gleason from the St. Louis Browns for $2,400. Gleason hit .231 in six major league seasons before joining the Orioles. He proved to be a solid fielder at second base and hit .349 for the Orioles in 1894 and .309 in 1895.

For his efforts in building Baltimore&#x27;s championship teams, Hanlon developed a reputation for having a keen eye for talent. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; later wrote that he had &quot;an almost uncanny ability to judge players, a faculty of imparting to them his remarkable store of knowledge, a genius for inspiring his men to rise to the heights and a personality that enabled him to gain and hold the confidence of all with whom he came into contact.&quot;

====Peak years====
By 1894, the Orioles had a lineup with future Hall of Famers at six positions: Robinson at catcher, Brouthers at first, Jennings at shortstop, McGraw at third base, and Keeler and Kelley in the outfield. The team compiled an 89–39 (.695) record and won the first of what would be three consecutive National League pennants.

In May 1895, Hanlon sold Brouthers to the Louisville Cardinals. Brouthers played only 71 games in the major leagues after the trade. Hanlon replaced Brouthers at first base with Scoops Carey in 1895 and &quot;Dirty Jack&quot; Doyle in 1896 and 1897. Doyle hit .339 in 1896 and .354 in 1897 for the Orioles. The 1895 Orioles won their second pennant with a record of 87–43 (.669). In 1896, the team was without Brouthers and Robinson, but won its third consecutive pennant with a 90–39 (.693) record.

The Orioles had further strong performance in 1897 and 1898, compiling records of 90–40 and 96–53, but finished in second place both seasons behind the Boston Beaneaters.

====&quot;Inside baseball&quot;====
During his years in Baltimore, Hanlon became known as &quot;Foxy Ned&quot; and was credited with inventing a new strategy that came to be known as &quot;inside&quot; baseball. The strategy focused on teamwork, speed and execution, and encompassed the hit and run play, the squeeze play, the sacrifice bunt, the double steal, and the Baltimore chop. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; wrote that Hanlon&#x27;s &quot;introduction and perfection of &#x27;inside baseball&#x27;&quot; had &quot;initiated and brought to their highest point of efficiency the hit and run, bunt, sacrifice, chop hit, and base running, always doing the unexpected.&quot; A writer in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted, &quot;It occurred to [Hanlon] that a run gained by strategy counted as big as a run gained by slugging. Accordingly, he evolved an offensive technique that made baseball into something of an art.&quot;

Hanlon introduced the hit and run play during the 1894 season. He took the Orioles to Macon, Georgia, for spring training, a move that was called a &quot;goofy venture&quot; in the press. While in Macon, he practiced and perfected the hit and run. In the opening series of the 1894 season against the New York Giants, Hanlon&#x27;s players ran the hit and run 13 times. New York manager John Montgomery Ward objected to the tactic, claiming that Hanlon &quot;wasn&#x27;t playing baseball, but a new game.&quot; The tactic was deemed to be legal, and Hanlon proudly demonstrated it for fans before games started during the 1894 season.

Hanlon&#x27;s Orioles were also known for their opportunistic play, Willie Keeler famously declaring, &quot;Hit &#x27;em where they ain&#x27;t.&quot; Having been a particularly weak batter against left-handed pitchers, Hanlon learned from his own weakness and was one of the first managers to employ the platoon system, switching players in the lineup depending on whether the opposing pitcher was left- or right-handed.

Connie Mack, who was a player on Hanlon&#x27;s 1891 Pittsburgh club and then an opponent as manager of the Pirates from 1894 to 1896, said, &quot;I always rated Ned Hanlon as the greatest leader baseball ever had. I don&#x27;t believe any man lived who knew as much baseball as he did.&quot;

Hanlon&#x27;s strategic innovations led &quot;The Sporting News&quot; to call him &quot;the game&#x27;s greatest strategist&quot; and led many to call him &quot;The Father of Modern Baseball.&quot;

===Brooklyn===

In October 1898, rumors spread that Hanlon may move to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and take many of the Orioles&#x27; players with him. By December 1898, discussions were underway for a consolidation of the Brooklyn and Baltimore clubs in Brooklyn.

Negotiations continued through the winter, and ultimately a deal was struck which resulted in Hanlon and Baltimore owner Harry Von der Horst receiving stock in the Brooklyn club and with von der Horst as the controlling shareholder of both clubs. Under the deal, Hanlon became the manager of Brooklyn and took Keeler, Kelley and Jennings with him to Brooklyn. The Brooklyn team, formerly known as the Bridegrooms, was dubbed the &quot;Superbas&quot; in the press, simply because the new manager shared the same name as a popular vaudeville acrobatic troupe known as Hanlon&#x27;s Superbas.

Hanlon led his 1899 Superbas to a 101–47 record and a National League pennant. Outfielders Keeler and Kelley led the offense with averages of .379 and .325. On the mound, pitchers Jack Dunn, Jim Hughes and Brickyard Kennedy combined for a 73–28 record.

The 1900 Superbas again won the pennant with an 82–54 record as Keeler and Kelley again led the offense with averages of .362 and .319. Joe McGinnity, later inducted into the Hall of Fame, was acquired from the Orioles in March 1900 and led the pitching staff with a 28–8 record.

Prior to the 1900 season, the Superbas also acquired Jimmy Sheckard from the Orioles. Sheckard hit .354 with 19 triples for Hanlon&#x27;s team in 1901. The Superbas finished the 1901 season in third place with a 79–57 (.581) record. In 1902, Keeler hit .333, but no other player on the Brooklyn team hit above .280. The Superbas again finished the season in third place with a 75–63 record. By 1903, Keeler was gone, and Brooklyn dropped to fifth place with a 70–66 record.

In 1904 and 1905, Hanlon was left with teams that lacked a single .300 hitter. The 1904 team dropped to sixth place with a 56–97 record, and the 1905 team finished in last place with a 48–104 record.

===Cincinnati===
In December 1905, Hanlon signed a contract to manage the Cincinnati Reds during the 1906 season for $8,000 salary. Hanlon was reunited with Joe Kelley in Cincinnati, but Kelley was past his prime and compiled a .228 batting average in 1906. Second baseman Miller Huggins was Hanlon&#x27;s best batsman in 1906 with a .292 average. The Reds finished the 1906 season in sixth place with a 64–87 record. The following season, the Red again finished in sixth place, again lacked a .300 hitter, and compiled a 66–87 record. After the 1907 season, Hanlon retired from managing.

===Baltimore Orioles (minor league)===
The National League Baltimore Orioles franchise folded after the 1899 season, leaving Baltimore without a professional baseball club. An American League version of the Orioles arrived in 1901, but that team moved to New York after the 1902 season and became the New York Yankees. Hoping to keep professional baseball alive in Baltimore, Hanlon in January 1903 purchased the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for $5,000 and moved the club to Baltimore as the newest incarnation of the Baltimore Orioles. Hanlon also purchased the ballpark used by the American League Orioles for $3,000, although it had been built only two years earlier at a cost of $21,000. Hanlon owned the Eastern League Orioles through the 1908 season, but sold the team and ballpark on November 16, 1909, for $70,000 – a profit of more than $60,000 on his 1903 investment of $8,000.

===Baltimore Terrapins===
In November 1913, Hanlon became the principal shareholder in the Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League, a third major league that existed from 1914 to 1915. Hanlon took no role in managing the Terrapins, and the team finished in third place with an 84–70 record in 1914, but dropped to last place in 1915 with a 47–107 record.

The Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season, and most of the Federal League owners were bought out by owners of the American and National Leagues, or were compensated in other ways (for example, the owner of the St. Louis Federal League team was permitted to buy the St. Louis Browns). Hanlon and his co-owners in the Terrapins were not provided with any compensation, and the Terrapins thereupon sued the National and American Leagues for conspiring to monopolize baseball by buying the Federal League&#x27;s other constituent clubs, thereby destroying the Federal League. At trial, the defendants were found jointly liable, and damages of $80,000 assessed, which was tripled to $240,000 ($ in modern dollars), under the provisions of the Clayton Antitrust Act. The judgment was reversed on appeal, ultimately resulting in a United States Supreme Court decision, &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., holding that baseball was not interstate commerce and was therefore not subject to regulation, including antitrust regulation, by the federal government. The case, decided in 1922, is the basis upon which baseball, unlike any other professional sport, still claims an exemption from federal antitrust laws.

===Coaching tree===
Many of those who played on teams managed by Hanlon went on to careers as managers. Prominent examples include:

Additionally, according to Bill James, at one time the great majority of major league managers were part of Hanlon&#x27;s managerial &quot;family tree.&quot;

===Baseball Hall of Fame===
At the time of Hanlon&#x27;s death in April 1937, the Baseball Hall of Fame had not inducted any managers. However, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; observed at the time that, when the Hall was ready to begin inducting the game&#x27;s leading managers, Hanlon&#x27;s place would be assured based on his accomplishments that had &quot;left an indelible print on the annals of the game.&quot; Yet, even when the Hall began inducting managers, beginning in December 1937 with two of Hanlon&#x27;s former players-turned-managers (John McGraw and Connie Mack), Hanlon was overlooked for another 59 years, though he was named to the Hall&#x27;s Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946.

Hanlon was not without nay-sayers who questioned his contributions to the championship teams in Baltimore and Brooklyn. Some opined that the credit for the five pennants rested entirely with his Hall of Fame players—John McGraw, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler. In fact, Hanlon had a 304–441 () record in the portion of his career when he did not have Willie Keeler on his teams. One prominent critic was Sam Crawford who was interviewed in the 1960s—long after Hanlon and most of his colleagues had been deceased – for Lawrence Ritter&#x27;s book, &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;. Although Crawford never played for Hanlon, and did not become a major league starter until 1900, Crawford made the following claim:Ned Hanlon used to manage that Baltimore club, but those old veterans didn&#x27;t pay any attention to him. Heck, they all knew baseball inside out... [T]hose old Baltimore Orioles didn&#x27;t pay any more attention to Ned Hanlon, their manager, than they did to the batboy... He was a bench manager in civilian clothes. When things would get a little tough in a game, Hanlon would sit there on the bench and wring his hands and start telling some of the old-timers what to do. They&#x27;d look at him and say, &#x27;For Christ&#x27;s sake, just keep quiet and leave us alone. We&#x27;ll win this ball game if you only shut up.&#x27;

In 1995, John Steadman of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; published an article urging Hanlon&#x27;s induction. Steadman pointed to Hanlon&#x27;s strategic innovations as being worthy of the Hall, and suggested that Hanlon&#x27;s omission may have been the result of having committed an &quot;unpardonable sin&quot; in suing Major League Baseball for violation of the antitrust laws. In 1996, Hanlon was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame by vote of the Veterans Committee.

==Family and later years==
Hanlon and his wife, Ellen Jane Kelly Hanlon, were wed on February 6, 1890. They had five children: Edward (born 1891), Joseph (born 1893), Mary (born 1895), Helen (born 1898), and Catherine Lillian (born c. 1903).

Hanlon moved to Baltimore when he assumed control of the Orioles in 1892 and lived there for the rest of his life. For more than 30 years, he lived at 1401 Mount Royal Avenue in Baltimore. In 1900 and 1910, Hanlon also had two Irish women working as live-in servants.

In September 1916, Hanlon was appointed to the Baltimore City Board of Park Commissioners. He remained on the Park Board for 21 years and was its chairman beginning in 1931. In 1918, Hanlon&#x27;s son, Joseph, was killed while serving as a lieutenant in the United States Army during action on the Western Front in France during World War I. In January 1920, the Baltimore City Department of Parks on which Hanlon had served on the supervising board, renamed a park off Liberty Heights Avenue in northwest Baltimore as Hanlon Park in honor of Hanlon&#x27;s son; it had formerly been known as Ashburton Park.

In December 1932, Hanlon&#x27;s wife, Helen, died after suffering for several years from a heart ailment. Hanlon died a little more than four years later at age 79. He had been ill for three years and in serious condition for several months when he suffered a heart attack on April 10 and died on April 14, 1937. A requiem mass was held at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church on Mount Royal Avenue in the Bolton Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, and he was interred in the New Cathedral Cemetery on Frederick Road in southwest Baltimore. Hanlon left an estate valued at $128,000 to be shared by his surviving son and three daughters.

<text>Helmstedt (; Eastphalian: &quot;Helmstidde&quot;) is a town on the eastern edge of the German state of Lower Saxony. It is the capital of the District of Helmstedt. The historic university and Hanseatic city conserves an important monumental heritage of Romanesque and Renaissance buildings, as well as numerous timber framed houses. During the German partition the nearby Bundesautobahn 2 was the site of the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing, the most important on the former inner German border as starting point of the shortest land route between West Germany and West Berlin.

==Geography==
Helmstedt is situated in a basin between the Elm and Lappwald hill ranges, at the transition area between the northern foothills of the Harz mountains and the North German Plain. It is surrounded by the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park. The town centre is located about east of Braunschweig, west of Magdeburg, and east of the state capital Hanover.

The municipal area includes the localities of Barmke and Emmerstedt, both incorporated by a 1974 administrative reform, and Büddenstedt, incorporated in 2017, as well as the resort town of Bad Helmstedt, about east of the town centre. Helmstedt currently has about 25,000 inhabitants (2015).

==History==
The settlement in the Duchy of Saxony was first mentioned as &quot;Helmonstede&quot; in a 952 deed issued by the German king Otto I. In former times also called &quot;Helmstädt&quot;, the town developed in the vicinity of the Benedictine St. Ludger&#x27;s Abbey that was founded around 800 by Saint Liudger as a mission station. Helmstedt&#x27;s town privileges were documented in 1247. It belonged to the Abbacy of Werden until 1490, when it was bought by the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. From 1576 to 1810, the University of Helmstedt was located here.

From 1807 the town was part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia, from 1815 it was part of the Duchy of Brunswick, and from 1871 it was part of the German Empire. During World War I, in 1916–1917, Germany operated a special prisoner-of-war camp for ethnic Polish officers from the Russian Army, with the aim of subjecting them to propaganda and conscripting them into a planned German-controlled Polish army to fight against Russia (Poland was partitioned between Germany, Russia and Austria at the time). In 1918, French officers were also detained in this camp, their return began in January 1919.

From the late 1940s to 1990, the town was the site of a major border crossing between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The main rail and autobahn route between West Germany and West Berlin, across the GDR, began at the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing, also known as Checkpoint Alpha. Only official military traffic from NATO countries to West Berlin was allowed to use this route.

The town lies on the Brunswick-Magdeburg railway.

<doc id="697607" wikidata="Q705751" url="?curid=697607" title="Art Taylor">
<text>Arthur S. Taylor Jr. (April 6, 1929 – February 6, 1995) was an American jazz drummer, who &quot;helped define the sound of modern jazz drumming&quot;.

== Early Life ==
Born in New York, United States, Taylor grew up in the Sugar Hill section of Harlem. He was often nicknamed A.T. or Mr. Cool with those who knew him well. 

==Career==
As a teenager, Taylor joined a local Harlem band that featured Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean and Kenny Drew. After playing in the bands of Howard McGhee (1948), Coleman Hawkins (1950–51), Buddy DeFranco (1952), Bud Powell (1953–64), George Wallington and Art Farmer (1954), Wallington again (1954–55), Gigi Gryce and Donald Byrd (1956), he formed his own group, Taylor&#x27;s Wailers. Between 1957 and 1963, he toured with Donald Byrd, recorded with Miles Davis, Gene Ammons and John Coltrane, and performed with Thelonious Monk; Taylor also was a member of the original Kenny Dorham Quartet of 1957.

In 1963, Taylor moved to Europe, where he lived mainly in France and Belgium for 20 years, playing with local groups and jazz musicians such as Johnny Griffin, John Bodwin, and with travelling American musicians, such as Woody Shaw during the latter&#x27;s tenure in Paris. Taylor also studied drums in Paris with Kenny Clarke. He returned to the United States to help his mother, who was ill. He continued freelancing after returning to the United States, and in 1991 organized a second band called Taylor&#x27;s Wailers.

=== 1956-1991: Taylor’s Wailers ===
Taylor formed his own group in 1956, the &quot;Taylor’s Wailers&quot;. They recorded their debut album &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Wailers&quot; in 1957, at the Van Gelder Studio in Hackensack, New Jersey, featuring Taylor‘s incredible talent as a jazz drummer, along with musicians Donald Byrd (trumpeter), Jackie McLean (altoist), Charlie Rouse (tenor), Ray Bryant (pianist), and Wendel Marshall (bassist). Their album features modern hard bop and multiple swinging sessions. Two tracks that stand out are “&quot;Well, You Needn’t&quot;” and “&quot;Off Minor&quot;” compositions of Thelonious Monk. Other outstanding tracks include “C.T.A&quot; which features artists such as John Coltrane, Red Garland and Paul Chambers. In 1992, his group released albums such as &quot;Mr. A.T.&quot; and a live album called &quot;Wailin’ At The Vanguard&quot; recorded in New York City at the Village Vanguard and was his final recording as a leader. 

=== 1997: As an Author ===
He was the author of &quot;Notes and Tones&quot;, a 1977 book based on his interviews with other musicians. This was, for many musicians, a ground-breaking work, because it presented the interviewees&#x27; perspectives on the wider social, political, and economic forces in which they operated – topics normally not mentioned in mainstream coverage of jazz musicians. De Capo Press has released an extended edition of his book which features in-depth interviews of jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, Ornette Coleman and Dizzy Gillespie. Additionally, Taylor shares that his book had helped him put him on the “right track”. Since writing his book, people assumed that he could not play well anymore, which only reignited the fire in himself to play better than he ever had in his life. 

== Styles and Influences ==
Taylor was originally influenced by American drummer J.C. Heard, who had “solidified his vision in becoming a drummer”. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Modern Drummer Magazine&quot; he shares childhood memories of his father taking him to the Apollo Theatre, to see J.C. Heard and other artists such as Duke Basie, Buddy Rich and Charlie Barnet. Other influential names in his lifetime included Big Sid Catlett, Philly Joe Jonas, Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, and Kenny Clarke who had encouraged him to study music. Taylor also reveals in a 1994 voice recording interview by The National Public Radio (NPR) that he first studied drums in Paris with Kenny Clarke. He explained that he was self-trained, but felt encouraged by Clarke to continue studying music. He states “Kenny always tried to encourage me… He said you’re gonna be better, you&#x27;re gonna be better…”. While Kenny Clarke is regarded as one of the larger influences from his time in France, Taylor noted that Art Blakey and Max Roach were his most important influences on his personal style of jazz. He expresses his admiration for the technique and control of Max’s playing, the finesse of Philly Joe and the Power of Blakey. “I took something from all those people. I know I have, because when I hear a drummer play something I like, I learn to play. After playing it for a long time, it isn’t like something you stole from somebody else. It becomes almost your own, because you sure can&#x27;t play it like anybody else did…” . His rhythmic conception is also influenced by Bud Powel’s piano rhythms, which he incorporates into his drum playing. Their collaboration can be heard also in Powell’s live recording &quot;Birdland 1953: The Complete Trio Recording&quot;. Songs including “&quot;Moose the Mooche&quot;”, “&quot;Cheryl&quot;”, “&quot;Budo&quot;”, and “&quot;Poco Loco&quot;” featuring Taylor as the drummer (cite). He can also be heard in John Coltrane’s album “&quot;Giant Steps&quot;” and Mile Davis’s “&quot;Miles Ahead&quot;”, expanding his horizon as a collaborative artist. 

== Teaching Philosophy ==
Taylor mentions a few students he took under his wing, from places such as Germany, Australia, and Japan and would come into the United States once a year and take multiple lessons. Taylor emphasized the importance of playing the bass drum on every beat of the song to become a better drummer and build a foundation for other musicians to play on. 

== Death ==
He died aged 65 in Beth Israel Hospital, Manhattan, in 1995. In 1995 Taylor’s last recording session was also with Jimmy Smith on the album “Damn!” which was dedicated in his memory.

== Legacy ==
Art Taylor was known to be one of the greatest drummers of the 1950s but has been hidden behind the big names he played with and recorded an astonishing 323 sessions. His incredible skills and talent was not the only notable aspect, but his team player characteristics made him well integrated into the jazz community. His band member, John Coltrane described how he hired Taylor to record with him because his playing “doesn’t interfere with his”. Whether playing with Johnny Griffin, Jackie McLean, Dexter Gordon or Coleman Hawkins, he pays careful attention to the individual’s sound and tone. When practicing to perform, he shares that he is a “slow learner” compared to other drummers, but has “kept learning”. Once learning a section, or arrangement he never forgets it, helping his members play their sections when needed.  Taylor’s ability to adapt and play “with” the musician&#x27;s playing style, rather than “at” them has made him a versatile musician on his own.

<text>Daniel Edgar Sickles (October 20, 1819May 3, 1914) was an American politician, soldier, and diplomat.

Born to a wealthy family in New York City, Sickles was involved in a number of scandals, most notably the 1859 homicide of his wife&#x27;s lover, U.S. Attorney Philip Barton Key II, whom Sickles gunned down in broad daylight in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. He was acquitted after using temporary insanity as a legal defense for the first time in United States history.

Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Sickles became one of the war&#x27;s most prominent political generals, recruiting the New York regiments that became known as the Excelsior Brigade in the Army of the Potomac. Despite his lack of military experience, he served as a brigade, division, and corps commander in some of the early Eastern campaigns. His military career ended at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, after he moved his III Corps without orders to an untenable position, where they suffered 40% casualties but slowed General James Longstreet&#x27;s flanking maneuver. Sickles himself was wounded by cannon fire at Gettysburg and had to have his leg amputated. He was eventually awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

Sickles devoted considerable effort to trying to gain credit for helping achieve the Union victory at Gettysburg, writing articles and testifying before Congress in a manner that denigrated the intentions and actions of his superior officer, Maj. Gen. George Meade. After the war, Sickles was appointed as a commander for military districts in the South during Reconstruction. He also served as U.S. Minister to Spain under President Ulysses S. Grant. Later he was re-elected to Congress, where he helped pass legislation to preserve the Gettysburg Battlefield.

==Early life and politics==
In 1819, Sickles was born in New York City to Susan Marsh Sickles and George Garrett Sickles, a patent lawyer and politician. (His year of birth is sometimes given as 1825, and Sickles was known to have claimed as such. Historians speculate that Sickles chose to appear younger when he married a woman half his age.) He learned the printer&#x27;s trade and studied at the University of the City of New York (now New York University). He studied law in the office of Benjamin Butler, was admitted to the bar in 1843, and was elected as a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co.) in 1847.

On September 27, 1852, Sickles married Teresa Bagioli against the wishes of both families—he was 32, she about 15 or 16. She was reported as sophisticated for her age, speaking five languages.

In 1853 Sickles became corporation counsel of New York City, but resigned soon afterward when appointed as secretary of the U.S. legation in London, under James Buchanan, by appointment of President Franklin Pierce. In 1855 he returned to the United States, and in 1856 he was elected as a member of the New York State Senate in the 3rd district. He was re-elected to the seat in 1857. In 1856 he was also elected as a Democrat to the 35th U.S. Congress, and held office from March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1861, a total of two terms.

Sickles was censured by the New York State Assembly for escorting a known prostitute, Fanny White, into the Assembly&#x27;s chambers. He also reportedly took her to England, while leaving his pregnant wife at home. He presented White to Queen Victoria, using as her alias the surname of a New York political opponent.

===Homicide of Philip Key===

On February 27, 1859, in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House, Sickles shot and killed Philip Barton Key II, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and the son of Francis Scott Key. Sickles had discovered that Philip Key was having an affair with his wife, Teresa Bagioli Sickles.
===Trial===

Sickles surrendered at Attorney General Jeremiah Black&#x27;s house, a few blocks away on Franklin Square, and confessed to the murder. After a visit to his home, accompanied by a constable, Sickles was taken to jail. He received numerous perquisites, including being allowed to retain his personal weapon, and receive numerous visitors. So many visitors came that he was granted the use of the head jailer&#x27;s apartment to receive them. They included many congressmen, senators, and other leading members of Washington society. President James Buchanan sent Sickles a personal note.
&quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported that the visits of his wife&#x27;s mother and her clergyman were painful for Sickles. Both told him that Teresa was distracted with grief, shame, and sorrow, and that the loss of her wedding ring (which Sickles had taken on visiting his home) was more than Teresa could bear.

Sickles was charged with murder. He secured several leading politicians as defense attorneys, among them Edwin Stanton, later to become Secretary of War, and Chief Counsel James T. Brady who, like Sickles, was associated with Tammany Hall. Sickles pleaded temporary insanity—the first use of this defense in the United States. Before the jury, Stanton argued that Sickles had been driven insane by his wife&#x27;s infidelity, and thus was out of his mind when he shot Key. The papers soon trumpeted that Sickles was a hero for &quot;saving all the ladies of Washington from this rogue named Key.&quot;

Sickles had obtained a graphic confession from Teresa; it was ruled inadmissible in court, but was leaked by him to the press and printed in the newspapers in full. The defense strategy ensured that the trial was the main topic of conversations in Washington for weeks, and the extensive coverage of national papers was sympathetic to Sickles. In the courtroom, the strategy brought drama, controversy, and, ultimately, an acquittal for Sickles.

Sickles publicly forgave Teresa, and &quot;withdrew&quot; briefly from public life, although he did not resign from Congress. The public was apparently more outraged by Sickles&#x27;s forgiveness and reconciliation with his wife than by the murder and his unorthodox acquittal.

==Civil War==
In the 1850s, Sickles had received a commission in the 12th Regiment of the New York Militia, and had attained the rank of major (he insisted on wearing his militia uniform for ceremonial occasions while serving in London, and caused a minor diplomatic scandal by snubbing Queen Victoria at an Independence Day celebration).

At the outbreak of the Civil War, Sickles worked to repair his public image by raising volunteer units in New York for the Union Army. Because of his previous military experience and political connections, he was appointed colonel of one (the 70th New York Infantry) of the four regiments he organized. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in September 1861, where he was notorious before beginning any fighting.

According to author Garry Boulard&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Sickles: A Life,&quot; Sickles not only refused to return runaway slaves who escaped to his Union camp in Northern Virginia, he put many of them on the federal payroll as servants, while also training male slaves to be soldiers. It was a policy that won for him the approval of the influential Committee on the Conduct of the War.
In March 1862, he was forced to relinquish his command when the U.S. Congress refused to confirm his commission. He lobbied his Washington political contacts and reclaimed both his rank and his command on May 24, 1862, in time to rejoin the Army in the Peninsula Campaign. Because of this interruption, Sickles missed his brigade&#x27;s significant actions at the Battle of Williamsburg. Despite his lack of previous combat experience, he did a competent job commanding the &quot;Excelsior Brigade&quot; of the Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. He was absent for the Second Battle of Bull Run, having used his political influences to obtain leave to go to New York City to recruit new troops. He also missed the Battle of Antietam because the III Corps, to which he was assigned as a division commander, was stationed on the lower Potomac, protecting the capital.

Sickles was a close ally of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, his original division commander, who eventually commanded the Army of the Potomac. Both men had notorious reputations as political climbers and as hard-drinking ladies&#x27; men.

Sickles&#x27; division was in reserve at the Battle of Fredericksburg. On January 16, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Sickles for promotion to the grade of major general to rank from November 29, 1862. Although the U.S. Senate did not confirm the promotion until March 9, 1863, and the President did not formally appoint Sickles until March 11, 1863, Hooker, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, gave Sickles command of the III Corps in February 1863.

This decision was controversial as Sickles became the only corps commander without a West Point military education. His energy and ability were conspicuous in the Battle of Chancellorsville. He aggressively recommended pursuing troops he saw in his sector on May 2, 1863. Sickles thought the Confederates were retreating, but these turned out to be elements of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s corps, stealthily marching around the Union flank. He also vigorously opposed Hooker&#x27;s orders moving him off good defensive terrain in Hazel Grove. In both of these cases, it is easy to imagine the disastrous battle turning out very differently for the Union if Hooker had heeded his advice.

===Gettysburg===

The Battle of Gettysburg was the occasion of the most famous incident and the effective end of Sickles&#x27; military career. On July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade ordered Sickles&#x27; corps to take up defensive positions on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge, anchored in the north to the II Corps and to the south, the hill known as Little Round Top. Sickles was unhappy to see the &quot;Peach Orchard,&quot; a slightly higher terrain feature, to his front. Concerned over his position and uncertain of Meade&#x27;s exact intentions, a little after 2 p.m. he began to march his corps out to the Peach Orchard, almost a mile in front of Cemetery Ridge. This had two effects: it greatly diluted the concentrated defensive posture of his corps by stretching it too thin, and it created a salient that could be bombarded and attacked from multiple sides. Soon thereafter (3 p.m.), Meade called a meeting of his corps commanders. An aide to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren soon reported the situation. Sickles arrived just after the meeting had ended. Meade and Warren rode with Sickles back to his position, where Meade explained Sickles&#x27; error. Meade refused Sickles&#x27; offer to withdraw because he realized it was too late and the Confederates would soon attack, putting a retreating force in even greater peril.

The Confederates attacked at about the time Meade spoke with Sickles and then returned to his headquarters. The Confederate assault by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s corps, primarily by the division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, smashed the III Corps and rendered it useless for further combat. Gettysburg campaign historian Edwin B. Coddington assigns &quot;much of the blame for the near disaster&quot; in the center of the Union line to Sickles. Stephen W. Sears wrote that &quot;Dan Sickles, in not obeying Meade&#x27;s explicit orders, risked both his Third Corps and the army&#x27;s defensive plan on July 2.&quot; However, Sickles&#x27; maneuver has recently been credited by John Keegan with blunting the whole Confederate offensive that was intended to cause the collapse of the Union line. Similarly, James M. McPherson wrote that &quot;Sickles&#x27;s unwise move may have unwittingly foiled Lee&#x27;s hopes.&quot;

During the height of the Confederate attack, Sickles was wounded by a cannonball that mangled his right leg. He was carried by a detail of soldiers to the shade of the Trostle farmhouse, where a saddle strap was applied as a tourniquet. He ordered his aide, Major Harry Tremain, &quot;Tell General Birney he must take command.&quot; As Sickles was carried by stretcher to the III Corps hospital on the Taneytown Road, he attempted to raise his soldiers&#x27; spirits by grinning and puffing on a cigar along the way. His leg was amputated that afternoon. He insisted on being transported to Washington, D.C., which he reached on July 4, 1863. He brought some of the first news of the great Union victory, and started a public relations campaign to defend his behavior in the conflict. On the afternoon of July 5, President Lincoln and his son, Tad, visited General Sickles, as he was recovering in Washington.
Sickles had recent knowledge of a new directive from the Army Surgeon General to collect and forward &quot;specimens of morbid anatomy ... together with projectiles and foreign bodies removed&quot; to the newly founded Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C. He preserved the bones from his leg and donated them to the museum in a small coffin-shaped box, along with a visiting card marked, &quot;With the compliments of Major General D.E.S.&quot; Upon his first visit to the limb, Sickles allegedly berated the museum for not preserving his foot as well. For several years thereafter, he reportedly visited the limb on the anniversary of the amputation. The museum, now known as the National Museum of Health and Medicine, still displays this artifact. (Other Civil War-era specimens of note on display include the hip of General Henry Barnum.)

Sickles ran a vicious campaign against General Meade&#x27;s character after Gettysburg. Sickles felt that Meade had wronged him and that he deserved credit for winning the battle. In anonymous newspaper articles and in testimony before a congressional committee, Sickles falsely maintained that Meade had secretly planned to retreat from Gettysburg on the first day. He also claimed to have occupied Little Round Top on July 2. While his movement away from Cemetery Ridge may have violated orders, Sickles always asserted that it was the correct move because it disrupted the Confederate attack, redirecting its thrust, and effectively shielding the Union&#x27;s real objectives, Cemetery Ridge and Cemetery Hill. Sickles&#x27;s redeployment took Confederate commanders by surprise, and historians have argued about its ramifications ever since.

Sickles eventually received the Medal of Honor for his actions, although it took him 34 years to get it. The official citation accompanying his medal recorded that Sickles &quot;displayed most conspicuous gallantry on the field, vigorously contesting the advance of the enemy and continuing to encourage his troops after being himself severely wounded.&quot;

==Postbellum career==

Despite his one-legged disability, Sickles remained in the army until the end of the war and was disgusted that Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant would not allow him to return to a combat command. In 1867, he received appointments as brevet brigadier general and major general in the regular army for his services at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg, respectively.

Soon after the close of the Civil War, in 1865, he was sent on a confidential mission to Colombia (the &quot;special mission to the South American Republics&quot;) to secure its compliance with a treaty agreement of 1846 permitting the United States to convey troops across the Isthmus of Panama. From 1865 to 1867, he commanded the Department of South Carolina, the Department of the Carolinas, the Department of the South, and the Second Military District. Sickles pursued Reconstruction on a basis of fair treatment for African-Americans and respect for the rights of employees. He halted foreclosures on property. He also made the wages of farm laborers the first lien on crops. He outlawed discrimination against African-Americans and banned the production of whisky.

In 1866, he was appointed colonel of the 42nd U.S. Infantry (Veteran Reserve Corps), and in 1869 he was retired with the rank of major general.

Sickles served as U.S. Minister to Spain from 1869 to 1874, after the Senate failed to confirm Henry Shelton Sanford to the post, and took part in the negotiations growing out of the Virginius Affair. His inaccurate and emotional messages to Washington promoted war, until he was overruled by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and the war scare died out.

In his &quot;Daniel Sickles: A Life&quot; Garry Boulard points out that Sickles was disadvantaged throughout the Virginius controversy, trying to negotiate with a Spanish leadership that was frequently disorganized and chaotic, while the substantial talks were taking place in Washington between Fish and Spanish Minister Don Jose Polo de Barnabe. Even so, when Sickles subsequently decided to turn in his resignation, Fish, who was not displeased with Sickles&#x27; service, wired the General: &quot;You are recalled on your own request.&quot;

Sickles maintained his reputation as a ladies&#x27; man in the Spanish royal court and was rumored to have had an affair with the deposed Queen Isabella II. Following the death of Teresa in 1867, in 1871 he married Carmina Creagh (aka de Creagh), the daughter of French-born Chevalier de Creagh, of Madrid, a Spanish Councillor of State. They had two children.

Starting in the 1880s and continuing until nearly the end of his life, Sickles frequently attended and spoke at Gettysburg reunions as the former commander of the III Corps in the victorious Army of the Potomac, popular with many of the veterans who had served under his command. He also struck up a friendship with former opponent James Longstreet, one who was also seeking to defend himself from attacks (many politically motivated in Longstreet&#x27;s case) over his war performance. Sickles&#x27; popularity with veterans was not universal, however, because of his inflated claims that he was the ultimate father of the Union victory and his repeated attacks against George Meade, even after Meade&#x27;s death in 1872, with falsehoods about Meade wanting to retreat from Gettysburg.
The New York Monuments Commission was formed in 1886 and Sickles was appointed honorary chairman. He served the commission zealously for most of the rest of his life in securing appropriations for monuments to New York regiments, batteries, and commanders and having them placed correctly on the Gettysburg battlefield. He was forced out of the Commission in 1912, however, when $27,000 was found to have been embezzled. Sickles was appointed as chairman of the New York State Civil Service Commission from 1888 to 1889, and Sheriff of New York County in 1890. In 1891, he was elected to the board of the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association. In 1892, he was elected again as a Democratic representative in the 53rd Congress, serving from 1893 to 1895.
As a congressman, Sickles had an important part in efforts to preserve the Gettysburg Battlefield, sponsoring legislation to form the Gettysburg National Military Park, buy up private lands, and erect monuments. He procured the original fencing used on East Cemetery Hill to mark the park&#x27;s borders. This fencing came directly from Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. In fact, the park&#x27;s borders were defined from its establishment until 1974 by a map prepared by Sickles.

Of the principal senior generals who fought at Gettysburg, virtually all, with the conspicuous exception of Sickles, have been memorialized with statues. When asked why there was no memorial to him, Sickles supposedly said, &quot;The entire battlefield is a memorial to Sickles.&quot; The monument to the New York Excelsior Brigade was originally commissioned to include a bust of Sickles, but it includes a figure of an eagle instead.

==Death==
Sickles lived out the remainder of his life in New York City, dying of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 3, 1914, at the age of 94. His funeral was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan on May 8, 1914. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Abortion laws vary widely among countries and territories, and have changed over time. Such laws range from abortion being freely available on request, to regulation or restrictions of various kinds, to outright prohibition in all circumstances. Many countries and territories that allow abortion have gestational limits for the procedure depending on the reason; with the majority being up to 12 weeks for abortion on request, up to 24 weeks for rape, incest, or socioeconomic reasons, and more for fetal impairment or risk to the woman&#x27;s health or life. As of 2022, countries that legally allow abortion on request or for socioeconomic reasons comprise about 60% of the world&#x27;s population. In 2024, France became the first country to explicitly protect abortion rights in its constitution, while Yugoslavia implicitly inscribed abortion rights in its constitution in 1974.

Abortion continues to be a controversial subject in many societies on religious, moral, ethical, practical, and political grounds. Though it has been banned and otherwise limited by law in many jurisdictions, abortions continue to be common in many areas, even where they are illegal. According to a 2007 study conducted by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health Organization, abortion rates are similar in countries where the procedure is legal and in countries where it is not, due to unavailability of modern contraceptives in areas where abortion is illegal. Also according to the study, the number of abortions worldwide is declining due to increased access to contraception.

==History==

Abortion has existed since ancient times, with natural abortifacients being found amongst a wide variety of tribal people and in most written sources. The earliest known records of abortion techniques and general reproductive regulation date as far back as 2700 BC in China, and 1550 BC in Egypt. Early texts contain little mention of abortion or abortion law. When it does appear, it is entailed in concerns about male property rights, preservation of social order, and the duty to produce fit citizens for the state or community. The harshest penalties were generally reserved for a woman who procured an abortion against her husband&#x27;s wishes, and for slaves who produced abortion in a woman of high status. Religious texts often contained severe condemnations of abortion, recommending penance but seldom enforcing secular punishment. As a matter of common law in England and the United States, abortion was illegal anytime after quickening—when the movements of the fetus could first be felt by the woman. Under the born alive rule, the fetus was not considered a &quot;reasonable being&quot; &quot;in rerum natura&quot;; and abortion was not treated as murder in English law.

In the 19th century, many Western countries began to codify abortion laws or place further restrictions on the practice. Anti-abortion movements were led by a combination of groups opposed to abortion on moral grounds, and by medical professionals who were concerned about the danger presented by the procedure and the regular involvement of non-medical personnel in performing abortions. Nevertheless, it became clear that illegal abortions continued to take place in large numbers even where abortions were rigorously restricted. It was difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the women and abortion doctors, and judges and juries were often reluctant to convict. For example, Henry Morgentaler, a Canadian pro-choice advocate, was never convicted by a jury. He was acquitted by a jury in the 1973 court case, but the acquittal was overturned by five judges on the Quebec Court of Appeal in 1974. He went to prison, appealed, and was again acquitted. In total, he served 10 months, suffering a heart attack while in solitary confinement. Many were also outraged at the invasion of privacy and the medical problems resulting from abortions taking place illegally in medically dangerous circumstances. Political movements soon coalesced around the legalization of abortion and liberalization of existing laws.

By the first half of the 20th century, many countries had begun to liberalize abortion laws, at least when performed to protect the woman&#x27;s life and in some cases on the woman&#x27;s request. Under Vladimir Lenin, the Soviet Union became the first modern state in legalizing abortions on request—the law was first introduced in the Russian SFSR in 1920, in the Ukrainian SSR in July 1921, and then in the whole country. The Bolsheviks saw abortion as a social evil created by the capitalist system, which left women without the economic means to raise children, forcing them to perform abortions. The Soviet state initially preserved the tsarist ban on abortion, which treated the practice as premeditated murder. However, abortion had been practiced by Russian women for decades and its incidence skyrocketed further as a result of the Russian Civil War, which had left the country economically devastated and made it extremely difficult for many people to have children. The Soviet state recognized that banning abortion would not stop the practice because women would continue using the services of private abortionists. In rural areas, these were often old women who had no medical training, which made their services very dangerous to women&#x27;s health. In November 1920, the Soviet government legalized abortion in state hospitals. The state considered abortion as a temporary necessary evil, which would disappear in the future communist society, which would be able to provide for all the children conceived. In 1936, Joseph Stalin placed prohibitions on abortions, which restricted them to medically recommended cases only, in order to increase population growth after the enormous loss of life in World War I and the Russian Civil War. In the 1930s, several countries (Poland, Turkey, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Mexico) legalized abortion in some special cases (pregnancy from rape, threat to mother&#x27;s health, fetal malformation). In Japan, abortion was legalized in 1948 by the Eugenic Protection Law, amended in May 1949 to allow abortions for economic reasons. Abortion was legalized in 1952 in Yugoslavia (on a limited basis), and again in 1955 in the Soviet Union on request. Some Soviet allies (Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania) legalized abortion in the late 1950s under pressure from the Soviets.

In the United Kingdom, the Abortion Act of 1967 clarified and prescribed abortions as legal up to 28 weeks (later reduced to 24 weeks). Other countries soon followed, including Canada (1969), the United States (1973 in most states, pursuant to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;—the U.S. Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion nationwide), Tunisia and Denmark (1973), Austria (1974), France and Sweden (1975), New Zealand (1977), Italy (1978), the Netherlands (1984), and Belgium (1990). However, these countries vary greatly in the circumstances under which abortion was to be permitted. In 1975, the West German Supreme Court struck down a law legalizing abortion, holding that they contradict the constitution&#x27;s human rights guarantees. In 1976, a law was adopted which enabled abortions up to 12 weeks. After Germany&#x27;s reunification, despite the legal status of abortion in former East Germany, a compromise was reached which deemed most abortions up to 12 weeks legal, but this law was struck down by the Federal Constitutional Court and amended to only remove the punishment in such cases, without any statement to legality. In jurisdictions governed under sharia law, abortion after the 120th day from conception (19 weeks from LMP) is illegal, especially for those who follow the recommendations of the Hanafi legal school, while most jurists of the Maliki legal school &quot;believe that ensoulment occurs at the moment of conception, and they tend to forbid abortion at any point [similar to the Roman Catholic Church]. The other schools hold intermediate positions. ... The penalty prescribed for an illegal abortion varies according to particular circumstances involved. According to sharia, it should be limited to a fine that is paid to the father or heirs of the fetus.&quot;

==Timeline of abortion on request==
The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of 2024, 67 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request.

;Notes
Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included, leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Countries where abortion on request was once legalized nationwide but has since been prohibited in at least part of the country, such as the United States and Poland, are also excluded. Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved.

==International law==
There are no international or multinational treaties that deal directly with abortion but human rights law and international criminal law touch on the issues.

The Nuremberg Military Tribunal decided the case of &quot;United States v Greifelt and Others&quot; (1948) on the basis that abortion was a crime within its jurisdiction according to the law defining crimes against humanity and thus within its definition of murder and extermination.

The Catholic Church remains highly influential in Latin America, and opposes the legalisation of abortion. The American Convention on Human Rights, which in 2013 had 23 Latin American parties, declares human life as commencing with conception. In Latin America, abortion on request is only legal in Cuba (1965), Uruguay (2012), Argentina (2021), Colombia (2022) and in parts of Mexico. Abortions are completely banned in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, and only allowed in certain restricted circumstances in most other Latin American nations.

In the 2010 case of &quot;A, B and C v Ireland&quot;, the European Court of Human Rights found that the European Convention on Human Rights did not include a right to an abortion.

In 2005, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UN HRC) ordered Peru to compensate a woman (known as K.L.) for denying her a medically indicated abortion; this was the first time a United Nations Committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe, legal abortion, and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right. K.L. received the compensation in 2016. In the 2016 case of &quot;Mellet v Ireland&quot;, the UN HRC found Ireland&#x27;s abortion laws violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because Irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities.

==National laws==
While abortions are legal at least under certain conditions in almost all countries, these conditions vary widely. According to a United Nations (UN) report with data gathered up to 2019, abortion is allowed in 98% of countries in order to save a woman&#x27;s life. Other commonly-accepted reasons are preserving physical (72%) or mental health (69%), in cases of rape or incest (61%), and in cases of fetal impairment (61%). Performing an abortion because of economic or social reasons is accepted in 37% of countries. Performing abortion only on the basis of a woman&#x27;s request is allowed in 34% of countries, including in Canada, most European countries and China.

The exact scope of each legal ground also varies. For example, the laws of some countries cite health risks and fetal impairment as general grounds for abortion and allow a broad interpretation of such terms in practice, while other countries restrict them to a specific list of medical conditions or subcategories. Many countries that allow abortion have gestational limits for the procedure depending on the reason; with the majority being up to 12 weeks for abortion on request, up to 24 weeks for social, economic, rape, or incest reasons, and more for fetal impairment or threats to the woman&#x27;s health or life.

In some countries, additional procedures must be followed before the abortion can be carried out even if the basic grounds for it are met. How strictly all of the procedures dictated in the legislation are followed in practice is another matter. For example, in the United Kingdom, a Care Quality Commission&#x27;s report in 2012 found that several NHS clinics were circumventing the law, using forms pre-signed by one doctor, thus allowing abortions to patients who only met with one doctor.

===Summary tables===
====Countries====
The table below summarizes the legal grounds for abortion in all United Nations member states and United Nations General Assembly observer states and some countries with limited recognition. This table is mostly based on data compiled by the United Nations up to 2019, with some updates, additions and clarifications citing other sources.

====Autonomous jurisdictions====
The table below summarizes the legal grounds for abortion in autonomous jurisdictions not included in the previous table.

===Comparative limits for countries with elective abortions===

Legal limits may not be directly comparable. Limits may be expressed in trimesters, months, weeks of pregnancy (implantation), weeks from fertilization, or weeks from last menstrual period (LMP).


===Countries with more restrictive laws===

According to a report by Women on Waves, approximately 25% of the world&#x27;s population lives in countries with &quot;highly restrictive abortion laws&quot;—that is, laws which either completely ban abortion, or allow it only to save the mother&#x27;s life. This category includes several countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Oceania, as well as Andorra and Malta in Europe. The Center for Reproductive Rights report that &quot;[t]he inability to access safe and legal abortion care impacts 700 million women of reproductive age.&quot;

Some of the countries of Central America, notably El Salvador, have also come to international attention due to very forceful enforcement of the laws, including the incarceration of a gang-rape victim for homicide when she gave birth to a stillborn son and was accused of attempting an illegal abortion.

El Salvador has some of the strictest abortion laws of any country. Abortion under all circumstances, including rape, incest, and risk to the mother&#x27;s health, is illegal. Women can be criminalized and penalized to up to 40 years in prison after being found guilty of an abortion. El Salvador&#x27;s abortion laws are so severe that miscarriages and stillbirths can sometimes be enough for conviction. The Inter-American Court has already ruled that El Salvador was responsible for the death of Manuela, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008 for aggravated homicide after suffering an obstetric emergency that resulted in her losing her pregnancy.

===Beginning of pregnancy controversy===

Controversy over the beginning of pregnancy occurs in different contexts, particularly in a legal context, and is particularly discussed within the abortion debate from the point of measuring the gestational age of the pregnancy. Pregnancy can be measured from a number of convenient points, including the day of last menstruation, ovulation, fertilization, implantation and chemical detection. A common medical way to calculate gestational age is to measure pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual cycle. However, not all legal systems use this measure for the purpose of abortion law; for example countries such as Belgium, France, and Luxembourg use the term &quot;pregnancy&quot; in the abortion law to refer to the time elapsed from the sexual act that led to conception, which is presumed to be 2 weeks after the end of the last menstrual period.

==Exceptions in abortion law==
Exceptions in abortion laws occur either in countries where abortion is as a general rule illegal or in countries that have abortion on request with gestational limits. For example, if a country allows abortion on request until 12 weeks, it may create exceptions to this general gestation limit for later abortions in specific circumstances.

There are a few exceptions commonly found in abortion laws. Legal domains which do not have abortion on demand will often allow it when the health of the mother is at stake. &quot;Health of the mother&quot; may mean something different in different areas: for example, prior to December 2018, Ireland allowed abortion only to save the mother&#x27;s life, whereas abortion opponents in the United States argue health exceptions are used so broadly as to render a ban essentially meaningless.

Laws allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest often differ. For example, before &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, thirteen U.S. states allowed abortion in the case of either rape or incest, but only Mississippi permitted abortion of pregnancies due to rape, and no state permitted it for just incest.

Many countries allow abortion only through the first or second trimester, and some may allow abortion in cases of fetal defects, e.g., Down syndrome, or where the pregnancy is the result of a sexual crime.

==Other related laws==

Laws in some countries with liberal abortion laws protect access to abortion services. Such legislation often seeks to guard abortion clinics against obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect patients and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.
Other laws create a perimeter around a facility, known variously as a &quot;buffer zone&quot;, &quot;bubble zone&quot;, or &quot;access zone&quot;, where demonstrations opposing abortion are not permitted. Protests and other displays are restricted to a certain distance from the building, which varies depending on the law. Similar zones have also been created to protect the homes of abortion providers and clinic staff. Bubble zone laws are divided into &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;floating&quot; categories. Fixed bubble zone laws apply to the static area around the facility itself, and floating laws to objects in transit, such as people or cars. Because of conflicts between anti-abortion activists on one side and women seeking abortion and medical staff who provides abortion on the other side, some laws are quite strict: in South Africa for instance, any person who prevents the lawful termination of a pregnancy or obstructs access to a facility for the termination of a pregnancy faces up to 10 years in prison (section 10.1 (c) of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act).

On 3 November 2020, an association of 20 Kenyan charities urged the government of Kenya to withdraw from the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD), a US-led international accord that sought to limit access to abortion for girls and women around the world. GCD was signed by 33 nations, on 22 October 2020.
