<text>The River Mapocho () (Mapudungun: &quot;Mapu chuco&quot;, &quot;water that penetrates the land&quot;) is a river in Chile. It flows from its source in the Andes mountains onto the west and divides Chile&#x27;s capital Santiago in two.

==Course==
The Mapocho begins at the confluence of the San Francisco River and Molina River in the Andes. The main tributary of the former is Yerba Loca Creek, which drains the protected area that bears its same name. Molina River is fed by Iver Glacier, which lies on Cerro El Plomo. A few kilometres westward from its source, the Mapocho receives the waters of the Arrayán Creek and enters to the urban area of Santiago.

The last western spurs of the Andes in this area force a change in the direction of the river, making that it begin to flow toward the south. In the vicinity of Cerro San Cristóbal and just to the side of the Costanera Center project, the river collects the waters of the Canal San Carlos. From here, the river flows in a generally southwesterly direction to Plaza Baquedano area, which is a focal point of the city and the site where formerly the Mapocho split into two branches. The southern branch was turned into a promenade during the early years of the republic, and is now the Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins avenue.

The river then turns northwest. In this portion of its course, some of the most meaningful landmarks of the city, arose along its southern bank. Those include the Parque Forestal, the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the Mercado Central and the Estación Mapocho. Farther northwest, two highway bridges connect the north and south sides of the river, which are part of the two branches of the Autopista Central.

Approximately at the longitude of the summit of Cerro Renca, the Mapocho changes its northwesterly flow to a southwesterly direction. From the southern portion of Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport, the river turns south, to its outfall into the Maipo River.

==Cultural role==

Until the 19th century, the river was the north border of Santiago, hence it was the arrival place for trains from north Chile, at the Estación Mapocho, later also the bus station to the north. Also the Vega Central, the main business place for provisioning Santiago with foods as well as the Mercado Central. Until the first half of the 20th century the (channeled) riverbed was meeting point of homeless people and petty criminals.

Since the 1970s the walls of the &quot;channel&quot; in Santiago, seen daily by thousands &quot;Santiaguinos&quot; have been used for political propaganda. Every year a Hazing Regatta sails the river downwards during the celebrations of the beginning of the year at the University of Chile.

==Pollution==
In March 2009, only 68% of the wastewater in Santiago was treated, though this increased to 81% by the end of the year.

The Mapocho remains contaminated by household, agricultural and industrial sewage, and by upstream copper-mining waste (from the several copper mines in the Andes, east of Santiago), being dumped unfiltered into the river. Laws force industry and local governments to process all their wastewater, but are loosely enforced. There are now a number of large wastewater processing and recycling plants under construction. There are ongoing plans to decontaminate the river and make it navigable.

== Floods ==
In April 2016, following heavy rain, the swollen river flooded property in Santiago and contaminated the drinking water supply for millions of people.

<text>William Jones Lowndes (February 11, 1782 – October 27, 1822) was an American lawyer, planter, and politician from South Carolina. He represented the state in the U.S. Congress from 1811 to May 8, 1822, when he resigned for health reasons.

==Early life==
The son of Rawlins Lowndes (1721–1800), multi-term legislator and briefly governor of South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, William Lowndes was one of three children born to Rawlins Lowndes&#x27; third wife, the former Sarah Jones (1757-1801), daughter of Col. Charles Jones of Georgia.

His paternal grandfather, Charles Lowndes, had moved his family from St. Kitts in the British West Indies in 1730 to South Carolina, but his extravagant spending led to financial ruin. After he committed suicide, his sons Charles and Rawlins were placed in the care of Robert Hall, then the provost-marshal of South Carolina (its chief law enforcement officer). Rawlins Lowndes succeeded Hall in 1745 but resigned for health reasons in 1754. In addition to his legal practice and civic duties, Rawlins Lowndes acquired plantations through marriage, which he farmed using enslaved labor. He acquired his first plantation along the Stono River in St. Paul Parish in 1748 (which qualified him for a seat in the lower house of the South Carolina Assembly), although that wife died in childbirth in 1750. Rawlins Lowndes&#x27; second wife, Mary Cartwright Lowndes (1736–1770) bore seven children, including future Congressman Thomas Lowndes before her death. Like his elder half-sibling, William Lowndes received a classical education appropriate to his class in South Carolina and England, then studied law.

In 1802, William Lowndes married Elizabeth Pinckney (1781–1857), daughter of plantation owner and Federalist leader Thomas Pinckney, and they would have son Thomas Pinckney Lowndes (1808–1838) and daughter Rebecca Motte Lowndes Rutledge (1810–1892).

==Career==
Admitted to the bar in 1804, William Lowndes began his legal practice in Charleston. He also owned several rice plantations on South Carolina&#x27;s Atlantic coast, which he operated using enslaved labor.

==Politics==

William J. Lowndes first served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1804 to 1808.

Elected to the Twelfth United States Congress as a Representative from the Charleston area, Lowndes was a key member of the &#x27;War Hawk&#x27; faction along with Speaker of the House Henry Clay, future President of the Second Bank of the United States Langdon Cheves, Tennessee representative Felix Grundy, and future Vice President and South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. The War Hawks agitated throughout the Congressional session for declaration of the War of 1812, which they achieved on June 19. Lowndes roomed at the same boardinghouse as Calhoun in Washington, D.C., and they became close friends; Lowndes&#x27;s granddaughter, twenty years after his death, stated that Calhoun told his widow &quot;that there had never been a shadow between them.&quot;

After the war, Lowndes served as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for four years. He authored and shepherded through Congress the Tariff of 1816 in consultation with Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Dallas. He also rose to chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Treasury Department.
His reputation for financial expertise made Lowndes a chief lieutenant of Calhoun in authorizing the Second Bank of the United States during the Fourteenth Congress. Extremely well-respected by his colleagues and the press, Lowndes was offered several Cabinet positions by both James Madison and his successor James Monroe, including Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of War. When Lowndes refused the latter, it was offered to Calhoun, who accepted the position and held it until his inauguration as Vice President in 1825. According to historians Jeanne and David Heidler, &quot;Admired for his fairness and judicious temperament, Lowndes was frequently mentioned as presidential timber, especially because he seemed immune to ambition. Everybody listened when William Lowndes spoke because he always said something worth hearing.&quot;

Staying in the House, Lowndes was a major player in the negotiations surrounding what would become the Missouri Compromise; Southern support for the Compromise was at least partially due to Lowndes&#x27;s advocacy. William Lowndes also developed the Lowndes Apportionment Method, which would have given more power to smaller states, but could not secure its passage in Congress. In 1821, Lowndes was nominated for President of the United States for the 1824 election by the South Carolina legislature over the more ambitious Calhoun, which impeded Calhoun&#x27;s own incipient candidacy.

==Death and legacy==

Perennially ill after an accident in his youth, Lowndes&#x27; health took a serious downturn in 1822, and he resigned from Congress. At his wife&#x27;s urging, the Lowndes family embarked for a recuperative visit to England, but William died en route on October 27, 1822, at the age of 40. He was buried at sea, although a cenotaph in his honor stands at Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Following Lowndes&#x27; resignation, South Carolina Governor James Hamilton, Jr. replaced him in Congress. During the Nullification Crisis, Hamilton and John C. Calhoun had led the states&#x27; forces for Nullification in support of slavery. Lowndes&#x27;s most recent biographer considers the juxtaposition of these two figures and Lowndes&#x27;s position as one of the last Southern nationalists a &quot;transition of Southern politics.&quot;

In March–April 1824, electors from South Carolina honored William Lowndes posthumously with a single vote at the Democratic-Republican Party caucus, as the party&#x27;s candidate for the Office of U.S. Vice President for the upcoming election.

As shown by a historical marker, Lowndesville, South Carolina, was named in his honor. Lowndes County, Georgia, was named in his honor in 1825 and Alabama and Mississippi both named counties in his honor in 1830.

<text>The Montreal Exchange (MX; ), formerly the Montreal Stock Exchange (MSE), is a derivatives exchange, located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada that trades futures contracts and options on equities, indices, currencies, ETFs, energy and interest rates. Since 1965, it has been located in the Tour de la Bourse (Stock Exchange Tower), Montreal&#x27;s third-tallest building. It is owned by the Toronto-based TMX Group.

==History==
===Montreal Stock Exchange (1874-1982)===
The first exchange in Canada began in 1832 as an informal stock exchange at the Exchange Coffee House in Montreal. In 1874, Lorn MacDougall, along with his brothers Hartland St. Clair MacDougall and George Campbell MacDougall, James Burnett and Frank Bond were the driving force behind the creation of the Montreal Stock Exchange (a name that was used until 1982 when it became the Montreal Exchange). The shareholders voted Lorn MacDougall its first Chairman of the Governing Committee, a position he held until poor health forced him to retire in 1883.

By 1910, the number of trades amounted to about $2.1 million whereas the Toronto Stock Exchange only amounted to $900,000. The prosperity of the Montreal Stock Exchange led to the creation of major corporations like Dominion Textile and Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power.

At that time, many major financial institutions established their headquarters on and around Saint Jacques Street. In 1903, the same year as the construction of New York&#x27;s now famous Exchange Building, the Montreal Stock Exchange commissioned the same architect, George B. Post, to design its building on St. Francois-Xavier Street.

World War I marked the end of Canada&#x27;s dependence on London&#x27;s market. By contributing greatly to the war effort, Canada&#x27;s economy was greatly strengthened by the war. All through the 1920s, Montreal&#x27;s market experienced strong growth, reaching $3.5 million.
In 1926, the &quot;Montreal Curb Market&quot; was created to allow trading in speculative and junior stocks. If successfully grown, they could apply for a transfer to the main Exchange. In 1953, the Curb Market was renamed the Canadian Stock Exchange.

The 1929 crisis hit Montreal especially hard. In 1934, due to multiple factors, the Toronto Stock Exchange surpassed Montreal. Still, Montreal&#x27;s position in Canada&#x27;s economy recovered, and it was not until the mid-1970s that Toronto became the metropolis of Canada after a decade of political troubles in Montreal.

===Decline===
For the separatist group Front de libération du Québec, the Montreal Stock Exchange represented a bastion of Anglo-Canadian power. On February 13, 1969, they detonated a bomb at the Stock Exchange that blew out the northeast wall and injured 27 people.

===Montreal Exchange (1982–present)===
In 1982, the Montreal Stock Exchange changed its name to the Montreal Exchange to reflect the growing importance of financial instruments other than stocks–primarily options and futures–on its trading floor.

In 1999, the Vancouver, Alberta, Toronto and Montreal exchanges agreed to restructure the Canadian capital markets along the lines of market specialization, resulting in the Montreal Exchange assuming the position of Canadian Derivatives Exchange for the following 10 years. Trading in the shares of large companies was transferred to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), and in the trading of smaller companies to the new Canadian Venture Exchange (now: TSX Venture Exchange). This change, which reflected the economic reality that most equity trading had moved to the TSE, caused consternation among those in favour of political independence for the province of Quebec.

At the end of 2001, the Exchange had completed its migration from an open outcry environment to a fully automated trading system, becoming the first traditional exchange in North America to complete this transformation. In the process, it modified the market model for trading, from a traditional specialist model to a competing market making model for the equity option market.

In February 2004, the Exchange became the sole provider of electronic trading systems and support for the Boston Options Exchange (BOX), making it the first foreign exchange to be responsible for the day-to-day technical operations of an American exchange using the Sola Trading electronic platform. That contract now provides the Montreal Exchange with a significant part of its revenue. The Montreal Exchange has a 31.4% stake in the Boston Option Exchange (BOX), percentage that has since risen to over 51% (as of September 2009).

On December 10, 2007, TSX Group announced that it had acquired Montreal Exchange Inc. for C$1.31 Billion. The acquisition was completed on 1 May 2008 and the corporation subsequently was renamed TMX Group Inc.

On February 9, 2011, the London Stock Exchange announced that they had agreed to merge with the TMX Group, Montreal Exchange&#x27;s parent, hoping to create a combined entity with a market capitalization of $5.9 billion (£3.7 billion). Xavier Rolet, who currently is CEO of the LSE Group, would head the new enlarged company, while TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet would become the new firm president. Based on data from December 30, 2010 the new stock exchange would be the second largest in the world with a market cap 48% greater than the Nasdaq. Eight of the fifteen board members of the combined entity will be nominated by LSE and seven by TMX. The provisional name for the combined group would be LTMX Group plc.

On June 13, 2011, a rival, and hostile bid from the &quot;Maple Group&quot; of Canadian interests, was unveiled. A cash and stock bid of $3.7 billion CAD, in hopes of blocking the LSE Group&#x27;s takeover of TMX. The group is composed of the leading banks and financial institutions of Canada.

==Montreal Curb Market/Canadian Stock Exchange==

The Montreal Curb Market was a stock exchange created in 1926 for trading in stocks that were considered to be too speculative or junior to be traded on the Montreal Stock Exchange (MSE). As these companies matured, trading in their shares was transferred to the MSE.

In 1953, the Montreal Curb Market changed its name to Canadian Stock Exchange. In 1974, the Canadian Stock Exchange merged with the Montreal Stock Exchange, retaining the larger exchange&#x27;s name.

On November 29, 1999, the small-cap portion of the equities market of the Montreal Exchange was merged into the Canadian Venture Exchange (CDNX), along with the Alberta Stock Exchange (ASE) and the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE). The Canadian Dealing Network and Winnipeg Stock Exchange also merged with CDNX. The Canadian Venture Exchange is today known as the TSX Venture Exchange and is based in Calgary, although still has offices in Montreal.

==Montreal Climate Exchange==
The Montreal Climate Exchange or &quot;MCeX&quot; was started as a joint venture between the Montreal Exchange and the now-defunct Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). It trades futures contracts on greenhouse gases. Established on July 12, 2006, and launched on May 30, 2008, MCeX is the first regulated environmental market in Canada.

===Background===
As part of the 2008 federal climate plan, in addition to internal reductions, large regulated industrial emitters in Canada are able to choose to buy emission units on the domestic carbon market. Regulated emitters’ credits are issued by government authorities at the end of a compliance year to regulated emitters that reduce the intensity of their GHG emissions below the target established by the federal government. These emitters are able to sell their credits on the market or keep them for subsequent compliance years. Futures contracts sold on the MCeX are equal to 100 Canada carbon dioxide equivalent units (one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent).

===Timeline===
*On July 12, 2006, the Montréal Climate Exchange was established as a partnership between the MX and the CCX. The two exchanges finalized the preliminary agreement announced in Montreal on December 7, 2005, during the first meeting of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
*On October 2, 2006, the exchange said the federal government appeared to be moving in the right direction on emissions regulation.
*On October 23, 2006, the exchange promoted a market-based solution to help meet environmental challenges.
*On May 10, 2007, the MX filed for regulatory approval of market rules for trading of MCeX environmental products.
*On July 25, 2007, the Montreal Climate Exchange announced its carbon futures contract would be launched by year end.
*On March 14, 2008, the Montreal Climate Exchange announced plans to launch trading of futures contracts on Canada carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units on May 30, 2008, subject to regulatory approval.

<doc id="694726" wikidata="Q5631958" url="?curid=694726" title="HMS Conway (school ship)">
<text>HMS &quot;Conway&quot; was a naval training school or &quot;school ship&quot;, founded in 1859 and housed for most of her life aboard a 19th-century wooden ship of the line. The ship was originally stationed on the Mersey near Liverpool, then moved to the Menai Strait during World War II. While being towed back to Birkenhead for a refit in 1953, she ran aground and was wrecked, and later burned. The school moved to purpose-built premises on Anglesey where it continued for another twenty years.

== Origins ==
In the mid-19th century, the demand for a reliable standard of merchant navy officers had grown to the point where ship owners decided to set up an organisation to train, and indeed educate, them properly—the Mercantile Marine Service Association.

One of the first sites chosen for a school ship was Liverpool, in 1857. The ship they chose to accommodate the school, to be provided by the Admiralty and moored in the Sloyne, off Rock Ferry on the River Mersey, was the corvette HMS &quot;Conway&quot;. There were to be three &quot;Conway&quot;s over the years, the name being transferred to the new ship each time it was replaced. In 1861 HMS &quot;Winchester&quot; took the name, but the one that housed the school for most of its life was lent by the Royal Navy to the Mercantile Marine Service Association in 1875. This was the two-decker , a 92-gun second-rate line-of-battle ship. She was 205 ft (62.5 m) long on the gundeck, 54 ft (16 m) in beam, and displaced 4,375 long tons. During her operational life she was equipped with ten 8-inch (200 mm) guns and eighty-two 30-pounders. Launched in June 1839, she was entirely built from West African hardwoods and copper fastened, with copper sheathing anti-fouling to her under parts. She had survived the Baltic Blockade during the Crimean War, later protecting British possessions in the Caribbean and &#x27;showing the flag&#x27; along the eastern seaboard of North America 50 years after the British surrender at Yorktown. In 1876 she was renamed &quot;Conway&quot; and moored on the Mersey.

The ship, already a century old, was refitted in the dry dock at Birkenhead between 1936 and 1938. She was also fitted with a new figurehead representing Nelson, which was ceremonially unveiled by the then Poet Laureate John Masefield, an alumnus of the school (1891–1893).

By 1953 she had already outlived both her sisters, &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;London&quot;, by more than 70 years.

== From Mersey to Menai ==
In 1941, with air raids on the Liverpool docks taking place, &quot;Conway&quot; had already survived several near misses. It was decided to move the ship from the Mersey to Anglesey, where she remained moored for the duration of the war between the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Glyn Garth and the Gazelle Hotel, in line with the Catalina flying boat moorings along the Anglesey shore. This being wartime there was no official announcement of the move and local residents were startled one evening to see a picturesque Nelson-era ship of the line, a &quot;wooden wall&quot;, entering the Menai Strait. Subsequently, ship-to-shore traffic was across the Menai Strait to the pier-head at Bangor or to the Gazelle Hotel ferry terminal and she became something of a local tourist attraction.

At the end of the 1940s there was a surge in demand for merchant navy cadets. The ship did not have space for more cadets so the ship&#x27;s superintendent, Captain Goddard, started looking for space ashore with playing fields and a shore establishment. He picked on Plas Newydd, the stately home of the Marquess of Anglesey, a large part of which had been vacated by the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps at the end of the War. This site seemed ideal, except that the seabed provided very poor anchorage, so four five-ton anchors were sunk there. Only one problem remained: could the ship be moved there in one piece? She would need to be towed by tugs through a stretch of water between Anglesey and the mainland, known as the &quot;Swellies&quot;. This area, bounded by the two Menai bridges (the Menai Suspension Bridge and Britannia Bridge), is notorious for underwater shoals and dangerous, complex tidal streams as well as a non-tidal current varied by the wind and atmospheric pressure. Captain Goddard was proud of his experience as a hydrographic surveyor, and having studied the problem, believed it was possible.

After a false start the day before, the ship was moved successfully on 13 April 1949, in spite of what was obviously a great risk. &quot;Conway&quot; remains by far the deepest ship ever to have passed through the Swellies. Her draft was aft and the underwater clearances were marginal. The overhead clearance under Menai Suspension Bridge, which is above high water, was estimated to be three feet, all depending upon the actual height of the tide at the time of passing through. &quot;I was glad when it was accomplished,&quot; Captain Goddard wrote. &quot;It created a great deal of interest amongst the North Wales seafaring fraternity who had declared the undertaking to be a foolish one.&quot;

== Loss of the ship ==

By 1953 another refit was due. This could not be done locally so the ship had to be taken back to Birkenhead dry dock, passing back through the Swellies once more. The operation took place on 14 April 1953. There were the same two Liverpool tugs which had shifted her several times before, &quot;Dongarth&quot; forward and &quot;Minegarth&quot; aft. The new Captain Superintendent, Captain E Hewitt, was in command, with two Trinity House local pilots – Mr R D Jones (junior) aboard the head tug, and Mr R J Jones (senior) – advising Captain Hewitt, and the Blue Funnel Liverpool pilot Mr James Miller overseeing the towage.

High water at Liverpool that morning was 11:18, at a height of 32&#x27;10&quot; and was the highest tide that year. &quot;Laver&#x27;s Almanac&quot; quotes high water at Menai Bridge as 28 minutes before high water Liverpool. What is termed &#x27;slack&#x27; in the Swellies is actually a brief period of uneasy equilibrium between two opposing flood streams which typically occurs 1 hour 42 minutes before local high water, or at 09:08 on the morning of the move. Owing to the strength of the southwest-going ebb, which runs at 8 knots during a spring tide, there is a confused complex tidal flow among the numerous rocks and islets generating many powerful eddies. On a big tide in particular it is vital for an outbound vessel to be through the Swellies before the tide turns against her. It is therefore the local practice to start an outward transit with the last of the northeast-going flood 20 minutes before the &#x27;slack&#x27;, or at 08:48 on the morning of the move. Captain Hewitt had worked with the Caernarfon harbour master, Captain Rees Thomas, in preparing his plan, and had several times made a passage of the Swellies in the &quot;Conway&quot;″s motor boat, checking his timings at . He also consulted &quot;Conway&quot;″s old log book for the timings of the previous transit, and had planned to arrive at the bridge at 09:20.

The streams in the Menai Strait are affected by winds outside in the Irish Sea. With a strong north or north-westerly wind both the rate and duration of the southwest-going ebb are increased, and the southwest-going ebb may begin quarter of an hour earlier. The 0600 synoptic chart showed a stationary deep depression west of Norway with a secondary low in the North Sea, and a high steadily closing the west coast of Ireland, which could be expected to result in an increasingly strong northwesterly wind in the Irish Sea. But in the shelter of the Plas Newydd mooring, there was no indication of this. At 0800 as the wind was being recorded in Conway&#x27;s logbook as northerly force 1–2 (2 to 5 knots), only 13 miles away on station off Point Lynas it was being recorded by the Liverpool pilot boat as northwesterly force 6 (22–27 knots) and her noon entry was NW force 7, (28–33 knots) while during the morning Bidston Observatory was recording gusts up to 49 knots (storm force 10).

The Investigating Subcommittee was later to express its surprise that Captain Hewitt had left the Plas Newydd mooring without a weather forecast, and &quot;had no knowledge of the stormy conditions prevailing at sea at the time Conway was to make the passage&quot; since it was local knowledge that in such weather &quot;abnormal conditions might be encountered.&quot; In addition to the tide-generated streams in the Menai Strait there is also a non-tidal current, the Southwest Residual, a dynamic reaction which directly reflects wind stress in the Irish Sea. The north-westerly mean wind speed of 16 meters per second at sea that day would enhance the Residual by 15 cm per second, increasing the strength of the southwest-going ebb at Plas Newydd by as much as 3 knots.

Conway&#x27;s logbook shows she left the mooring at 0822 and arrived at Britannia Bridge at 0850, which was the locally recommended time for starting the outward transit and Jones the pilot naturally advised keeping her going with the last of the northeast-going flood tide behind her. Instead Captain Hewitt had the ship brought up for half an hour to wait until 0920. The severe wind in the Irish Sea caused the stream in the Strait to turn to the westward earlier which eliminated the brief slack water period. Captain F J Durrant, marine manager of the towing company, observed &quot;The anticipated ten minute slack water did not materialise. The ebb set in immediately the flood ended at 0920.&quot; With the ship far too late and sensitive to the adverse conditions the pilot advised going back. Captain Hewitt passed the ship under Britannia Bridge at 0923 even though the ebb tide was already setting against him.

Only 17 minutes later, &quot;At 0940 ... the forward tug &quot;Dongarth&quot; was towing at full speed against the tide but making no further progress.&quot; By 10:10, 47 minutes after passing under the bridge, the tow was still in much the same position having made good only six tenths of a mile from the bridge, giving the tide another half an hour to develop further, yet it was not until then that Captain Hewitt had the stern tug slipped and sent forward to assist the head tug, when &quot;headway became slight but noticeable.&quot; By 1020, already a full hour into the ebb, the pilots had worked the ship across the tide and into the eddy which the &quot;Admiralty Sailing Directions&quot; states forms near the Anglesey shore close westward of the northern pier of the Suspension Bridge, and intended holding her there in the safety of this until the strength of the tide had abated. Instead, with only to go to the bridge, Captain Hewitt ordered that the ship be put back in the channel and this was done. Almost immediately, at 1030, she was caught by an eddy of overwhelming strength which drove the ship ashore over The Platters. &quot;This disastrous sheer occurred and was concluded in a matter of seconds.&quot; Contrasting with the 18 minutes she had taken to complete the inbound transit, the outbound ship had been 1 hour 7 minutes covering the 1200 yards from Britannia Bridge where the pilot had advised going back.

After both tugs on full speed for ten minutes had failed to make any impression they were instructed to stand by at Menai Bridge Pier for another attempt to re-float her on the evening tide when there would be a better opportunity if the weather at sea moderated. A third tug, &quot;Grassgarth&quot;, sent out at 1430 to assist in towing her off was forced to put back to Liverpool through stress of weather.
While her forepart planted firmly on the shelving shore her stern was floating in 30 feet of water. As the tide fell the stern lost its support causing the ship to become severely hogged. Her seams opened, and about her midship sections the height between decks was reduced from over 6 feet (1.8 m) to less than 4 feet (1.2 m). &quot;Conditions on board were very bad with the after end of the ship from the mainmast sagging downwards, and the continuous sound of cracking, twisting, rending timber and rushing water below.&quot; When the next tide made the stern failed to lift and the ship flooded freely through her open seams. Being evident that further attempts to tow the ship off would be to no purpose, the tugs were discharged and left for Liverpool the following morning. Two days after the grounding, in the evening of 16 April 1953, surveyors declared &quot;Conway&quot; a total constructive loss. The ship was not insured.

== Last years of the school ==

The school was first rehoused in tents loaned by the British Army pitched in the grounds of Plas Newydd, the seat of the Marquess of Anglesey, overlooking the Menai Strait. These were quickly replaced by &#x27;The Camp&#x27;, temporary hutted accommodation in addition to parts of the Marquess&#x27;s house already in use as a supplement to the ship&#x27;s limited space. All traces of the huts have now gone but present-day visitors to Plas Newydd use the National Trust cafe that was the school&#x27;s canteen. During the 1960s permanent premises were built in the grounds of Plas Newydd, where &quot;Conway&quot;&#x27;s last ten years passed in what is known in naval parlance as a &quot;stone frigate&quot;.

The school closed in 1974 after funding from the Government through Cheshire County Council ceased. The buildings now house the Conway Centre, a residential arts and outdoor education centre.

<doc id="694732" wikidata="Q1235791" url="?curid=694732" title="Dollo's law of irreversibility">
<text>Dollo&#x27;s law of irreversibility (also known as Dollo&#x27;s law and Dollo&#x27;s principle), proposed in 1893 by Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo states that, &quot;an organism never returns exactly to a former state, even if it finds itself placed in conditions of existence identical to those in which it has previously lived ... it always keeps some trace of the intermediate stages through which it has passed.&quot;

The statement is often misinterpreted as claiming that evolution is not reversible, or that lost structures and organs cannot reappear in the same form by any process of devolution. According to Richard Dawkins, the law is &quot;really just a statement about the statistical improbability of following exactly the same evolutionary trajectory twice (or, indeed, any particular trajectory), in either direction&quot;. Stephen Jay Gould suggested that irreversibility forecloses certain evolutionary pathways once broad forms have emerged: &quot;[For example], once you adopt the ordinary body plan of a reptile, hundreds of options are forever closed, and future possibilities must unfold within the limits of inherited design.&quot;

This principle is classically applied to morphology, particularly of fossils, but may also be used to describe molecular events, such as individual mutations or gene losses.

==Use in phylogenetics==
In maximum parsimony, Dollo parsimony refers to a model whereby a characteristic is gained only one time and can never be regained if it is lost. For example, the evolution and repeated loss of teeth in vertebrates could be well-modeled under Dollo parsimony, whereby teeth made from hydroxyapatite evolved only once at the origin of vertebrates, and were then lost multiple times, in birds, turtles, and seahorses, among others.

This also applies to molecular characters, such as losses or inactivation of individual genes themselves. The loss of gulonolactone oxidase, the final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of vitamin C, is responsible for the dietary requirement of vitamin C in humans, as well as many other animals.

==A molecular example==

A 2009 study on the evolution of protein structure proposed a new mechanism for Dollo&#x27;s law. It examined a hormone receptor that had evolved from an ancestral protein that was able to bind two hormones to a new protein that was specific for a single hormone. This change was produced by two amino acid substitutions, which prevent binding of the second hormone. However, several other changes subsequently occurred, which were selectively neutral as they did not affect hormone binding. When the authors tried to revert the protein back to its ancestral state by mutating the two &quot;binding residues&quot;, they found the other changes had destabilised the ancestral state of the protein. They concluded that in order for this protein to evolve in reverse and regain its ability to bind two hormones, several independent neutral mutations would have to occur purely by chance with no selection pressure. As this is extremely unlikely, it may explain why evolution tends to run in one direction.

==Proposed exceptions==

Although the exact threshold for violations of Dollo&#x27;s law is unclear, there are several case studies whose results dispute the validity of some interpretations. For example, many taxa of gastropods have reduced shells, and some have lost coiling of their shell altogether. In Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s interpretation of Dollo&#x27;s law, it would not be possible to regain a coiled shell after the coiling has been lost. Nevertheless, a few genera in the slipper snail family (Calyptraeidae) may have changed their developmental timing (heterochrony) and regained a coiled shell from a limpet-like shell. Frietson Galis observed that many of these studies are based on either molecular phylogenies or morphological cladistic analyses that are tenuous and subject to change.

Other proposed &#x27;exceptions&#x27; include the ocelli and wings of stick insects, the larval stages of salamanders, lost toes and re-evolution of oviparity in lizards, lost lower teeth in frogs, clavicles in non-avian theropod dinosaurs, and neck, pectoral region, and upper limb musculature in primates, including the lineage leading to humans.

<doc id="694740" wikidata="Q981167" url="?curid=694740" title="Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)">
<text>Christopher Henry Smith (born March 4, 1953) is an American politician serving his 23rd term as the U.S. representative for . Though it has taken various forms, his district has always been situated in central New Jersey. Currently, the district contains parts of Ocean and Monmouth counties. Smith is a member of the Republican Party, having switched from the Democratic Party in 1978.

Smith is the dean of New Jersey&#x27;s congressional delegation and the longest-serving member of Congress in New Jersey&#x27;s history. He has focused much of his career on promoting human rights abroad, including authoring the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 and several follow-on laws. From 1993 to 2019, he was the top House Republican on the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He has used his leadership positions, including chairmanships, to author multiple pieces of legislation focused on human rights and conduct aggressive oversight of human rights abuses, actions that have earned him scorn from abusing nations.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Smith was born in Rahway, New Jersey, on March 4, 1953. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Perth Amboy, where he competed as a runner and wrestler.

After graduating with a B.A. in business administration from Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey), Smith worked in his family&#x27;s sporting goods business. In the 1976 election cycle, he managed the Democratic primary challenge of Steven Foley, an attorney and anti-abortion activist, against incumbent Senator Harrison A. Williams; Foley received about 15% of the vote, losing to Williams. In 1978, Smith switched to the Republican Party, and became executive director of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee, a part-time role.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====1978====
In 1978, while working at his family&#x27;s sporting goods store, 25-year-old Smith ran for Congress as a Republican. He lost to longtime Democratic incumbent U.S. Congressman Frank Thompson 61%–37%.

====1980====
In 1980, Smith ran against Thompson again. Initially, Smith was thought to have a very slim chance of winning, but Thompson was indicted as part of the FBI&#x27;s Abscam probe. With the race now considered competitive, Republicans considered replacing Smith, but two alternative candidates seen as more competitive, Hamilton mayor John K. Rafferty and 1978 Senate nominee Jeff Bell, declined. Helped by Ronald Reagan&#x27;s strong performance in the district, Smith defeated Thompson 57%–41%.

====1982====
In 1982, Smith&#x27;s district was redrawn to include more Democratic voters and his Democratic opponent was former New Jersey Senate President Joseph P. Merlino, who had directly controlled the redistricting process and run a competitive campaign for governor the year before. It was widely assumed that Smith&#x27;s 1980 victory over the scandal-plagued Thompson was a fluke, and that he would lose to the better-known Merlino. At the end of one of their debates, Smith approached Merlino to exchange pleasantries. Merlino was quoted as saying &quot;Beat it, kid.&quot;

During the campaign, Merlino ran a negative ad comparing Smith to Jimmy Stewart&#x27;s character in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. In response, Stewart released a statement endorsing Smith and denouncing the ad: &quot;When I played Mr. Smith in that picture, I did not think he was a naive hick. I thought he believed in honesty and integrity in government, the right of the people and the love of his country.&quot; Merlino pulled the ad.

Smith won the race with 52.7% of the vote.

Subsequently, a federal court found the 1982 redistricting was impermissible gerrymandering, and Smith&#x27;s district was redrawn to more closely resemble the one used in 1980. He has not faced another contest that close since.

====1984–present====
From 1984 to 2016, Smith won reelection with over 60% of the vote.

In 2006, Smith&#x27;s 66% was the highest percentage for any Republican in the New Jersey delegation.

In 2008, Smith defeated college history professor Joshua M. Zeitz, 66%–32%.
In 2010, Smith received 69.4% of the vote, ahead of Democratic nominee Howard Kleinhendler, Libertarian nominee Joe Siano, Green Party nominee Steven Welzer, and American Renaissance Movement nominee David Meiswinkle.

In 2018, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Joshua Welle with 55% of the vote to Welle&#x27;s 43%. Smith was the only Republican to win a congressional race in New Jersey that year, reducing the GOP to its smallest presence in New Jersey&#x27;s House delegation since 1918. This was Smith&#x27;s closest election since 1982.

In 2020, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Stephanie Schmid.

In 2022, Smith defeated Democratic nominee Matthew Jenkins with 66.9% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Smith was ranked the 17th most bipartisan member of the House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the second most bipartisan from New Jersey) in the Bipartisan Index by the Lugar Center.

In November 1997, Smith was one of 18 House Republicans to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. That scandal led to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Smith voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, he voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).

It was revealed in October 2015 that intern applicants for Smith&#x27;s office were required to rate &quot;27 different personalities, organizations, and political issues, to indicate whether they tend to agree with them, disagree with them, or have no opinion or knowledge of them&quot;. Personalities and organizations included Rachel Maddow, the Pope, Planned Parenthood, and The National Right to Life Committee.

Smith has been nominated, and confirmed, twice to serve as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. He was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2015 for the 70th session and by President Donald Trump in 2017 for the 72nd session.

Smith voted against both articles in the first impeachment of Donald Trump, and the sole article of the second impeachment of Donald Trump.

Smith did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. Smith voted to certify both Arizona&#x27;s and Pennsylvania&#x27;s results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.

On February 4, 2021, Smith voted with 10 other House Republicans and all House Democrats to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments, in response to controversial political statements she had made. On November 5, 2021, Smith was one of 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

;Veterans
In January 2001, Smith became chairman of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, and pushed for policies Republican leadership opposed, including voting against the Republican, and for the Democratic, budget resolution, because the latter included more spending on veterans programs. In 2004, Smith refused to endorse the Republican budget proposal, unless it included more money for veterans. In a congressional hearing, Smith articulated his belief that the Bush Administration&#x27;s budget request was $1.2 billion less than the Department of Veterans Affairs actually required, embarrassing the administration and Republican congressional leadership. During his four years as committee chair, Smith wrote 22 bills addressing veterans&#x27; issues. His unwillingness to follow the party line resulted in the House Republican Caucus removing him from his chairmanship (and from the committee altogether) in January 2005, at the beginning of the 109th Congress, with the chairmanship going to Steve Buyer instead, two years short of the normal six-year term. Veterans&#x27; groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Paralyzed Veterans of America praised Smith and criticized the decision to remove him.

====Legislation====

On May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill International Megan&#x27;s Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress), which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a sex offender of children travels to their country.

As of April 2020, FiveThirtyEight reported that Smith voted in line with Trump&#x27;s position 67.7% of the time, the third-lowest percentage among Republican members of Congress after fellow New Jerseyan Jeff Van Drew and Brian Fitzpatrick.

In March 2021, Smith was one of eight Republicans to join the House majority in passing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.

== Political positions ==

===Abortion===
Smith is strongly anti-abortion. He is a co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, and served as co-chair of the Trump Administration&#x27;s Pro-Life Coalition. He supports the Mexico City policy, which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals, advocate to decriminalize abortion or expand abortion services. In 2000, he voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2000. In December 2023, Smith signed a letter of support to Tommy Tuberville, thanking him for his nine-month hold on more than 400 military promotions over the Pentagon&#x27;s abortion policy.

Smith expressed support for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.

Smith has introduced various forms of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, starting with the original proposal in 2011. The 2011 proposal prohibited federal funds from being used for health benefits that cover abortion, unless in the case of rape, incest or if the woman could die. It also disqualified abortions from being written off on taxes. In 2013, Smith reintroduced the proposal, which further restricted insurance coverage of abortions. The bill passed the House but has yet to be voted on by the Senate.

===Domestic violence===
Smith voted for the original 1994 Violence Against Women Act, and co-sponsored the reauthorization bills of 2000 and 2005, the latter of which provided $1.6 billion for investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. Smith voted against reauthorizing the act in 2013, due to the Senate version of the bill&#x27;s cutting of funding for the Trafficking in Persons Office at the State Department, which Smith&#x27;s Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 created.

=== Environment ===
As of 2020, Smith has a lifetime score of 62% on the National Environmental Scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters, the second-highest of any sitting Republican member (after Brian Fitzpatrick). He has said, &quot;Climate change is a global challenge that must be addressed with a global solution.&quot;

Smith also opposes offshore drilling, particularly in New Jersey.

Smith backed a carbon emissions trading bill to tackle climate change, one of only eight Republicans in the House to do so.

===Guns===
Smith opposes concealed carry. In 2016, he was one of four Republicans to receive a 100% rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and has generally received low or intermediate ratings from pro-gun organizations Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association. Smith did not co-sponsor the Brady Campaign&#x27;s proposed legislation to expand background checks for gun purchasers.

Smith was one of five Republicans to co-sponsor HR 8 in the 116th Congress, which would require mandatory background checks for gun sales.

Smith called the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting &quot;tragic beyond words&quot;, and said, &quot;The terrorist&#x27;s motive, if linked to radical Islamist ideology, underscores the escalating national and worldwide threat from global jihad.&quot;

In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Smith co-sponsored a ban on bump stocks with Leonard Lance.

===Health care===
Smith has written three major laws to address autism, including the most recent Autism CARES which included $1.3 billion in funding for research, services and supports and requires a report on aging out.

On May 9, 2014, Smith introduced the bill Autism CARES Act of 2014, a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to autism spectrum disorders (autism) conducted by various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

On May 9, 2019, Smith was one of only three Republicans who voted for HR 986, a measure supported by all voting House Democrats intended to maintain protections of those with preexisting medical conditions to have continued access to affordable medical insurance under the existing provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Five weeks earlier, he had voted with seven other Republicans to pass a resolution condemning the Trump administration&#x27;s efforts by Department of Justice to have the courts invalidate Obamacare.

Smith has been a longtime promoter of the medically unrecognized &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot;, and has pushed for the medical establishment to recognize the condition. The condition, not to be confused with genuine Lyme disease, is generally rejected by medical professionals, and its promotion is generally seen as health fraud. In 2019, Smith proposed an investigation into whether the Pentagon had released &quot;weaponized&quot; ticks infected with Lyme disease into the environment between 1950 and 1975. Scientists identified this proposal, which Congress did not adopt, as based on a conspiracy theory and claimed that an investigation was unnecessary and a poor use of funds.

===Human rights===

Smith advocates for human rights, serving on numerous committees that seek to impact both national and international laws and legislation. He has stated that the bills he introduces to the house are meant to make the U.S. take &quot;human rights seriously&quot;.

In 1999, Smith proposed, as part of the American Embassy Security Act, to stop a U.S. sponsored program which provided training to Royal Ulster Constabulary with the FBI, due to claims of human rights violations, i. e., harassment of defense attorneys representing republicans in Northern Ireland. However, he voted &quot;no&quot; on a bill that halts arms sales to Saudi Arabia and removes troops from Yemen.

He supported the return David Goldman&#x27;s son in the Goldman child abduction case, which involved a trip to Brazil. Smith acknowledges the Armenian genocide, and has made calls for the U.S. to recognize it.

In 2017, Smith co-sponsored an effort to prioritize human rights in Azerbaijan with Jim McGovern. The H. Res. 537 act also seeks to see further implementation of the Magnitsky Act regarding Azerbaijani officials, as well as a call for Azerbaijan to release all political prisoners. He supported efforts to deport Jakiw Palij, a denaturalized former American citizen residing in New York who failed to disclose he worked as a guard at a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. Palij was deported to Germany in 2018 and died in 2019. Smith condemned Turkey&#x27;s wide-ranging crackdown on dissent following a failed July 2016 coup.

====China====
Smith has held congressional hearings and has proposed bills regarding human rights violations, specifically around women&#x27;s sexual health, activism and religious groups, in China. He staunchly opposes the forced sterilization and forced abortions being implemented by the Chinese government towards women regarding China&#x27;s one-child policy. Regarding the victimization of these women, Smith stated that &quot;the agony that those women carry with them is beyond words. They talk about the pain that they carry for their child and for the violation by the state.&quot; In response, Smith wrote a bill, which was put into law in 1999, making it illegal for the U.S. to issue visas to foreign nationals who have been involved in forced abortion or sterilization.
Smith held a congressional hearing regarding the disappearance of blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng. He attempted, in 2011, to visit Chen in China, when the activist was under house arrest, but was not granted permission. In response to the violations towards Chen and his family, Smith sponsored the China Democracy Promotion Act of 2011, which sought to prevent known Chinese human rights violators from entering the U.S.

In the wake of the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement, Smith co-sponsored the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, supporting Hong Kong&#x27;s ongoing autonomy and the human rights of those Hong Kongers involved in nonviolent protests and/or those who have had their rights violated by the Chinese government.

In November 2018, Smith raised the issue of Xinjiang internment camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghurs. Smith said: &quot;The internment of over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims in China is a staggering evil and should be treated by the international community as a crime against humanity. The Chinese government&#x27;s creation of a vast system of what can only be called concentration camps cannot be tolerated in the 21st century.&quot;

On July 13, 2020, Smith, along with three other U.S. politicians, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for &quot;interfering in China’s internal affairs&quot; through their condemnation of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. On August 10, 2020, Smith, along with 10 other U.S. individuals, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for &quot;behaving badly on Hong Kong-related issues&quot;.

In October 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Smith criticized some US-based financial executives attending the Global Financial Leaders&#x27; Investment Summit, saying that companies &quot;that trumpet their so-called &#x27;Environmental, Social and Governance Principles&#x27; at home are quick to discard these &#x27;values&#x27; for a chance to make a profit from China.&quot;

====South Korea====
Smith has indicated his serious concern on the amendment of the Development of Inter-Korean Relations Act in South Korea which passed the South Korean National Assembly on December 14, 2020. It penalizes activists who send anti-North Korean material across the border as balloon propaganda. It was passed by the super-majority of the ruling party of President Moon Jae-in who is keen to improve cross-border ties. Smith stated that &quot;While I would hope that members of Korea&#x27;s Democratic Party would see how damaging this proposed legislation is to democratic principles and human rights, and thus reverse course, in the event that they pass such a law, I call upon our State Department to critically reevaluate the Republic of Korea&#x27;s commitment to democratic values in its annual human rights report, as well as in its report on international religious freedom. It may very well be that we will see South Korea put on a watch list, which would be a very sad development indeed.&quot;

====Religion====
Smith supports religious rights regarding international human rights. He supports sanctions against Vietnam regarding its treatment of Catholics and China regarding the Uyghurs and Falun Gong.

===Immigration===
Smith supported the Indonesian Family Refugee Protection Act in 2012, which would have extended the deadline for Indonesian immigrants to file for citizenship.

===Intellectual property rights===
Smith authored the Global Online Freedom Act in 2007, but it did not become law. The proposed legislation was a bill &quot;to promote freedom of expression on the Internet, to protect United States businesses from coercion to participate in repression by authoritarian foreign governments, and for other purposes.&quot; Specifically, the bill would prohibit American companies from turning over data about customers residing in &quot;internet restrictive countries.&quot; The bill is supported by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders. It is opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

===January 6 commission===
On May 19, 2021, Smith was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the U.S. Capitol attack.

===LGBT rights===
In 2015, Smith said he did not consider same-sex marriage a fundamental human right as defined by the United Nations.

In July 2022, Smith voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that required the U.S. federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages.

=== Labor movement ===
Smith supports the Employee Free Choice Act. The AFL-CIO Legislative Scorecard, which tracks support for workers&#x27; rights, gives Smith a 61% lifetime rating, ranking him seventh of New Jersey&#x27;s twelve Representatives, and 195th of the House&#x27;s 435 Representatives.

The AFL-CIO endorsed Smith for re-election in 2018, calling him one of the &quot;best candidates for working people,&quot; due to his support for collective bargaining, opposition to the Janus v. AFSCME Supreme Court decision, and support for infrastructure funding, among other reasons.

As of March 2019, Smith is the only Republican co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act. He also supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which expanded the scope of the statute of limitations for pay discrimination.

Smith cited the example of Lech Wałęsa and the Solidarity movement as a reason he support unions. He also said of his fellow Republicans, &quot;What my Republican colleagues often don&#x27;t understand is that labor is a human-rights issue&quot;.

=== Marijuana ===
Smith has a &quot;D&quot; rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He has consistently voted against the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which provides veterans access to information regarding medical marijuana accessibility in their respective states.

===Veterans affairs===
Bob Wallace, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars calls Smith &quot;the best friend&quot; of veterans. In 2004, Smith refused to endorse the Republican budget proposal unless it included more money for veterans. In a congressional hearing, Smith publicly articulated his belief that the Bush Administration&#x27;s budget request was $1.2 billion less than the Department of Veterans Affairs actually required, embarrassing the administration and Republican congressional leadership. In 2005, Smith was removed from his chairmanship and membership on the Veterans Affair Committee for his aggressive role in seeking more funding for veteran-related causes.

===Science policy===
Smith supports efforts to provide alternatives to embryonic stem cell research. In 2005, he co-sponsored a bill with Artur Davis to fund the creation of a network of national blood banks to distribute umbilical cord blood for stem cell research.

===Taxation===
Smith voted against the 2017 Republican tax legislation backed by Donald Trump; he was one of five Republican representatives from New Jersey who joined Democrats in opposing the bill. Smith opposed the bill as &quot;unfair to the taxpayers of New Jersey&quot; because it dramatically limited the federal reduction of state and local taxes (SALT). and said he would be &quot;forced to oppose&quot; more tax cuts if legislation included a provision permanently extending the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction.

<doc id="694751" wikidata="Q7098980" url="?curid=694751" title="Optimum sustainable yield">
<text>In population ecology and economics, optimum sustainable yield is the level of effort (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being used. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.

In environmental science, optimum sustainable yield is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield, and enables an ecosystem to have a high aesthetic value. This concept is widely used specifically in the management of fisheries, where surplus fish are removed so the population stays at its carrying capacity. This allows the most fish to be harvested while still maintaining maximum population growth.

<text>Sanford &#x27;Spamford&#x27; Wallace (born c. 1968) is an Internet spammer. He initially sent junk faxes before coming to notoriety in 1997, promoting himself as the original &quot;Spam King&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s prolific spamming has resulted in encounters with the United States government, anti-spam activists, and large corporations such as Facebook and MySpace.

==Early career==
In the late 1990s, his company, Cyber Promotions, aka Cyberpromo, was widely blacklisted as a source of unsolicited email. Wallace&#x27;s high-profile pro-spam stance and unrepentant persistence earned him the derisive nickname &#x27;Spamford&#x27;.

Prior to his email spam ventures, Wallace had gained notoriety in other questionable marketing circles, as a heavy utilizer of junk fax marketing, a practice outlawed in the United States since 1991.

In 1995, Wallace formed Cyber Promotions, entering the spam market. Thanks to a self-marketing campaign, Cyberpromo rapidly became the most successful seller of email marketing—as well as the number one source of unsolicited email. In 1996 he was sued by Concentric Network, an ISP, and entered into a consent decree not to use their network again. After Cyberpromo failed to become a legitimate business, Wallace returned to junk faxing in late 1997.

Wallace&#x27;s company brought a number of spam-blocking evasion tactics to the fore of the spam battle. False return addresses, relaying, and multihoming were among the questionable practices used by Cyberpromo to ensure the penetration of their advertising.

==Retirement and reemergence==
In April 1998, Wallace publicly announced that he was quitting the spam business. Cyberpromo was converted to what he claimed was an &quot;opt-in&quot; email marketing company and renamed GTMI. The revised company was plagued by major financial problems, as well as the spectre of its former self, with large numbers of people unconvinced of Wallace&#x27;s change of heart. Wallace pulled out of the new venture quickly. GTMI&#x27;s problematic origin led to its rapid demise.

After Wallace&#x27;s internet connection was disconnected for spamming in 1999, he filed a lawsuit against anti-spam activist Mark Welch, but abandoned the suit a month later.

, Wallace was working as a DJ in New Hampshire, making weekly appearances at area nightclubs. Wallace performed under the name DJ MasterWeb. He was also the owner of a night club in New Hampshire called Plum Crazy, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004. It appears that Wallace did not leave the Internet marketing business entirely. In 2001 he was linked to a website, passthison.com, which utilized multiple-window launching to snag Web viewers, an advertising practice rarely seen outside of the online pornography industry. Wallace was also involved in another opt-in project, SmartBotPRO.NET, which is now apparently also defunct.

On October 8, 2004, the Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Wallace and his company, SmartBOT, for infecting computers with spyware then offering a solution to remove the problem for $30. In January 2005, it was announced that Wallace had agreed to stop distributing the software until the charges with the FTC are settled. Subsequently, a default judgment was issued against Wallace forbidding him and associates from distributing spyware or any other software without consumer&#x27;s consent.

In March 2006, the FTC filed a suit again against Wallace and SmartBOT for practices similar to the 2004 suit. This time Wallace and his co-defendants were ordered to pay $5,089,550.48 in fines.

In 2007, MySpace filed suit against Wallace for phishing and spamming. Wallace had used automated software not allowed by MySpace to create 11,000 fake profiles, in order to direct MySpace users to other websites. In July 2007, US District Judge Audrey B. Collins issued an order prohibiting Wallace from creating or maintaining MySpace profiles, and from using MySpace to post public comments, or send private messages. In April 2008, the California Central District Court issued a default judgment against Wallace in MySpace&#x27;s lawsuit, after Wallace failed to turn over documents or appear in court.

On January 26, 2008, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that the FTC has asked the Judge overseeing the 2006 settlement to find Wallace and partner Walter Rines in civil contempt of court for their use of malware and social engineering on MySpace to promote porn and gambling sites. In May 2008 Wallace and Rines were ordered to pay $230 million to MySpace by the L.A. District Court when they failed to appear for trial.

Facebook sued Wallace in California District Court for posting spam messages on members&#x27; walls. Wallace has already been fined $4 million for installing ad-related spyware on peoples&#x27; computers, and was fined $230 million for his activities on MySpace, according to MediaPost.

Wallace filed for bankruptcy in June 2009. On October 29, 2009, federal judge Jeremy D. Fogel awarded Facebook $711 million in damages. Although Facebook believed it was unlikely to collect due to Wallace&#x27;s bankruptcy, the presiding judge in the case also recommended criminal contempt charges against Wallace, which carry the possibility of incarceration.

On August 4, 2011, Wallace was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Jose, California, on various counts of electronic mail fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and criminal contempt. The indictment followed a two-year investigation by the FBI into his alleged infiltration of Facebook accounts in order to spam its users. Wallace denied the charges and was released on $100,000 bail.

In August 2015, Wallace pleaded guilty to electronic mail fraud and criminal contempt of court as well as admitting to mass spamming in 2008 and 2009. He also pleaded guilty to violating a court order to not access Facebook&#x27;s computer network.

==Conviction==
In June 2016, Wallace was sentenced to thirty months in prison and ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution for bombarding Facebook users. U.S. District Court Judge Edward J. Davila also sentenced Wallace to mental health treatment and five years of probation once he is released. Judge Davila barred Sanford Wallace of possessing or using any computer without the permission of the probation order. He pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail and one count of criminal contempt of court.

Wallace served his sentence in Colorado, where he was assigned Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate number 16075-111. He was released from prison on May 21, 2018, after serving 21 months.

<text>Dafydd Elis Elis-Thomas, Baron Elis-Thomas, (; 18 October 1946 – 7 February 2025) was a Welsh politician who served as the leader of Plaid Cymru from 1984 to 1991 and represented the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency in the Senedd from 1999 to 2021.

Born in Carmarthen, Wales, he was raised in Ceredigion and the Conwy Valley. He represented Merioneth and later Meirionnydd Nant Conwy as a member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1992, and was Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales from the office&#x27;s inception in 1999 to 2011. Elis-Thomas was a member of the House of Lords and a privy counsellor from 1992 and 2004, respectively, until his death. 

From 2007 to 2017 he was the Chancellor of Bangor University. In 2016, he left Plaid Cymru to support Carwyn Jones&#x27;s government in the Senedd, sitting as an independent. He joined the Welsh government in November 2017 and was Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism until May 2021. Elis-Thomas applied to rejoin Plaid Cymru in August 2023, but withdrew his application later in the year.

==Background==

Dafydd Elis Thomas was born on 18 October 1946 at Priory Hospital, Carmarthen, and brought up in the Llandysul area of Ceredigion, and in Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley. In 1970, he married Elen Williams and had three sons. They later divorced. From the mid-1980s until 1992 his partner was Marjorie Thompson, the chairwoman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). In 1993, he married Mair Parry-Jones. Between 1993 and his death, he lived in Llandaff, Cardiff (when working at the Senedd), and Betws-y-Coed (which was in his constituency of Meirionnydd Nant Conwy prior to the 2010 boundary changes).

Elis-Thomas died at home after a short illness, on 7 February 2025, at the age of 78.

==Professional career==
Elis-Thomas was the chairman of the Welsh Language Board between 1994 and 1999, and was a member of the Arts Council of Wales, governor of the British Film Institute and chairman of Screen Wales between 1992 and 1999. He was a director and vice-chairman of Cynefin Environmental Ltd. between 1992 and 1999. A former university lecturer, he was the chancellor and chair of Council at Bangor University between 2000 and 2017, as well as being a member of the governing body of the Church in Wales. He was an honorary president of the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight Cymru.

==Political career==

===UK Parliament===
Having come third at Conwy in the 1970 general election, Thomas served as MP for Merioneth between 1974 and 1983, initially as the Baby of the House, and subsequently as MP for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy from 1983 to 1992. On entering the House of Commons after the February 1974 election, he became one of the first MPs to be allowed to take the oath of allegiance in Welsh as well as in English. For most of his time in the House of Commons, he was one of only two Plaid Cymru MPs, alongside Dafydd Wigley. In 1981, Thomas moved the writ in the Westminster Parliament that allowed for the election of Provisional Irish Republican Army hunger striker Bobby Sands in Fermanagh South Tyrone. Thomas was noted for the number of questions he tabled during his time in parliament, through which he secured economic support for Wales, bolstered the status of the Welsh language and played a leading role in thwarting the closure of the Cambrian Coast railway. In 1991 he announced that he would not stand for parliament at the next election. 

He was created a life peer on 18 September 1992 as &quot;Baron Elis-Thomas, of Nant Conwy in the County of Gwynedd&quot;, with a change of his surname from &quot;Thomas&quot; to &quot;Elis-Thomas&quot;. He sat as a crossbench peer because at that time he had taken on the non-political role of chair of the Welsh Language Board; upon leaving that post in 1999, he took the Plaid Cymru whip in the Lords until leaving the party in 2016. 

===Senedd===
Elis-Thomas was elected to the newly established National Assembly for Wales (now called &quot;Senedd Cymru&quot; or &quot;the Welsh Parliament&quot;, or simply Senedd) in 1999, representing the Meirionnydd Nant Conwy constituency until the 2007 election, and then the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency. He also held the position of Presiding Officer from the Assembly&#x27;s inception in 1999 until 2011. During his tenure as Presiding Officer, he expelled Assembly member Leanne Wood from the Assembly chamber during a December 2004 debate after Wood referred to Queen Elizabeth II as &quot;Mrs Windsor&quot; during a debate and refused to withdraw the remark, the first time an AM was ordered out of the chamber.

From 2011, Elis-Thomas was Plaid Cymru&#x27;s spokesperson for Environment, Energy and Planning before transferring to Rural Affairs, Fisheries and Food in 2012. In October 2016 he left Plaid Cymru, but remained in the Assembly as an Independent member. In November 2017, as part of a Welsh Government reshuffle, Elis-Thomas was appointed as Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport.

He announced on Dewi Llwyd&#x27;s BBC Radio Cymru programme on 12 April 2020 that after long consideration and realising that there were many other ways to serve society, he would not be standing for Dwyfor Meirionnydd in the 2021 Senedd election.

===Europe===
Thomas was a strong supporter of a &quot;no&quot; vote in the 1975 European Communities referendum. Fourteen years later, he contended unsuccessfully for the North Wales European Parliament seat in the 1989 election. On the eve of the 2016 EU referendum, he and two Labour AMs sponsored a Senedd debate on the motion &quot;The National Assembly believes Wales would be stronger, safer and more prosperous if it were to remain a member of the European Union&quot;; it passed by 44 votes to 9. During the discussion, Elis-Thomas said his stance in the 1975 referendum was something he had &quot;regretted ever since&quot;.

<doc id="694767" wikidata="Q322660" url="?curid=694767" title="RPG-7">
<text>The RPG-7 is a portable, reusable, unguided, shoulder-launched, anti-tank, rocket launcher. The RPG-7 and its predecessor, the RPG-2, were designed by the Soviet Union, and are now manufactured by the Russian company Bazalt. The weapon has the GRAU index (Russian armed forces index) 6G3.

The ruggedness, simplicity, low cost, and effectiveness of the RPG-7 has made it the most widely used anti-armor weapon in the world. Currently around 40 countries use the weapon; it is manufactured in several variants by nine countries. It is popular with irregular and guerrilla forces.

Widely produced, the most commonly seen major variations are the RPG-7D (десантник – &quot;desantnik&quot; – paratrooper) model, which can be broken into two parts for easier carrying; and the lighter Chinese Type 69 RPG. DIO of Iran manufactures RPG-7s with olive green handguards, H&amp;K style pistol grips, and a commando variant.

The RPG-7 was first delivered to the Soviet Army in 1961 and deployed at the squad level. It replaced the RPG-2, having clearly out-performed the intermediate RPG-4 design during testing. The current model produced by the Russian Federation is the RPG-7V2, capable of firing standard and dual high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, high explosive/fragmentation, and thermobaric warheads, with a UP-7V sighting device fitted (used in tandem with the standard 2.7× PGO-7 optical sight) to allow the use of extended range ammunition. The RPG-7D3 is the equivalent paratrooper model. Both the RPG-7V2 and RPG-7D3 were adopted by the Russian Ground Forces in 2001.

== Description ==

The launcher is reloadable and based around a steel tube, in diameter, long, and weighing . The middle of the tube is wood wrapped to protect the user from heat and the end is flared. Sighting is usually optical with a back-up iron sight, and passive infrared and night sights are also available. The launchers designated RPG-7N1 and RPG-7DN1 can thus mount the multi-purpose night vision scope 1PN51 and the launchers designated RPG-7N2 and RPG-7DN2 can mount the multi-purpose night vision scope 1PN58.

As with similar weapons, the grenade protrudes from the launch tubes. It is in diameter and weighs between and . It is launched by a gunpowder booster charge, giving it an initial speed of , and creating a cloud of light grey-blue smoke that can give away the position of the shooter. The rocket motor ignites after and sustains flight out to at a maximum velocity of . The grenade is stabilized by two sets of fins that deploy in-flight: one large set on the stabilizer pipe to maintain direction and a smaller rear set to induce rotation. The grenade can fly up to ; the fuze sets the maximum range, usually .

=== Propulsion system ===

According to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Bulletin 3u (1977) &quot;Soviet RPG-7 Antitank Grenade Launcher—Capabilities and Countermeasures&quot;, the RPG-7 munition has two sections: a &quot;booster&quot; section and a &quot;warhead and sustainer motor&quot; section. These must be assembled into the ready-to-use grenade. The booster consists of a &quot;small strip powder charge&quot; that serves to propel the grenade out of the launcher; the sustainer motor then ignites and propels the grenade for the next few seconds, giving it a top speed of . The TRADOC bulletin provides anecdotal commentary that the RPG-7 has been fired from within buildings, which agrees with the two-stage design. It is stated that only a standoff to a rear obstruction is needed for use inside rooms or fortifications. The fins not only provide drag stabilization, but are designed to impart a slow rotation to the grenade.

Due to the configuration of the RPG-7 sustainer/warhead section, it responds counter-intuitively to crosswinds. A crosswind will tend to exert pressure on the stabilizing fins, causing the projectile to turn into the wind (&quot;see Weathervane effect&quot;). While the rocket motor is still burning, this will cause the flight path to curve into the wind. The TRADOC bulletin explains aiming difficulties for more distant moving targets in crosswinds at some length.

== Ammunition ==
The RPG-7 can fire a variety of warheads for anti-armor (HEAT, PG-Protivotankovaya Granata) or anti-personnel (HE, OG-Oskolochnaya Granata) purposes, usually fitting with an impact (PIBD) and a 4.5 second fuze. Armor penetration is warhead dependent and ranges from of RHA; one warhead, the PG-7VR, is a &#x27;tandem charge&#x27; device, used to defeat reactive armor with a single shot. The Russian Ministry of Defense said in December 2023 that it has modified the RPG-7V grenade launcher in order to shoot 82-mm mines.

Current production ammunition for the RPG-7V2 consists of four main types:
* PG-7VL [c.1977] – improved HEAT warhead effective against most vehicles and fortified targets.
* PG-7VR [c.1988] – tandem charge warhead designed to penetrate up to rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) equivalence of explosive reactive armor (ERA) and the conventional armor underneath, or penetrate up to 900mm RHA without ERA. It has a range of .
* TBG-7V Tanin [c.1988] – thermobaric warhead for anti-personnel and urban warfare.
* OG-7V [c.1999] – fragmentation warhead for anti-personnel warfare. Has no sustainer motor.

Other warhead variants include:
* PG-7V [c.1961] – baseline HEAT warhead capable of penetrating RHA.
* PG-7VM [c.1969] – improved HEAT warhead capable of penetrating RHA.
* PG-7VS [c.1972] – improved HEAT warhead capable of penetrating RHA.
* PG-7VS1 [c.mid-1970s] – cheaper PG-7VS version capable of penetrating RHA.
* GSh-7VT [c.2013] – anti-bunker warhead with cylindrical follow-through blast-fragmentation munition followed by explosively formed penetrator.
* OGi-7MA [unknown] – anti-personnel fragmentation munition developed for the Bulgarian ATGL-L. improved equivalent to the Soviet OG-7V. Compatible with RPG-7.

=== Specifications ===
Manufacturer specifications for the RPG-7V1.

== Hit probabilities ==
A 1976 U.S. Army evaluation of the weapon gave the hit probabilities on a panel moving sideways at . Crosswinds cause additional issues as the round steers into the wind; in an wind, firing at a stationary tank sized target, the gunner cannot expect to get a first-round hit more than 50% of the time at .

== History of use ==
The RPG-7 was first used in 1967 by Egypt during the Six-Day War, and by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, but it did not see widespread usage in Vietnam until the following year.

The RPG-7 was used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 2005, most notably in Lurgan, County Armagh, where it was used against British Army observation posts and the towering military base at Kitchen Hill in the town. The IRA also used them in Catholic areas of West Belfast against British Army armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and Army forward operating bases (FOBs). Beechmount Avenue in Belfast became known as &quot;RPG Avenue&quot; after attacks on British troops.

In Mogadishu, Somalia, RPG-7s were used to down two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.

During the first and second Chechen wars, the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria used RPG-7s which they had captured from Soviet bases and used them against Russian armored columns. During the first war, Russians may have lost 100 tanks and 250 armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) in Grozny. The Chechens were able to knock out T-72s with three or four RPG-7 hits. Against T-72s with explosive reactive armor, the Chechens fired an RPG in close range (within ) to detonate the armor and then followed this with RPG hits on the now exposed point of the tank, also from close range. The RPG-7 was also effective against AFVs, buildings and personnel.

The PG-7VR has been used by Iraqi insurgents. On 28 August 2003, it achieved a mobility kill against an American M1 Abrams hitting the left side hull next to the forward section of the engine compartment.

During the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021), several M1A2 Abrams were temporarily disabled by RPG-7 hits.

<text>Ernest Scott Garrett (born July 9, 1959) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , serving from 2003 to 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1990 to 2003. Garrett chaired the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. He lost his reelection bid in 2016 to Democrat Josh Gottheimer, becoming the only incumbent Congressman in New Jersey to be defeated that year.

On June 19, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Garrett to become chairman and president of the Export–Import Bank of the United States, a post that requires confirmation by the United States Senate. In a 10–13 vote on December 19, 2017, the Senate Banking Committee declined to advance his nomination. Garrett was subsequently hired into an excepted service position at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s Office of General Counsel.

==Early life, education and career==
Garrett earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Montclair State College in 1981 and a Juris Doctor from Rutgers School of Law–Camden in 1984.

Born in Bergen County in the town of Englewood, Garrett spent much of his life living in North Jersey. He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1991, and was re-elected five times, serving from 1992 to 2003, representing the 24th legislative district, which covered all of Sussex County and several municipalities in Morris and Hunterdon counties.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Garrett unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Congresswoman Marge Roukema in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, on both occasions running well to the right of Roukema, a leading moderate Republican. In 2002, Roukema retired and Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 46% of the vote over State Assemblyman David C. Russo and State Senator Gerald Cardinale. Of the three major candidates, Garrett was the only one from the more rural western portion of the district, while Russo and Cardinale were both from Bergen County. Although Bergen was the most populous county in the district, Russo and Cardinale split the vote there, while Garrett dominated his base in the western portion of the district.

In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced Democratic candidate Anne Sumers, an ophthalmologist and former Republican. Garrett beat Sumers with 60% of the vote.

Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. In 2006, Garrett defeated Republican primary opponent Michael Cino. In the November 2006 general election, Garrett defeated Paul Aronsohn, a former employee of the U.S. State Department during the Clinton Administration, to win a third term. Garrett defeated Democrat Dennis Shulman 56%–42% in the 2008 general election. In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote. In 2012, Garrett defeated Democrat Adam Gussen with 55% of the vote.

In 2014, Garrett defeated Democratic nominee Roy Cho with 55% of the vote.

Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, as it gained heavily Democratic Hackensack and Teaneck. John McCain carried the old 5th with 54 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have only won the new 5th with 50.5 percent of the vote.

====2016====
Garrett ran for re-election in 2016 as the Republican candidate, besting Michael Cino and Peter Vallorosi in the primary. He faced former Clinton administration speechwriter Josh Gottheimer, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In an article published by OpenSecrets, Garrett was revealed to be heavily reliant on the financial sector to fund his campaign. In 2015, it was reported that Garrett stated he would not pay dues to the NRCC because they had supported openly gay candidates. Gottheimer and national Democratic groups used these comments to attack Garrett as too socially conservative for the district, while Wall Street firms that had donated to Garrett for years reduced their contributions.

Gottheimer won the general election on November 8, 2016, with 50.5% of the vote to Garrett&#x27;s 47.2%. While Garrett carried three of the four counties in the district, he could not overcome a 33,800-vote deficit in the district&#x27;s share of Bergen County; he lost overall by 14,900 votes.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Constitution Caucus (chairman)

===Legislation===
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress), a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs. The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.

==Tenure==
Garrett compiled an unshakably conservative voting record. This was unusual for New Jersey, a state where the brand of Republicanism has traditionally been moderate. He held a lifetime rating of 99.3 from the American Conservative Union. He was one of the most conservative lawmakers ever to represent New Jersey in Congress, and was considered one of the most conservative members of the House. While in Congress, he founded and led the House Constitution Caucus.

During his time in Congress, Garrett was a member of the Liberty Caucus. He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, which serves as a policy alternative to the Republican Study Committee, and is the only New Jersey representative to have been a member of the Freedom Caucus.

===Foreign policy===
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen U.S. lawmakers to introduce a bill in the House of Representatives backing United Nations membership for Taiwan.

===Economic policy===
In 2006, Garrett supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.

Garrett voted to allow oil and gas drilling off the shore of New Jersey. He voted against making &quot;price gouging&quot; by oil companies a crime, and against the Further Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricane Katrina Act of 2005. He was one of four members of the House of Representatives to vote against an extension of unemployment benefits.

Garrett voted against the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. When opponents criticized Garrett for not signing a letter urging the House to provide prompt aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy, Garrett responded by saying he had signed nine other letters seeking aid and had helped sponsor a final bill authorizing money.

===Education===
As a state legislator in 2005, he proposed public schools include lessons on intelligent design alongside evolution. Garrett said he would not advocate for a law mandating changes to the state curriculum.

In July 2007, Garrett proposed an amendment to strike earmarked money in a spending bill for native Alaskan and Hawaiian educational programs. Congressman Don Young of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, &quot;You want my money, my money.&quot; Young went on to suggest that Republicans had lost their majority in the 2006 election because some Republicans had challenged spending earmarks. While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young&#x27;s remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the Republican Study Committee gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group&#x27;s weekly meeting.

===LGBT rights===
Following the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2015, Garrett supported the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill allowing companies to deny service to same-sex weddings due to religious objections.

Also in 2015, Garrett refused to pay GOP campaign arm dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee because he said they were &quot;actively recruiting homosexual candidates and had supported gay candidates in the past.&quot; Garrett later clarified his remarks, saying that he is opposed to same-sex marriage due to his faith, but that he does not &quot;have malice&quot; toward any group of people. Regarding his stance opposing gay Republican political candidates, he said that political opponents in the media distorted his views; while he affirmed that it was &quot;everybody&#x27;s right&quot; to run for office, he reiterated his opposition to funding the campaigns of candidates who support same-sex marriage.

===Suffrage===
In 2006, Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, citing his opposition to requirements to print non-English ballots.

==Export-Import Bank nomination==
On April 14, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Garrett to become chairman and president of the Export–Import Bank of the United States. While in the House of Representatives, Garrett was a critic of the bank&#x27;s existence. On June 19, 2017, Trump formally nominated Garrett to the post, which requires confirmation by the United States Senate.

Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, was surprised by the nomination, saying that he had been led to believe that Trump would not go ahead with choosing Garrett in light of the opposition. Brown predicted that no Democrats would vote for Garrett, and that some Republicans would also be &quot;unhappy with [the nomination].&quot;

The nomination drew opposition from a number of national business organizations, such as the Aerospace Industries Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was one of the Republicans reported to have concerns with the nomination. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce opposed Garrett, and Graham said he would &quot;try to get the administration to give us a better nominee.&quot; The New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the largest business group in Garrett&#x27;s home state, called on him to withdraw from consideration for the post.

In August 2017, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Trump would give Garrett a chance to rescue his nomination after privately questioning whether the nomination should proceed. Conservatives opposed to the Ex-Im Bank &quot;have ratcheted up pressure on the administration to stick with Garrett’s nomination.&quot; Republican U.S. Senator Pat Toomey said: &quot;I can tell you there will be Republican senators including myself who will put up quite a fight if his nomination doesn&#x27;t go forward.&quot;

On December 19, 2017, the Senate Banking Committee voted by a margin of 10-13 not to advance Garrett&#x27;s nomination to the full U.S. Senate. Republican U.S. Senators Mike Rounds and Tim Scott joined all of the Democrats on the committee in voting against Garrett. Trump did not formally withdraw the nomination; rather it was returned to Trump unconfirmed on January 3, 2018, under Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XXXI, paragraph 6.

==Personal life==
Garrett is married and has two adult daughters. They homeschooled their daughters because there was &quot;no high school offering a Christian education&quot; in their area.

==Electoral history==

Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2004, Socialist Party USA candidate Gregory Pason received 574 votes. In 2010, James Radigan received 336 votes.

<text>Abraham Osheroff (October 24, 1915 – April 6, 2008) was an American social activist, carpenter, war veteran, documentary filmmaker, and lecturer.

==Biography==
Born into a family of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Sarah and Louis Osheroff, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, he spoke Yiddish and &quot;a good smattering of Russian&quot; before English and graduated from the City College of New York.

In the early 1930s, he began political work. In 1931, during the Great Depression, the police arrested him for moving the furniture of evicted families back into their houses. A policeman, who was a member of the American National Socialist Bund, beat up Osheroff while he was incarcerated and called him a &quot;Goddamn Jew.&quot; Around this time, he joined the Communist Party. In 1935, aged 20, he was organizing miners&#x27; unions on behalf of the party and raising aid for striking workers.

When the Spanish Civil War came in 1936, Abe felt no real compulsion to go and fight, until he saw the bombing of Guernica by the Luftwaffe. This convinced him to fight, as he believed no one should be allowed to inflict such suffering on others and get away with it. He joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and was wounded at the Battle Of Belchite (1937).

Back home in 1938 after a severe injury to his knee, Osheroff ran for the New York Legislature as a Communist. When World War II broke out, he enlisted in the US Army to fight the Third Reich in Europe. The Army did not allow him to go overseas because they were concerned about his political views. Instead, he served as an instructor, rank Sgt..based primarily in the South.

At the beginning of World War II, he married his first wife, Sylvia, and had a son Carl. After the war, he taught at the Jefferson School of Social Science in New York, a Marxist adult school with ties to the Communist Party. After his first wife divorced him, he married Claire Rosenbaum in New York City and they went semi-underground in 1949, moving around the country, working as a carpenter under an assumed name after a tip-off that he was pursued by the FBI. He left in 1951, under persecution from the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

He left the Communist Party in response to the revelation of Stalin&#x27;s purges, and in 1956, moved to California with his wife and two-year-old son, Pete (b. 1954). He abandoned the family many times in order to pursue more lofty goals of &quot;saving the world&quot; and in 1959, when his daughter, Jo (b. 1958), was only six months old, his wife filed for divorce. In 1962, Abe married his third wife Noel Carrawan. They had three children, Nick (b. 1959), Dov (b. 1962), and Sara (b. 1964) and lived in Venice, California until they divorced in 1972. Abe was key in the struggle to save the Venice Canals from development and to stop authorities from driving out the poor families, like his, that dominated the area. Abe worked as a carpenter and taught his two sons, Nick and Dov, the trade.

After splitting from many of his best friends in the Communist Party, he threw his efforts into the Civil Rights Movement building a community center in 1965, in Holmes County, Mississippi, where he was threatened by the police because he was working with African Americans (the police were allied with Ku Klux Klan elements). Osheroff had initially thought to make a contribution to the civil rights movement in the American South by rebuilding the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, however, after discussing the matter with Myles Horton, Highlander&#x27;s founder, a plan was developed to build a community center in Mississippi instead. While building the Mileston Community Center, Abe stayed with Hartman Turnbow, a leader of the movement in Holmes County.

In 1974 he completed the documentary &quot;Dreams and Nightmares&quot;, on the Spanish military bases sold to Francoist Spain by Richard Nixon, which shocked many, as at the time Nixon was still a popular president. &quot;Dreams &amp; Nightmares&quot; won the top award at a socialist documentary film festival in Leipzig, then in Socialist East Germany. Permission to return to Spain in 1971 in order to create the documentary was obtained because Osheroff, despite his lack of experience, succeeded in duping the authorities of Francoist Spain.

In 1985, he organized a village building brigade in America to travel to Nicaragua to aid the Sandinistas. Later, he was highly active in movements opposing the Gulf War and Iraq War, and he drove the Peace Mobile.

In March 2008, Osheroff traveled with his wife, Gunnel Clark, and friends from his Seattle home to San Francisco for the unveiling of the United States&#x27;s first monument to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was determined to go, and it took great effort to get him there. But Osheroff was the guest of honor, one of the 20 or so last survivors of the Brigade. Osheroff used to say, &quot;I have one foot in the grave but the other keeps dancing.&quot;

After more than seven decades of deep involvement with what he called &quot;radical humanism,&quot; Osheroff died on April 6, 2008, a few days after returning to Seattle.

<text>Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is a historic psychiatric diagnosis first defined in 1980 that has since been incorporated into autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5 (2013).

According to the earlier DSM-IV, PDD-NOS referred to &quot;mild or severe pervasive deficits in the development of reciprocal social interaction and/or verbal and nonverbal communication skills, or when stereotyped behavior, interests, and/or activities are present, but the criteria are not met for a specific PDD&quot; or for several other disorders.

PDD-NOS was one of four disorders collapsed into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5, and also was one of the five disorders classified as a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in the DSM-IV. The ICD-10 equivalents also became part of its definition of autism spectrum disorder, as of the ICD-11.

PDD-NOS included atypical autism, a diagnosis defined in the ICD-10 for the case that the criteria for &quot;autistic disorder&quot; were not met because of late age of onset, or atypical symptomatology, or both of these.

Even though PDD-NOS was considered milder than typical autism, this was not always true. While some characteristics may be milder, others may be more severe.

==Signs and symptoms==
It is common for individuals with PDD-NOS to have more intact social skills and a lower level of intellectual deficit than individuals with other PDDs. Characteristics of many individuals with PDD-NOS are:
* Communication difficulties (e.g., using and understanding language)
* Difficulty with social behavior
* Uneven skill development (strengths in some areas and delays in others)
* Unusual play with toys and other objects
* Repetitive body movements or behavior patterns
* Preoccupation with fantasies that interfere and that are not normal to have at a certain age depending on social, cultural and religious norms.
* Unconventional perception of the world

==Diagnosis==
PDD-NOS is not a current part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders typology (as of the DSM-5), which is the most common diagnostic typology used in the United States. In the still used (though deprecated) ICD-10, it is considered &quot;atypical autism&quot; and &quot;pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified&quot;.

The diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified was given to individuals with difficulties in the areas of social interaction, communication, and/or stereotypic behavior patterns or interests, but who did not meet the full DSM-IV criteria for autism or another PDD. This does not necessarily mean that PDD-NOS is a milder disability than the other PDDs. It could simply mean that individuals who receive this diagnosis do not meet the diagnostic criteria of the other PDDs, but that there is still a pervasive developmental disorder that affects the individual in the areas of communication, socialization, and behavior.

As for the other pervasive developmental disorders, the diagnosis of PDD-NOS required the involvement of a team of specialists. The individual needs to undergo a full diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical, social, adaptive, motor skills and communication history. Other parts of an assessment can be behavioral rating scales, direct behavioral observations, psychological assessment, educational assessment, communication assessment, and occupational assessment.

Description of PDD-NOS merely as a &quot;subthreshold&quot; category without a more specific case definition poses methodological problems for research regarding the relatively heterogeneous group of people who receive this diagnosis. While it is true that children diagnosed with PDD-NOS, as a whole, show fewer intellectual deficits and are higher-functioning than autistic children, many others who fit the criteria for PDD-NOS have some autistic features but also have intellectual deficits that are so severe that it is difficult or impossible to tell whether some of the deficits come from the autism or from the severe to profound degree of intellectual disability itself. Furthermore, some others who fit the criteria for PDD-NOS come to professional attention at a later age, compared to those diagnosed with autism.

===Subgroups===
In 2004, Walker et al. found that persons with PDD-NOS belonged to one of three very different subgroups:
* A high-functioning group (around 25 percent) whose symptoms more or less overlap with that of what was Asperger syndrome, while also not meeting the then current criteria for autism spectrum disorder, but who completely differ from those with Asperger syndrome in terms of having a lag in language development and/or mild cognitive impairment. (The criteria for Asperger syndrome excludes a speech delay or a cognitive delay in early life.)
* Another group (around 25 percent) whose symptoms more closely resemble those of autism, but do not fully meet all its diagnostic signs and symptoms. This is because either the symptoms were recognized at a later age or because they were too young or have cognitive deficits that are too severe to properly identify all the symptoms of autism that they may have.
* The biggest group (around 50 percent) consists of those who met all the diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder but whose stereotypical and repetitive behaviors were noticeably mild.

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for PDD-NOS, but there are interventions that can have a positive influence.

Some of the more common therapies and services include:
* Visual and environmental supports, visual schedules
* Social stories and comic strip conversations
* Speech therapy
* Physical and occupational therapy

<text>The Old Harrison County Courthouse is located in the center of Whetstone Square in Marshall, Texas and is one of the most famous and admired buildings in Texas. It is the signature landmark of Marshall and is frequently used to represent East Texas in travel literature.

The Old Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From 1964 until 2000 the building housed the Harrison County Historical Museum. The building is noted as being the location of the first sit-ins in Texas.

==Design==
The structure was designed by James Riely Gordon and supervised by a local architect C. G. Lancaster.

===The Dome===
The building&#x27;s dome is its most distinctive feature and stands above a four-level rotunda. The rotunda is crowned by a coffered or false dome. Between the coffered dome and the outer dome are the workings of four-faced clock, that has been recently restored. Surrounding the coffered dome are six walls, which would resemble a hexagon if view from above, all of which support the outer dome. On the outside is a false portico aligned with each wall. Where the side of the hexagonal floor plan meet, a V-shaped brick pillar where two sides of the hexagon meet; thus each side of the V-shaped brick pillars span two porticos. In between the V-shaped brick pillars are three marble columns; one on each side of every window set into the walls supporting the outer dome. The windows are aligned to feed light through stained glass insets in the coffered dome hanging over the rotunda.

A cornice extends out over the false porticos and their pillar from the bottom of the outer dome. A balustrade, runs along the top of the cornice which like the porticos below it would appear as a hexagon if viewed from above. Eagle statues are perched wherever two sides of six-sided balustrade meet. The outer dome rise in from the cornice, which if viewed from above would appear as a circle inside a hexagon. The north, south, east, and west side of the outer dome are interrupted by clock faces, which maintain a vertical position even as the outer dome curves backwards. A false belfry, reminiscent of the lantern on top of the United States Capitol building, is located on top of the outer dome. On the top of the belfry is a statue of &quot;Lady Justitia&quot;, which has the typical features of any Lady Justice: a blindfold, scales, and raised sword; as well as the rather &quot;atypical&quot; feature of a set of wings.

<doc id="694787" wikidata="Q2306995" url="?curid=694787" title="The Dukes of Hazzard (film)">
<text>The Dukes of Hazzard is a 2005 American action comedy film loosely based on the television series of the same name. The film was directed by Jay Chandrasekhar and stars Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, Jessica Simpson in her feature film debut, Burt Reynolds, Joe Don Baker, Lynda Carter, and Willie Nelson.

As in the television series, the film depicts the adventures of cousins Bo, Luke, and Daisy, and their Uncle Jesse, as they outfox crooked Hazzard County Commissioner Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.

The film was released on August 5, 2005, by Warner Bros. Pictures. While financially successful with an opening debut of $30 million and a worldwide gross of $109.8 million, the film met with generally negative reviews from critics. The film was followed by a direct-to-video prequel titled &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot; (2007).

==Plot==
Cousins Bo, Luke, and Daisy Duke run a moonshine business for their Uncle Jesse in Hazzard County, Georgia. The cousins&#x27; primary mode of transportation is an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that the boys affectionately refer to as the &quot;General Lee&quot;. Along the way, the family is tormented by corrupt Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis Hogg, widely known as &quot;Boss Hogg&quot;, and his willing but dimwitted henchman, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.

After Rosco has the General Lee vandalized after Bo and Luke&#x27;s attempt to run away from a daughter of one of their many moonshine customers, Billy Prickett, a famous stock-car driver, enters Hazzard to participate in the rally. Meanwhile, Rosco plants a fake moonshine still in Uncle Jesse&#x27;s barn and seizes the Duke property in the interest of eminent domain for Boss Hogg, forcing the family to temporarily reside with neighbor Pauline. She informs the Dukes that Rosco seized another farm on charges, so Bo and Luke investigate a local construction site and find their farm and neighboring farms marked on a map. They also discover a safe which they believe contains information that Boss Hogg wants to keep secret, unable to get the safe open they drag it to Sheev&#x27;s. With his help they blow open the safe and discover geologic core samples but are unsure on what the samples are. Meanwhile, Cooter Davenport turns the General Lee into a hot rod in hopes of finally receiving payment for all the work he has done for the boys in the past if they win the race.
The Dukes go to Atlanta to visit a local university geology lab, meeting with Katie-Lynn Johnson, a Hazzard county girl. They discover Boss Hogg&#x27;s intentions of turning the county into a strip coal mine. However, before they can return to Hazzard country, they are arrested. Boss Hogg visits their prison cell, where he informs the Dukes that the vote on Hogg&#x27;s proposition is at the same time as the rally, with Billy Prickett providing an distraction. During a transfer from detainment, Daisy helps the boys escape from the patrol car, and they speed home to try to inform the townsfolk, escaping the Atlanta Police, and the Georgia State Patrol.

Upon returning home, the Dukes discover that Boss Hogg and Rosco had taken Uncle Jesse and Pauline hostage. The two race to the farmhouse to cause a distraction to the waiting Hazzard County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies and Georgia State Troopers, while Daisy and Cooter rescue Jesse and Pauline. Meanwhile, the college girls head to the rally with Sheev to inform the townsfolk about the vote on the strip-mining ordinance, however; because Sheev is a known conspiracy theorist, no one listens to them. Bo leaves for the rally while Luke and Jesse team up to foil the county and state police. Upon crossing the finish line first before Billy, the two then continue racing across town, leading the townsfolk to the courthouse, where the proposal is rejected.

Boss Hogg attempt&#x27;s to have the boys locked up but Daisy takes advantage of the governor of Georgia&#x27;s presence and TV cameras to convince him to pardoning them. The final scene shows a cook-out at the Dukes&#x27; house where the Dukes and the townspeople celebrate.

The film was number one at the box office its opening weekend and grossed $30.7 million on 3,785 screens. It also had an adjusted-dollar rank of number 24 all-time for August releases. The film eventually collected $109.8 million worldwide, although it was much less successful financially outside the United States.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, 14% of 168 reviews were positive. The website&#x27;s consensus called the film &quot;A dumb, goofy, and vacuous adaptation of a TV show where plot is simply an excuse to string together the car chases.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 33% based on 36 reviews, indicating &quot;Generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F. Longtime fans of the original &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; series were generally disappointed by the film.

Roger Ebert gave the film one star, calling it a &quot;lame-brained, outdated wheeze&quot; and wondered if Burt Reynolds&#x27; part in the film is &quot;karma-wise... the second half of what &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; was the first half of&quot;. Ebert also named it the second-worst film of the year and Richard Roeper named it the worst film of 2005. Ebert also included the film on his most hated list.

Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it B+ grade and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s trash, all right, but perfectly skewed trash -- a comedy that knows just how smart to be about just how dumb it is.&quot;

===Awards===

At the 26th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film received seven nominations, but did not win any.
* Worst Picture - lost to &quot;Dirty Love&quot;
* Worst Director (Jay Chandrasekhar) - lost to John Mallory Asher for &quot;Dirty Love&quot;
* Worst Screenplay (John O&#x27;Brien) - lost to Jenny McCarthy for &quot;Dirty Love&quot;
* Worst Supporting Actor (Burt Reynolds) - lost to Hayden Christensen in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;
* Worst Supporting Actress (Jessica Simpson) - lost to Paris Hilton in &quot;House of Wax&quot;
* Worst Screen Couple (Jessica Simpson and her Daisy Dukes) - lost to Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in &quot;Bewitched&quot;
* Worst Remake or Sequel - lost to &quot;Son of the Mask&quot;

At the People&#x27;s Choice Awards, Simpson won the &quot;Favorite Song from a Movie&quot; award for her cover of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;.

The film was nominated for two MTV Movie Awards, including Best On-Screen Team (Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, and Jessica Simpson), and Sexiest Performance (Jessica Simpson).

Simpson won the Choice Breakout Female award for her role in the film at the Teen Choice Awards.

==Controversies==
Before the release of this film, Warner Bros. reportedly paid $17.5 million to the producer of &quot;Moonrunners&quot;, the movie that inspired the television series. This was soon followed by a claim from screenwriter Gy Waldron. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that James Best, who portrayed Rosco P. Coltrane in the original series, filed suit in late July 2011 over royalties he was contracted to receive over spinoffs that &quot;used his identity&quot;.

Ben Jones, who played Cooter Davenport in the original series, criticized the film for its emphasis on sexual content, suggesting that the original series was more family-oriented and not as sexualized. He called for fans of the television series to boycott the film &quot;unless they clean it up before the August 5th release date.&quot; Some have countered that the original series also contained sexual themes, primarily Catherine Bach&#x27;s (Daisy Duke) much-displayed &quot;short shorts&quot; (which have become so ubiquitous in American culture that skimpy blue jean cutoff shorts are now often simply called &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot;). In a film review, a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; entertainment columnist said the movie&#x27;s sex humor is &quot;cruder&quot; than the TV series, but that it is &quot;nearly identical to the TV series in... its ogling of the posterior of cousin Daisy Duke.&quot;

Although initially he commented that he enjoyed the new style of relationship between the movie versions of Bo and Luke, John Schneider, who played Bo Duke in the original series, was later asked if he saw the film and said: &quot;My gosh... it was terrible! It wasn&#x27;t Dukes. It was true to whatever it was; I just don&#x27;t know what that was!&quot;

John Schneider has said that when he arrived at the premiere, Johnny Knoxville came up to him and apologized for how bad the film was. Schneider has also questioned why TV channels show the film but are not prepared to rerun the original series.

==Differences from source material==

* In the series, Bo and Luke Duke were on probation, and Jesse had quit moonshining to keep them out of prison. A frequent obstacle as the result of their probation was their inability to leave Hazzard County without the consent of Boss Hogg. In the film, the Dukes are still actively producing and distributing moonshine, and Bo and Luke freely travel to Atlanta.
* Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane are portrayed as far more serious and sinister than their TV counterparts. In the series, Hogg was very opposed to violence and would often abandon schemes if any characters were put in harm&#x27;s way. In the film, Hogg has Jesse and Pauline (an original character) held hostage in one scene, and pays for an annoying prisoner to be knocked unconscious in another.
* When the series portrayed the origins of the General Lee, the car immediately showcased its iconic design. In the opening of the film, the design of the General is rather different, with a crudely-styled 01 on the doors and missing the Confederate flag and name above the windows. When Cooter restores the General after it is vandalized by Boss Hogg&#x27;s associates, the classic design is applied.
* In most of the series, the Hazzard County Police Department is limited to Sheriff Coltrane and one deputy (Enos or Cletus). In the film, the police department seems to be rather extensive for a small town.
* In the series, Luke was a former Sergeant of the U.S. Marine Corps. This is not mentioned in the film. Contrarily, in the film, Jesse is introduced as a Korean War veteran, though the series did not portray him as a veteran.

==Soundtrack==
Jessica Simpson recorded her own version of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; (and added her own lyrics) for the soundtrack to the film. Performed from the point of view of her character in the movie, Simpson&#x27;s cover was co-produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and was released as the soundtrack&#x27;s first single in 2005. It became Simpson&#x27;s fifth top-20 single in the United States and its music video drew some controversy because of its sexual imagery. Both the original Ram Jam version of &quot;Black Betty&quot;, and the Sylvia Massy produced remake by Spiderbait appear in the film. AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;If You Want Blood (You&#x27;ve Got It)&quot; and &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; are also played.

==Unrated cut==
An unrated cut restored changes made to get a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. The unrated cut was released on DVD, and included rated and unrated bonus features, including unrated deleted scenes and blooper scenes. This edition was not rated by the MPAA, and contained additional nudity, language, and violent driving stunts.

==Prequel==
A prequel to the film, titled &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot;, was released to television on March 4, 2007, and released to DVD on March 13, 2007.

<doc id="694796" wikidata="Q670440" url="?curid=694796" title="Michael Parenti">
<text>Michael John Parenti (born September 30, 1933) is an American political scientist, academic historian and cultural critic who writes on scholarly and popular subjects. He has taught at universities as well as run for political office. Parenti is well known for his Marxist writings and lectures, and is an intellectual of the American Left.

==Education and personal life==
Michael Parenti was raised by an Italian-American working-class family in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City. After graduating from high school, Parenti worked for several years. Upon returning to school, he received a BA from the City College of New York, an MA from Brown University and a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University. In recent decades, he has made his home in Berkeley, California. He is the father of Christian Parenti, an academic, author and journalist.

==Career==

Following completion of his doctorate, Parenti taught political and social science at various institutions of higher learning, including the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UI). In May 1970 while he was an associate professor at UI, he participated in a rally protesting the recent Kent State shootings and ongoing Vietnam War. At the rally he was severely clubbed by state troopers and then held in a jail cell for two days.
He was charged with aggravated battery (of a state trooper), disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest. After being released on bond, he started a new teaching job at the University of Vermont (UVM) in September. The next month he returned to Illinois to stand trial before a judge. Despite multiple witnesses exonerating Parenti, the judge found him guilty on all three counts. Here&#x27;s how he describes what happened next:
This incident effectively ended Parenti&#x27;s career as a professor. In December 1971, after his UVM department voted unanimously to renew his teaching contract, the UVM board of trustees and conservative state legislators intervened and voted to &quot;not&quot; renew, citing Parenti&#x27;s &quot;unprofessional conduct.&quot; The battle over his continued presence on the UVM faculty lasted into early 1972, but ultimately he lost his position there.

In subsequent years, he was unable to obtain another non-temporary teaching job. He learned from sympathetic associates at the colleges he applied to that he was being rejected for his leftist views and political activism. He chronicles this period of his life in the essay, &quot;Struggles in Academe: A Personal Account&quot;, published in &quot;Dirty Truths&quot;. He discusses the broader question of political orthodoxy in U.S. higher education in &quot;The Empire in Academia&quot; chapter of his 1995 book, &quot;Against Empire&quot;.
Because he couldn&#x27;t earn a steady livelihood as a professor, Parenti began to devote himself full-time to writing, public speaking, and politics.

In 1974, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Vermont as the candidate of the democratic socialist Liberty Union Party; he finished in third place with 7.1% of the vote. During his years in Vermont, Parenti became good friends with Bernie Sanders. However, the two men later split over Sanders&#x27; support for the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

In the 1980s, Parenti was a visiting fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. In 2003, the Caucus for a New Political Science gave him a Career Achievement Award. In 2007, he received a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from U.S. Representative Barbara Lee.

He served for 12 years as a judge for Project Censored. He also is on the advisory boards of Independent Progressive Politics Network and Education Without Borders as well as the advisory editorial boards of &quot;New Political Science&quot; and &quot;Nature, Society and Thought&quot;.

In his book &quot;To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia&quot;, Parenti denounced what he considered the demonization, by the U.S. and its allies, of Slobodan Milošević and the Serbian Socialist Party. In 2003, Parenti became Chairman of the U.S. National Section of the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milošević (ICDSM). The committee was formed to urge an end to the war crimes trial of Milošević that commenced in 2002 at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague.

== Published work ==
The first notable book in Parenti&#x27;s writing career was &quot;Democracy for the Few&quot;. Originally published in 1974, it has since gone through nine editions and been used as a textbook in college political science courses. &quot;Democracy for the Few&quot; contains a critical analysis of the workings of American government with particular focus on the relationship between economic power and political power.

As a rule, Parenti&#x27;s books were not reviewed in mainstream publications. The one exception was &quot;Inventing Reality: The Politics of the Mass Media&quot; (1986) which was reviewed by multiple scholarly journals and by Michael Pollan in The New York Times. Pollan wrote: &quot;By documenting patterns of conservative bias in a dozen major news stories in the printed and broadcast press, &quot;Inventing Reality&quot; provides a valuable rebuttal to the drumbeat of criticism of the news media from the right. Unfortunately, Mr. Parenti is so simplistic and doctrinaire in accounting for this bias that he makes his book easy to dismiss.&quot; The reviewer went on to note how the author &quot;paints the press in such broad, Marxist strokes that he ignores many details. He cannot, for example, adequately account for episodes of courage and independence, as during Vietnam and Watergate.&quot;
In a response to the review published as a Letter to the Editor, Parenti challenged Pollan&#x27;s negative assessment.

Parenti continued his exploration of mass media in &quot;Make-Believe Media: The Politics of Entertainment&quot; (1992). The book dissects numerous popular movies and TV programs which, in Parenti&#x27;s view, &quot;have propagated images and themes that support militarism, imperialism, racism, sexism, authoritarianism, and other undemocratic values.&quot; He describes what he believes is a pattern of unflattering portrayals of working-class people and trade unions, and he disputes the notion that the major studios are &quot;giving audiences what they want.&quot; In his Foreword to Matthew Alford&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy&quot;, Parenti reiterated several of the points from &quot;Make-Believe Media&quot;. Other leftist writers have been influenced by his media critiques.

Along with his interest in mass media&#x27;s role in society, Parenti has regularly published articles and books on cultural matters, e.g., &quot;Reflections on the Politics of Culture&quot;, in which he echoes Antonio Gramsci that culture &quot;is largely reflective of existing hegemonic arrangements within the social order, strongly favoring some interests over others.&quot; He further develops this idea in his books &quot;Land of Idols&quot;, &quot;Superpatriotism&quot;, &quot;The Culture Struggle&quot;, and &quot;God and His Demons&quot;.

&quot;Dirty Truths: Reflections on Politics, Media, Ideology, Conspiracy, Ethnic Life and Class Power&quot; (1996) contains Parenti&#x27;s most wide-ranging collection of writings. Among its essays are &quot;Fascism in a Pinstriped Suit&quot; on the possibility of American fascism arriving subtly and gradually rather than intruding in a nightmarish &quot;Big Brother&quot; fashion; &quot;Now for the Weather&quot; on how even TV weather reports can be politicized; and &quot;False Consciousness&quot; on why the lower classes sometimes adopt the opinions and attitudes of the upper classes. In two essays on the JFK assassination, he breaks ranks with fellow leftists such as Noam Chomsky by giving credence to skeptics of the official government narrative. He also explores what he calls &quot;Conspiracy Phobia on the Left&quot;. &quot;Dirty Truths&quot; concludes with autobiographical sketches and poems.

Parenti&#x27;s provocative 1997 book &quot;Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism&quot; begins by examining the ideological underpinnings of European fascism in the 1920s and &#x27;30s as well as its incarnations as neofascism. He then takes the controversial position of defending the Soviet Union and other communist countries from reflexive condemnation, arguing that they featured a number of advantages over capitalist countries, e.g., by ensuring less economic inequality. He summarizes his approach in the Preface to &quot;Blackshirts and Reds&quot;:
 He later argues that the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;well-publicized deficiencies and injustices&quot; were exacerbated by the Russian Civil War, the Nazi-led multinational invasion, and by non-military modes of capitalist intervention against the Eastern Bloc. Moreover, he claims that &quot;pure socialists&quot; and &quot;left anticommunists&quot; had failed to specify a viable alternative to the &quot;siege socialism&quot; implemented in the Soviet model. By offering a rare defense of 20th century socialism, &quot;Blackshirts and Reds&quot; has elicited strong reactions from anarchist and leftist publications.

== Appearances in media ==
Apart from video recordings of his public speaking engagements, Parenti has also appeared in the 1992 documentary &quot;The Panama Deception&quot;, and in the 2004 &quot;Liberty Bound&quot; and 2013 &quot;Fall and Winter&quot; documentaries as an author and social commentator.

In July 2003, Parenti was invited on the C-SPAN Booknotes program to discuss his latest work, &quot;The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People&#x27;s History of Ancient Rome&quot;. He appeared in an episode of the Showtime series &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, speaking briefly about the Dalai Lama (Episode 305 – Holier Than Thou).

Because of his research for the book &quot;To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia&quot; (2000) and his travel in the war-torn region shortly after the NATO bombing⁠, Parenti was interviewed in Boris Malagurski&#x27;s documentary film &quot;The Weight of Chains&quot; (2010) and its sequel &quot;The Weight of Chains 2&quot; (2014) about the former Yugoslavia.

New York City-based punk rock band Choking Victim use a number of samples from Michael Parenti&#x27;s lectures in their album &quot;No Gods, No Managers&quot;.

<text>Friendship of peoples (, &quot;druzhba narodov&quot;) is a concept advanced by Marxist social class theory. According to Marxism, nationalism is only a tool of the ruling class, used to keep the working class divided and thus easier to control and exploit. With the success of class struggle (i.e. the abolition of social classes), the natural brotherhood of all workers would make the idea of separate nations obsolete.

The concept of the friendship of peoples is often opposed to &quot;bourgeois cosmopolitanism&quot;. The concept of friendship of peoples was opposed to the concept of internationalism. In this context, the notion of internationalism was explained as &quot;bourgeois cosmopolitanism&quot;, so the notion of &quot;internationalism&quot; was conceptually replaced by the notion of &quot;international socialism&quot;, also known as &quot;proletarian internationalism&quot;.

== History ==
The Tsarist Russian Empire was dubbed the &quot;prison of the peoples&quot; (&quot;тюрьма народов&quot;) by Vladimir Lenin. The Soviet Union, which replaced the empire, proclaimed that the goal of its national policy was to forge a new national entity, the &quot;Soviet people&quot;. Leading up to and during the establishment of Bolshevik power, the friendship of peoples narrative limited the scope of Russian exceptionalism, however, throughout World War II the metaphor experienced a reconfiguration and the leading role of Russians in the October Revolution, as well as cultural and technological advancements of the Soviet Union was increasingly emphasized. Under Joseph Stalin despite the ubiquitous slogan of &quot;friendship of the peoples&quot; between 1939 and 1953 a total of approximately 6 million people from many of the Soviet Union&#x27;s ethnic minorities (Ukrainians, Poles, Romanians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Volga Germans, Finns, Crimean Tatars, Crimean Greeks, Kalmyks, Balkars, Karachays, Meskhetian Turks, Koreans, Chechens, Ingush, and others) were forcefully resettled or deported, often to remote locations in the Far East or Central Asia, 1.5 million of whom died of disease or hunger, which in some cases made up more than 40 percent of a deported population. 

The Constitution of the USSR of 1977 stated: &quot;The union of the working class, the collective farm peasantry and the people&#x27;s intelligentsia, the friendship of peoples and nationalities of the USSR have been strengthened.&quot; Even though the Soviet Union often claimed to make significant progress on &quot;the nationalities question&quot;, its dissolution came about largely due to inter-ethnic conflict and like other communist countries a privileged nationality (in this case the Russians, in Yugoslavia the Serbs, in Vietnam the Kinh people and in China the Han Chinese) had more political and economic power . Some historians evaluating the Soviet Union as a colonial empire, applied the &quot;prison of nations&quot; idea to the USSR. Thomas Winderl wrote &quot;The USSR became in a certain sense more a prison-house of nations than the old Empire had ever been.&quot; Historian Kevin O&#x27;Connor similarly described the concept &quot;friendship of peoples&quot; as &quot;a metaphor that was intended to signify the existence of a multinational community on Soviet soil, but which in reality put the Russians &quot;first among equals.&quot;

<text>The Soviet occupation zone in Germany ( or , ; ) was an area of Germany that was occupied by the Soviet Union as a communist area, established as a result of the Potsdam Agreement on 2 August 1945. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR), commonly referred to in English as East Germany, was established in the Soviet occupation zone.

The SBZ was one of the four Allied occupation zones of Germany created at the end of World War II with the Allied victory. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German initials: SMAD) was assigned responsibility for the middle portion of Germany. Eastern Germany beyond the Oder-Neisse line, equal in territory to the SBZ, was to be annexed by Poland and its population expelled, pending a final peace conference with Germany.

By the time armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom began to meet Soviet Union forces, forming the Line of Contact, significant areas of what would become the Soviet zone of Germany were outside Soviet control. After several months of occupation, these gains by the British and Americans were ceded to the Soviets by July 1945, according to the previously agreed occupation zone boundaries.

The SMAD allowed four political parties to develop, though they were all required to work together under an alliance known as the &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot; (later the National Front). In April 1946, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) were forcibly merged to form the Socialist Unity Party which later became the governing party of the GDR.

The SMAD set up ten &quot;special camps&quot; for the detention of Germans, making use of some former Nazi concentration camps.

In 1945, the Soviet occupation zone consisted primarily of the central portions of Prussia. After Prussia was dissolved by the Allied powers in 1947, the area was divided between the German states &quot;(Länder)&quot; of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. On 7 October 1949, the Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic. In 1952, the &quot;Länder&quot; were dissolved and realigned into 14 districts &quot;(Bezirke)&quot;, plus the district of East Berlin.

In 1952, with the Cold War political confrontation well underway, Joseph Stalin sounded out the Western Powers about the prospect of a united Germany which would be non-aligned (the &quot;Stalin Note&quot;). The West&#x27;s lack of interest in this proposal helped to cement the Soviet Zone&#x27;s identity as the GDR for the next four decades.

&quot;Soviet zone&quot; and derivatives (or also, &quot;the so-called GDR&quot;) remained official and common names for East Germany in West Germany, which refused to acknowledge the existence of a state in East Germany until 1972, when the government of Willy Brandt extended a qualified recognition under its Ostpolitik initiative.

<doc id="694829" wikidata="Q273219" url="?curid=694829" title="António Egas Moniz">
<text>António Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas Moniz (29 November 1874 – 13 December 1955), known as Egas Moniz (), was a Portuguese neurologist and the developer of cerebral angiography. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern psychosurgery, having developed the surgical procedure &quot;leucotomy&quot;better known today as &quot;lobotomy&quot;for which he became the first Portuguese national to receive a Nobel Prize in 1949 (shared with Walter Rudolf Hess).

He held academic positions, wrote many medical articles and also served in several legislative and diplomatic posts in the Portuguese government. In 1911, he became professor of neurology in Lisbon until his retirement in 1944.

== Early life and training ==
Moniz was born in Avanca, Estarreja, Portugal, as António Caetano de Abreu Freire de Resende. He attended Escola do Padre José Ramos and the Jesuit-run College of Saint Fidelis and studied medicine at the University of Coimbra, graduating in 1899. For the next 12 years, he served as a lecturer for basic medical courses at Coimbra. In 1911, he became a neurology professor at the University of Lisbon, where he worked until his retirement in 1944.

His uncle and godfather, Father Caetano de Pina Resende Abreu e Sá Freire, convinced his family to change his surname to Egas Moniz since he was convinced that the Resende family was descended from medieval nobleman Egas Moniz o Aio.

== Politics ==
Politics was an early passion for Moniz. He supported a republican government, diverging from his family&#x27;s support for the monarchy. As a student activist, he was jailed on two separate occasions for participating in demonstrations. While serving as Dean of the Medical School at the University of Lisbon, he was arrested a third time for preventing police from settling a student-run protest.

Moniz&#x27;s formal political career began when he was elected to parliament in 1900. During World War I, he was appointed the Ambassador to Spain, and afterward, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1917, and in 1918 led the Portuguese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. He retired from politics in 1919 following a duel resulting from a political quarrel.

== Research ==
=== Cerebral angiography ===

In 1926, at age 51, Moniz returned to medicine full-time. He hypothesized that visualizing blood vessels in the brain with radiographic means would allow for more precise localization of brain tumors. During his experiments, Moniz injected radiopaque dyes into brain arteries and took X-rays to visualize abnormalities. In his initial tests, Moniz used strontium and lithium bromide in three patients with a suspected tumor, epilepsy, and Parkinsonism, but the experiment failed and one patient died. After a set of trials in rabbits, dogs, and cadaver heads, he achieved success using 25% sodium iodide solution on three patients, developing the first cerebral angiogram.

Moniz presented his findings at the Neurological Society in Paris and the French Academy of Medicine in 1927. He was the first person to successfully visualize the brain using radiopaque substances, as previous scientists had only visualized peripheral structures. He also contributed to the development of Thorotrast for use in the procedure and delivered many lectures and papers on the subject. His work led to the use of angiography to detect internal carotid occlusion, as well as two Nobel Prize nominations in this area.

=== Prefrontal leucotomy ===
Moniz thought that mental illness originated from abnormal neural connections in the frontal lobe. He described a &quot;fixation of synapses,&quot; which in mental illness, was expressed as &quot;predominant, obsessive ideas.&quot; Moniz also referenced the experiments of Yale physiologists John Farquhar Fulton and C.F. Jacobsen, who found that removing the frontal lobes of a chimpanzee made it calmer and more cooperative. In addition, Moniz observed &quot;changes in character and personality&quot; among soldiers who had had injuries to their frontal lobes.

Moniz hypothesized that surgically removing white matter fibers from the frontal lobe would improve a patient&#x27;s mental illness. He enlisted his long-time staff member and neurosurgeon Pedro Almeida Lima to test the procedure on a group of 20 patients, mainly with schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. The surgeries took place under general anesthesia. The first psychosurgery was performed in 1935 on a 63-year-old woman with depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and insomnia. The patient experienced a rapid physical recovery, and two months later, a psychiatrist noted that she was calmer, less paranoid, and well oriented. In the first set of surgeries, Moniz reported a total of seven cures, seven improvements, and six unchanged cases.

Moniz never performed a surgery himself, partially because of his lack of neurosurgical training but also because he had limited use of his hands as a complication of gout. Instructed by Moniz, Lima performed ten of the first twenty surgeries by injecting absolute alcohol to destroy the frontal lobe. Later on, Moniz and Lima developed a new technique using a leucotome, a needle-like instrument with a retractable wire loop. By rotating the wire loop, they were able to surgically separate white matter fibres.

Moniz judged the results acceptable in the first 40 or so patients he treated, claiming, &quot;Prefrontal leukotomy is a simple operation, always safe, which may prove to be an effective surgical treatment in certain cases of mental disorder.&quot; He also claimed that any behavioral and personality deterioration that may occur was outweighed by reduction in the debilitating effects of the illness. He conceded that patients who had already deteriorated from the mental illness did not benefit much. The procedure enjoyed a brief vogue, and in 1949 he received the Nobel Prize &quot;for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses.&quot;

Critics accused Moniz of understating complications, providing inadequate documentation, and not following up with patients. After his initial procedures, other physicians, such as Walter Jackson Freeman II and James W. Watts, adopted a modified technique in the United States and renamed it &quot;lobotomy.&quot;

== Writing ==
Moniz was a prolific writer, publishing work in Portuguese literature, sexology, and two autobiographies. Upon graduating from medical school, he gained notoriety for publishing a series of controversial books, called &quot;A Vida Sexual&quot; (The Sexual Life). His other writings included biographies of Portuguese physician Pedro Hispano Portucalense and José Custódio de Faria, a monk and hypnotist. In the field of medicine, Moniz published 112 articles and 2 books on angiography alone. He also wrote on neurological war injuries, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and clinical neurology.

== Later life and death ==
In 1939, Moniz was shot multiple times by a patient with schizophrenia.
He continued in private practice until 1955. Moniz died from an internal haemorrhage on 13 December 1955.

==Legacy==

After Moniz&#x27;s death, antipsychotic medications were developed and put into use and leucotomies fell out of favour. Moniz&#x27;s legacy suffered towards the end of the 20th century, as leucotomies were then perceived overwhelmingly negatively, thought of as an outdated experimental procedure. Well-known experts, including Psychologist Elliot Valenstein, and Neurologist Oliver Sacks, were particularly critical of Moniz&#x27;s methods and him earning the Nobel Prize.

There have been calls to rescind Moniz&#x27;s Nobel Prize, especially from family members of patients who underwent leucotomies. However, others have defended Moniz for his scientific contributions, stressing the need to examine his legacy in context.

In his native Portugal, Moniz is highly regarded, being featured on commemorative banknotes and postage stamps. A statue of him stands outside the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon, and his country house in Avanca is now a museum.

In 2020, a biographical made-for-television film was produced by RTP2 titled &quot;O Ego de Egas&quot; (&quot;The Ego of Egas&quot;), which explores Moniz&#x27;s work and motives.

<doc id="694837" wikidata="Q4651169" url="?curid=694837" title="Jesse Haines">
<text>Jesse Joseph Haines (July 22, 1893 – August 5, 1978), nicknamed &quot;Pop&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). After a lengthy stint in minor league baseball, he played briefly in 1918, then from 1920 to 1937. He spent nearly his entire major league career with the Cardinals. Haines pitched on three World Series championship teams. Though he had a kind personality off the field, Haines was known as a fiery competitor during games.

After retiring in 1937 with a 210–158 win–loss record, Haines was a coach with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938. He left baseball after that season and returned to his native Ohio. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970. In 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He ranks second in franchise history in shutouts.

==Early life==
Haines was born in Clayton, Ohio, but he grew up in nearby Phillipsburg, where he attended local schools. His father Elias worked as an auctioneer. Haines wanted to play baseball for the local team in Phillipsburg. His parents did not approve of him playing baseball on Sundays, so Haines used to sneak away, hiding his uniform in a corn crib and changing clothes in a cornfield. He left town to play semipro baseball in Dayton in 1912. Soon thereafter, he was signed to play for a minor league team in Dayton.

Spending several seasons in minor league baseball, Haines also pitched for teams in Saginaw, Fort Wayne, Springfield (Springfield Reapers), Topeka and Tulsa. He had played briefly in the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds in 1918, but he returned to the minor leagues. Across his minor league career, he compiled a 107–61 record and 1.93 ERA over 187 games.

Branch Rickey of the St. Louis Cardinals noticed Haines while he was pitching in Kansas City, but the team was struggling with money. He convinced a group of the team&#x27;s stockholders to take out a $10,000 loan for the purchase of Haines&#x27;s contract.

During his minor league days, Haines married Carrie M. Weidner. They had one child.

==Major league career==
Haines became a fixture in the Cardinals starting rotation in 1920. Despite a 13–20 record, he pitched 301 innings, the highest output of his career, and recorded a 2.98 earned run average (ERA).

Author Paul Doutrich writes that while Haines was a mild-mannered individual, he had no patience for losing games and &quot;became a raging bull when on the mound.&quot; Haines threw a no-hitter on July 17, 1924, against the Boston Braves; more than 50 years passed before a St. Louis pitcher threw another no-hitter at home.

Haines pitched on three World Series championship teams, winning two games in the 1926 World Series. In game seven of that series, Haines developed a bleeding blister and had to be removed from the game with the bases loaded in the seventh inning. Grover Cleveland Alexander was inserted into the game and struck out Tony Lazzeri.

As his career went on, Haines became known as &quot;Pop&quot; because of the influence he exerted on younger teammates. His use of the knuckleball allowed him to extend his career after his other pitches became ineffective. Unlike other knuckleball pitchers who gripped the pitch with their fingertips, Haines actually held the ball with his knuckles, throwing it as hard as he could.

Haines began to pitch fewer games in 1932. By 1936, manager Frankie Frisch thought that Haines had become too old and held him out of any games until May. However, he got more opportunities that year as the St. Louis pitching staff struggled with injuries. By June, he made relief pitching appearances three days in a row.

He retired in 1937, having pitched to the age of 43. He won 20 games or more three times for the Cardinals and won three World Series championships (1926, 1931, and 1934), though he did not pitch in the 1931 series. In the 1926 World Series against the Yankees, he went 2–0 with a 1.08 ERA. He retired with a 210–158 record, 981 strikeouts, 3.64 ERA, and 3208 innings pitched.

==Later life==

Haines worked on the coaching staff of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938. After that, he was an auditor for almost 30 years in Montgomery County, Ohio.

After failing to gain more than 8.3% of the votes for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame over a 12-year period, Haines was voted in by the Veterans Committee in 1970. Frankie Frisch, a member of the VC, also shepherded the selections of his teammates Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. After the committee selected Haines, Frisch commented that Haines was &quot;a worthy, worthy man... a great competitor, a fine fellow off and on the field.&quot; Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Haines as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor.

He died in 1978 in Dayton, Ohio after a 28-year career as Montgomery County (Ohio) Assessor. His grave in Clayton, Ohio, which incorporates the sundial that the Cardinals gave Haines upon his retirement, has become a local attraction.

==Legacy==

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Haines among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

<text>Moniz is a surname in the Portuguese language, namely in Portugal and Brazil. It is believed to derive from a Gothic, or Gascon given names Munnius, Monio, Munino, Monnio, and Munnio used in the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages. 
It is uncertain whether the Galician and Asturian &#x27;Muñiz&#x27; or &#x27;Muniz&#x27; surnames are in any way related with Moniz. The Portuguese variants of the medieval name were Munio, Monio and Moninho, making Moniz (son of Moninho or Munio) a patronymic surname. It may refer to:

*António Egas Moniz (1874–1955), Portuguese physician, neurologist and Nobel Prize laureate
*Bryant Moniz, quarterback for the University of Hawaii Warriors football team

White began his career in journalism at the &quot;Reading Evening Post&quot; (1966–71) and after a spell at London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (1970–71) he moved to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he worked as a sub/feature writer (1971–74), diary writer (1974–76), political correspondent and sketchwriter (1976–84) and Washington correspondent from 1984. He became the newspaper&#x27;s political editor in 1990, succeeding Ian Aitken; he relinquished the position to Patrick Wintour at the beginning of 2006. He retired from his &quot;Guardian&quot; positions in October 2016. In 2003, he was voted Print Journalist of the Year by MPs and Peers in &quot;The House&quot;/BBC Parliamentary Awards.

He is a regular commentator on the BBC, introducing newspaper reviews and commenting on everything from &quot;Newsnight&quot; to &quot;Breakfast News&quot;, &quot;BBC News Channel&quot; and &quot;Question Time&quot;. He has also appeared on BBC Radio 4, introducing a programme on political insults, &quot;Savaged by a Dead Sheep&quot;.

White retired from &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2016 after almost 45 years at the paper. He wrote a regular column for the &quot;Health Service Journal&quot; from 1977 to 2017.

==Political views==
Despite being a Labour Party supporter, White has not always had the easiest of relationships with Labour and its leading figures. In November 1991, following the death of &quot;Mirror&quot; owner Robert Maxwell, he was involved in a physical altercation with the title&#x27;s political editor Alastair Campbell, later Director of Communications for Tony Blair, over White&#x27;s use of the &quot;Cap&#x27;n Bob, Bob, Bob&quot; refrain.

In February 2006, White detailed the changing attitudes of the Labour Party to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He wrote that the Blair government changed its attitude to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, from hostility towards grudging friendship as the government lost &quot;fair weather friends&quot; on other papers. &quot;It is no secret in the office, for example, that I think its coverage of the protracted crisis over Iraq since 2003, has not always been fair to Blair&#x27;s position&quot;, he wrote. Regarding the Israel–Palestine conflict, in July 2006 he wrote that over time his sympathies are shifting back to Israel &quot;however short-sighted and self-defeating some of its actions are&quot;.

White, in discussing media self-censorship in March 2011, said, &quot;I have always sensed liberal, middle class ill-ease in going after stories about immigration, legal or otherwise, about welfare fraud or the less attractive tribal habits of the working class, which is more easily ignored altogether. Toffs, including royal ones, Christians, especially popes, governments of Israel, and US Republicans are more straightforward targets.&quot;

White has argued against some gay rights, including gay adoption and same-sex marriage.

<doc id="694843" wikidata="Q4143007" url="?curid=694843" title="Alexander–Spanier cohomology">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology, Alexander–Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory for topological spaces.

==History==
It was introduced by for the special case of compact metric spaces, and by for all topological spaces, based on a suggestion of Alexander D. Wallace.

==Definition==
If &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and &quot;G&quot; is an &quot;R&quot; module where &quot;R&quot; is a ring with unity, then there is a cochain complex &quot;C&quot; whose &quot;p&quot;-th term formula_1 is the set of all functions from formula_2 to &quot;G&quot; with differential formula_3 given by

:formula_4

The defined cochain complex formula_5 does not rely on the topology of formula_6. In fact, if formula_6 is a nonempty space, formula_8 where formula_9 is a graded module whose only nontrivial module is formula_9 at degree 0.

An element formula_11 is said to be &quot;locally zero&quot; if there is a covering formula_12 of formula_6 by open sets such that formula_14 vanishes on any formula_15-tuple of formula_6 which lies in some element of formula_12 (i.e. formula_14 vanishes on formula_19).
The subset of formula_20 consisting of locally zero functions is a submodule, denote by formula_21.
formula_22 is a cochain subcomplex of formula_23 so we define a quotient cochain complex formula_24.
The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups formula_25 are defined to be the cohomology groups of formula_26.

===Induced homomorphism===
Given a function formula_27 which is not necessarily continuous, there is an induced cochain map

:formula_28

defined by formula_29

If formula_30 is continuous, there is an induced cochain map
:formula_31

===Relative cohomology module===
If formula_32 is a subspace of formula_6 and formula_34 is an inclusion map, then there is an induced epimorphism formula_35. The kernel of formula_36 is a cochain subcomplex of formula_37 which is denoted by formula_38. If formula_39 denote the subcomplex of formula_23 of functions formula_14 that are locally zero on formula_32, then formula_43.

The &quot;relative module&quot; is formula_44 is defined to be the cohomology module of formula_38.

formula_46 is called the &quot;Alexander cohomology module of formula_47 of degree formula_48 with coefficients formula_9&quot; and this module satisfies all cohomology axioms. The resulting cohomology theory is called the &quot;Alexander (or Alexander-Spanier) cohomology theory&quot;

==Cohomology theory axioms==
* (Dimension axiom) If formula_6 is a one-point space, formula_51
* (Exactness axiom) If formula_47 is a topological pair with inclusion maps formula_34 and formula_54, there is an exact sequence formula_55
* (Excision axiom) For topological pair formula_47, if formula_57 is an open subset of formula_6 such that formula_59, then formula_60.
* (Homotopy axiom) If formula_61 are homotopic, then formula_62

==Alexander cohomology with compact supports==
A subset formula_63 is said to be &quot;cobounded&quot; if formula_64 is bounded, i.e. its closure is compact.

Similar to the definition of Alexander cohomology module, one can define Alexander cohomology module with &quot;compact supports&quot; of a pair formula_47 by adding the property that formula_66 is locally zero on some cobounded subset of formula_6.

Formally, one can define as follows : For given topological pair formula_47, the submodule formula_69 of formula_70 consists of formula_66 such that formula_14 is locally zero on some cobounded subset of formula_6.

Similar to the Alexander cohomology module, one can get a cochain complex formula_74 and a cochain complex formula_75.

The cohomology module induced from the cochain complex formula_76 is called the &quot;Alexander cohomology of formula_47 with compact supports&quot; and denoted by formula_78. Induced homomorphism of this cohomology is defined as the Alexander cohomology theory.

Under this definition, we can modify &quot;homotopy axiom&quot; for cohomology to a &quot;proper homotopy axiom&quot; if we define a coboundary homomorphism formula_79 only when formula_80 is a &quot;closed&quot; subset. Similarly, &quot;excision axiom&quot; can be modified to &quot;proper excision axiom&quot; i.e. the excision map is a proper map.

===Property===
One of the most important property of this Alexander cohomology module with compact support is the following theorem:
* If formula_6 is a locally compact Hausdorff space and formula_82 is the one-point compactification of formula_6, then there is an isomorphism formula_84

===Example===
:formula_85
as formula_86. Hence if formula_87, formula_88 and formula_89 are not of the same &quot;proper&quot; homotopy type.

==Relation with tautness==
*From the fact that a closed subspace of a paracompact Hausdorff space is a taut subspace relative to the Alexander cohomology theory and the first &quot;Basic property&quot; of tautness, if formula_90 where formula_6 is a paracompact Hausdorff space and formula_32 and formula_93 are closed subspaces of formula_6, then formula_95 is taut pair in formula_6 relative to the Alexander cohomology theory.

Using this tautness property, one can show the following two facts:
* (&quot;Strong excision property&quot;) Let formula_47 and formula_98 be pairs with formula_6 and formula_100 paracompact Hausdorff and formula_32 and formula_93 closed. Let formula_103 be a closed continuous map such that formula_30 induces a one-to-one map of formula_105 onto formula_106. Then for all formula_48 and all formula_9, formula_109
* (&quot;Weak continuity property&quot;) Let formula_110 be a family of compact Hausdorff pairs in some space, directed downward by inclusion, and let formula_111. The inclusion maps formula_112 induce an isomorphism
*:formula_113.

==Difference from singular cohomology theory==
Recall that the singular cohomology module of a space is the direct product of the singular cohomology modules of its path components.

A nonempty space formula_6 is connected if and only if formula_115. Hence for any connected space which is not path connected, singular cohomology and Alexander cohomology differ in degree 0.

If formula_116 is an open covering of formula_6 by pairwise disjoint sets, then there is a natural isomorphism formula_118. In particular, if formula_119 is the collection of components of a locally connected space formula_6, there is a natural isomorphism formula_121.

===Variants===
It is also possible to define Alexander–Spanier homology and Alexander–Spanier cohomology with compact supports. 

==Connection to other cohomologies==
The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups coincide with Čech cohomology groups for compact Hausdorff spaces, and coincide with singular cohomology groups for locally finite complexes.

<text>The Roanoke River ( ) runs long through southern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina in the United States. A major river of the southeastern United States, it drains a largely rural area of the coastal plain from the eastern edge of the Appalachian Mountains southeast across the Piedmont to Albemarle Sound. An important river throughout the history of the United States, it was the site of early settlement in the Virginia Colony and the Carolina Colony. An section of its lower course in Virginia between the Leesville Lake and Kerr Lake is known as the Staunton River, pronounced , as is the Shenandoah Valley city of that name. It is impounded along much of its middle course to form a chain of reservoirs.

Staunton River is also the name of the northern political district of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, where a large section of the river serves as the boundary between Campbell County, Virginia (to the north) and Pittsylvania County (to the south).

The Roanoke River State Trail is a paddle trail which follows the lower portion of the river, from Roanoke Rapids to the Albemarle Sound.

==Description==
The river has its headwaters in the Blue Ridge Mountains in southwestern Virginia at Lafayette in Montgomery County where the North Fork and South Fork of the river merge. The North Fork, approximately long, rises between two mountain ridges and flows initially southwest, then loops back to the northeast. The South Fork, approximately long, rises in several streams in the mountains on the border of Floyd, Roanoke, and Montgomery counties and flows generally north, joining the North Fork from the south.

The combined stream flows northeast between mountain ridges through the Roanoke Valley, approximately to Salem, then east through the city of Roanoke, emerging from a gorge in the Blue Ridge Mountains southeast of Roanoke and forming the boundary between Franklin and Bedford counties. The river flows generally east-southeast across the Piedmont of southern Virginia and enters northeastern North Carolina, passing north of Roanoke Rapids at the fall line. The river flows southeast in a zigzag course across the coastal plain through the Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge and then briefly turns north as it enters Batchelor Bay on the western end of Albemarle Sound. The Roanoke River is also known as the Staunton River for 80 miles between Smith Mountain Lake and convergence with the Dan River at Kerr Lake.

The river is impounded in six locations. The first is the Niagara Dam just south of the City of Roanoke in Roanoke County adjacent to the town of Vinton. It was constructed in 1906 to supply power for the Roanoke Electric Car streetcar system, and is currently owned and operated by Appalachian Power. It is then impounded twice in succession in the Piedmont of southwestern Virginia downstream from Roanoke to form the Smith Mountain Lake and Leesville Lake reservoirs. Farther downstream in southern along the North Carolina border, the river is impounded by the John H. Kerr Dam to form the expansive Kerr Lake. In northeastern North Carolina, west of Roanoke Rapids, the river is impounded to form the Lake Gaston reservoir, and is impounded a final time to form Roanoke Rapids Lake.

==History==

The Roanoke River valley was the homeland of various Native Americans, mostly Virginia Siouan, such as the Occaneechi (today part of the Haliwa-Saponi) and the Tutelo. The name Roanoke is derived from &quot;rawrenok&quot;, an Algonquian word for wampum. The deadly spring floods earned it the name &quot;River of Death&quot;. The river&#x27;s lower course began to be settled by Virginians about the middle of the 17th century, in what was known as the Albemarle Settlements. The upper reaches of the Roanoke River were explored by fur trading parties sent by Abraham Wood in the late 17th century, but these were not settled by English until the early 18th century.

In 1883, the small town of Big Lick on the river was selected as a major shops and terminal point for the new Norfolk and Western Railway to meet the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Big Lick was renamed Roanoke for the river that bisected it, as the surrounding Roanoke County had been in 1838.

The Roanoke River was prone to serious flooding prior to the completion of the John H. Kerr Dam in 1953. Construction of the dam was precipitated by the 1940 South Carolina hurricane, which caused record flooding in the Roanoke River basin and led to calls for better flood control mechanisms.

In 1997, the non-profit Roanoke River Partners formed to create a paddle trail along the river in North Carolina. The group established a system of river accesses and camping platforms between Roanoke Rapids and the Albemarle Sound, known as the Roanoke River Paddle Trail.

On November 18, 2021, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law adding the Roanoke River Paddle Trail as its twelfth State Trail.

<text>Kannagi (), sometimes spelled Kannaki, is a legendary Tamil woman who forms the central character of the Tamil epic &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;. Kannagi is described as a chaste woman who stays with her husband despite his adultery, their attempt to rebuild their marriage after her unrepentant husband had lost everything, how he is framed then punished without the due checks and processes of justice. Kannagi proves and protests the injustice, then curses the king and city of Madurai, leading to the death of the unjust Pandyan king of Madurai, who had wrongfully put her husband Kovalan to death. The society that made her suffer then endures retribution as the city Madurai, in consequence, is burnt to the ground because of her curse.

In Tamil folklore, Kannagi has been deified as the symbol – sometimes as a goddess – of chastity, with sculptures or reliefs in Hindu temples iconographically reminding the visitor of her breaking her anklet or tearing her bleeding breast and throwing it at the city.
==Text==
The Kannagi story first appears in the Sangam era poem &quot;Narrinai 312&quot;. A more extended version appears in the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;.
==Legend==

Kannagi was the daughter of the merchant and ship captain Manayakan from Puhar. She marries the son of Macattuvan, Kovalan, whose family were sea traders and had the sea goddess Manimekalai as patron deity. Later, Kovalan met a dancer Madhavi and had an affair with her, which prompted him to spend all his wealth on the dancer. At last, penniless, Kovalan realized his mistake and returned to his wife, Kannagi. Kovalan hoped to recoup his fortunes by trading in Madurai and selling the precious anklet of Kannagi.

Madurai was ruled by the Pandyan king Neṭuñceḻiyaṉ I. When Kovalan tried to sell the anklet, it was mistaken for a stolen anklet of the queen. Kovalan was accused of having stolen the anklet and was immediately beheaded by the king without trial. When Kannagi was informed of this, she became furious, and set out to prove her husband&#x27;s innocence to the king.

Kannagi came to the king&#x27;s court, broke open the anklet seized from Kovalan and showed that it contained rubies, as opposed to the queen&#x27;s anklets which contained pearls. Realizing the error, the king committed suicide in shame, after having caused such a huge miscarriage of justice. Kannagi uttered a curse that the entire city of Madurai be burnt. The capital city of the Pandyas was set ablaze, resulting in huge losses. However, at the request of the goddess Meenakshi, she calmed down and later attained salvation. The story forms the crux of the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;.

==Worship==

As &quot;Kannaki Amman&quot;, she is eulogized as the epitome of chastity and is worshiped as a goddess in select regions. She is worshiped as a goddess Pattini in Sri Lanka in Sinhalese Buddhism, and as Kannaki Amman by the Sri Lankan Tamil people, and as Kodungallur Bhagavati and Attukal Bhagavati in the South Indian state of Kerala. Keralites believe Kannaki to be an incarnation of the goddess Bhadrakali, who reached Kodungallur and attained salvation in the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple.

=== Tamil Nadu ===
the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Maṇimēkalai&quot;, offer evidence that Kannaki was praised as a goddess even during the lifetime of Maṇimēkalai, the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi. Cilappatikāram tells about the Kannaki worship of another Pandyan King &quot;Vetrivel Cheliyan&quot;, for relieving the land from the drought and curse of her on Pandya Nadu.

Kannaki Amman&#x27;s worship involves her identification with the Dravidian folk religion&#x27;s rain goddess, Mariamman. Cilappatikāram states that Mariamman is none other than Kannaki by stating that Kannaki burnt Madurai on the Friday of the Ādi month. which is identified as the month of Mariamman&#x27;s veneration in Tamil Nadu.

However, several temples, like Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvottiyur, still commemorate the goddess as Kannaki Amman. Mathura Kaliamman Temple, Siruvachur and the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple in Idukki district are the other few temples where their connection with Kannaki is still remembered.

=== Kerala ===
The Kannaki cult, perhaps initiated by the Chera dynasty of Kerala, is still preserved in the form of the Bhagavati cult. The famous Bhagavati Temple at Kodungallur, which was the former capital of Cheras, remembers its ancient interaction with the Kannaki cult in its Sthala Puranam. Though the deity of the temple is still observed as Bhadra Kali, she is often praised by the devotees as Kannaki and Muthumari in Kodungallur.

Attukal Bhagavati Temple, Moothanthara Karnaki Amman Temple and so many Goddess Bhagavati temples are believed to be located on the journey of Kannaki to Chera Nadu (Kerala) after the burning of Madurai.

=== Sri Lanka ===

According to folklore, after the burning of Madurai, Kannagi traveled to Kerala and eventually arrived at the island of Pungudutheevu, near the ancient Manipallavam, now known as Nainativu. She visited approximately 25 sites in Sri Lanka, mostly along the east coast, and finally reached Vattapalai. Disguised as an old woman, she asked some boys herding buffaloes for food. They offered her Pongal made from buffalo milk instead of cow milk. She then requested a lamp lit with sea water. The boys, fearing she was a witch, sought help from the village. When the villagers arrived, Kannagi asked one of the boys to comb her hair, revealing a miraculous sight of 1,000 eyes in her head. She then ascended to heaven, declaring herself as Kannagi of Poompuhar and instructed the villagers to perform the same ritual each year on the day of Vaikasi. This tradition continues today, with both Sinhalese and Tamils participating in the festival by offering Pongal and lighting sea water lamps. King Gajabahu I recognized Kannagi as Pattini, making her a guardian deity of Sri Lanka for both communities.
==== Tamil Hindus ====
Sri Lankan beliefs on Kannaki are intermediate to Cilappatikāram and common Sri Lankan Beliefs. Eastern Sri Lankan and Vanni Tamils praises her as &quot;Kannakai Amman&quot;. There are so many evidences in Yalpana Vaipava Malai, chronicle of Jaffna Kingdom confirms that Kannaki was also popular during the rule of the Aryacakravarti dynasty (1215–1624) in Northern Sri Lanka. The author of the Sri Lankan epic on Kannaki equivalent to the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;, the &quot;Kannaki Vaḻakkurai&quot;, recited in eastern Kannaki Amman temples, is believed to be written by the Jaffna king Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan (1380–1410).

The Kannagi cult was especially popular among the coastal folk who considered her as their guardian deity since she was the daughter of a rich sea trader of Kaveripattinam. Since most of the coastal folk were converted to Catholicism during the Portuguese rule, most of the Kannaki shrines became churches of &quot;Our Lady&quot;. The remaining temples of Kannaki were transformed into Agamic Raja Rajeshwari and Bhuvaneshvari Temples as Kannaki was considered as a ln incarnation of Shakti by the activists of Saiva movement of 19th Century in Jaffna in the leadership of Navalar.

Kannaki is mainly praised once in a year during the Vaikasi month (May–June) of Tamil Calendar in Batticaloa and Ampara Districts. The Festival is called Catangu and Katavu Tirattal. &quot;Kalyanak Kāl Naduthal&quot; (Planting Wedding Pillar), &quot;Vaḻakkurai Pāduthal&quot; (Reciting the verses of &quot;Kannaki Vaḻkkurai&quot;), Kulirthi Paaduthal (&quot;Singing Cooling verses&quot;) are common rituals of the festival. The festival days differ from temple to temple from three days to seven days. At the end of the festival, the sanctum of Kannaki temple is closed and it will be only opened when the nest Cadangu begins.

==== Sinhalese Buddhists ====
Although the hierophant of Kannaki is fully transformed into the Bhagavati and Mariamman cult in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, respectively, Sri Lanka still preserves the Kannaki cult in its own form. The [Sinhalese praise her as Pattini. Their stories of that goddess also differ from those of the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; and see her as an avatar of the Buddha. She was born as a mango in the garden of the Pandyan king. She was neglected by him and kept in a boat at sea and grew up in Chola country. She eventually slew the evil Pandyan king and was hired as one of the guardian gods of Lanka by the Buddha.

The grant festival of Sri Lanka, the Esala Perahera, initially included only Kannaki, Vishnu, Kataragama, and Natha. The holy tooth relic of Buddha was annexed in the procession during the period of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy Kingdom. (1747 - 1782) according to the request of Upali Thera, a Buddhist monk from Konbaung Burma.

&quot;Polkeliya&quot; &quot;coconut fight&quot;, &quot;Gammaduwa&quot; &quot;village rituals&quot;, and &quot;ankeliya&quot; &quot;horn play&quot; are the main three aspects of the Pattini cult. There are well-known devales at Kandy, Nawagamuwa and Panama for Pattini Deviyo.

==In popular culture==

A Tamil epic film &quot;Kannagi&quot; directed by R. S. Mani released in 1942. This was the first Tamil film based on the epic Silapadhigaaram.

A similar movie named &quot;Poompuhar&quot; released in 1964.

A Malayalam film &quot;Kodungallooramma&quot; directed by Kunchacko starring Prem Nazir, K. R. Vijaya, Adoor Bhasi and Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair was released in 1968.

A statue of Kannagi holding her anklet, depicting a scene from &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; was installed on Marina Beach, Chennai. It was removed in December 2001 citing reasons that it hindered traffic. The statue was reinstalled in June 2006.

A Sinhala film called &quot;Paththini&quot; was released on 5 May 2016 in Sri Lanka. The role of the goddess Paththni or Kannagi was played by Pooja Umashankar.

<text>Michael A. Ferguson (born July 22, 1970) is an American Republican Party politician who served as member of the United States House of Representatives representing New Jersey&#x27;s 7th congressional district from 2001 to 2009. Ferguson is now executive vice president at AT&amp;T and leader of the company&#x27;s federal legislative relations team.

==Life and early career==
Ferguson was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey. Ferguson is the son of Thomas Ferguson, former chairman and CEO of CommonHealth USA, a healthcare marketing and communications group. He attended the Delbarton School, the University of Notre Dame, and has an MPA from the Georgetown University. He attended the University of Notre Dame with punk musician Ted Leo, where it is claimed that he adhered to more left-leaning politics, voiced in the song &quot;The Anointed One&quot; off the album &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot;.

Before running for Congress he worked as a teacher at a private school, and worked as a part-time as an instructor at a community college.

==Congressional career==

Ferguson was the Republican nominee for 6th Congressional District in 1998, but lost to Democratic incumbent Frank Pallone. In 1999, Ferguson moved to the more Republican 7th district, where incumbent Bob Franks was retiring to run for the United States Senate. Ferguson defeated Thomas Kean Jr. and future West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the primary. He faced a difficult general election campaign against the Democratic candidate, former Fanwood mayor Maryanne Connelly but narrowly won, receiving 50% of the vote. At 30 years old, Ferguson was the youngest member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation.

Ferguson initially was a Member of the House Financial Services Committee, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the Small Business Committee. Early in his career he played an active role in committee hearings on corporate accounting scandals at Enron and Worldcom, and cosponsored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. He also served on the House–Senate conference committee which produced the first terrorism risk insurance law in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

In his second term, Ferguson joined the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where he served as Vice Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, and also served on the Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. During his time on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Ferguson became a key Republican Member on health care issues broadly and a champion for the life sciences industry which employed large numbers of his constituents. This included working with his colleagues to ensure passage of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.

In 2002 and 2004, Ferguson defeated challenges from Democrats Tim Carden and Steve Brozak by comparatively large margins.

In 2005, citing his family&#x27;s own experience in providing care to his mother as she fought cancer, Ferguson sponsored the Lifespan Respite Care Act, which authorized $289 million in grants to states to train volunteers and provide respite care services to sick and elderly family members or children with special needs. President George W. Bush signed Ferguson&#x27;s legislation into law December 21, 2006.

In 2006, Ferguson won reelection in a tight race with Democratic state legislator Linda Stender. Stender attempted to portray him as too conservative for the district and tie him with President Bush, who was extremely unpopular at the time in New Jersey. The 7th district had a slight Republican lean, and Stender won the more liberal suburban counties of Middlesex and Union. Ferguson managed to win reelection by winning large margins in the more conservative areas in Somerset and Hunterdon counties, and holding Stender to only a small lead in Union. Overall, he defeated Stender by just over 3,000 votes and a margin of less than 2 percentage points.

Ferguson announced on November 19, 2007, that he would not run for re-election in 2008, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family. He was succeeded by fellow Republican Leonard Lance, a state senator. Ferguson and his wife Maureen have five children.

Ferguson was the recipient of the 2005 Outstanding Legislator of the Year award from the New Jersey Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 2006 Legislator of the Year Award from the National Visiting Nurses Association, and the 2007 Congressional Award from the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.

Overall, Ferguson&#x27;s voting record was moderate by national Republican standards, as is typical of Republicans from New Jersey. He was known as a social conservative and staunch advocate for anti-abortion causes, obtaining a 100% rating by the National Right to Life Committee.

==Post-congressional career==

Upon his retirement from Congress effective January 3, 2009, Ferguson became chairman and CEO of Ferguson Strategies LLC, a government affairs and strategic business consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. The firm provided services to Fortune 100 companies as well as start-ups, with an emphasis on health care and life sciences as well as financial services and energy.

Ferguson co-chaired New Jersey Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s victorious 2009 campaign, and after the election served as Chairman of the Treasury Subcommittee for Christie&#x27;s transition team. Christie later nominated Ferguson to be a board member of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority; Ferguson&#x27;s nomination was approved March 10, 2011, by the Democratic-controlled New Jersey Senate Judiciary Committee and March 21, 2011, by the full Senate.

Ferguson is also a senior fellow at the non-profit Center for Medicine in the Public Interest.

In 2016, Ferguson joined the law firm BakerHostetler as a senior advisor and leader of the firm&#x27;s Federal Policy team.

In 2022, Ferguson joined AT&amp;T as executive vice president of federal legislative relations, where he is responsible for managing the team that represents AT&amp;T before Congress, the White House, and executive branch departments.

<doc id="694859" wikidata="Q967616" url="?curid=694859" title="World Lacrosse Championship">
<text>The World Lacrosse Men&#x27;s Championship, formerly World Lacrosse Championship, is the international men&#x27;s field lacrosse championship organized by World Lacrosse that occurs every four years.

The WLC began before any international lacrosse organization had been formed. It started as a four-team invitational tournament which coincided with Canada&#x27;s centennial lacrosse celebration in 1967. Canada, the United States, Australia, and England participated. Seven years later, Australia celebrated its lacrosse centenary and another four-team invitational tournament was held between the same countries. After that tournament in 1974, the first international governing body for men&#x27;s lacrosse was formed, the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF). The ILF merged with the women&#x27;s governing body in 2008 to form the Federation of International Lacrosse, which changed its name to World Lacrosse in 2019.

The United States has won the championship most titles in eleven times. With 46 nations competing, the 2018 WLC in Israel was the largest tournament and was the first championship held outside of Australia, Canada, England or the United States.

The oldest world Lacrosse championship match was recorded on April 22, 1870, in Montreal. The Montreal Lacrosse club accepted a challenge vs the Caughnawaga Lacrosse team.

==Editions==
=== 2006 Championship ===
Canada defeated the United States 15–10 in the gold medal game of the 2006 World Championship in London, Ontario. Geoff Snider of Team Canada was named tournament MVP.

=== 2010 Championship ===
The 2010 WLC was held in Manchester, England from July 15 to 24. For the first time, a World Lacrosse Festival was sanctioned to run alongside the world championships.

With more nations entering, the Round Robin stage of the tournament featured 30 nations and was split into 7 divisions, considerably larger than ever before. The Iroquois Nationals were unable to participate because the host nation did not recognize the validity of passports issued by the Iroquois confederacy.

The United States defeated Canada 12–10 in the gold medal game to capture their ninth victory at the World Lacrosse Championship.

=== 2014 Championship ===

The 2014 WLC was held on July 10–19, 2014 in Commerce City, Colorado, at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park, home of the Colorado Rapids soccer team. 38 nations participated in over 142 games. The countries with the top six rankings - Australia, Canada, England, Iroquois, Japan, and the United States - competed in the Blue Division.

Belgium, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, and Uganda all competed in the event for the first time.

Canada defeated the United States 8–5 in the gold medal game to capture their third World Lacrosse Championship

=== 2018 Championship ===

The 2018 WLC was held on July 11–21, 2018 in Netanya, Israel, at Netanya Stadium and Wingate Institute. 46 nations participated in tournament games. The countries with the top six rankings - Australia, Canada, England, Iroquois, Scotland, and the United States - competed in the Blue Division.

United States defeated Canada in the gold medal game, dramatically scoring the controversial game-winning goal at the last second.

=== 2023 Championship ===

Originally, the championship was scheduled to be held in 2022 in Coquitlam, British Columbia, however due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the games were delayed to 2023 and moved to Los Angeles, California, but ultimately were relocated to San Diego, California.

The 2023 WLC was held from June 21–July 1, 2023. Pool games and placement games were held at San Diego State University&#x27;s SDSU Sports Deck and the University of San Diego&#x27;s Torero Stadium, while playoff games were held at SDSU&#x27;s Snapdragon Stadium. 30 nations participated in tournament games, marking both the first time qualifiers were used to determine tournament entry and the first time the number of competing teams decreased from the previous tournament.

The countries with the top five rankings - Australia, Canada, England, Haudenosaunee, and the United States - competed in Pool A.

After the tournament, the Philippines&#x27; standing was demoted to 30th (last place) due to the team&#x27;s failure to comply with eligibility requirements, the team initially finished in 15th place. 

== Championship hosts ==
Hosting responsibilities for the 12 championships from 1967 to 2014 were evenly divided between four countries, with the United States, Canada, Australia, and England each hosting three times.

The 2018 championship in Israel was the first time the tournament expanded beyond the traditional four hosts. For the 2018 edition, World Lacrosse had originally selected England in 2013, but English Lacrosse withdrew in 2017, citing “unacceptable financial risk”, and Israel was selected instead.

<doc id="694880" wikidata="Q2941587" url="?curid=694880" title="Second Battle of Springfield">
<text>The Second Battle of Springfield took place during the American Civil War on January 8, 1863, in Springfield, Missouri. It is sometimes known as The Battle of Springfield. (The First Battle of Springfield was fought on October 25, 1861, and there was also the better-known Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, fought nearby on August 10, 1861.) Fighting was urban and house-to-house, which was rare in the war.

==Prelude==
On December 31, 1862, three columns of cavalry under the command of Confederate Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke left Pocahontas, Arkansas and Lewisburg, Arkansas, and moved north on separate roads toward Missouri and the Union supply line. Marmaduke’s immediate objective was the destruction of the Union Army of the Frontier’s wagon trains and supply line between Rolla and Springfield. If successful, Marmaduke would cause elements of the Army of the Frontier to withdraw from Arkansas and pursue Marmaduke&#x27;s Division.

Marmaduke&#x27;s main column proceeded north through Forsyth, Missouri, where Marmaduke learned from scouts that the Union army&#x27;s major supply depot at Springfield was weakly defended. To clear the way for his Confederates, Marmaduke marched on Ozark, Missouri. The Union garrison stationed at Ozark withdrew and the Confederates burned its abandoned fort. A second column, commanded by Colonel Emmett MacDonald, destroyed the Union fort (&quot;Fort Lawrence&quot;) at Lawrence Mill on Beaver Creek, about ten miles (16 km) southwest of Ava. A dispatch to the third column under Colonel Joseph C. Porter directed Porter to join Marmaduke at Springfield rather than at Hartville. If everything went as planned, all three commands would converge on Springfield in an attempt to capture the city&#x27;s lightly defended warehouses of military supplies.

==Preparation==
Late in the afternoon of January 7, 1863, Federals from the Ozark garrison reached Springfield and informed the local commander, Brigadier General Egbert Brown, that a Confederate cavalry force, with an estimated strength somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000 men, was headed for Springfield. Having only 1343 veteran soldiers, Brown mulled over two options. He could destroy all of the Union Army of the Frontier&#x27;s winter supplies at Springfield and retreat, or he could defend the town. General Grant on December 23, 1862 had published a major censure of the Union commander and forces stationed at Holly Springs, Mississippi, which had participated in the disgraceful surrender of Grant&#x27;s Holly Springs supply depot. No doubt, Brown recalling this censure, had a strong reason to favor the defense of Springfield.

Brown&#x27;s subordinates favored the defense of the city also. The Fourth Military District&#x27;s commanding general, Colley B. Holland, immediately sent dispatches to the surrounding communities, calling the Enrolled Missouri Militia to active duty with orders to hurry to Springfield. Brown also ordered the removal of 50,000 rations from Springfield into Fort Number 1 and prepared for the burning of the armory in the event of defeat. Meanwhile, at Dr. Samuel Melcher&#x27;s suggestion, Captain Byron Carr mounted three cannon onto wagon wheels.

During the following morning, the Federals issued arms and ammunition to soldiers and civilians alike. Although Springfield was lightly garrisoned, it had one distinct advantage. It was surrounded by a network of four nearly completed earthen forts and a stockaded college building. Each of the five points commanded the high ground.

==Battle==
As the morning of January 8, 1863 dawned, two of the Confederate columns under Marmaduke approached Springfield from the south. Since Porter&#x27;s and MacDonald&#x27;s columns had yet to arrive, Marmaduke occupied the early morning with foraging and capturing some of the Enrolled Missouri Militia about five miles (8 km) from Springfield. With MacDonald finally present by 10:00 a.m., the Confederates dismounted two regiments about three miles (5 km) from Springfield and advanced to feel out the Union lines and develop their strength. After the Confederates had pushed two Union Missouri State Militia Cavalry Regiments two miles (3 km) north, the smoking ruins of burning homes on the outskirts of Springfield came into view. To provide an unobstructed view for his artillery inside Fort No. 4 (located on the east side of South Avenue between Elm and Cherry Streets), Brown at the last minute ordered ten homes burned along South Avenue.

Colonel Joseph Orville Shelby took command of the tactical operations, launching piecemeal assaults upon the Union center and west flank. The Confederates advanced over open ground against Fort Number 4, seeking such shelter as they could get from tree stumps, piles of rock, and the charred remains of the homes burned by the Union forces. Despite repeated efforts, the assault on the fort failed.

Shelby then resolved to take Springfield by an oblique attack from the west. The Confederates were drawn by the cover offered by a ravine that led uphill toward town from what is now the intersection of Grand Avenue and Grant Street. At the head of this draw stood a two-story brick academy surrounded by a stockade. Used by the Federals as a prison, it stood near the northwest corner of what is now the intersection of Campbell Avenue and State Street. The Union forces failed to garrison the college stockade, so the Confederates were able to seize the building easily and use it as their own fortress to return the fire from Fort No. 4. However, heavy fighting soon erupted around the stockade as the Union forces attempted to retake the college and stockade. The Confederates found a local advantage in numbers and pressed their own attack. This phase of the assault saw the most severe casualties, hand-to-hand fighting, and the capture of a cannon by the Confederates. Union troops on the west flank also were pushed back to College Street from their original position along the Old Wire Road and State Street. But Union reinforcements halted the Confederate drive and even pushed back the Confederates to the vicinity of State Street.

With the sun sinking, Marmaduke launched a final assault against Fort No. 4. The Union forces again repelled the attack. As night fell, the Confederates withdrew down the Ozark Road to the Phelps farm (now Phelps Grove Park). The Battle of Springfield had ended, and the Union supply depot was safe.

==Aftermath==
Of the approximately 2,099 Union troops engaged, 19 were killed or missing and 146 were wounded for a total loss of 165 men (7.9 Percent). Two months later the total killed would reach 30, the missing in action would stand at 6, and 195 had been wounded. Of the approximately 1,870 Confederate troops present, at least 45 were killed or missing and 105 were wounded for a total loss of at least 150 men (8.0 percent). Marmaduke admitted that the Confederate returns were incomplete. Author Frederick Goman uses several period reports to arrive at an estimate of 70–80 killed, 12 captured, and 200 wounded.

The absence of Porter&#x27;s column greatly impacted Marmaduke&#x27;s chance for success at Springfield. Within four days, the Confederate raiders retreated to Arkansas. Springfield continued to remain an important supply and medical center for the Union army in the West.

A series of twelve interpretive markers have recently been placed throughout downtown Springfield at the important sites of the battle. They are intended to be visited in sequence on a walking tour. The first marker is located at Park Central Square, where it was removed from its original location at Street and Water Street.

Among the Confederate dead was Spencer McCoy, son of Kansas City, Missouri founder John C. McCoy. The elder McCoy was allowed to come to Springfield to claim his son who is buried with him in Union Cemetery in Kansas City.

<doc id="694893" wikidata="Q7875900" url="?curid=694893" title="USA Lacrosse">
<text>USA Lacrosse, a Recognized Sport Organization of the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, is the governing body of men and women&#x27;s lacrosse in the United States. It provides a leadership role in virtually every aspect of the game and has more than 425,000 members throughout the United States, and offers programs and services to inspire participation while protecting the integrity of the sport. The USA Lacrosse national headquarters is located in Sparks, Maryland along with the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame. In addition, the headquarters campus features the IWLCA Building, Tierney Field and a memorial to the members of the lacrosse community that died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. USA Lacrosse also oversees the U.S. National Team Program, which have won a combined 36 world championships, and the sport has been added to the 2028 Summer Olympics.

== History ==

USA Lacrosse was founded on January 1, 1998. It resulted from the merger of many different groups, including the Lacrosse Foundation, the United States Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Association, the National Junior Lacrosse Association, the United States Lacrosse Officials Association, United States Lacrosse Coaches Association, United States Club Lacrosse Association, the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates, the Central Atlantic Lacrosse League and National Intercollegiate Lacrosse Officials Association. Lacrosse is one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States.

== Structure and function ==

USA Lacrosse policy is determined by a national board of directors. A number of board committees, subcommittees and task forces help to shape strategy, planning and design of initiatives with direct board access for support and approval.

While serving as the sport&#x27;s governing body, USA Lacrosse works in collaboration with both the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) to oversee the game within the schools and colleges. NCAA and NFHS activity in lacrosse is almost exclusively focused on rules, with the additional NCAA focus on staging a postseason tournament. USA Lacrosse is essentially responsible for everything else related to the development of and service to the sport as its governing body.

The NCAA governs college post-season play and writes rules for college post season competitive play for the sport, which have traditionally been adopted for regular season play by all men’s and women’s college lacrosse conferences and independents.

The NFHS is a body that provides support and coordination to each independent state high school athletic association. However, each state association operates independently of the NFHS and sets its own regulations and policies. The NFHS has committees that write/review rules for sports. The NFHS has an independent rules committee for boys’ and girls&#x27; lacrosse on which USA Lacrosse is represented. 

USA Lacrosse also publishes USA Lacrosse Magazine six times per year, with a circulation to over 400,000 USA Lacrosse members. Its mission is to &quot;connect the sports community, educate players, coaches and officials, entertain fans and keep the membership of USA Lacrosse informed.&quot; In addition to the print magazine, USA Lacrosse maintains &quot;USA Lacrosse Magazine Online&quot;, which features daily national, regional and international lacrosse news, information, and scores, along with original features.

==Membership==
Fans, players, parents, coaches and officials can all be members of USA Lacrosse. USA Lacrosse members receive access to a variety of programs and services, discounts on books, videos, educational materials and U.S. National Team fan merchandise. Additionally, all members receive digital and print issues of &quot; USA Lacrosse Magazine&quot;, comprehensive lacrosse insurance, free admission to the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame and discounts on products and services while supporting the mission of the organization and of the sport at large.

== U.S. National Teams ==

As the United States is a full member of World Lacrosse, it takes part in all competitions organized and sanctioned by it. USA Lacrosse oversees all aspects of the U.S. Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s National, Sixes, Under-20 and Box Team programs.

The U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team has won 11 World Lacrosse Championships, world championships in field lacrosse at the senior team level and won six straight World Championships from 1982 to 2002. The last World Championships were held in San Diego in 2023 with the U.S. beating Canada in the gold medal game. In the U20, the United States has won every tournament to date with a total of nine championships, most recently in Limerick, Ireland in 2022.

The U.S. Women&#x27;s National Team has won nine Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cups. The most recent World Cup was held in Towson, Maryland in July 2022, where the U.S. defeated Canada 11-8 in the championship. In the women&#x27;s Under-20 World Lacrosse Championships, the United States has won world championships in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2019 and 2024. The U.S. women also won the inaugural World Lacrosse Box Championship in 2024.

==Facility==
USA Lacrosse moved to its current location in May 2016 and formally dedicated the new facility on Sept. 11, 2016. The facility is the result of a $15 million capital campaign entirely funded by private donors. Previously, the organization&#x27;s headquarters were located in Baltimore adjacent to Homewood Field on the Johns Hopkins University campus.

The IWLCA Building at USA Lacrosse National Headquarters is the centerpiece of the campus. The three-level 45,000 square foot structure hosts office and meeting space for the US Lacrosse staff, the Crum Family Education and Training Center, and locker rooms. A new National Lacrosse Hall of Fame and Museum, features the Richie Moran Hall of Fame Gallery and displays highlighting the heritage of the sport and the evolution to the modern game.

The building overlooks William G. Tierney Field, which will be the training home for the U.S. National Teams Program. The intimate, lighted facility boasts a permanent seating area for 500 fans and berms surround the field that will allow for additional spectators.

In addition to serving as the training facility for Team USA, Tierney Field hosts numerous college, high school and youth games each year along with coaching, officiating and player education clinics.

Just above the seating area to Tierney Field is the Henry A. Rosenberg Jr. Promenade, which includes The Creator’s Game statue sculpted by Jud Hartmann that was moved from the old USA Lacrosse headquarters. The promenade also includes 21 pillars honoring college lacrosse programs from around the country.

Surrounding the south end of the field is the Chris Sailer Trail honoring 11 Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association Trailblazers: Pat Genovese, Tina Sloan Green, Caroline Haussermann, Kathy Heinze, Carole Kleinfelder, Gillian Rattray, Sue Stahl, Sue Tyler, Lanetta Ware, Marge Watson and Judy Wolstenholme.

Located off the trail is the 9/11 Memorial, honoring the nearly 70 individuals from the lacrosse community that died during the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Landscape architect Kris Snider, a former All-American player at the University of Virginia, designed the memorial.

==Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame==
USA Lacrosse operates the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame at its headquarters in Sparks, Maryland. The new facility opened to the public in September 2016. Each year, members are inducted into the Hall of Fame for their contributions to the sport.

<doc id="694895" wikidata="Q1537653" url="?curid=694895" title="Ho-Chunk">
<text>The Ho-Chunk, also known as Hocąk, Hoocągra, or Winnebago are a Siouan-speaking Native American people whose historic territory includes parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois. Today, Ho-Chunk people are enrolled in two federally recognized tribes, the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Historically, the surrounding Algonquin tribes referred to them by a term that evolved to Winnebago, which was later used as well as by the French and English. The Ho-Chunk Nation have always called themselves Ho-Chunk. The name &quot;Ho-Chunk&quot; comes from the word &quot;Hoocąk&quot; and &quot;Hoocąkra,&quot; (&quot;Ho&quot; meaning &quot;voice&quot;, &quot;cąk&quot; meaning &quot;sacred&quot;, &quot;ra&quot; being a definitive article) meaning &quot;People of the Sacred Voice&quot;. Their name comes from oral traditions that state they are the originators of the many branches of the Siouan language.

The Ho-Chunk claim descendancy from both the effigy mound-building Late Woodland Period cultures and the successor Oneota culture; they say their ancestors built the thousands of effigy mounds through Wisconsin and surrounding states. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Ho-Chunk were the dominant tribe in its territory in the 16th century, with a population estimated at several thousand. They lived in permanent villages of wigwams and adopted cultivated corn, squash, and beans; they gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals, and used canoes to fish. 

Dugout canoes found near many small lakes and rivers are prompting new anthropological research projects near Madison, Wisconsin that may yield better information about ancient settlements.

Before the US government removed the Ho-Chunk from their native land in Wisconsin, the tribe consisted of 12 clans with specific roles often assigned to clans. Wars with the Illinois Confederacy and later wars with the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Meskwaki, and Sauk peoples pushed them out of their territories in eastern Wisconsin and Illinois, along with conflicts with the United States such as Winnebago War and Black Hawk War. The Ho-Chunk suffered severe population loss in the 17th century to a low of perhaps 500 individuals. This has been attributed to casualties of a lake storm, epidemics of infectious disease, and competition for resources from migrating Algonquian tribes. By the early 1800s, their population had increased to 2,900, but they suffered further losses in the smallpox epidemic of 1836. In 1990 they numbered 7,000; current estimates of total population of the two tribes are 12,000.

Through a series of moves imposed by the U.S. government in the 19th century, the tribe was relocated to reservations increasingly further west: in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and finally Nebraska. Oral history suggests some of the tribe may have been forcibly relocated up to 13 times by the federal government through forced treaty cession, losses estimated at 30 million acres in Wisconsin alone (they ceded lands in Wisconsin in 1829, 1832 and 1837; further removal attempts occurred in Wisconsin in 1840, 1846, 1850, and 1873–4). During these removals, bands of Ho-Chunk hid out in Wisconsin rather than be moved. In 1832, other bands of Ho-Chunk were moved to the Neutral Ground Reservation in eastern Iowa, where they faced hostile conditions between the warring Dakota people and Sauk peoples. They were removed from Iowa in 1848 into Minnesota, where they were moved twice from Todd County, Minnesota to Blue Earth County, Minnesota. After the Dakota War of 1862 and tensions created by the hate group Knights of the Forest, about 2,000 Ho-Chunk were interned at Camp Porter in Mankato before being expelled from Minnesota into Crow Creek, South Dakota in 1863. 

The Ho-Chunk often nonviolently resisted removal by staying home, or simply returning home, rather than engaging in uprisings. Poor conditions at Crow Creek led many Ho-Chunk to leave for the Omaha Reservation in Nebraska; The Winnebago Reservation was founded for the Ho-Chunk in Nebraska in 1865. The Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin is considered a &quot;non-reservation&quot; tribe, as members historically had to acquire individual homesteads in order to regain title to ancestral territory; they hold land in more than 13 counties in Wisconsin and have land in Illinois. The federal government has granted legal reservation status to some of these parcels, but the Ho-Chunk nation does not have a contiguous reservation in the traditional sense. While related, the two tribes are distinct federally recognized sovereign nations and peoples, each with its own constitutionally formed government and completely separate governing and business interests. Since the late 20th century, both tribal councils have authorized the development of casinos. The Ho-Chunk Nation is working on language restoration and has developed a Hoocąk-language iOS app and online dictionary.

== Etymology ==
The Ho-Chunk speak a Siouan language, which they believe was given to them by their creator, Mą’ųna (Earthmaker). Their native name is &quot;Ho-Chunk&quot; (or Hoocạk), which has been variously translated as &quot;sacred voice&quot; or &quot;People of the Big Voice&quot;, meaning mother tongue, as in they originated the Siouan language family.

Neighboring Siouan tribes refer to the Ho-Chunk by translations of their name into the their language, such as &quot;Hotúŋe&quot; in the Iowa-Otoe language) or &quot;Hotháŋka&quot; in the Dakota language. The term &quot;Winnebago&quot; is a term used by the Potawatomi, pronounced as &quot;Winnipego&quot;.

Nicolas Perrot was a 17th-century French trader who believed that the Algonquian terms referred to saltwater seas, as these have a distinctive aroma compared with freshwater lakes. An early Jesuit record says that the name refers to the origin of &quot;Le Puans&quot; near the saltwater seas to the north. When the explorers Jean Nicolet and Samuel de Champlain learned of the &quot;sea&quot; connection to the tribe&#x27;s name, they were optimistic that it meant &quot;Les Puans&quot; were from or had lived near the Pacific Ocean. They hoped it indicated a passage to China via the great rivers of the Midwest.

==Culture==
Before Europeans ventured into Ho-Chunk territory, the Ho-Chunk were known to hunt, farm, and gather food from local sources, including nuts, berries, roots, and edible leaves. They knew what the forest and river&#x27;s edge had to give and both genders had a role in making best use of resources. With the changing seasons, Ho-Chunk families moved from area to area to find food. For example, many families returned to Black River Falls, Wisconsin, to pick berries in the summer.

Ho-Chunk women were responsible for growing, gathering, and processing food for their families, including the cultivation of varieties of corn and squash, in order to have different types through the growing season; and gathering a wide variety of roots, nuts, and berries, as well as sap from maple trees. In addition, women learned to recognize and use a wide range of roots and leaves for medicinal and herbal purposes. The maple sap was used to make syrup and candy. Women also processed and cooked game, making dried meats combined with berries to sustain their families when traveling. Tanned hides were used to make clothing and storage bags. They used most parts of the game for tools, binding, clothing, and coverings for dwellings. They were responsible for the survival of the families, caring for the children as well as elders.

The main role of the Ho-Chunk man was as a hunter—and a warrior when needed. Leaders among the men interfaced with other tribes. As hunters, they speared fish and clubbed them to death. The men also hunted game such as muskrat, mink, otter, beaver, and deer. Some men learned to create jewelry and other body decorations out of silver and copper, for both men and women. To become men, boys would go through a rite of passage at puberty: they fasted for a period during which they were expected to acquire a guardian spirit; without it, their lives would be miserable.

Besides having a guardian spirit, men would also try to acquire protection and powers from specific spirits, which was done by making offerings along with tobacco. For example, a man would not go on the warpath without first performing the &quot;war-bundle feast&quot;, which contained two parts. The first part honored the night-spirits and the second part honored the Thunderbird spirit. The blessings these spirits gave the men were embodied in objects that together made the war-bundle. These objects could include feathers, bones, skins, flutes, and paints.
==History==
===Ancestral Ho-Chunk===

Ho-Chunk oral history says they have always lived in their current homelands of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois. Their Siouan language indicates common origin with other peoples of this language group. They say their ancestors built the thousands of effigy mounds through Wisconsin and surrounding states during the Late Woodland period. In the Terminal Late Woodland Period, the practice of building effigy mounds abruptly ceased with the appearance of the Oneota Culture. The Ho-Chunk claim descendancy from both the effigy mound-building Late Woodland cultures and the successor Oneota Culture. The tribe historically adopted corn agriculture at the end of the Late Woodland period as well as hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. They cultivated wild rice (&quot;Zizania&quot; spp.) and gathered sugar from sugar maple trees.

===European contact and tribe split===
European contact came in 1634 with the arrival of French explorer Jean Nicolet. He wrote that the Winnebago/Ho-Chunk occupied the area around Green Bay of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin, reaching beyond Lake Winnebago to the Wisconsin River and to the Rock River in Illinois. The oral history also indicates that in the mid-16th century, the influx of Ojibwe peoples in the northern portion of their lands caused the Ho-Chunk to move to the south of their territory. They had some friction with the tribes of the Illinois Confederacy as well as fellow Chiwere-speaking peoples splitting from the Ho-Chunk. These groups, who became the Iowa, Missouria, and Otoe tribes, moved south and west because the reduced range made it difficult for such a large population to be sustained.

===Population decline===
Nicolet reported a gathering of approximately 5,000 warriors as the Ho-Chunk entertained him. Historians estimate that the population in 1634 may have ranged from 8,000 to more than 20,000. Between that time and the first return of French trappers and traders in the late 1650s, the population was reduced drastically. Later reports were that the Ho-Chunk numbered only about 500. When numerous Algonquian tribes migrated west to escape the aggressive Iroquois tribes in the Beaver Wars, they competed for game and resources with the Ho-Chunk, who had to yield to their greater numbers.

The reasons historians give for the reduction in population vary, but they agree on three major causes: the loss of several hundred warriors in a storm on a lake, infectious disease epidemics after contact with Europeans, and attacks by the Illinois Confederacy. The warriors were said to be lost on Lake Michigan after they had repulsed the first attack by invading the Potawatomi from what is now Door County, Wisconsin. Another says the number was 600. Another claim is that the 500 were lost in a storm on Lake Winnebago during a failed campaign against the Meskwaki, while yet another says it was in a battle against the Sauk. Even with such a serious loss of warriors, the historian R. David Edmunds notes that it was not enough to cause the near elimination of an entire people. He suggests two additional causes. The Winnebago apparently suffered from a widespread disease, perhaps an epidemic of one of the European infectious diseases. They had no immunity to the new diseases and suffered high rates of fatalities. Ho-Chunk accounts said the victims turned yellow, which is not a trait of smallpox. Historians have rated disease as the major reason for the losses in all Native American populations. Edmunds notes as a third cause of the population decline the following historic account: decimation by the Illinois Confederacy. The Ho-Chunk had been helped at one time by many of their enemies, in particular the Illinois Confederacy, during their time of suffering and famine, aggravated by the loss of their hunters. The Winnebago then attacked the Illinois Confederacy. Enraged, additional Illinois warriors retaliated and killed nearly all the Ho-Chunk.

After peace was established between the French and Iroquois in 1701, many of the Algonquian peoples returned to their homelands to the east. The Ho-Chunk were then relieved of that pressure on their territory and after 1741, most returned inland. From a low of perhaps less than 500, the population gradually recovered, aided by intermarriage with neighboring tribes and some of the French traders and trappers. A count from 1736 gives a population of 700; in 1806, they numbered more than 2,900. A census in 1846 reported 4,400 people but by 1848, there were reportedly 2,500. Like other Native American tribes, the Ho-Chunk suffered great losses during the smallpox epidemics of 1757–58 and 1836. In the 19th-century epidemic, they lost nearly a quarter of their population. Today the Ho-Chunk population is about 12,000.

The Black Hawk War of 1832 was fought largely on Ho-Chunk land. In early 1832, White Cloud invited the Sauk band to live in the Rock River band&#x27;s Illinois villages. About 1,200 Ho-Chunk, Fox, Kickapoo, and others came, from locations such as Saukenuk on the Iowa reservation, where there was little food. The arrivals included Black Sparrow Hawk, who had been a leading warrior of the British Band during the War of 1812.

===Series of forced removals===
Through a series of moves imposed by the U.S. government in the 19th century, the tribe was relocated to reservations increasingly further west: in Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, and finally Nebraska. Oral history suggests some of the tribe may have been forcibly relocated up to 13 times by the federal government to steal land through forced treaty cession, losses estimated at 30 million acres in Wisconsin alone. The Ho-Chunk often nonviolently resisted removal by staying home, or simply returning home, rather than engaging in uprisings.

The Winnebago ceded lands in Wisconsin in 1829, 1832 and 1837; further removal attempts occurred in Wisconsin in 1840, 1846, 1850, and 1873–4.
The 1848 removal from Iowa was documented by a soldier in Morgan&#x27;s Mounted Volunteers. About 2,500 people were forced to travel by wagon, on foot, and on horseback from Fort Atkinson, Iowa to Winona, Minnesota, and thence by steamboat to a new Reservation covering parts of Stearns, Morrison, and Todd Counties, and with its agency at Long Prairie, Minnesota. The Long Prairie Reservation, which was heavily wooded, was more suitable for logging than for farming. Writing in 1915, St. Cloud, Minnesota journalist and local historian William Bell Mitchell recalled that as of 1850, the Ho-Chunk &quot;had one of their main villages on the west bank of the Mississippi River&quot;, and at the mouth of the Watab River in what is now Sartell, Minnesota. The Long Prairie Reservation was dissolved in 1855, and its residents were moved to Blue Earth County, Minnesota. While relating a May 1860 series of raids and revenge killings between the Chippewa and Dakota peoples in which one Ho-Chunk warrior was also killed in Maine Prairie Township, Stearns County, Minnesota, George W. Sweet, a pioneer settler of Sauk Rapids, recalled, &quot;The Winnebagoes were supposed to be a neutral party between the Sioux and Chippewa, but occasionally a Winnebago would join a party of Sioux on a raid against the Chippewas.&quot;

During the 1862 Dakota War, a very small faction of the Ho-Chunk led by Chief Little Priest joined forces with the uprising and its figurehead leader, Chief Little Crow. This had disastrous results for all the Ho-Chunk living in Minnesota.

===Reservations formation===

In 1863, the Ho-Chunk were forced to leave Blue Earth County by the Knights of the Forest, a secret society hate group organized by vengeful prominent pioneer settlers in nearby Mankato. Blue Earth County commissioners sent for &quot;negro bloodhounds&quot; from the South to assist the Knights of the Forest. The Knights sent armed men to surround the Ho-Chunks&#x27; prime farmland and shoot any Ho-Chunk who crossed the line. About 2,000 Ho-Chunk were interned at Camp Porter in Mankato, and thence removed to the Crow Creek Indian Reservation in Dakota Territory. Poor conditions at Crow Creek led many Ho-Chunk to leave for an Omaha reservation in Nebraska. The Winnebago Reservation was founded for the Ho-Chunk in Nebraska in 1865.

Following the forced relocations, many tribe members returned to previous homes, especially in Wisconsin, despite the U.S. Army&#x27;s repeated roundups and forced removals. But the federal government finally allowed the Winnebago to resettle and acquire land in their ancestral homeland in Wisconsin, which eventually received recognition as an official Reservation known as the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin. The Ho-Chunk in Nebraska have gained independent federal recognition as a tribe and have a reservation in Thurston County. The Ho-Chunk Nation now has a constitution that reinforces its sovereign abilities to negotiate with the US government.

Waukon and Decorah, county seats of Allamakee and Winneshiek County, Iowa, respectively, were named after the 19th-century Ho-Chunk Chief Waukon Decorah.

== Ho-Chunk clans ==
Before the US government removed the Ho-Chunk from their native land in Wisconsin, the tribe consisted of 12 clans (see table). In pre-contact Ho-Chunk society, clans were typically associated with specific social roles; for instance, the Thunderbird Clan was the clan from which chiefs were appointed, while the Bear Clan enforced discipline within the community and oversaw prisoners.

The clans were associated with animal spirits representing the traditional responsibilities within the nation; each clan had a role in the survival of the people. Like other Native Americans, the Ho-Chunk had rules generally requiring people to marry outside their clans. The kinship system was based in the family and gave structure to descent and inheritance rules. Although the tribe is patrilineal today, anthropologists believe they may have had a matrilineal kinship system in the 17th century before their major losses. At that time, the matriarchs of a clan would name its chief and they could reclaim the position if they disapproved of his actions. The Ho-Chunk may have shifted to the patrilineal system due to marriage into other tribes or under the influence of the male-oriented fur trade.

Today there are two federally recognized tribes of Ho-Chunk people, the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin and the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.

===Ho-Chunk Nation===

This tribe is headquartered in Black River Falls, Wisconsin. Formerly known as the &quot;Wisconsin Winnebago Tribe&quot;, it changed its name to &quot;Ho-Chunk Nation&quot; to take back the traditional Siouan name. Ho-Chunk usually call themselves meaning &quot;sacred voice people of the Pines&quot;. They also call themselves &quot;wąąkšik&quot; – &quot;people&quot;. They are the larger of the two federally recognized Ho-Chunk tribes.

The Ho-Chunk have established the &quot;Hoocąk Waaziija Haci&quot; Language and Culture Division, which has developed materials to teach and restore use of the &quot;Hocąk&quot; language and other elements of their culture. Among its recent innovations is the development of a Hocąk-language app for the iPhone. The Ho-Chunk have about 200 native speakers among its elders.

Of the 7,192 tribal members as of May 2011, 5,042 lived in Wisconsin. The tribes own 4,602 acres (18.625 km2) scattered across parts of 12 counties in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota. The largest concentrations are in Jackson, Clark, and Monroe counties in Wisconsin. Smaller areas lie in Adams, Crawford, Dane, Juneau, La Crosse, Marathon, Rock, Sauk, Shawano, and Wood counties in Wisconsin. The Ho-Chunk Nation also owns land in Lynwood, Illinois.

====Government====
The Ho-Chunk Nation established a written constitution and is governed by an elected council. , the current president is Jon Greendeer.

Since the late 20th century, the tribe operates six casinos in Wisconsin, in order to raise funds:
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Wisconsin Dells in Baraboo,
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Black River Falls,
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Nekoosa,
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Wittenberg,
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Tomah, and
*Ho-Chunk Gaming Madison.
In February 2013, the Beloit Common Council sold land to the Ho-Chunk Nation for a proposed casino.

The council has used revenues to enhance infrastructure, healthcare, and educational support for its people.

In 1988, the Ho-Chunk Nation filed a timely claim for transfer of the Badger Army Ammunition Plant (BAAP), which was to be declared surplus under federal regulations. As part of their former traditional territory, the property holds historical, archeological, sacred, and cultural resources important to their people. It is a 1500-acre parcel in Sauk County, Wisconsin. Between 1998 and 2011, the Army spent millions of dollars in environmental assessments and cleanup to prepare the property for transfer. In 1998 the Secretary of the Interior had issued a letter to claim the land on behalf of the Ho-Chunk but in 2011, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) refused to accept the property. It was unwilling to conduct an environmental assessment due to cost.

In 2012 the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) passed a resolution in support of the Ho-Chunk and to encourage the BIA to accept surplus lands in trust on behalf of tribes. Finally, through a special act of congress, the Ho-Chunk Nation took control of the 1500 acre parcel in 2015. This is regarded as the first time that the United States&#x27; military has ever returned land to an indigenous people. Today, the Ho-Chunk Nation is restoring the prairie that was present at the site before European settlement. 

===Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska===
The tribe has a reservation in northeastern Nebraska and western Iowa. The Winnebago Indian Reservation lies primarily in the northern part of Thurston and a small part of Dixon counties in Nebraska, with an additional portion in Woodbury County, Iowa. A small plot of off-reservation land of is in southern Craig Township in Burt County, Nebraska. The total land area is 457.857 km2 (176.78 sq mi).

They refer to themselves as meaning &quot;sacred voice people living on the Missouri River&quot;.

The Iowa portion was originally west of the Missouri River and within Nebraska boundaries. After the United States Army Corps of Engineers changed the course of the river, some of the reservation land was redefined as falling within the boundaries of Iowa. The tribe successfully argued that the land belonged to them under the terms of the deed prior to diversion of the river. This land has a postal address of Sloan, Iowa, as rural addresses are normally covered by the nearest post office.

The 2000 census reported a population of 2,588 people living on these lands. The largest community is the village of Winnebago, with others in Emerson and Thurston, Nebraska. In 2006 their enrolled population was estimated at 4,000.

The federally recognized Omaha also have a reservation in Thurston County. Together, the Native American tribes occupy the entire land area of Thurston County.

====Government====
The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska has a written constitution and is governed by an elected nine-person council.

Since 1992 the Winnebago tribe has owned and operated the WinnaVegas Casino on its lands in Iowa. The tribe legalized alcohol sales to keep liquor tax revenue, earmarked for supporting individuals and families affected by alcoholism. More than 60% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states have legalized alcohol sales.

In 1994 the tribe established Ho-Chunk, Inc., an economic development corporation that now employs 1400 people. Its success has earned the tribe small business organization awards. It has initiated a strong housing construction program in collaboration with federal programs. Its leaders were featured on &quot;Native American Entrepreneurs&quot; in 2009 on PBS.

== Land claims ==
According to Gordon Thunder (Wakąja), the Ho-Chunk have been systematically removed from their homelands, many now occupied by other tribes. The Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, which at one time consisted primarily of tribal members spread over 13 counties of Wisconsin, have a historical territorial claim in an area encompassed by a line from Green Bay to Long Prairie to St. Louis to Chicago. Some in the federal and state governments have undermined the Ho-Chunk land claims; however, repatriation activities document where many villages once stood.

<text>Bomber B was a German military aircraft design competition organised just before the start of World War II intended to develop a second-generation high-speed bomber for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The new designs would be a direct successor to the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; philosophy of the Dornier Do 17 and Junkers Ju 88, relying on high speed as its primary defence. Bomber B would be a much larger and more capable aircraft, with range and payload far greater than the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;, surpassing the largest conventional designs then under consideration. The winning design was intended to form the backbone of the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; bomber force, replacing the wide collection of semi-specialized designs then in service. The Reich Air Ministry was so optimistic that more modest projects were generally cancelled; when the project failed the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was left with hopelessly outdated aircraft.

==Background==
By the late 1930s airframe construction techniques had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, founded on the all-metal airframe design technologies pioneered by Hugo Junkers with the Junkers J 1 in 1915 and improved over the two following decades – especially in Germany with aircraft like the Dornier Do X flying boat and the Junkers G 38 airliner, and the Soviet Union with the enormous &quot;Maksim Gorki&quot;, the largest aircraft built anywhere in the 1930s.

Engines for such designs were a limiting factor. 

In Germany, most bomber designs in service were adapted from pre-war designs, many of them passenger aircraft or dual-use designs. The first specialist bomber aircraft was the Junkers Ju 88, which had limited range and payload, forcing the Luftwaffe to use the Heinkel He 111 for other missions. A shortage of both types forced the early-war Luftwaffe to improvise with an assortment of aircraft. The Luftwaffe was displeased with this situation.

In the early 1930s Luftwaffe Chief of Staff Walther Wever initiated the Ural bomber program for the design a long-range bomber capable of bombing factories in the Ural Mountain area from bases far to the west. Limited engine power led to very large designs with limited performance and neither of the designs, the Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89, were put into production. Wever&#x27;s death on June 3, 1936, prompted the RLM to release the &quot;Bomber A&quot; heavy bomber design specification the same day, looking for a new heavy bomber with improved range and greater payload than the Ural Bomber prototypes. The winning design, given its RLM airframe number on November 5, 1937, was the Heinkel He 177.

The Bomber A program was still in the process of selecting the winning design when the first German large capacity engines began testing. Compared to the Jumo 211s in the Ju 88, a pair of such engines would more than double available power, upwards to 5,000 hp (3680 kW). With this power, a significantly more capable design could be built, one with considerably larger internal space for a much larger bomb load, more fuel for longer range and greater speed. Junkers had been studying dramatically more capable versions of the Ju 88 powered by their relatively compact Jumo 222 or the four-crankshaft Jumo 223 diesel engine design from late 1937. No serious work was undertaken, but after Heinrich Hertel left Heinkel and joined Junkers in 1939, the EF 74 design was submitted to the RLM in May 1939.

Apparently excited by the possibilities of an aircraft with the payload and range of the He 177 combined with higher performance than the Ju 88, the RLM promulgated the specifications for &quot;Bomber B&quot; in July 1939. The specification called for a new medium bomber with a maximum speed of 600 km/h (375 mph), able to carry a bomb load of 4000 kg (8,820 lb) to any part of Britain from bases in France or Norway. To improve crew performance and defensive firepower, the designs were to have a pressurized cabin with remotely aimed armament. As it was meant to have the desirable combination of extended range, larger payload and better performance, whatever design won the Bomber B competition would replace all bombers in service.

==Large twins==
With engines in the 2,000 to 2,500 hp range, twin-engined aircraft would have considerably more surplus power, allowing for much greater payloads. In theory, the more powerful engine would take no longer to produce than a 1,000 hp design, it would simply be larger. By the late 1930s, engines of this sort of power began to be seriously considered and the British and Germans drew up bomber designs based on them.

In the UK, Avro and Handley Page drew up proposals for a large bomber based on two Rolls-Royce Vulture engines. The Vulture had four six-cylinder cylinder blocks connected to a common crankcase and crankshaft, to make a larger displacement X-block design. As the projects matured, problems with the Vulture became evident. Contrary to hopes, bringing together two V-12 engines&#x27; onto one crankcase led to many problems. Development of the Avro Manchester continued but Handley Page was asked to adapt their HP.56 design for four smaller engines. When the Manchester flew with all of the problems with the Vulture remaining, it too received a four-engine revision by its designer, Roy Chadwick. The Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax designs formed the backbone of RAF Bomber Command for the remainder of the war.

In Germany, the Bomber A program in mid-1936 had led to the Heinkel He 177 A, powered by two Daimler-Benz DB 606 &quot;power system&quot; engines. The 606 was a late-1930s attempt to use two Daimler-Benz DB 601 powerplants driving a common gear reduction case, resulting in a 24-cylinder powerplant like the Vulture but using having two crankcases for the Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance design and the Messerschmitt Me 261 long range aircraft. The pair of DB 601 component engines were arranged in an inverted W-block layout, keeping each component engine as a separate engine as far as possible. As with the Vulture, Daimler Benz engineers found the DB 606, weighing in at a massive 1.5 tonnes apiece was mediocre, particularly when the airframe mounting them possessed an engine accommodation design that prevented adequate maintenance access and ventilation.

Production of the He 177A continued and in service with deficient powerplant installation, engine nacelle internal design and maintenance access, it was plagued by engine failures, overheating and fires while airborne, earning it the nickname &quot;Flaming Coffin&quot; by its crews. 

==High-output engines==
Simultaneously with the early development of the &quot;coupled&quot; engines, Daimler-Benz began work on a 1,500 kW class design using a single crankcase. The result was the twenty-four cylinder Daimler-Benz DB 604, with four banks of six cylinders each. Possessing essentially the same displacement of 46.5 litres (2830 in3) as the initial version of the Junkers Jumo 222, its protracted development was diverting valuable German aviation powerplant research resources, and with more development of the DB 610 coupled engine giving improved results at the time, the Reich Air Ministry stopped all work on the DB 604 in September 1942.

BMW worked on what was essentially an enlarged version of its highly successful BMW 801 design from the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. This led to the 53.7-litre displacement BMW 802 in 1943, an eighteen-cylinder air-cooled radial, and the even larger, 83.5 litre displacement BMW 803 28-cylinder liquid-cooled radial. As both the 802 and 803 proved to be dismal failures in testing, their development only went so far as to prioritize the 802 for &quot;completion and prototype construction as a secondary issue&quot;, while the 803 only received attention to &quot;its design and development&quot;. This state of affairs at BMW led to the company&#x27;s engineering staff being redirected to place all efforts on improving the 801 to develop it to its full potential. Only the BMW 801F radial development, through its use of features coming from the 801E subtype, was able to substantially exceed the over-1,500 kW output level — the F-version was tested at a top output level of some 1,765 kW (2,400 PS) of take-off power. 

The Junkers company&#x27;s 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222, liquid cooled six-bank inline engine, with four cylinders in each bank, came the closest to being the only production, single-crankcase design high-output powerplant candidate during the war years, intended to power not only the Junkers Ju 288, but also many other German multi-engined advanced combat aircraft projects. The 222 was a remarkably compact and efficient engine design, being almost identical in cylinder number, displacement and weight to the British Napier Sabre H-type four-bank sleeve valved inline engine, and the best attempt at creating a German aviation engine that could routinely exceed 1,500 kW output at altitude, but as with the BMW designs and even the later Heinkel HeS 011 advanced turbojet engine, never approached being a production-ready aircraft powerplant, with just under 300 examples of the Jumo 222 produced between several different versions.

==Designs==

Arado, Dornier, Focke-Wulf and Junkers all responded with designs and Henschel later added the Hs 130. It was clear even at this point that the call for designs was to some extent a formality, as the Junkers design had already been selected for production. The Ar 340 was dropped in the design stage and Do 317 was relegated to low-priority development, while prototype orders were placed for the Fw 191 and the Ju 288. With the Focke-Wulf and Dornier projects as first and second backups, the &quot;Technisches-Amt&quot; technical development office of the RLM started using these other designs as experimental testbeds. The Fw 191 was based around an all-electric platform to power nearly all its flight accessories, in place of hydraulics. The Fw 191 thus earned the nickname of &quot;Das Fliegende Kraftwerk&quot; (the flying power station). This dramatically increased the complexity of wiring the planes and the chance that one of the many motors would fail was considerable but that was not considered terribly important—it was felt that the Junkers design would work anyway.

==The end of the project==
Prototype airframes of the Ju 288 and Fw 191 designs were ready mid-1940 but neither the Jumo 222 nor the DB 604 were ready. Both teams decided to power their prototypes with the BMW 801 radial engine, although with 900 hp less per engine and with the BMW 801 radials themselves barely out of initial development, the planes were seriously underpowered. For comparative purposes, the nearly-equal displacement Wright Twin Cyclone radial engine was powering the American B-25 Mitchell twin-engined medium bomber with some 1,270 kW (1,700 hp) apiece of output, even with the B-25 having only a top airspeed of some 440 km/h (273 mph) at a take off weight of 15.9 tonnes (35,000 lb).

The first Jumo 222A/B development engines did not arrive until October 1941 and some eleven months later the DB 604 project was cancelled. By May 1942, in desperation, it was suggested that the Daimler-Benz DB 606 be used instead, even though it was considerably larger and heavier (1.5 tonnes) and was well known to have serious problems. Prototypes of both designs with these engines were ordered, although the Fw 191 was just getting into the air with the BMW 801 radials at this point and the Ju 288 was showing a continual tendency to break its main landing gear on touchdown, partly due to its undercarriage problems caused by its complex method of stowing the oleo struts during retraction.

The RLM had no designs to fill the gap left if Bomber B did not work, even though some minor designs like the Henschel Hs 130, usually powered with two DB 603 or 605 engines and the Dornier Do 317, being tried with the same, trouble-prone DB 606 or 610 &quot;welded-together engines&quot; on some of its prototype airframes were also being considered. A slightly improved Ju 88, based on the prototype Ju 88B design, was ordered as the Ju 188 and several prototypes of stretched versions of existing bomber designs with four engines were also ordered, as with Junkers&#x27; Ju 488 in 1943–44.

In June 1943, the T-Amt finally gave up; by this point, even if the Jumo 222 started working reliably, as it had begun to do in the summer of 1943, a shortage of the metals needed for the high-temperature alloys it used meant it would not be able to enter production anyway, with just under 300 development powerplants built. The three-year development period during the war in Europe, with no combat-ready designs to show for the effort, meant that the Bomber B project was a time-consuming venture that delivered nothing, while also serving to ensure that no other designs were available in late 1943, when their existing twin-engined medium bombers, most developed in the mid–late 30s, started to become hopelessly outdated.

With the failure of Bomber B, four engine versions of the He 177, which had first been officially considered as early as October 1941 with the &quot;He 177H&quot; paper-only derivative, the ancestor of the Heinkel He 274 high-altitude design project, were considered as replacements for the mainline variants of the He 177A through most of 1943. The trio of completed DB 603-powered He 177B prototypes would start their flight tests by the end of 1943. Production of the B-series He 177s by Arado Flugzeugwerke, the prime subcontractor for Heinkel&#x27;s heavy bombers, was never undertaken as the Arado firm had priority for its jet-powered Arado Ar 234 bomber and by early July 1944, four months before Arado would be able to commence license-built construction of the He 177B-5, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; began the Emergency Fighter Program.

<text>The San Marino Football Federation (FSGC; ) is the governing body of football in San Marino. It organizes the San Marino football league (Campionato Sammarinese), a national cup (Coppa Titano), a super cup (Trofeo Federale) and the San Marino national football team. It is based in the city of San Marino. As of 18 August 2024, the FIFA committee recognizes San Marino as the lowest-ranking team according to the FIFA World Rankings.

The FSGC also helped to create the original incarnation of A.S.D. Victor San Marino, a team that plays in Serie D, the fourth division of the Italian league.

<text>The International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is a biological olympiad for pre-university students under the age 20, and is one of the most well-known International Science Olympiads. The first IBO was held in Czechoslovakia in 1990, and it has since been held annually. The competition has gradually expanded to include more than 75 participating countries across five continents. All participating countries send the four winners of their National Biology Olympiad to the IBO, usually accompanied by two adults who are members of the international jury, for the duration of the competition. 

To select these top four life science contestants for this international competition, all member countries host Biology Olympiad competitions in typically 3-5 consecutively more difficult national competition rounds. As a consequence, this leads to a trickle-down effect, engaging more than 1 million students worldwide in life science each year.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the IBO (host: Japan) was organized virtually and was rated &quot;a great success&quot; and &quot;highly successful&quot; in the history of IBO because of its exceptional way of operation and the unique international group-based scientific project International Group Project 2020.

In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Portuguese IBO host to go virtual once again: the 2021 IBO was replaced by the IBO Challenge II, from July 18 to July 23.

== IBO 2020 and the International Group Project ==
In the face of the threat of the International Science Olympiads&#x27; cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic (the International Physics Olympiad was officially canceled), the IBO 2020 was the first in the International Science Olympiads that was claimed by the host (Japan) to be held entirely virtually with a guaranteed supervision to adapt to the pandemic. 

Notably, in the IBO 2020, the International Group Project was proposed. This is the first international group-based scientific project in the history of International Science Olympiads, aiming to intensify scientific discussion and collaboration among competitors from various countries.

In the International Group Project 2020, there are 50 research teams, and every team consists of 4 to 7 competitors, all representing different countries. In each team, these young biologists collaborated with their international fellows in a three-month scientific project. Finally, they had to propose a professional poster or presentation about an outstanding, innovative idea that can determine biology&#x27;s future and solve a critical global issue. Every performance was evaluated by noble professors of Japan in life science. 

Altogether, 53 countries and 202 contestants participated in the International Group Project 2020. This project was described as &quot;the first trial of a collaborative research opportunity in IBO&#x27;s history.&quot; Among 50 teams, six outstanding teams had (25 students) received the &quot;Award of Excellence&quot; for &quot;the best performance&quot;. 

== Summary ==
Each year, the IBO is organised by a different country.

== Performance of countries ==
As of August 2024, the current list of countries with the best results (spanning the last 10 years) for gold medals are as follows:

<text>Nina Webster is a fictional character from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, an American soap opera on the CBS network, portrayed by Tricia Cast. She was introduced during the episode airing on June 26, 1986, as a pregnant teenager whom Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) befriends. Cast remained a regular cast member for fifteen years before asking for a contract release and departing onscreen in February 2001. In 2008, the actress returned for several guest spots, and the following year, she returned for a bigger storyline, and has continued to make occasional appearances until 2014. Cast later returned in 2020 to present.

Cast described Nina as &quot;someone who is confused generally&quot;. After her child was stolen from her hands at birth, Nina was later involved in a romance with Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz), which resulted in another child, Phillip Chancellor IV (John Driscoll). Phillip III then died—which many years later proved to be faked—and Nina raised Phillip IV as a single mother. She became a novelist and screenwriter, also having marriages to David Kimble (Michael Corbett) and Ryan McNeil (Scott Reeves). Nina was also involved with a man named Tomas Del Cerro (Francesco Quinn), a publisher interested in a novel of hers about her stolen son. In 2010, Nina met her long lost son, revealed to be Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson). In 1992, Cast won a Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal.

==Casting==
Cast debuted in the role onscreen on June 26, 1986, with her first run lasting fifteen years. She went on to reveal in 1993 that she only expected her role to be short term on the soap opera. In September 2000, it was announced that Cast had requested to be released from her contract, leading to much speculation as to why she chose to leave. Cast&#x27;s publicist later issued a statement, saying: &quot;Tricia has decided to take a sabbatical from Hollywood for an indefinite period of time. She is looking forward to spending some quality time with her new husband in Tennessee.&quot; Her last airdate was January 31, 2001. In 2008, it was announced that Cast would be returning for several guest appearances along with various other previous actors, airing from November 14 to 20, 2008. In April 2009, Cast was announced to be reprising the role again for a bigger storyline. She then remained on a recurring status with the soap opera for the following three years. She then made guest appearances in September 2013 and on August 27, 2014.

In October 2020, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; announced Cast would return to the role in &quot;early November,&quot; as well as the week of November 30 of the same year, to celebrate the soap&#x27;s 12,000th episode. Cast returned to the show on November 18, 2020.

==Storylines==
===1986–2001===
After getting pregnant by a man named Jimmy, Nina Webster ran away from her home and spent nights on a park bench in Genoa City, before being found by Christine Blair, with whom she soon became friends. She found a place to live at Rose DeVille&#x27;s home, but had no idea that Rose was involved in a black-market baby snatching. When Nina gave birth to a son, she decided to keep the baby, but Rose made sure that this would not happen as she stole the baby and sold him to a couple, the Lansings, who were desperate to adopt, afterwards Rose left town. Nina decided to get her life back on track, but things did not seem to work out well. She set her sights on Christine&#x27;s boyfriend Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz), seduced him and ended up pregnant yet again. In a rare act of unity, Phillip&#x27;s mother Jill Foster Abbott and her sworn enemy Katherine Chancellor attempted to pay Nina to leave town, but she refused.

After a difficult delivery, Nina gives birth to a baby boy named Phillip Chancellor IV. She and Phillip marry and not even Jill or Kay can separate the happy couple; however, their happiness is ruined when Phillip dies from injuries sustained after a car accident. She ended up with a considerable fortune despite Jill and Katherine&#x27;s attempt to keep Nina away from the Chancellor fortune.

Soon after, Nina began dating Jill&#x27;s former assistant David Kimble. Nina&#x27;s friends Christine and Danny Romalotti warned Nina against David, but Nina and David continued their romance. David even threatened Christine to keep away from Nina, and when Christine told Nina, she did not believe her. Nina and David ended up quickly eloping and he signed a prenuptial agreement, but David ended up having an affair with a mailroom attendant Diane Weston. It was soon discovered that David had killed his first wife Rebecca and when Rebecca&#x27;s friend showed up in Genoa City to prove David killed her, she herself was killed. Christine and Danny continued to look into David, and David tried to frame Danny for cocaine possession in retaliation. Nina ended up learning from Diane that David was going to kill her and Phillip IV. Soon after, Nina shot David five times and was in turn arrested for attempted murder. It was later dropped when she convinced the jury that she shot David in self-defense.

By 1991, David returned in disguise and with the name of Jim Adams, and began romancing Nina&#x27;s mother Florence. He was able to convince Nina to change her will to make Florence and him the co- beneficiaries of Nina&#x27;s estate. At a masquerade ball, David intended to kill Nina, Christine, and Danny, but his ex-lover Diane warned them. They ended up tricking David to think that he killed them all and was soon being investigated by the police. He hid in a garbage chute at one point and was then killed by a garbage compactor.

She then started an affair with Ryan McNeil, who at the time was married to Victoria Newman. Their relationship continued after Ryan and Victoria&#x27;s marriage ended, and Nina ended up pregnant once again, leaving Ryan with no choice but to marry her. Nina miscarried, and it was then when Ryan realized how much he loved her. During their marriage though, Nina fell for Cole Howard, who incidentally was another one of Victoria&#x27;s husbands. Cole didn&#x27;t want to be with her and Nina was having hard time dealing with the truth, and her marriage to Ryan suffered because of it. Ryan fell for another woman, Tricia Dennison, and the feelings of rejection from both Cole and Ryan caused her to try to die by suicide. Ryan convinced her not to do this but a shot was fired and she lost her memory. She survived, however Ryan was believed to have shot Nina, who later regained her memory and told the police the truth.

Nina evolved into a more mature woman; she continued writing novels and began a friendship with a man named Tomas Del Cerro, a world-renowned novelist. Their friendship soon evolved into a relationship. Nina&#x27;s career took an upswing when Tomas&#x27; publisher became interested in her novel &quot;A Cry in Thin Air&quot;, which involved her story regarding her long-lost child. He decided to propose to Nina and she reluctantly accepted, but their relationship was soon over when Tomas was unable to get over Nina&#x27;s success as a writer. Tomas disappeared from Genoa City, and Nina left town to escape her past.

===2008–2014===
In 2008, Nina returned to Genoa City to attend Katherine&#x27;s funeral (although in truth, Katherine was alive, and it was her lookalike Marge Cotrooke who had died). She revealed that she is still writing screenplays, although without much success and that her son Phillip IV was now enlisted in the army and currently serving in Iraq. Nina returned to town again for Katherine&#x27;s wedding to Patrick Murphy. She discovered a drunken Jill at the door as she was arriving; she promptly tied Jill up and hid her in the hall closet so she would not disturb the ceremony. However, she wasn&#x27;t in there for long, as Lauren Fenmore Baldwin heard her muffled screams and let her out. After the wedding, she decided to approach Katherine with the idea of turning her recently published autobiography into a film; Katherine complied under the condition that her collaborator, Amber Moore, co-write the movie with her.

During Nina&#x27;s long absence from Genoa City, it was revealed that Jill&#x27;s son Phillip III was switched shortly after birth by a jealous and alcoholic Katherine. Jill&#x27;s true son was taken to Australia, returning years later under the name Cane Ashby. The other child, whose true identity remains unknown, was raised as Phillip and eventually married Nina. Following his wedding to Lily Winters, Cane recalled his telephone conversation two years earlier with a man regarding their joint plan to con Jill and Katherine. The man bore a startling resemblance to the supposedly deceased Phillip. It was revealed that Phillip was indeed the other gentleman, and that he is still very much alive; unknown to everyone except Cane.

Nina shocks Katherine and Jill by stating that she is having Phillip III&#x27;s body exhumed for a DNA test. She explains that her motives are not only to find out if the body is actually that of Phillip III, but to obtain some crucial information about her son. Nina informs Jill and Katherine that before being deployed in Iraq, her son had a physical and explained some symptoms he had been experiencing. The doctor asked if he had any family history of the deadly Huntington&#x27;s disease. She explains that she isn&#x27;t a carrier of the disease, and if his father wasn&#x27;t either then Phillip IV will be in the clear. Jill informs Nina that the results from the previous exhumation of Phillip III&#x27;s body should still be on file at the lab. After a couple of phone calls, it was revealed that the lab had no record of such a test, and the doctor who signed the autopsy report that Jill had on file had previously falsified forensic evidence and had disappeared. Nina goes back to her original plan of having Phillip III&#x27;s body exhumed. After much pleading from both Jill and Katherine, Nina agrees to only have the test for Phillip IV done rather than both DNA tests. Once Katherine and Jill leave the room however, Nina calls the lab back to order the second DNA test. The body of Phillip III is exhumed, and Nina requests to be present for the opening of the casket. When it is discovered that Phillip&#x27;s casket is empty and in fact never contained a corpse at all, Nina demands that Cane submit to DNA testing to verify his status as Jill&#x27;s biological son. Upon learning of Nina&#x27;s demand, Cane retrieves a vial of Phillip&#x27;s blood from a carousel of vials he has kept in a hidden freezer for use in DNA testing. Thus, it becomes apparent that Phillip III, not Cane, is Jill&#x27;s biological son. Nina confronts Cane accusing him of tampering with the blood samples for the DNA test. The blood had been frozen at one time, and the lab detected that. Cane finally breaks down and admits that he is not Phillip, but has no time to explain why he did what he did as Phillip III makes his grand return to Genoa City. Nina stands there with a horrified look upon her face as she sees her husband who was long thought deceased standing before her very much alive.

When Phillip appears, Nina is shocked, and Katherine collapses. Phillip briefly disappears, but is found at the hospital by Murphy, who keeps him there until Nina arrives. They all go into Katherine&#x27;s hospital room to have a sort of family meeting. Nina listens as Phillip explains why he and Cane deceived everyone. When Phillip explains that he didn&#x27;t want to live the life he had 20 years earlier. Nina is furious at Phillip for faking his death, leaving her to raise their son by herself. Phillip claims that he faked his own death for his son, stating that he wouldn&#x27;t have been a good father while suicidal and alcoholic. Nina, Jill and Katherine are left in a very familiar place, in a hospital room, filled with pain, rage and guilt, exactly the same as 20 years earlier when Phillip &quot;died&quot;.

Nina then demands more answers from Phillip, who is reluctant to reveal anything else. He follows her when she storms out of the Chancellor Mansion, and tells her to ask him anything she wants. After their conversation, Phillip reveals that he always wanted to call Nina and their son but didn&#x27;t know what to say. He then reveals that he is gay, and has always been. Nina seems to support him, and even convinces him to tell Jill and Katherine. Phillip IV returned from his tour of duty in Iraq, now going by the nickname Chance. This allowed for Chance to finally meet his father, but the two get into an argument. Nina wanted Phillip and Chance to develop relationship, but Phillip wanted Nina to let things be. Over time Phillip and Chance develop a relationship. Yet, Phillip ended up moving back to Australia, but returns occasionally.

Nina then began dating Paul Williams. Christine returns to Genoa City fully aware about the truth about Nina&#x27;s son being Ronan Malloy, an FBI agent working undercover at the Genoa City Police Department. However, for security reasons, Christine cannot tell Nina. Ronan and Chance became enemies at the department as Chance thought Ronan was a corrupt cop. Chance ended up being framed for drug possession and pleaded guilty in order to infiltrate corrupt police schemes. Chance is later released on bail.

At the premiere Gloria and Jeffrey Bardwell&#x27;s nightclub, Gloworm, Paul and Christine shared a kiss in remembrance of it being their wedding anniversary. Nina sees this and disappointingly walks away. The next day, when Nina sees the two of them she believes that the two of them had sex. The two of them deeply apologizes to her and assure her that they did not have sex. However Paul and Christine later kiss again almost to the point of them having sex. Christine abruptly leaves with Paul chasing after her. Nina sees Paul chasing after Christine. Paul confess to Nina about this. Nina is so mad slaps Paul on his face and storm out the room. Paul later begs for Nina&#x27;s forgiveness and reminds her that he is still committed to finding her son. However, Chance is accidentally shot by Ronan and is pronounced dead at the scene just as Nina finally discovered the truth about Ronan.

It was revealed that Chance faked his death and entered into the Witness Protection Program. Only his parents, Nina and Phillip, as well as Ronan and Christine knew before Chance later returned to donate his kidney to Ronan. When Chance returned, Katherine, Jill, as well as everyone else found out about Chance. He left Witness Protection before he left again to pursue a career at the Pentagon. In 2012, When Paul is arrested for the shooting death of his son Ricky, Nina returns for moral support. She remains in town until Paul is proven to have only shot Ricky because he was threatening the life of Eden Baldwin. She is ready to continue a relationship with Paul until she sees him with Christine and leaves him and Genoa City.

In September 2013, Nina returned to Genoa City for Katherine Chancellor&#x27;s memorial service. She made her peace with Paul and Christine on the advice of a letter written by Katherine before her death. The service ended with an impromptu wedding ceremony between Paul and Christine, in which Nina ended up being Christine&#x27;s maid of honor. She returned the following August for Katherine&#x27;s remembrance party.

<doc id="694952" wikidata="Q4454958" url="?curid=694952" title="Min-max theorem">
<text>In linear algebra and functional analysis, the min-max theorem, or variational theorem, or Courant–Fischer–Weyl min-max principle, is a result that gives a variational characterization of eigenvalues of compact Hermitian operators on Hilbert spaces. It can be viewed as the starting point of many results of similar nature.

This article first discusses the finite-dimensional case and its applications before considering compact operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. 
We will see that for compact operators, the proof of the main theorem uses essentially the same idea from the finite-dimensional argument.

In the case that the operator is non-Hermitian, the theorem provides an equivalent characterization of the associated singular values. 
The min-max theorem can be extended to self-adjoint operators that are bounded below.

== Matrices ==

Let be a Hermitian matrix. As with many other variational results on eigenvalues, one considers the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient defined by

:formula_1

where denotes the Euclidean inner product on . 
Equivalently, the Rayleigh–Ritz quotient can be replaced by

:formula_2

The Rayleigh quotient of an eigenvector formula_3 is its associated eigenvalue formula_4 because formula_5. 
For a Hermitian matrix &quot;A&quot;, the range of the continuous functions &quot;RA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a compact interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] of the real line. The maximum &quot;b&quot; and the minimum &quot;a&quot; are the largest and smallest eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;, respectively. The min-max theorem is a refinement of this fact.

=== Min-max theorem ===

Let formula_6 be Hermitian on an inner product space formula_7 with dimension formula_8, with spectrum ordered in descending order formula_9.

Let formula_10 be the corresponding unit-length orthogonal eigenvectors.

Reverse the spectrum ordering, so that formula_11.

 \min _{\begin{array}{c} x \in \mathcal{M} \\ \|x\|=1 \end{array}}\langle x, A x\rangle\\
&amp;=\min _{\begin{array}{c} \mathcal{M} \subset V \\ \operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{M})=n-k+1 \end{array}} \max _{\begin{array}{c} x \in \mathcal{M} \\ \|x\|=1 \end{array}}\langle x, A x\rangle \text{. }
\end{aligned}&lt;/math&gt;

Define the partial trace formula_12 to be the trace of projection of formula_6 to formula_7. It is equal to formula_15 given an orthonormal basis of formula_7.

&lt;/math&gt;. This still exists. Etc. Now since formula_17, apply the induction hypothesis, there exists some formula_18 such that formula_19 Now formula_20 is the formula_21-th eigenvalue of formula_6 orthogonally projected down to formula_23. By Cauchy interlacing theorem, formula_24. Since formula_25, we’re done.

If formula_26, then we perform a similar construction. Let formula_27. If formula_28, then we can induct. Otherwise, we construct a partial flag sequence formula_29 By induction, there exists some formula_30, such that formula_31 thus
formula_32 And it remains to find some formula_33 such that formula_34.

If formula_35, then any formula_36 would work. Otherwise, if formula_37, then any formula_38 would work, and so on. If none of these work, then it means formula_28, contradiction.

This have some corollaries:




=== Counterexample in the non-Hermitian case ===

Let &quot;N&quot; be the nilpotent matrix

:formula_40

Define the Rayleigh quotient formula_41 exactly as above in the Hermitian case. Then it is easy to see that the only eigenvalue of &quot;N&quot; is zero, while the maximum value of the Rayleigh quotient is . That is, the maximum value of the Rayleigh quotient is larger than the maximum eigenvalue.

== Applications ==

=== Min-max principle for singular values ===

The singular values {&quot;σk&quot;} of a square matrix &quot;M&quot; are the square roots of the eigenvalues of &quot;M&quot;*&quot;M&quot; (equivalently &quot;MM*&quot;). An immediate consequence of the first equality in the min-max theorem is:

:formula_42

Similarly,

:formula_43

Here formula_44 denotes the &quot;k&quot;th entry in the decreasing sequence of the singular values, so that formula_45.

=== Cauchy interlacing theorem ===
Let be a symmetric &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix. The &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, is called a compression of if there exists an orthogonal projection &quot;P&quot; onto a subspace of dimension &quot;m&quot; such that &quot;PAP*&quot; = &quot;B&quot;. The Cauchy interlacing theorem states:

:Theorem. If the eigenvalues of are , and those of &quot;B&quot; are , then for all ,
::formula_46

This can be proven using the min-max principle. Let &quot;βi&quot; have corresponding eigenvector &quot;bi&quot; and &quot;Sj&quot; be the &quot;j&quot; dimensional subspace then

:formula_47

According to first part of min-max, On the other hand, if we define then

:formula_48

where the last inequality is given by the second part of min-max.

When , we have , hence the name &quot;interlacing&quot; theorem.

=== Lidskii&#x27;s inequality ===
 

Note that formula_49. In other words, formula_50 where formula_51 means majorization. By the Schur convexity theorem, we then have
== Compact operators ==

Let be a compact, Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. Recall that the spectrum of such an operator (the set of eigenvalues) is a set of real numbers whose only possible cluster point is zero. 
It is thus convenient to list the positive eigenvalues of as

:formula_52

where entries are repeated with multiplicity, as in the matrix case. (To emphasize that the sequence is decreasing, we may write formula_53.) 
When &quot;H&quot; is infinite-dimensional, the above sequence of eigenvalues is necessarily infinite. 
We now apply the same reasoning as in the matrix case. Letting &quot;Sk&quot; ⊂ &quot;H&quot; be a &quot;k&quot; dimensional subspace, we can obtain the following theorem.

:Theorem (Min-Max). Let be a compact, self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space , whose positive eigenvalues are listed in decreasing order . Then:
::formula_54

A similar pair of equalities hold for negative eigenvalues.

 \max_{x \in S_{k-1}^{\perp}, \|x\|=1} (Ax, x) \ge \lambda_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Pick &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 = span{&quot;u&quot;1, ..., &quot;u&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1} and we deduce

:formula_55

== Self-adjoint operators ==

The min-max theorem also applies to (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operators. Recall the essential spectrum is the spectrum without isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. 
Sometimes we have some eigenvalues below the essential spectrum, and we would like to approximate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

:Theorem (Min-Max). Let &quot;A&quot; be self-adjoint, and let formula_56 be the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; below the essential spectrum. Then

formula_57.

If we only have &quot;N&quot; eigenvalues and hence run out of eigenvalues, then we let formula_58 (the bottom of the essential spectrum) for &quot;n&gt;N&quot;, and the above statement holds after replacing min-max with inf-sup.

:Theorem (Max-Min). Let &quot;A&quot; be self-adjoint, and let formula_56 be the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; below the essential spectrum. Then

formula_60.

If we only have &quot;N&quot; eigenvalues and hence run out of eigenvalues, then we let formula_58 (the bottom of the essential spectrum) for &quot;n &gt; N&quot;, and the above statement holds after replacing max-min with sup-inf.

The proofs use the following results about self-adjoint operators:

:Theorem. Let &quot;A&quot; be self-adjoint. Then formula_62 for formula_63 if and only if formula_64.

:Theorem. If &quot;A&quot; is self-adjoint, then

formula_65

and

formula_66.

<text>Cook&#x27;s Bay is the southernmost bay of Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada. Most of the southern part of the bay is within the jurisdiction of Georgina, a town in the Regional Municipality of York. Its western end is in Simcoe County, and a small portion from the mouth of the Holland River to the Simcoe County border is within Bradford West Gwillimbury. The largest community on the shores of the bay is Keswick.

It was named by John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, for James Cook, who had served as master aboard in 1759 under the command of Captain John Simcoe, the Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s father.

The bay is used for fishing, and is especially known for yellow perch. It attracts windsurfers and kitesurfers throughout the year, and its northern end features many cottages that are part of Ontario&#x27;s cottage country. Marinas and motel accommodations are available.

<text>The Maid of the Mist is a sightseeing boat tour of Niagara Falls, N.Y., U.S.A., starting and ending on the American side, crossing briefly into Canada during a portion of the trip.

James V. Glynn is chairman and chief executive officer of Maid of the Mist Corp. He joined Maid of the Mist in 1950 as a ticket seller and purchased the company in 1971.

There have been sightseeing boats at Niagara since 1846. Steam-powered boats were replaced by diesel-powered craft in 1955. All were named &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; until 2020, when company president Christopher M. Glynn introduced two new boats powered by lithium-ion battery-powered electric motors; these were named &quot;James V. Glynn&quot;, after the CEO; and &quot;Nikola Tesla&quot;, for the engineer who developed a type of alternating current (AC) motor. Tesla&#x27;s patents were licensed by George Westinghouse, whose company later won the bid to build the first AC power plant at Niagara Falls. 

The name, &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot;, could be a reference to the Iroquois myth of Lelawala.

==History==
=== The United States ===
The original &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; was built at a landing near Niagara Falls on the American side of the border. The boat was christened in 1846 as a border-crossing ferry; its first trip was on September 18, 1846. The two-stage barge-like steamer was designed primarily as a link for a proposed ferry service between New York City and Toronto. It was a 72-foot-long side-wheeler with an 18-foot beam which was powered by steam produced from a wood- and coal-fired boiler. It could carry up to 100 passengers.

The ferry did well until 1848, when the opening of a suspension bridge between the United States and Canada cut into the ferry traffic. It was then that the owners decided to make the journey a sightseeing trip, plotting a journey closer to the Falls.

The present day Maid of the Mist Corporation was formed in 1884 by Captain R. F. Carter and Frank LaBlond, who invested in a new Maid that would launch in 1885. Captain Carter and Mr. LaBlond hired Alfred H. White from Port Robinson, Ontario to build the new ship. A letter in the archives of the Buffalo Historical Society from Mr. LaBlond to Alfred White says that they are well pleased with the vessel and asks Alfred to add a wale onto the boat.

The service is run by Maid of the Mist Corp. of Niagara Falls, New York. Maid of the Mist has been owned by the Glynn family since 1971.

James V. Glynn is chairman and chief executive officer of Maid of the Mist Corp. Glynn joined Maid of the Mist in 1950 as a ticket seller, and purchased the company in 1971. During his tenure, Maid of the Mist expanded operations, achieving ten-fold growth.

=== Canada ===
Access to the river-level attraction on the Canadian side was provided by the Maid of the Mist Incline Railway, a funicular railway, between 1894 and 1990, to travel between street level and the boat dock. As this service proved increasingly inadequate in transporting the growing passenger base of the 1990s, four high-speed elevators replaced the railway in 1991. On the American side, the dock is reached by four elevators enclosed in the observation tower. 

The Russel Brothers of Owen Sound, Ontario made two all-steel Maids for the Niagara Falls Gorge, in 1955 and 1956. The first one is now based in Parry Sound, Ont. and runs dinner cruises and day excursions. The second &quot;Maid&quot; was sold in 1983 to the United Pentecostal Church of Ontario and destined for missionary service in the Amazon. &quot;Maid of the Mist II&quot; took part in the July 9, 1960, rescue of Roger Woodward, a seven-year-old boy who became the first person to survive a plunge over the Horseshoe Falls with nothing but a life jacket. &quot;Maid of the Mist II&quot; served as a Maid of the Mist until 1983. Subsequently she was relocated to the Amazon River, where she served as a missionary ship for some years.

A partial history of &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; is featured in the IMAX film &quot;&quot;.

==Boats==
===Original ships===

The first series boats to bear the &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; moniker were steam-powered wooden-hulled ferries. These were in use until an early-season fire destroyed the last of them in 1955.

First &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; 
* Years of service: 1846–1854
* Type: double-stack steamboat ferry
* Engine: one sidewheel steam

Second &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot;

===Diesel vessels===

After a fire destroyed the last of the wooden-hulled steamers, they were replaced by steel-hulled, diesel-powered ferries, launched in 1955 and 1956. About every 20 years or so, new ships were added to the fleet, of increasingly larger capacity; the initial &quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; held only 101 passengers, while the last of the diesel-powered vessels, &quot;Maid of the Mist VII&quot;, could hold up to 600. The last of these were retired in 2019, to be replaced by an electric-powered fleet that can both hold 600 passengers.

<text>InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (IVCF) is an evangelical Christian student movement with affiliate groups on university campuses in U.S.. It is a member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. 

It is a collective campus ministry found in hundreds of American colleges whose collegiate members involve themselves in Christian student activist movements.

==Organization==
InterVarsity is governed by a board of directors. Tom Lin became the eighth president of InterVarsity on August 10, 2016. The president works with a team of five Executive Vice Presidents. InterVarsity is a tax exempt organization under the provisions of Section 501(C)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In the fiscal year ending 30 June 2018, InterVarsity had $107M in revenue (with over 70% coming from charitable donations) and $106.6M in expenditures.

InterVarsity is a charter member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), and uses more than 85% of its revenue for staff-worker salaries and other on-campus work. InterVarsity was rated 4 stars (out of 4) by Charity Navigator for eight straight years. Michael Thatcher, the president of Charity Navigator, reported: &quot;Only 3% of the charities we evaluate have received at least 8 consecutive 4-star evaluations, indicating that InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA outperforms most other charities in America.&quot; In 2019 InterVarsity slipped just below the cut-off for the four-star rating, and based on the latest available IRS Form 990 data (for Fiscal Year 2020) is currently rated at three stars by Charity Navigator. However, InterVarsity continued to maintain a 100 percent score in Accountability and Transparency.

InterVarsity strives to maintain the highest level of accountability with its ministry partners and is also rated by sites such as Guidestar and MinistryWatch. InterVarsity (as of 2018) met 18 of the 20 Better Business Bureau&#x27;s &quot;Standards for Charity Accountability&quot;.

==History==
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA became an official organization in November, 1941. But the organization traces its roots to a movement of British university students, starting at Cambridge University in 1877. The movement spread to Canada before reaching the U.S. In 1938 Stacey Woods, the Canadian Inter-Varsity director, met with students on the University of Michigan campus. As an immediate result of that visit, students formed the first InterVarsity chapter in the United States. InterVarsity&#x27;s first three staff members came on loan from Canada, and Stacey Woods served as the organization&#x27;s General Secretary (CEO). In 1947 InterVarsity USA became one of ten founding members of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, a federation of national Christian student movements. By 1950 there were 35 staff workers serving students in 499 InterVarsity chapters and by the early seventies, the on-campus staff had grown to more than 200.

In September 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa ruled that the University of Iowa violated the First Amendment when it expelled the group from campus for requiring its leaders to uphold Christian beliefs. A similar ruling was issued against Wayne State University in April 2021.

==Statement of Faith==
In 2016, InterVarsity clarified its requirements for staff, asking that they affirm traditional, orthodox views of sexuality that are shared by most evangelical denominations. Staff are asked to affirm a twenty-page document which affirms the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament sexual ethic that limits sexual expression to marriage between a man and a woman. However, this change in policy has prompted controversy, especially from LGBTQ Christians and their supporters.

Of the 772 campuses where InterVarsity is present, many have multiple chapters which might focus individually on Greek life students, international students, nursing students, graduate students, athletes, artists, and members of ethnic minorities, or be more generalized depending on the campus. These include 71 ethnic-specific chapters ministering to Blacks, Asians, Native Americans, Filipinos, and Latinos. Of the 34,750 active InterVarsity students, 15,198, or 44%, identify themselves as ethnic minority or multiracial students.

Nurses Christian Fellowship (NCF) is unique among the ministries of InterVarsity; it is a professional organization as well as a student ministry. In addition to campus ministry, NCF offers continuing education courses and the professional publication, &quot;Journal of Christian Nursing&quot;, to practicing nurses.

===Bible study===
Bible study has always been an important part of InterVarsity&#x27;s campus ministry. InterVarsity staff worker Paul Byer is credited with developing the Manuscript Study method of inductive Bible study, a useful tool for inductive Bible studies. After graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in architecture, Byer became one of the leading forces in InterVarsity, as both a campus staff worker and as the West Coast Regional Director, and was the developer of the Manuscript Study method. Through his innovative approach to Bible Study, extensive mentoring, and long tenure he helped shape the theology and culture of the entire movement. The Manuscript Study method continues to be used heavily by InterVarsity as one of many tools to help students investigate and learn from the teachings of the Bible.

Other early staff members laid more of the foundation for InterVarsity&#x27;s commitment to Bible study. Jane Hollingsworth learned inductive Bible study in seminary and in turn trained staff members in the 1940s. She wrote the first Bible study guide published by InterVarsity, &quot;Discovering the Gospel of Mark&quot;. In the 1960s, veteran staff member Barbara Boyd developed what became the Bible and Life Training Courses, experienced by decades of students.

===Missions===
InterVarsity, as a member movement, participates in the global student ministry network, the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), by sending staff and recent graduates to work under the authority of local IFES staff in countries around the world.

===Training===
InterVarsity operates several training centers, Campus by the Sea, Catalina Island, CA; Toah Nipi, Rindge, NH; Cedar Campus, Cedarville, MI; Bear Trap Ranch, Colorado Springs, CO; and, until recently, Forest Springs, WI. These camps are used for weekend conferences during the school year, week-long training sessions at the beginning and end of summer break, and faculty and alumni retreats.

==InterVarsity Press==

In 1947 the InterVarsity/USA Board of Trustees determined that the Fellowship should develop its own publishing arm. With this action, InterVarsity Press (IVP) became an official part of InterVarsity&#x27;s ministry, overseeing the publication and distribution of books, booklets and Bible study guides in support of the campus work.

<doc id="695004" wikidata="Q1724922" url="?curid=695004" title="Larry Ridley">
<text>Laurence “Larry” Howard Ridley II (born September 3, 1937) is an American jazz bassist and music educator. He is a pioneer of music education, so much that he was eventually inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Larry was born on September 3, 1937, in Indianapolis, Indiana. Music became an important of his life since he was five years old. Larry&#x27;s mother would pay seventy-five cents for Ruth McArthur to give him violin lessons. McArthur had been renown in Indianapolis for helping push African Americans forward in the music community. She had opened a music school for those students who were being negatively impacted by segregation within the city&#x27;s schools. This represented a chance to Larry to open his eyes to the world of music and build a classical music background. However, this was not the end of musicians taking him under their wing at a young age.

Ben Hollman, who was the father of Larry&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s wife, introduced him to jazz and blues. Because this was the early stages when jazz was gaining more popularity within the United States, it was more important to gain an understanding of blues as that genre was heavily influencing jazz&#x27;s development. To become even more versatile as a young musician, Larry also met and asked bassist Monk Montgomery for lessons. Clearly, since he was young, it was apparent how important and valuable music education was to Larry.

After graduating from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis, he enrolled in 1955 in Indiana University. He was fortunate enough to earn a violin scholarship that would help cover his continued education at the school of music at the university. During his time there, Larry had the opportunity to be a part of jazz groups and to play with the David Baker Band. When Larry had enrolled in the university, it was rare for jazz to be a part of an institution&#x27;s music program. In an interview, he stated that &quot;the only thing that had been set up on sort of like a university type level was the Berklee College of Music, which was started in 1947.&quot; When he arrived at the university, he quickly realized that this institution could offer him countless opportunities to sharpen his skills. He was able to perform numerous times with the school&#x27;s symphony orchestra and opera orchestra. Larry was able to gain knowledge on different styles of music, but he still honed in on jazz. Along with a group of students, they would gather in the rehearsal halls to practice jazz. Larry also met many musicians who came from the European classical tradition that played all around the world, and they would come to the university to teach classes.

== Career - Musician ==
In 1957, Larry organized a jazz band that was called the Jazz Contemporaries. His fellow members were Freddie Hubbard, James Spaulding, Paul Parker, and Walter Miller. The group of musicians was underaged, but they were still able to perform six nights a week at George&#x27;s Bar. In the early 1960s, Larry relocated to New York to pursue a musical career in jazz. He became extremely involved in the New York jazz scene in an attempt to help it grow. During that decade, he appeared on records with Hubbard, Roy Haynes, Horace Silver, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Jackie McLean, and Dexter Gordon. During the 1970s, he was able to record his first album where he was the bandleader this time. In addition, Larry was a part of meaningful collaborations as a sideman for James Moody and Duke Ellington. He became the bassist for Thelonious Monk as well.

During his career as a musician, the performances he has held closest to his heart were his yearly concerts at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City. These concerts were tributes to three pianists he played with throughout his career: Duke Pearson, Sonny Clark, and Kenny Drew. Because all three had already passed away, he felt that it was the least he could do for them since they had no presence in the commercial scene anymore. He credits &quot;the creator&quot; with having given him the opportunity to get to know these people and learn from all of them about he could grow both as a person and a musician. As a result, Larry felt that holding these tribute concerts was something that he was moved to do to make sure they never fade away and become anonymous musicians.

Furthermore, the Schomburg Center was a special institution for Larry. He held it in very high regard as it was one of &quot;the world&#x27;s leading institutions as far as the type of information they have that relates to African or black culture.&quot; To him, it is one of the best displays of &quot;intellectual and artistic artifacts&quot;. As a way of showing respect to the invaluable institution that the Schomburg Center had become, Larry would try to mix education with his performances. When he would design the programs for his concerts, he would make notes giving overviews of the musicians he would be honoring throughout his performance.

== Career - Educator ==
As previously mentioned, music education was of utmost importance during his development. In 1971 he became a professor of music at Rutgers. He became extremely involved with the Rutgers Institute for Jazz Studies to help make it as important of a repository for intellect and history like the Schomburg Center. He was one of the first active, African American musicians who became involved in the education aspect of the industry. Larry, in addition, was a founding member of the jazz faculty at Rutgers. He brought in to the program a multitude of jazz musicians: Ted Dunbar, Kenny Barron, Don Friedman, Jimmy Giuffre, Freddie Waits, Michael Carvin, Frank Foster, and more. Again, his source of inspiration behind aiding in establishing this institution at the university was that jazz programs were not popular back when he was in school. In addition, Larry had seen ads for institutions with &quot;jazz degrees&quot; that said you had the opportunity to study with the greatest jazz musicians, but he said he would never recognize any of the names on there. As a result, he ensured to bring to Rutgers established and known musicians who could share professional and personal insight with all aspiring musicians. Another shortcoming of other attempts to establish a jazz degree was that they failed to incorporate the spiritual aesthetic of jazz, which Larry viewed as &quot;the feeling of the music that comes from Mother Africa through the whole African American experience.&quot; To him, a critical part of true jazz was having soul and spirituality in every song you performed. He viewed jazz as a platform to showcase to the world what life was like as an African American trying to live out the American dream, an idea that many musicians could relate to.

Larry had the credentials to undertake the formation of the undergraduate and graduate jazz performance programs at Rutgers. Even though he had enrolled initially at Indiana University, he transferred to New York University to obtain his Bachelor&#x27;s in Music Education. He also earned his Master&#x27;s in Cultural Policy at Empire State College and a Doctor of Performing Arts degree at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. What inspired him though to get his Bachelor&#x27;s in music education was that he felt that jazz needed a program similar to the general music education. He believed that the music academy &quot;was not going to ever accept jazz a legitimate art form or music because there was always this thing about, &#x27;Oh do you play legit?&#x27; or &#x27;Do you play serious music?&#x27;&quot;.

One of the key lessons that Lester attempted to incorporate in the curriculum he developed was that you have to stay humble. He would tell his students, &quot;Take your ego and put it in your back pocket and sit on it and just keep your humbleness so you really understand and that you keep learning.&quot; He believed that an ego was the biggest thing that could hinder a musician as it could lead them to blocking out everyone. Humility opens the eyes and ears to feedback and lessons that can transform a musician&#x27;s perspective. Another key teaching Larry instilled in the programs is the importance of using music to tell a story. The technique may be impressive, but the life experiences that influence the songs themselves are the true substance. Again, that spiritual aspect is what will show the audience who you are as a musician.

== Influence - African American Jazz Caucus ==
Larry was the primary founder in 1977 for the Black Jazz Music Caucus of the National Association of Jazz Educators, which now operates under the African American Jazz Caucus (AAJC), where he later served as the executive director. The purpose of having established this caucus was to increase the &quot;representation of African American Jazz artists and educators within the larger body of the Jazz Educators Association.&quot; One of Larry&#x27;s personal motivations for being so involved was because he loves music, and he had the opportunity during his come-up to be mentored by Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Horace Silver. He wanted to utilize this additional platform to help provide the support that he received during his development. The lessons he learned impacted positively his career as a musician and as an educator.

One of the early goals of the African American Jazz Caucus was to give support and resources to both African American artists and educators at elementary, secondary, and higher educational institutions. In addition, Larry would help organize workshops and performances at conferences for the National Association of Jazz Educators. Like he did when he established the jazz faculty at Rutgers, he would invite renowned African American artists in an attempt to provide reliable mentorship opportunities for aspiring musicians and educators. The AAJC constantly tried to tackle any challenges that members can face when it comes to educating students. Some of these challenges included the &quot;creation of employment opportunities, the sustenance and protection of employment and programming, the allocation of adequate resources, and, the creation and monitoring of curricula that rightfully acknowledge and position the history and contributions of African Americans as the progenitors of the Jazz art form.&quot;

Furthermore, Larry and the AAJC ensured that jazz educators across the country recognized and acknowledged, to this day, the African American cultural influences upon which jazz was built around. He wanted educators to understand all ways that African Americans contributed to jazz&#x27;s development in the United States: spirituality, individuality, diversity, improvisation, and theory, to name a few.

<text>The Penny Black Project is a Microsoft Research project that tries to find effective and practical ways of fighting spam. Because identifying spams consumes a recipient&#x27;s time, the idea is to make the sender of emails &quot;pay&quot; a certain amount for sending them. The currency or the mode of payment could be CPU cycles, Turing tests or memory cycles. Such a payment would limit spammers&#x27; ability to send out large quantities of emails quickly.

The project&#x27;s name is derived from the Penny Black, the world&#x27;s first adhesive stamp used for prepaid postage.

==Objective==
The goal of the project is to move the e-mail costs from the receiver to the sender. The general idea is that if the sender must prove that they have expended a certain amount of effort specifically for the receiver and the message alone.

The project aims to devise a method to do this without introducing additional challenge-response mechanisms and third parties, and without requiring extra maintenance and updates, while retaining the current architecture of the e-mail system.

==Ticket server==
One of the project&#x27;s ideas was the &quot;ticket server&quot;, a credit-based method for validating emails. Tickets would be required to perform actions, such as sending emails. There are three operations the ticket server provides: &quot;request ticket&quot;, &quot;cancel ticket&quot;, and &quot;refund ticket&quot;.

The server would allow the user to request a ticket in exchange for a proof of work: expending CPU cycles solving hard algorithms with processing power, Turing tests, or even just by paying money. The server could also cancel a ticket. For example, after receiving an email with a ticket, the receiver could request the ticket to be cancelled so it cannot be reused. The person who cancels a ticket also has the option to refund the ticket to the sender. This causes the original sender to regain a new ticket. For example, a user might refund a ticket that came with an email if it was not spam.

Using this, friendly and trusted emails would have little to no cost as tickets would be frequently refunded. However, spammers would be required to invest either a lot of computing time or money in order to create enough tickets to send large numbers of e-mails.

<doc id="695020" wikidata="Q1346403" url="?curid=695020" title="Epaphroditus Champion">
<text>Epaphroditus Champion (April 6, 1756 – December 22, 1834) was an American politician and military officer from Connecticut. He served as a U.S. Representative from Connecticut.

==Early life==
Champion was born in Colchester in the Connecticut Colony, son of Colonel Henry Champion and Deborah (Brainard) Champion. He was educated both by private tutors and in the common schools.

Champion&#x27;s brother Henry Champion was a major in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and served in the Connecticut state house of representatives.
==Career==

During the American Revolutionary War, Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull directed Champion&#x27;s father, Connecticut state commissary Colonel Henry Champion, to collect cattle and drive them to Valley Forge. Champion helped his father gather a herd of 300 cattle at Hartford, Connecticut and drive them west to King&#x27;s Ferry, across the Hudson, into New Jersey, across the Delaware to Washington&#x27;s famished troops west of the Schuylkill. They were devoured in five days prompting Champion to remark that the cattle were so thoroughly eaten that &quot;you might have made a knife out of every bone.&quot; Champion was named assistant commissary to Trumbull in 1776, and was the first Commissary General of the Continental Army.

Champion moved to East Haddam, Connecticut in 1782. He served as a captain in the Twenty-fourth Regiment of the Connecticut State militia from 1784 to 1792, as major from 1793 to 1794, as lieutenant colonel from 1795 to 1798, and as brigadier general of the Seventh Brigade from 1800 to 1803.

He worked as a merchant, shipowner, exporter and importer. He was successful in conducting trade in the West Indies. Champion was a member of the Connecticut state assembly from 1791 to 1806. He was elected as a Federalist candidate to the Tenth United States Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1807, to March 3, 1817. After serving in Congress, he resumed his former business activities. Champion served as commissary general of provisions for army pensioners in 1832.

==Personal life==

In 1781, Champion married Lucretia Hubbard (1760–1836). Together, they had three children:

* Lucretia Champion (1783–1882)
* Clarissa Champion (1785–1801)
* Epaphroditus Champion Jr. (1786–1841).

Champion died on December 22, 1834, in East Haddam, Connecticut. He is interred in Riverview Cemetery in East Haddam. His epitaph reads, &quot;Talents, benevolence and integrity characterized his spotless life.&quot;

===Legacy===
Champion&#x27;s home in East Haddam is included in the East Haddam Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The home is named the General Epaphroditus Champion House and was built in a late-Georgian style.

<doc id="695023" wikidata="Q623724" url="?curid=695023" title="Meet the Parents">
<text>Meet the Parents is a 2000 American comedy film written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg and directed by Jay Roach. It stars Ben Stiller as a nurse who suffers a series of unfortunate events while visiting his girlfriend&#x27;s parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner). Teri Polo stars as Greg&#x27;s girlfriend and Owen Wilson stars as Pam&#x27;s ex-boyfriend.

The film is a remake of the 1992 film &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; directed by Greg Glienna and produced by Jim Vincent. Glienna – who also played the original film&#x27;s protagonist – and Mary Ruth Clarke wrote the screenplay. Universal Pictures purchased the rights to Glienna&#x27;s film with the intent of creating a new version. Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time. Roach read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct it. At that time, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing while Jim Carrey was interested in playing the lead role. The studio only offered the film to Roach once Spielberg and Carrey left the project.

Released in the United States and Canada on October 6, 2000 and distributed by Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures internationally through United International Pictures, the film earned back its initial budget of $55 million in only 11 days. It became one of the highest-grossing films of 2000, earning over $165 million in North America and over $330 million worldwide. It was well received by film critics and viewers alike, winning several awards and earning additional nominations. Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People&#x27;s Choice Awards. It was followed by the sequels &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; (2004) and &quot;Little Fockers&quot; (2010), and the reality television show &quot;Meet My Folks&quot; and the sitcom &quot;In-Laws&quot;, which both debuted on NBC in 2002.

==Plot==
Greg Focker, a Jewish American nurse living in Chicago, intends to propose to his girlfriend, daycare teacher Pam Byrnes. He chooses to get her father&#x27;s blessing at her sister Debbie&#x27;s wedding at their parents&#x27; house on Long Island, and plans to propose to her in front of her family. This plan is put on hold when the airline company loses his luggage, which contains the engagement ring.

At the Byrnes&#x27;s, Greg meets Pam&#x27;s father Jack, mother Dina, and beloved cat Jinx. Despite displaying a friendly demeanor towards Greg, Jack is immediately suspicious of him and is critical of his choice of career as a nurse. Greg gifts Jack an extremely rare flower, but he does not recognize it, although he&#x27;s a &#x27;retired florist&#x27;.

Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after he receives an impromptu lie detector test from Jack. Pam explains that Jack&#x27;s profession as a florist is a cover, and he is actually a retired CIA operative who interrogated double agents.

Meeting the rest of Pam&#x27;s family and friends, including Debbie&#x27;s future in-laws, Greg still feels like an outsider. He also becomes insecure about his relationship with Pam when he learns she was previously engaged. Her ex-fiancé Kevin is amiable, handsome, wealthy, and still on friendly terms with her. He is also the Best Man in Debbie&#x27;s wedding.

Despite efforts to impress her family, Greg&#x27;s inadvertent actions make him an easy target for ridicule. Greg accidentally injures Debbie during a pool volleyball game, floods the backyard with sewage, breaks an urn containing the ashes of Jack&#x27;s mother, and sets the wedding altar on fire. Jack also suspects Greg is a marijuana user after he endorses the marijuana interpretation of &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;. Jack&#x27;s suspicion increases when he catches Pam&#x27;s brother Denny retrieving a marijuana pipe from a jacket that he loaned Greg, which Denny hastily lies about being Greg&#x27;s.

Later, Greg loses Jinx, so temporarily replaces him with a near-identical stray, whose tail he spray-paints and who makes a mess of the house and destroys Debbie&#x27;s wedding dress. Greg&#x27;s deception is exposed when a neighbor finds the real Jinx, so the entire Byrnes family demand Greg leave Long Island.

Jack accuses Greg of lying about taking the Medical College Admission Test because his CIA contacts could not find any record of a Gregory Focker. Greg retaliates by revealing he has seen Jack engaging in secret meetings, receiving passports, and speaking in Thai. He deduces that Jack has taken on a new CIA mission, only for Jack to angrily reveal that he was arranging a surprise honeymoon in Thailand for Debbie and her fiancé Bob.

A devastated Greg drives to the airport to return to Chicago, but is detained by airport security for refusing to again check his suitcase, which is too large to be a carry-on, and taking his anger out on a flight attendant. Back at the Byrnes&#x27;s house, Pam shows her parents copies of Greg&#x27;s MCAT transcript which his parents faxed her; the CIA found no record of Greg because his legal name is Gaylord, not Gregory.

Jack still believes that Greg is an unsuitable husband for Pam, but Dina lectures him over his consistent disapproval of any man Pam brings home. After hearing Pam make a heartfelt phone call to Greg, apologizing for not sticking up for him, Jack realizes she truly loves him.

Jack rushes to the airport and convinces security to release Greg. The two clear the air with each other, with Greg citing his fear of living up to Jack’s unattainable standards. After ensuring Greg’s loyalty and devotion to Pam, Jack finally accepts him, and asks him to be his son-in-law.

After returning to the Byrnes home, Greg proposes to Pam, as Jack and Dina listen in from their bedroom, agreeing that they should now meet Greg&#x27;s parents. After Debbie&#x27;s wedding, Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed around the house, in which Greg vents his frustrations with Jack, and also exposes Denny as a marijuana user.

==Cast==
==Themes==

Greg Focker is a middle-class Jewish nurse whose social and cultural position is juxtaposed against the Byrnes family of upper-middle class White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. With respect to Greg as a Jew and a nurse when compared to the Byrnes and Banks families, a distinct cultural gap is created and subsequently widened. The cultural differences are often highlighted, and Greg repeatedly made aware of them. This serves to achieve comedic effect through character development and has also been commented upon as being indicative of thematic portrayal of Jewish characters&#x27; roles in modern film as well as being a prime example of how male nurses are portrayed in media. Speaking about character development in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, director Jay Roach stated that he wanted an opportunity to &quot;do character-driven comedy&quot; and &quot;to create realistic characters, but heighten the comedic situations and predicaments.&quot;

Vincent Brook observes mainstream Hollywood cinema&#x27;s tendency since the 1990s of incorporating Jewish liminality and &quot;popularizing the Jew.&quot; He explains the &quot;manly Jewish triumph&quot; of characters like Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s David Levinson in &quot;Independence Day&quot; and labels it as a &quot;certain answer to America&#x27;s yearnings for a new Jewish hero.&quot; This stands in direct contrast to the or &quot;the Jewish fool&quot; which was seen to have been revitalized in the mid-1990s after faltering since the 1960s. The schlemiel, Brook explains, is an anti-hero in whose humiliation the audience finds supreme pleasure. Within that context, Brook describes Greg Focker&#x27;s character as &quot;the quintessential example of the postmodern schlemiel.&quot; The repeated embarrassing encounters that Greg faces with his girlfriend&#x27;s all-American family is compared to the example of Jason Biggs&#x27;s character Jim Levenstein of the &quot;American Pie&quot; film series where Levenstein is often the comedic centerpiece due to his repeated sexual embarrassments.
Anne Bower writes about Jewish characters at mealtime as part of the broader movement she believes started in the 1960s where filmmakers started producing work that explored the &quot;Jewish self-definition.&quot; She postulates that the dinner table becomes an arena where Jewish characters are often and most pointedly put into &quot;conflicts with their ethnic and sexual selves.&quot; She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food. In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song &quot;Day by Day&quot; from Act I of &quot;Godspell&quot;. Bower notes this scene as &quot;particularly important for establishing the cultural distance&quot; between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the social gap is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table; he shows up wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a bagel, which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.

Based on common misconceptions and stereotypes about men in nursing, Greg&#x27;s profession is repeatedly brought up by Jack in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker has come to be one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse. Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times, there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media. A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Jack is often seen openly criticizing Greg&#x27;s career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession. In their book &quot;Men in Nursing: History, Challenges, and Opportunities&quot; authors Chad O&#x27;Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal. Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing, Barbara Cherry in her book &quot;Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, &amp; Management&quot; called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse &quot;one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses&quot; and commented that Greg &quot;humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession.&quot; Sandy and Harry Summers in the book &quot;Saving Lives: Why the Media&#x27;s Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk&quot; postulate that Greg&#x27;s character, although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession, &quot;might have done more to rebut the stereotypes&quot; while also reporting that &quot;some men in nursing&quot; expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all.

==Production==

===Background===

The film is a remake of a 1992 independent film of the same name. Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke wrote the original story and screenplay. Glienna also directed and starred in the 76-minute film which was filmed on 16 mm film in 1991 and released the following year. The 1992 film also marked one of only several film roles played by comedian Emo Philips which he also helped produce. Film producer Elliot Grove, founder of Raindance Film Festival and the British Independent Film Awards, listed the original &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; on his personal Top Ten list of favorite films where he called it &quot;much funnier and tighter than the Hollywood version&quot;. The 1992 film was a featured entry in the 1995 Raindance Film Festival.

Producer Nancy Tenenbaum acquired the rights to the 1992 film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He brought it to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned the rights to the film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with &quot;Out of Sight&quot;.

===Writing===

Universal approached screenwriter Jim Herzfeld to expand the screenplay. Herzfeld expanded the modest script, completing the first draft as early as 1996. He initially presented it to Roach who had, up to that point, directed the first two &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films. Roach admits to have liked the script from the beginning and was very much willing to make the film even though he thought &quot;it needed more work.&quot; Universal initially declined to have relatively inexperienced Roach take on the project. The studio was skeptical of Roach&#x27;s ability to direct a &quot;less-cartoony, character-driven script&quot; compared to a comedy like &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Universal&#x27;s reluctance to give the project to Roach was also due to new interest from Steven Spielberg who wanted to direct and produce the film with Jim Carrey playing the role of Greg Focker. However, Spielberg and Carrey never took the project past the planning stages. The script was then returned to Roach who had by now taken on his next project of &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; but was still interested in making &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.

The drafts of the script were written by Herzfeld and, once De Niro and Stiller were confirmed as stars, John Hamburg was brought on board &quot;to help fit the script to their verbal styles.&quot; Due to changes in directorial and acting line-ups after the early drafts of the script were written, Hamburg kept adjusting and re-writing the script well after production had already begun.

===Casting===

Upon the suggestion of Universal Studios, Roach cast De Niro in the role of Jack Byrnes due to critical acclaim of his recent comedy work in films such as &quot;Analyze This&quot; and in the live-action/animated film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. His character is Pam&#x27;s father and a retired CIA operative who is overly protective of his family and has a hard time warming up to his daughters&#x27; love interests. The script was not written with De Niro in mind as Jack Byrnes; the first draft of the script was completed in 1996, three years before De Niro appeared in &quot;Analyze This&quot;. However, shortly after De Niro finished filming &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, Universal suggested to Roach that he should cast him for the role to which Roach agrees that he had &quot;no reservations whatsoever.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, De Niro stated that he was in active pursuit of comedic roles since &quot;Analyze This&quot;. Admitting that he had initial reservations about starring in the film, he said that he felt &quot;pushed into it&quot; due to insistence by Jane Rosenthal—De Niro&#x27;s partner in TriBeCa Productions who also acted as one of the producers. Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld and director Jay Roach both confirmed that, after committing to the project and reviewing the script, De Niro was actually the person who came up with the idea for the famous polygraph test scene. Asked about working with him given the serious nature of his previous roles, Ben Stiller said that &quot;it was a little bit intimidating working with De Niro&quot; but that he &quot;has a great sense of humor and I think that&#x27;s the biggest surprise about him.&quot;
Explaining how Ben Stiller came to be cast in the role of Greg, Roach states: &quot;I saw &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; as an anxiety dream, and in my view nobody plays that kind of material better than Ben.&quot; Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller&#x27;s creative and ad lib abilities stating that &quot;he has lots of great ideas and he&#x27;s very skilled at loose improvisation.&quot; His character is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film&#x27;s script was initially written with Jim Carrey in the role of Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.

The consideration to play the character of Pam Byrnes, Greg&#x27;s girlfriend who acts as a mediator between Greg and the Byrnes family, especially her father, Jack, was initially given to British actress Naomi Watts. She ultimately lost the role to Teri Polo because the filmmakers &quot;didn&#x27;t think [Watts] was sexy enough&quot;.

Other characters in the film were played by Blythe Danner (as Dina Byrnes, Jack&#x27;s wife and Pam&#x27;s mother), Owen Wilson (as Kevin Rawley, Pam&#x27;s ex-fiancée), Nicole DeHuff (as Debbie Byrnes, Pam&#x27;s sister), Jon Abrahams (as Denny Byrnes, the youngest child of Jack and Dina Byrnes), Thomas McCarthy (as Bob Banks, Debbie&#x27;s fiancé), and James Rebhorn (as Larry Banks, Bob Banks&#x27; father and a close friend of Jack&#x27;s). Phyllis George, who is a former Miss Texas and Miss America pageant winner and has appeared on numerous television programs as a guest and a host, made her acting debut as Linda Banks, Larry&#x27;s wife and Bob&#x27;s mother.

The role of Jinx the cat was played by two five-year-old Himalayan cats named Bailey and Misha (sometimes written as Meesha), though according to trainer Dawn Barkan, &quot;about 85%&quot; of Jinx&#x27;s scenes were done by Misha. The American Humane Association oversaw the filming of all scenes where the cats were used and ensured the animals&#x27; obedience and well-being by keeping two trainers and a veterinarian on set at all times.

==Rating==
Greg Glienna did not come up with the surname Focker; Greg&#x27;s character in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey came up with the idea for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, it was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.

==Release==

===Theatrical run===
&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; had its theatrical release in the United States and Canada on October 6, 2000. Distributed domestically by Universal Studios, it had an advertising budget of $33.9 million. It quickly proved to be a financial success, taking in $28.6 million during its opening weekend and averaging $10,950 per theater in a total of 2,614 theaters. It finished as the top-grossing film for the weekend of October 6–8, beating the second-placed &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; by a margin of over $9 million and bringing in more than four times the gross of &quot;Get Carter&quot;, the next highest-grossing film released that weekend. Its opening-weekend gross was the highest ever for any film released in the month of October, surpassing &quot;Antz&quot;, as well as marking the highest opening weekend gross for a film starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, beating &quot;Analyze This&quot; and &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;. The film&#x27;s October opening weekend record was later surpassed by &quot;Red Dragon&quot; in 2002. Its gross for the second week of release dropped by 26% down to $21.1 million, which still kept it at number one at the US box office beating &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; by a margin of over $8 million. By the end of the second week of release, it had already grossed over $58 million, surpassing its production budget of $55 million.
It spent its first four weeks of theatrical release as the highest-grossing film at the U.S. box office, making it the first film to do so since &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in 1999. It was displaced from number one during the weekend of November 3–5 by the newly released &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; while still managing to stay ahead of &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;, another new release that debuted at number three. It remained in the top 10 grossing films until its eleventh week.

The film started its international release, distributed by United International Pictures (UIP), on December 8, 2000 in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. In Germany, it was the number one film in its opening weekend with a four-day gross of $2.5 million from 356 screens. Its opening weekend screen average of $7,064 was the third-highest of 2000 in the country, behind &quot;&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it was released a week later on December 15, 2000. There, it managed to earn over $21 million during its run. In Australia, it was released on December 26, 2000, where it grossed over $11 million during the theatrical run. &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; grossed $166.2 million in the United States and Canada and a total of $330.4 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year both in the United States and Canada and worldwide.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on March 6, 2001. The DVD sales for it were successful, taking in over $200 million for 2001. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine listed it as having the highest video sales for all weeks from March 31 up to and including April 21, being the top-selling DVD for the weeks of March 24 and March 31, and being the top-rented video for the weeks of April 7 and April 14. Within its first week of release, it made $4.3 million in DVD rentals, beating the previous record held by &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;. Making $21.4 million, the film had the second-highest home video rentals at the time, after &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

The DVD release provides only the letterbox format of the film and is also 108 minutes in length. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1 with an accommodation for an enhanced 16:9 playback. English-language audio tracks available with the film are a 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS with the main noticeable difference being only a slightly louder bass on one of the tracks. A French-language audio track is also available only in 5.1 Dolby Digital Format. Additionally, English language subtitles are provided as well.

The single-disc &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; contains two audio commentaries, one a light-hearted and humorous discussion between Roach, Stiller, De Niro, and producer Jane Rosenthal and the other a more formal technical commentary on the film-making aspects by the director and editor Jon Poll. The director discusses issues that include working with the cast, utilizing the best camera angles for comedic effect, discussing scenes that were improvised and scenes that were scripted, and commenting on issues surrounding shooting on location. The editor speaks about putting together the best functioning comedy from material that was filmed and discusses some deleted scenes that were excluded from the DVD release. In addition, the DVD features a twelve-minute outtake section, three minutes of deleted scenes, and Universal&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight on Location&quot; featurette. &quot;Spotlight on Location&quot; is a standard 24-minute-long featurette about the making of the film which includes interviews with the cast members and contains behind-the-scenes footage. It also contains two games called &quot;Take The Lie Detector Test&quot; and &quot;The Forecaster Game&quot; as well as PC material such as wallpapers and screensavers. There are also trailers for &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; and &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot;. The region 2 edition of the DVD was released on October 22, 2001. A region 1 &quot;Bonus Edition&quot; was released on December 14, 2004, in both Widescreen (1.85:1) &amp; Full Screen (1.33:1) formats. Both versions contain three additional featurettes: &quot;Silly Cat Tricks&quot;, &quot;The Truth About Lying&quot; and a 12-minute-long &quot;Jay Roach: A Director&#x27;s Profile&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The original motion picture soundtrack for the film was released on September 26, 2000 on the DreamWorks Records record label. The soundtrack features 14 original compositions by Randy Newman as well as additional tracks by Bobby Womack, Lee Dorsey, and Dr. John and a hidden bonus track. Newman&#x27;s original song &quot;A Fool in Love&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song—Newman&#x27;s 14th Oscar nomination—at the 73rd Academy Awards but it ultimately lost to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; for &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;. For the same song, Newman also won the 16th Annual ASCAP Film &amp; Television Music Award in the Top Box Office Films category and was nominated at the 5th Golden Satellite Awards in the Original Song category. Dan Goldwasser, in his review of the soundtrack for Soundtrack.Net, gave credit to Newman and the soundtrack for doing &quot;an excellent job keeping the humor level high.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; received a generally positive response from film critics, being commended on the subtlety of its humor as well as being named as &quot;the funniest&quot; or &quot;one of the funniest&quot; films of the year by several critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Kenneth Turan, film critic for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, called it &quot;the funniest film of the year so far, possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;.&quot; Critic Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that the film &quot;does almost everything right with a story about everything going wrong&quot; and that it &quot;works up a major comic delirium on the theme of Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;, concluding that &quot;&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is the funniest movie of the year.&quot; CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton proclaimed &quot;&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is one of the best comedies of this—or any other—year&quot;, calling it &quot;wonderfully funny&quot; and expressing his hope that &quot;the Academy will also recognize this wonderful movie, something it rarely does when it comes to comedies.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s film critic Richard Schickel stated that it was &quot;divinely invented and perfectly orchestrated&quot;. He complimented the screenplay by calling the screenwriters Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg &quot;a couple of skilled tool-and-die makers&quot; as well as the cast because he believed that they &quot;understand that palpable reality will always trump frenzied fantasy when it comes to getting laughs.&quot; Schickel concluded his review by proclaiming &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; a &quot;superbly antic movie&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called the film &quot;flat-out hilarious&quot; and Neil Smith of BBC proclaimed that &quot;there&#x27;s not a weak scene in this super-funny picture&quot; while awarding it a rating of five stars out of five. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three stars out of four comparing it to Roach&#x27;s previous work on the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series and offering his opinion that &quot;[&quot;Meet the Parents&quot;] is funnier because it never tries too hard.&quot; Critic Christopher Null of AMC&#x27;s Filmcritic.com claimed that &quot;&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is one of the funniest comedies I&#x27;ve seen since &quot;Annie Hall&quot;&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the script &quot;unforced&quot; and concluded that it &quot;goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles.&quot;

However, Internet film critic James Berardinelli, in spite of awarding it two-and-a-half stars out of four, gave the film a somewhat scathing review. On his website, Berardinelli wrote that &quot;&quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is put together like a TV sit-com,&quot; that Roach &quot;strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent, interesting, or enjoyable (in most cases, it&#x27;s none of those three)&quot; and concluding that &quot;even with Stiller and De Niro, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; is an encounter that can be postponed until it&#x27;s available on video.&quot; Jeff Vice of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, another detractor of the film, proclaimed &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; &quot;only erratically funny&quot; and accused Roach of taking &quot;the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes.&quot; Critic Peter Bradshaw&#x27;s review of it in &quot;The Guardian&quot; concludes that &quot;It is somehow less than the sum of its parts. It strains to come to life, but never quite makes it.&quot; After it was released on home media, DVD reviewer and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book &quot;Doug Pratt&#x27;s DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!&quot; stated that &quot;perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical, but in the quieter venue of home video, it just seems sadistic, and as the humor evaporates, the holes in the plot become clearer.&quot;

==Influence==
The success of the film was initially responsible for a 2002 NBC reality television show entitled &quot;Meet My Folks&quot; in which a young woman&#x27;s love interest, vying for her family&#x27;s approval, is interrogated by the woman&#x27;s overprotective father with the help of a lie detector machine. In September 2002, NBC also aired a situation comedy entitled &quot;In-Laws&quot;. During the development of it, NBC called it &quot;a &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; project&quot; which prompted an investigation by Universal into whether NBC was infringing on Universal&#x27;s copyright. Universal did not pursue any action against NBC but neither show lasted more than one season. NBC and Universal would merge in 2004.

In 2004, &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; was released as a sequel to the film. Directed again by Jay Roach with a screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, it chronicles the events that take place when the Byrnes family meets Bernie and Roz Focker, Greg&#x27;s parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The producers intended for them to be the opposite of the Byrneses&#x27; conservative, upper class, WASPy demeanor; to that effect, producer Jane Rosenthal explains that &quot;Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were our dream team.&quot; The sequel proved to be another financial success grossing $280 million domestically and $516 million worldwide, outperforming &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; by a large margin and finishing as the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004.

In February 2007, Universal Studios announced that they would be making a second sequel in the franchise, titled &quot;Little Fockers&quot;. It was to be directed by Roach with the screenplay written by Larry Stuckey, Roach&#x27;s former assistant. The sequel brings back De Niro, Stiller, Polo, Danner, Hoffman, and Streisand. Roach was later replaced as director of the third film by Paul Weitz. &quot;Little Fockers&quot; was released in 2010 and grossed $148.4 million domestically and $310.7 million worldwide.

On July 18, 2005, a regularly scheduled American Airlines flight from Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport to San Juan, Puerto Rico, had to be diverted back to Fort Lauderdale shortly after take-off due to a bomb threat. The pilot turned the plane around approximately 40 minutes into the flight after a flight attendant found a crumpled napkin that read &quot;Bomb, bomb, bomb...meet the parents,&quot; a clear reference to the scene in which Greg repeatedly shouts the word &quot;bomb&quot; while being detained by airport security. The plane was met by a bomb squad of the local sheriff&#x27;s office as well as the FBI whose agents questioned its 176 passengers about the note.

<doc id="695026" wikidata="Q7049245" url="?curid=695026" title="Noncrossing partition">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the topic of noncrossing partitions has assumed some importance because of (among other things) its application to the theory of free probability. The number of noncrossing partitions of a set of &quot;n&quot; elements is the &quot;n&quot;th Catalan number. The number of noncrossing partitions of an &quot;n&quot;-element set with &quot;k&quot; blocks is found in the Narayana number triangle.

==Definition==

A partition of a set &quot;S&quot; is a set of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets of &quot;S&quot;, called &quot;parts&quot; or &quot;blocks&quot;, whose union is all of &quot;S&quot;. Consider a finite set that is linearly ordered, or (equivalently, for purposes of this definition) arranged in a cyclic order like the vertices of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon. No generality is lost by taking this set to be &quot;S&quot; = { 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; }. A noncrossing partition of &quot;S&quot; is a partition in which no two blocks &quot;cross&quot; each other, i.e., if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; belong to one block and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to another, they are not arranged in the order &quot;a x b y&quot;. If one draws an arch based at &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and another arch based at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, then the two arches cross each other if the order is &quot;a x b y&quot; but not if it is &quot;a x y b&quot; or &quot;a b x y&quot;. In the latter two orders the partition { { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; }, { &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; } } is noncrossing.

Equivalently, if we label the vertices of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon with the numbers 1 through &quot;n&quot;, the convex hulls of different blocks of the partition are disjoint from each other, i.e., they also do not &quot;cross&quot; each other.
The set of all non-crossing partitions of &quot;S&quot; is denoted formula_1. There is an obvious order isomorphism between formula_2 and formula_3 for two finite sets formula_4 with the same size. That is, formula_1 depends essentially only on the size of formula_6 and we denote by formula_7 the non-crossing partitions on &quot;any&quot; set of size &quot;n&quot;.

==Lattice structure==

Like the set of all partitions of the set { 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; }, the set of all noncrossing partitions is a lattice when partially ordered by saying that a finer partition is &quot;less than&quot; a coarser partition. However, although it is a subset of the lattice of all set partitions, it is &quot;not&quot; a sublattice, because the subset is not closed under the join operation in the larger lattice. In other words, the finest partition that is coarser than both of two noncrossing partitions is not always the finest &quot;noncrossing&quot; partition that is coarser than both of them.

Unlike the lattice of all partitions of the set, the lattice of all noncrossing partitions is self-dual, i.e., it is order-isomorphic to the lattice that results from inverting the partial order (&quot;turning it upside-down&quot;). This can be seen by observing that each noncrossing partition has a non-crossing complement. Indeed, every interval within this lattice is self-dual.

==Role in free probability theory==

The lattice of noncrossing partitions plays the same role in defining free cumulants in free probability theory that is played by the lattice of &quot;all&quot; partitions in defining joint cumulants in classical probability theory. To be more precise, let formula_8 be a non-commutative probability space (See free probability for terminology.), formula_9 a non-commutative random variable with free cumulants formula_10. Then

:formula_11

where formula_12 denotes the number of blocks of length formula_13 in the non-crossing partition formula_14.
That is, the moments of a non-commutative random variable can be expressed as a sum of free cumulants over the sum non-crossing partitions. This is the free analogue of the moment-cumulant formula in classical probability.

<text>In medical or research imaging, an incidental imaging finding (also called an incidentaloma) is an unanticipated finding which is not related to the original diagnostic inquiry. As with other types of incidental medical findings, they may represent a diagnostic, ethical, and philosophical dilemma because their significance is unclear. While some coincidental findings may lead to beneficial diagnoses, others may lead to overdiagnosis that results in unnecessary testing and treatment, sometimes called the &quot;cascade effect&quot;.

Incidental findings are common in imaging. For instance, around 1 in every 3 cardiac MRIs result in an incidental finding. Incidence is similar for chest CT scans (~30%).

As the use of medical imaging increases, the number of incidental findings also increases.

== Adrenal ==
Incidental adrenal masses on imaging are common (0.6 to 1.3% of all abdominal CT). Differential diagnosis include adenoma, myelolipoma, cyst, lipoma, pheochromocytoma, adrenal cancer, metastatic cancer, hyperplasia, and tuberculosis. Some of these lesions are easily identified by radiographic appearance; however, it is often adenoma vs. cancer/metastasis that is most difficult to distinguish. Thus, clinical guidelines have been developed to aid in diagnosis and decision-making. Although adrenal incidentalomas are common, they are not commonly cancerous - less than 1% of all adrenal incidentalomas are malignant.

The first considerations are size and radiographic appearance of the mass. Suspicious adrenal masses or those ≥4 cm are recommended for complete removal by adrenalectomy. Masses &lt;4 cm may also be recommended for removal if they are found to be hormonally active, but are otherwise recommended for observation. All adrenal masses should receive hormonal evaluation. Hormonal evaluation includes:
* 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test
* 24-hour urinary specimen for measurement of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines
* Blood plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity, &quot;if hypertension is present&quot;
On CT scan, benign adenomas typically are of low radiodensity (due to fat content). A radiodensity equal to or below 10 Hounsfield units (HU) is considered diagnostic of an adenoma. An adenoma also shows rapid radiocontrast washout (50% or more of the contrast medium washes out at 10 minutes). If the hormonal evaluation is negative and imaging suggests benign lesion, follow up may be considered. Imaging at 6, 12, and 24 months and repeat hormonal evaluation yearly for 4 years is often recommended, but there exists controversy about harm/benefit of such screening as there is a high subsequent false-positive rate (about 50:1) and overall low incidence of adrenal carcinoma.

== Brain ==
Autopsy series have suggested that pituitary incidentalomas may be quite common. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of the adult population may harbor such endocrinologically inert lesions. Most of these lesions, especially those which are small, will not grow. However, some form of long-term surveillance has been recommended based on the size and presentation of the lesion. With pituitary adenomas larger than 1 cm, a baseline pituitary hormonal function test should be done, including measurements of serum levels of TSH, prolactin, IGF-1 (as a test of growth hormone activity), adrenal function (i.e. 24 hour urine cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test), testosterone in men, and estradiol in amenorrheic women.

== Thyroid and parathyroid ==
Incidental thyroid masses may be found in 9% of patients undergoing bilateral carotid duplex ultrasonography.

Some experts recommend that nodules &gt; 1 cm (unless the TSH is suppressed) or those with ultrasonographic features of malignancy should be biopsied by fine needle aspiration. Computed tomography is inferior to ultrasound for evaluating thyroid nodules. Ultrasonographic markers of malignancy are:
* solid hypoechoic appearance
* irregular or blurred margins
* intranodular vascular spots or pattern
* microcalcifications

Incidental parathyroid masses may be found in 0.1% of patients undergoing bilateral carotid duplex ultrasonography.

The American College of Radiology recommends the following workup for thyroid nodules as incidental imaging findings on CT, MRI or PET-CT:
== Pulmonary ==
Studies of whole body screening computed tomography find abnormalities in the lungs of 14% of patients. Clinical practice guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians advise on the evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule.

== Kidney ==

Most renal cell carcinomas are now found incidentally. Tumors less than 3 cm in diameter less frequently have aggressive histology.

A CT scan is the first choice modality for workup of solid masses in the kidneys. Nevertheless, hemorrhagic cysts can resemble renal cell carcinomas on CT, but they are easily distinguished with Doppler ultrasonography (Doppler US). In renal cell carcinomas, Doppler US often shows vessels with high velocities caused by neovascularization and arteriovenous shunting. Some renal cell carcinomas are hypovascular and not distinguishable with Doppler US. Therefore, renal tumors without a Doppler signal, which are not obvious simple cysts on US and CT, should be further investigated with contrast-enhanced ultrasound, as this is more sensitive than both Doppler US and CT for the detection of hypovascular tumors.

== Spinal ==
The increasing use of MRI, often during diagnostic work-up for back or lower extremity pain, has led to a significant increase in the number of incidental findings that are most often clinically inconsequential. The most common include:
* vertebral hemangioma
* fibrolipoma (a lipoma with fibrous areas)
* Tarlov cyst

Sometimes normally asymptomatic findings can present with symptoms and these cases when identified cannot then be considered as incidentalomas.

== Criticism ==
The concept of the &quot;incidentaloma&quot; has been criticized, as such lesions do not have much in common other than the history of an incidental identification and the assumption that they are clinically inert. It has been proposed just to say that such lesions have been &quot;incidentally found.&quot; The underlying pathology shows no unifying histological concept.

<doc id="695046" wikidata="Q7269569" url="?curid=695046" title="Quaternionic representation">
<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory, a quaternionic representation is a representation on a complex vector space &quot;V&quot; with an invariant quaternionic structure, i.e., an antilinear equivariant map

:formula_1 
which satisfies

:formula_2

Together with the imaginary unit &quot;i&quot; and the antilinear map &quot;k&quot; := &quot;ij&quot;, &quot;j&quot; equips &quot;V&quot; with the structure of a quaternionic vector space (i.e., &quot;V&quot; becomes a module over the division algebra of quaternions). From this point of view, quaternionic representation of a group &quot;G&quot; is a group homomorphism &quot;φ&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → GL(&quot;V&quot;, H), the group of invertible quaternion-linear transformations of &quot;V&quot;. In particular, a quaternionic matrix representation of &quot;g&quot; assigns a square matrix of quaternions &quot;ρ&quot;(g) to each element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;ρ&quot;(e) is the identity matrix and

:formula_3

Quaternionic representations of associative and Lie algebras can be defined in a similar way.

==Properties and related concepts==

If &quot;V&quot; is a unitary representation and the quaternionic structure &quot;j&quot; is a unitary operator, then &quot;V&quot; admits an invariant complex symplectic form &quot;ω&quot;, and hence is a symplectic representation. This always holds if &quot;V&quot; is a representation of a compact group (e.g. a finite group) and in this case quaternionic representations are also known as symplectic representations. Such representations, amongst irreducible representations, can be picked out by the Frobenius-Schur indicator.

Quaternionic representations are similar to real representations in that they are isomorphic to their complex conjugate representation. Here a real representation is taken to be a complex representation with an invariant real structure, i.e., an antilinear equivariant map

:formula_1

which satisfies

:formula_5

A representation which is isomorphic to its complex conjugate, but which is not a real representation, is sometimes called a pseudoreal representation.

Real and pseudoreal representations of a group &quot;G&quot; can be understood by viewing them as representations of the real group algebra R[&quot;G&quot;]. Such a representation will be a direct sum of central simple R-algebras, which, by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem, must be matrix algebras over the real numbers or the quaternions. Thus a real or pseudoreal representation is a direct sum of irreducible real representations and irreducible quaternionic representations. It is real if no quaternionic representations occur in the decomposition.

== Examples ==

A common example involves the quaternionic representation of rotations in three dimensions. Each (proper) rotation is represented by a quaternion with unit norm. There is an obvious one-dimensional quaternionic vector space, namely the space H of quaternions themselves under left multiplication. By restricting this to the unit quaternions, we obtain a quaternionic representation of the spinor group Spin(3).

This representation &quot;ρ&quot;: Spin(3) → GL(1,H) also happens to be a unitary quaternionic representation because

:formula_6

for all &quot;g&quot; in Spin(3).

Another unitary example is the spin representation of Spin(5). An example of a non-unitary quaternionic representation would be the two dimensional irreducible representation of Spin(5,1).

More generally, the spin representations of Spin(&quot;d&quot;) are quaternionic when &quot;d&quot; equals 3 + 8&quot;k&quot;, 4 + 8&quot;k&quot;, and 5 + 8&quot;k&quot; dimensions, where &quot;k&quot; is an integer. In physics, one often encounters the spinors of Spin(&quot;d&quot;, 1). These representations have the same type of real or quaternionic structure as the spinors of Spin(&quot;d&quot; − 1).

Among the compact real forms of the simple Lie groups, irreducible quaternionic representations only exist for the Lie groups of type &quot;A&quot;4&quot;k&quot;+1, &quot;B&quot;4&quot;k&quot;+1, &quot;B&quot;4&quot;k&quot;+2, &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;D&quot;4&quot;k&quot;+2, and &quot;E&quot;7.

<doc id="695055" wikidata="Q815342" url="?curid=695055" title="Nessun dorma">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; English: &quot;Let no one sleep&quot;) is an aria from the final act of Italian composer Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot; (text by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni) and one of the best-known tenor arias in all opera. It is sung by Calaf, (the unknown prince), who falls in love at first sight with the beautiful but cold Princess Turandot. Any man who wishes to wed Turandot must first answer her three riddles; if he fails, he will be beheaded. In the aria, Calaf expresses his triumphant assurance that he will win the princess.

Although &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; had long been a staple of operatic recitals, Luciano Pavarotti popularised the piece beyond the opera world in the 1990s following his performance of it for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which captivated a global audience. Both Pavarotti and Plácido Domingo released singles of the aria, with Pavarotti&#x27;s reaching number 2 in the UK, and it appeared on the best-selling classical album of all time, &quot;The Three Tenors in Concert&quot;. The Three Tenors, which includes José Carreras, performed the aria at three subsequent FIFA World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. Since 1990, many crossover artists have performed and recorded it. The aria has been sung often in films and on television.

== Context and analysis ==
In the act before this aria, Calaf has correctly answered the three riddles put to all of Princess Turandot&#x27;s prospective suitors. Nonetheless, she recoils at the thought of marriage to him. Calaf offers her another chance by challenging her to guess his name by dawn. As he kneels before her, the &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; theme makes a first appearance, to his words, &quot;&quot; (My name you do not know!). She can execute him if she correctly guesses his name; but if she does not, she must marry him. The cruel and emotionally cold princess then decrees that none of her subjects shall sleep that night until his name is discovered. If they fail, all will be killed.

As the final act opens, it is now night. Calaf is alone in the moonlit palace gardens. In the distance, he hears Turandot&#x27;s heralds proclaiming her command. His aria begins with an echo of their cry and a reflection on Princess Turandot:

Just before the climactic end of the aria, a chorus of women is heard singing in the distance:

Calaf, now certain of victory, sings:

In typical performance style, the final &quot;Vincerò!&quot; features a sustained B, followed by the final note, an A sustained even longer—although Puccini&#x27;s score did not explicitly specify that either note be sustained. In the original score, the B is written as a sixteenth note while the A is written as a whole note. Both are high notes in the tenor range. 

In Alfano&#x27;s completion of act 3, the &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; theme makes a final triumphal appearance at the end of the opera. The theme also makes a concluding reappearance in Luciano Berio&#x27;s later completion (this having been an expressed intention of Puccini), but in a more subdued orchestration.

==Recordings==

&quot;Nessun dorma&quot;, sung by some of the most famous interpreters of Calaf, appears on the following compilation recordings (for full-length recordings of the opera, see &quot;Turandot&quot; discography):
* &quot;The Very Best of Beniamino Gigli&quot; (EMI Classics)
* &quot;The Very Best of Jussi Björling&quot; (EMI Classics)
* &quot;Richard Tucker in Recital&quot; (Columbia Masterworks/Myto)
* &quot;The Very Best of Franco Corelli&quot; (EMI Classics)
* &quot;Pavarotti Forever&quot; (Decca)
* &quot;The Essential Plácido Domingo&quot; (Deutsche Grammophon)

==Cultural references and adaptations==
===Luciano Pavarotti===
&quot;Nessun dorma&quot; achieved pop status after Luciano Pavarotti&#x27;s 1972 recording of it was used as the theme song of BBC television&#x27;s coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. It subsequently reached no. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Although Pavarotti rarely sang the role of Calaf on stage, &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; became his signature aria and a sporting anthem in its own right, especially for football. Pavarotti notably sang the aria during the first Three Tenors concert on the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final in Rome. For an encore, he performed the aria again, taking turns with José Carreras and Plácido Domingo. The image of three tenors in full formal dress singing in a World Cup concert captivated the global audience. The album of the concert achieved triple platinum record status in the United States alone and went on to outsell all other classical recordings worldwide. The number became a regular feature of subsequent Three Tenors concerts, and they performed it at three subsequent FIFA World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama.

Pavarotti gave a rendition of &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; at his final performance, the finale of the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, although it was later revealed that he had lip-synched the specially pre-recorded performance as it was too cold for him to sing live. His Decca recording of the aria was played at his funeral during the flypast by the Italian Air Force. In 2013, the track was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. The track was remixed in 2024 by Timmy Trumpet and Steve Aoki.

===Crossover and adapted versions===

&quot;Nessun dorma&quot; (often in adapted versions of the score) has been performed by many pop and crossover singers and instrumentalists.
* The 1989 song &quot;A Love So Beautiful&quot;, co-written by Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne, borrows the aria&#x27;s melody.
* In what the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences called &quot;the greatest last-second substitution act in Grammy history&quot;, Aretha Franklin sang a &quot;soul-infused&quot; version of the aria in place of Luciano Pavarotti when throat problems caused him to withdraw from the 1998 Grammy Awards show.
* The 2002 album &quot;Warriors of the World&quot; by the band Manowar features a version of the aria.
* In 2007, Chris Botti recorded a trumpet version of the aria for his album &quot;Italia&quot;.
* Anohni, lead singer of Antony and the Johnsons, recorded the aria with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta as part of an advertising campaign for the Italian coffee company Lavazza in 2009.
* Jeff Beck&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Emotion &amp; Commotion&quot; includes an instrumental version of the aria where the guitar takes the place of the human voice to an orchestral accompaniment.
* Nathan Pacheco sang the aria with the Tabernacle Choir during the Pioneer Day Concert at the LDS Conference Center on 19 July 2013.
* Jennifer Hudson sang the aria with the New York Philharmonic at the WE LOVE NYC: The Homecoming Concert special event in Central Park on 21 August 2021.

&quot;Nessun dorma&quot; has been used in many films, often appearing at a central moment in the film—sometimes with the aria&#x27;s moment of musical resolution aligned with the film&#x27;s narrative climax, giving symbolic meaning to the aria&#x27;s rich emotional impact.

Films in which the aria plays a significant role in the soundtrack include &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, &quot;New York Stories&quot;, &quot;The Sea Inside&quot;, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;, &quot;No Reservations,&quot; &quot;Goon,&quot; &quot;The Upside&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (with the scene set within a performance of &quot;Turandot&quot; itself). It was also used in a climactic scene of the first season of &quot;Daredevil&quot;. It was sung by Pavarotti himself as part of his fictional role in the film &quot;Yes, Giorgio&quot;. &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; is also the title of a short film by Ken Russell included in the 1987 film &quot;Aria&quot;.

&quot;Nessun dorma&quot; has also accompanied dramatic scenes in various television shows. For example, the piece is played at the conclusion of episode 4 of the Korean drama &quot;Vincenzo&quot; and during the first episode of the second season of &quot;Squid Game&quot;.

&quot;Nessun dorma&quot; is also the title of a football podcast (hosted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Lee Calvert and featuring sports writers past and present) that celebrates 1980s and 1990s football.

In July of 2024, shortly after the assassination attempt of President Trump, Nessun Dorma was played at the finale of the RNC inauguration. Given the similarities of the failed assassination attempt of the president in Sum of All fears, rumors and conspiracy theories have swirled from the Q / Anon community that President Trump was in fact sending a message to “deep state” actors. President Trump also would play the song at the end of various rallies. The meaning of the song is “I will win.”

<text>In mathematics, a complex representation is a representation of a group (or that of Lie algebra) on a complex vector space. Sometimes (for example in physics), the term complex representation is reserved for a representation on a complex vector space that is neither real nor pseudoreal (quaternionic). In other words, the group elements are expressed as complex matrices, and the complex conjugate of a complex representation is a different, non-equivalent representation. For compact groups, the Frobenius-Schur indicator can be used to tell whether a representation is real, complex, or pseudo-real. 

For example, the N-dimensional fundamental representation of SU(N) for N greater than two is a complex representation whose complex conjugate is often called the antifundamental representation.

<text>In mathematics differential geometry, an antifundamental representation of a Lie group is the complex conjugate of the fundamental representation, although the distinction between the fundamental and the antifundamental representation is a matter of convention. However, these two are often non-equivalent, because each of them is a complex representation.

<text>Alex Riel (13 September 1940 – 9 June 2024) was a Danish jazz and rock drummer. His first group, the Alex Riel/Palle Mikkelborg Quintet, won the Montreux Grand Prix Award at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1968. He was married to the writer Ane Riel.

==Biography==
Riel recorded with, among others, Booker Ervin, Kenny Drew, Kenny Werner, Bob Brookmeyer, Thomas Clausen, Bill Evans, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, Donald Byrd, Don Cherry, Thad Jones, and Ben Webster. He formed a jazz ensemble with bass player Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. Riel was also a founding member in 1968 of the Danish rock group The Savage Rose. His album &quot;The Riel Deal&quot; won a Danish Grammy for Best Danish Jazz Album in 1996.

In September 2010, Riel&#x27;s 70th birthday celebration at the Jazzhus Montmartre was broadcast live with the title &quot;Celebration of a Living Jazz Legend&quot; by the Danish national television station TV2.

==Personal life and death==
Riel married crime fiction author Ane Riel in 2002. They lived in Liseleje in North Zealand from 2005 until his death. He died at his home there on 9 June 2024, at the age of 83.

<doc id="695101" wikidata="Q7301169" url="?curid=695101" title="Real representation">
<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory a real representation is usually a representation on a real vector space &quot;U&quot;, but it can also mean a representation on a complex vector space &quot;V&quot; with an invariant real structure, i.e., an antilinear equivariant map

:formula_1
which satisfies
:formula_2
The two viewpoints are equivalent because if &quot;U&quot; is a real vector space acted on by a group &quot;G&quot; (say), then &quot;V&quot; = &quot;U&quot;⊗C is a representation on a complex vector space with an antilinear equivariant map given by complex conjugation. Conversely, if &quot;V&quot; is such a complex representation, then &quot;U&quot; can be recovered as the fixed point set of &quot;j&quot; (the eigenspace with eigenvalue 1).

In physics, where representations are often viewed concretely in terms of matrices, a real representation is one in which the entries of the matrices representing the group elements are real numbers. These matrices can act either on real or complex column vectors.

A real representation on a complex vector space is isomorphic to its complex conjugate representation, but the converse is not true: a representation which is isomorphic to its complex conjugate but which is not real is called a pseudoreal representation. An irreducible pseudoreal representation &quot;V&quot; is necessarily a quaternionic representation: it admits an invariant quaternionic structure, i.e., an antilinear equivariant map
:formula_1
which satisfies
:formula_4
A direct sum of real and quaternionic representations is neither real nor quaternionic in general.

A representation on a complex vector space can also be isomorphic to the dual representation of its complex conjugate. This happens precisely when the representation admits a nondegenerate invariant sesquilinear form, e.g. a hermitian form. Such representations are sometimes said to be complex or (pseudo-)hermitian.

==Frobenius-Schur indicator==
A criterion (for compact groups &quot;G&quot;) for reality of irreducible representations in terms of character theory is based on the Frobenius-Schur indicator defined by
:formula_5
where &quot;χ&quot; is the character of the representation and &quot;μ&quot; is the Haar measure with μ(&quot;G&quot;) = 1. For a finite group, this is given by
:formula_6
The indicator may take the values 1, 0 or −1. If the indicator is 1, then the representation is real. If the indicator is zero, the representation is complex (hermitian), and if the indicator is −1, the representation is quaternionic.

==Examples==

All representation of the symmetric groups are real (and in fact rational), since we can build a complete set of irreducible representations using Young tableaux.

All representations of the rotation groups on odd-dimensional spaces are real, since they all appear as subrepresentations of tensor products of copies of the fundamental representation, which is real.

Further examples of real representations are the spinor representations of the spin groups in 8&quot;k&quot;−1, 8&quot;k&quot;, and 8&quot;k&quot;+1 dimensions for &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, 3 ... This periodicity &quot;modulo&quot; 8 is known in mathematics not only in the theory of Clifford algebras, but also in algebraic topology, in KO-theory; see spin representation and Bott periodicity.

<doc id="695109" wikidata="Q2358243" url="?curid=695109" title="Chi Alpha">
<text>Chi Alpha |  (sometimes XA, χα, xa, or SfC - Students for Christ, officially known as Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship), is an international and interdenominational, coeducational Christian fellowship, social club, student society, and service organization founded in 1953 on the campus of Missouri State University (then known as Southwest Missouri State College) in Springfield, Missouri. Chi Alpha is sponsored by the Assemblies of God USA, a Pentecostal denomination established after separating from the historically African American Church of God in Christ in 1914 over race and administration.

Chi Alpha&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;to reconcile students to Jesus Christ, thereby transforming the university, the marketplace, and the world...&quot; It describes its core values or pillars as community, creativity, diversity, excellence, integrity, servant-leadership, and evangelism. Its self-described five-fold approach is prayer, worship, fellowship, discipleship, and mission. Its philanthropic and service organization affiliation is the Convoy of Hope. Through its campus ministries and fellowships, Chi Alpha operates a missionary internship program through the World Assemblies of God Fellowship, requiring doctrinal assent.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship&#x27;s campus ministries have fluctuated from 310 locations in 2010, to 350 in 2019, and 272 in 2024. The organization and its leadership have also been subjected to controversies involving the LGBT community, and sexual and psychological abuse with former members alleging &quot;cult-like&quot; personalities. In May 2023, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; and other outlets reported a registered sex offender was knowingly allowed to continued ministering to Chi Alpha students for more than 30 years. Since these reports, a website has been launched and dedicated against abuses within Chi Alpha and Assemblies of God.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Chi Alpha&quot; was inspired by the contemporary Assemblies of God youth movement, Christ&#x27;s Ambassadors (reflection a phrase in 2 Corinthians 5:20). The initials &quot;CA&quot; were changed to the Greek alphabet initials &quot;ΧΑ&quot; (and its Latin Script&#x27;s stylized equivalent of &quot;XA&quot;) in order to resemble the names of other college organizations, in particular Greek-letter fraternities and sororities. Outside of North America, it is also known as &quot;SfC - Students for Christ&quot; in Europe, and &quot;Conexión&quot; or &quot;UConexión&quot; in Latin America.

==History==
Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship originates from within Assemblies of God USA as a ministry to collegians in 1947 at the urging of J. Robert Ashcroft (father of John Ashcroft), consisting of a newsletter sent to college students to encourage them in their faith.

After Ashcroft&#x27;s newsletter publications, it soon became apparent that a newsletter by itself was inadequate, and so in 1953 Dr. J. Calvin Holsinger chartered the first Assemblies of God student group at Missouri State University (formerly Southwest Missouri State University) in Springfield, Missouri where the Assemblies of God headquarters is located; the Assemblies of God USA and its World Assemblies of God Fellowship were originally established in Arkansas upon separating from the historically African-American Church of God in Christ in 1914 in disagreement with episcopal governance and other controversies pertaining to race relations in the United States. The movement inspired and sponsored by Assemblies of God quickly spread to other campuses. For example, the first Chi Alpha to own property was the UC Berkeley chapter, which purchased a house next to campus in 1964.

Chi Alpha began its development internationally in the 1970s, establishing chapters in Europe under the name Students for Christ, and also into Latin America under various names.

In 1978, Dennis Gaylor became national director of Chi Alpha, and served until April 2013. He was then succeeded in leadership led by Scott Martin, up to 2023.

Annie Dillard wrote a widely reprinted essay—&quot;Singing with the Fundamentalists&quot;—about her experiences singing with a group of students from the Chi Alpha chapter at Western Washington University (a chapter which operated under the local name of Campus Christian Fellowship).

== Chapters ==

Chi Alpha within the United States has a large presence throughout the South and Midwest. Globally, its second-largest presence is in Europe, within some predominantly and historically Catholic and Eastern Orthodox countries of Western, Central, and Mediterranean Europe. At the beginning of the 21st century, there have been Chi Alpha ministries and fellowships on over 310 campuses throughout the United States as of 2010. As of December 2024, Chi Alpha had a presence at 270 campuses throughout the United States.

==Controversies==
Throughout the organization&#x27;s history, it has been involved in numerous controversies involving the LGBT community, sexual and psychological abuse, and religious abuse. For instance, Chi Alpha chapters at Georgetown University and the University of New Hampshire were highlighted in a 2003 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; entitled &quot;Of Bart and Homer, and the Many Ways of Faith&quot;—an article about their use of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as a Bible study tool. Additionally, in the 2014-2015 school year, Chi Alpha at CSU Stanislaus was removed from campus because they required that their leaders be Christians. The case gained national attention through conservative news channel Fox News. The chapter was eventually reinstated after a year-long dispute between Chi Alpha and the campus.

In 2019, Chi Alpha&#x27;s Winona State University fellowship was highlighted by former members for allegations of students following &quot;cult-like&quot; personalities. Its campus leader was alleged of favoritism and shaming student party-goers and drinkers; additional allegations included mishandling sexual abuse and psychological abuse. In 2020, a student from the University of Virginia alleged discrimination after coming out and being forced to step down. A year later, from 2021-2022, the fellowship was highlighted for leadership&#x27;s accusations of discrimination against the LGBT community, students having premarital sex, and students who consume alcohol.

=== Sexual abuse ===
In July 2022, a pastor working for Chi Alpha was arrested for &quot;continuous sexual abuse of a child,&quot; pleading innocence.

In May 2023, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; and other outlets reported the organization&#x27;s platforming of registered sexual offender, Daniel Savala, for more than 30 years. Following, according to a Dallas, Texas-based law firm, demands have been made to limit the activity of Chi Alpha on multiple college and university campuses. A website was also published, dedicated against abuses within Chi Alpha and the Assemblies of God. On 21 May 2023, board members and elders of a North Texas Assemblies of God church dismissed a pastor of the Texas A&amp;M Chi Alpha chapter and Mountain Valley Fellowship linked to the sex abuse scandal. On 25 May 2023, a Chi Alpha campus minister for Baylor University was arrested on child sex abuse charges. At the Baylor ministry, the campus chapter has opposed the university allowing an organization for LGBT students. The Baylor chapter was suspended during the sex abuse scandal.

In June 2023, Savala was arrested; according to &quot;The Christian Post&quot;, the Assemblies of God USA noted that Savala was never on staff with Chi Alpha and took steps to sever ties as they learned of his sex offender status. Whistleblowers reportedly disputed the claims. Following Savala&#x27;s arrest in June, an Alaskan minister linked to Chi Alpha was charged with sexual abuse.

By August of 2023, three Assemblies of God pastors from Texas and Louisiana had called for the resignation of the denomination’s leaders over the Savala scandal. A pastor from Orange, Texas criticized his denomination&#x27;s general superintendent, Doug E. Clay, and alleging minimization of the abuse Savala has been accused of. Clay described the scandal as a series of &quot;hiccups,&quot; while Orange, Texas-pastor Armstrong responded, &quot;Hundreds of victims of sexual abuse is not a spot on a spectrum.&quot;

In October 2023, it was revealed from a 1989 yearbook for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, that Savala was mentioned as a Chi Alpha staff member alongside campus minister Eric Treuil. Treuil reestablished the local Chi Alpha chapter for the university in 1987, and since 1994, has led the Cajuns 4 Christ athletic outreach program.

Prior, in 2012, former Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajun football players were arrested for sexual assault allegations. Following, some members of the Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns sought baptism through Chi Alpha and Treuil responded:

In November 2023, national director Scott Martin resigned and the Assemblies of God withheld comment from &quot;The Christian Post&quot;, referencing its statement on the Savala scandal.

In January 2024, additional allegations were presented from an unnamed minor in Texas in a lawsuit set by their father against the Assemblies of God. By March 2024, a church disaffiliated from Assemblies of God USA over the Chi Alpha sex abuse scandal. By May 2024, three men linked with Chi Alpha&#x27;s Texas A&amp;M chapter were arrested for indecency with a child.

In August 2024, the suspended Texas A&amp;M chapter was highlighted for recruiting during its suspension.

<text>HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was a &quot;London&quot;-class pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was one of two ships of the &quot;London&quot;- or &quot;Queen&quot; sub-class. Shortly after completion the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and then to the Atlantic in 1909 and Home Fleets three year later. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; often served as a flagship during her career.

The ship was assigned to the Channel Fleet after the beginning of the First World War in August 1914 and ferried Royal Marines to Belgium that same month. In early 1915, she was ordered to the Mediterranean to support Allied forces in the Dardanelles Campaign, but &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; only remained there briefly before being ordered to the Adriatic to reinforce Italian forces there in case of an attack by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The ship was ordered home in early 1917 and reduced to reserve upon her arrival. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; served as an accommodation ship until she was listed for sale in late 1919. The ship was sold for scrap in mid-1920 and broken up thereafter.

==Design and description==
The Director of Naval Construction, Sir William White, proposed a further pair of &quot;London&quot;s to round out a tactical squadron of eight ships for the 1900 Naval Programme. After some hesitation, the Admiralty agreed, despite the ongoing construction of the smaller and faster . A controversy engendered by Rear-Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet, about the retention of obsolete ironclads in the fleet in mid-1900 was largely responsible for the decision. The two ships were virtually identical to the preceding &quot;London&quot; sub-class of the &quot;Formidable&quot;s and are generally considered part of the &quot;Formidable&quot; or &quot;London&quot; class, but the difference in the distribution of their 12-pounder guns, their lower displacement, and their later construction than the &quot;Duncan&quot;s lead some authors to view them as constituting a &quot;Queen&quot; class separate from the &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;London&quot; classes.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of at deep load. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, some lighter than the last of the &quot;London&quot;s, . At deep load the ship had a metacentric height of . &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had a complement of 747 officers and ratings when she was completed in 1904.

The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller, using steam provided by 20 Belleville boilers. She was the last British battleship built with Belleville boilers as they had proven problematic and uneconomical in earlier ships. The engines were designed to produce a total of give her a speed of and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; slightly exceeded this on her sea trials on 8 February 1908, reaching . She carried enough coal to steam at a speed of .

===Armament and armour===
The &quot;London&quot;-class ships&#x27; main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) BL Mk IX guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Each gun was provided with 80 rounds. The guns had a maximum range of with their shells. Their secondary armament consisted of a dozen BL Mk VII guns on single mounts positioned in casemates amidships, six on each broadside. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and the remainder on the upper deck; the main-deck guns were difficult to work in heavy weather. 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ship. They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells. Fourteen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Four of these were on the main deck, one pair at each end of the ship and the remaining ten on the upper deck. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; also carried six 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, two in each fighting top and one on each turret roof. The ship was fitted with four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two on each broadside abreast the barbettes.

The &quot;London&quot;s&#x27; armour scheme was similar to that of the &quot;Canopus&quot;es, although, unlike in the earlier ships, the waterline armour belt of Krupp cemented armour extended the length of the ship. The thick portion was long and ran from just aft of the forward barbette to a point abreast the aft barbette, and had a total height of of which was above water and the remainder below water at normal load. The thickness of the forward belt armour reduced in steps to the stem and there was a belt running from the aft barbette to the stern. A bulkhead extended obliquely from the aft end of the main belt to the rear face of the aft barbette.

The gun turrets were protected by Krupp armour, on their faces and 10 inches on their backs, with roofs 2 to 3 inches thick. The Krupp armour of the barbettes was 12 inches thick above the main deck, but 10 inches on the face and sides and 6 inches on the rear below it. The casemates were protected by 6 inches of Krupp armour. The thicknesses of the mild steel decks ranged from . The walls of the forward conning tower were 10 inches of Harvey armour with a roof and the aft conning tower had three inches of nickel steel.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, named after the title conferred upon the eldest son of the monarch, was the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 20 March 1901, the first keel plate laid by Lady Wharton, wife of Rear-Admiral Sir William Wharton, Hydrographer to the Admiralty. She was launched by the Princess of Wales (later Queen Mary) on 25 March 1902, in the presence of the Prince of Wales (later King George V), for whom the ship was named. Upon completion in March 1904, HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; immediately went into reserve at Chatham Dockyard. The ship commissioned there on 18 May for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, she collided with the merchant steamer off Oran, French North Africa, on 29 July 1905, &quot;Enidwen&quot;″s anchor being pushed through her main deck plating. On 16 April 1906, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had an engine-room explosion in which three men were killed and four injured. On 28 May, she ended her first Mediterranean tour by paying off for a refit at Portsmouth Dockyard that lasted from June to November. On 8 September, the ship again commissioned for Mediterranean Fleet service. She became the flagship of the second-in-command of the fleet in August 1907, and underwent another refit at Malta in 1908.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; transferred to the Atlantic Fleet as flagship of the fleet&#x27;s commander in February 1909 and was damaged by an explosion in one of her stokeholds on 2 July. In December 1910, Rear-Admiral John Jellicoe, later commander of the Grand Fleet and First Sea Lord, hoisted his flag in &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The ship underwent a refit at Gibraltar in February–May 1911 before she was transferred to the Home Fleets on 13 May 1912. Initially &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; became flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron of the First Fleet, but then reverted to a private ship in the squadron on 13 May. The ship later became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Second Fleet, at Portsmouth. and part of the 5th Battle Squadron. By 18 February 1913, she was serving as the flagship for the second-in-command of the 5th Battle Squadron. On 2 June 1913, she was accidentally rammed by the submarine HMS &quot;C32&quot; while participating in exercises, but suffered no damage. By 18 May 1914, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had relieved her sister ship, , as flagship of the 5th Battle Squadron.

===World War I===
When World War I broke out in August 1914, the squadron was assigned to the newly reconstituted Channel Fleet on 7 November and based at Portland, from which it patrolled the English Channel. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was now the flagship of Rear-Admiral Bernard Currey and the first task of the squadron was to protect the transfer of the British Expeditionary Force over the English Channel to France. They patrolled the eastern end of the Channel while the 7th and 8th Battle Squadrons covered the cruiser squadron at the western entrance. The Germans made no significant effort to interfere with the traffic in the Channel and the 5th BS was allowed to return to Portland after the bulk of the BEF was across on 23 August. Several days later, the squadron ferried the Portsmouth Marine Battalion to Ostend, Belgium. On 14 November, the squadron transferred to Sheerness to guard against a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom, but it transferred back to Portland on 30 December 1914.

On 19 March 1915, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was ordered to the Dardanelles to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 20 March 1915 and was assigned to the British 5th Squadron of the Allied Fleet off the Dardanelles, where she arrived on 29 March. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; supported the landings of the 3rd Brigade, Australian Army, at Gaba Tepe and Anzac Cove on 25 April. Her time at the Dardanelles was destined to be short as the Anglo-French-Italian Naval Convention of 10 May required that the British furnish a squadron of four battleships to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. He therefore kept his most modern battleships, plus the British ones, at Taranto to blockade the Austro-Hungarians in the Adriatic Sea.

On 22 May, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, along with the battleships &quot;Implacable&quot;, &quot;London&quot;, and &quot;Queen&quot;, was transferred to the Adriatic to form the 2nd Detached Squadron and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; arrived at her new base on 27 May. The ship became the flagship of the squadron in March 1916. She ended her flagship duties in June 1916, when she went to Gibraltar for a refit and then returned to the Adriatic.

In February 1917, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was ordered to return to the United Kingdom. On her voyage home, she called at Gibraltar from 28 February 1917 to 10 March 1917 and arrived at Devonport Dockyard later in March. She was placed in reserve on arrival and used as an accommodation ship. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was placed on the disposal list on 10 November 1919, and was sold for scrap to Thos. W. Ward on 12 April 1920. The ship arrived at Milford Haven, Wales, to be broken up in June 1920.

<text>The Michael Coren Show (originally Michael Coren Live, until it ceased being a live-to-air broadcast) is an hour-long Canadian public affairs panel show hosted by Michael Coren which dealt with , social issues as well as arts and culture. It aired weeknights on the Crossroads Television System, a multi-faith television network with affiliates in Ontario and Alberta. The showed aired on CTS from 1999 until June 30, 2011, when Coren left CTS to join the Sun News Network to host &quot;The Arena with Michael Coren&quot;.

The show typically featured Coren and up to four guests. Weekly regulars on the panel included outspoken freelance writer David Menzies, liberal Muslim Tarek Fatah, journalist and broadcaster Marianne Meed Ward, new media personality Andrew Lawton, CUPE leader Sid Ryan, legal agent and socialist Harry Kopyto and high-profile guests, including prominent politicians, journalists and cultural figures such as Mohamed Elmasry, David Orchard, Marva Wisdom, and Bert Archer. Topics of discussion regularly included provincial and federal and international politics, social issues, religion and healthcare as well as general news and cultural subjects. The show was known for debate on controversial issues (for example, Coren has hosted numerous shows on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Islamic extremism versus Islam, with guests who have strong stances on both sides of these issues).

Programs on the Middle East have proven contentious in the past with leaders of both the B&#x27;nai Brith and Canadian Islamic Congress facing recriminations for controversial remarks. In the aftermath of program aired on October 19, 2004, Adam Aptowitzer, Ontario chairman of the B&#x27;nai Brith Institute for International Affairs, was forced to resign his position after arguing that Israel had used terror against Palestinians legitimately stating that &quot;When Israel uses terror ... to destroy a home and convince people ... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an acceptable use to terrify somebody.&quot; On the same broadcast Elmasry, president of the Canadian Islamic Congress, asserted that all adult Israelis are legitimate targets of attack as a consequence of their service in the Israel Defense Forces. Elmasry apologized for his comments and offered to resign—his resignation was rejected by the CIC.

&quot;The Michael Coren Show&quot; was also the name of Coren&#x27;s Sunday evening radio program on CFRB and has also been the name of past radio shows he has hosted on various radio stations.

<text>Vazul, or Vászoly, (before 997–1031 or 1032) was a member of the House of Árpád, a grandson of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The only other certain information about his life is that he was kept in captivity and blinded in the fortress of Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) in the last years of the reign of his cousin, King Stephen I of Hungary. Modern historians, including György Györffy, do not exclude that he had earlier been Duke of Nyitra. He is the forefather of nearly all Kings of Hungary who reigned after 1046.

==Life==
Vazul was a son of Michael, who was the younger son of Grand Prince Taksony. His mother&#x27;s name is unknown. According to György Györffy, it is &quot;probable&quot; that she was a Bulgarian princess, a relative of Samuel of Bulgaria. Györffy also writes that Vazul was still a child around 997. His name derived from the Greek Basileios which implies that he was baptized according to Byzantine rite.

Györffy says that Vazul &quot;apparently&quot; held the &quot;Nyitra ducate&quot;, because chronicles do not make mention of other settlements in connection with his life. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, King Stephen imprisoned Vazul and held him in captivity in the fortress of Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) in order to urge him to &quot;amend his youthful frivolity and folly&quot;. In contrast with Györffy, his Slovak colleague, Ján Steinhübel has no doubt that Vazul was a Duke of Nyitra, who succeeded his brother, Ladislas the Bald before 1030. Steinhübel adds that Vazul, similarly to his brother, accepted the suzerainty of King Mieszko II of Poland; he was imprisoned at his former seat when King Stephen I of Hungary occupied his duchy in 1031. The theory that the &quot;Duchy of Nyitra&quot; was under Polish suzerainty in the first decades of the 11th century, which is based on the &quot;Polish-Hungarian Chronicle&quot;, is flatly refused by Györffy.

Emeric, the only son of King Stephen who survived infancy died in a hunting accident in 1031. Although Vazul who was Stephen&#x27;s closest agnatic relative had the strongest claim to succeed him on the throne, the king disregarded him and nominated his own sister&#x27;s son, Peter Orseolo as his heir. According to the nearly contemporaneous &quot;Annals of Altaich&quot;, Vazul bitterly resented his omission, but he was blinded on King Stephen&#x27;s order. According to the contrasting reports of later Hungarian chronicles, written under kings descending from Vazul&#x27;s line, Stephen initially was planning to nominate Vazul as his heir, but Vazul&#x27;s enemies, including Stephen&#x27;s queen, Gisela hatched a plot to hinder the king&#x27;s plans. They sent an &quot;evil man&quot; to Nyitra who &quot;put out Vazul&#x27;s eyes and filled the cavities of his ears with lead&quot; before the king&#x27;s envoys arrived.

==Family==
Information on Vazul&#x27;s family is contradictory. Later Hungarian chronicles tended to hide that the kings reigning after 1046 descended from a prince who was disinherited and sentenced by the holy first king of Hungary. Accordingly, many of the chronicles write that Vazul&#x27;s brother, Ladislas the Bald, was the Hungarian monarchs&#x27; forefather. However, a report recorded in the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; has preserved the memory of Vazul&#x27;s paternity of three sons named Andrew, Béla, and Levente. Likewise the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; writes that Vazul&#x27;s wife was a member of the Tátony clan, but his marriage lacked legitimacy. His three sons were expelled from Hungary after Vazul&#x27;s death in 1031 or 1032.

Györffy and Gerics claimed that the name &quot;Tatun&quot;, wife of Vazul, is the misspelling of &quot;Khatun&quot;, which was a royal title among people of Turkish origins from Manchuria to Bulgaria. Its meaning was &quot;the first wife of the khagan&quot;. According to Györffy, a girl from the kindred Tatun was the daughter of Tatun, the wife of Kean (mentioned in the Hungarian chronicles), i. e. the tsar of Bulgaria, whose family fled to Hungary when Basil II, Byzantine Emperor put an end to the existence of Bulgarian state (996-1004, 1014–1018). Gerics claimed that Vazul and Tatun were still pagan at the time of their marriage, and that is the reason that the Hungarian chronicles declared that Andrew, Béla, and Levente, the sons of Duke Vazul, were not born of a true marriage-bed. Gerics also claimed that Tatun might have participated in the riot of Koppány, and subsequently lost their noble status. For this reason the Hungarian chronicles declared that the sons of Vazul derived their nobility from their father, not their mother.

The following family tree presents Vazul&#x27;s ancestry and his offspring.





&quot;*Whether Menumorut is an actual or an invented person is debated by modern scholars.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;**A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;***Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;****Kristó writes that she may have been a member of the Rurik dynasty from Kievan Rus&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Trini Kwan is a fictional character from the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, first appearing in the original series as the Yellow Ranger (Sabertooth Tiger ). She was portrayed by Vietnamese-American actress Thuy Trang.

Trini was originally portrayed by actress Audri Dubois in the unaired pilot episode, but when the show was picked up for television, for which a new pilot was filmed, she was played by Trang, around whom the character was rewritten. A reimagined version of Trini appears in the 2017 reboot film, played by Mexican-American singer Becky G.

==Character biography==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;===
====Season 1====
In &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, Trini makes her first appearance performing a Kata in the first episode. When Rita Repulsa escapes and begins wreaking havoc on Earth, Trini, along with her close friends Jason Lee Scott, Zack Taylor, Billy Cranston, and Kimberly Hart, is one of the five teens chosen by Zordon to receive great power, drawn from the spirits of the prehistoric animals. These powers allow them to transform into a fighting force known as the Power Rangers. Trini is chosen for her compassion, quick wits, and martial arts talent, and becomes the Yellow Power Ranger, given the Sabertooth Tiger Power Coin and the Sabertooth Tiger Dinozord.

Trini is well-versed in kung fu. She would later become proficient in the art of Praying Mantis Kung Fu, mirroring Thuy Trang&#x27;s real-life training in the martial art. Trini&#x27;s signature fighting style included lightning-fast maneuvers and powerful high kicks. She attempts to neutralize foes with the least amount of force. Trini is one of the intellectuals of the team, often having to translate Billy&#x27;s techno talk for the other Rangers.

Generally soft-spoken and polite, Trini is a calm and warm person. She is an environmentalist. She is prepared to both push herself and put herself in danger for those she loves.

====Season 2====
In Season 2, with the arrival of the new nemesis Lord Zedd, the Rangers are given the new Thunderzords to battle Zedd&#x27;s monsters, which are significantly more powerful than those created by Rita. Trini is given the new Griffin Thunderzord.

Also, during the earlier part of the season, Trini is courted by a new student in school named Richie. Initially, they both are too nervous about speaking to each other, but eventually, Richie gathers the courage to ask Trini on a study date.

Trini, along with Jason and Zack, are selected as delegates to the World Peace Conference in Switzerland. Zordon selects Aisha as her successor.

====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;====
The 2023 Netflix special, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, set 30 years after Zordon originally recruited the Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers, reveals that Trini resumed her Power Ranger duties after returning from the Peace Conference and has a teenage daughter called Minh (Charlie Kersh).

While attempting to bring Zordon back to life, Billy accidentally restores the evil spirit of Rita Repulsa, which takes over the body of Alpha 8 and becomes Robo-Rita. In the ensuing battle, Rita fires an energy blast at Billy which is intercepted by Trini, killing her in the process. Zack becomes Minh&#x27;s legal guardian, while Minh begins training in the hope of destroying Rita and avenging her mother.

One year later, Robo-Rita reappears and captures Tommy, Jason, and Kimberly. She plans to drain their energy to power a time machine that will allow her to contact her past self and alter the timeline in her favor. While Zack and Billy lead the remaining Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers to defend Angel Grove and thwart Rita&#x27;s plan, Minh steals Trini&#x27;s morpher to join the fight but finds herself unable to use it. Echoing Zordon, Zack counsels her to use her skills to defend life, rather than for revenge.

During the final battle with Robo-Rita, Minh intercepts another one of her attacks to save Billy. This action bonds Minh to the Sabre-Toothed Tiger Power Coin, which shows her mother&#x27;s memories, saves her and allows her to morph into the new Yellow Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Ranger. Zack uses the Power Axe&#x27;s cannon mode to destroy Rita once and for all, saying Trini&#x27;s name before delivering the final blow. Later, Aisha Campbell - who took over as the Yellow Ranger when Trini left for the Peace Conference - congratulates Minh on inheriting the legacy that she once held herself.

&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Thuy Trang, as well as Tommy Oliver&#x27;s actor Jason David Frank, who died in November 2022.

===2017 film===

In the 2017 film, which is a modern-day reboot of the original &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series, Trini is portrayed by Mexican-American singer Becky G. She is depicted more closely to what Trini was in the television series pilot when played by Audri Dubois, i.e. as a teen of Mexican origin rather than of Asian origin. The film also portrays Trini as being queer, and as such, she has gained fame for being the first LGBTQ superhero in the film. Trini reveals that Angel Grove is her third school in three years as her family often moved around, but she tends to avoid interaction with others, to the extent that she has been in Kimberly&#x27;s biology class for a year and Kimberly never noticed her. Trini&#x27;s issues are made worse by her family&#x27;s relative normality, as her parents are essentially incapable of acknowledging or accepting her sexuality. However, as she trains with the team, having met them while practicing martial arts in the mine where Billy found the Power Coins, despite them meeting Zordon and Alpha before Zack even asks for her name, she comes to form a closer bond with the group. When Rita attacks Trini on her own and &quot;offers&quot; to spare her if Trini will tell her the location of the Zeo Crystal, Trini warns the rest of the team. After they manage to morph into their ranger suits, Trini joins the other Rangers in attacking Goldar in their zords before they form the Megazord for the first time.

===Comics===
====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink&quot;====
Kimberly is the main character in this comic book mini-series published by Boom! Studios. The series is a modern-day remake but also serves as a continuation from Kimberly&#x27;s exit in the third season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Kimberly needs to rescue a French town under siege from Goldar. She seeks help from Zordon who uses the Sword of Light to activate the latent pink energy within her. Kimberly then teleports to Zack and Trini in South America for their help. Zordon uses the Sword of Light to share Kimberly&#x27;s power with them. Trini once again becomes the Yellow Ranger. It is also revealed that Trini and Zack are in a relationship.

==Development==
The name Trini was originally used for the character &quot;Trini Crystal&quot; in a 1986 television pilot for an American adaptation of the Super Sentai series &quot;Choudenshi Bioman&quot;. Described as &quot;an intellectual and struggling artist&quot;, the character was portrayed by American actress Tricia Leigh Fisher. Though &quot;Bioman&quot; was not picked up for a series, the character names of Trini, Zack, Kimberly, and Billy would later be used for &quot;Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers&quot;.

Early in Season 2, actress Thuy Trang injured her leg while performing a stunt on the show (the cast usually performed their own stunts). In particular, in the episode &quot;The Beetle Invasion&quot; she is notably seen sitting on a bench wearing a knee brace while the other Rangers played the game. Hence the character was unable to participate in most fight scenes and was often absent from other scenes that did not have something to sit on, for the rest of the actress&#x27;s time on the series.

When Thuy Trang, Austin St. John (Jason), and Walter Jones (Zack) left the show (over contract disputes), their characters stopped making new on-screen or face-to-camera shots, simply being shown in their Ranger uniforms, using archive footage, or with doubles who were not directly facing the cameras, before they were written off in the two-part &quot;Power Transfer&quot; episode in which their characters were chosen to attend the World Peace Conference. Trini urged Zordon that they could not leave during such a crisis, but Zordon advised the transfer as the best decision to make. The Sword of Light transferred Trini&#x27;s powers to Aisha Campbell. Though Jason later returned in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the tenth anniversary special &quot;Forever Red,&quot; it was never stated what became of Zack or Trini after the peace conference.

Unlike Kimberly, Trini did not wear a skirt with her Ranger suit and appears with male anatomical contours in most morphed sequences. This is because the action scenes from the first season of &quot;Mighty Morphin&quot; used footage from the 1992 &quot;Super Sentai&quot; television series &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot;. Her counterpart on &quot;Zyuranger&quot;, Boi, the Tiger Ranger (portrayed by ), was male. However, a female version of the Tiger Ranger costume was made with a skirt for the 2011 &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series &quot;Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger&quot;, which first appears on the show in Episode 11 due to Luka Millfy/Gokai Yellow being female.

==Reception==
The choice of color for the Black Ranger (Zack Taylor) and Yellow Ranger (Trini Kwan) has been a source of criticism, due to the belief these colors are representations of their racial backgrounds. There are many parodies illustrating the perceived inherent racism of the show. According to the producers, this was not noticed until the tenth episode of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;.

Asian-American musician Awkwafina&#x27;s debut album is named &quot;Yellow Ranger&quot; in homage to Trini.

<text>In economics and accounting, the cost of capital is the cost of a company&#x27;s funds (both debt and equity), or from an investor&#x27;s point of view is &quot;the required rate of return on a portfolio company&#x27;s existing securities&quot;. It is used to evaluate new projects of a company. It is the minimum return that investors expect for providing capital to the company, thus setting a benchmark that a new project has to meet.

==Basic concept==
For an investment to be worthwhile, the expected return on capital has to be higher than the cost of capital. Given a number of competing investment opportunities, investors are expected to put their capital to work in order to maximize the return. In other words, the cost of capital is the rate of return that capital could be expected to earn in the best alternative investment of equivalent risk; this is the opportunity cost of capital. If a project is of similar risk to a company&#x27;s average business activities it is reasonable to use the company&#x27;s average cost of capital as a basis for the evaluation or cost of capital is a firm&#x27;s cost of raising funds. However, for projects outside the core business of the company, the current cost of capital may not be the appropriate yardstick to use, as the risks of the businesses are not the same.

A company&#x27;s securities typically include both debt and equity; one must therefore calculate both the cost of debt and the cost of equity to determine a company&#x27;s cost of capital. Importantly, both cost of debt and equity must be forward looking, and reflect the expectations of risk and return in the future. This means, for instance, that the past cost of debt is not a good indicator of the actual forward looking cost of debt.

Once cost of debt and cost of equity have been determined, their blend, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), can be calculated. This WACC can then be used as a discount rate for a project&#x27;s projected free cash flows to the firm.

== Example ==
Suppose a company considers taking on a project or investment of some kind, for example installing a new piece of machinery in one of their factories. Installing this new machinery will cost money; paying the technicians to install the machinery, transporting the machinery, buying the parts and so on. This new machinery is also expected to generate new profit (otherwise, assuming the company is interested in profit, the company would not consider the project in the first place). So the company will finance the project with two broad categories of finance: issuing debt, by taking out a loan or other debt instrument such as a bond; and issuing equity, usually by issuing new shares.

The new debt-holders and shareholders who have decided to invest in the company to fund this new machinery will expect a return on their investment: debt-holders require interest payments and shareholders require dividends (or capital gain from selling the shares after their value increases). The idea is that some of the profit generated by this new project will be used to repay the debt and satisfy the new shareholders.

Suppose that one of the sources of finance for this new project was a bond (issued at par value) of with an interest rate of 5%. This means that the company would issue the bond to some willing investor, who would give the to the company which it could then use, for a specified period of time (the term of the bond) to finance its project. The company would also make regular payments to the investor of 5% of the original amount they invested ($10,000), at a yearly or monthly rate depending on the specifics of the bond (these are called coupon payments). At the end of the lifetime of the bond (when the bond matures), the company would return the they borrowed.

Suppose the bond had a lifetime of ten years and coupon payments were made yearly. This means that the investor would receive every year for ten years, and then finally their back at the end of the ten years. From the investor&#x27;s point of view, their investment of would be regained at the end of the ten years (entailing zero gain or loss), but they would have &quot;also&quot; gained from the coupon payments; the per year for ten years would amount to a net gain of to the investor. This is the amount that compensates the investor for taking the risk of investing in the company (since, if it happens that the project fails completely and the company goes bankrupt, there is a chance that the investor does not get their money back).

This net gain of was paid by the company to the investor as a reward for investing their money in the company. In essence, this is how much the company paid to borrow . It was the &quot;cost&quot; of raising of new capital. So to raise the company had to pay out of their profits; thus we say that the &quot;cost of debt&quot; in this case was 50%.

Theoretically, if the company were to raise further capital by issuing more of the same bonds, the new investors would also expect a 50% return on their investment (although in practice the required return varies depending on the size of the investment, the lifetime of the loan, the risk of the project and so on).

The cost of equity follows the same principle: the investors expect a certain return from their investment, and the company must pay this amount in order for the investors to be willing to invest in the company. (Although the cost of equity is calculated differently since dividends, unlike interest payments, are not necessarily a fixed payment or a legal requirement.)

==Cost of debt==
When companies borrow funds from outside lenders, the interest paid on these funds is called the cost of debt. The cost of debt is computed by taking the rate on a risk-free bond whose duration matches the term structure of the corporate debt, then adding a default premium. This default premium will rise as the amount of debt increases (since, all other things being equal, the risk rises as the cost of debt rises). Since in most cases debt expense is a deductible expense, the cost of debt is computed on an after-tax basis to make it comparable with the cost of equity (earnings are taxed as well). Thus, for profitable firms, debt is discounted by the tax rate. The formula can be written as
:formula_1,
where formula_2 is the corporate tax rate and formula_3 is the risk free rate.

==Cost of equity==

The cost of equity is &quot;inferred&quot; by comparing the investment to other investments (comparable) with similar risk profiles. It is commonly computed using the capital asset pricing model formula:

:Cost of equity = Risk free rate of return + Premium expected for risk
:Cost of equity = Risk free rate of return + Beta × (market rate of return – risk free rate of return)

where Beta = sensitivity to movements in the relevant market. Thus in symbols we have
:formula_4

where:

:&quot;Es&quot; is the expected return for a security;
:&quot;Rf&quot; is the expected risk-free return in that market (government bond yield);
:&quot;βs&quot; is the sensitivity to market risk for the security;
:&quot;Rm&quot; is the historical return of the stock market; and
:&quot;(Rm – Rf)&quot; is the risk premium of market assets over risk free assets.

The risk free rate is the yield on long term bonds in the particular market, such as government bonds.

An alternative to the estimation of the required return by the capital asset pricing model as above, is the use of the Fama–French three-factor model.

===Expected return===
The expected return (or required rate of return for investors) can be calculated with the &quot;dividend capitalization model&quot;, which is
:formula_5.

===Comments===
The models state that investors will expect a return that is the risk-free return plus the security&#x27;s sensitivity to market risk (β) times the market risk premium.

The risk premium varies over time and place, but in some developed countries during the twentieth century it has averaged around 5% whereas in the emerging markets, it can be as high as 7%. The equity market real capital gain return has been about the same as annual real GDP growth. The capital gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been 1.6% per year over the period 1910–2005. The dividends have increased the total &quot;real&quot; return on average equity to the double, about 3.2%.

The sensitivity to market risk (β) is unique for each firm and depends on everything from management to its business and capital structure. This value cannot be known &quot;ex ante&quot; (beforehand), but can be estimated from &quot;ex post&quot; (past) returns and past experience with similar firms.

====Cost of retained earnings/cost of internal equity====
Note that retained earnings are a component of equity, and, therefore, the cost of retained earnings (internal equity) is equal to the cost of equity as explained above. Dividends (earnings that are paid to investors and not retained) are a component of the return on capital to equity holders, and influence the cost of capital through that mechanism.

:Cost of internal equity = [(next year&#x27;s dividend per share/(current market price per share - flotation costs)] + growth rate of dividends)]

==Weighted average cost of capital==
The weighted cost of capital (WACC) is used in finance to measure a firm&#x27;s cost of capital. WACC is not dictated by management. Rather, it represents the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital, or they will invest elsewhere.

The total capital for a firm is the value of its equity (for a firm without outstanding warrants and options, this is the same as the company&#x27;s market capitalization) plus the cost of its debt (the cost of debt should be continually updated as the cost of debt changes as a result of interest rate changes). Notice that the &quot;equity&quot; in the debt to equity ratio is the market value of all equity, not the shareholders&#x27; equity on the balance sheet. To calculate the firm&#x27;s weighted cost of capital, we must first calculate the costs of the individual financing sources: Cost of Debt, Cost of Preference Capital, and Cost of Equity Cap.

Calculation of WACC is an iterative procedure which requires estimation of the fair market value of equity capital if the company is not listed. The Adjusted Present Value method (APV) is much easier to use in this case as it separates the value of the project from the value of its financing program.

==Factors that can affect cost of capital==
Below are a list of factors that might affect the cost of capital.

===Capital structure===
Because of tax advantages on debt issuance, it will be cheaper to issue debt rather than new equity (this is only true for profitable firms, tax breaks are available only to profitable firms). At some point, however, the cost of issuing new debt will be greater than the cost of issuing new equity. This is because adding debt increases the default risk – and thus the interest rate that the company must pay in order to borrow money. By utilizing too much debt in its capital structure, this increased default risk can also drive up the costs for other sources (such as retained earnings and preferred stock) as well. Management must identify the &quot;optimal mix&quot; of financing – the capital structure where the cost of capital is minimized so that the firm&#x27;s value can be maximized.

The Thomson Financial league tables show that global debt issuance exceeds equity issuance with a 90 to 10 margin.

The structure of capital should be determined considering the weighted average cost of capital.

==Current dividend policy==

===Financial and investment decisions===

===Current income tax rates===

===Interest rates===

===Accounting information===
Lambert, Leuz and Verrecchia (2007) have found that the quality of accounting information can affect a firm&#x27;s cost of capital, both directly and indirectly.

===Breakpoint of marginal cost of capital===

==Modigliani–Miller theorem==
If there were no tax advantages for issuing debt, and equity could be freely issued, Miller and Modigliani showed that, under certain assumptions (no tax, no possibility of bankruptcy), the value of a levered firm and the value of an unlevered firm should be the same.

<text>Kadhimiya (, ) or Kadhimayn () is a northern neighbourhood of the city of Baghdad, Iraq. It is about from the city&#x27;s center, on the west bank of the Tigris. &#x27;Kadhimiya&#x27; is also the name of one of nine administrative districts in Baghdad. As the place of al-Kadhimiya Mosque, even before its inception into the urban area of Baghdad, it is regarded as a holy city by Twelver Shia Muslims.

The neighborhood is home to families of upper class aristocratic class, as some of its people worked in goldsmith works and selling. Before the 14 July Revolution, Kadhimiya was inhabited by the parliament members of the royal era. Some of the popular politicians and leaders such as Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali belonged from the region.

== History ==

=== Religious significance ===

The &quot;Kāẓimayn&quot; (&quot;Two who swallow their anger&quot;), from whom the Mosque and area of Kadhimiyyah are named, are the Twelver Shia Imams Musa al-Kadhim and his grandson, Muhammad al-Jawad ibn Ali al-Ridha. The &quot;qubur&quot; (, graves) of the &quot;Kāẓimayn&quot;, and the scholars Mufid and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, are within the premises of the Mosque. The area that now constitutes Al-Kāẓimiyyah was originally the location of a graveyard reserved for members of the Quraysh. This land was set aside for this purpose by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid. In its early history, the town was an important center of Shia learning, perhaps the main center, but over time the town declined, and other cities rose to prominence.

The location of the city has lent it to numerous plunders, that have resulted in damage to its shrines at different times in history. Among the most damage ever experienced by the town was after the Mongol Siege of Baghdad (1258) where the shrine of the Shia Imams was burnt down.

During the Government of Midhat Pasha in the Ottoman Empire, a tramway was built between Baghdad and Kadhiyma in order to transport the pilgrims who traveled to the Shia shrines. The tramway was in service until 1938 when bus services began to be established.

=== Later history ===
Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah lived in this section of Baghdad during His exile from Iran, famously dictating the Hidden Words on the banks of the Tigris river. This makes the city significant for Baháʼí Faith. The area was also an important center of Iraqi revolt against the British after World War I. The Al-Istrabadi family had friendly ties with the people of the royal government, such as Nuri al-Said. In 1941, 13 people were killed and more than 80 people were wounded in a demonstration against an attempt to demolish an old abandoned cemetery. During the 1958 coup by Abdul-Karim Qasim, when the government was toppled, Nuri al-Said sought refuge in the area. Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali, who was from this neighborhood also sought refuge. Later they were captured.

In 2005, a stampede occurred on Al-Aimmah Bridge over the Tigris River. About 1000 people were killed. Iraqi officials executed Saddam Hussein at an American operated facility in al-Kāẓimiyyah known as &quot;Camp Justice&quot;. The execution occurred on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, which attracted global widespread international criticism, even from Saddam&#x27;s opponents.

Baghdad Security Plan: During Operation Imposing Law in 2007, there were rumours that United States&#x27; forces built walls around Al-Kadhimiyya Mosque. According to &quot;Iraqslogger.com&quot;, the protests that resulted were due to an agreement between Iraqi security officials and the Mahdi Army (now called the Peace Companies) that US forces would not come within of the shrine. Pilgrims to the shrine were attacked on 30 April 2016, leading to wider protests.

== Landmarks ==

=== Government and infrastructure ===
* Kadhimiyya Women&#x27;s Prison is in the area. Women on Iraq&#x27;s death row are held at the Shaaba Khamsa death row facility at Camp Justice. As of 2014 the adult women&#x27;s death row had 36 women as well as children even though the facility was only intended to hold 25 women.

* Amil High School for Girls is in this neighborhood.

<text>Roger Taylor MBE (born 14 October 1941) is a British former tennis player. Born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire. He achieved success at several Grand Slam tournaments, reaching the quarter-finals of the French Open in 1973, the semi-finals of Wimbledon during the same year and winning back to back US Open men&#x27;s doubles titles in 1971 and 1972. He also enjoyed particular success in 1970, again reaching the semi-finals of Wimbledon, where he achieved a big upset win over defending champion Rod Laver en route, and the semi-finals of the Australian Open. Taylor also reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1967. His career-high ranking was world No. 7 in 1967, though Taylor was also ranked world No. 8 in 1970 before the ATP rankings began. 

He was active from 1958 to 1982 and won 31 career singles titles, of those toward the end of his career included 6 Grand Prix tour singles titles and 10 doubles titles. 

He was also ranked British No 1 1973 and 1974. Additionally, Taylor scored 29 wins and 11 losses at the Great Britain Davis Cup team. He is a member of the AELTC.

Taylor is the former husband of tennis player Frances MacLennan, whom he married in 1969. The couple had three children.

==Tennis career==
He played his first singles tournament at the South of France Championships in 1958. He won his first singles title in 1959 at the Lee-on-Solent Open. Taylor was the sole British member of the so-called Handsome Eight signed by Lamar Hunt to compete in his newly created World Championship Tennis tour in 1968. He was shown how to play tennis by his mother, Lilian, and he used to play in the various parks across Sheffield, such as Weston Park. He often practised by hitting a tennis ball against a wall.

Taylor endeared himself to millions of viewers during his 1973 Wimbledon quarterfinal match against the 17-year-old Wimbledon debutant Björn Borg. Having already been declared the match winner by the umpire following his match-point serve which was disputed by Borg, Taylor voluntarily offered to replay the point. The linesman then questioned by the umpire as to whether he wished to reconsider his decision, changed his &quot;in&quot; call to &quot;out&quot; and the umpire requested that the point be replayed as a &quot;let&quot;. Taylor subsequently went on to win the match, but lost to eventual champion Jan Kodeš in the semifinals. He won his final singles title at the Fairfield Open Indoors in March 1975.

He played his final singles tournament at the Caribbean International Championships in 1982. He retired from professional tennis in 1983 and following his retirement he operated tennis holidays. He was Great Britain&#x27;s Davis Cup captain from February 2000 until January 2004. Taylor also captained the British ladies Wightman Cup team; steering them to their last victory in the competition in 1978. He was awarded an MBE in the 1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours.

He is currently active on the ITF Seniors Tour and has a singles ranking of 54 as at 2020 in the over 75&#x27;s category. He won the 70+ title at Woking&#x27;s Veterans Open Tournament in 2012. In 2019, he teamed up with Australia&#x27;s Gordon Waygood to win the Men&#x27;s 75 Doubles title at the British Open Seniors Clay Court Championships.

<doc id="695215" wikidata="Q590581" url="?curid=695215" title="Horizon problem">
<text>The horizon problem (also known as the homogeneity problem) is a cosmological fine-tuning problem within the Big Bang model of the universe. It arises due to the difficulty in explaining the observed homogeneity of causally disconnected regions of space in the absence of a mechanism that sets the same initial conditions everywhere. It was first pointed out by Wolfgang Rindler in 1956.

The most commonly accepted solution is cosmic inflation. Different solutions propose a cyclic universe or a variable speed of light.

==Background==

===Astronomical distances and particle horizons===

The distances of observable objects in the night sky correspond to times in the past. We use the light-year (the distance light can travel in the time of one Earth year) to describe these cosmological distances. A galaxy measured at ten billion light-years appears to us as it was ten billion years ago, because the light has taken that long to travel to the observer. If one were to look at a galaxy ten billion light-years away in one direction and another in the opposite direction, the total distance between them is twenty billion light-years. This means that the light from the first has not yet reached the second because the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old. In a more general sense, there are portions of the universe that are visible to us, but invisible to each other, outside each other&#x27;s respective particle horizons.

===Causal information propagation===

In accepted relativistic physical theories, no information can travel faster than the speed of light. In this context, &quot;information&quot; means &quot;any sort of physical interaction&quot;. For instance, heat will naturally flow from a hotter area to a cooler one, and in physics terms, this is one example of information exchange. Given the example above, the two galaxies in question cannot have shared any sort of information; they are not in causal contact. In the absence of common initial conditions, one would expect, then, that their physical properties would be different, and more generally, that the universe as a whole would have varying properties in causally disconnected regions.

===Horizon problem===
Contrary to this expectation, the observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys show that the observable universe is nearly isotropic, which, through the Copernican principle, also implies homogeneity. CMB sky surveys show that the temperatures of the CMB are coordinated to a level of formula_1 where formula_2 is the difference between the observed temperature in a region of the sky and the average temperature of the sky formula_3. This coordination implies that the entire sky, and thus the entire observable universe, must have been causally connected long enough for the universe to come into thermal equilibrium.

According to the Big Bang model, as the density of the expanding universe dropped, it eventually reached a temperature where photons fell out of thermal equilibrium with matter; they decoupled from the electron-proton plasma and began free-streaming across the universe. This moment in time is referred to as the epoch of Recombination, when electrons and protons became bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen; without free electrons to scatter the photons, the photons began free-streaming. This epoch is observed through the CMB. Since we observe the CMB as a background to objects at a smaller redshift, we describe this epoch as the transition of the universe from opaque to transparent. The CMB physically describes the ‘surface of last scattering’ as it appears to us as a surface, or a background, as shown in the figure below.

Note we use conformal time in the following diagrams. Conformal time describes the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from the location of the observer to the farthest observable distance (if the universe stopped expanding right now).

The decoupling, or the last scattering, is thought to have occurred about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, or at a redshift of about formula_4. We can determine both the approximate angular diameter of the universe and the physical size of the particle horizon that had existed at this time.

The angular diameter distance, in terms of redshift formula_5, is described by formula_6. If we assume a flat cosmology then, 
:formula_7

The epoch of recombination occurred during a matter dominated era of the universe, so we can approximate formula_8 as formula_9. Putting these together, we see that the angular diameter distance, or the size of the observable universe for a redshift formula_4 is

:formula_11

Since formula_12, we can approximate the above equation as

:formula_13

Substituting this into our definition of angular diameter distance, we obtain

:formula_14

From this formula, we obtain the angular diameter distance of the cosmic microwave background as formula_15.

The particle horizon describes the maximum distance light particles could have traveled to the observer given the age of the universe. We can determine the comoving distance for the age of the universe at the time of recombination using formula_16 from earlier,

:formula_17

To get the physical size of the particle horizon formula_18, 
:formula_19
:formula_20

We would expect any region of the CMB within 2 degrees of angular separation to have been in causal contact, but at any scale larger than 2° there should have been no exchange of information.

CMB regions that are separated by more than 2° lie outside one another&#x27;s particle horizons and are causally disconnected. The horizon problem describes the fact that we see isotropy in the CMB temperature across the entire sky, despite the entire sky not being in causal contact to establish thermal equilibrium. Refer to the timespace diagram to the right for a visualization of this problem.

If the universe started with even slightly different temperatures in different places, the CMB should not be isotropic unless there is a mechanism that evens out the temperature by the time of decoupling. In reality, the CMB has the same temperature in the entire sky, .

==Inflationary model==
The theory of cosmic inflation has attempted to address the problem by positing a 10-second period of exponential expansion in the first second of the history of the universe due to a scalar field interaction. According to the inflationary model, the universe increased in size by a factor of more than 10, from a small and causally connected region in near equilibrium. Inflation then expanded the universe rapidly, isolating nearby regions of spacetime by growing them beyond the limits of causal contact, effectively &quot;locking in&quot; the uniformity at large distances. Essentially, the inflationary model suggests that the universe was entirely in causal contact in the very early universe. Inflation then expands this universe by approximately 60 e-foldings (the scale factor increases by factor formula_21). We observe the CMB after inflation has occurred at a very large scale. It maintained thermal equilibrium to this large size because of the rapid expansion from inflation.

One consequence of cosmic inflation is that the anisotropies in the Big Bang due to quantum fluctuations are reduced but not eliminated. Differences in the temperature of the cosmic background are smoothed by cosmic inflation, but they still exist. The theory predicts a spectrum for the anisotropies in the microwave background which is mostly consistent with observations from WMAP and COBE.

However, gravity alone may be sufficient to explain this homogeneity.

==Variable-speed-of-light theories==

Cosmological models employing a variable speed of light have been proposed to resolve the horizon problem of and provide an alternative to cosmic inflation. In the VSL models, the fundamental constant &quot;c&quot;, denoting the speed of light in vacuum, is greater in the early universe than its present value, effectively increasing the particle horizon at the time of decoupling sufficiently to account for the observed isotropy of the CMB.

<text>Victoria Newman is a fictional character from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, an American soap opera on the CBS network. Created by William J. Bell, she is currently portrayed by Amelia Heinle. Victoria was born onscreen in 1982 and was portrayed by child actress Ashley Nicole Millan for her first eight years. Having been rapidly aged to a teenager, Victoria returned to the soap opera and was portrayed by Heather Tom. Tom portrayed the character into her early adult years and remained in the role for thirteen years. Due to creative differences, Tom left the soap opera in 2003 and Heinle, who debuted as Victoria on March 21, 2005, was cast in the role.

The daughter of businessman Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), Victoria was described as &quot;the teenager from hell&quot; during her early years, and as an adult she was written as a ruthless character. Her storylines have involved romances with older men, family conflicts, and difficult pregnancies. Victoria is the third member of the Newman family to appear in the program and was joined later by her younger siblings. Her early romances included long-standing relationships with Ryan McNeil (Scott Reeves) and Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck). Upon her second return to the show she had relationships with J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill) and Billy Abbott (Jason Thompson). Victoria has four children: Claire Grace (Hayley Erin) by Cole, Reed Hellstrom (Tristan Lake Leabu) by J.T., Johnny Abbott, Billy&#x27;s son whom she adopted as her own, and Katie Abbott.

Tom won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series twice for her portrayal of Victoria, and received nominations for eight other Emmy awards. Critics praised Tom&#x27;s portrayal of the character, though her marriages at an early age were criticized. Heinle&#x27;s portrayal later won her the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2015.

== Casting ==
Between 1982 and 1990, Victoria was portrayed by child actress Ashley Nicole Millan. After Millan left the series, Victoria was rapidly aged to become a teenager, and Heather Tom assumed the role on December 12, 1990. In 1997, Tom took a nearly eight-month leave of absence from the role, departing on February 21 and returning on October 2. During Tom&#x27;s absence, Sarah Aldrich was cast as her temporary replacement, appearing from April 2 to July 17, 1997.

In 1999, Carrie Genzel was in talks to replace Tom, who was experiencing &quot;touch-and-go&quot; contract negotiations. However, Tom signed another three-year deal with the soap opera and said she was &quot;very excited&quot; about her continuation. In September 2003, Tom&#x27;s spokesman announced that she would leave the show because of &quot;creative differences&quot; with executive producer David Shaughnessy. Speaking of her departure, Shaughnessy said that it was &quot;tough&quot; to see her go and that &quot;they would miss her tremendously&quot;. Tom made her final appearance as Victoria on December 17, 2003, and she later said that she left the role because &quot;things weren&#x27;t going in her best interests&quot;.

The soap opera&#x27;s producers intended Victoria to return in January 2004 but auditions failed to find a suitable replacement for Tom. Amelia Heinle was later cast in the role and made her first appearance on March 21, 2005. Rachel Kimsey also auditioned for the role and Heinle had auditioned for Mackenzie Browning; Kimsey was given Mackenzie and Heinle was given Victoria. Heinle has stated on many occasions that she had &quot;serious doubts&quot; about taking over Tom&#x27;s role. In 2013, she recalled on what intimidated her about Tom, saying: &quot;Heather is pure backbone, and that&#x27;s probably what intimidated me about following in her footsteps because that&#x27;s not me naturally.&quot; In 2008, she took maternity leave and was off-screen for weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heinle/Luckinbill Interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Heinle announced that she had signed a new contract which would secure her in the role for an unspecified period. In November 2013, it was announced that Heinle had signed another contract to continue her portrayal of Victoria for an additional two years.

==Development==
===Characterization and portrayal===
According to SoapNet, Victoria is &quot;ruthless in the board room&quot; and &quot;nobody&#x27;s damsel in distress&quot;. The soap opera&#x27;s official website describes the character as having &quot;displayed both her father&#x27;s headstrong qualities and her mother&#x27;s tendency to be impulsive&quot;. While the character was a teenager, Kelly O&#x27;Sullivan of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called her &quot;the teen from hell&quot;. Heather Tom said that Victoria had Victor&#x27;s strength and the manipulative skills of her former-alcoholic mother Nikki. Of the character&#x27;s determination, Tom said that &quot;Victoria knows disappointment, yet she gets her way most of the time&quot; and &quot;she goes after what she wants, and wins&quot;. During Victoria&#x27;s divorce from Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that Victoria&#x27;s behavior was &quot;pig-faced&quot;.

===Relationships===
Victoria has her first romance with Ryan McNeil, which ends when he leaves her for Nina Webster (Tricia Cast). The series&#x27; creator William J. Bell said that Victoria knew Nina still loved Ryan and suspected that the marriage would not last, and that &quot;in Victoria&#x27;s mind, the threat is still there&quot;. She is then married to Cole Howard for four years but they begin to have marital problems after Cole&#x27;s affair with Ashley Abbott (Shari Shattuck). Tom said that being married on a soap opera is &quot;short lived&quot; and that she knew Cole and Victoria would eventually face difficulties, which she found challenging to act. While pregnant with Cole&#x27;s child, Victoria has a relationship with Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) and plans to raise the child with him, but her daughter Eve Howard dies shortly after birth and she and Neil separate. After being raped by an insane man, Victoria reunites with Ryan and they plan to marry before he is shot dead by his ex-wife, Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet). Victoria also has brief relationships with Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan) and Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc).

A decade after her marriage to Cole, Victoria marries Brad Carlton (Don Diamont); their marriage ends after Brad has an affair. She then becomes pregnant with J.T. Hellstrom&#x27;s (Thad Luckinbill) child and during her pregnancy becomes comatose. Heinle believed Victoria and J.T. would &quot;stay together for a while before they wreck it&quot;. After it was announced that Luckinbill was leaving the soap opera, Victoria and J.T. drift apart and eventually divorce. Victoria next begins a relationship with Billy Abbott that their feuding families are against; Heinle described Billy as &quot;the forbidden fruit&quot; and compared their romance to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. They later marry in a 1950s-styled screen wedding; her wedding dress was inspired by a gown worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film &quot;Funny Face&quot;. Actress Elinor Donahue was cast to portray the judge that officiates their wedding, as former co-head writer Scott Hamner felt that Donahue could help them achieve the sense of a &quot;retro-fantasy of better, simpler times&quot;. After their wedding, Billy illegally purchases a baby girl for Victoria. Heinle felt this plot was a good way to add conflict drama to the soap opera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heinle/Miller Interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lose custody of the child, Billy leaves Genoa City and Victoria divorces him, but her father hides Billy from his family. The pair are later reunited in a New York airport bar. Hamner noted that Victoria would be &quot;absolutely furious&quot; at her father for what he had done: &quot;[There is a] potential for a huge rift between father and daughter, and there will be some consequences for Victor with his relationship with Victoria in light of all that he&#x27;s done to keep her apart from the man she loves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria/Billy Reunite&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that the &quot;impact of those secrets coming to light was going to be very serious in Billy and Victoria&#x27;s ability to move forward together&quot;.

== Reception ==

Connie Passalacqua of the &quot;Herald Journal&quot; compared Victoria&#x27;s scheme to reunite her parents in 1991 to the plot of the 1961 film &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. She wrote, &quot;[w]hat makes Victoria a true terror teen? We venture that it may be the supernatural soap aging by which she aged from 5 to 15 last fall.&quot; &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; criticized Victoria&#x27;s early romances, saying: &quot;[s]he&#x27;s divorced, rich and hates sex. And now she wants her husband back. As soap operas go, Victoria Newman&#x27;s plight ... is standard daytime fare. But Victoria has one characteristic that many of her counterparts don&#x27;t—she is only 17.&quot; A syndicated article that appeared in &quot;The Fort Oglethorpe Press&quot; described Ryan McNeil&#x27;s attempts to seduce Victoria as &quot;a path that&#x27;s fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration&quot;. SoapNet said it was &quot;no surprise&quot; Victoria has a history of &quot;messy relationships&quot; given her parents&#x27; history. Lilana Novakovich of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; said that Heather Tom made Victoria become &quot;one of her favorite characters&quot; on the soap upon her debut in 1991. &quot;The Austin American-Statesman&quot; said that Tom was &quot;always a pleasure to watch&quot;.

Dan J. Kroll of the website SoapCentral wrote that the process to find a replacement for Tom was an &quot;exhaustive search&quot;. Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the &quot;Top 5 Actresses&quot; poll of &quot;CBS Soaps in Depth&quot; for over eight consecutive weeks. Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead &quot;CBS Soaps in Depth&quot;″s &quot;Top 10 Couples&quot; poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, said she thought their &quot;retro wedding&quot; was &quot;adorable&quot; and &quot;extremely well written and not overdone&quot;. Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their &quot;10 Best Soap Couples of 2011&quot;. Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are &quot;so scrumptious together&quot;, and that &quot;it&#x27;s so nice to have some reason to say something kind about &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; for a change&quot;. Giddens also said that he &quot;adores this pairing that he was so prepared to hate&quot;. Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: &quot;Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from &quot;until death to us part,&quot; to &quot;until one of us changes our mind.&quot; However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.

In 2011, during a storyline that saw Victoria and her siblings sue their father for control of a cosmetics line, Bibel wrote: &quot;Victoria, whose true motivation was to get her hands on Beauty of Nature so she could become its CEO, got a rude awakening when Nick told her in no uncertain terms that he had no interest in trading the settlement money for the company. I think the second stage of the battle will be the Newman siblings squabbling over the money a la King Lear, assuming the show actually allows Victor to lose for more than a few episodes.&quot; Soon after, Bibel said that Victoria had been &quot;whiny&quot; and found the character&#x27;s mother Nikki&#x27;s storyline &quot;far more interesting&quot;. That same year, Giddens wrote that a blogger from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared Victoria to Rupert Murdoch, saying: &quot;[a] partial nod must go to the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, whose character Victoria Newman was arrested on her wedding day for allegedly bribing a foreign dignitary. Television and Murdoch and ’round-the-clock FCPA conjectureit&#x27;s a welcome publicity storm for the FCPA bar.&quot;

In 2013, Bibel criticized the soap opera when Victoria &quot;decided to give up a corporate career to become a children’s book author&quot;, writing: &quot;From the time she was SORASED into a teen, Victoria’s ambition was to run Newman Enterprises. She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her.&quot; She also stated that while watching the series, there was &quot;the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players&quot;. Of Victoria&#x27;s choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: &quot;For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn&#x27;t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn&#x27;t know. I got to thinking about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of &quot;Leaning In&quot;, the most popular non-fiction book in the country right now, leaning out.&quot; Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood blamed head writer Josh Griffith for turning the character into a &quot;hard-nosed unforgiving socialite&quot;.

Heather Tom won two Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Victoria in 1993 and 1999, and received eight other nominations for the same award. She also won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Leading Younger Actress in 1997, and was nominated for two other awards.

In 2022, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Victoria 23rd on his list of the best 25 characters from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, saying &quot;Passion&#x27;s plaything. Daddy&#x27;s girl. Boss lady. Whatever you choose to call Victoria, from Heather Tom to Amelia Heinle, she’s always been front and center, a lightning rod for electric storylines.&quot;

<text>Postmodern dance is a 20th century concert dance movement that came into popularity in the early 1960s. While the term &quot;postmodern&quot; took on a different meaning when used to describe dance, the dance form did take inspiration from the ideologies of the wider postmodern movement, which &quot;sought to deflate what it saw as overly pretentious and ultimately self-serving modernist views of art and the artist&quot; and was, more generally, a departure from modernist ideals. Lacking stylistic homogeny, postmodern dance was discerned mainly by its anti-modern dance sentiments rather than by its dance style. The dance form was a reaction to the compositional and presentational constraints of the preceding generation of modern dance, hailing the use of everyday movement as valid performance art and advocating for unconventional methods of dance composition.

Postmodern dance made the claim that all movement was dance expression and any person was a dancer regardless of training. In this, early postmodern dance was more closely aligned with the ideologies of modernism rather than the architectural, literary and design movements of postmodernism. However, the postmodern dance movement rapidly developed to embrace the ideas of postmodernism, which rely on chance, self-referentiality, irony, and fragmentation. Judson Dance Theater, the postmodernist collective active in New York in the 1960s, is credited as a pioneer of postmodern dance and its ideas.

The peak popularity of Postmodern dance as a performance art was relatively short, lasting from the early 1960s to the mid 1980s, but due to the changing definitions of postmodernism, it technically reaches the mid 1990s and beyond. The form&#x27;s influence can be seen in various other dance forms, especially contemporary dance, and in postmodern choreographic processes that are utilized by choreographers in a wide range of dance works.

== Influences ==
Postmodern dance can be understood as a continuation in dance history: stemming from early modernist choreographers like Isadora Duncan, who rejected the rigidity of an academic approach to movement, and modernists like Martha Graham, whose emotion-filled choreography sought to exploit gravity, unlike the illusionistic floating of ballet.

Merce Cunningham, who studied under Graham, was one of the first choreographers to take major departures from the then-formalized modern dance in the 1950s. Among his innovations was the severance of the connection between music and dance, leaving the two to operate by their own logic. He also removed dance performance from the proscenium stage. To Cunningham, dance could be anything, but its foundation was in the human body— specifically beginning with walking. He also incorporated chance into his work, using methods like tossing dice or coins at random to determine movements in a phrase. These innovations would become essential to the ideas in postmodern dance, however, Cunningham’s work remained grounded in the tradition of dance technique, which would later be eschewed by the postmodernist.

Other avant-garde artists who influenced the postmodernists include John Cage, Anna Halprin, Simone Forti, and other choreographers of the 1950s, as well as non-dance artistic movements such as Fluxus (a neo-dada group), Happenings, and Events. 

==Characteristics==
Major characteristics of postmodern dance of the 1960s and 1970s can be attributed to its goals of questioning the process behind and reasons for dance-making while simultaneously challenging the expectations of the audience. Many dancemakers employed improvisation, spontaneous determination, and chance to create their works, instead of rigid choreography. In order to demystify and draw attention away from technique-driven dance, pedestrian movement was also employed to include everyday and casual postures. In some cases, choreographers cast non-trained dancers. Furthermore, movement was no longer bound to the tempo created by accompanying music, but to actual time. One dance artist, Yvonne Rainer, did not inflect her phrasing, which had the effect of flattening the amount of time passing as dynamics no longer had a role to play between time and dance.

== Evolution ==

=== Early postmodern dance ===
The earliest usage of the term &quot;postmodern&quot; in dance was in the early 1960s. During the formative years of the performance art, the only defining characteristic was the participants&#x27; rejection of its predecessor, modern dance. The pioneer choreographers utilized unconventional methods, such as chance procedures and improvisation. Chance procedure, also known as dance by chance, is a method of choreography &quot;based on the idea that there are no prescribed movement materials or orders for a series of actions.&quot; This means that the chance methods, which could be the toss of a coin, determine the movements rather than the choreographer. Dance by chance was not a distinctly postmodern method – it was first used by modern dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. Thus, despite their adamant rejection of their predecessors, many early postmodern choreographers embraced the techniques of modern and classical ballet.

=== Analytical postmodern dance ===
As postmodern dance progressed into the 1970s, a more identifiable, postmodern style emerged. Sally Banes uses the term &quot;analytical postmodern&quot; to describe the form during the 70s. It was more conceptual, abstract, and distanced itself from expressive elements such as music, lighting, costumes, and props. In this way, analytical postmodern dance aligned more with modernist criteria as defined by art critic Clement Greenberg. Analytical postmodern &quot;became objective as it was distanced from personal expression through the use of scores, bodily attitudes that suggested work and other ordinary movements, verbal commentaries, and tasks.&quot; Modernist influence can also be seen in the analytical postmodern choreographers&#x27; use of minimalism, a method used in art that relies on &quot;excessive simplicity and objective approach.&quot;

Analytical postmodern dance was also heavily influenced by the political activism taking place in the U.S. during the late 60s and early 70s. The Black Power movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement, the second-wave feminist movement, and the LGBTQ movement all became more explicitly explored in analytical postmodern dance. Many postmodern dancers during this time, despite their Euro-American backgrounds, were heavily influenced by African-American and Asian forms of dance, music and martial arts.

=== Postmodern dance 1980 and beyond ===
The 1980s saw a distancing from the analytical postmodern dance of the previous decade, and a return to expression in meaning, which was rejected by the postmodern dance of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. Though stylistically, postmodern dance of the &#x27;80s and beyond lacked a unifying style, specific aspects could be seen throughout the work of various choreographers. The form took on an &quot;alliance with the avant/pop music world&quot; and saw increased distribution on international main stages, with performances in venues such as City Center and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, both in New York City. There was also an increased interesting in preserving dance on film, in repertory, etc., which contrasts the improvisational attitudes of early postmodern dance choreographers.

Another aspect that unifies the postmodern dance of 1980 forward is the interest in &quot;narrative content and the traditions of dance history.&quot; The more recent forms of postmodern dance have distanced themselves from the formalism of the &#x27;70s and began a greater exploration into &quot;meaning of all kinds, from virtuosic skill to language and gesture systems to narrative, autobiography, character, and political manifestos.&quot;

== Postmodern choreographic process ==
Postmodern dance utilized many unconventional methods during the choreographic process. One of the main methods used was chance, which is a technique pioneered in dance by Merce Cunningham that relied on the idea that there were &quot;no prescribed movement materials or orders for a series of action.&quot; Choreographers would use random numbers and equations or even roll dice to determine &quot;how to sequence choreographic phrases, how many dancers would perform at any given point, where they would stand on stage, and where they would enter and exit.” In using the chance technique, it was not uncommon for dancers in a postmodern piece to hear the music they were dancing to for the first time during the premiere performance.

Postmodern choreographers also often utilized an objectivism similar to literary theorist Roland Barthes&#x27; idea of &quot;death of the author.&quot; Narratives were rarely conveyed in postmodern dance, with the choreographer more focused on &quot;creating an objective presence.&quot; Performances were stripped down – dancers wore simple costumes, the music was minimalist or, in some cases, nonexistent, and performances often &quot;[unfolded] in objective or clock-time rather than a theatrically-condensed or musically-abstract time.&quot; In this, postmodern choreography reflects the objective present, rather than the thoughts and ideas of the choreographer.

Although postmodern choreography may have seldom conveyed conventional narrative, postmodern artists of the 1960s and 1970s have also been known to make dances with implicit or explicit political themes. Yvonne Rainer has a history of politically conscious and active dance-making. For example, while still recovering from a major abdominal surgery, she performed her work Trio A and called it Convalescent Dance as part of a program of anti-Vietnam War works during Angry Arts Week in 1967. The works Steve Paxton created in the 1960s also were politically sensitive, exploring issues of censorship, war, and political corruption.

<text>The Cardiff City Soul Crew (commonly known as the Soul Crew) is a football hooligan firm, associated with the Welsh football club Cardiff City. From its formation in 1983 onwards, the Soul Crew would on many occasions become one of the most active football firms in the United Kingdom.

==Background==

The Soul Crew name was adopted by hooligan followers of Cardiff City in the 1982/83 season, and comes from the small number of aspirant hooligans that had an enthusiasm for soul music. It was alleged that Don Cornelius, former host of the TV show &quot;Soul Train&quot; gave his blessings for the group to be known as &quot;The Soul Crew&quot;. They were featured in the 2002 documentary series, &quot;Hooligans&quot; on BBC.

Eleven suspected members of the Soul Crew were detained before the start of an FA Cup replay against Reading at Ninian Park in February 1998. Riot police were drafted in at the end of the game to prevent further outbreaks of violence between the Soul Crew and Reading&#x27;s Berkshire Boot Boys.
