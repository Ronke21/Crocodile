<text>A bank run or run on the bank occurs when many clients withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may fail in the near future. In other words, it is when, in a fractional-reserve banking system (where banks normally only keep a small proportion of their assets as cash), numerous customers withdraw cash from deposit accounts with a financial institution at the same time because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, insolvent. When they transfer funds to another institution, it may be characterized as a capital flight. As a bank run progresses, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more people withdraw cash, the likelihood of default increases, triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden bankruptcy. To combat a bank run, a bank may acquire more cash from other banks or from the central bank, or limit the amount of cash customers may withdraw, either by imposing a hard limit or by scheduling quick deliveries of cash, encouraging high-return term deposits to reduce on-demand withdrawals or suspending withdrawals altogether.

A banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out. The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down. According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the failure of the Federal Reserve System to prevent deflation, and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs. The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.

Several techniques have been used to try to prevent bank runs or mitigate their effects. They have included a higher reserve requirement (requiring banks to keep more of their reserves as cash), government bailouts of banks, supervision and regulation of commercial banks, the organization of central banks that act as a lender of last resort, the protection of deposit insurance systems such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and after a run has started, a temporary suspension of withdrawals. These techniques do not always work: for example, even with deposit insurance, depositors may still be motivated by beliefs they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.

==History==


Bank runs first appeared as a part of cycles of credit expansion and its subsequent contraction. From the 16th century onwards, English goldsmiths issuing promissory notes suffered severe failures due to bad harvests, plummeting parts of the country into famine and unrest. Other examples are the Dutch tulip manias (1634–37), the British South Sea Bubble (1717–19), the French Mississippi Company (1717–20), the post-Napoleonic depression (1815–30), and the Great Depression (1929–39).

Bank runs have also been used to blackmail individuals and governments. In 1832, for example, the British government under the Duke of Wellington overturned a majority government on the orders of the king, William IV, to prevent reform (the later Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45)). Wellington&#x27;s actions angered reformers, and they threatened a run on the banks under the rallying cry &quot;Stop the Duke, go for gold!&quot;.

Many of the recessions in the United States were caused by banking panics. The Great Depression contained several banking crises consisting of runs on multiple banks from 1929 to 1933; some of these were specific to regions of the U.S. Bank runs were most common in states whose laws allowed banks to operate only a single branch, dramatically increasing risk compared to banks with multiple branches particularly when single-branch banks were located in areas economically dependent on a single industry.

Banking panics began in the Southern United States in November 1930, one year after the stock market crash, triggered by the collapse of a string of banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, which brought down their correspondent networks. In December, New York City experienced massive bank runs that were contained to the many branches of a single bank. Philadelphia was hit a week later by bank runs that affected several banks, but were successfully contained by quick action by the leading city banks and the Federal Reserve Bank. Withdrawals became worse after financial conglomerates in New York and Los Angeles failed in prominently-covered scandals. Much of the US Depression&#x27;s economic damage was caused directly by bank runs, though Canada had no bank runs during this same era due to different banking regulations.
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that steady withdrawals from banks by nervous depositors (&quot;hoarding&quot;) were inspired by news of the fall 1930 bank runs and forced banks to liquidate loans, which directly caused a decrease in the money supply, shrinking the economy. Bank runs continued to plague the United States for the next several years. Citywide runs hit Boston (December 1931), Chicago (June 1931 and June 1932), Toledo (June 1931), and St. Louis (January 1933), among others. Institutions put into place during the Depression have prevented runs on U.S. commercial banks since the 1930s, even under conditions such as the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.

The 2007–2008 financial crisis was centered around market-liquidity failures that were comparable to a bank run. The crisis contained a wave of bank nationalizations, including those associated with Northern Rock of the UK and IndyMac of the U.S. This crisis was caused by low real interest rates stimulating an asset price bubble fuelled by new financial products that were not stress tested and that failed in the downturn.

==Theory==

Under fractional-reserve banking, the type of banking currently used in most developed countries, banks retain only a fraction of their demand deposits as cash. The remainder is invested in securities and loans, whose terms are typically longer than the demand deposits, resulting in an asset–liability mismatch. No bank has enough reserves on hand to cope with all deposits being taken out at once.

Diamond and Dybvig developed an influential model to explain why bank runs occur and why banks issue deposits that are more liquid than their assets. According to the model, the bank acts as an intermediary between borrowers who prefer long-maturity loans and depositors who prefer liquid accounts. The Diamond–Dybvig model provides an example of an economic game with more than one Nash equilibrium, where it is logical for individual depositors to engage in a bank run once they suspect one might start, even though that run will cause the bank to collapse.

In the model, business investment requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns that take time in coming, for example, spending on machines and buildings now for production in future years. A business or entrepreneur that needs to borrow to finance investment will want to give their investments a long time to generate returns before full repayment, and will prefer long maturity loans, which offer little liquidity to the lender. The same principle applies to individuals and households seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. The households and firms who have the money to lend to these businesses may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, so they are often willing to lend only on the condition of being guaranteed immediate access to their money in the form of liquid demand deposit accounts, that is, accounts with shortest possible maturity. Since borrowers need money and depositors fear to make these loans individually, banks provide a valuable service by aggregating funds from many individual deposits, portioning them into loans for borrowers, and spreading the risks both of default and sudden demands for cash. Banks can charge much higher interest on their long-term loans than they pay out on demand deposits, allowing them to earn a profit.
If only a few depositors withdraw at any given time, this arrangement works well. Barring some major emergency on a scale matching or exceeding the bank&#x27;s geographical area of operation, depositors&#x27; unpredictable needs for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time; that is, by the law of large numbers, banks can expect only a small percentage of accounts withdrawn on any one day because individual expenditure needs are largely uncorrelated. A bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors who may demand withdrawals.

However, if many depositors withdraw all at once, the bank itself (as opposed to individual investors) may run short of liquidity, and depositors will rush to withdraw their money, forcing the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss, and eventually to fail. If such a bank were to attempt to call in its loans early, businesses might be forced to disrupt their production while individuals might need to sell their homes and/or vehicles, causing further losses to the larger economy. Even so, many, if not most, debtors would be unable to pay the bank in full on demand and would be forced to declare bankruptcy, possibly affecting other creditors in the process.

A bank run can occur even when started by a false story. Even depositors who know the story is false will have an incentive to withdraw, if they suspect other depositors will believe the story. The story becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Indeed, Robert K. Merton, who coined the term &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot;, mentioned bank runs as a prime example of the concept in his book &quot;Social Theory and Social Structure&quot;. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, once noted that it may not be rational to start a bank run, but it is rational to participate in one once it had started.

==Systemic banking crisis==
A bank run is the sudden withdrawal of deposits of just one bank. A &quot;banking panic&quot; or &quot;bank panic&quot; is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as a cascading failure. In a &quot;systemic banking crisis&quot;, all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out; this can result when regulators ignore systemic risks and spillover effects.

Systemic banking crises are associated with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses. Frequently, emergency liquidity support and blanket guarantees have been used to contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy.

Some measures are more effective than others in containing economic fallout and restoring the banking system after a systemic crisis. These include establishing the scale of the problem, targeted debt relief programs to distressed borrowers, corporate restructuring programs, recognizing bank losses, and adequately capitalizing banks. Speed of intervention appears to be crucial; intervention is often delayed in the hope that insolvent banks will recover if given liquidity support and relaxation of regulations, and in the end this delay increases stress on the economy. Programs that are targeted, that specify clear quantifiable rules that limit access to preferred assistance, and that contain meaningful standards for capital regulation, appear to be more successful. According to IMF, government-owned asset management companies (bad banks) are largely ineffective due to political constraints.

A &quot;silent run&quot; occurs when the implicit fiscal deficit from a government&#x27;s unbooked loss exposure to zombie banks is large enough to deter depositors of those banks. As more depositors and investors begin to doubt whether a government can support a country&#x27;s banking system, the silent run on the system can gather steam, causing the zombie banks&#x27; funding costs to increase. If a zombie bank sells some assets at market value, its remaining assets contain a larger fraction of unbooked losses; if it rolls over its liabilities at increased interest rates, it squeezes its profits along with the profits of healthier competitors. The longer the silent run goes on, the more benefits are transferred from healthy banks and taxpayers to the zombie banks. The term is also used when many depositors in countries with deposit insurance draw down their balances below the limit for deposit insurance.

The cost of cleaning up after a crisis can be huge. In systemically important banking crises in the world from 1970 to 2007, the average net recapitalization cost to the government was 6% of GDP, fiscal costs associated with crisis management averaged 13% of GDP (16% of GDP if expense recoveries are ignored), and economic output losses averaged about 20% of GDP during the first four years of the crisis.

==Prevention and mitigation==

Several techniques have been used to help prevent or mitigate bank runs.

=== Individual banks ===
Some prevention techniques apply to individual banks, independently of the rest of the economy.
* Banks often project an appearance of stability, with solid architecture and conservative dress.
* A bank may try to hide information that might spark a run. For example, in the days before deposit insurance, it made sense for a bank to have a large lobby and fast service, to prevent the formation of a line of depositors extending out into the street which might cause passers-by to infer a bank run.
* A bank may try to slow down the bank run by artificially slowing the process. One technique is to get a large number of friends and relatives of bank employees to stand in line and make many small, slow transactions.
* Scheduling prominent deliveries of cash can convince participants in a bank run that there is no need to withdraw deposits hastily.
* Banks can encourage customers to make term deposits that cannot be withdrawn on demand. If term deposits form a high enough percentage of a bank&#x27;s liabilities, its vulnerability to bank runs will be reduced considerably. The drawback is that banks have to pay a higher interest rate on term deposits.
* A bank can temporarily suspend withdrawals to stop a run; this is called &quot;suspension of convertibility&quot;. In many cases, the threat of suspension prevents the run, which means the threat need not be carried out.
* Emergency acquisition of a vulnerable bank by another institution with stronger capital reserves. This technique is commonly used by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to dispose of insolvent banks, rather than paying depositors directly from its own funds.
* If there is no immediate prospective buyer for a failing institution, a regulator or deposit insurer may set up a bridge bank which operates temporarily until the business can be liquidated or sold.
* To clean up after a bank failure, the government may set up a &quot;bad bank&quot;, which is a new government-run asset management corporation that buys individual nonperforming assets from one or more private banks, reducing the proportion of junk bonds in their asset pools, and then acts as the creditor in the insolvency cases that follow. This, however, creates a moral hazard problem, essentially subsidizing bankruptcy: temporarily underperforming debtors can be forced to file for bankruptcy in order to make them eligible to be sold to the bad bank.

=== Systemic techniques ===
Some prevention techniques apply across the whole economy, though they may still allow individual institutions to fail.
* Deposit insurance systems insure each depositor up to a certain amount, so that depositors&#x27; savings are protected even if the bank fails. This removes the incentive to withdraw one&#x27;s deposits simply because others are withdrawing theirs. However, depositors may still be motivated by fears they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization. To avoid such fears triggering a run, the U.S. FDIC keeps its takeover operations secret, and re-opens branches under new ownership on the next business day. Government deposit insurance programs can be ineffective if the government itself is perceived to be running short of cash.
* Bank capital requirements reduces the possibility that a bank becomes insolvent. The Basel III agreement strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.
** Full-reserve banking is the hypothetical case where the reserve ratio is set to 100%, and funds deposited are not lent out by the bank as long as the depositor retains the legal right to withdraw the funds on demand. Under this approach, banks would be forced to match maturities of loans and deposits, thus greatly reducing the risk of bank runs.
** A less severe alternative to full-reserve banking is a reserve ratio requirement, which limits the proportion of deposits which a bank can lend out, making it less likely for a bank run to start, as more reserves will be available to satisfy the demands of depositors. This practice sets a limit on the fraction in fractional-reserve banking.
* Transparency may help prevent crises from spreading through the banking system. In the context of the 2007-2010 subprime mortgage crisis, the extreme complexity of certain types of assets made it difficult for market participants to assess which financial institutions would survive, which amplified the crisis by making most institutions very reluctant to lend to one another.
* Central banks act as a lender of last resort. To prevent a bank run, the central bank guarantees that it will make short-term loans to banks, to ensure that, if they remain economically viable, they will always have enough liquidity to honor their deposits. Walter Bagehot&#x27;s book &quot;Lombard Street&quot; provides an influential early analysis of the role of the lender of last resort.

The role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create moral hazard, since they reduce banks&#x27; incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking.

Techniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed:
* Declaring an emergency bank holiday
* Government or central bank announcements of increased lines of credit, loans, or bailouts for vulnerable banks

==Depictions in fiction==

The bank panic of 1933 is the setting of Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s 1935 play, &quot;Panic&quot;. Motion picture depictions of bank runs include those in &quot;American Madness&quot; (1932), &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946, set in 1932), &quot;Silver River&quot; (1948), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964, set in 1910 London), &quot;Rollover&quot; (1981), &quot;Noble House&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Pope Must Die&quot; (1991).

Arthur Hailey&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; includes a potentially fatal run on a fictional American bank.

A run on a bank is one of the many causes of the characters&#x27; suffering in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot;, Bart Simpson starts a whisper campaign at the Bank of Springfield as a prank to instigate a bank run. The episode spoofs &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

<text>A squeegee is a tool with a flat, smooth rubber blade, used to remove or control the flow of liquid on a flat surface. It is used for cleaning and in printing.

The earliest written references to squeegees date from the mid-18th century and concern deck-cleaning tools, some with leather rather than rubber blades. The name &quot;squeegee&quot; may come from the word &quot;squeege&quot;, meaning press or squeeze, which was first recorded in 1783. The closely related &quot;squeedging&quot; was reportedly first used in 1782, in the Covent Garden Theatre, during the performing of the comedy &quot;Which is the Man?&quot; by Hannah Cowley.

==Window cleaning==

The best-known of these tools is probably the hand-held window squeegee, used to remove the cleaning fluid or water from a glass surface. A soapy solution acts as a lubricant and breaks up the dirt, then the squeegee is used to draw the now water-borne dirt off the glass leaving a clean surface. Some squeegees are backed with a sponge which can soak up soapy water from a bucket for application to a dirty window.

Squeegees were in use for cleaning windows by 1918 when an American book on navy jargon explained that a deck-cleaning tool called a squeegee was &quot;used in civil life to clean windows&quot;. This is the earliest written reference to a window cleaning squeegee given by the Oxford English Dictionary. (For earlier uses see &quot;floor cleaning&quot; section below.)

With the development of the skyscraper in the 20th century, a more efficient tool for the cleaning of window exteriors was needed. Professional window washers began using the Chicago squeegee, a bulky tool with two heavy pink rubber blades. Changing the blades required the loosening of twelve separate screws. The modern single-blade window cleaning squeegee was patented by Ettore Steccone in 1936, who dubbed it the &quot;New Deal&quot;. It was made of lightweight brass with a very flexible and sharp rubber blade. Steccone began a manufacturing process and sold the product in his garage. The Ettore Products Co. is still the leader in the squeegee market today. Squeegee kits can include a telescoping pole to extend the washer&#x27;s reach.

Simple squeegees are made in various shapes for household use, including the cleaning of shower doors, bathroom tile, and garage floors.

There is a double-sided squeegee model. On one side is the classic squeegee, on the other side is a soft sponge for applying the detergent. The squeegee is usually sold with a short handle.

Companies produce squeegees for home use, as well as professional squeegees for use by cleaning companies and private glass cleaners who provide services to the public.

Professional squeegees are made from:
*plastic;
*stainless steel;
*sometimes a rubber non-slip coating is applied to the handle.

Tools can be equipped with swivel mechanisms - which is convenient if you need to reach the farthest part of the window or the surface has a rounded configuration.

===Techniques===
The &quot;swivel method&quot;, or &quot;fan method&quot; as it is referred to by professionals, uses a series of strokes combined with turns that hold the water away from the leading edge of the squeegee; when the turn is completed in the opposing direction, there is no water and no dirt left isolated. Straight strokes, either horizontally or vertically, are normally much more efficient than “fanning” when using fixed handle squeegees; however, this method leads to more streaks and missed spots. If a few spots are missed, a chamois leather cloth works better for touch up than a towel of cloth or paper.

In 1992, Willie Erken invented the pivoting handle squeegee.

Using a squeegee for window cleaning may sometimes produce run lines. These are caused by cleaning fluid being pushed up into the top edge of the window, or by fluid flowing from under the rubber blade into the dry area of the glass. The latter of these cases may be prevented by holding the squeegee at a slight angle relative to the direction in which it is being moved, directing fluid flow towards the wet area of the glass.

Worn-out squeegee rubbers and damaged equipment will negatively affect cleaning results.

Another method used by window cleaners is to tap the blade on an already wet area of the glass to remove any excess water on the rubber blade. Alternatively the rubber blade can be dried with a towel, although this method is slower and not practical when using extension poles.

According to Guinness World Records, the world&#x27;s fastest window cleaner is Terry Burrows of South Ockendon, Essex, England, who cleaned three standard office windows set in a frame in 9.24 seconds at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham in March 2005. He used a squeegee and of water.

==Floor cleaning==
The floor squeegee is similar to the window squeegee but has a long handle like a push broom, used to clean floors after they have been sprayed with water or soap, to push the water into drains.

This is often used in places that need the floors cleaned regularly, such as army barracks or the meat departments in supermarkets. Hospitals sometimes use the floor squeegee to clean up any spills that occur in operating rooms or regular patient rooms, as the design of the squeegee lends itself towards a more sanitary cleanup.

===Decks of ships===
The earliest quotations mentioning squeegees in the Oxford English Dictionary refer to their use in cleaning decks on board ship: in 1844 a &quot;squee gee&quot; in an American book, in 1851 a &quot;leathern squilgee&quot; in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and in 1867 in a British book by Admiral William Henry Smyth. Additionally, Richard Henry Dana&#x27;s 1840 memoir &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; mentions “squilgeeing” in Chapter XIV.

The following are considered correct English terminologies, according to the [Canadian] Naval Terminology Standardization Committee:

* squeegee;
* deck squeegee;
* squilgee; and
* squillagee.

== Street cleaning ==

Squeegees on broom handles were used for street cleaning in the later nineteenth century. This was the case in London by 1873. In the early twentieth century some cities in Europe and North America used horse-drawn machinery with rotating rubber squeegee blades on rollers behind a water tank connected to sprinklers. In 1911, this was described as &quot;a German invention which has been for some years in successful operation in leading German cities&quot;. A US version of the rotating squeegee machine, known as the Kindling Squeegee or Kindling Street Washing Machine, was in use by the time of that description. It was manufactured in Milwaukee by Louis Kindling who had migrated from Germany to Wisconsin in 1873. 

By 1915, some streets in Paris, Washington DC, and Philadelphia were being cleaned by this kind of machine, while London still depended on men with hand brooms and squeegees. In 1919, Kindling got a US patent for a design with &quot;new and useful Improvements in Squeegee-Rollers&quot;, following another &quot;improvements&quot; patent for squeegee street cleaning machines filed in 1915 by the inventor and civil engineer Samuel Whinery (1845–1925) (resident of East Orange, New Jersey) and published in 1916.

In 1914, William H. Connell (Chief, Bureau of Highways and Street Cleaning in Philadelphia) explained that the street cleaning was done in batteries of &quot;two and three squeegee machines preceded by sprinklers&quot; reportedly about ahead. The American Highway Engineers&#x27; Handbook of 1919 reveals that this method was used in order for the water:

The need for supporting labour and foot was seen as a disadvantage. Furthermore, the squeegee machines were pulled by horses, which would defecate on the streets which were attempted to be cleansed. Therefore, they were gradually replaced by mechanical street cleaning devices, which were introduced as early as 1911.

==Printing and photography==

In screen printing, a squeegee is used to spread ink evenly across the back of a stencil or silkscreen, making a clean image on the printed surface. Screen-printing squeegees usually have much thicker and less flexible blades than the window cleaning variety.

A squeegee is also used in photography printing to dry the photographic paper after it is washed, preventing wrinkles or water spots. Photographic squeegees usually have thicker and more rigid blades than standard squeegees, to allow the photographer to apply more pressure and squeeze water out of the paper&#x27;s fibers. A pair of squeegees mounted like tongs may also be used on photographic film to accelerate drying.

The earliest reference to a squeegee used for drying in photography is an 1878 description by chemist and photographer William Abney of squeezing excess water away. His squeegee had no handle, and was &quot;a flat bar of wood, into which is let a piece of india-rubber about 1/2 centimetre thick and 2 centimetres broad&quot;. The user should note that &quot;the india-rubber of the squeegee must be brought to bear with considerable pressure on to the surface of the paper, and the strokes made with it should commence from the centre and finish towards the ends&quot;.

==Sports==
The ice on skating rinks is resurfaced using a squeegee and other tools. Nowadays, they are all integrated in an ice resurfacer machine.

Tennis courts sometimes have squeegees to help keep them dry and control the flow of water.

==Other uses==
Stiff-bladed squeegees are used in addition to margin trowels and grout floats to apply grout or adhesive when applying ceramic tiles to a surface.

Squeegees with hard rubber or metal blades are used in stencil printing to apply solder paste to printed circuit boards (PCBs).

Small, hand-held plastic and rubber wedges with an edge formed as a blade are used in signwriting for the application of vinyl sheeting to decrease the possibility of air pockets. Signwriters&#x27; squeegees come in different models, some of which do not have handles, but are approximately the size and shape of a credit card.

Automobile squeegees are used in some universities to clean chalkboards.

During the September 11 attacks in 2001, Polish window washer Jan Demczur used a squeegee to free himself and five others from an elevator shaft in the World Trade Center in New York City. The squeegee is now currently on display at the Smithsonian.

===In popular media===
* The idea of a squeegee has been used by Associate Professor Burkard Polster of Monash University, to illustrate the mathematical Kakeya needle problem.
* It is claimed that comedian Bill Hicks used the phrase &quot;Squeegee Your Third Eye&quot; frequently in his acts.
* The &quot;Squeegee Weegee Gazette&quot; is the official periodical of the Sausalito Yacht Club.
* &quot;Weegee&quot; is the pseudonym of the photographer Arthur (Usher) Fellig. One possible origin of his pseudonym is that it refers to his skills as a darkroom assistant (such an assistant is sometimes called &quot;squeegee boy&quot;).

<doc id="704500" wikidata="Q7054466" url="?curid=704500" title="Councils of governments in North Carolina">
<text>The North Carolina Councils of Government (or the Regional Councils of Government) are voluntary associations of county and municipal governments, established by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1972 that serve as an avenue for local governments across North Carolina to discuss issues that are particular to their region. In banding together at the regional level, the voice of one community becomes the voice of many, thus providing a better opportunity for those issues to be addressed. The majority of citizens and local governments in North Carolina are represented by regional councils, making them an increasingly important facet of local government operations.

== History ==
Regional councils benefit leaders in the community both elected and not, as well as the citizenry, in the way that these councils foster regional economic competitiveness. Regional councils work to address the many issues that communities are facing today, often these issues are those that are critical to a community&#x27;s overall well being including transportation, air quality and water quality.

Addressing regional issues such as the aforementioned, can be a difficult task. For this reason collaboration among the public, civic, nonprofit and private sectors in various types of regional organizations has remained extremely appealing for those communities wishing to remain competitive at the regional level.

Typically a region can contain several different kinds of regional organizations. One of which is the regional council of government. A regional council of government is a broad based, voluntary public organization that aids local member governments through a variety of services, through its role as a regional forum, and through a comprehensive work program. Many early regional councils evolved from the private, nonprofit regional planning organizations of the 1920s, and even more were formed in the years following World War II.

Federal legislation passed in the mid-1960s and early 1970s laid the groundwork for the formation of most regional councils. This legislation was inclusive of federal programs for comprehensive planning as well as intergovernmental cooperation. By 1977 it was estimated that the Federal government was providing approximately 75% of regional council budgets. This figure however, dropped dramatically by 1988 as federal funding was cut sharply, and it is estimated to have accounted for only 45% of regional council budgets at this time.

As of 1998 the National Association of Regional Councils directory lists 501 councils in 48 states. This is a decrease of nearly 20% from 1976, which in part is due to regional councils absorbing sub-regional councils or combining with councils in adjoining regions. Of these 501 regional councils, it is reported that: 322 are designated as economic development districts, 304 serve as review agencies for applications for state or federal funding, 245 conduct land use planning, 277 allocate federal and state revolving loan funds for wastewater and drinking water facilities, 181 conduct regional transportation planning as MPO&#x27;s (Metropolitan Planning Organizations) and 163 provide services for the elderly.

== Regional councils in North Carolina ==
In 1995 there were 18 regional councils of government in North Carolina. In the years following, this number decreased to 17 and today North Carolina calls itself home to 16 regional councils of government. Regional councils in North Carolina are committed to working together. In 2010 the seventeen regional councils existing at that time signed an inter-regional cooperative agreement that established a policy to enhance their value by sharing member resources and capacity to deliver services to the state of North Carolina. This agreement also endorses regional councils, to carry out activities in regions outside their boundaries with consent when those services are to benefit the region and the state. Regional boundaries correspond to county borders, with each council being made up of both county and municipal governments. Although the number of regional councils in North Carolina has decreased over the years, the number of citizens served by the councils continues to rise. The reduction of regional councils in North Carolina is a trend that appears to mirror that on the national level, which decreased 20% between 1976 and 1988, due in large part to regional councils combining with one another and absorbing smaller sub regional councils. As of July 1, 2007 it is reported that the number of local governments served by regional councils in North Carolina has increased by 16% since 1994. Throughout this same time period the number of citizens served by regional councils has increased by 35% or approximately 2.3 million. This equates to 92% of local governments and 97% of all North Carolina citizens being represented by regional councils as of July 1, 2007.

== Services provided by regional councils ==
Regional councils of government, or COGs for short, provide many services for their members. Planning, technical assistance, geographic information systems (GIS), and grant writing are the four most prevalent in the State of North Carolina. Much like the increase in representation from 1994 to 2007, the number of services provided by COGs has increased as well. In 1995 it was reported that only 7 of 18 COGs in existence at the time provided all four of the aforementioned services. In 2008, the number of COGs providing all four of the services increased to 17 out of 17 or 100%. Today it is reported that all regional councils in North Carolina administer the federal and state aging programs in cooperation with the NC department for aging. Aside from aging, regional councils in North Carolina provide numerous other federal and state programs. They administer transportation planning, CDBG grants, HUD grants, data collection, housing programs and more. These programs are made possible through partnerships between North Carolina regional councils and federal and state agencies including United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Economic Development Administration, United States Environmental Protection Agency, NC Departments of Commerce, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DENR), United States Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina Department of Transportation and the North Carolina Rural Center.

The top four services that were cited as being most important to local governments as of 2007 were as follows in order: (1) Economic Development and Planning, (2) Grant Writing and Administration, (3) Transportation Planning and (4) Regional water resources planning. Within the next 5–10 years however, these priorities are expected to change. The top four services that were cited as being most important to local governments over the next 5–10 years are as follows in order: (1) Regional water resources planning, (2)Transportation Planning, (3)Community and Economic Development Planning and (4) Grant Writing and Administration.

== Regional council budgets ==
Although representation and number of services provided by COGs has increased over the years, the budgets of these councils have not followed suit. In general, total budgets have increased, but per capita budgets have decreased substantially between the years of 1994 and 2007. This is due to the fact that the population of North Carolina has increased at a faster rate than the COG budgets.

Depending on geographical size, population and number of services provided, the budgets of regional councils in North Carolina vary greatly. In 2007 Region R or the counties of: Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hyde, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell and Washington had the smallest budget of all regional councils in the state at approximately $4.4 million. Region I or the counties of: Davie, Forsyth, Stokes, Surry and Yadkin had the largest budget of all regional councils at approximately $15.2 million. Between 1994 and 2007, the average total budget for North Carolina COG&#x27;s increased 11% from $8 million to $8.9 million. Direct State Contribution to regional councils of government decreased by 27% during this same time period (1994–2007) in which the average total budget increase was realized. From 1994-2007 North Carolina saw a population increase of 26%. This increase in population, coupled with the substantial decrease in state contribution, led to an average per capita budget decrease in regional councils of 39% or from $42 to $26 during this time period.

Regional Councils receive the bulk of their funds from federal and state sources. In 1994, it was reported that approximately 92% ($95 million) of $103 million received by regional councils was from State and Federal funding. Approximately 84% of these State and Federal funds were passed through to local governments or other agencies to provide services for target populations such as those needing housing assistance or the elderly. The remaining 7% or approximately $8 million in revenues received by regional councils came from local funding.

== State enabling statutes ==
NCGS 160A-470 enables regional councils of government to be established in North Carolina. Furthermore, this statute lays the groundwork for the formation of regional councils of government in North Carolina, and extends an open invitation for participation to governments in adjoining states. The statute reads as follows: NCGS 160A-470 &quot;(a) Any two or more units of local government may create a regional council of governments by adopting identical concurrent resolutions to that effect in accordance with the provisions and procedures of this Part. To the extent permitted by the laws of its state, a local government in a state adjoining North Carolina may participate in regional councils of governments organized under this Part to the same extent as if it were located in this State. The concurrent resolutions creating a regional council of governments and any amendments thereto, will be referred to in this Part as the &quot;charter&quot; of the regional council&quot;.

NCGS 160-475 goes on to specifically list the powers that the charter confers upon regional councils. The powers as contained in this statute are as follows: 
*&quot;(1) To apply for, accept, receive, and dispense funds and grants made available to it by the State of North Carolina or any agency thereof, the United States of America or any agency thereof, any unit of local government (whether or not a member of the council), and any private or civic agency. 
*(2) To employ personnel 
*(3) To contract with consultants 
*(4) To contract with the State of North Carolina, any other state, the United States of America, or any agency thereof for services 
*(5) To study regional governmental problems, including matters affecting health, safety, welfare, education, recreation, economic conditions, regional planning and regional development 
*(6) To promote cooperative arrangements and coordinated action among its member governments 
*(7) To make recommendations for review and action to its member governments and other public agencies which perform functions within the region in which its member governments are located (7a) For the purpose of meeting the regional council&#x27;s office space and program needs, to acquire real property by purchase, gift or otherwise to improve that property. The regional council may pledge real property as security for indebtedness used to finance acquisition of that property or for improvements to that real property, subject to approval by the Local Government Commission as required under G.S. 159-153. A regional council may not exercise the power of eminent domain. 
*(8) Any other powers that are exercised or capable of exercise by its member governments and desirable for dealing with problems of mutual concern to the extent such powers are specifically delegated to it from time to time by resolution of the governing board of each of its member governments which are affected thereby, provided that no regional council of governments shall have the authority to construct or purchase building, or acquire title to real property, except for the purposes permitted under subdivision (7a) of this section in order to exercise the authority granted by Chapter 260 of the Session Laws of 1979.&quot;

==Camps==

===Camp Edward===

Camp Edward, previously known as Camp Brinkley, is a camp in Snohomish, Washington. It was founded in 1967 and originally held a resident summer camp program for Boy Scouts, but has since transitioned to a summer camp program for Cub Scouts.

===Camp Pigott===

Camp Pigott, (named after former Paccar CEO and philanthropist Charles M. Pigott), has run a resident summer camp program since its re-opening in 2003. It had formerly been named Camp Omache, and had been closed since 1991.

Camp Pigott sits on Lake Hughes in Snohomish, Washington. It features a 35&#x27; high-ropes course known as the C.O.P.E. course. The course is a non-linear design so Scouts can choose a variety of challenges and pathways. The camp also includes a 42&#x27; covered climbing tower with three climbing surfaces (including a real rock surface and overhang) and one, two-lane rappelling surface. Camp Pigott also has a mountain biking course and a blacksmith shop. The camp has a dining hall that is equipped with a full size industrial kitchen, and indoor/outdoor fireplace for the main hall.

Camp Pigott is home of the Order of the Arrow T&#x27;Kope Kwiskwis Lodge&#x27;s ceremonial longhouse.

===Camp Sheppard===

Camp Sheppard is a camp outside of Enumclaw, Washington. Sheppard does not run a resident Scout camping program, but does run several other Scout programs including a Winter Camp program for Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. Since 2011, Sheppard has been the location for the Council&#x27;s National Youth Leadership Training, usually holding four sessions every year in the summer.

Until 2009, Camp Sheppard was a High Adventure base, where it offered programs in mountaineering, mountain biking, and backpacking.

Until 2014, it hosted the &quot;Mom &amp; Me/Dad &amp; Me&quot; Cub Scout camping programs, after which they were moved to Camp Edward.

===Camp Parsons===
Founded in 1919, Camp Parsons is the oldest continuous running Boy Scout camp west of the Mississippi River and one of the oldest continually running Boy Scout camps in the United States on its original location. It sits on , part of the Hood Canal, on the Olympic Peninsula, just north of Brinnon, Washington, and just south of Quilcene, Washington. The site of the camp was chosen by Professor Edmund Meany, Major Edward Ingraham and members of the Seattle Area Council. It was purchased from John Strom in May 1919 and named after the first council president, Reginald H. Parsons. Booth Hall (the current Silver Marmot Grill) was constructed in May and June 1919 and continues to be used today. On July 7, 1919, 100 Scouts arrived at Camp Parsons for its first season that ran 6 weeks and has not stopped since. A separate camp for Cub Scouts was developed on the property in 1937 and named Camp Meany in honor of the late Professor Edmund Meany, first Scout commissioner for Seattle. This camp was merged into Camp Parsons in 1941 and that camp&#x27;s dining hall served as the dining hall for Camp Parsons until the summer 2014 after which it was razed and a new dining hall was constructed and dedicated in June 2015.

Thousands of Scouts from the Pacific Northwest and throughout the United States and Canada attend camp each summer. Camp Parsons is the only Boy Scout Camp that uses a salt water beach for all aquatic activities. Camp Parsons also has hiking treks for Scouts to explore the Olympic Mountains and Kayak treks to explore the Hood Canal.

==Order of the Arrow==
Chief Seattle Council&#x27;s local lodge in the Order of the Arrow is T&#x27;kope Kwiskwis, founded in 1954. The name translates to &#x27;[The Order of] the Silver Marmot&#x27; and refers to the council&#x27;s original honor society that originated at Camp Parsons, the Silver Marmot. Unlike other lodges around the United States, which wear the Plains Indian style of regalia for their ceremonies, T&#x27;Kope, along with neighboring lodges wears button blankets.

In April 2013, T&#x27;Kope Kwiskwis completed the reconstruction of a ceremonial longhouse at Camp Pigott that is used for Order of the Arrow ceremonies.

The T&#x27;Kope Kwiskwis lodge won the 2012 OA National Service Award.

<text>Robert Crosbie (10 January 1849 – 25 June 1919) was a theosophist and founder of the United Lodge of Theosophists (ULT).

Crosbie was born in Montreal, Lower Canada. In 1902, he moved to Lomaland, Point Loma, California where he helped in building a theosophical community. In 1908 he published a letter &quot;To all open-minded Theosophists&quot; about his thoughts on the Theosophical Society. In February 1909 he founded the ULT in Los Angeles. The organization had no presidents or hierarchical structures. Emphasizing the universality of theosophy, the Declaration of the United Lodge of Theosophists states in part:

&quot;It regards as Theosophists all who are engaged in the true service of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, condition or organization,(...)&quot; 

Much of the wording of the ULT Declaration is directly derived from statements found in the writings of William Q. Judge and H.P. Blavatsky. The expressed mission statement of the United Lodge of Theosophists is “To spread broadcast the original teachings of Theosophy as recorded in the writings of H.P. Blavatsky and William Q. Judge.”

In 1912 Crosbie first published the theosophical magazine &quot;Theosophy&quot;. He also founded Theosophy School. In 1916 two new lodges of the ULT were opened in San Francisco and Berkeley, California. The ULT exists to this day, as an international association with lodges and study groups presently in 16 nations around the world.

Crosbie died in 1919 in Monterey, California.

<text>Captain Sir Alexander Holburn, 3rd Baronet (c. 1728 – January 22, 1772) (alternatively Holborne or Holburne) was a Scottish sea captain in the Royal Navy. He was the second son of the advocate Sir James Holburn, 2nd Baronet (grandson of Major General James Holborne of Menstrie) by his second wife Jean, the daughter of Alexander Spital of Leuchat. Alexander succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1758 when he was killed at sea in 1756.

==Naval career==
Admiral Saunders, upon leaving the Mediterranean in 1757, took with him his chaplain, his flag captain Alexander Hood, and all six of his lieutenants, among whom was Alexander Holburn. Holburn was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1763.

==Imprisonment==
Before he could take command of his ship, Holburn was imprisoned for debt at the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, Southwark, where he remained until shortly before his death. His wife, Maria Holburn, approached the Duke of Portland in 1766, in the hope of securing for Alexander a position. Holburn died childless, and the baronetcy passed to his cousin, Francis Holburn, 4th Baronet, son of Admiral Francis Holburn.

<text>New Turkey Party or abbreviated as NTP, (, YTP) was a social democratic political party in Turkey. It was founded in 2002 following a leadership crisis in the Democratic Left Party (, DSP) that was the major partner in a three party coalition government.

== History ==
The health condition of elder statesman Bülent Ecevit, the Prime Minister and leader of the party led to rumours that his Deputy Prime minister and Minister of State, Hüsamettin Özkan, was plotting to replace him. As a result, Özkan was forced to resign, nearly half of DSP&#x27;s parliamentarians followed him including İsmail Cem, the Minister of Foreign affairs. Özkan, Zeki Eker, Cem and Kemal Derviş, the Minister of State in charge of economy, then decided to establish a new social democratic party. İsmail Cem became the leader of the party.

The new party was received warmly by the public opinion. Most of the electorate was critical of the government because of the economic crises in 2000 and 2001, as well as the poor health of Ecevit. 

However, things started to look bad for NTP as the party showed signs of organizational weakness. Moreover, Derviş changed his mind and joined the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) instead. As a result, the YTP performed dismally in the 2002 general election (receiving only 1.2% of the eligible votes cast) and again in the 2004 local elections.

In October 2004, the YTP was merged into the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP).

<text>Opus was a Sunday strip drawn by Berkeley Breathed from November 23, 2003, to November 2, 2008. It was Breathed&#x27;s fourth comic strip, following &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;, &quot;Bloom County&quot; and &quot;Outland&quot;.

Set in Bloom County, the satirical strip featured Breathed&#x27;s character Opus the Penguin. It was launched on November 23, 2003, and was syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group. In early October 2008, the author declared he was terminating the strip because of his expectation that the United States was going to face tough times and his desire to depart from his most famous character &quot;on a lighter note&quot;. 

==Characters==

===Opus===
Opus is the title character and protagonist of the strip. Though he returned to Antarctica at the end of &quot;Outland&quot;, Opus traveled back home to Bloom County, only to find that time has changed everything and everyone he once held dear. His employment usually depended on the week&#x27;s joke – since &quot;Opus&quot; began, he has so far been a political operative, a garbageman, and a newspaper ombudsman – but he was most often depicted as a syndicated cartoonist.

While his mother, maiden name Bougm, was no longer &quot;long-lost,&quot; she was not all he had imagined her to be after a decades-long search, and he was frequently seeking the comfort of an ideal mother-figure.

In a 2003 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Breathed revealed that &quot;Opus was named after a Kansas song.&quot; (The band&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Leftoverture&quot; includes the song &quot;Opus Insert&quot; and a suite called &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;.) He also added, &quot;If you&#x27;re too young to know who Kansas was, to hell with you.&quot;

===Regular characters===
* Bill the Cat – the first of Opus&#x27; old friends to re-emerge (just months into the strip), Bill seemed to be the only one completely unchanged by time. Still in a state of catatonia, he was occasionally tapped to run for political office but most often seen relaxing by Opus&#x27; side. He did not appear in many strips through the summer and fall of 2008, though.
* Steve Dallas – Steve was reintroduced little more than a year in, making him the only character to have appeared in a major role in all four of Breathed&#x27;s comic strips. Steve, who had come out as gay at the end of &quot;Outland&quot;, was back to his former chauvinistic ways, apparently as a result of so-called &quot;reparative therapy&quot; (i.e., conversion therapy). Steve&#x27;s lack of ability to charm women, however, remained. He had aged quite noticeably and appeared to be in his mid 50s, with graying temples and a receding hairline, but still retained his trademark sunglasses.
* Pickles – A little girl with a little bit of &quot;snarky energy&quot; (she first appeared as a self-proclaimed Viking princess), Pickles immediately began tagging along with Opus and Bill. She appeared much less frequently towards the end of the strip&#x27;s run.
* Auggie Dallas – Steve&#x27;s long lost son, reunited with his father after many years. He had nothing but admiration for Steve, even though Steve was sometimes reluctant to act like a father figure. His name may be a reference to Augie Doggie.
* Michael Binkley – A longtime friend of Opus who began appearing in the strip after a somewhat unexplained twelve-year absence (see below). He appeared as he did in Bloom County, inexplicably not aging as Steve Dallas had.

===Other characters===
* Senator Bedfellow – Though previously convicted on corruption charges, Bedfellow returned later on, still usually drunk and plagued by reporters.
* Editor of the &quot;Bloom Picayune&quot; – Usually Opus&#x27; boss, the &quot;Picayune&quot;&#x27;s editor was depicted as hyper-stressed and suicidal, though somewhat older than he was in &quot;Bloom County&quot;.
* Oliver Wendell Jones – For some reason, Oliver was shown, like Binkley, to be the same age as he had been in &quot;Bloom County&quot; and &quot;Outland&quot;. He reappeared on August 5, 2007.
* Lola Granola – Opus&#x27; one-time fiancée (back in the days of &quot;Bloom County&quot;), Lola reappeared on August 12, 2007 as Steve&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Berkeley Breathed – On November 25, 2007, the cartoonist appeared as himself (using a likeness of Sean Connery as James Bond instead of drawing his own face) and &quot;announced&quot; that Jim Davis&#x27;s character Garfield is gay in a parody of author J. K. Rowling&#x27;s ex post facto outing of the Harry Potter character Albus Dumbledore. The strip ended with Breathed calling Rowling a &quot;lily-livered literary chicken&quot;.

===Absent characters===
Early on in the strip, it was revealed that Michael Binkley had fled Bloom County to become a teenage Tibetan eunuch after a disastrous first kiss (this kiss was described to Binkley by his older self from his anxiety closet in Bloom County). He was not heard from again until June 3, 2007, when he appeared in his child form without explanation.

At an autograph party for an &quot;Opus&quot; anthology book, Breathed revealed that the reason many of the original child characters had not returned is because in the years since the end of &quot;Outland&quot;, the child characters would have aged into teenagers, and Breathed had no interest in reviving the characters in that form.

==&quot;Death&quot;==
On August 31, 2008, &quot;the Creator&quot; (Berkeley Breathed) spoke to Opus and hinted that the strip will end soon. The next week, Opus was visited by the ghost of Elvis who told Opus to find a place where he wants to be forever, because he will stay in that one spot after he &quot;dies.&quot; e.g., Elvis is condemned to sit on the toilet forever because that&#x27;s where he happened to be when he died.

Opus tried to fly to a tropical island on September 14, but when he was asked for his passport, he told the ticket clerk that he smuggled himself into the U.S. 30 years ago. He was promptly arrested by airport security while screaming, &quot;God Bless George Bush!&quot; Opus was taken to the Department of Homeland Security and waterboarded. The guards told him to &quot;start talking, Akbar!&quot; Opus complained to &quot;the Creator,&quot; saying he couldn&#x27;t just let the strip end like this. &quot;The Creator&quot; then placed Opus in an animal shelter, and mockingly said, &quot;Happy?&quot; to which Opus replied &quot;NO!!&quot;

The next week, September 26, 2008, saw Opus bemoaning having to spend his eternity in a county animal shelter. At the behest of a fellow inmate, a scruffy dog, Opus soon began sharing his memories of his past and recounts his life through the run of Breathed&#x27;s strips. Many shots of him in well-known stories from &quot;Bloom County&quot; are then shown, including Opus saying &quot;bozo&quot; to a politician on the TV in 1981, misunderstanding a money-grubbing cultist in 1982, sharing a mass dandelion break with other characters in 1983, his role in the rock band &quot;Deathtöngue&quot; in 1984, dreaming romantically of Diane Sawyer in 1985, and a current joke about Sarah Palin set in 1986. The strip included a tag at the bottom indicating it would be continued the next week.

At this point, a trio of island-native girls arrive at the shelter; they only have room for one companion to live with them in their paradise.

On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced that the strip would end after November 2 that year, and even decided to do a contest for people to guess what Opus&#x27;s fate is on BerkeleyBreathed.com. The winner will have $10,000 donated to the animal shelter of their choosing.

On October 19, 2008, Steve Dallas was shown barging into the Bloom County Animal Shelter&#x27;s lobby demanding to see Opus, claiming Opus owed him $20. The clerk stationed there informed Steve that Opus had chosen his final eternity and that Steve should do so likewise, and very quickly. The conversation ended with Steve finally realizing he was in a cartoon strip by breaking the fourth wall and asking the clerk who &quot;all those scruffy-looking people [are]&quot; as he looked at the readers, to which the clerk replied, &quot;Probably Democrats at this point,&quot; since he did this after dropping his towel, standing naked (but with a censor bar over his groin).

The next week, Steve found the tropical island girls and told them to give back Opus. It was then revealed that Opus had let his doggy companion in the shelter go with the girls, said &quot;goodnight&quot;, and returned to the kennel. After seeing a vision of former &quot;Bloom County&quot; residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John&#x27;s wheelchair, Steve walked back to the animal shelter to find nothing but Opus&#x27; bow tie and an empty kennel. The final strip showed a glowing light coming from a box inside the kennel. Steve reaches into the box, and smiles at what he sees. The panel showed the address of a link to the Humane Society, which displayed the last panel as part of the $10,000 contest (it would later be printed in &quot; Berkeley Breathed&#x27;s Opus: The Complete Library&quot;). The final strip showed Steve opening a copy of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; and seeing Opus tucked in bed, sleeping peacefully with a mother rabbit watching over him.

The 2015 revival of the &quot;Bloom County&quot; comic strip reveals that Opus is still alive, only that he has been unconscious the past 25 years and that the events of &quot;Opus&quot; and &quot;Outland&quot; were all an elaborate dream sequence.

==Production history==
In numerous interviews before launching &quot;Opus&quot;, Berke Breathed stated his hopes that the strip would help reinvigorate the medium of newspaper comics. He criticized many modern strips, especially &quot;Garfield&quot;, for lacking expressive artwork or original humor.

In an interview appearing in the April 2007 issue of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, Breathed announced that he planned to end the strip by killing off the main character. On April 2, 2007 the journal &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; reported on this interview in a story titled &quot;Will Cartoonist Berkeley Breathed Kill Off Opus the Penguin?&quot; However, Breathed&#x27;s editor has reportedly quoted him as stating, &quot;I mentioned Opus&#x27; literal death just for talking points on my [book] tour coming up. Not gonna kill him, but it&#x27;s good for copy.&quot; Breathed confirmed that he was joking in an interview with Salon: &quot;I was kidding about killing Opus, by the way. I&#x27;d like to walk the streets free from fears of spontaneous garroting.&quot;

In August 2008, the strip began a sequence playing off the 2007 interview, as &quot;the Creator&quot; of the strip informed Opus that &quot;the end is near.&quot; The strip ended on Sunday, November 2, 2008, with Opus snugly in bed at the conclusion of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;.

==Artwork and availability==
The original syndication contract for &quot;Opus&quot; stipulated that the strip occupy an entire half of a newspaper page. According to The Washington Post Writers Group, this was to provide &quot;space for Breathed to offer richness and depth, similar to the breathtaking imagery in his popular children&#x27;s books.&quot; While this style can appear hand-painted or airbrushed, it is actually rendered by Breathed on a computer using Adobe Photoshop. The half-page requirement was subsequently lifted, and the strip scaled down by most newspapers. Its original illustration style has also been largely abandoned in favor of a more hand-drawn look, much like that of Breathed&#x27;s previous strip, &quot;Outland&quot;.

Initially, in an effort to help boost physical newspaper sales, the strip was barred from appearing online; however, in 2005, that too changed and &quot;Opus&quot; became officially available on the web.

On August 26, 2007, the strip featured Lola Granola wearing a headscarf, explaining that she was now a &quot;radical Islamist.&quot; The cartoon was not printed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and many other papers. The following week&#x27;s strip was also censored. Both strips were replaced by more innocuous strips in the printed versions, but the &#x27;objectionable&#x27; strips relating to Lola&#x27;s religious beliefs were offered in a variety of Internet comics sites, including Breathed&#x27;s homepage and the &quot;My Comics Page&quot; site. This site now requires a paid &quot;pro&quot; registration for access to the censored strips, but free access to the censored strips is still available online.

==Unreleased film==
In August 2006 The Weinstein Company revealed in a press release for an animated version of &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; that it had a &quot;CG-animated project&quot; called &quot;Opus&quot; &quot;in the works&quot;. Numerous online movie databases, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, have entries for the movie, titled &quot;Opus: The Last Christmas&quot;, and give a release date of December 19, 2008. Some of these sites name Berkeley Breathed as the director, while others list Tim Bjorklund and Paul Taylor. Initially, Miramax Films was reported to have obtained the movie rights to the series, but the project migrated to The Weinstein Company with the departure of the Weinstein brothers from Disney and Miramax.

However, on May 8, 2007, during an interview by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of &quot;Opus: The Last Christmas&quot; by saying,

In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was &quot;dead&quot;, but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film:

<doc id="704528" wikidata="Q1991026" url="?curid=704528" title="Elizabeth Clare Prophet">
<text>Elizabeth Clare Prophet (&quot;née&quot;: Wulf, a.k.a. Guru Ma) (April 8, 1939 – October 15, 2009) was an American spiritual leader, author, orator, and writer. In 1963 she married Mark L. Prophet (after ending her first marriage), who had founded The Summit Lighthouse in 1958. Mark and Elizabeth had four children. Elizabeth, after her second husband&#x27;s death on February 26, 1973, assumed control of The Summit Lighthouse. 

In 1975, Prophet founded Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT), which became the umbrella organization for the movement, which she expanded worldwide, and which has been described, including by Prophet, as &quot;New Age&quot;. She also founded Summit University and Summit University Press. In the late 1980s Prophet controversially called on her members to prepare for the possibility of nuclear war at the turn of the decade, encouraging them to construct fallout shelters. The failure of prediction was a setback for the church, resulting in a loss of membership. In 1996, Prophet handed day-to-day operational control of her organization to a president and board of directors. She maintained her role as spiritual leader until her retirement for health reasons in 1999. As of the 2020s, videos of her sermons play an important part of the church&#x27;s religious work.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Prophet appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Donahue&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot;, among other television programs. Earlier media appearances included a feature in 1977 in &quot;The Man Who Would Not Die&quot;, an episode of &quot;In Search of...&quot; She was also featured in 1994 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Prophecies&quot;.

==Early years==
Elizabeth Clare Prophet was born Elizabeth Clare Wulf at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey on April 8, 1939, the only child of a German immigrant, Hans Wulf, and his Swiss wife, Fridy. She grew up with her family in Red Bank, New Jersey during the Second World War. She describes her earliest childhood as idyllic, yet also chaotic and unpredictable. In 1942, when she was two years old, her father was detained on suspicion of being a German spy. In her autobiography she writes that upon his release he inspired her to help others who may also suffer because of their nationality, race, or religion, and that the Holocaust convinced her of the reality of absolute evil in the world. This played a main role in her deciding to major in political science in her studies.

She also writes of her father&#x27;s addiction to alcohol, his verbal abuse of her mother and violent temper which he directed towards them and the destruction of his beloved fish tanks. Prophet came to believe that when the blood alcohol content creates a chemical imbalance in the body, possessing demons take over the mind and the emotions.

In her early life, she periodically blacked out. This happened in the third grade, when she was about to say her lines in a Christmas play, and recurred throughout her life. This was first diagnosed as petit mal epilepsy, known more commonly today as absence seizures, although she believed it was a way of escaping her father’s alcoholic rages. She did not find medication helpful, and discontinued using it. Her mother later confessed that in 1937 she took some pills in an unsuccessful attempt to abort her pregnancy with Elizabeth. Prophet thought her mother was implying the medication may have contributed to her childhood blackouts. Prophet herself did some research, and believed the use of quinine sulphate could have damaged the developing nervous system and the brain.

Elizabeth Wulf claimed mystical experiences while growing up. She claimed that when she was about four, she had a vision of herself playing on the sands of the Nile river in Egypt. (Her mother told her that it was a past life.) She claimed that as a child she felt God&#x27;s light around her naturally, and heard a sound in her inner ear like that of an ocean wave or the roar of Niagara Falls. While water-skiing, she said she felt she was suspended in a place where other spiritual beings existed, who were joyous in the light, radiating love. This motivated her to find out more about who these &quot;saints robed in white&quot; (Rev. 7:9-17) were, for she had always believed in the &quot;universality of all true religion&quot;.

==Influences==
Wulf grew up in a home that was mainly non-religious except for major holidays. (The New York Times describes her as being a Christian Scientist as a child.) Her father was Lutheran, her mother nominally Catholic. Yet it was her mother&#x27;s interests in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on her. In Theosophy and the I AM Activity she heard about the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God was our true nature. Prophet stayed with Christian Science until she met Mark Prophet at the age of 22.

==Education==
Wulf spent her junior year studying French in Switzerland in 1956, and a year later graduated from Red Bank Regional High School ranked second in her class. She attended Antioch College in Ohio from September 1957 to March 1959 majoring in political science and economics. She transferred to Boston University in September 1959, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in August 1961.

==Career==
In the summer of 1958, Wulf took a co-op job as a camp counselor in a French immersion school in Vermont. She was in charge of a number of high school girls between 15 and 16 years old and her role was to discipline them. She described the experience as frustrating and said she ended up praying to God she might never be put in a position of authority over others.

In late 1958 she served an internship at the United Nations as secretary for Leo Rosenthal, a UN photographer. She claimed that her experience at the UN showed her that many of the ambassadors were not there to solve the world&#x27;s problems and rather were engaged in power politics and manipulation of the world&#x27;s economies. When she left after three months, she was depressed, and held the opinion that, to solve the world&#x27;s problems people would need to change their concept of themselves and God.

After moving to Boston in 1959, she worked as a secretary for the Christian Science church and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. According to Prophet that is where she learned much about the publishing operations, organization, and administration of a church on a worldwide scale. This would help her later in running her own church.

Wulf claimed she had realized she was intended to be a messenger while meditating with Mark L. Prophet at a public meeting in Boston on April 22, 1961. He had come to teach what he called &quot;the Ascended Masters&quot;. She later claimed to have received a vision, while meditating with him, that her role in life was to pass on a higher teaching to further humanity&#x27;s spiritual evolution. She confided to Mark the next day she was also to be a messenger like him. He accepted her as a student at his mystical school, The Summit Lighthouse. She said she received another vision in June of that year by way of a visitation by the Ascended Master, El Morya, who told her to go to Washington, D.C. to be trained as messenger.

After she attended her first conference in Washington in July, Mark Prophet returned to Boston in August to help her move to Washington to begin her training under him. After her first marriage ended in divorce, they married in 1963 and, upon his death on February 26, 1973, Prophet assumed leadership of the organization. In 1981 the Church Universal and Triumphant purchased the Forbes Ranch just outside Yellowstone Park, near Gardiner, Montana. In 1986, Prophet relocated her headquarters to that property.

===Teachings===
The dogma of The Summit Lighthouse included a doctrine called the Path of Personal Christhood, or the way of the soul&#x27;s one-on-one relationship with God through Christ consciousness. Prophet believed she shared the gift of the word, both written and spoken. She claimed to be in constant communion with God.

&quot;The Science of the Spoken Word&quot;, as Elizabeth and Mark taught it, was thought to be a gift of sound combined with meditation, prayer and visualization. They believed that a Divine Gift (The Ascension) of union with God was possible.

====Preparation for nuclear holocaust====
In 1987, Prophet predicted a first strike by the Soviet Union if America did not implement a missile defense program. She began to admonish her followers to move to Montana and build nuclear fallout shelters for the impending nuclear holocaust. Adherents started construction of a what was called the largest bomb shelter in the U.S. at the church compound in Corwin Springs, Montana on land purchased from magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes. Church members not on the staff built private shelters nearby. 

Starting on 15 March 1990, over three days, &quot;hundreds&quot; of followers waited for a nuclear attack in various bomb shelters, communicating with each other by radio. Insiders, however, spread the word that the event might be the real thing. No one knew for sure, and many children believed this could be the end of life as they knew it. When no nuclear bombs exploded the event was compared to another unsuccessful prediction of the end of the world, The Great Disappointment of 1844. 

====Post-disappointment====
Many left the church following this disappointment, but many stayed. The Prophet&#x27;s focus took a gradual turn away from nuclear prepping and toward community outreach. Around this same time, the nearly-completed construction was halted by court order when large amounts of stored diesel fuel leaked and contaminated the area.

As of 2024 the church is headquartered in Montana and has &quot;teaching centers&quot; around the world.

==Final years and death==
Prophet was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in November 1998 and she died on October 15, 2009, in Bozeman, Montana. Her five children—Erin, Moira, Tatiana, Sean and Seth—were all still alive at the time of her death. In 2009, her daughter Erin Prophet published &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Daughter: My Life with Elizabeth Clare Prophet Inside the Church Universal and Triumphant&quot;, and, in 2016, she contributed a chapter to &quot;The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements&quot;. Prophet&#x27;s children have largely stayed away from their mother&#x27;s church. Some are on friendly terms with the group as it is today; others not necessarily. Prophet encouraged all of her children to fill various roles in the organization&#x27;s leadership and spiritual work. At one time, Elizabeth appointed Erin Prophet as her successor but Erin declined this role. Sean Prophet is an avowed atheist, he has renounced all religions, including his mother&#x27;s church. Tatiana Prophet is a conservative blogger on Facebook.

==Legacy==

For many years, around 15,000 hours of recordings of Prophet&#x27;s sermons have been kept in a concrete bunker in Montana for safe keeping. Video footage played on monitors of her &quot;channeling, chanting, lecturing, singing, and prophesying&quot; are part of the church&#x27;s religious service and are said to &quot;composed the bulk of her ministry&quot;.

===Ascended Lady Master Clare===
Those who adhere to the Ascended Master Teachings believe that Elizabeth Clare Prophet made her ascension after her death. (Adherents of Prophet do not refer to her death but to her &quot;ascension&quot;.) She is known by various names which have been given to her by different organizations, including Ascended Lady Master Clare and Ascended Lady Master Clare de Lis.

It is asserted that Lady Master Clare&#x27;s previous incarnations were:
* Martha of Bethany
* Hypatia
* Clare of Assisi
* Catherine of Siena
* Empress Elisabeth of Austria
* One of the daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, the last sovereign of Imperial Russia
===Michael Flynn===
In September 2021, retired General Michael Flynn addressed the &quot;Opening the Heavens 2021&quot; conference, an evangelical Christian event organized by Pastors Hank and Brenda Kunneman of Lord of Hosts Church and One Voice Ministries. The conference was held at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs, Iowa, near Omaha, Nebraska. During his speech, Flynn led the audience in a supposed Christian Nationalist prayer that directly plagiarised a sermon given by Clare Prophet in the early 1980&#x27;s. 

Jim Stewartson created a video comparison of Clare Prophet&#x27;s strident sermon and the militant prayer led by Michael Flynn with Clare Prophet&#x27;s words being restated unknowingly by the conservative Christian audience.

<doc id="704533" wikidata="Q7576124" url="?curid=704533" title="Spencer MacCallum">
<text>Spencer Heath McCallum (December 21, 1931 – December 17, 2020), commonly known as Spencer MacCallum, was an American anthropologist, business consultant and author. He was especially noted for his discovery of the pottery of the town of Mata Ortiz, Chihuahua, Mexico.

==Personal life==
MacCallum graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelors in art history and received a Masters of Arts in social anthropology from the University of Washington. He specialized in studying the life, culture and stateless society of Northwest Coast Indians.

MacCallum was the grandson of Spencer Heath, inventor and dissenter from mainstream Georgism.

==Career==
In 1956, MacCallum and his grandfather founded the Science of Society Foundation, which published a number of works, including Heath&#x27;s book &quot;Citadel, Market and Altar.&quot; MacCallum was for many years an active researcher and lecturer for academic and business clients. He was a Research Fellow at the Independent Institute.

MacCallum shared his grandfather&#x27;s interest in multi-tenant properties where developers lease properties and are responsible for providing community services, thereby replacing the functions traditionally provided by the state. He details these ideas in his 1970 booklet &quot;The Art of Community&quot;, as well as his 2003 articles &quot;The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment&quot; and &quot;Looking Back and Forward&quot; (which describes the influence of his grandfather); and his 2005 article on stateless social organization &quot;From Upstate New York to the Horn of Africa.&quot;

In 1971, Werner Stiefel of Stiefel Laboratories commissioned MacCallum to write a master lease form for Operation Atlantis, a project designed to create a new voluntary nation in international waters. Stiefel&#x27;s vision aligned with the ideas introduced by Spencer Heath, so MacCallum was the ideal person to help him develop the &quot;constitution&quot; for the new form of governance.

Although Operation Atlantis was defeated by disasters both natural and man-made, the lease form took on a life of its own as the master lease for &quot;Orbis,&quot; an imaginary settlement in outer space. This fiction was due to Stiefel&#x27;s concern about calling attention to his plan for a new form of governance on the ocean.

In 2005, MacCallum also edited and published &quot;The Law of the Somalis&quot; by Michael van Notten. The book deals with the foundations of the Somali customary law (&quot;Xeer&quot;).

Through his grandfather, MacCallum met alternative currency theorist E. C. Riegel. After Riegel&#x27;s death, MacCallum obtained all Riegel&#x27;s papers, which now reside with the Heather Foundation, of which MacCallum was the director. During the 1970s, MacCallum re-published Riegel&#x27;s books &quot;The New Approach to Freedom&quot; and &quot;Private Enterprise Money&quot; and collected his papers into a new book called &quot;Flight from Inflation: The Monetary Alternative.&quot;

In 1976, MacCallum discovered artisan Juan Quezada, who soon became the leader of the now-thriving pottery movement located in Mata Ortiz, a small town near the ancient Paquime (or Casas Grandes) ruins in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. McCallum was the author of many articles on Mata Ortiz and an introduction to the book, &quot;Portraits of Clay: Potters of Mata Ortiz&quot;. His efforts helped the pottery win acceptance as a contemporary art form and a legitimate folk art.

MacCallum lived in nearby Casas Grandes and played a key role in Mata Ortiz affairs. Additionally, MacCallum had assisted archaeological investigations in the region by providing a compound to serve as quarters and lab space. He also hosted writers and artists at his properties in Casas Grandes.

==Proprietary communities==
MacCallum developed the idea of proprietary communities. In &quot;The Art of Community&quot;, MacCallum defines community as follows:

: &quot;A community is an occupation by two or more persons of a place divided into private and common areas according to a system of relations which defines and allocates responsibility for the performance of all activities that might be required for its continuity.&quot; (p. 3)
: &quot;A proprietary community is a community administered as a proprietary enterprise in which the relations of every member of the community are formed directly with the proprietary authority.&quot; (p. 5)

Proprietary communities are thus distinguished from other types of community such as private communities, voluntary communities, and intentional communities by the fact that none of these latter types of community are necessarily organized on a proprietary basis. For example, residential communes, Amish communities, and Israeli kibbutzim are voluntary, but not proprietary. Importantly, proprietary communities are also distinguished from private communities such as home owners&#x27; associations, which operate on political principles (democratic voting by the multiple owners), not on proprietary principles (which require a single owner who leases units to multiple tenants). Examples of proprietary communities include hotels, marinas, office buildings, industrial parks, entertainment complexes, and ever-larger and more complex combinations of these.

In &quot;The Art of Community&quot; MacCallum argues that the property relations in a community fundamentally determine the physical structure and dynamics of the community. He writes that proprietary leasehold communities provide an optimal incentive system for communities by internalizing externalities and solving many of the coordination and cooperation problems that plague contemporary societies.

<text>Victoria Camargo (born May 22, 1945), known professionally as Victoria Wyndham, is an American actress best known for her role as Rachel Cory on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Early years==
Born on May 22, 1945, in Chicago, Victoria Camargo, Wyndham is the daughter of Florence Skeels and Mexican-American stage and screen actor Ralph Camargo. She grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and graduated from Bennett College. Her sister is stage actress Felice Camargo.

==Early career==
Wyndham started her acting career as understudy in the role of Hodel in the Broadway production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. She went on to perform cabaret with Lily Tomlin for two years at Upstairs at the Downstairs.

==Daytime television credits==
Wyndham first made a name for herself when she played Charlotte Waring Fletcher Bauer, (posing as Tracy Delmar) on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1967 to 1971. When she left &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, she became a hot commodity in casting circles, with many soap operas offering contracts to her. She admitted in a &quot;TIME&quot; magazine interview that she almost did not follow through with a career in soap operas. Wyndham said, &quot;When I first went into soaps, I didn&#x27;t tell my serious acting friends. I thought they&#x27;d laugh. But now I&#x27;m proud of my work; some of the best acting, best moments are in this medium.&quot; She was subsequently cast on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; in the role of Rachel, for which she is perhaps best known. Wyndham succeeded actress Robin Strasser in the role and portrayed Rachel from 1972 until the show ended in 1999. Wyndham also was a writer.

When Wyndham took over the role from Strasser, the character was a villain. The head writer at the time, Harding Lemay, was impressed by Wyndham&#x27;s range and decided to take the character in different directions. The character of Rachel was reformed after being paired with a much-older book publisher, Mackenzie Cory (Douglass Watson). It made Wyndham very popular with fans and proved to be very lucrative as well. Although highly regarded, Wyndham did have one peculiar run-in with a fan: author Annie Gilbert, in the book &quot;All My Afternoons&quot;, noted that Wyndham was mildly assaulted when an enraged fan, fed up with Rachel&#x27;s scheming ways and thinking Wyndham was her character, attempted to punch her at a Lord &amp; Taylor store in New York City, all the while screaming, &quot;I hate you! I hate you!&quot;

In the later years of the program, Wyndham took on the double role of Justine Duvalier, Rachel&#x27;s new husband Carl&#x27;s ex-lover. She played the dual role for two years (1995 and 1996) before Justine was killed off. Wyndham was honored with a special episode showcasing her noteworthy performances on &quot;Another World&quot; in July 1997. At the time of the show&#x27;s cancellation, she was the longest-running performer on the series.

==Later career==
Wyndham appeared in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; on January 2, 2007, as Rita Colino, a former wife of the dead partner of Brian Dennehy&#x27;s character.

==Filmography==


== Personal life ==
Wyndham married investment broker Wendell Minnick. Her sons are actor Christian Camargo (né Christian Minnick) and photographer Darian Minnick.

<doc id="704540" wikidata="Q72262" url="?curid=704540" title="David Hedison">
<text>Albert David Hedison Jr. (May 20, 1927 – July 18, 2019) was an American film, television, and stage actor. He was known for his roles as the title character in &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958), Captain Lee Crane in the television science fiction drama &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1964–1968), and CIA agent Felix Leiter in two James Bond films, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989).

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Armenian immigrants Albert David Hedison (Heditsian) Sr () and Rose Boghosian (). Hedison decided he wanted to be an actor after he saw Tyrone Power in the film &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;. Hedison enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1945 during World War II, but the war ended before he completed basic training. He served 18 months before his discharge.

He began his acting career with the Sock and Buskin Players at Brown University before moving to New York to study with Sanford Meisner and Martha Graham at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio.

He was billed as Al Hedison in his early film work until 1959 when he was cast in the role of Victor Sebastian in the short-lived espionage television series &quot;Five Fingers.&quot; NBC insisted that he change his name, so he proposed his middle name, which was accepted; he was billed as David Hedison from then on.

===Theatre===
He acted at Newport Casino Theatre. In 1951, he won a Barter Theatre Award for most promising young actor, entitling him to work at a theatre in Virginia. He did radio in North Carolina and worked on stage in Pittsburgh.

His work on the New York stage included an appearance in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1952). He was studying with Uta Hagen who recommended him for a role in the Broadway production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1956), directed by Michael Redgrave. It ran for 48 performances on Broadway. The Theatre World declared Hedison as one of the most promising theatre personalities of the 1955–56 season.
===20th Century Fox===
After his role in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;, Hedison signed a film contract with 20th Century Fox in May 1957. His first movie with them was the classic war film &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957), which also starred Robert Mitchum.

He followed that up with the lead role in the horror film &quot;The Fly&quot; (1958) with Vincent Price as his brother. Hedison got the role after Rick Jason turned it down. The film was very successful at the box office.

Hedison went to England to play the lead role in &quot;The Son of Robin Hood&quot; (1958).

===Television===
Hedison was cast in the lead of a TV series made by Fox for NBC, &quot;Five Fingers&quot; (1959). He was reluctant to make it, especially when NBC insisted he change his first name (Al) to David (which was his middle name). The series lasted only one season.

Hedison had the lead role in an adventure film &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960), directed by Irwin Allen. 

Hedison guest starred on some Fox shows, &quot;Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. He co-starred with Tom Tryon in &quot;Marines, Let&#x27;s Go&quot; (1961).

Hedison worked regularly on television, guest starring in &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He co-starred in an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot;, starring Roger Moore who became a great friend. The episode&#x27;s plot prophetically involves Moore&#x27;s Saint mistaken for 007 and Hedison as an FBI agent — roles they would play seven years later as 007 and Felix Leiter in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. He was one of many stars in the film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). 

After turning down the role of Captain Crane in the film version of Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, Allen again offered the same role to him in the television series of the same name, co-starring with Richard Basehart, which ran from 1964 to 1968.

After &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; concluded, Hedison was offered the role of Mike Brady on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, but turned it down, stating, &quot;after four years of subs and monsters, who needs kids and dogs?&quot; The role eventually went to Robert Reed.

Hedison moved to London. &quot;I liked London very much,&quot; he later said. &quot;I just wanted to go and spend a couple years there ... It&#x27;s two years I&#x27;m not sorry for. The problem was, when I came back to the US, it was more difficult getting work then.&quot;

Hedison guest starred on &quot;Journey to the Unknown&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;ITV Sunday Night Theatre&quot;; the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot;; &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;; and &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot;. He could be seen in &quot;Kemek&quot; (1970), &quot;A Kiss Is Just a Kiss&quot; (1971), &quot;Crime Club&quot; (1973), &quot;The Cat Creature&quot;, and &quot;The Man in the Wood&quot;. He was most proud of doing an adaptation of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; with Lee Remick.

===James Bond appearances===
Hedison played Felix Leiter in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), with his friend Roger Moore starring as the new James Bond. Bond scholars Pfeiffer and Worrall praised the friendship between Leiter and Bond for being depicted with &quot;genuine chemistry&quot; between the two.

Sixteen years later, Hedison returned to play Leiter in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989), with Bond now being portrayed by Timothy Dalton. Hedison became the first actor to reprise the role of Felix Leiter and is the only actor to play Leiter with two different James Bonds.

Hedison thought he was asked back because &quot;there was much more to do in the film than in the past, and they were afraid of using an unknown or someone they were not quite sure of.&quot; &quot;I think in this kind of film, it won&#x27;t lead to other work unless you do something stand-out with a really wonderfully written scene,&quot; added Hedison. &quot;Otherwise you&#x27;re just doing a job, part of the ensemble. And in this case, I have lots of action scenes, but no one scene that is memorable ... Felix is a fairly one-dimensional character, you never get into any depth. You do what you can. There&#x27;s not much to play. All you can do is perform it with a simple reality ... It was running around, bang bang, getting wet, screaming and yelling, and all kinds of fun, but not serious acting.&quot;
===1980s===
Hedison toured with Barbara Anderson and Anita Gillette in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Two&quot; in 1979 and 1980.

He could be seen in the movie &quot;North Sea Hijack&quot; (1980), which starred Roger Moore, and TV episodes of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;Amanda&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;The Law &amp; Harry McGraw&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

He was in &quot;The Awakening of Cassie&quot; for &quot;Romance Theatre&quot;, &quot;Kenny Rogers as The Gambler: The Adventure Continues&quot;, and &quot;The Naked Face&quot; (1984) with Moore.

Hedison appeared in the West Coast premiere of &quot;Forty Deuce&quot; in 1985. 
===Later career===

From 1991 to 1996, Hedison was a regular on the long-running soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

He also starred in the New York City premiere of &quot;First Love&quot; with Lois Nettleton in 1999. He returned to the Cape Playhouse to appear in &quot;Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2002), and at Monmouth University&#x27;s Pollak Theatre, in &quot;Love Letters&quot; with Nancy Dussault in 2007.

He had a role in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and could be seen in &quot;The Reality Trap&quot; (2005).

In 2006, he acted in &quot;The Scent of Jasmine&quot; at the Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles on November 13. In 2008, Hedison performed &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Actors Studio West. He also participated in performances of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; in Los Angeles in 2009. He later appeared in &quot;The Marriage Play&quot; by Edward Albee.

He was in &quot;Superman and the Secret Planet&quot; and &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Jesus Jerk&quot;.
==Personal life==
He and his wife Bridget were married in London on June 29, 1968. Bridget Hedison died of breast cancer on February 22, 2016. They had two daughters, actor/director/photographer Alexandra Hedison and editor/producer Serena Hedison. Alexandra Hedison has appeared in &quot;L.A. Firefighters&quot; and &quot;The L Word&quot; and is married to actress and director Jodie Foster.

<text>Sister shows, also known as companion series, are two or more television series which exist in the same fictional universe and which may have crossovers. They differ to a degree from spin-offs, in that they are established independently from one another. The popularity of most series is limited to a few seasons, and sister shows allow expanding the immediate audience and ratings share. This is accomplished by using mostly different actors and production facilities. Sister shows often shift styles or target audience slightly, for a larger overall market. Thus &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; emphasizes slapstick, while &quot;Green Acres&quot; emphasizes surreal humor.

==Examples==
* &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Constantine&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Batwoman&quot;.
* &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;Jessica Jones&quot;, &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, &quot;Luke Cage&quot;, and &quot;The Defenders&quot;.
* &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot;
* &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; and &quot;The Pacific&quot;.
* &quot;The King of Queens&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;.
* &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Young Hercules&quot;.
:The character Xena proved popular on &quot;Hercules&quot; and a second series started.
* &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (which join &quot;General Hospital&quot;).
:From 2004 to 2005, they featured a crossover storyline told on both series.
* &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;.
:&quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; premiered during the eighth season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Both occasionally had crossover plots. &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; likewise featured crossover character appearances.
* &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.
:&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; began during the sixth season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Several characters from the older series appeared in the newer, but only one episode of the older (&quot;Birthright&quot;) had characters from the newer. All the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series are in the same universe, and there were many shared concepts and characters.
* &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.
:All three take place around the town of Hooterville. Guests appear in &quot;Green Acres&quot;, although the plots are not linked.
* The Trumptonshire series had Camberwick Green, Trumpton and Chigley villages in the same area. Gordon Murray stated that the area of &quot;Trumptonshire&quot; is &quot;representative of real locations which are one-and-a-half miles from each other in an equidistant triangle&quot;. Several characters appear in guest roles in other villages.
* &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.
:Known for frequent crossovers, the latter was planned by William J. Bell to be a sister show. Characters have gone between the two series regularly since the 1990s.
* &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; (which join &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;).
:&quot;Guiding Light&quot; was joined by a sister show, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, in 1956 and was also joined by another sister show, &quot;Another World&quot;, in 1964.
* &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot; American Dad!&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;
* &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;

* &quot;The Loud House&quot; and &quot;The Casagrandes&quot;.
* &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;.
:Although &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; are explicitly linked, mostly through several shared characters and plot threads, the connection to &quot;Millennium&quot; is only concretely expounded in one episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and one episode of &quot;Millennium&quot;.
* &quot;Eureka&quot;, &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; and &quot;Alphas&quot;.

<text>Charles Keating (22 October 1941 – 8 August 2014) was an English actor.

==Background==
Keating was born on 22 October 1941 in London to Roman Catholic parents who had emigrated from Ireland, Charles James Keating and Margaret (née Shevlin) Keating.

Keating moved to the United States via Canada with his family as a teenager. He was working as a hairdresser in Buffalo, New York, when a customer suggested he try out for a local play, and he made his stage debut in 1959 with the Buffalo Studio Theatre.

Keating found steady work with the Cleveland Play House repertory company and was on tour when he met his future wife, actress Mary Chobody. The two were married in 1964 while Keating was serving in the United States Army and directing plays for its entertainment division at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. Keating later acted at the Charles Playhouse in Boston before eventually joining the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis. In 1971, Tyrone Guthrie asked him to move back to England and open the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield.

==UK career==
Keating appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon before turning to television (he was in the pilot episode of the long-running ITV series &quot;Crown Court&quot; in 1972), winning the roles of Ernest Simpson in &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; and Rex Mottram in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. In 1978 on the BBC Shakespeare series, he played the role of Rutland, Duke of Aumerle, in &quot;Richard II&quot;.

==US career==
===Television/soap operas===
Keating is best known for his role as Carl Hutchins in the American soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; from 1983 to 1985, and again from 1991 to 1998 with a final appearance in 1999. He also played Charles in the satirical miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot; in 1986, which parodied the prime-time soaps of the day such as &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;.

After &quot;Another World&quot; ended its run, he returned to stage acting and Shakespeare in a two-person show with former &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Victoria Wyndham.

During 2001 and 2002, Keating played the part of James Richfield in &quot;Port Charles&quot;.

Between stints on &quot;Another World&quot;, he played Dr. Damon Lazarre on &quot;All My Children&quot;, and Niles Mason on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. He also had a role as a professor at a Caribbean medical school that catered to Americans in the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Going to Extremes&quot; as well as a guest role on &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

===Feature films===
In 1992, he appeared as Klingman in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. In 1999, he appeared as Freidrich Golchan in “The Thomas Crown Affair”. In 2005, he played the role of Gian-Carlo in &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot;.

===Theatre===
Broadway roles include &quot;Loot&quot; by Joe Orton (1986), for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play, &quot;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&quot; (1968) and &quot;The House of Atreus&quot; (1968), which comprised three classics: &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;Choephori&quot;, and &quot;Eumenides&quot;.

In 2001, he played the role of Carney/Oscar Wilde in the Lincoln Center performance of &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot;. In 2007, he played the role of Clement O&#x27;Donnell in the Guthrie Theater production of Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;The Home Place&quot;.

==Awards==
At the 23rd Daytime Emmy Awards, Keating won the 1996 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the role of Carl Hutchins on &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Death==
Keating died of lung cancer at the age of 72 on 8 August 2014 in Weston, Connecticut. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and the couple&#x27;s two sons.

<text>Waterzooi () is a soup from Belgium and originating in Flanders. The second part of the name derives from the Middle Dutch terms &quot;sode&quot;, &quot;zo(o)de &quot;and &quot;soot&quot;, words referring to the act of boiling or the ingredients being boiled. It is sometimes called &quot;Gentse Waterzooi&quot; which refers to the Belgian town of Ghent where it originated. The original dish is often made of fish, either freshwater or sea, (known as &quot;Viszooitje&quot;), though today chicken &quot;waterzooi&quot; (&quot;Kippenwaterzooi&quot;) is more common. The most accepted theory is that rivers around Ghent became too polluted and the fish there disappeared. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor ate the rich dish, even after suffering from gout.

==Varieties==
All versions are based on a soup-base of egg yolk, cream, and thickened vegetable broth. The stew itself contains fish or chicken, vegetables including carrots, onions, celery, leeks, potatoes and herbs such as parsley, thyme, bay-leaves and sage.

===Fish===
Originally, burbot was used but this fish had all but disappeared from the rivers until its recent return due to conservation efforts. Nowadays, fish such as eel, pike, carp and bass are used, though other fish such as cod, monkfish, or halibut can be used. &quot;Gentse Waterzooi van Tarbot&quot; includes turbot.

===Meat===
Chicken is a popular alternative to fish in the recipe, though the rest of the ingredients remain the same.

<text>George Kilpatrick Reinholt (August 22, 1940 – November 11, 2013) was an American actor.

Reinholt played the character of Erik Fulda in &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; for a year starting in 1967.

His greatest fame came with two subsequent soap roles: Steve Frame on &quot;Another World&quot; from 1968 to 1975, and Tony Harris Lord on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1975 to 1977.

After retiring from acting Reinholt swore off any comebacks in the medium. His resolve was weakened twice, once when he returned briefly for AW&#x27;s 25th anniversary show in 1989, and another time when he considered returning in the mid-1990s. However he was not hired for any of the jobs he tested for.

In 1997 Reinholt placed an ad in a local paper offering his services to take women to parties or other events. Some of the press implied he was selling himself as an escort, in a sexual manner. Reinholt was furious and appeared on the &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot; talk show to clear up the record.

On November 11, 2013 Reinholt died of cancer at his home in Essington, Pennsylvania at the age of 73.

<text>Clive Bull (born 23 January 1959) is an English radio talk show host, best known for presenting a late-night show on LBC in London.

==Background==
Bull was educated at Dulwich College in south east London, between 1970 and 1977 where he was a leading light of the tape-based &quot;College Radio&quot;. He has a degree in Educational Broadcasting from the University of London and a distinction in Radio Journalism from The National Broadcasting School.

He joined LBC as a telephone operator. He worked as a producer for Steve Allen&#x27;s LBC show &quot;Nightline&quot; and later went on to review books for the same show. Later he presented a range of programmes including gardening phone-ins and the station&#x27;s youth programme &quot;Young London&quot;. His big break was as host of the overnight &quot;Clive Bull Through the Night Show&quot; which ran for several years in the early 1990s. In 1994 he was hired by London News Talk 1152 (as LBC&#x27;s AM service was briefly known) to host the weekend late-night slot. The following year he moved to weeknights where he remained for 16 years.

==LBC radio show==
Bull&#x27;s show aired live Sunday to Thursday from 10pm to 1am. With slight variations in show times, Bull occupied the same late night slot from 1995 to 2011 despite numerous changes of station brand and ownership during this time.

Discussions tend to focus around two or three topics each evening based loosely upon what is in the news, or what interests or affects Bull. However, he encourages callers to talk about whatever they like, on the basis that more interesting discussions come from things people genuinely care about. There were special-interest nights, including the successful science hour series with Brian J. Ford. Between 1999 and 2007 Bull&#x27;s show was produced by Bob Johnson, who produced his last show on Thursday 20 December 2007. Previous producer Dan Wright went on to work for Independent Television News and CNN.

The 1991 short television programme &quot;Night Caller&quot; followed the callers to Bull&#x27;s through-the-night show.

In June 2011, Bull said he would be taking a break from talk radio, stating that: &quot;After thirty wonderful years with LBC, I&#x27;m looking forward to being up all day and going to bed at a sensible hour&quot;. Bull was succeeded on the Late Show by his friend and former LBC colleague Anthony Davis. Less than a year later, Bull returned to LBC presenting Sunday to Thursday from 7pm to 10pm, starting on Easter Sunday 2012.

In September 2018, LBC announced a new autumn schedule. Bull moved to weekends to present Saturday 6-8pm and Sundays 6-9pm shows. In January 2019 these were changed to Saturday 6-10pm &amp; Sunday 6-9pm. In September 2020 these were changed to Saturday 1-4am &amp; Sunday 1-4am.

==Acclaim==
In June 2005, Bull came 19th in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; survey of the forty most powerful people on radio, the highest ranked phone-in host. He was described as &quot;a brilliant phone-in host who knows that the way to make captivating talk radio is not to rant or rage, but to create a separate world, away from the nonsense of current affairs – then invite his listeners into it. His show is the most listened-to night-time programme in London and is an understated joy,&quot; while &quot;The Independent&quot; called him &quot;The Emperor of night-time talk radio.&quot;

&quot;The Observer&quot; said of Bull: &quot;There&#x27;s no-one quite like him. You get the impression that he&#x27;s living just a bit dangerously, and that&#x27;s what makes phone-ins exciting&quot;.

He has won several awards including a Bronze Sony Radio Award. The judges described him &quot;An exception to the run-of-the-mill phone-in. It was all down to the presenter who appeared so laid back that his callers could not see how he was teasing them. A very dry sense of humour and great fun.&quot;

He won Best Talk Show Host at the New York Radio Awards in 2001.

===Celebrity callers===
*Peter Cook made a series of calls with the pseudonym &quot;Sven from Swiss Cottage&quot;, a Norwegian fisherman who had come to London looking for romance and to escape the fish-obsessed phone-ins of Norway. Over time, Cook created an elaborate story of Sven&#x27;s attempts to find love, or to find his estranged wife, often claiming to call from remote parts of the world where he believed his wife may have gone. These have been recorded in &quot;Tragically I Was An Only Twin&quot;, a collection of his writings and are also available on Bull&#x27;s subscription podcast. Peter Cook&#x27;s former neighbour Rainbow George Weiss remained a regular caller with news of his political activities.
*Michael Barrymore once phoned in to take part in a talent contest as himself. He came seventh. 
*Tony Blackburn called in to defend Smart cars.
*Bruce Mansfield (aka: Bruce Mane) is an Australian personality who is the presenter of nightline on the Australian talk radio station 3AW. He is an aussie larrikin on the show who is looking for a wife to take back to Australia.
*Jane Horrocks answered a listener&#x27;s question about a movie (featured on 20 December 2005 Celebrity Callers Special). 
*Patsy Palmer, called in to join a discussion about Cockney accents, and on another occasion, for listeners to look out for her lost dog, which was subsequently found and returned to her (featured on 20 December 2005 Celebrity Callers Special). 
*Kerry Katona called in just before leaving to play &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; when Bull wondered whether she&#x27;d had a cosmetic surgery, which she said she hadn&#x27;t. 
*Iain Lee, used to make prank calls to the show. Years later he had his own show on the station.

<text>The Spokane River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northern Idaho and eastern Washington in the United States. It drains a low mountainous area east of the Columbia, passing through the Spokane Valley and the city of Spokane, Washington.

==Description==
The Spokane River drains the northern part of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene in the Idaho Panhandle, emptying into the Columbia River at Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, approximately downstream.

From Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, the Spokane River traverses the Rathdrum Prairie until reaching Post Falls, Idaho where it passes over a Post Falls Dam, and a natural 40-foot waterfall. Continuing westward it passes over 6 more dams, three of which (Upriver Dam, Upper Falls Dam, Monroe Street Dam) are located in the city of Spokane. In Spokane, it flows over the Spokane Falls, which are located in the heart of Downtown Spokane, approximately one third of the way down the river&#x27;s length. About a mile later, the river receives Latah Creek from the southeast. Soon afterwards, it is met from the northeast by the Little Spokane River, on the western edge of the city of Spokane. It flows in a zigzag course along the southern edge of the Selkirk Mountains, forming the southern boundary of the Spokane Indian Reservation, where it is impounded by the Long Lake Dam to form Long Lake, a reservoir. It joins Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Columbia from the east at Miles. The site of historic Fort Spokane is located at the confluence of the Spokane and Columbia rivers.

The Spokane River&#x27;s entire drainage basin is about large, of which are above Post Falls Dam at the outlet of Coeur d&#x27;Alene Lake. Its mean annual discharge is .

==Human use==
Until the 18th century, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene (Schḭtsu&#x27;umsh) and Spokane Native Americans (along with other Salish peoples) used to live and travel along the banks of the Spokane River.
In 1807, David Thompson was the first European to cross the Rocky Mountains and explore the area.

Today, the Spokane metropolitan area (population 573,493) is the largest human settlement on the banks of the Spokane River. The metropolitan area of Coeur d&#x27;Alene (pop. 170,628) is immediately to the east and upstream of the Spokane metropolitan area. The Spokane River and Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene are the primary sources of recharge for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, which is the primary source of drinking water for each of these settlements.

==Pollution==
The Spokane River contains some of the highest concentrations of heavy metals of any river in the state, resulting from pollution coming from Lake Coeur D&#x27;Alene and traveling from the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund site.

Spokane&#x27;s sewage treatment facilities empty their outflow into the Spokane River. In 1889, Spokane built a sewage system that dumped raw sewage directly into the river, which was visibly noticeable by 1920. In 1957 a primary treatment facility was installed; however, this was soon deemed inadequate by the Washington State Department of Ecology. This led to the construction of a more advanced treatment plant that utilized chemical precipitation technology, which was connected in 1975, and operational by 1977.

==Fish habitat==

After the Northern Pacific Railway lines arrived in Spokane in 1882, there was rapid growth in milling operations along the river. Many of these mills required dams to provide power for their machinery. As a result of the dams blocking the river, salmon populations in the Spokane plummeted, leading to complaints from many of the people living upstream. After the construction of Little Falls Dam in 1910 by Washington Water Power blocked upstream passage, the river&#x27;s salmon populations disappeared completely.

Steelhead were also abundant on the Spokane River, prior to pollution and the construction of the dams. Today, the Spokane River system is one of the two largest unoccupied stretches of steelhead habitat within their former range.

Today, the Spokane River supports populations of rainbow trout, northern pikeminnow, and Bridgelip Suckers (&quot;Catostomus columbianus&quot;), as well as several non-native species. Many of the remaining fish, however, are not suitable for human consumption due to the chemical pollution in the river, with signs alongside the river warning that the fish are contaminated with PCBs.

<doc id="704583" wikidata="Q6942967" url="?curid=704583" title="Muslim Students Association">
<text>The Muslim Students Association, or Muslim Student Union, of the U.S. and Canada, also known as MSA National, is a religious organization dedicated to establishing and maintaining Islamic societies on college campuses in Canada and the United States. It serves to provide coordination, community, outreach and support for affiliated MSA chapters in colleges across North America. Established in 1963, the organization now has chapters in colleges across the continent, and is the precursor of the Islamic Society of North America and several other Islamic organizations. The Muslim Students Association has at times been the subject of scrutiny; for example, the New York Police Department (NYPD) targeted MSAs across several US college campuses for monitoring as part of their Muslim surveillance program.

==Organization==
The Muslim Students Association of the U.S. and Canada is also known as MSA National. It is an umbrella organization for all of affiliated chapters at various campuses across the continent. Local chapters are only loosely connected with the parent institution, and often take different names, such as &quot;Islamic Students Association&quot;, or &quot;Muslim Discussion Group&quot;. Not all campus Muslim groups are necessarily affiliated with MSA National.

There is no fixed hierarchy between MSA National and local chapters; as such, the policies and views of the national organization are not necessarily shared by local chapters. The United States and Canada are divided into five zones, three in the US and two in Canada. Each zone has a zonal representative, chosen by the members of the affiliated chapters within that zone. Chapters make up regional councils.

==History==

The first MSA National chapters were formed in 1963 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) by international students. The initial leadership primarily came from Arabic-speaking and Urdu-speaking members, with guidance from students of the Egyptian-based Muslim Brotherhood and Pakistan-based Jamaat-e-Islami Islami movements. A Saudi Arabian charity, the wahhabist Muslim World League, provided early funding for the groups. Early goals for the movement included the promotion of &quot;a self-definition [that] involves initially and fundamentally [an] Islamic identity&quot; of its members, as well as an appropriate Islamic lifestyle while they were in the US.

With time, MSA groups became more interested in seeking how to integrate and institutionalize Islam and Islamic culture into American life. Current issues such as the position of women in Islam and problems in the Islamic countries began to be debated. The groups proved important as mobilizers in developing increasing Muslim political activity in the United States. Student leaders, as these graduated, went on to form the Islamic Society of North America. From the 1960s onwards, the MSA engaged in educational activities, including the translation and publishing of works by major Islamic scholars. In 1966 MSA founded the Islamic Book Service, to distribute magazines and books. In addition, books about Islam were distributed on campuses to both Muslims and non-Muslims. In the 1970s, a fiqh, or legal council was established by MSA; initially the fiqh rendered opinions on minor issues such as the start of Ramadan. By 1988, however, it was making decrees on a broad range of religious and social issues.

In 1994, after nearly 12 years of being virtually defunct, MSA National&#x27;s leadership held a first-ever strategic planning retreat at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, bringing 27 undergraduate and graduate students from around the US and Canada together. This retreat would spark the re-emergence of MSA National as an independent, unique organization with a dedicatedly first and second generation focus. Nearly all of the 27 students were born or raised in the US and Canada, and were of the next generation of North American Muslims, signifying a radical shift in MSA National&#x27;s future direction. From 1994 onward, MSA National held conferences on college campuses, convention centers and mosques around the US and Canada, with no guidance and direction from any other group or organization.

Fifteen years later, by 2010, yet another generation was poised to take the leadership of MSA National. Activities such as Project Downtown, the Fast-athon, and other regional and national projects were born. Now all of MSA National&#x27;s leadership was born in the US and/or Canada, and MSA began to make its own decisions and take positions on a variety of issues without regard to other groups or organizations.

==Activities==

Today, the organization is present in various forms on several campuses across the United States and Canada. In contrast to early membership, members are now frequently American-born Muslims. Activities include prayer times, lectures, discussion, and social events, and seek to unify Muslim students from different cultural backgrounds. At a campus level, groups lobby universities for recognition of Islamic holidays and prayer times, the availability and size of prayer rooms and for the provision of religiously permitted food on campus. MSAs engaged in various charitable activities. They raise funds through events known as &quot;Fast-A-Thons&quot;, which originated at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. The MSA launched a &quot;Peace ... not Prejudice&quot; campaign to dispel stereotypes and paint Islam in a positive light.

==Islam Awareness Week==
Islam Awareness Week was a project started in the early 1990s by the Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada. Its aim was to introduce Islam on a unified platform to all university and college campuses. During this week, each MSA offers information through a variety of resources and organizes activities in order to promote an understanding of Islamic principles and ideals. Information on Islam is presented in forms of topic tailored tables, free literature, and also through dialogue. Activities may include speeches given by prominent Muslim figures, interactive games, movie showings, or a night of Islamic entertainment and traditional ethnic dinners. Islam Awareness Week seeks to promote a positive understanding of Islam throughout the university community and hopes to build and strengthen connections and relationships within the university community for the promotion and recognition of Muslim North Americans.

==Controversies==

===Aafia Siddiqui&#x27;s possible radicalization at MIT===
Suspected al-Qaeda member Aafia Siddiqui was active in the MSA at MIT when she attended there in the 1990s and was known for participating in charity for Islamic organizations.

Journalist Deborah Scroggins, in exploring how Siddiqui might have become an Islamist extremist, wrote for &quot;Vogue&quot; that if Siddiqui &quot;was drawn into terrorism, it may have been through the contacts and friendships she made in the early 1990s working for MIT&#x27;s Muslim Students Association. Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world&#x27;s oldest and biggest Islamist movement, established the first MSAs in the country... and the movement&#x27;s ideology continued to influence the MSA long after that. At MIT, several of the MSA&#x27;s most active members followed the teachings of Abdullah Azzam, a Muslim Brother who was Osama bin Laden&#x27;s mentor.&quot; According to Scroggins article, &quot;[Azzam] had established the Al Kifah Refugee Center to function as its worldwide recruiting post, propaganda office, and fund-raising center for the &quot;mujahideen&quot; fighting in Afghanistan. ... It would become the nucleus of the al-Qaeda organization.&quot;

===Muslim Student Union at the University of California, Irvine===
The University of California Irvine Muslim Student Union is an affiliated chapter of MSA National, which was suspended for the 2010–11 school year for disrupting a speech given by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren at a university sponsored event. The students claimed they were exercising their right to protest and free speech. 

The program is being organized in conjunction with American Muslims for Palestine, a Chicago-based group that is dedicated to training college and high school students to advocate for Palestinian rights, speaking out against Israeli policy and military action that unjustly affects Palestinians.

===New York Police Department monitoring of MSAs===

The NYPD illegally monitored Muslim student associations in the Northeast US, citing a list of 12 people arrested or convicted on terrorism charges in the United States and abroad who had once been members of Muslim student associations. In rationalizing their monitoring activities, the NYPD noted they followed the same rules as the FBI, but several civil rights organizations argued that they engaged in unconstitutional racial and religious profiling and spying without evidence against individuals. The universities involved in the student monitoring included Yale; Columbia; the University of Pennsylvania; Syracuse; New York University; Clarkson University; the Newark and New Brunswick campuses of Rutgers; the State University of New York campuses in Buffalo, Albany, Stony Brook and Potsdam; Queens College; Baruch College; Brooklyn College and La Guardia Community College.

In one monitoring incident, a conference which was to be attended by MSA students included Siraj Wahaj, a prominent but controversial New York imam who has attracted the attention of authorities for years. According to the ACLU, as a result of ongoing spying through undercover police and informants, the covert program introduced distrust of law enforcement and a culture of community fear and stigma.

In June 2012, MSA National, along with other plaintiffs, filed suit against the City of New York, in New Jersey federal court. The suit alleged, on behalf of two New Jersey MSA chapters, that they were deprived of their Free Exercise rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeks to force the NYPD to expunge all data, information and conclusions regarding the Plaintiffs compiled by the NYPD.

In April 2018, the NYPD and the plaintiffs finally came to a settlement agreement. Among the terms of the settlement, the NYPD promised to stop and never again engage in surveillance based on religion or ethnicity, the NYPD also agreed to compensate Muslim owned businesses, individuals and Mosques for financial losses caused by the program as well the suffering and indignation caused by it.

===Racism and Arab/South-Asian bias===
In the 1970s, the MSA conducted a survey which showed that most &quot;felt like there weren’t enough efforts to include African-American Muslims and African-American students at MSAs across the country have offered their stories of exclusion and marginalization within the organization, saying that efforts to talk about race in the community are often met with resistance or dismissal.

The Black In MSA hashtag (or &quot;#BlackInMSA&quot;) generated discussion of the stereotypes and racism which African-American students were subject to in the MSA from Arab and South-Asian members. This included reluctance to engage with issues affecting African-American students on campus, reluctance to talk about racism, and hesitation or outright refusal to support African-American students and communities in the Black Lives Matter.

<text>Larkin Douglass Watson III (February 24, 1921 – May 1, 1989) was an American actor. He was best known for his portrayal of Mac Cory on the daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Life and career==


Watson was born in Jackson, Georgia, the son of Caroline (née Smith) and Larkin Douglass Watson, Jr., a teacher. Before his acting career, he received two Purple Heart awards for his service in World War II. A character actor since 1950, his most notable roles were in the movies &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986). He was also an acclaimed actor on the New York stage, acting in several Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including the 1952 Broadway revival of &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill. In addition, he played on such daytime dramatic dramas as &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; (1965) (a Canadian serial), &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1966–1968), and &quot;Love of Life&quot; (1972–1973).

Watson&#x27;s most iconic role was wealthy publisher Mac Cory on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. He was the second actor to play the role, taking over from Robert Emhardt. Watson earned the role after a critically acclaimed turn playing Kent in &quot;King Lear&quot; at the 1974 New York Shakespeare Festival. He portrayed the role from 1974 to 1989. He played the father of Tom Hanks&#x27; character in the 1986 film &quot;The Money Pit&quot;.

He won two Daytime Emmys for Best Actor, in 1980 and 1981. He was under contract at the time of his 1989 death of a heart attack, while on vacation in Arizona and the Connecticut Death Index gives the location as Bridgewater, Arizona. His character on the show also died shortly afterward.

<doc id="704596" wikidata="Q6023758" url="?curid=704596" title="Mechanical counterpressure suit">
<text>A mechanical counterpressure (MCP) suit, partial pressure suit, direct compression suit, or space activity suit (SAS) is an experimental spacesuit which applies stable pressure against the skin by means of skintight elastic garments. The SAS is not inflated like a conventional spacesuit: it uses mechanical pressure, rather than air pressure, to compress the human body in low-pressure environments. Development was begun by NASA and the Air Force in the late 1950s and then again in the late 1960s, but neither design was used. Research is under way at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on a &quot;Bio-Suit&quot; System which is based on the original SAS concept.

==Background==
The human body can briefly survive exposure to the hard vacuum of space unprotected, despite contrary depictions in some popular science fiction. Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. Human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon. This can be counteracted through mechanical counter-pressure from a suitably designed garment. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of oxygen starvation set in. Counteracting this requires a helmet to contain breathing gases and protect the ears and eyes. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents in very high altitude conditions, outer space, and training vacuum chambers.

== Cooling ==

Cooling of the astronaut with an SAS is generally achieved with evaporation from body perspiration which is emitted from the suit in all directions. Water, salts, and proteins can deposit on optics and other sensitive surfaces causing damage or degradation. This can limit the usefulness of an SAS. For the inflated spacesuits used on the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and the Apollo program, cooling was achieved in the Primary Life Support System by sublimation of water in a vacuum.

==Designs==

===Mauch===
In 1959 Hans Mauch was working on &quot;breathable&quot; undergarments for the Mercury space suit when he came up with the idea of a way to build a mechanical counterpressure design. The Mauch team noticed that closed-cell foams, which trap gas within their structure, expand when outside pressure is lowered. By containing the foam within a non-expanding outer layer, it would place increasing pressure on the body as the pressure lowered. This appeared to allow for a design that would offer far better mobility than the almost-rigid Mercury design.

Late in 1959 Mauch Laboratories was granted a contract by the US Air Force to develop a working model, as part of the Air Force&#x27;s secret X-20 Dynasoar efforts. The program ran until 1962, during which time NASA had joined the effort. The suit was built with a layer of foam sandwiched between two layers of fabric, the inner against the wearer&#x27;s skin (or undergarments) to provide mechanical support, and the outer providing containment. A separate, and bulky, helmet provided pressure and breathing gases. Like the undergarments that Mauch was developing for Mercury, thermal control was provided by direct sweat transpiration through the fabric. The resulting suit was about as bulky as the original Mercury design, excluding the large helmet.

Extended vacuum testing was carried out successfully, but the suit proved to have less mobility than expected and further development was dropped.

===Webb===

The introduction of improved fabrics led to Paul Webb&#x27;s concept for a new way to build an SAS. Further work was contracted in order to test various design concepts. Between 1968 and 1971 ten designs of increasing sophistication were built, leading eventually to a series of successful tests in vacuum chambers. The longest test was two hours and forty-five minutes.

The tests were successful: the practicality of a mechanical counter pressure spacesuit was demonstrated conclusively. The energy needed to move about was considerably less than conventional designs, which was a major improvement for long-duration spacewalks. Tests of punctures showed that up to a square millimeter of skin could be directly exposed to vacuum for extended periods with no permanent effect. A similar puncture in a conventional suit would result in a loss of pressure and breathing air. It weighed half as much as the primary pressure suit worn by NASA astronauts for Project Apollo, the A7L.

A number of problems also turned up, primarily related to the problem of keeping the suit in strong mechanical contact at every point on the body. Concavities or small folds in the fabric could lead to fluid pooling in the gaps; the groin area proved extremely difficult to tailor successfully. To correct this, small pads of polyurethane foam were inserted into concavities and were successful in most problem areas. The suits had to be tailored to each individual, although the same was true of all space suits of the era. The largest difficulty was donning and removing the suit. In order to effectively provide the minimum pressure of necessary for human physiology, the suit had to be extremely tight-fitting, making donning and doffing a highly strenuous task.

In 1971, Webb, along with James F. Annis, published their findings in a report. The report remained positive, and the researchers felt that further improvements were possible. Quoting the Report:

The original SAS design was based on two new fabrics: a type of &quot;powernet&quot; (or &quot;girdle fabric&quot;) for high-tension areas, and an elastic bobbinet weave for lower-tension areas. Both were based on a heavy elastic warp thread with a much less elastic weft thread to form a netting. The terms warp and weft are used loosely here, as the material was not woven using traditional means. Powernet used Spandex cord as the warp with nylon cord as the weft, allowing movement primarily along the warp axis. Bobbinet used cotton-wrapped rubber warp and nylon or Dacron weft, and was flexible in both directions. The cotton wrapping limited the maximum stretch to 200% of the rest length. The amount of over-pressure bobbinet could create was about over the torso, the largest volume, and up to over smaller radius curves on the wrist and ankles. Powernet could produce about even on the torso. A minimum of is needed for normal breathing.

Multiple layers and patches of the two materials were used to control the overall mechanical pressure around the body. Starting at the skin, a &quot;slip layer&quot; of light powernet was used to allow the outer layers to slide over the skin without binding. Under this layer a number of foam pads were placed on various concavities on the body to keep them in contact with the suit. On top of this was the counter-pressure bladder, part of the breathing system. On top of this were up to six additional layers of powernet over the trunk with bobbinet arms and legs, or all-bobbinet garments covering the trunk only. The garments were put on like a normal bodysuit with a large zipper closing the front, with additional drawstrings at some points to help close the garment. Zippers on alternating layers were offset.

The positive-pressure breathing system consisted of three main portions: the pressurized helmet, the breathing bladder, and the tankage system in a backpack. The bladder and helmet were connected together to pump air out of the bladder and over the torso when the user breathed in, reducing the amount of pressure on the user&#x27;s chest. The helmet was secured by means of a non-elastic garment of Nomex cloth which wrapped around the chest and under the arms, and by the elastic layers above and below it.

===MIT Bio-Suit===

The Bio-Suit is an experimental space activity suit under construction at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the direction of professor Dava Newman, with support from the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts. Similar to the SAS in concept, the BioSuit applies advances in engineering and measurement to produce a simplified version of the SAS design.

Newman has worked extensively in biomechanics, especially in the field of computerized measurement of human movement. As with gas-filled suits, Newman has used the principle of &quot;lines of non-extension&quot;, a concept originated by Arthur Iberall in work dating back to the late 1940s, to place the tension elements along lines of the body where the skin does not stretch during most normal movements.

The primary structure of the BioSuit is built by placing elastic cords along the lines of non-extension. Thus, whatever pressure they provide will be constant even as the wearer moves. In this way, they can control the mechanical counter-pressure the suit applies. The rest of the suit is then built up from spandex lying between the primary pressure cords. As of 2005, the Bio-Suit team had constructed at least three lower leg prototypes using different materials, including nylon-spandex, elastic, and urethane-painted foam. In one experimental design, kevlar fabric was used between cords for areas where the expansion was limited. At least one full-body suit has been constructed for Newman, which she has worn for numerous photo-ops; it is unknown if the entire suit meets the same counter-pressure standards that the lower-leg prototypes were designed for. Each suit has to be custom tailored for the wearer, but the complexity of this task is reduced through the use of whole-body laser scans.

The result is a one-layer version of the SAS; it is lighter than the original and more flexible, allowing more natural motion and decreasing the energy cost of motion. Versions of portions of the BioSuit have consistently reached , and the team is currently aiming for . As mechanical counter-pressure has proven difficult for small joints such as those in the hands, the BioSuit baseline design uses gas-filled gloves and boots, in addition to a gas-filled helmet.

A later variant of the biosuit employs heat-activated shape-memory alloy (SMA) coils. In this design the suit fits loosely on the body when initially donned. When a power module is attached, the spring-like coils in the suit contract to form-fit the suit to the body. The design of the coil was further defined in an article in the journal IEEE/ASME: Transactions on Mechatronics. As of 2008, the Biosuit reportedly had the potential to be ready for use in Mars missions in the near future.

As of 2019, an additional improvement has been made with the addition of nucleated boron tubes, which can shield the wearer of the suit from the radiation present in space and on the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. According to Cathy Lewis of the National Air and Space Museum, &quot;It may not be the next suit, but it will be one of the subsequent suits&quot;, indicating that development remains active and focused on future Moon and Mars missions.

== In fiction ==

Writers including Dan Simmons, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, and Spider and Jeanne Robinson have made use of space activity suits in their stories. The potential for greater mobility and simpler operation with a space activity suit make it an attractive choice for fiction, where flexibility of use can be a boon to plot development. The aesthetic qualities of a sleek, form-fitting space activity suit also contrast the traditional image of rigid, diving-suit-style spacesuits, lending a futuristic look to costumes. Most anime with futuristic themes include the skintight spacesuit (with the notable exception of &quot;Planetes&quot; and, to a lesser extent, the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise). In the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, a suit similar to this is referred to as a &quot;walker&quot; and is intended purely for use in the Martian environment. In the fourth book of the &quot;Jumper&quot; series by Steven Gould, the development of a mechanical counterpressure suit is integral to the main plot.

<text>William Holburne (died 1 April 1760) (also known as William Holborne and William Holburn) was an officer of the Royal Navy. He entered the navy, and may have served aboard the 74-gun third rate , during her time with Admiral Sir Edward Hawke&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre.

== Career ==
Holburne was promoted to command a sloop on 21 April 1747, and was further advanced to command HMS &quot;Prince Frederick&quot; on 15 April 1748. He was appointed to command HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; in 1755, during the Seven Years&#x27; War. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was part of a squadron commanded by William&#x27;s brother, Commodore Francis Holburne. William took command of the 74-gun in 1755, and Francis shifted his pennant to her.

William Holburne took command of the 80-gun , which formed part of the expedition to Louisbourg under his brother in 1757. He went to the Mediterranean in 1759, and served as part of Admiral Sir Edward Boscawen&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of Lagos. During the battle Boscawen&#x27;s flagship, was badly damaged and un-manoeuvrable. Boscawen therefore shifted his flag to Holburne&#x27;s &quot;Newark&quot;. Holburne did not command any more ships after &quot;Newark&quot;, and died on 1 April 1760.

== Family ==
William was son to Sir James Holburn, 1st Baronet, who started the Holborn Baronetcy. William was also a brother to Sir James Holburn, 2nd Baronet and Francis Holburne, a naval officer who rose to flag rank, and uncle to Sir Francis Holburn, 4th Baronet.

<doc id="704632" wikidata="Q4764843" url="?curid=704632" title="Animal Magic (TV series)">
<text>Animal Magic is a BBC children&#x27;s television series which ran from 13 April 1962 to 8 March 1983 from BBC Bristol. It began fortnightly and was transmitted weekly from 1964.

The presenter was Johnny Morris. The show combined jovial voiceovers applied to various animals from Bristol Zoo with some basic educational features.

Morris&#x27; co-presenters over the years were Gerald Durrell, Tony Soper, Keith Shackleton, Roger Tabor, Sheila Young, David Taylor and Terry Nutkins. When Nutkins joined the show in the early 1980s, the producers tried to update it, using new video effects technology. This allowed them to do such things as &quot;shrink&quot; the presenters to allow them to see life from an ant&#x27;s viewpoint, or to swim in a riverbed for example. Joe Henson and Desmond Morris also appeared on the show. Dotty the ring-tailed lemur appeared as a regular guest for eight years in the 1970s. Other animal stars included the sea lion Gemini, and two parrots, Cocky (a sulphur-crested cockatoo) and Brolly (an umbrella cockatoo). The show was discontinued in 1983 when the programme&#x27;s anthropomorphic treatment of animals fell out of fashion. A new children&#x27;s wildlife series, &quot;The Really Wild Show&quot;, began in 1986, with the former &quot;Animal Magic&quot; co-presenter Terry Nutkins as the main host.

One edition, broadcast in late 1979, featured Tom Baker in character as The Doctor from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, discussing ferocious animals on Earth and other worlds. During this programme, the Doctor references the events of the then-current serial, &quot;The Creature From The Pit&quot;.

The 100th edition was transmitted on 4 January 1967.

Many editions of the show were junked by the BBC in the early 1990s when they were assumed to be of no further use. Recent documentaries such as &quot;The Way We Went Wild&quot; have had to resort to using clips from off-air recordings of some shows.

In addition to airing on the BBC, the series was also aired on ABC in Australia, TV One in New Zealand and Channel 5 in Singapore.

==Theme tune==
The signature tune, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, performed by Group Forty Orchestra, was written by Laurie Johnson for KPM in 1960. It more recently featured as the theme music for BBC Two comedy &quot;W1A&quot; (2014–2017). Around 1980, the original orchestral version was replaced by a funk arrangement (featuring an electric guitar with a wah wah pedal).

<doc id="704652" wikidata="Q2262" url="?curid=704652" title="Kootenay River">
<text>The Kootenay River or Kootenai River is a major river of the Northwest Plateau in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, and northern Montana and Idaho in the United States. It is one of the uppermost major tributaries of the Columbia River, the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Kootenay River runs from its headwaters in the Kootenay Ranges of the Canadian Rockies, flowing from British Columbia&#x27;s East Kootenay region into northwestern Montana, then west into the northernmost Idaho Panhandle and returning to British Columbia in the West Kootenay region, where it joins the Columbia at Castlegar.

The river is known as the &quot;Kootenay&quot; in Canada and by the Ktunaxa Nation, and as the &quot;Kootenai&quot; in the United States and by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and Kootenai Tribe of Idaho. Fed mainly by glaciers and snowmelt, the river drains a rugged, sparsely populated region of more than , of which over 70 percent is in Canada. From its headwaters to its confluence with the Columbia River, the Kootenay descends more than . At their confluence, the Columbia and Kootenay are similar in length, drainage area, and volume, but less of the Kootenay is impounded in reservoirs and thus it has more free-flowing stretches with rapids and falls. Part of the lower Kootenay forms Kootenay Lake, one of the largest natural lakes in British Columbia.

The Ktunaxa (Kootenai) were the first people to live along the Kootenay River. For hundreds of years, they hunted and fished on the river, quite isolated from neighboring tribes. In the 19th century, Canadian explorer David Thompson became the first recorded European to reach the Kootenay and established trading posts throughout the region. A gold rush followed by silver and galena strikes in the late 19th century drew thousands of miners and settlers to the region, bringing developments such as railroads and steamboat navigation. The Doukhobors, a Russian religious sect, established a short-lived colony, Brilliant, at the Kootenay&#x27;s mouth; subsequently dispersing into many settlements, they contributed to the region&#x27;s timber and agricultural industries.

As with many Pacific Northwest rivers, many dams were built on the Kootenay in the 20th century to generate electricity and protect against floods and droughts. Water levels of Kootenay Lake are artificially regulated, and numerous hydroelectric dams block the river between Kootenay Lake and the Columbia River. Upstream of Kootenay Lake, most of the river is free-flowing with the exception of the Libby Dam in Montana, which forms Lake Koocanusa.

==Name==
The river was described with slightly different names by two groups of the local Ktunaxa (Kootenai) Indian tribes. These indigenous people who lived along the upper river knew it as &quot;aqkinmiluk&quot;, simply meaning &quot;river&quot;. The people along the lower river called it &quot;aqkoktlaqatl&quot;, a name whose meaning is not certain. The name &quot;Flatbow River&quot; comes from the name the Blackfeet used to call the Ktunaxa, for their &quot;powerful, stylish bows&quot;, and was later recorded by French-Canadian fur traders.

While searching for the ultimate source of the Columbia River, explorer David Thompson encountered Columbia Lake, where the Columbia River starts north as a small stream and the Kootenay rushes south, already a powerful river. Already knowing from earlier maps that the region included two rivers called the Columbia and the Kootenay, Thompson thought that what is now called the Columbia was the Kootenay, and he thought that he had not yet found the real Kootenay. Thence he applied the name &quot;McGillivray&#x27;s River&quot; to the real Kootenay in honor of his trading partners William and Duncan McGillivray. In his writings, the Columbia from Columbia Lake to the Big Bend was called the &quot;Kootenae&quot;.

The name &quot;Kootenai&quot; was also used by French Canadians to refer to the Ktunaxa in the 19th century. &quot;Kootenai&quot; is thought to be a word meaning &quot;water people&quot; in an Algonquian language. The river is still referred to as &quot;Kootenai&quot; in the United States, while in Canada it is spelled &quot;Kootenay&quot;.

Comparisons of various U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps from the 20th century show many misinterpretations or alternative names being applied to the segment of the river within the United States. These include &quot;Kootanie&quot;, &quot;Kootenie&quot;, and &quot;Kootienay&quot;. The Geographic Names Information System of the USGS lists &quot;Swan River&quot; as an alternate name, although the origin of this name is uncertain. (There is, however, a Swan River further southeast in Montana.)

==Course==

The Kootenay rises on the northeast side of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia and flows initially southeast through a marshy valley in Kootenay National Park. The river becomes significantly larger at its confluence with the Vermilion River, which is actually the larger of the two where they meet near Kootenay Crossing. The Kootenay continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and flows south into a gorge at the confluence with the White River.

At the small town of Canal Flats the Kootenay River passes within of Columbia Lake, the headwaters of the Columbia River, as it merges into the Rocky Mountain Trench along the eastern foothills of the Purcell Mountains. It receives the Lussier River near Skookumchuck Station of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the St. Mary and Wild Horse rivers at the historic mining town of Fort Steele, then receives the Bull River at the settlement of the same name. At Wardner, British Columbia, the Kootenay widens into the Lake Koocanusa reservoir. The Elk River, the Kootenay&#x27;s longest tributary, enters Lake Koocanusa south of Elko, British Columbia.

Stretching south and crossing the US-Canada Border, Lake Koocanusa is formed by Libby Dam east of Libby, Montana. The Kootenai (as it is now named) receives the Fisher River just downstream of the dam and turns west, forming the &quot;Big Bend&quot; around the southern end of the Purcell Mountains and Libby. About below Libby it drops over Kootenai Falls. The Kootenai turns northwest at Troy, Montana, before the Yaak River joins from the north as the river crosses into idaho. The Moyie River enters near Moyie Springs before the river enters the gentle terrain of the Kootenai Valley and turns north, flowing past Bonners Ferry and back towards the US-Canada Border.

The river re-enters Canada south of Creston, British Columbia, and flows through a marshy area called the Kootenay Flats before emptying into the -long Kootenay Lake. The lake is also joined by the Duncan River, the river&#x27;s highest-volume tributary. Near Balfour an arm of the lake branches westward to Nelson, where the Kootenay River exits the lake below Corra Linn Dam. The final westbound stretch of the river flows through a deep canyon, forming several waterfalls including Bonnington Falls, where four run-of-the river hydroelectric dams impound the river. Near Brilliant the Kootenay forms a small inland delta then enters the Columbia River near Castlegar.

== Watershed ==
At , the Kootenay river&#x27;s watershed is one of the largest sub-basins of the Columbia River system. The watershed stretches almost from north to south and from east to west, roughly defining a region of the Pacific Northwest known as the Kootenays. In Canada, the term &quot;Kootenays&quot; is loosely defined although the Kootenay Land District, which includes the whole region, is formally defined; the name indirectly refers to the territory of the Kootenay indigenous people spanning from the Rockies on the east and the, Selkirks and Purcells (Percells in the U.S.) on the west in southeastern British Columbia (BC), and is used to mean more the area drained by the Kootenay River, namely including the lower Canadian stretches of the Columbia from Revelstoke to the US border, and also the reaches of the upper Columbia north from Canal Flats at least as far as Golden (the Boundary Country is sometimes referred to as being part of the West Kootenay).

The Kootenay is the third largest tributary of the Columbia by both watershed size and discharge. Over 70 percent of the Kootenay&#x27;s watershed is in British Columbia, while 23 percent is in Montana and 6 percent is in Idaho. The Kootenay is one of only a few rivers that cross the US–Canada border multiple times: the others are the Milk River, a tributary of the Missouri River; the Souris River, a tributary of the Assiniboine River; and the Kettle River, a tributary of the Columbia River. 
The Kootenay River watershed is defined by rugged parallel mountain ranges of the Rockies, which direct drainage along a northwest–southeast axis. The only large areas of flat land are in the Kootenay River valley from Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Kootenay Lake, and in parts of the Rocky Mountain Trench from Canal Flats to Lake Koocanusa. Of the Kootenay&#x27;s many tributaries, the -long Duncan River is the largest. Hundreds of other tributaries join the river in its winding course, including the Vermilion, Cross, Palliser, White, Wild Horse, St. Mary, Elk, Fisher, Yaak, Moyie, Goat, and Slocan rivers.

Many river basins border the Kootenay—some are part of the Columbia Basin, while others drain to distant shores of the North American continent. On the south and southeast, the divide formed by the Cabinet and Whitefish ranges separate the Kootenay and Flathead River watersheds. The Flathead is a tributary of the Clark Fork River-Pend Oreille River system which borders the Kootenay watershed on the southwest. The upper Columbia River basin forms the boundary on the north, and the Kicking Horse River watershed also borders the north side of the Kootenay basin. To the southwest is the Priest River, a Pend Oreille tributary. On the east side, over the Continental Divide, the Bow River and Oldman River take rise. Both are tributaries of the South Saskatchewan River, which is part of the Hudson Bay drainage basin.

===Geology===

The geologic story of the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk, and Rocky Mountains. The mountains in much of the Kootenay River catchment are composed of Precambrian sedimentary rock of the Belt Supergroup, in turn, stratified into several subgroups with slightly different characteristics and ages.
However, most of the rocks have one thing in common; the rocks are generally hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow strip of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.

Bedrock composes much of the streambed in the upper and lower reaches of the Kootenay, but in the middle portion, alluvial sediments allow the river to meander over a broader valley floor. The sediments probably originated through heavy glaciation during the previous Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards into present-day BC, Montana, and Idaho, blocking the Kootenay River at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, which did not yet exist. Glaciers covered most of the northern Kootenay River watershed and heavily shaped the peaks and valleys one sees today. The glacier that formed Kootenay Lake caused the river to back up into an enormous body of water that stretched to Libby, Montana, near where the Libby Dam now stands, and possibly even connected to Lake Pend Oreille, which also was much enlarged at the time. Glacially deposited sediments buried the old streambed of the Kootenay River and created a natural dam where the Kootenay turns west out of Kootenay Lake. After the glaciers retreated, Kootenay Lake receded to its present level, and the Kootenay Flats were formed.

==History==
===First inhabitants===


The First Peoples of the Kootenay River valley (the residents at the time of European contact) were the Ktunaxa people (often referred to as &quot;Kootenai&quot;) from whom the river&#x27;s name derives. Ktunaxa creation myths state that their people were created by the Quilxka Nupika (&quot;supreme being&quot;) and have always lived in the region; one reads &quot;I have created you Kootenai people to look after this beautiful land, to honor and guard and celebrate my Creation here.&quot; However, linguistic and other evidence suggests that they are descended from Great Plains tribes that were driven out of their historic territory by the Blackfeet in the 16th century. The Ktunaxa are considered quite isolated from other Pacific Northwest and Great Plains tribes. Their language is an &quot;isolate&quot;, which is only distantly related (if at all) to the Salishan languages spoken by tribes of the Lake Pend d&#x27;-Oreille area. They were semi-nomadic people and inhabited a large area of the Kootenay valley from the headwaters to Kootenay Lake. Four villages provided their shelter in the winter, while in the rest of the year, they traveled between fishing, hunting and berry-picking areas. The northern Ktunaxa hunted buffalo, while the southerners mainly fished. Notably, the Ktunaxa were the first tribe west of the Rockies to capture and use feral European-introduced horses for their own use.

The origin and meaning of the name &quot;Kootenai&quot; are uncertain. Before their discovery by Europeans, they were known as &quot;Ksanka&quot;, &quot;people of the standing arrow&quot;. It is thought that French-Canadian fur trappers of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and other companies in the early 19th century were the first to refer to them as &quot;Kootenai&quot;, which means &quot;water people&quot; in an Algonquian language. It may also mean &quot;deer robes,&quot; referring to their excellent skill for hunting deer. In some written records from the early 19th century, also by the French, the Ktunaxa were sometimes called the Flatbows (&quot;Arcs plats&quot;) and the river called the Flatbow River. Other inhabitants of the area included the Montana Salish (in the south), and Shuswap (in the north), but these tribes were mostly not on the main river.

===Exploration===

In 1806, explorer David Thompson set out from Saskatchewan to find the source of the Columbia. He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived on the banks of the Kootenay, which he thought to be the Columbia. Thompson traveled down the river ways but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding the Columbia. They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to the Columbia, eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho, where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach the Columbia by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.
Through the early 19th century, Thompson continued to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, and for the few years when he had a total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written, &quot;I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company&quot;. When two of Thompson&#x27;s trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson &quot;placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks to get rid of it ... I told them what I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol.&quot; Of course, wine, beer, rum, and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.

In 1846, the Oregon Boundary Dispute was settled with the stroke of a pen and a straight line which ignored the topography. 

John Palliser crossed the Rockies through a pass in 1858 that led to the headwaters of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as &quot;Palliser&#x27;s River&quot;.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.
The series of expeditions he would later lead through 1859 were to be known as the Palliser Expeditions, or officially, the British North American Exploring Expedition, which, although involved some travel west of the Rockies, was mostly limited to the east side of the Continental Divide. Palliser&#x27;s earlier travels were credited for being a &quot;vital forerunner to the European settlement of the Prairies [of central Canada], providing volumes of information on the resources of this vast region.&quot;

In September 1859, Palliser traveled into the Kootenay River valley to find a suitable path for a trade route and possibly a railroad. Instead of crossing the Rockies, as Thompson did, Palliser set out from Fort Colville, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post near Kettle Falls on the Columbia River. He then proceeded up the Pend Oreille River (noted as &#x27;Pendoreilles&#x27;) and crossed into the Kootenay River valley, which in his records was either the &quot;Kootanie&quot; or &quot;Flat Bow River&quot;. Kootenay Lake was called &quot;Flat Bow Lake&quot;. Palliser was told by Ktunaxa tribal members that a trail already existed along the Kootenay River, terminating at Columbia Lake, but was in decrepit condition (having been out of use for many years) and &quot;entirely impracticable for horses&quot;. They re-blazed the trail for many miles and returned to Kootenay Lake by mid-October of the same year. The expedition&#x27;s findings were later to become important transportation routes through the Rockies to the Kootenays area, and the trail that they followed later became the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

===Gold and silver boom===

In 1863, a gold strike at the confluence of the Wild Horse and Kootenay Rivers in the East Kootenay region resulted in the Wild Horse Gold Rush in which between three and ten thousand men descended upon the area and the gold rush town of Fisherville was built; it had to be moved when it was discovered the town sat atop some of the richest deposits. Originally, the river (and the area) were known as &quot;Stud Horse&quot; by the early miners, but government officials changed it to &quot;Wild Horse&quot;. The new town&#x27;s site was officially named Kootenai (though still known as Fisherville), also spelled Kootenay and Koutenais and also known as Wild Horse. Galbraith&#x27;s Ferry was established across the Kootenay near Fort Steele to facilitate crossing by the incoming rush of prospectors and merchants. Most of the gold was mined out by 1864, in June of which one American prospector wrote that some 200 miners were arriving each day. By 1865 the peak of the rush was over, and the diggings had been found not as rich as previously believed when news arrived in 1865 of the strikes in the Big Bend of the Columbia and the bulk of the mining population moved there &quot;en masse&quot;.

Fisherville, which had a Hudson&#x27;s Bay post and other businesses, continued on with a few hundred residents for a few years (most of them Chinese by the end, as was the case with many other BC gold towns also) but was eclipsed as a supply centre with the creation of nearby Fort Steele. The Chinese miners continued to work the &quot;played-out&quot; claims abandoned by American and Canadian miners, taking what little gold was left. Fisherville eventually was abandoned, its buildings left to ruin, and little remains of the settlement today. Other gold rushes on the Moyie and Goat Rivers, tributaries of the Kootenay, were followed by the discovery of silver and galena mines in the Kootenay Lake and Slocan Valley areas (Silvery Slocan), leading rapidly to the settlement of the region and the creation of various &quot;silver city&quot; boomtowns, notably Nelson, at the outlet of Kootenay Lake, Kaslo, midway up its north arm, New Denver, Silverton, Slocan City and Sandon in the 1880s and 1890s. By 1889, a smelter had been constructed close to the mouth of the Kootenay, near Revelstoke, to process ore from the mines. Serving the mines and settlers, steamer companies plied the Kootenai River from Bonners Ferry, Idaho to Nelson and to the Lardeau or &quot;Lardo&quot; district at the north end of Kootenay Lake, and also on the upper Kootenay River between the Cranbrook-Fort Steele area and points in Montana.

===Steamboats===
When the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) finished its transcontinental line across southern British Columbia, steamboats began to ply the upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers, carrying passengers, produce, ore, and other trade items through the region to be distributed via the CPR&#x27;s line at Golden. The total run was about long, ranging from Golden to the north to Jennings, Montana in the south, with a portage at Canal Flats. Kootenay&#x27;s steamboat era was short and lasted for only about 28 years. In 1882, as part of an incentive to help navigation on the Golden-Jennings run and possibly divert water northwards to the Interior of British Columbia in order to provide flood control for a low-lying area south of Kootenay Lake, called Kootenay Flats, European adventurer William Adolf Baillie-Grohman proposed the creation of a canal between the Kootenay River and Columbia Lake.
Construction of the -long, -broad channel was finished in 1889. The Baillie-Grohman Canal, as it was called, had one lock which was long and wide.

Because of the rugged terrain and rough waters on the two rivers, especially on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved to be anything but cost-effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the &quot;Duchess&quot; and the &quot;Cline&quot;, sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to run the Kootenay was the &quot;Annerly&quot; in 1893. Later vessels, such as the &quot;Gwendoline&quot;, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. &quot;Gwendoline&quot; sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. &quot;Gwendoline&quot; eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.

The last ship ever to pass through the canal and one of the last on the Kootenay was the &quot;North Star&quot;, also piloted by Captain Armstrong. In 1902, Armstrong decided to take &quot;North Star&quot; to sail on the Columbia instead, finding business on the Kootenay less and less profitable as the mines in the region played out, as the CPR established its Kootenay Central Railway branch, and for a variety of other reasons. In June of that year, Armstrong took &quot;North Star&quot; to the Baillie-Grohman Canal, which was in decrepit condition. The lock was also too small to accommodate the vessel. Armstrong had two makeshift dams built to create a temporary lock long, and then the forward dam was blown up so the ship could ride the surge of water ahead into Columbia Lake. The transit of &quot;North Star&quot; to Columbia Lake was the last time the canal was ever used by a steamboat and marked the end of the steamboat era on the Kootenay.

===Doukhobor settlement===
In the 20th century, members of a Russian religious sect called the Doukhobors living in the plains of Saskatchewan in central Canada were facing persecution, internal problems, and land confiscation by the Canadian government. Their leader, Peter Verigin, decided to move them to British Columbia in 1909, seeking land and improved life. He chose a townsite on the north bank of the Kootenay, where it joins the Columbia, across the big river from where the present-day town of Castlegar now stands. In 1909, he purchased about adjoining the mouth of the Kootenay River partly using funds raised by sale of farm equipment in Saskatchewan, and added to other lands acquired throughout BC, Doukhobor-owned lands ultimately totaled . There was already a small settlement on the site, called Waterloo, but Verigin renamed it Brilliant, for the &quot;sparkling waters&quot; of the river. The whole area was known by the name, &quot;Dolina Ooteschenie&quot;, meaning &quot;valley of consolation&quot;. By 1913, there were already more than 5,000 Doukhobors living in the region.
When they first arrived in British Columbia, the Doukhobors began felling trees in the Kootenay River valley to build their first homesteads. They also cleared areas of level ground in order to plant orchards and fields and constructed sawmills on the Columbia and Kootenay rivers to process the logs into lumber. After more settlers began arriving, they built larger buildings that housed multiple families instead of the small cabins then typical of the region. Each larger house or &quot;dom&quot;, holding 70-100 persons each, was constructed on roughly plots of land that Verigin had divided the entire community into back in 1911. The Doukhobors then constructed a brick factory at the present-day site of Grand Forks, from where they made bricks to be used mostly in the Brilliant settlement. Brilliant was one of the first cities in the area to have running water; a reservoir was constructed to hold water from the Kootenay River and a local spring, and by 1912, each household had running water. In 1913, Verigin converted an abandoned factory in Nelson, about up the Kootenay from Brilliant, to produce jam and marmalade. The Doukhobors then established a ferry across the Columbia River, and a suspension bridge serving the same purpose was completed in 1913. 
For many years, Brilliant continued to be a major center in the region&#x27;s lumber industry.
However, Doukhobor views on education and the extremist actions of a Doukhobor group called the Sons of Freedom eventually spelled the end of their settlement. In the 1920s, unknown arsonists destroyed several public schools in Brilliant as an act against British Columbia law. Then in 1924, on a routine rail trip to Grand Forks, Peter Verigin and seven other people were killed by a dynamite explosion that completely destroyed the coach that he was traveling in. Pieces of battery and alarm clock indicated that this was the work of people who intentionally wanted to kill Verigin, most likely members of the Sons of Freedom, or as some historians put it, by the lover of one of Verigin&#x27;s handmaidens. Over 7,000 people attended Verigin&#x27;s funeral. The Doukhobor leader was buried in an elaborate tomb on a headland overlooking the city of Brilliant and the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers. Verigin was succeeded by his son, Peter P. Verigin, who arrived from Russia in 1927. Despite the economic reforms he created in response to debt to the federal government, his arrival coincided with a terrible depression and bankruptcy which caused the Doukhobors to lose most of their lands. Verigin Jr. died in 1939 and by 1963, almost all Doukhobor lands were sold to the government. Today, little remains of the former settlement at Brilliant except for Verigin&#x27;s tomb. The Doukhobor suspension bridge spanning the Kootenay River still stands, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.

==Ecology==

The Northwest Power and Conservation Council divides the Kootenay River watershed into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine reaches of the watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow ecozone occupies most of the high ridges and valleys of the mountains.

In the Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin, almost half of which is part of the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of terrestrial vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.

Riparian vegetation is mostly found along the lower two-thirds of the Kootenay and many of the tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.

Naturally, the Kootenay has a high sediment content because of high erosion of glacial sediments in the mountains. Because of the steep rapids and falls between Kootenay Lake and the river&#x27;s mouth, the Kootenay (with the exception of its tributary, the Slocan River) has never been a significant stream for the annual runs of Columbia River salmon. However, landlocked salmon inhabit the upper reaches of the river above and in Kootenay Lake. This is attributed to a Kootenay River flood a long time ago, before the construction of any dams on the Columbia (Columbia River dams now block salmon from reaching any of the salmon run streams above Chief Joseph Dam
) which overflowed into Columbia Lake. It was with the creation of this temporary body of water that salmon somehow managed to swim over the submerged Canal Flats and into the Kootenay, where they became trapped.

Populations of large land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining dramatically since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone that were once common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.

==Economy==
Even before non-aboriginal people came to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an important path of trade and transport between the tribes of the Canadian Rockies and the Idaho Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles of the south and east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that tribes of the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with the exception of the Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies).

Logging began in the 19th century as a result of white emigration to the Kootenay region, and remains one of the primary industries of the area. In fact, much of the economy of the Pacific Northwest and Columbia Basin has historically been, and continues to be, to this day, dependent on the lumber industry.
Lumber was required for the construction of buildings, forts, railroad tracks, and boats, and today is exported from the region in great amounts providing jobs and income for inhabitants of the area. Even in relatively uninhabited regions of the watershed, logging roads criss-cross the hills and mountainsides. Over 90 percent of the Kootenay basin is forested, but only about 10 percent of the area is not affected by some kind of lumber-industry development, now defined as about twenty &quot;roadless areas&quot; or &quot;blocks&quot;, with 18 in the US.

To a limited extent, the Kootenay River has also been used for navigation. Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and exported products between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated briefly on the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.
In modern times, boats continue to ply Kootenay Lake and limited reaches of the Kootenay River.
Mining is also an important economic sector of the Kootenay River area. Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today coal is the primary resource extracted from underground. Conventional coal deposits underlie much of the East Kootenay, especially in the Elk River valley which is home to the Elk Valley Coalfield, and the Crowsnest Coalfield in the Purcell Mountains. The East Kootenay is the most important coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world&#x27;s steel-making coal comes from the region.
Most of the coal from the East Kootenay coalfields is exported to Japan and Korea.

Lead, zinc, copper and silver are still mined at some places in the Kootenay River basin, notably at the giant Sullivan Mine near Kimberley, British Columbia, which is the largest in the Kootenay watershed. Agriculture, however, is a much less important industry, and many of the fertile riverside lands have been flooded by the construction of dams (most notably Libby Dam in Montana, which backs water into Canada). Only about two percent of the entire Kootenay basin ( is used for agriculture, and much of that is for pasture and foraging). Crops such as oats, barley and wheat account for 62 percent of the agricultural output of the region, much of which is used locally or exported by rail. The primary agricultural region is the Kootenai Valley of northern Idaho south of Kootenay Lake.

The West Kootenay, however, is transitioning from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and the rest of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is becoming increasingly reliant on tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks have already been established, and several national forests in the U.S.

==River modifications==

Dams, power plants and diversions of the Kootenay River, of which there are many, have been built for a variety of reasons throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The seven dams on the Kootenay serve many purposes, ranging from generation of local electricity to regulation of Columbia River flow between Canada and the United States. None provide for navigation or fish passage. In former times, the Kootenay would rise each spring and early summers with &quot;enormous freshets that every summer flood the Kootenay River valley&quot;. Such extreme variations are no longer common on the river below Libby Dam.

===The Falls===
As early as 1898, without building a dam, the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near the confluence of the Slocan River in order to supply water to mines in Rossland, British Columbia.
For Upper Bonnington, the first dam built on the river, the original goal was to improve navigation between Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay&#x27;s mouth on the Columbia by drowning the dangerous Bonnington Falls rapids that also blocked fish migration, and hopefully introducing fish to the upper river by constructing a fish ladder. None of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed — in fact, the dam ended up being built above the falls instead of below them— and Upper Bonnington Dam, when completed in 1906, only generated hydroelectric power, and has served that purpose ever since.

Commercial demand led to two more dams at the falls, these were South Slocan Dam in 1928, and Corra Linn Dam, at the rapids above Bonnington in 1932.
Three of the dams are of the run-of-the-river type, the 4.5 km length of the falls is now impounded in small lakes. All except Corra Linn, which was built to raise and regulate the level of Kootenay Lake. The Kootenay Canal Generating Station, completed in 1976 by BC Hydro, has its inlet at Kootenay Lake next to Corra Linn. The canal travels several kilometers, parallel to and above the river to utilize the roughly high water drop in elevation between Kootenay Lake and South Slocan, bypassing the old dams. The canal is used to generate hydroelectricity, as are the four dams.

===The Lower River===
After the falls and the junction with the Slocan River the last of the river is a gradual slope to the merger with the Columbia. In 1944 the last privately owned development Brilliant Dam was built, just before the Kootenay river flows into the Columbia River at Castlegar.

===Columbia River Treaty===

The Columbia Basin is noted for its spring floods, major flood years were 1876, 1894, 1948 and 1964. As recently as the mid-1960s, the upper Columbia and Kootenay rivers in British Columbia were still free-flowing and unaffected by dams and reservoirs, resulting in the 1948 Vanport Oregon flood. The uncontrolled discharge past the Canada-U.S. border created problems for electricity generation in the US, and Canada also wanted to utilize the Columbia river for the production of hydroelectric power. Negotiated in 1961 between the governments of the two countries, the Columbia River Treaty attempted to ratify these problems. Construction of the first three of the four dams authorized by the treaty—Mica, Keenleyside and Duncan—was implemented in 1964. Of the four dams, the first two are on the Columbia, the third is on the Duncan River, a tributary of the Kootenay, and the fourth Libby, on the Kootenai in Montana. However, operation of the dams has led to environmental problems in both rivers because they have caused unnatural flow fluctuations, blocked fish migration, flooded fertile agricultural land, and forced over 2,000 people to relocate.

Solely built for the purpose of regulating water flow into Kootenay Lake, Duncan Dam, the first dam built for the treaty, was raised in 1967 and increased the long size of Duncan Lake to a reservoir long. Because of its purpose, it has no power generation facilities. Libby Dam, the fourth and last dam built under the treaty, was completed in 1975 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The other two dams built for the treaty, Keenleyside and Mica, are both on the Columbia River. Kootenay basin reservoirs provide nearly of storage which constitutes almost half of the stored in Columbia River Treaty reservoirs.

===Diversion proposal===
In the 1970s, it was proposed that the Kootenay River be diverted into the Columbia River (the two rivers are separated by a distance of no more than near Canal Flats in the Rocky Mountain Trench in southeastern British Columbia). This would allow for the generation of increased hydroelectric power on the Columbia. It would also make easier the reclamation of the Kootenay Flats, an area south of Kootenay Lake, for agricultural purposes—spring freshets once raised the level of the lake by up to , inundating the lowlands around it. There were also never-implemented plans to divert part of the Kootenay enlarged Columbia River through a tunnel to the headwaters of the Thompson River in the northwest, and thence to the Fraser River valley of southwestern British Columbia.

The proposal was strongly opposed by both environmentalists as well as local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At the opposite end of the scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.

==Recreation==

===Parks===
Many national, provincial and state parks, wilderness preserves, protected areas and national forests lie partially or wholly within the Kootenay River watershed. In Canada, these include those listed below as well as many others.

*Bugaboo Provincial Park
*Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area
*Gilnockie Provincial Park
*Goat Range Provincial Park
*Kianuko Provincial Park
*Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park
*Kootenai Falls County Park
*Kootenay National Park
*Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park
*Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park and Protected Area
*St. Mary&#x27;s Alpine Provincial Park
*Top of the World Provincial Park
*Valhalla Provincial Park
*West Arm Provincial Park
Popular Banff National Park lies just across the BC-Alberta border, Yoho National Park sits to the north, and Glacier National Park in the northeast. The U.S. portion of the watershed includes Kootenai National Forest
and Kaniksu National Forest (part of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests, which stretch southwards into the state).

In Kootenay National Park alone, there are over of hiking trails, ranging from short day hikes to long backpacking trips. Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are popular on the park&#x27;s trails in the winter. Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, which sits right next to Kootenay in the Rocky Mountains, also has an extensive trail system affording extensive views of the surrounding ranges. Kikomun Creek Provincial Park, on the northeast shore of Lake Koocanusa, includes campgrounds and access to boat launches on the east shore of the lake. The Kootenai River Trail along the Montana section of the river,
about long, follows the river from Libby to Kootenai Falls and the well known Swinging Bridge across the Kootenai. Skattebo Reach Trail, on the lower river, is about long, running from Brilliant to Glade. Further downstream, five separate sites around Kootenay Lake form the Kootenay Lake Provincial Park. West Arm Provincial Park is on the impounded stretch of the Kootenay River just west of Kootenay Lake, and to the northeast of Nelson. Smaller Kokanee Creek Provincial Park, one of the more popular recreation areas in the West Kootenay, sits across the river from West Arm.

===Fishing===
Fishing is generally good on the middle reaches of the Kootenay River and in Kootenay Lake. Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, kokanee salmon (the landlocked Pacific salmon), rainbow trout and white sturgeon are among the many species found in the river. Kokanee and rainbows are commonly found in Lake Koocanusa. Kootenai Falls, which drops some within a run of a few hundred meters, forms a natural boundary between fishes of the upper and lower river, but Libby Dam, several kilometres upstream, is an even more formidable barrier. Fish in the Kootenay have traditionally been abundant but the construction of the dam may have led to declines in the population of sturgeon, among other fishes, because of changes in water flow. The best season for fishing is from June to November. One may fish from banks, sandbars and islands, or from boats. Because of the size and strength of the river, fishing from drift boats is easier than from the shore. Also, because the Kootenay&#x27;s primary sources are glaciers, fishing conditions are quite different from most rivers in Montana and Idaho, which are fed by snowmelt.
In the United States, the Kootenay, with its &quot;exceptional&quot; trout fishing, is considered a Blue Ribbon fishery.

===Boating===

Steep and strewn with rapids, the Kootenay, despite being unsuitable for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, is considered an outstanding whitewater river. Whitewater rafting is popular on the Kootenay in two stretches: in Jennings Canyon between the Libby Dam in Montana and Bonners Ferry in Idaho, and in the upper reaches of the river in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia.

Rafting the middle Kootenay between Libby Dam and Bonners Ferry is best at flows of . The run, about from east to west, includes Class IV+ rapids and includes Kootenai Falls, which rarely has been run safely, in the middle of its course. In Montana, the river is rated a Class I water under the Montana Stream Access Law for recreational purposes from Libby Dam to the Montana-Idaho border. Class I represents bodies of water that are navigable and suitable for recreation.

Rafting is also popular in some of the Canadian stretches of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.

<text>The Okanogan River (known as the Okanagan River in Canada) is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately 115 mi (185 km) long, in southern British Columbia and north central Washington. It drains a scenic plateau region called the Okanagan Country east of the Cascade Range and north and west of the Columbia, and also the Okanagan region of British Columbia. The Canadian portion of the river has been channelized since the mid-1950s.

==Course==

The Okanagan River rises in southern British Columbia, issuing out of the southern end of Okanagan Lake, which is on the north side of the city of Penticton. It flows south past Penticton, through Skaha Lake, past Okanagan Falls, through Vaseux Lake, and past Oliver to Osoyoos and Osoyoos Lake, which spans the Canada–United States border and has its outlet into the Okanogan River at Oroville, on the southern shore of the lake, in Okanogan County. At the border the river&#x27;s name (and the region and also the name of the Okanagan Highland) changes spelling from Okanagan to Okanogan. Average annual flow of the river at this point is 643 cfs (18.2 m³/s).

From Oroville the Okanogan River flows south through the Okanogan County, past Okanogan and Omak. It forms the western boundary of the Colville Indian Reservation. The Okanogan River enters the Columbia River from the north, 5 miles (8 km) east of Brewster, between the Wells Dam (downstream) and the Chief Joseph Dam (upstream). The reservoir behind Wells Dam, into which the Okanogan empties, is called Lake Pateros.

==Tributaries==

The Okanogan River receives the Similkameen River from the west near Oroville. It receives Omak Creek from the east near Omak, Tonasket Creek from the east near Oroville and Bonaparte Creek at Tonasket which flows from Bonaparte Lake near Wauconda and also from Aeneas Valley west of the Sanpoil. It occasionally receives water from Salmon Creek at the town of Okanogan but much of the year this water is diverted for irrigation.

==History==
The river takes its name from the Okanagan (or Syilx) placename [ukwnaqín]. The name Okanagan was subsequently applied to the Syilx people themselves. Early maps of the fur trade era show the Okanagan River as the &quot;Caledonia River&quot;, a name conferred as it was the connecting route between the Columbia District and the New Caledonia Fur District (which began north of Okanagan Lake).

Fort Okanogan, a fur-trading post opened by the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) late in 1811, was located at the river&#x27;s confluence with the Columbia. The isolation and pressures caused by the War of 1812 forced the PFC to sell its property and assets to its Canadian rivals, the North West Company. The NWC was in turn merged into the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1821, the latter company maintaining a presence at Fort Okanogan until the 1850s.

During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–1859, parties of armed miners, often at conflict with native peoples in the region, traveled the Okanagan Trail and its western branch, the Similkameen Trail, via the river. After hostilities subsided, the route continued to be important as the southern leg of the overland trail to the Cariboo Gold Rush known then by its fur trade era name as the Brigade Trail.

<text>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) is a professional society for the field of aerospace engineering. The AIAA is the U.S. representative on the International Astronautical Federation and the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences. In 2015, it had more than 30,000 members among aerospace professionals worldwide (a majority are American or live in the United States).

== History ==

The AIAA was founded in 1963 from the merger of two earlier societies: the American Rocket Society (ARS), founded in 1930 as the American Interplanetary Society (AIS), and the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (IAS), founded in 1932 as the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences. Paul Johnston was the first executive director of the organization. Jim Harford took his seat after 18 months. The newly-formed structure gathered 47 technical committees and one broad technical publication, the &quot;AIAA Journal&quot;. The &quot;AIAA Student Journal&quot; was also launched in 1963. The merger also led to the sale of the organizations&#x27; former headquarter buildings, and the relocation in the Sperry Rand Building.

In 1967, the Technical Committee on Space and Atmospheric Science launched a study to capture the opinion of its members in California on the UFO phenomenon.

== Activities ==
=== Journals ===
As a major activity, AIAA currently publishes several technical journals. The &quot;AIAA Journal&quot; is published on a monthly basis and serves as the flagship journal of the society. In January 2015 the &quot;Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics&quot; became the second AIAA journal published on a monthly basis. The other journals are published bi-monthly and have more specialized topics:

* &quot;Journal of Air Transportation&quot; (Starting in 2016)
* &quot;Journal of Aerospace Information Systems&quot; (formerly &quot;Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information, and Communication&quot;)
* &quot;Journal of Aircraft&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Energy&quot; (published from 1977 to 1983)
* &quot;Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Hydronautics&quot; (published from 1967 to 1980)
* &quot;Journal of Propulsion and Power&quot;
* &quot;Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets&quot; (Starting in 1964)
* &quot;Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer&quot;

AIAA&#x27;s flagship magazine &quot;Aerospace America&quot; was started in 1990 and is distributed monthly to all members, and is published online in digital format. AIAA also produces several series of technical books ranging from education to progress in advanced research topics.

=== Competitions ===
AIAA annually holds design competitions and Design/Build/Fly competitions to provide a real-world design experience for engineering students, both undergraduate and graduate, by giving them the opportunity to validate their analytic studies.

=== Conferences ===

AIAA hosts many conferences and smaller events throughout the year. The largest of those is the AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition (&quot;AIAA SciTech&quot;). Others include AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum and Exposition (&quot;AIAA Aviation&quot;), AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum and Exposition (&quot;AIAA P&amp;E&quot;), and AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum and Exposition (&quot;AIAA Space&quot;).

=== The AIAA Foundation ===

AIAA currently has over 6,500 student members in 160 active student branches, including 12 foreign student branches. The student branches host annual conferences.

The AIAA Foundation is devoted to the education of both practicing and future aerospace professionals. The AIAA Foundation funds numerous scholarships for both undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduate scholarships range from $2,000 to $2,500. Graduate scholarships are $5,000 or $10,000.

== Awards and lectureships delivered ==
=== Awards ===

<text>Peter Shand Kydd (23 April 1925 – 23 March 2006) was the stepfather of Diana, Princess of Wales, and an heir to the wallpaper fortune built by his father Norman Shand Kydd (1895–1962). His mother was Frances Madalein Foy (1900–1983), whose uncle was the Australian businessman Mark Foy. He was half-brother to champion amateur jockey William Shand Kydd (1937–2014), who was the husband of Christina Muriel Duncan, sister of Veronica Bingham, Countess of Lucan.

==Marriages==
He married Janet Munro Kerr, granddaughter of John Martin Munro Kerr. He sold the family business in 1962 and moved his family to Australia, where he became a sheep farmer.

After selling the farm and returning to England, and still married, he began an affair with Diana&#x27;s mother (Frances) Viscountess Althorp. She was married to John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, later 8th Earl Spencer. They both divorced, and then were free to marry each other, which they did on 2 May 1969. He thus became stepfather to her four children, including Diana, although the Viscount eventually won the bitter custody battle. They lived in Buckinghamshire and West Itchenor, West Sussex, finally settling on a 1,000 acre (4 km2) farm on the remote Scottish island of Seil. The couple separated in June 1988. Frances blamed the pressure of media attention, following the rise to fame of Diana, for the breakdown of the marriage.

In 1993, Shand Kydd married Marie-Pierre Palmer (&quot;née&quot; Bécret),&lt;ref name=&quot;standard/7231369&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary/a0117653046&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who ran a champagne-importing business in London, which lasted until April 1995.

== Descendants ==
By his first wife, Shand Kydd had three children. Their elder son, Adam Shand Kydd, was born in 1954 and became a novelist, before dying in Cambodia in 2004. His youngest son is John Shand Kydd.

==Death==
Peter Shand Kydd died on 23 March 2006, aged 80. He was buried on 6 April 2006 in Aldeburgh, Suffolk.

<text>The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know about America&#x27;s Economic Future (2004) is a book by Laurence J. Kotlikoff and Scott Burns.

In the Prologue on page xii, the authors say the United States was &quot;heading into one God-awful fiscal storm, the full dimensions of which are hard to fathom.&quot; Further, they say on page xiii the book offers suggestions for United States public policy and personal finance to help deflect the &quot;storm&quot;. Moreover, they state:

:&quot;We feel we have some unique insights into the demographic and economic problems facing our country based on our own research and that of other economists and financial analysts. Our goal is to leave you with a real sense of what&#x27;s coming, why it&#x27;s coming, when it&#x27;s coming, and where national and personal economic salvation does and does not lie.&quot;

&quot;Averting America&#x27;s Bankruptcy with a New New Deal&quot;, published by &quot;The Economists&#x27; Voice&quot; - February 2006, outlined some of the solutions promoted in the book. Kotlikoff also discusses his book in the Tax Foundation&#x27;s podcast titled &quot;Laurence J. Kotlikoff on Long-Term Fiscal Problems in the U.S.&quot;.

<text>José Sotero Hidalgo Laurel III, (August 27, 1914 – January 6, 2003) was a Filipino diplomat and the aide-de-camp of President Jose P. Laurel during the World War II period. He later became ambassador of the Philippines to Japan.

==Early life==
He was born on August 27, 1914. He mastered the Japanese language and culture in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy from 1934 to 1937. He served as a junior aide-de-camp to President Manuel L. Quezon from 1937-1940.
Beginning in March 1945, Laurel, together with his family, Camilo Osías, Benigno Aquino Sr., Gen. Tomas Capinpin, and Jorge B. Vargas evacuated to Baguio. Shortly after the city fell, they traveled to Tuguegarao, where they embarked a bomber plane to Japan via Formosa (now Taiwan) and Shanghai, China. Alongside his father and Aquino, he was taken into U.S. custody on September 15, 1945, days after the Japanese forces formally surrendered to the United States. They were imprisoned in Yokohama until they were transferred to Sugamo Prison on November 16. On July 23, 1946, they left Tokyo for Manila, having been turned over to the Republic of the Philippines.

==Career==
Laurel was admitted to the Philippine bar on June 10, 1950.

From 1966 to 1971, Laurel served as ambassador of the Philippines to Japan.

In 1976, Laurel initiated the Philippine Federation of Japan Alumni (PHILFEJA), a congregation of former students who graduated in Japanese colleges and universities including grantees of training programs. The association aims to strengthen Philippine-Japan relationship through educational and professional exchanges. He was also active in the Laurel Law Office up to his later years.

==Death==
Laurel died on January 6, 2003, at the age of 88 due to pneumonia. His remains were cremated.

==Personal life==
He is the second of nine siblings. He is the son of José P. Laurel with his wife Pacencia Laurel and brother to Jose Jr., Salvador and Sotero Laurel II. He was married to Beatrice Castillo-Laurel with children, including José Laurel V (former Governor of Batangas and former ambassador of the Philippines to Japan) and Ma. Elena Laurel-Loinaz (former president of the Philippine-Japan Ladies Association). He also had 23 grandchildren.

<doc id="704690" wikidata="Q523120" url="?curid=704690" title="Donald Maclean (spy)">
<text>Donald Duart Maclean (; 25 May 1913 – 6 March 1983) was a British diplomat and Soviet double agent who participated in the Cambridge Five spy ring. After being recruited by a Soviet agent as an undergraduate student, Maclean entered the civil service. In 1938, he was appointed as Third Secretary at the British embassy in Paris. He served in London and Washington, D.C., achieving promotion to First Secretary. He was subsequently posted to Egypt, and then was appointed head of the American Department in the Foreign Office. 

The Soviets helped Maclean to defect from London to Moscow in 1951. In Moscow, he worked as a specialist on British policy and on relations between the Soviet Union and NATO. He died there on 6 March 1983.

==Childhood and school==

Born in Marylebone, London, Donald Duart Maclean was the son of Sir Donald Maclean and Gwendolen Margaret Devitt. Following the 1918 general election, in which Liberal Party leader H. H. Asquith lost his seat, Maclean&#x27;s father Sir Donald was chosen as chairman of the rump of the 23 independent Liberal MPs who backed Asquith in the House of Commons. As the Labour Party had no leader and Sinn Féin did not attend, he became titular Leader of the Opposition. Maclean&#x27;s parents had houses in London (later in Buckinghamshire) as well as in the Scottish Borders, where his father represented Peebles and Southern Midlothian, but the family lived mostly in and around London. He grew up in a very political household, in which world affairs were constantly discussed. In 1931 his father entered the Coalition Cabinet as President of the Board of Education.

Maclean&#x27;s education began as a boarder at St Ronan&#x27;s School, Worthing. At the age of 13, he was sent to Gresham&#x27;s School in Norfolk, where he remained from 1926 until 1931, when he was 18. At Gresham&#x27;s, some of his contemporaries were Jack Simon (later Baron Simon, a Law Lord), James Klugmann (1912–1977), Roger Simon (1913–2002), Benjamin Britten (1913–1976) and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin (later a scientist and Nobel Laureate).

Gresham&#x27;s was considered to be a school both liberal and progressive. It had already produced Tom Wintringham (1898–1949), a Marxist military historian, journalist, author and one of the founders of the Communist Party of Great Britain and editor of various party journals and newspapers. James Klugmann and Roger Simon both went with Maclean to Cambridge University and joined the Communist Party at around the same time. Klugmann became the official historian of the British Communist Party, while Simon was later a left-wing Labour peer.

When Maclean was 16, his father was elected for the North Cornwall constituency, and he spent some time in Cornwall during vacations.

==Cambridge==
From Gresham&#x27;s, Maclean won a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, arriving in 1931 to read Modern Languages. He played rugby for his college through the winter of 1932–33. In Maclean&#x27;s second year at Cambridge his father died. Maclean&#x27;s political views grew much more apparent in the following years in light of &quot;his admiring, if sometimes puzzled, mother&quot;. In his final years in college Maclean had become a campus figure, many knowing that he was a communist. In the winter of 1933–34 he wrote a book review for &quot;Cambridge Left&quot;, to which other leading communists contributed, such as John Cornford, Charles Madge and the Irish scientist, J. D. Bernal. Donald reviewed &quot;Contemporary Literature and Social Revolution&quot; by J. D. Charques, praising the book for its readiness &quot;to hint at a Marxist conception of literature&quot;. In 1934, he became the editor of the &quot;Silver Crescent&quot;, the Trinity Hall students&#x27; magazine. His editorials stressed the decline in world trade, rearmament and arms trafficking. In one article, he insisted: &quot;England is in the throes of a capitalist crisis...If the analysis in the &quot;Editorial: A Personal&quot; is correct, there is an excellent reason why everyone of military age should start thinking about politics.&quot; In a letter to &quot;Granta&quot; he ascribed the demand for a democratically elected student council, equality for female students and rights to use college premises for political meetings.

In 1934, his last year at Cambridge, Maclean became an agent of the Soviet Union&#x27;s People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, abbreviated from the Russian as NKVD recruited by Arnold Deutsch. He was then instructed to give up political activity and enter the Diplomatic Service. He graduated with a first in Modern Languages. After spending a year preparing for the Civil Service examinations, Maclean passed with first-class honours. At the Final Board, Maclean was asked by one of the panel interviewing him, whether he had favoured communism while a university student, ostensibly because the panel knew of a trip he had taken to Moscow in his second year at Cambridge. Maclean said: &quot;At Cambridge, I was initially favourable to it but I am little by little getting disenchanted with it.&quot; His apparent sincerity satisfied members of the panel, which included a family friend, Lady Violet Bonham Carter.

==London==
In August 1935, Maclean was duly admitted to the diplomatic service. In October, he started work at the Foreign Office, and was assigned to the Western department, which dealt with the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland, as well as the League of Nations. In 1936, Maclean became closely involved in the work of the Non-Intervention Committee set up to monitor the activities of the chief powers, Germany, Italy, and the USSR and their involvement in determining the outcome of the Spanish Civil War.

In the summer of 1937, for a time, multiple occasions passed when no one showed to meet Maclean. Then Kitty Harris (wife of the Communist Party of the USA&#x27;s party leader Earl Browder) arrived in place of his usual controller and gave the recognition phrase. &quot;You hadn&#x27;t expected to see a lady, had you?&quot; she said. &quot;No, but it&#x27;s a pleasant surprise&quot;, he replied. Maclean would visit Harris&#x27;s flat in Bayswater after work, with documents to photograph. Over the next two years, 45 boxes of documents were photographed and sent to Moscow. &quot;She was a cut-out between Maclean and his NKVD controller&quot;, said Geoffrey Elliott, who wrote a book about her with Igor Damaskin, a former KGB officer.

==Paris==
On 24 September 1938, Maclean took up a post as Third Secretary at the British embassy in Paris. In the spring of 1939, an Anglo-French attempt was made to include the Soviet Union into the &quot;peace front&quot; that was intended to deter German aggression. Because of the French involvement in these Moscow negotiations, the telegrams passing between embassies allowed Maclean access to much information. Maclean kept Moscow informed in regard to relations between Germany and the British Empire, on the one hand, and Britain and France on the other, as the French foreign minister Georges Bonnet worked to end French security commitments in Eastern Europe. He also kept Moscow informed about the development of Anglo-French plans for intervention in the war between Finland and the Soviet Union.

In December 1939, Maclean met Melinda Marling, the daughter of a Chicago oil executive. She was a teenager when her parents had divorced, her mother moving to Europe. In October 1929, Melinda and her sisters went to school at Vevey, near Lausanne, where their mother rented a villa, and spent their holidays at Juan-les-Pins in France. Melinda&#x27;s mother moved to New York, marrying Charles Dunbar, an executive in the paper industry, and brought her daughters to live with them in Manhattan, where Melinda attended the Spence School. After graduation she spent some months in New York City then returned to Paris, where she enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris to study French literature. Mark Culme-Seymour later described her as &quot;quite pretty and vivacious, but rather reserved. I thought that she was a bit prim. She was always well-groomed, lipstick bright, hair permed, a double row of pearls around her neck. Her interests seemed limited to family, friends, clothes and Hollywood movies.&quot;

In the 1950s, Culme-Seymour tracked down the exiled Macleans in Moscow, and another Melinda emerged. She told him that she knew she would be going to Russia right from the beginning, even before Maclean defected.

Soviet archives confirm this view. As Maclean told Harris, on the evening he met Marling, he saw more to her: &quot;I was very taken by her views. She&#x27;s a liberal, she&#x27;s in favour of the Popular Front and doesn&#x27;t mind mixing with communists even though her parents are well-off. There was a White Russian girl, one of her friends, who attacked the Soviet Union and Melinda went for her. We found we spoke the same language.&quot; Maclean had told Marling about his role as a spy. He told Harris that Marling not only reacted positively, but &quot;actually promised to help me to the extent that she can – and she is well connected in the American community&quot;.

On 10 June 1940, as the German Army approached Paris, Maclean and a pregnant Marling were married at the local &quot;mairie&quot;. The British Embassy was evacuated, and the Macleans drove south with one of Donald&#x27;s colleagues. They were able to escape France on a small merchant ship, and went to London.

==London during the Second World War==
Maclean was assigned by the British Foreign Office to work on economic warfare matters. Maclean became one of the Foreign Office&#x27;s experts on economic warfare, civil air matters, military base negotiations and natural resources useful in the war, such as tungsten. In 1940 Walter Krivitsky, who had defected from Soviet military intelligence spymaster revealed information about Soviet espionage to MI5. Krivitsky may have given clues to the identity of Maclean that were not followed up.

Three days before Christmas 1940, Melinda Maclean went to New York to have her baby, which died shortly after its birth. Some weeks later she flew back to London and went to work in the BBC bookstore. Donald Maclean was promoted and given the prestigious assignment as Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Washington. Towards the end of April 1944, the Macleans set sail in convoy for New York, where they arrived on 6 May.

==Washington==
Maclean served in Washington from 1944 to 1948, achieving promotion to First Secretary. In 1944 Melinda Maclean was again pregnant, giving birth to a son in New York City. The Macleans frequently visited Melinda Maclean&#x27;s mother and stepfather in Manhattan and at Dunbar&#x27;s country place in the Berkshires. They vacationed on Long Island and Cape Cod with Mrs. Dunbar and Melinda Maclean&#x27;s sisters.

The Macleans became part of the liberal Georgetown social set in Washington, which included Katharine Graham, as well as participating in the diplomatic life of the city.

Maclean went to New York on a weekly basis. Maclean was considered to be an exceptionally hard worker at the embassy as his fellow diplomat Robert Cecil remembered in 1989: &quot;No task was too hard for him; no hours were too long. He gained the reputation of one who would always take over a tangled skein from a colleague who was sick, or going on leave, or simply less zealous. In this way he was able to manoeuvre himself into the hidden places that were of the most interest to the NKVD&quot;.

Towards the end of that period Maclean acted as Secretary of the Combined Policy Committee on atomic energy matters. He was Moscow&#x27;s main source of information about US/UK/Canada atomic energy policy development. Although Maclean did not transmit technical data on the atom bomb, he reported on its development and progress, particularly the amount of plutonium (used in the Fat Man bombs) available to the United States. As the British representative on the American–British–Canadian Council on the sharing of atomic secrets, he was able to provide the Soviet Union with information from Council meetings. This gave Soviet scientists the ability to predict the number of bombs that could be built by the Americans. In addition to atomic energy matters, Maclean&#x27;s responsibilities at the Washington embassy included civil aviation, bases, post-hostilities planning, Turkey and Greece, NATO and Berlin.

==Cairo==

In 1948 Maclean was appointed Head of Chancery at the British Embassy in Cairo. He was at that time the youngest Counsellor in the British Foreign Service. As soon as he arrived Maclean began to have problems with his KGB contact, who arranged their meetings in an unsatisfactory manner. Maclean suggested that Melinda should pass his information to the wife of the Soviet resident at the hairdresser&#x27;s and Modin reported that &quot;Melinda was quite prepared to do this.&quot;

Cairo was an important post, the key to British power in the area and a central point in Anglo-American planning for pre-emptive war with the Soviet Union. At this time Britain was the major power in the Middle East with troops in both the Canal Zone and nearby Palestine and airbases in the Canal Zone from which American atomic bombers could reach the Soviet Union. In regard to Egypt itself, British policy was one of laissez-faire or non-interference with the corruption surrounding King Farouk. Maclean disagreed strongly and felt that Britain should encourage reform which alone, in his opinion, could save the country from communism. &quot;And, except to stress its dangers, that was all I ever heard Donald say about communism,&quot; recalled Geoffrey Hoare, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; Cairo correspondent.

Maclean was considered the key official in the Cairo Embassy, specifically responsible for coordinating US/UK war planning and, under the Ambassador, relations with the Egyptian government. By now, his double life was beginning to affect Maclean. He began drinking, brawling and talking about his double life. After a drunken episode which resulted in the wrecking of an American embassy staffer&#x27;s apartment, Melinda told the ambassador that Donald was ill and needed leave to see a London doctor. It is possible that this series of events was contrived to provide a way for Maclean to return to England as American intelligence was getting close to identifying Maclean as a Soviet agent by means of the Venona messages. At this time Melinda Maclean was having an affair with an Egyptian aristocrat, with whom she travelled to Spain when Donald Maclean went to England.

==London deskbound==
After a few months&#x27; rest, Maclean recovered from the troubles of his Egyptian period and Melinda Maclean agreed to return to the marriage, immediately becoming pregnant. Maclean&#x27;s career did not seem to suffer from the events in Egypt. He was promoted and made head of the American Department in the Foreign Office, perhaps its most important assignment for an officer at Maclean&#x27;s level. This allowed him to continue to keep Moscow informed about Anglo-American relations and planning. The most important report Maclean sent to Moscow concerned the emergency summit in Washington in December 1950 between the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee and U.S. President Harry S. Truman. After China entered the Korean War, there were demands both outside and inside the U.S. government, most notably by General Douglas MacArthur, that the U.S attack China with nuclear weapons. The British were strongly opposed to both the use of nuclear weapons and escalating the war by attacking China, and Attlee had gone to Washington with the aim of stopping both. Truman reassured Attlee at the Washington summit that he would not allow the use of nuclear weapons or take the war outside of Korea. Maclean provided a transcript of what was said at the Truman-Attlee summit to Yuri Modin, the &quot;control&quot; of the Cambridge spy ring. Meanwhile, the American and British governments were concluding that Maclean was indeed a Soviet agent, a process carefully tracked by fellow Soviet operative Kim Philby in Washington.

The journalist Cyril Connolly vividly described what he had seen of Maclean in London 1951: &quot;He had lost his serenity, his hands would tremble, his face was usually a livid yellow...he was miserable and in a very bad way. In conversation, a kind of shutter would fall as if he had returned to some basic and incommunicable anxiety.&quot;

==Detection==
Maclean&#x27;s role was discovered when the VENONA decryption was carried out at Arlington Hall, Virginia and Eastcote in London between 1945 and 1951. These related to coded messages between New York, Washington and Moscow for which Soviet code clerks had re-used one-time pads. The cryptanalysts working as part of the Venona project, discovered that twelve coded cables had been sent, six from New York from June to September 1944 and six from Washington in April 1945, by an agent named Gomer. The first cable sent but not the first to be deciphered described a meeting with Sergei on 25 June and Gomer&#x27;s forthcoming trip to New York where his wife was living with her mother awaiting the birth of a child. This was decoded in April 1951. A short list of nine men was identified as possible Homers (Gomer is the Russian form of Homer), one of whom was Maclean.

The second cable on 2–3 August 1944 was a description, but not a transcript, of a message from Churchill to Roosevelt, which Homer claimed to have decrypted. It suggested that Churchill was trying to persuade Roosevelt to abandon plans for Operation Anvil, the invasion of Provence, in favour of an attack through Venice and Trieste into Austria. This was typical of Churchill&#x27;s strategic thinking since he was always looking for a flanking move. But it was rejected outright by both American and British generals.

Shortly after the VENONA investigation began, Kim Philby, another member of the Cambridge Five, was assigned to Washington, serving as Britain&#x27;s CIA–FBI–NSA liaison. He saw the VENONA material, and recognised that Maclean was Homer, which was confirmed by his KGB control.

Believing that Maclean would confess to MI5, Philby and Guy Burgess decided that Burgess would travel to London, where Maclean was head of the Foreign Office&#x27;s American desk, to warn him. Burgess contrived to receive three speeding tickets in a single day in Virginia. The Governor of Virginia complained to the British Ambassador and Burgess went back to London, as planned.

The Soviets were desperate for Maclean to get out of London, fearful that in his then state he would crack immediately under interrogation. Donald Maclean discussed the possible defection with Melinda Maclean. According to Modin, she responded: &quot;They&#x27;re quite right – go as soon as you can, don&#x27;t waste a single moment.&quot;

==Defection==
The day eventually earmarked for Maclean to make his escape happened to be his 38th birthday: 25 May 1951, a Friday. He came home by train from the Foreign Office to his home in Surrey as usual that evening, and soon afterwards Guy Burgess turned up. After eating the birthday supper that Melinda had prepared, Maclean said goodbye to his wife and children; he and Burgess then got into Burgess&#x27;s car, and left. They drove to Southampton, took a ferry to France, then disappeared from view, sparking a press and intelligence furore. It was five years before Khrushchev confirmed that they were in the Soviet Union.

On the Monday after Maclean&#x27;s departure, Melinda Maclean telephoned the Foreign Office to ask if her husband was there. Her pose of total ignorance convinced them: MI5 put off interviewing her for nearly a week, and the Macleans&#x27; house was never searched. Three weeks after Maclean left she gave birth to their third child, a daughter. Francis Marling, Melinda&#x27;s father, flew from New York to help. Friends in the State Department gave him Foreign Office contacts who proved unhelpful. He returned to New York with a low opinion of Foreign Office officials.

==Moscow==
Maclean, unlike Burgess, assimilated into the Soviet Union and became a respected citizen, learning Russian, receiving a doctorate, and serving as a specialist on the economic policy of the West and British foreign affairs. In February 1956, the presence of Maclean and Burgess in Moscow was publicly revealed following an interview with Sydney Weiland, a Reuters correspondent, and Richard Hughes of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, though a statement issued by the Soviet press agency TASS denied that Burgess and Maclean had ever been spies, claiming that they had gone behind the Iron Curtain to &quot;further understanding between East and West&quot; for the sake of world peace.

After a brief period teaching English at a school in Kuybyshev (now Samara), Maclean joined the staff of &quot;International Affairs&quot; in early 1956 as a specialist on British home and foreign policy, and relations between the Soviet Union and NATO. He briefly shared a small room with his new Soviet colleagues on the second floor of the magazine&#x27;s premises on . He then worked for the Soviet Foreign Ministry and IMEMO, the Institute of World Economy and International Relations.

Maclean was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Combat. His publications for IMEMO were under the name of S. Madzoevsky. It has been claimed that in the 1970s Maclean used his prestige with the KGB to protect members of the early dissident movement. He seems to have had some contact with Andrei Sakharov and with Roy and Zhores Medvedev. Shortly before his death, he wrote a critique of the retrograde development of Soviet society.

Melinda Maclean and their children joined Maclean in Moscow more than a year after his defection.

==Extramarital affairs and later family life==
The Macleans had three surviving children: Fergus, born in 1944, Donald, in 1946, and Melinda, in 1951. The Maclean marriage came under pressure in Moscow, for Donald Maclean continued until the mid-1960s to drink heavily, becoming violent when drunk. Kim Philby and Melinda Maclean became lovers during a ski trip in 1964, while Eleanor Philby, Philby&#x27;s American wife, was on an extended visit to the US. Maclean found out and broke with Philby. Eleanor Philby discovered the affair on her return, and left Moscow for good. Melinda moved in with Philby in 1966, but within three years tired of him and left. She left Moscow for good in 1979. Melinda Maclean returned to the West to be with her mother and sisters; her children soon followed her. She died in New York in 2010 without saying a single word to the media.

Two of the Maclean children married Russians and left Moscow to live in London and the U.S, as they still had the right to British or American passports. Fergus, the eldest son, enrolled at University College London in 1974, prompting a question in Parliament. Together with her second husband, Maclean&#x27;s daughter left for the United States, along with her daughter, Maclean&#x27;s granddaughter. Maclean&#x27;s son, Donald, married firstly Lucy, daughter of George Hanna, an English man who worked for the BBC and was a friend of the family. They had a son, Donald&#x27;s only grandson (born in 1970), who resides in the UK.

==Death==
Maclean was reported seriously ill with pneumonia in December 1982, and was housebound after his recovery. The Institute of World Economy and International Relations, Maclean&#x27;s workplace, reported his death at the age of 69 on 6 March 1983. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered on his parents&#x27; grave in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Penn, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. Twenty years previously, Guy Burgess&#x27; ashes had also been scattered on his family grave in England.

In its obituary of &quot;Donald Donaldovich Maclean&quot;, &quot;Izvestia&quot; described him as &quot;a man of high moral qualities and a convinced communist&quot; who &quot;devoted all his conscious life to the high ideals of social progress and humanism&quot; and &quot;who performed outstanding services to the Soviet state&quot;. At the time of his death, Maclean had been working at the Institute, &quot;a government think-tank, as a foreign policy analyst&quot; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Legacy==
In May 1970, Hodder &amp; Stoughton published Maclean&#x27;s book &quot;British Foreign Policy since Suez&quot; which he wrote for a British readership. Maclean told journalists that he set out to analyse the subject rather than to attack it, but criticised British diplomatic support for the United States in the Vietnam War. He stated that he would donate the British royalties to the British Committee for Medical Aid to Vietnam. He foresaw a strengthening of British influence in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of economic recovery. Interviewed live by a BBC Radio reporter who detected a nostalgia for Britain in the book, Maclean refused to be drawn on whether he would like to return to London, for further research for his next book.

Of the five spies that made up the Cambridge Spy Ring, Maclean was not the best known, but, according to some, he provided the most intelligence of value to the Soviet Union as his position as a senior diplomat in the Foreign Office gave access to more information than what could be accessed by Philby, Cairncross, Blunt or Burgess as he was able to provide the Soviets with &quot;the most intimate details&quot; of Anglo-American decision-making on such matters as the future of nuclear energy and the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In an official American appraisal concluded: &quot;In the fields of US/UK/Canada planning on atomic energy, US/UK post-war planning and policy in Europe, all information up the date of Maclean&#x27;s defection undoubtedly reached Soviet hands&quot;.

Headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, it serves Moore, Lee, Chatham, Orange, Durham, Wake, and Johnston counties. In 2023, TJCOG underwent a rebranding and name change, and is now known as CPRC.

==History==
The CPRC was originally established in 1959 by the Research Triangle Foundation as the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission. The commission&#x27;s original members were Durham, Orange and Wake counties, and the cities of Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh.

When the North Carolina General Assembly established 18 regional planning councils in 1972, the Research Triangle Regional Planning Commission was reorganized as the planning council for Region J, which consisted of Durham, Orange, Wake, Chatham, Johnston and Lee counties. Moore County was added when the planning commission for Region H was abolished.

<doc id="704701" wikidata="Q4864483" url="?curid=704701" title="Barry McCaffrey">
<text>Barry Richard McCaffrey (born 17 November 1942) is a retired United States Army general and current news commentator, professor and business consultant who served in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Cabinet as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. He received three Purple Heart medals for injuries sustained during his service in the Vietnam War, two Silver Stars, and two Distinguished Service Crosses—the second-highest United States Army award for valor. He was inducted into United States Army Ranger Hall of Fame at the United States Army Infantry Center at Fort Benning in 2007.

McCaffrey served as an adjunct professor at the United States Military Academy and was its Bradley Professor of International Security Studies from 2001 to 2008. He received West Point Association of Graduates of the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Distinguished Graduate Award in 2010. He is currently a paid military analyst for NBC and MSNBC as well as president of his own consulting firm, BR McCaffrey Associates. He serves on many boards of directors of national corporations. He is an outspoken advocate for insurance parity, for drug courts, and veterans&#x27; courts; he is a frequent speaker at conferences. In March 2018 he claimed that United States president Donald Trump was under the sway of Russian President Vladimir Putin and that it was a dangerous threat for the security of the United States.

==Early life and education==
McCaffrey graduated from Phillips Academy in 1960 and the United States Military Academy in 1964. He received a Master of Arts in civil government from American University in 1970 and attended Harvard University&#x27;s National Security Program and Business School Executive Education Program. While on active duty McCaffrey attended the United States Army War College, the Command and General Staff College, the Defense Language Institute&#x27;s program in Vietnamese, and the Armor School Advanced Course.

==Military career==
Following his graduation from West Point, McCaffrey was commissioned into the infantry. His combat tours included action in the Dominican Republic with 82nd Airborne Division in 1965, advisory duty with Army of the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1967, and company command with 1st Cavalry Division from 1968 to 1969. During the course of his service, he was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart three times for wounds sustained in combat, and the Silver Star twice.

McCaffrey&#x27;s peacetime assignments included tours as an instructor at United States Military Academy from 1972 to 1975, Assistant Commandant at the United States Army Infantry School; Deputy United States Representative to NATO; Assistant to the chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); and Director of Strategic Plans and Policy, Joint Chiefs of Staff.

===&quot;Left Hook&quot; attack===

During Operation Desert Storm, McCaffrey commanded the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). Under his command, the division conducted the &quot;left hook&quot; attack into Iraq, leading to decisive battle victory in the Gulf War and also putting troops in place for the final battle of the war.

In his book &quot;Prodigal Soldiers&quot;, James Kitfield recounted McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;left hook&quot; attack plan. McCaffrey commanded &quot;two entire Army corps deep into Iraqi territory. If successful, and no army in history had ever moved a force that size over on the time line General H. Norman Schwarzkopf was reciting, the move would flank the Republican Guard divisions in Kuwait and cut off all avenues of retreat... The briefing left McCaffrey slightly stunned. He was part of the flanking force, and his mind was already starting to race over a logistics problem the war colleges would call a potential war-stopper, yet he had one overriding thought: We&#x27;re not going to fight a war of attrition, or a limited war. It was a revelation. He saw now that the Army was going to play to its strengths and the enemy&#x27;s weakness. By God, we learned. We learned (from the lessons of Vietnam).&quot;

In their book &quot;The Generals&#x27; War: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf&quot;, Michael R. Gordon and General Bernard E. Trainor wrote more about the &quot;left hook&quot; attack:

It was the largest air assault in Army history and gave the (French 6th) Division a staging area for launching attacks in western Iraq and attacking Highway 8, the east-west route along the Euphrates (River).

Racing ahead with his fuel trucks, McCaffrey&#x27;s division was roaring northward, with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment providing protection to its flank. McCaffrey was speeding toward the Euphrates River at a remarkable 30 miles an hour over rocky terrain. McCaffrey was hurrying to link up with Peay&#x27;s 101st, cut Highway 8, and then turn east to attack the Republican Guard...

As dawn broke, Rhame&#x27;s 1st Mechanized Infantry Division cleared lanes through the minefields and, instead of sending troops to clear the trenches of Iraqi soldiers, Rhame sent bulldozers to plow over the trench line, entombing any Iraqis who resisted or were too slow to surrender.

The armored bulldozers were not a novel killing machine. They were used in both World War II and Vietnam for the same purpose. Nor were they more brutal than the pounding the Iraqi front lines took from artillery, tons of bombs, fuel-air explosives, and napalm used by allied forces. The divisions efforts to publicize its exploits after the war backfired when news reports said that thousands of Iraqi troops may have been buried alive. A classified log prepared by the division officers at the time, however, put the number of Iraqis buried at 150, and after the war, the Iraqis managed to unearth only several dozen bodies...

On the morning of 27 February, Barry McCaffrey flew to Jalibah airfield to meet with his commanders. Located 30 miles south of Highway 8, the east-west road that ran to Basra, Jalibah had been one of Iraq&#x27;s main airfields during the war. But now it was pockmarked with the burned and twisted wreckage of Iraqi MiG-29s and other fighters that McCaffrey&#x27;s 24th Division had blasted in a four-hour fight to seize the airfield.

After leaving his helicopter, the general made his way over to Col. Paul Kern, the commander of the division&#x27;s 2nd brigade. Kern had deployed his command post–two M-577 armored personnel carriers full of communications equipment–within a protective cordon of M1 tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, which guarded the perimeter of the airfield.

No general was more aggressive than McCaffrey. He had been badly wounded in Vietnam, but it had not shaken his confidence or his ardor for battle. Unlike the VII Corps planners, McCaffrey was not in awe of the Iraqis. Dug into their fighting holes and with no air force to protect them, the Iraqi army was like a bunch of &#x27;tethered goats,&#x27; McCaffrey recalled after the war.

Schwarzkopf had a soft spot for the general, who commanded his old unit. Just before McCaffrey&#x27;s division moved to its attack positions in the Saudi desert, Schwarzkopf flew up to give a pep talk to one of the division&#x27;s reconnaissance teams. Before returning to his helicopter, Schwarzkopf grabbed McCaffrey by his uniform. With tears welling in his eyes, the commander said to McCaffrey that once the ground war started, there would be no stopping until the Army had destroyed the Republican Guard. President (George H. W.) Bush has assured Schwarzkopf of that. That moment was chiseled in McCaffrey&#x27;s memory.

When it came time to launch the ground war, McCaffrey issued a top secret attack order that seemed like a call to a holy war and alluded to the assurance he had received from Schwarzkopf. &quot;Soldiers of the Victory Division–we now begin a great battle to destroy an aggressor army and free two million Kuwaiti people,&quot; the order read. &quot;We will fight under the American flag and with the authority of the United Nations. By force of arms, we will make the Iraqi war machine surrender the country they hold prisoner. There will be no turning back when we attack into battle.&quot;

A subsequent Rand Corporation report, &quot;Technology&#x27;s Child: Schwarzkopf and Operation Desert Storm,&quot; further described the battle plan:

Since Saddam had most of his forces in southern Kuwait and along the Gulf coast to the east, the ground plan called for moving VII Corps several hundred miles in a wide arc to the west, and attacking through Iraq to hit the Republican Guard. It would amount to a gigantic left hook. Massive, swift, crushing tank attacks were central to the plan... The idea was to force Saddam to move his hundreds of thousands of troops from dug-in positions so they could be picked-off with superior US air and ground fire... For deception, Schwarzkopf instructed XVIII Airborne Corps and VII Corps to maintain their forces in assembly areas near Kuwait, to keep Iraqi forces focused on those two avenues of approach. As soon as the air war began, the Iraqis would be pinned down and both corps would shift laterally several hundred miles to the west without interference... The ground war lasted just 100 hours before President Bush, in consultation with his military commanders, called a halt. Of 42 Iraqi divisions in the theater at the beginning of the war, 27 were destroyed and an additional six were rendered combat-ineffective. However, (more than) half the Republican Guard, including the nearly intact Hammurabi Division, escaped the enveloping &quot;left hook,&quot; leaving a legacy of controversy about whether General Frederick Franks&#x27; VII Corps had moved quickly enough. When the Iraqis finally fled from Kuwait, they jammed the road north out of the city with vehicles and booty, which the coalition air power then blocked and savaged. The vivid descriptions of the resulting carnage were probably a significant factor in the decision to halt military operations., extensively quoting from &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Take A Hero&quot;, the autobiography of General Schwarzkopf with Peter Petre.

Describing the &quot;left hook&quot; battle plan and its aftermath, Schwarzkopf and Petre wrote, &quot;General McCaffrey&#x27;s mission was to leapfrog his units north and to occupy an 80-mile-by-60-mile zone with the Marines digging in around Al Jubayl. General J. H. Binford Peay III was to establish bases along McCaffrey&#x27;s left flank, from which his helicopters and troops could defend a 100-mile arc of desert to the north and west. A brigade of the 101st would also serve temporarily as a screen, ranging forward of the U.S. positions to detect, delay, and disrupt any enemy attack. Eventually, Colonel Doug Starr&#x27;s 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment would arrive to take over that mission... On Saturday morning, 2 March 1991, two days after the shooting supposedly had stopped, I came into the war room (in Riyadh) to discover that we&#x27;d just fought a major battle in the Euphrates valley. Evidently, two battalions of the Republican Guard had gotten tired of waiting to cross the pontoon bridge at Basra the night before and had headed west on Highway 8. Twice, they&#x27;d encountered Bradley Fighting Vehicles operating as scouts for the 24th Mech(anized Division, under McCaffrey&#x27;s command) and both times had opened fire with antitank missiles. At dawn, they&#x27;d run into a U.S. blocking position and had opened fire again. McCaffrey had replied with a full-scale tank and helicopter counterattack, smashing the Iraqi column and taking 3,000 prisoners without suffering a single casualty. To me, this wasn&#x27;t altogether bad news: the Republican Guard had shown characteristic arrogance by spotting what looked like a weak U.S. force–not suspecting that an entire U.S. Army division was in the way–and deciding, &quot;Let&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up.&quot; I was glad that the President&#x27;s cease-fire statement had reserved our forces the right to shoot back if attacked. Yet the incident underscored the urgency of setting cease-fire terms that would definitively separate the two sides.&quot;

On 27 February 1991, &quot;C-SPAN&quot; documented the terms of President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s cease-fire statement, including the terms of engagement:

With the remarks, &quot;Kuwait is liberated. Iraq&#x27;s army has been defeated,&quot; President Bush began his announcement to the nation on the U.S. and coalition forces&#x27; victory in the Persian Gulf war. He cautioned against euphoria, but urged the nation to continue their support for the U.S. armed forces serving in the Middle East. He called for Iraq to release all coalition forces&#x27; P.O.W.&#x27;s and to comply with all United Nations resolutions concerning Kuwait. President Bush also announced a conditional cease-fire to take place at midnight, E.S.T., which is 8:00 A.M. Iraqi time. The cease-fire would allow Iraqi forces to return to Iraq from Kuwait as long as they did not fire upon coalition forces.

In a paper entitled &quot;Detecting Massed Troops with the French SPOT Satellites:
A Feasibility Study for Cooperative Monitoring,&quot; Vipin Gupta of Sandia National Laboratories and LTC George Harris, Commander, 250th Military Intelligence Battalion, extensively described and illustrated pre-battle and post-battle satellite images:
* &quot;The forward deployment positions and attack maneuvers of the coalition ground forces&quot; (a map from McCaffrey&#x27;s post-battle report, &quot;24th Infantry Division Ground Operations&quot;)
* &quot;Deployment of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division from its forward assembly area at As Sarrar to its pre-attack position at Nisab. 75% of the division&#x27;s tentage was left behind at As Sarrar in order to enhance the division&#x27;s attack mobility... (and) the role the 24th played in the left hook maneuver&quot; (also from McCaffrey&#x27;s report)
* &quot;Features identified in the 20 August 1990 SPOT image along the Saudi-Iraqi border near the towns of Nisab and Ash Shubah. The image was acquired three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait when no coalition forces were present in this area.&quot;
* &quot;Features identified in the 29 January 1991 SPOT image covering the same ground area... acquired one day after the US 24th Mechanized Infantry Division completed its deployment into the area&quot;
* &quot;20 August 1990 SPOT image around Ash Shubah town... (the) enhanced image clearly shows the town, Tapline Road, and oil pipeline. It also shows most of the Bedouin trails&quot;
* &quot;Enlargement of 29 January 1991 SPOT image around Ash Shubah town. Acquired two weeks after the initiation of Operation Desert Storm, the image shows numerous new encampments west of Ash Shubah as well as several single pixel features which were inferred to be small tents and vehicles. The enlargement also shows a new primary supply route and bypass road. The inset is a map section from the historical archives that show the specific units that were deployed near Ash Shubah&quot;
* &quot;Enlargement of 29 January 1991 SPOT image showing two fan shaped features in the open desert. Based on the layout and the trail patterns, the features were identified as firing ranges for mechanized units. The image shows the entrance at the central hub, the firing stations, and the direction of fire. The larger range could accommodate a mechanized company and the smaller range could accommodate a mechanized platoon&quot;
* &quot;Enlargement of 29 January 1991 SPOT image showing linear traces next to a north-south trail. The trace configuration is consistent with the appearance of vehicle lines positioned close together for protection, line-of-sight communication, and possible forward attack advancement&quot;

The paper concluded, &quot;The positive identification of troop positions was facilitated by the dramatic appearance of numerous secured encampments and the sudden disappearance of normal civilian traffic... The observation of the new, redundant trail network further suggested that the new inhabitants in the area were indeed military forces... After these forces were found, more detailed analysis revealed the logistical areas, training grounds, and troop positions. Each feature was identified from its topographic location, layout, configuration, and associated level of activity.&quot;

On 13 November 1993, CDR Daniel S. Zazworsky, USN, wrote an unclassified analysis of the &quot;left hook&quot; attack, saying, &quot;Major General McCaffrey, commander of the 24th Infantry Division (Mech), also recognized the importance of capturing enemy resources for his own forces use. On the leading edge of the left hook envelopment, he was bringing enough fuel with him in a huge logistics tail behind him. But he was hauling most of it in HEMTTs (heavy expanded-mobility tactical trucks) which themselves required huge amounts of fuel and, therefore, ordered his artillery gunners not to shoot Iraqi tank trucks or POL dumps or gas stations along the road. He told them &#x27;We just might need the fuel too, and anyone who blows it up will answer to me.&#x27; While there is certainly utility in capturing enemy resources, the brevity of the war left it unclear whether or not LTGEN William G. Pagonis&#x27; and General McCaffrey&#x27;s efforts would have been sufficient to enable the US to conduct a significantly prolonged offensive. Nor is it clear how useful enemy munitions and other equipment would have been. Perhaps General McCaffrey and Colonel Paul Kern, commander of 2nd Brigade, gave us a hint to the answer to that question. Within hours of locating a huge Iraqi stockpile of fuel-air bombs at Jalibah airfield inside Iraq, Kern had them destroyed. Later, McCaffrey indicated that it would take a week to destroy all the ammunition dumps and military supplies around the airfield... Destroying captured enemy munitions conveys the message that they were either not needed...or not wanted. Lt. Colonel Dave Oberthaler, Logistics Staff Officer with the 24th Infantry Division (Mech) in the KTO (Kuwaiti Theater of Operations), also raises a valid concern with regard to captured Iraq fuel, food and drink–indicating that fear of contamination would have kept U.S. forces from using them. He also points out another problem with relying on captured enemy equipment. Often the destruction of that enemy equipment is a high priority. For example, captured Iraqi transportation equipment (primarily HEMTTs), would have been very useful to U.S. ground forces. However, these units were also a top priority target for the coalition air forces.&quot;

===Allegations of war crimes===
In an opinion column published on 22 May 2000, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; entitled &quot;Annals of War: Overwhelming Force,&quot; Seymour Hersh wrote that McCaffrey, whose pre–1991 record he praised extensively, may according to an unnamed source have commanded his troops to kill retreating Iraq soldiers after the ceasefire had been declared and then failed to properly investigate reports of killings of unarmed persons and an alleged massacre of hundreds of Iraqi POWs. Hersh&#x27;s column quoted &quot;senior officers decrying the lack of discipline and proportionality in the McCaffrey-ordered attack.&quot; One colonel told Hersh that it &quot;made no sense for a defeated army to invite their own death... It came across as shooting fish in a barrel. Everyone was incredulous.&quot;

In the same issue of &quot;New Yorker&quot;, its editor-in-chief David Remnick wrote an editorial supporting Hersh&#x27;s research and conclusions. Remnick wrote, &quot;In Iraq, General McCaffrey led the 24th Infantry Division in an epic &#x27;left hook&#x27; tank drive, designed to shut off an Iraqi retreat from Kuwait. He and his troops won extraordinary praise for a four-day march under bleak conditions. Hersh, however, in the course of conducting hundreds of interviews and reviewing thousands of pages of government and Army documents, found a number of operations by men under McCaffrey&#x27;s command that are, at a minimum, unsettling. His detailed account, published here this week, describes how, on 2 March 1991—two days after the declaration of a ceasefire, when Iraqi forces were in flight—McCaffrey attacked a line of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops, unleashing an assault that lasted several hours and was all but uncontested. In testimony before the Senate and in written answers to questions from Hersh, whose repeated requests for an interview were declined, McCaffrey said that his men were fired on and he had no choice but to respond in force—with the full might of his division.&quot;

Remnick continued, &quot;Many military men have supported General McCaffrey&#x27;s version of events, but many officers and enlisted men who have talked to Hersh for the record say either that there was no Iraqi fire at all or that there was so little, and of such minor consequence, that it hardly warranted the onslaught–and bloodshed–that followed. The question is one of proportionality: Did an Army general, who is now, as it happens, in the President&#x27;s Cabinet, go too far?&quot;

Subsequently, an Army investigation cleared McCaffrey of any wrongdoing. Hersh dismissed the findings of the investigation, writing that &quot;few soldiers report crimes, because they don&#x27;t want to jeopardize their Army careers.&quot; Hersh describes his interview with Private First Class Charles Sheehan-Miles, who later published a novel about his experience in the Gulf: &quot;When I asked Sheehan-Miles why he fired, he replied, &#x27;At that point, we were shooting everything. Guys in the company told me later that some were civilians. It wasn&#x27;t like they came at us with a gun. It was that they were there—&#x27;in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#x27; Although Sheehan-Miles is unsure whether he and his fellow-tankers were ever actually fired upon during the war, he is sure that there was no significant enemy fire: &#x27;We took some incoming once, but it was friendly fire,&#x27; he said. &#x27;The folks we fought never had a chance.&#x27; He came away from Iraq convinced that he and his fellow-soldiers were, as another tanker put it, part of &#x27;the biggest firing squad in history.&#x27;&quot;

===McCaffrey&#x27;s and Colin Powell&#x27;s rebuttals to war crimes allegations===
McCaffrey denied the charges that on three occasions, he or his men of the 24th infantry division either fired on enemy soldiers who had surrendered in an &quot;unprovoked attack,&quot; or &quot;went too far&quot; in responding to a non-existent threat. He attacked what he called Hersh&#x27;s &quot;revisionist history&quot; of the Gulf War. BBC reported that &quot;General McCaffrey said an army investigation had previously cleared him of any blame, and he accused the &quot;New Yorker&quot; of maligning young soldiers... White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton felt the charges were unsubstantiated.&quot;

According to Georgie Anne Geyer of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; from May 2000, Hersh&#x27;s accusations were disputed by a number of military personnel, who later claimed to have been misquoted by the journalist. She argues that this may have been Hersh&#x27;s misguided attempt to break another My Lai story, and that he &quot;could not possibly like a man such as McCaffrey, who is so temperamentally and philosophically different from him.&quot; Finally, she suggests that Hersh may also have been motivated to attack the general for McCaffrey&#x27;s role as the drug czar.

Hersh also alleged that McCaffrey violated Department of Defense policy by denying reporters access to his battle plans and the actual battleground. In fact, however, McCaffrey welcomed famed war correspondent Joseph L. Galloway. On May 26, 2006, Knight Ridder Washington, D.C. bureau chief John Walcott, honored Galloway, saying, &quot;Mike Ruby, Merrill McLoughlin, and I sent Joe (Galloway) to Schwarzkopf&#x27;s headquarters in Riyadh with the kind of simple request that editors like to make: Go get the best seat in the war... General Schwarzkopf sent Joe to Maj. Gen. Barry McCaffrey&#x27;s 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), which he said had the most complex and dangerous assignment in his battle plan, the famous left hook. Almost as soon as he arrived at division headquarters, Joe was ushered into the TOC, the Tactical Operations Center. The cover was lifted off the division&#x27;s battle maps, which of course were Top Secret-and-change... Joe asked General McCaffrey why he could see the secret battle plan. &#x27;I trust you because Norm trusts you,&#x27; Barry replied, &#x27;but most of all, I trust you because you&#x27;re coming with us.&#x27;&quot;

Lieutenant General Steven Arnold, interviewed by Hersh for the article, was one of the officers who later claimed to have been misquoted. He wrote to the editor of the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, saying, &quot;I know that my brief comments in the article were not depicted in an entirely accurate manner and were taken out of context... When the Iraqi forces fired on elements of the 24th Infantry Division, they were clearly committing a hostile act. I regret having granted an interview with Mr. Hersh. The tone and thrust of the article places me in a position of not trusting or respecting General Barry McCaffrey, and nothing could be further from the truth.&quot;

Similar criticism of Hersh&#x27;s allegations came from General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Iraq War. In a May 2000 interview with Sam Donaldson for the television news program &quot;This Week&quot;, Powell described the Hersh article as &quot;attempted character assassination on General McCaffrey.&quot;

On 22 May 2000, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; discussed Hersh&#x27;s allegations, as did &quot;Newsweek&quot; on 29 May 2000. &quot;Five-Hour Air, Armor Assault—The March 2 attack on the Iraqi Republican Guard &#x27;Hammurabi&#x27; tank division is ordered by Army General Barry McCaffrey (the general who commanded the already-famous &#x27;left hook&#x27; maneuver days before—see 23 February 1991 and After), in response to what McCaffrey says is an attack on his forces with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The decision surprises some in the Allied command structure in Saudi Arabia and causes unease among civilian and military leaders in Washington, who worry about the public relations ramifications of an attack that comes days after a cease-fire was implemented (see 28 February 1991). McCaffrey himself later calls the attack &#x27;one of the most astounding scenes of destruction I have ever participated in.&#x27; The &#x27;Hammurabi&#x27; division is obliterated in the assault.&quot;

===Military career after the Gulf War===
McCaffrey&#x27;s last command in the army was United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), the unified command responsible for United States military activities in Central America and South America. He commanded SOUTHCOM, whose headquarters were then in the Republic of Panama, from 1994 to 1996. Besides managing military personnel, as part of his duties in Panama, McCaffrey supported humanitarian operations for over 10,000 Cuban refugees as part of Operation Safe Haven from 8 September 1994 – 15 March 1995 at Empire Range, Panama. It was also during his last military position that he created the first Human Rights Council and Human Rights Code of Conduct for U.S. Military Joint Command. He wrote in August 1995 in &quot;Human Rights and the Commander&quot; in &quot;Joint Force Quarterly&quot;, &quot;There is a common assumption that respect for an enemy&#x27;s soldiers and its civilian populace can stand in the way of a successful military campaign. Instead, respect for human rights increases the efficacy of security forces, both military and law enforcement.&quot;

McCaffrey was the youngest and most highly decorated four-star general in the army at the time of his retirement from the military in 1996.

On 1 June 1996, at the commencement ceremony at the United States Military Academy, Secretary of Defense William Perry commended McCaffrey&#x27;s performance during the Gulf War. Perry said, &quot;Whatever else is required of you in your Army career, you will first of all need to be a warrior. And you could find no better role model than Barry McCaffrey. Barry became one of America&#x27;s greatest warriors. He led forces into combat in Vietnam, where he was grievously wounded. In Desert Storm, General McCaffrey&#x27;s 24th Infantry Division led the famous left hook that caught the Iraqi army by surprise, and led America to one of its most convincing battlefield victories ever. He then went to SOUTHCOM at a crucial time and seized the opportunities presented by the ascendancy of democracy in our hemisphere. General McCaffery&#x27;s attributes as a warrior–guts, brains and tenacity–are key to success on today&#x27;s battlefield. Now he is putting those same skills to work as a civilian, leading America&#x27;s war against drugs.&quot;

On 17 February 2003, Mark Mazzetti and Kevin Whitelaw, in an article entitled &quot;Six Deadly Fears: The U.S. military is confident of victory in Iraq–but at what price?&quot; in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, quoted McCaffrey, &quot;whose 24th Mechanized Infantry Division helped execute the famous &#x27;left hook&#x27; attack against an Iraqi Army stronger than today&#x27;s in Operation Desert Storm, puts it this way: &quot;The Iraqis have no good military options. There is no technique, no tool that they can now adopt that will have any military significance on the outcome of the conflict... Most likely, Saddam would use artillery-delivered mustard gas and nerve agents against U.S. ground elements advancing on Baghdad. If so, says McCaffrey, &#x27;it&#x27;s going to create conditions of abject misery, but it will have no impact on the pace of the operation.&#x27;&quot;

==ONDCP Director==
Barry McCaffrey was director of Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) under President Bill Clinton from 1996 to 2001. He was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate on 29 February 1996. As director of ONDCP, McCaffrey sat in President Clinton&#x27;s Cabinet.

McCaffrey came to this position with experience interdicting drug smugglers from South America, as head of the Southern Command. He disliked the metaphor of a &quot;war&quot; on drugs, preferring to call it a malignancy for which he advocated treatment; at the same time, he also headed an initiative that began in 1999 to eliminate coca farming in Colombia.

As director of ONDCP, McCaffrey wrote and published the first &quot;National Drug Control Strategy&quot;. The book-length white paper proposed a comprehensive 10-year plan; profiled drug abusers and trends in youth drug abuse; listed health consequences; estimated the cost of drug-related crime; recognized that illegal drugs remain widely available; presented strategic goals and objectives for demand and supply reduction and measures of effectiveness; and proposed a comprehensive approach including initiatives aimed at youth and initiatives to reduce drug-related crime and violence, to reduce health and social problems, to shield U.S. frontiers, and to reduce drug availability; and asked for resources to implement the strategy.

===Paid anti-drug messages in TV programs===
During McCaffrey&#x27;s tenure, ONDCP implemented a policy of buying paid anti-drug advertising on television and also paying television producers to embed anti-drug messages into major television programs. WB network&#x27;s senior vice president for broadcast standards Rick Mater acknowledged, &quot;The White House did view scripts. They did sign off on them–they read scripts, yes.&quot; Running the campaign for the ONDCP was Alan Levitt, who estimated that between 1998 and 2000 the networks received nearly $25 million in benefits. One example was with Warner Brothers&#x27; show, &quot;Smart Guy&quot;. The original script portrayed two young people using drugs at a party. Originally depicted as cool and popular, after input from the drug office, &quot;We showed that they were losers and put them [hidden away to indulge in shamed secrecy] in a utility room. That was not in the original script.&quot; Other shows including &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and &quot;7th Heaven&quot; also put anti-drug messages into their stories.

Details about the program were published by &quot;Salon&quot; on 13 January 2000. McCaffrey defended the program saying, &quot;We plead guilty to using every lawful means to save America&#x27;s children&quot;; President Clinton defended McCaffrey. Clinton said on 14 January, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s my understanding that there&#x27;s nothing mandatory about this, that there was no attempt to regulate content, or tell people what they had to put into it–of course, I wouldn&#x27;t support that.&quot; McCaffrey opposed efforts in Congress to extend the national anti-drug media campaign to include messages against underage drinking.

==Comments on the War on Terror and the Iraq War==
McCaffrey has harshly criticized U.S. treatment of detainees during the War on Terror. According to McCaffrey: &quot;We should never, as a policy, maltreat people under our control, detainees. We tortured people unmercifully. We probably murdered dozens of them during the course of that, both the armed forces and the CIA.&quot; He &quot;supports an investigation of the government lawyers who knowingly advocated illegal torture, and he specifically cited Bush&#x27;s White House counsel and attorney general in the same discussion, emphasizing that &#x27;we better find out how we went so wrong.&#x27;&quot;

In June 2005, McCaffrey surveyed Iraq on behalf of U.S. Central Command and wrote an optimistic report afterwards. In the report, McCaffrey described U.S. senior military leadership team as superb and predicted the insurgency will reach its peak from January-to-September 2006, allowing for U.S. force withdrawals in the late summer of 2006. A year later, however, after visiting Iraq again, his assessment was grim: &quot;Iraq is abject misery... I think it&#x27;s a terribly dangerous place for diplomats and journalists and contractors and Iraqi mothers. Trying to go about daily life in that city is a real nightmare for these poor people.&quot; He called Abu Ghraib &quot;the biggest mistake that happened so far.&quot; In an official memorandum, McCaffrey nevertheless expressed optimism about the operation&#x27;s longer-term future:

The situation is perilous, uncertain, and extreme–but far from hopeless. The U.S. Armed Forces are a rock. This is the most competent and brilliantly led military in a tactical and operational sense that we have ever fielded... There is no reason why the U.S. cannot achieve our objectives in Iraq. Our aim must be to create a viable federal state under the rule of law which does not: enslave its own people, threaten its neighbors, or produce weapons of mass destruction. This is a 10-year task. We should be able to draw down most of our combat forces in 3–5 years. We have few alternatives to the current U.S. strategy, which is painfully but gradually succeeding. This is now a race against time. Do we have the political will, do we have the military power, will we spend the resources required to achieve our aims?

His assessment noted several negative areas as well as very positive areas in the struggle for democracy in the country. McCaffrey returned a third time in March 2007 and followed the visit with a third memorandum. The grimness of the 2006 assessment was repeated, additionally asserting a concern about the effect of the continuing war on the readiness of the small-sized U.S. military. He tempered his optimism about the future, saying, &quot;There are encouraging signs that the peace and participation message does resonate with many of the more moderate Sunni and Shia warring factions.&quot;

===Other military analysis===
In April 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a front-page report by David Barstow confirming that military analysts hired by ABC, CBS and NBC to present observations about the conduct of the war in Iraq had undisclosed ties to the Pentagon and/or military contractors. McCaffrey was &quot;at the heart of the scandal&quot; detailed by Barstow. In late November 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published another front-page article by Barstow, this time specifically profiling General McCaffrey. It detailed his free movement between roles as a paid advocate for defense companies, media analyst and a retired officer. An earlier report with some of the same information had appeared in The Nation in April 2003 but was not widely picked up. Specifically, McCaffrey signed a contract with an undisclosed equity stake and retainer to represent Defense Solutions to U.S. military leadership. Within days after signing the contract, McCaffrey sent a proposal directly to David Petraeus, then the commanding general in Iraq, recommending Defense Solutions and its offer to supply Iraq 5,000 armored vehicles from former Soviet bloc countries. Subsequently, McCaffrey would continue to advocate the Defense Solutions proposal over equipping the Iraqi Army with U.S.-made equipment. McCaffrey and his consulting firm BR McCaffrey Associates LLC responded to &quot;The Times&quot; piece, stating that he is &quot;absolutely committed to objective, non-partisan public commentary.&quot; The response highlighted his military record, as well as his history of criticizing the execution of the Iraq War and specifically Rumsfeld. Journalist Glenn Greenwald later wrote that there had been &quot;extensive collaboration between NBC and McCaffrey to formulate a coordinated response to David Barstow&#x27;s story.&quot;

On 24 January 2009, in an article entitled &quot;The Generals&#x27; Second Careers,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; Public Editor (ombudsman) Clark Hoyt discussed Barstow&#x27;s allegations. He wrote,
&quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s [first] report [was] a 7,500-word article, 20 photographs and 5 graphics. Nine photos of retired officers talking on television—four of them on NBC or MSNBC—dominated the front page. They included the most celebrated of all military analysts, Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired Army four-star general who just happened to be the man excluded from the Pentagon&#x27;s information program for criticizing Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s management of the Iraq war. [...] The article barely mentioned McCaffrey and another NBC analyst, Gen. Wayne Downing, who died in 2007, yet included them in what a reader could reasonably interpret as a virtual rogue&#x27;s gallery of analysts spouting the Pentagon line.

On Nov. 30, under the [second] front-page headline &quot;One Man&#x27;s Military-Industrial-Media Complex,&quot; Barstow wrote that McCaffrey represented an exclusive club of mostly retired generals whose &quot;war commentary can fit hand in glove with undisclosed commercial interests[.]&quot;

Barstow said he never intended to say that McCaffrey did anything illegal or unethical. He said he was describing how the world works and raising the issue of disclosure of potential conflicts.

McCaffrey, a much-decorated, thrice-wounded war hero, unhappily became the symbol of an entrenched system of insider access, overlapping interests and lack of public disclosure. It is an issue of high interest in Barack Obama&#x27;s Washington. Even as they testified to McCaffrey&#x27;s integrity, some of his most ardent supporters recognized that the system presented multiple opportunities for conflicts of interest. [...] McCaffrey said he will follow any disclosure rules, as long as they apply to everybody, not just retired military officers.

== Criticism of Donald Trump ==
On 16 March 2018, McCaffrey received significant media attention after sending out a message on Twitter announcing his conclusion that US President Donald Trump was a threat to national security and &quot;under the sway of&quot; Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin. McCaffrey specifically cited Trump&#x27;s tepid response to United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s announcement that the Russian government was behind an alleged nerve gas attack on 4 March in Salisbury, England.

Reluctantly I have concluded that President Trump is a serious threat to US national security. He is refusing to protect vital US interests from active Russian attacks. It is apparent that he is for some unknown reason under the sway of Mr Putin.

==Post-government work==
After McCaffrey retired from government service in 2001, he continued to provide his expertise to a wide spectrum of clients. He is currently a military analyst for NBC and MSNBC, and president of his own consulting firm, BR McCaffrey Associates.

In October 2004, McCaffrey was elected by the board of directors of HNTB Corporation to serve as the board chairman of a newly formed subordinate company, HNTB Federal Services. In January 2008, McCaffrey was elected to the board of directors of The HNTB Companies, an employee-owned organization of infrastructure firms known for their work in transportation, tolls, bridges, aviation, rail, architecture, urban design, and planning.

McCaffrey also serves on the boards of directors of Atlantic Council of the United States, DynCorp International, Global Linguist Solutions, McNeil Technologies, and CRC Health Group, a nationwide for-profit chain of addiction treatment centers and behavioral therapy programs for related disorders.

He is also an honorary advisor of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, member of Council on Foreign Relations, an Associate of the Inter-American Dialogue, a principal for Council on Excellence in Government, a member of the CSIS U.S.-Mexico Binational Council, chairman of Vietnam Veterans Memorial Education Center Advisory Board, a senior executive associate for Army Aviation Association of America, and a member of the board of advisors of National Infantry Foundation. McCaffrey also participates in U.S. Army Fires Center, Senior Field Artillery Advisory Council, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

McCaffrey is an advocate for parity (coverage by health insurers of behavioral disorders coequal to their coverage of other diseases) and of drug courts and veterans&#x27; courts and is a frequent speaker at conferences.

==Personal life==
McCaffrey is married to Jill Ann Faulkner. They have three children: Sean, Tara, and Amy; they also have three grandchildren. Their son, Colonel Sean McCaffrey, retired from the Armed Forces after his third combat tour.

<doc id="704705" wikidata="Q3243331" url="?curid=704705" title="List of dams in the Columbia River watershed">
<text>There are more than 60 dams in the Columbia River watershed in the United States and Canada. Tributaries of the Columbia River and their dammed tributaries, as well as the main stem itself, each have their own list below. The dams are listed in the order as they are found from source to terminus. Many of the dams in the Columbia River watershed were not created for the specific purposes of water storage or flood protection. Instead, the primary purpose of many of these dams is to produce hydroelectricity. As can be seen in the lists, these dams provide many tens of gigawatts of power.

Major dam construction began in the early 20th century and picked up the pace after the Columbia River Treaty in the 1960s, by the mid 1980s all the big dams were finished. Including just the dams listed below, there are 60 dams in the watershed, with 14 on the Columbia, 20 on the Snake, seven on the Kootenay, seven on the Pend Oreille / Clark, two on the Flathead, eight on the Yakima, and two on the Owyhee. Averaging a major dam every , the rivers in the Columbia watershed combine to generate over 36,000 megawatts of power, with the majority coming on the main stem. Grand Coulee Dam is the largest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States, generating 6,809 megawatts, over one-sixth of all power in the basin.

In addition to providing ample power for the people of the Pacific Northwest, the reservoirs created by the dams have created numerous recreational opportunities, including fishing, boating, and windsurfing. Furthermore, by creating a constant flow and consistent depth along the river channel, the series of locks and dams have allowed for Lewiston, Idaho, to become the furthest inland seaport on the west coast of the United States. Despite the numerous benefits to humans that the dams have provided, a number of environmental consequences have manifested as a result of the dams, including a negative impact on salmonid populations of the basin.

<text>Mario Mendell Winans ( Brown; born August 29, 1974) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter, and record producer from South Carolina. An extended member of the Winans musical family, he is best known for his 2004 single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; (featuring Enya and P. Diddy), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

Prior, Winans signed with Dallas Austin&#x27;s Rowdy Records as an in-house producer during the early-1990s, and received his first major credits for his work on R. Kelly&#x27;s self-titled second album (1995) and Pebbles&#x27; &quot;Straight from My Heart&quot; (1995). As a recording artist, he signed with Motown and released his debut studio album, &quot;Story of My Heart&quot; (1997) to commercial failure. The following year, he contributed to Diddy&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Come with Me&quot;, and thereafter served as in-house talent for his Bad Boy Records production team, the Hitmen. While receiving further credits on commercially successful releases, he saw mainstream attention for his guest performance on Diddy&#x27;s 2000 single &quot;Best Friend&quot; as well as his 2002 single &quot;I Need a Girl (Part Two),&quot; both of which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—with the latter peaking at number four—and Winans signed with Bad Boy, an imprint of Universal Records as a solo act. Moreover, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; served as the lead single for his debut studio album &quot;Hurt No More&quot; (2004), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the following year, he co-wrote CeCe Winans&#x27;s song &quot;Pray&quot;, which won Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards.

Winans&#x27;s recording work accompanies a career in production and songwriting, from which he has been credited on releases for artists including the Weeknd, Kanye West, the Notorious B.I.G., Ice Spice, Lil&#x27; Kim, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Jennifer Lopez, Pusha T, Busta Rhymes, and Trey Songz, among others.

==Career==
===&quot;Hurt No More&quot; (2001–2005)===
Mario Winans recorded his second album &quot;Hurt No More&quot; in 2001, 2002, and 2003 in between working with other artists. The album is based on stories of love and betrayal.

The first single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was based on a sample of the Fugees&#x27; 1996 hit single &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, which itself was based on a slowed-down sample of the instrumental track &quot;Boadicea&quot; by Enya from her 1987 self-titled album. Enya and her representatives said yes to Winans and P. Diddy for her approval of the sample. She even re-recorded Boadicea for the song, although Winans had no idea that the Fugees sample he had used was a sample itself. They even gave Enya herself credit for the single as &quot;Mario Winans featuring P. Diddy and Enya&quot;. The song features a rap by P. Diddy. The song was released as a single in early 2004 and became a worldwide hit, reaching number 1 in Germany and the United Kingdom and on the rhythmic top 40 radio chart in the United States; to number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the US R&amp;B/Hip-Hop singles chart; and to number 3 on both the Australian and Norwegian singles charts. It also reached the top ten on a composite European singles chart.

&quot;Hurt No More&quot; was released on April 20, 2004, in the US and by early June 2004 had reached number 1 on the Billboard R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 3 on the UK Albums Chart.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Never Really Was&quot;, used a sample of the orchestrated beginning of Madonna&#x27;s 1986 hit &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; as its background music. However, the song failed to chart in North America. A remix version was released as a single featuring rapper Lil Flip.

The song &quot;This Is the Thanks I Get&quot; was stated to be the album&#x27;s third and final single but no official release was set. The song went on to peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under R&amp;B chart at number 12.

<text>Djurgårdens Idrottsförening, commonly known simply as Djurgårdens IF, Djurgården (), and (especially locally) Djurgår&#x27;n (), Dif or DIF – is a Swedish sports association with several sections, located in Stockholm. Djurgårdens IF is an since 1991 and, , it consists of 22 individual sports clubs.

==Name==
The club is named after the city park and borough Djurgården, which originally was a royal hunting park. A direct translation of &quot;Djurgården&quot; would be &quot;the animal garden&quot; or &quot;the animal yard&quot;. The word &quot;djur&quot; means &quot;animal&quot; but has the same etymology as the word &quot;deer&quot;, meaning &quot;deer garden&quot; may have been its original meaning.

==History==
===Founding (1891–1896)===

The club was founded in 1891 by a group of young athletes living in the borough and port district on Djurgården in central Stockholm. Inspired by the Norwegian His Majesty the King&#x27;s Guard and their ski jumping exhibitions in Stockholm, the adolescents of the area contested diverse sports against each other both summertime and wintertime. On 12 March 1891, John G. Jansson, then 22 years old, and a dozen others founded Djurgårdens IF near . The exact address was a café on Alberget 4a. Jansson became the first chairman. Most of the founders were from the working class, and Djurgården maintained that profile for most of its early history, in sharp contrast with middle class rivals AIK. From the beginning, to be considered a member, one had to live on the island of Djurgården, but this was soon erased from the statues of the club.

With an original focus on winter sports and athletics, the club quickly branched into other sports, becoming one of Sweden&#x27;s most successful sports clubs of the 20th and 21st century.

===Initial achievements (1897–1923)===
In 1897, Gustaf Söderström became Djurgårdens IF&#x27;s first Swedish champion when he won the shot put (both hands), event at the Swedish Athletics Championships. He repeated the achievement the following year, and also won the discus throw event. Söderström also competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics and won the tug of war event. Club mate Karl Gustaf Staaf was also in the Denmark–Sweden mixed team that won.

The football department was formed in 1899 with the help of former GAIS player Theodor Andersson. The team played its first match in July 1899, a 1–2 loss against AIK. Soon started a strong and close competition with neighbouring club AIK. Both were founded within a month in 1891. The two rivals play the Tvillingderbyt.

In 1900, Ernst Ekberg became the clubs first Swedish champion in racewalking, winning the 5000 metres event.

The team consisted of Erik Andéhn, Gunnar Friberg, Ivar Friberg, Götrik Frykman, Gottfrid Johansson, Erik Lavass, Bror Modén, Algot Nilsson, Karl Öhman, Arvid Spångberg, and Birger Walla. Women were allowed into the club in 1908. In 1909, Tage Carlsson won the clubs first national championship title in cycling, when he won the 5 km track event.

The first emblem of the club was a four-pointed silver star in saltire, which had a shield on it with the letters DIF. This star pre-dates the similar star which Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna adopted and is using to this day. The present emblem, in the form of a shield in yellow, red and blue with the text D.I.F. was adopted in 1896. According to an often-quoted poem by Johan af Klercker from 1908, blue and yellow stand for Sweden and red stands for love. Blue and yellow are also the colours of Stockholm.

Yellow, red and blue are the club colours. The logo is registered as a trademark and the colours are set to Pantone, CMYK and web colour values. In many sports – among them football, bandy and handball – the home jersey of the team is vertically striped in light and dark blue. Because of this, blue is usually seen as the most important of the three colours. Shorts have been either dark or white. The ice hockey team uses jerseys in one blue shade with yellow and red details.

In other sports, Djurgården also have used black tricots with blue lampasses (athletics and boxing) and blue tricots with a club badge (wrestling).

<text>Lisa Rinna (born July 11, 1963) is an American actress, television personality, and model. She portrayed Billie Reed on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and Taylor McBride on Fox&#x27;s television drama &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Between 2014 and 2022, Rinna starred on Bravo&#x27;s reality television series &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.&quot; Other television credits include being a contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, as well as guest-starring roles on &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Community&quot;, &quot;The Middle&quot;, and &quot;American Horror Stories&quot;. Rinna made her Broadway debut in &quot;Chicago&quot; as Roxie Hart in June 2007.

She was the host of Soapnet&#x27;s talk show &quot;Soap Talk&quot; (2002–2006), for which she earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Talk Show Host. Rinna has written three books: &quot;Starlit&quot;; &quot;The Big, Fun, Sexy Sex Book&quot;; and &quot;Rinnavation&quot;. Her other ventures include a fashion line for QVC named The Lisa Rinna Collection, the cosmetics collection Rinna Beauty, and the beverage company Rinna Wines.

==Early life==
Lisa Rinna was born July 11, 1963, in Newport Beach, California, to Lois Irene (née DeAndrade) and Frank Rinna. She is of Portuguese and Italian descent. When Lisa was seven, her older half-sister Laurene died. During that same year, her family relocated to Medford, Oregon, when her father was transferred there for job-related reasons, and she spent the remainder of her childhood there. Rinna graduated from Medford Senior High School in 1981.

==Career==
===1981–1991: Career beginnings===

After graduating from high school, Rinna moved to San Francisco to pursue a career as a model. She started her career by appearing in commercials and believed she obtained her SAG card &quot;doing a Mervyn&#x27;s commercial&quot;.

At age 21, Rinna appeared in the music video for John Parr&#x27;s single &quot;Naughty Naughty,&quot; as the passenger in Parr&#x27;s car. Rinna later made her television debut appearing as the girlfriend of Jason Bateman&#x27;s character in several episodes of &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; in 1990. 

===1992–1999: Soap opera stardom===
In 1992, she first played the character of Billie Reed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Her character earned Rinna two consecutive Soap Opera Digest Awards. She departed in 1995, but reprised the role in 2002, 2012, and 2018. 

She then made the jump to primetime television, portraying Taylor McBride on Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Melrose Place&quot; from 1996 to 1998. 

In 1998, Rinna, while six months pregnant with her first daughter, posed for a nude pictorial (&quot;Melrose Mom,&quot; its title, paid tribute to her role in &quot;Melrose Place&quot;) and cover shoot for the September issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. She later recounted the instructions given to her by &quot;Playboy&quot; photographer Deborah Anderson: &quot;&#x27;I do not want you long and sinewy and angular and muscular. I want you soft...&#x27; This was really hard for me because being 35 years old and posing for &quot;Playboy&quot;, you want to amp it up.&quot;

Through the late 1990s, Rinna appeared in a series of television films, including Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Lies &amp; Obsession&quot; opposite her husband Harry Hamlin, based on Hamlin&#x27;s real life sex addiction and alcoholism.

===2000–2007: Subsequent roles and venture into hosting===

In 2000, Rinna starred in the Lifetime film, &quot;Another Woman&#x27;s Husband&quot;, which boasted one of the highest ratings for a movie on Lifetime since 1999. 

In 2001, Rinna played the role of Veronica Simpson in the comedy film &quot;Good Advice,&quot; which starred Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards.

Rinna was the host of &quot;Soap Talk&quot; (2002-2006), the flagship daily lifestyle show of cable network Soapnet. She and co-host Ty Treadway received four consecutive Daytime Emmy Award nominations for their work. At the same time, Rinna hosted three seasons of Lifetime&#x27;s TV home makeover program &quot;Merge&quot;. 

In 2004, Rinna guest-starred on the ABC sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; and the CW drama &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, playing the recurring role of Lynn Echolls on the latter.

In 2006, Rinna competed in the second season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional dancer Louis van Amstel. She was eliminated in round seven based on audience voting, despite having higher marks from the judges than fellow celebrity dancer Jerry Rice. She was a regular guest co-host on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly.&quot;

In 2007, she portrayed Drama&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Donna Devaney on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;, in the episode &quot;Malibooty.&quot; 

Over the summer of 2007, Rinna starred as Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of &quot;Chicago&quot; alongside her husband, who played the role of Billy Flynn.

In 2007, she also hosted Oxygen&#x27;s &quot;Tease&quot;, a reality competition series for hairstylists. From 2007 to 2009, she was the host of TV Guide Network&#x27;s awards season red carpet coverage, replacing Joan Rivers.

===2008–2013: Expansion into reality TV and entrepreneurship===

In 2008, she appeared in Disney Channel&#x27;s musical comedy television series &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, in the role of Mr. Dontzig&#x27;s cousin Francesca. That same year, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Rinna and Hamlin had signed a deal to create a reality television series based on their family life. The series, titled &quot;Harry Loves Lisa&quot;, premiered on TV Land on October 6, 2010, and ran for 6 episodes. 

In 2008, she released a series of workout videos called &quot;Dance Body Beautiful&quot;.

In May 2009, she posed again for &quot;Playboy&quot; and once again was also its cover model. She also graced the covers of &quot;CVLUX&quot;, &quot;Living Well&quot;, &quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot; and &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;.

In 2009, Rinna expressed interest in reprising her role of Taylor McBride on the CW&#x27;s revival &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, if given the offer; however, the series was cancelled after only one season. In 2010, she was also featured as a guest judge on the fourth episode of the second season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. 

In 2011, Rinna appeared on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; as Brooke Diamond. Rinna then competed in season 4 of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. She was eliminated after being the project manager on the second task, writing and performing a children&#x27;s book. Rinna returned to the show in its sixth season as one of the &quot;All-Stars&quot; contestants. After being eliminated from that roster, she appeared on the May 13, 2013, episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; with Lil Jon to discuss their time on the show. 

Rinna and her husband Harry Hamlin jointly owned the Belle Gray clothing boutique in Sherman Oaks, California in 2011. They closed the store in 2012 because, by then, both had grown too busy with their respective acting careers to manage it.

Rinna began appearing in more commercials and print ads during this time in her career. She appeared in print ads for Mars Inc&#x27;s M&amp;M candies with Joey Fatone as part of the &quot;There&#x27;s an M&amp;M in everyone&quot; advertising campaign. In 2012, Rinna appeared in an infomercial for abdominal muscle toner &quot;The Flex Belt&quot; alongside Adrianne Curry, Denise Richards and Janet Evans. She has appeared in a television commercial for Taco Bell and an infomercial for Winsor Pilates. In 2012 to benefit the charity Dress for Success, she modeled an adult incontinence brief made by Depend under a tight-fitting evening gown. She appeared in print ads and commercials for Depend and, according to reports, Depend paid her $2 million to be their celebrity spokesperson. 

In April 2012, Rinna brought her collection to QVC as the Lisa Rinna Collection.

===2014–2022: Established reality TV star===

In 2014, she appeared as one of the contestants on ABC&#x27;s game show &quot;Sing Your Face Off&quot;.

In 2014, Rinna joined the main cast of &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot; for the show&#x27;s fifth season. Her casting is often credited with &#x27;saving&#x27; the series midway through its run, delivering a substantial boost in ratings. She acknowledged in a 2019 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview that being a Housewife brought her unprecedented attention: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been more famous than I am at this point, because of the show.&quot;

In June 2019, Rinna launched an activewear collaboration with retailer Goldsheep. Proceeds from the collaboration benefited The Trevor Project, a national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide-prevention services to LGBTQ youth. In September 2019, she walked the runway for Kyle Richards&#x27; and Shahida Clayton&#x27;s new women&#x27;s clothing brand at New York Fashion Week.

In September 2020, Rinna announced that she will be launching Rinna Beauty, with its lip kits named Birthday Suit, Legends Only, and No Apologies.

In 2021, Rinna reprised her role of Billie Reed for a special Peacock miniseries, &quot;Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem,&quot; alongside costars Deidre Hall, Eileen Davidson, and Jackée Harry. She has continued to appear in television roles, with guest parts on series including &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Middle, The Guest Book&quot;, &quot;Awkward.&quot; and &quot;This Close&quot;.

In August 2022, Rinna announced on an episode of &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot; she is in the process of entering the alcoholic beverage industry with a product called Rinna Rosé.

===2023–present: Post-&quot;Housewives&quot; career===

On January 6, 2023, Rinna announced her departure from &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot; after eight seasons.

In 2023, Rinna guest starred on the third season of &quot;American Horror Stories.&quot;

==Legacy==
Rinna is credited as one of the best Housewives. In 2020, a Buzzfeed profile on Rinna observed: &quot;She’s created her own brand of iconic absurdity with her self-help catchphrases (“Own it, baby!!”), tearful controversies about stuffed rabbits, and one of the most aggressive glass-breaking scenes in &quot;Housewives&quot; history (a tall order in the franchise).&quot; She was nominated as Favorite Reality Star at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards for her role in the show.

==Personal life==
Rinna married actor Harry Hamlin on March 29, 1997, in Beverly Hills, California. They have two daughters, Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray. 

She has acknowledged having plastic surgery and having silicone, Botox, and Juvéderm injections.

On November 15, 2021, Rinna announced that her mother Lois, who was featured in &quot;The Real Housewives&quot; franchise, died of a stroke. Lois Rinna had survived being attacked by the Trailside serial killer David Carpenter in 1960, three years before Lisa was born.

In a 2008 appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, he discussed how the relationship made him realize his true sexuality: &quot;She&#x27;s the coolest, nicest chick ever. She&#x27;s an absolute catch, and I thought, &#x27;If I&#x27;m not going to feel the super sparks with her... it probably means I&#x27;m gay.&#x27;&quot;

Harris publicly came out as gay in November 2006, saying, &quot;I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.&quot;

<text>KOI (&quot;КОИ&quot;) is a family of several code pages for the Cyrillic script.
The name stands for &quot;Kod obmena informatsiey&quot; () which means &quot;Code for Information Interchange&quot;.

A particular feature of the KOI code pages is that the text remains human-readable when the leftmost bit is stripped, should it inadvertently pass through equipment or software that can only deal with 7 bit wide characters. This is due to characters being placed in a special order (128 codepoints apart from the Latin letter they sound most similar to), which, however, does not correspond to the alphabetic order in any language that is written in Cyrillic and necessitates the use of lookup tables to perform sorting.

These encodings are derived from ASCII on the base of some correspondence between Latin and Cyrillic (nearly phonetical), which was already used in Russian dialect of Morse code and in MTK-2 telegraph code. The first 26 characters from А (0xE1) in KOI8-R are А, Б, Ц, Д, Е, Ф, Г, Х, И, Й, К, Л, М, Н, О, П, Я, Р, С, Т, У, Ж, В, Ь, Ы, З.

== KOI-7 ==

The original KOI encoding (1967) was a 7-bit code page named KOI-7 (&quot;КОИ-7&quot;), which did not contain lowercase letters.
In KOI-7, the codes of the 31 or 32 Russian letters are ordered according to the Latin letters. Other code points are the same as in ASCII (however, the dollar sign $ (code point 24hex) may be replaced by the universal currency sign ¤).

== KOI-8 ==
KOI-8 (КОИ-8), standardized in 1974 as GOST 19768, is an 8-bit extension of ASCII. Originally it only included 32 lowercase and 31 uppercase Russian letters.

Later derivatives of KOI-8 constitute the family of encodings variously known as KOI8, KOI 8 and KOI-8.

The family members are:

*KOI8-B (with Ёё and Ъ)
*KOI8-R / KOI8-RUSSIA for Russian and Bulgarian (RFC 1489). (Code page 878)
*KOI8-U / KOI8-UKRAINE for Ukrainian (RFC 2319). (Code page 1168)
*KOI8-RU for Ukrainian, Belorussian and Russian. (Code page 1167)
*KOI8-T for Tajik. (FreeDOS Code page 62318)
*KOI8-C, also KOI8-CA, a proposal for Caucasus and Central Asia; hardly ever been used. (FreeDOS Code page 61294)
*ISO-IR-111 / KOI8-E (ECMA-113 (1st ed., 1986), multilingual for Slavic languages).
*KOI8-F, KOI-8 Unified. Includes the letter allocations from both KOI8-U and KOI8-E, with a subset of the pseudographics from KOI8-R. (FreeDOS Code page 60270)
*KOI8-K1 &quot;Cyrillic-1&quot; (defined in CSN 36 9103, ST SEV 358–88)
*KOI8-O (formerly KOI8-C) for Old Russian orthography. (FreeDOS Code page 63342)

Additionally, GOST R 34.303-92 defines &quot;KOI-8 V1&quot; which is ISO-IR-153, and &quot;KOI-8 N1&quot; and &quot;KOI-8 N2&quot; which are variants of Code page 866. These do not follow the KOI-8 layout.

== DKOI ==
DKOI is an EBCDIC-based encoding used in ES EVM mainframes. It has been defined by several standards: GOST 19768-74 / ST SEV 358–76, ST SEV 358-88 / GOST 19768–93, CSN 36 9103.

There are two variants:
*DKOI K1 (ДКОИ К1), each Cyrillic letter is given its own code point.
*DKOI K2 (ДКОИ К2), some Cyrillic letters (А, В, Е, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, Х, а, е, о, р, с, у, х) are merged with visually identical Latin letters.

== Latin variants ==
Some encodings are called KOI, but define Latin alphabets:
*KOI8-CS / KOI8-CS2 for Czech and Slovak (ČSN (Czech technical standard) 369103, devised by the Comecon. This encoded Latin with diacritics, as used in Czech and Slovak, rather than Cyrillic, but the basic idea was the same - text should remain legible with the 8-th bit cleared, thus e.g. Č became C etc.).
*KOI8-L2 &quot;Latin-2&quot; (defined in CSN 36 9103), ISO IR 139 (almost identical to ISO 8859-2 (1987), but has the dollar sign and currency sign swapped)
*DKOI CS2 (defined in CSN 36 9103)
*DKOI L2 (defined in CSN 36 9103)

<text>Shek Kip Mei, is an area in New Kowloon, to the northeast of the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. It borders Sham Shui Po and Kowloon Tong.

==History==

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Shek Kip Mei was 72.

A major fire on 25 December 1953 destroyed the Shek Kip Mei shanty town of immigrants from Mainland China who had fled to Hong Kong, leaving 53,000 people homeless.

After the fire, the governor Alexander Grantham launched a public housing programme to introduce the idea of multi-storey building for the immigrant population living there. The standardised new structures offered fire- and flood-resistant construction to previously vulnerable hut dwellers. The programme involved demolishing the rest of the makeshift houses left untouched by the fire, and the construction of the Shek Kip Mei Low-cost Housing Estate in their stead. The apartments were small, only about . Each unit could house five people, and each building had a capacity of 2,500 residents. The rent was HK$17 per square foot per month, while the rent for a commercial store downstairs was HK$100 per month. Foreign tourists visiting the apartment complexes referred to them as &quot;prisons&quot;. Some scholars have argued that the government has been overstating the role of the fire in the history of public housing in Hong Kong.

At the north of Shek Kip Mei is Tai Wo Ping (), along Beacon Hill. This was a cottage area (a type of resettlement accommodation) from the 1950s to 1970s, but it has been developed into a public housing estate, Chak On Estate (), and two private housing estates, Beacon Heights () and Dynasty Heights ().

==Present==

The Government has backed off from its plans to redevelop the area, following great opposition from many who believe they symbolised the history of Hong Kong. An alternative plan to renovate it for use as a hostel and museum has been completed. The museum includes restored rooms, resident stories and photos, and documentation of the history of public housing estates.

Shek Kip Mei now has several types of housing including the public apartments, Pak Tin Estate and private housing such as Beacon Heights and Dynasty Heights. Several malls and churches can also be found in the area now.

The old Shek Kip Mei Factory Estate was renovated and now serves as the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre.

==Transportation==
Since 1 October 1979, it has been served by Shek Kip Mei station on the MTR at Woh Chai Street and Wai Chi Street.

Route 7 passes to the north of the area and accessed via Nam Cheong Street.

KMB and New World First Bus operates a number or routes that travel within the area.

==Education==
Shek Kip Mei is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 40. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and two government schools: Fuk Wing Street Government Primary School and Li Cheng Uk Government Primary School.

<text>Mary Beth Evans (born March 7, 1961) is an American television actress, known for her role as Kayla Brady on the NBC daytime soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and her role as Sierra Estaban on the CBS daytime soap &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

==Career==
Evans is most famous for portraying Kayla Brady on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1986 to 1992, 2006 to 2009, and 2010 to present. In the 1980s, her character became half of the supercouple Steve and Kayla, with Steve &quot;Patch&quot; Johnson played by Stephen Nichols. In regard to Steve and Kayla’s first wedding, which was one of the biggest in “Days’” history, Evans remarked, “I think it was number one? And that wedding was just so extravagant. It was outside, which was a big deal on a daytime show. It was beautiful.” Evans left the show in 1992 but returned (with Nichols) on June 12, 2006 after a fourteen-year absence. In 2009, Evans and Nichols were written off &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Evans returned in 2010 and has appeared on a recurring basis every year since. In 2015, she was placed back on contract with the series.

Prior to her first stint on &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, Evans portrayed Piper in the teen romantic comedy flick &quot;Lovelines&quot;. She has guest-starred in number of primetime television series, including Madame’s Place, &quot;Father Murphy&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and &quot;Body of Proof&quot;.

Evans appeared on other daytime soap operas between her stints at &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In September 1993, she began playing the villainous Katherine Bell on &quot;General Hospital&quot; (and later on &quot;Port Charles&quot;) until October 1999. Evans moved to New York City to play Sierra Estaban on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from December 2000 to late 2005, later reprising the role from July 2010 until the show&#x27;s finale on September 17, 2010. In 2005, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; almost signed her on contract for the role of Dr. Paige Miller, but Evans backed out at the last moment and the role was filled with Kimberlin Brown.

Since 2010, Evans has starred on the soap opera web series &quot;The Bay&quot; as Sara Garrett. As a producer for the series, she won a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approaches Drama Series. In 2016, Evans was nominated again as a producer, as well as in the category Outstanding Actress in a Digital Daytime Drama Series for portraying Sara. The same year, she was also nominated in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Evans won all three. She won two more Emmys in 2017 for &quot;The Bay&quot;, for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Digital Daytime Drama Series and as a producer for Outstanding Digital Daytime Drama Series.

In 2014 and 2015, Evans also appeared as Catherine Hendrie on the ABC Family drama series &quot;Chasing Life&quot;.

==Personal life==
Evans was born in Pasadena, California and grew up in Orange County, California.
She married cosmetic surgeon Michael Schwartz on November 3, 1985. They have three children, Daniel Luke (born 1987), Katherine Elizabeth (born 1990), and Matthew Joseph (born 1993).

<text>The Roland D-50 is a synthesizer produced by Roland and released in April of 1987. Its features include digital sample-based subtractive synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analog synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550, with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters.

The D-50 has been used by musicians including Prince, Sting, Michael Jackson and Enya. The D-50 has also been used by Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream and the Pet Shop Boys in various years, since the synthesizer came out in 1987. 

==History==
The D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine sample playback with subtractive synthesis. The engineers at Roland determined that the most difficult component of an instrument&#x27;s sound to simulate realistically is the attack. To better emulate realistic sounds, the D-50 included 47 attack samples in ROM. The synthesizer played back an attack sample which was dove-tailed with more conventional subtractive synthesis to create the sustain of the sound. This dual-use method was required in 1987 since RAM was so expensive. Roland did, however, incorporate a number of &quot;texture&quot; samples that could be mixed into the synthesized sustain part of a patch. These sustain samples gave many D-50 patches a lush and airy quality.

The Roland D-50 was awarded a TEC Award for outstanding technical achievement in musical technology in 1988.

==Technology==
Although the D-50 was among the first non-sampling machines to be able to produce sounds with sample-based characteristics, it was not long before many synthesizers on the market began using similar methods to create sounds. Roland later released a series of lower-priced keyboards and modules that allowed musicians who couldn&#x27;t afford the relatively expensive flagship D-50 to have some of these sounds (Roland D-10 (1988), D-110 (rack version of D-10) (1988) D-20 (1988), D-5 (1989), MT-32). Though these lower-priced D-series synthesizers did not contain the full &quot;LA&quot; synth engine, each was 8-part multi-timbral, and Roland doubled the number of onboard PCM samples. Roland also produced the 76-key, 6-octave &quot;Super-LA&quot; D-70 (1989-1990). With the D-70 Roland removed the digital synthesis section, which was replaced with full-length, more realistic and natural-sounding samples, including an acoustic piano, which the D-50 lacked. The D-70 also had an expanded filter and effects section and was 5 part multi-timbral. Even with its improvements, however, the D-70 was unable to catch up with the dominant workstation of the time—the Korg M1—and failed to become the next Roland flagship synthesizer.

The D-50 produces a hybrid analog/digital sound: one can use traditional square and saw waveforms together with PCM samples of actual acoustic instrument attack transient, modified by LFOs, TVFs, TVAs, ring modulator, effects, etc. This breakthrough led to the creation of totally new sounds never done before on either purely analog synths or digital samplers.

Each D-50 sound (&quot;patch&quot;) was made up of 2 &quot;tones&quot; (upper and lower) and each tone was made up of 2 &quot;partials&quot;. Each partial could be either a &quot;synthesizer waveform&quot; (a square with variable pulse, or after manipulation by the filter, a sawtooth) and a filter or a digital PCM waveform (sampled attack transient or looped sustain waveform). The partials could be arranged following 1 of 7 possible &quot;structures&quot; (algorithms), with a combination of either a PCM waveform or synthesized waveform, with an option to ring-modulate the two partials together. The synthesized waveforms could be pulse-width modulated and passed through a digital mathematical approximation of a low-pass filter, allowing for subtractive synthesis. The lower and upper parts could be split or played in dual on the keyboard. The Dual configuration allows two 8-voice polyphony Tones (two Partials each) to be played from separate MIDI channels as a limited bi-timbral mode (no full Patches with both Upper and Lower Tones available).

Not only was the synthesis method new; the D-50 was arguably the first commercial synthesizer to include digital effects such as reverb, adding to the characteristically bright, rich, lively and sometimes realistic sound, featured on countless records of the period. Each of those effects had 10+ variations with editable parameters usually found in dedicated rack effects processors rather than keyboard synths. It was also at the forefront of the change of the look of a typical keyboard player on stage: instead of being surrounded with multiple instruments, with more versatile instruments and the continued adoption of the MIDI standard, they were starting to appear with only one or two keyboards, typically a D-50 with either Yamaha DX7 or Korg M1, sometimes all three synths.

The D-50 was fully MIDI-compatible, though it transmits on only one channel. The keyboard was velocity- and after-touch-sensitive, and the keys were slightly &quot;weighted&quot; with metal for a higher-quality feel. It included 64 patches on board, and storage of 64 more patches was available through optional expansion RAM cards. It uses a CR2032 lithium battery for memory backup.

For its sound and build quality, and the unique synthesis method it featured, the D-50 has remained popular to this day, with the resale value of good condition examples remaining relatively high. Its synthesis engine, in more or less updated forms, was used in Roland&#x27;s JV and XP series synths, among others. Furthermore, in 2004, Roland released a VC-1 expansion card for V-Synth and VariOS synthesizers. It contained a modeled and updated D-50 synthesis engine and the original operating system, including factory- and all Roland &quot;expansion cards&quot; patches. Since the newer DAC chips sounded &quot;cleaner&quot; with less noise output and overall higher bit depth and sample rates, it included the option to simulate the D-50&#x27;s &quot;rougher&quot; output.

The D-550 is a rack-mount version of the D-50, with fewer front panel controls, no joystick and sliders. It employs the same sound circuitry (the main circuit board is exactly the same in both, labeled &quot;D-50/D-550&quot;)

The D-50&#x27;s capabilities could be modified through the addition of third-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral) and expanded the patch memory, as well as a chip that improved the D-50&#x27;s response to incoming MIDI commands.

==Legacy==
The D-50 was introduced in 1987 as the popularity of the Yamaha DX7 was starting to decline, resulting in the D-50 becoming the most popular synthesizer on the market until the introduction of the Korg M1 the following year. The D-50&#x27;s synthesizer-on-top-of-samples-and-through-effects innovation was an influence on the M1, which went on to become Korg&#x27;s top-selling keyboard, until the release of the Korg Triton. In fact, this scheme was a common method of digital keyboard sound creation for more than a decade, until ROM and Flash RAM were finally inexpensive enough to store entire samples or multisamples.

The presets of the D-50, authored by Eric Persing and Adrian Scott, were well received by the artists&#x27; community, and most of them can be heard on numerous commercial albums of the late 1980s. The D-50&#x27;s factory presets have enjoyed a long legacy, such as &quot;Digital Native Dance&quot;, &quot;Staccato Heaven&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Pizzagogo&quot;, &quot;Glass Voices&quot;, and &quot;Living Calliope&quot; . Some other D-50 presets live on in every machine that conforms to the General MIDI specification, including &quot;Fantasia&quot; (alternatively called &quot;New Age Pad&quot;), &quot;Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, and &quot;Nylon Atmosphere&quot;.

The &quot;Pizzagogo&quot; preset has a lively plucking strings impression. Enya&#x27;s song Orinoco Flow famously featured &quot;Pizzagogo&quot; with emphasised attack.

The Roland V-Synth and V-Synth XT can load a card that emulates the D-50. In this mode, they copy the D-50 almost perfectly, although they lose the more sophisticated V-Synth capabilities.

On September 8, 2017, Roland announced the Roland D-05, a miniaturized version of the D-50, as part of their Boutique series. The instrument includes the original presets of the D-50, plus all of the ROM expansions Roland created for it. The instrument was released in October 2017.

Also in 2017, Roland released a VST plugin version of the D-50 via their Roland Cloud website.

<text>Stephan Douglas Jenkins ( ; born September 27, 1964) is an American singer, guitarist, and the frontman of the alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. He began his musical career in 1992 as part of the short-lived rap duo Puck and Natty, alongside Detroit rapper Herman Anthony Chunn. Following the breakup of the duo, Jenkins and guitarist Kevin Cadogan formed Third Eye Blind in 1993. The band released their eponymous debut studio album in 1997, which went multi-platinum in the United States. Since then, they have released nine more albums: &quot;Blue&quot; (1999), &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; (2003), &quot;Ursa Major&quot; (2009), &quot;Dopamine&quot; (2015), &quot;We Are Drugs&quot; (2016), &quot;Thanks for Everything (cover album)&quot; (2018), &quot;Screamer&quot; (2019), &quot;Our Bande Apart&quot; (2021), and &quot;Unplugged&quot; (2022). As part of Third Eye Blind, Jenkins has received one &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award and eight California Music Awards.

Jenkins released a live album, &quot;Live at Amoeba&quot;, as a Record Store Day exclusive vinyl in 2016. Jenkins made his debut as a solo artist as a feature on Run-DMC&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Rock Show&quot;. In the same year, he made his acting debut with a cameo in the film &quot;Rock Star&quot;. He also appeared in the television series &quot;All That&quot; (2003) and &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; (2005), in addition to pursuing his first lead role in the 2003 thriller &quot;Art of Revenge&quot;. As a producer, Jenkins helmed the production on albums by The Braids, Vanessa Carlton, and Spencer Barnett.

== Early life ==

Jenkins was born in Indio, California. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Wisconsin where his father was a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, after graduating from Northwestern University. They later moved to Palo Alto, California when Stephan was six. When he was seven years old, his parents divorced. His mother became an alcoholic. During elementary school, he had dyslexia, causing him to repeat first grade. His father, who later got positions at Stanford and then the University of California, Berkeley, would help him with his dyslexia. He attended Henry M. Gunn Senior High School and graduated in 1983. Jenkins got interested in music early in life. He recalls creating original musical works at the age of five using pots and pans on the floor of his kitchen at home in northern California. In 1987, he graduated from University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelor of Arts in English literature. 

Jenkins began musical work as a drummer. During high school, he performed with &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, consisting of Jenkins on drums, Nick Dement (guitar), Ben Austin (bass), and Greg Magel (guitar). Though the precocious Jenkins was still in high school, the other three were students at neighboring Stanford University. With the breakup of Fast Forward, Austin and Magel departed; Jenkins and Dement added new bassist Scott Lockhart and formed the trio Splash. Stanford University student Lawrence Schoeffler made a music video for their song &quot;Suzaie&quot; as part of his graduate portfolio in film production, which was broadcast on MTV Basement Tapes (1983) and won a bronze medal at the International Film &amp; TV Festival of New York.

== Puck and Natty ==
Jenkins then formed Puck and Natty (the name originating with the Shakespeare characters, but also serving as a playful poke at a well-known Bay Area jazz duo, Tuck &amp; Patti), a &#x27;funky rap masta&#x27; group, with Detroit rapper Herman Anthony Chunn in 1992. Puck and Natty was short lived; however, their track, &quot;Just Wanna Be Your Friend&quot; landed on a soundtrack album of the hit TV show &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; in 1992. In a 1999 interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Jenkins provided a synopsis of the way things went down. &quot;&#x27;You want me to do a song for your TV show that I&#x27;ve never seen? No problem,&#x27; recalled Jenkins. &#x27;It was $7,800. I bought groceries.&#x27;&quot; The duo later changed their name to Puck &amp; Zen because of a complaint from the jazz duo, Tuck &amp; Patti.

== Third Eye Blind and mainstream success ==
Jenkins formed Third Eye Blind in 1993 with Kevin Cadogan. They played small gigs around the San Francisco Bay Area for years and were, for the most part, unknown until they were signed in 1996 by Elektra Records. The band&#x27;s deal with Elektra was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for a previously unsigned artist. Jenkins has written or co-written every song on the band&#x27;s five studio albums and one EP. Jenkins won two California Music Awards for Best Songwriter along with bandmate Cadogan; in addition, he was nominated three years in a row as Best Vocalist and won Artist of the Year.

== Other work ==
=== Producing ===
Jenkins has produced for Third Eye Blind and several music artists. In 1997, he co-produced Third Eye Blind&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album with Eric Valentine. The duo also helmed production on The Braids&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Here We Come&quot; (1999). He co-produced follow-up &quot;Blue&quot; (1999) and &quot;Out of the Vein&quot; (2003) with Arion Salazar and Third Eye Blind, while acting as the sole producer on &quot;Ursa Major&quot; (2009), &quot;Dopamine&quot; (2015), and &quot;We Are Drugs&quot; (2016). In 2004, Jenkins co-wrote four songs for and produced Vanessa Carlton&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Harmonium&quot;. He co-wrote five songs for Carlton&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Heroes &amp; Thieves&quot; (2007), in addition to co-producing the effort with Irv Gotti and Linda Perry. In 2015, Jenkins produced Spencer Barnett&#x27;s extended play, &quot;13 Summers In&quot;. In 2020, Jenkins co-wrote Blackbear&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Bad&quot;.

=== Acting ===
Jenkins made his acting debut with a cameo in the film &quot;Rock Star&quot; (2001) playing Bradley, the lead singer of the fictional band Black Babylon. He has also appeared in the former Nickelodeon series &quot;All That&quot;, and he appeared on the MTV candid camera show &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; when Vanessa Carlton was the subject of one of Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s practical jokes. He also starred as the lead role in the 2003 independent thriller, &quot;Art of Revenge&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Jenkins was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome preceding the 1997 release of &quot;Third Eye Blind&quot;.

Jenkins was in a three-year relationship with actress Charlize Theron until October 2001. Some of Third Eye Blind&#x27;s third album, &quot;Out of the Vein&quot;, explores the emotions Jenkins experienced as a result of their breakup. From 2002 to 2007, Jenkins dated Vanessa Carlton.

When asked about living as a high-profile musician, he stated &quot;Am I a rock star? Yeah, I guess. I also get to live in North Beach and go to a pub and drink my pint and go to a café and drink my coffee. I carry groceries home on the tank of my motorcycle. I find pleasure in things that are simple. Is that a rock star&#x27;s life? It is for me.&quot;

Jenkins is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. He is an advocate for gay rights, stating that he was influenced by queer culture in San Francisco. In 2016, Jenkins voiced support for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In 2024, he put his San Francisco house on the market for $3.6 million.

<doc id="704762" wikidata="Q262781" url="?curid=704762" title="Alison Sweeney">
<text>Alison Ann Sweeney (born September 19, 1976) is an American actress, reality show host, director and author. Sweeney is best known for her portrayal of Samantha &quot;Sami&quot; Brady on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, a role she played under contract with the show from January 6, 1993 to October 30, 2014. In this role, she earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination, four Soap Opera Digest Awards and a Fan Voted Daytime Emmy Award. After making sporadic appearances since then, she returned as a series regular in 2021. In 2007, she became the host of &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; in its fourth season, and left the series at the end of the 16th season in 2015.

== Personal life ==
Sweeney is of Irish descent and has two brothers. She studied economics at UCLA but left due to her commitment to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. On July 8, 2000, Sweeney married David Sanov, after dating for nearly three years. The couple have two children: a son born on February 25, 2005, and a daughter born on January 12, 2009. The family currently lives in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
Sweeney&#x27;s television debut was at age five in a Kodak advertisement. A few years later, she was in the episode &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Saying Goodbye&quot; of the horror series &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, playing a young girl who could sense when others were going to die shortly before their deaths. In 1988, she appeared on the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Family Man&quot;, and the following year, was cast as Christy McCray on &quot;Brand New Life&quot;, a miniseries from future &quot;X-Files&quot; creator Chris Carter that aired within NBC&#x27;s &quot;Magical World of Disney&quot; in October 1989. The miniseries, which co-starred Barbara Eden as Sweeney&#x27;s mother and Don Murray as her new stepfather, was considered for pick-up as a stand-alone series beyond its &quot;Disney&quot; tryout, but the regular series never materialized.

On January 6, 1993, then 16-year-old Sweeney first appeared in the role of Samantha &quot;Sami&quot; Brady in the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;—a show of which she was a fan.

In the 1990s, cultural society continued to have very problematic views on weight. Sweeney was a US dress size 12 (UK dress size 16). She was not obese by medical standards, but still larger than her television peers; this it became an issue. She documented all the tabloid talk and personal anguish in her 2004 memoir, &quot;All The Days of My Life (So Far)&quot;.

In 2002, she appeared on a celebrity episode of the NBC reality game show &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. She has appeared in other NBC shows such as &quot;Friends&quot;, where she played an actress on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In 2007, she joined the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; as a co-host for the live television broadcast. She returned to her co-hosting duties for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 telethons.

In 2007, Sweeney took over hosting duties on &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, replacing Caroline Rhea since the fourth season. She was surprised but happy to be offered the role, where she is able to cheer on contestants and share their victories.

Sweeney has written four books: &quot;All The Days of My Life (So Far)&quot; (released in May 2004), &quot;The Star Attraction&quot; (released in May 2013), &quot;Scared Scriptless: A Novel&quot; (released in June 2014) and &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; (released in April 2016).

In July 2013, Sweeney appeared in &quot;Second Chances&quot;, a Hallmark Original Movie, alongside &quot;Days&quot; co-star Greg Vaughan. The movie was filmed before Sweeney and Vaughn became siblings on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

On January 20, 2014, Sweeney announced on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that after 21 years of being on the air on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, she was leaving the show, to focus on spending more time with her family, and to work on her other show, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;. She stated in the interview that she would be on the show throughout 2014, and that she would like her character on the show to have a happy ending with a &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; twist.

On July 9, 2014, it was announced that Sweeney would be joining &quot;General Hospital&quot; behind the scenes as a director, starting later that month. On April 26, 2015, Sweeney announced that she will be returning to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; to be part of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations.

On August 25, 2015, it was announced that Sweeney would not be returning to &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;.

Beginning on October 13, 2017, Sweeney reprised her long-term role as Sami Brady on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, over 24 years after her first appearance as a teenaged Sami Brady.

She played podcast host Alex McPherson in the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries film series &quot;Chronicle Mysteries&quot;, which started in 2019, with a fifth movie in 2021.

From 2015 to present, Sweeney appeared in the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries film series &quot;Murder, She Baked&quot;, based on Joanne Fluke&#x27;s books.

<doc id="704765" wikidata="Q938682" url="?curid=704765" title="Alfajor">
<text>An alfajor or alajú (, plural &quot;alfajores&quot;) is a traditional confection typically made of flour, honey, and nuts. It is found in Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, the Philippines, Southern Brazil, Southern France, Spain, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, El Salvador and Chile. The archetypal &quot;alfajor&quot; entered Iberia during the period of al-Andalus. It is produced in the form of a small cylinder and is sold either individually or in boxes containing several pieces.

==Etymology==
According to Spanish philologist and dialectologist Manuel Alvar López, &quot;alfajor&quot; is an Andalusian variant of the Castilian &quot;alajú&quot;, derived from the Arabic word , , meaning luxurious, and, contrary to some beliefs that it originated in the New World, was introduced to Latin America as &quot;alfajor&quot;. The word had been introduced into Spanish dictionaries in the 14th century.

The publication of historical dictionaries of the Spanish language allows one to document both forms of the original &quot;alajur&quot;, written as &quot;alajú&quot; and &quot;alfajor&quot;. &quot;Alajur&quot; and multiple geographic variations are sweets made of a paste of almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs and honey. It is possible that &quot;alfajor&quot; and &quot;alajú&quot; were Arabisms introduced into the Spanish language in different places and times, and, supposing both came from the same etymology, from a linguistic point of view, &quot;alajú&quot; is probably an Arabism of Castillian Spanish, and so it is still alive in Cuenca, Toledo, Guadalajara and in &quot;la Sierra de la peña de Francia&quot;; meanwhile the variation &quot;alfajor&quot; is Andalusian and Murcian. In the Americas, the word &quot;alfajor&quot; was not known until the 19th century.

==History==
A similar sweet called &quot;alaú&quot; is found in the Arabic-Hispanic cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh, by an anonymous author. The Spanish grammarian Nebrija noted the word for the first time in his Latin-Spanish Dictionary (1495) as: &quot;alfaxor&quot; or &quot;alaxur&quot;. In the 12th century, Raimundo Martin describes in his book &quot;Vocabulista&quot; another possible etymology of the Hispano-Arabic &quot;fasur&quot;, meaning &quot;nectar&quot;.

==Preparation and presentation==
The regulations of the Andalusian Ministry of Agriculture allow the use of only pure honey, almonds, nuts, breadcrumbs, sugar, flour and spices, such as aniseed, sesame, cilantro, cloves and cinnamon. The Protected Geographical Indication &quot;alfajores&quot; are meant to be presented in a cylindrical shape, with a minimum weight of each, and with a minimum size of about in length and a diameter of . Each of them will be protected with a wrapping paper, and the ends made an ornament in a spiral shape with a ribbon out of the same paper. Once individually wrapped, they may be packaged in wood or cardboard boxes, but never in plastic.

== Europe ==
===In Spain===
In Spain, there are a variety of different recipes for preparing &quot;alfajores&quot;, but the most traditional contain flour, honey, almonds and several spices, such as cinnamon. &quot;Alfajores&quot; are most commonly sold around Christmas, but in Medina Sidonia, they are available year-round. The traditional Spanish &quot;alfajor&quot; has been produced in this town (where it is called an &quot;alajú&quot;) since ancient times, and the recipe has been traditionally handed down from father to son.

&quot;Alfajores&quot; are still made by craftsmen in Medina Sidonia using natural ingredients that include honey, almonds, hazelnuts, sugar, flour, and breadcrumbs, and mixed with natural spices. The manufacturing process has been respected following a recipe found by Mariano Pardo de Figueroa in 1786. In Medina Sidonia, the annual production of approximately is mostly consumed in the province of Cadiz, but they are also famous in Sevilla, Malaga and Huelva.

On 15 September 2004, protected geographical indication was ratified by the &quot;Consejo de agricultura y pesca de la junta de Andalucía&quot; and published in the &quot;Official Journal of the European Union&quot; as &quot;Alfajor de Medina Sidonia&quot; on 6 March 2007.

In the province of Cuenca, Spain, where the &quot;alfajor&quot; is called &quot;alajú&quot; it is made with almond, honey and figs, all wrapped in a wafer. Medina Sidonia was the capital for the Arabic world of confection, where the &quot;alfajor&quot; has centuries of history with a recipe that has been transmitted from generation to generation. In this town, there is an account of Mariano Pardo de Figueroa, a gastronomist better known by his pseudonym Doctor Thebussem, who documented the history of this sweet, wherein he wrote that on 2 July 1487, Enrique de Guzmán, second count of Medina Sidonia, ordered the council and majors of the region to send to Malaga 50 cows, 50 oxen, 200 calves and provision of &quot;alajú&quot; from his city.

The recipe documented by the accounts of Thebussem in the 19th century is defined as the following:

==In the Americas==
===In the Caribbean===
In Puerto Rico, they underwent creolization, lost their almond and gained ground cassava. They can take varying amounts of sugar and spices. It&#x27;s possible that Puerto Rico&#x27;s most common version of this dessert (South American version with dulce de leche) reached Puerto Rico from Venezuela, but the opposite is also possible. Depending on region some add cornstarch, citrus zest, ginger and honey, filled with chocolate, vanilla cream, dulce de leche, fruit paste, or coconut. The filling can be mixed with almonds, sesame seeds, coconut flakes, or sprinkles. Traditional &quot;alfajores&quot; in Argentina, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela consist of two round, sweet biscuits made of wheat flour or corn starch joined with dulce de leche (known as &quot;manjar blanco&quot; in Peru and as &quot;arequipe&quot; in Venezuela), and optionally coated with powdered sugar. More modern &quot;industrial&quot; varieties in Uruguay and Argentina, are coated with dark or white chocolate (many &quot;alfajores&quot; are sold in &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; versions), or simply covered with powdered sugar. These are also known as a &quot;Chilean Oreo&quot;. One variation is called &quot;alfajor de nieve&quot; (snow alfajor) and has a white coating consisting of a mixture of egg whites and sugar. Most &quot;alfajores&quot; come packaged in aluminium foil. Alfajores are made in various diameters and are consumed as snacks.

===In South America===

Alfajores have been popular in Argentina and Uruguay since the mid-19th century. However, these differ from the Spanish alfajores in that they are made with two round cookies with different sweet fillings between them. The filling is usually dulce de leche, although there are many variations. They can be covered with powder sugar (the traditional ones), glazed sugar (Santafesinos or &quot;de nieve&quot;), grated coconut or chocolate. Argentina is one of the world&#x27;s largest consumer of alfajores, both in total numbers and in per capita calculations, actually consuming more than a billion alfajores a year, while being the most common snack for schoolchildren and adults.

Some of the best-known alfajor brands in South America are the Argentine &quot;Balcarce&quot;, &quot;Jorgito&quot;, &quot;Capitán del Espacio&quot;, &quot;Guaymallen&quot;, &quot;Suchard&quot;, &quot;Havanna&quot;, &quot;Cachafaz&quot;, &quot;Juanote&quot; and &quot;Estancia El Rosario&quot;, the Uruguayan &quot;Punta Ballena&quot;, &quot;Sierra de Minas&quot;, &quot;Alfajores Portezuelo&quot;, &quot;Marley&quot;, and Peruvian &quot;Casa del Alfajor&quot;.

==== In Argentina ====
The &quot;alfajor&quot; has been manufactured and consumed since colonial times in the territories that today belong to Argentina.

===== Industrial alfajor =====
Mass-production of alfajores traces back to the Atlantic coast of Argentina in the 1950s. Brands such as Havanna and Balcarce, and as many as 30 others, have been introduced into shops and supermarkets. Statistics of the year 2021 shows that inhabitants of Argentina consume 6 million alfajores per day. Supermarkets carry a wide variety of product, up to 34 different kinds. These include &quot;triple alfajores&quot;, which are composed of three biscuits adhered to one another with dulce de leche and covered with chocolate.

===== Regional =====
Around 1851 in the district of Arocena (province of Santa Fe), Manuel Zampatti, known as Zapatin, began commercially manufacturing an existing variety of alfajor consisting of three baked cookies adhered with dulce de leche and coated with sugar. These came to be known as &quot;alfajor santafesino&quot;. Colonel Néstor Fernández took it to the battle of Caseros, and was there when the army tasted it and it became so popular that General Justo José de Urquiza had alfajores taken to his San José de Entre Ríos farm with a weekly load of these alfajores. They are also manufactured in the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Tucumán, and the famous brand Havanna manufactures them in the city of Mar del Plata and in most of the tourist places of Argentina.

The Cordobes alfajor stands out among the regional varieties of Argentina; it is filled with jellies of fruits (generally of quince), one of the most well - known brands is Estancia El Rosario. Other outstanding variety is the alfajor from Santa Fe which has no less than three puff pastry covers adhered to one another with much dulce de leche and everything glazed (Industrial preparations can be differentiated because they are not coated in the lower part, since the coating is made in plates). In addition, In Santa Fe, it can be acquired the Rogel, of similar characteristics, but bigger (the size of a small cake) and the variety from Tucuman, which is known as a clarita and it is made up with two crunchy cookies as covers and filled with a jelly made up of sugar molasses. In Argentina, alfajores made up of cornflour are very consumed as well (covers made up of maize starch, filled with dulce de leche and grated coconut around the joining).

==== In Peru ====
Alfajores made their arrival to the Viceroyalty of Peru, the largest administrative district of the Spanish Empire in South America in the 16th century, and have been popular since, especially the artisanal types.

==== In Chile ====
The cornflour alfajor is consumed during the whole year in the central areas of Chile; on the other hand, in the southern areas of Chile, it is consumed another variety of alfajor, generally for Patriotic festivities of September.

The alfajor is basically a sponge cake or cookies adhered with manjar (dulce de leche) and generally coated in meringue or marmalade and optionally with sprinkled icing sugar. Two types of alfajores are mainly outstanding in Chile:

* The first type of alfajor, similar to the one of corn flour prepared in other countries of Latin America, is prepared over all the territory of Chile, and mainly in the central area of Chile, where it is a traditional candy. It is known with other names as &quot;candy of corn flour&quot; or the typical &quot;chilenitos&quot;. The &quot;chilenitos&quot; are manufactured with corn flour or other types of flour and tend to be simpler and smaller than the typical alfajores.
* The second type of alfajor, considered the true traditional alfajor of the country and known as &quot;chilean alfajor&quot;, is mainly prepared in the southern areas of Chile. Unlike the traditional alfajores of corn flour, it stands out because it is prepared with two hojarascas (kind of thin and firm cookie) that, since they are previously baked, acquire a curved form in their extremes. They are adhered to each other with dark brown sugar, panela, manjar or with confectioners cream (if they are filled with dark brown sugar, the hojarascas are a little bit thicker and flatter than those filled with manjar). Optionally, they can be garnished in the end of the filling with grated coconut as it is the case of the alfajores filled with manjar or with ground nuts.

====Guinness World Record: the biggest South American &quot;alfajor&quot;====
According to Guinness World Records, the biggest &quot;alfajor&quot; in the world, measuring almost in diameter and in height and weighing , was made on 11 December 2010 in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Uruguay. The giant &quot;alfajor&quot; was made to mark the celebration of Uruguay&#x27;s first National Alfajor Festival. More than 30 people participated in the preparation of the record-breaking &quot;alfajor&quot;.

<text>The Šar Mountains (, ; colloquially also Šara, ) or Sharr Mountains () is a mountain range in Southeast Europe, extending into several countries from southern Kosovo, to northwestern North Macedonia, to northeastern Albania. The sections in Kosovo, and in North Macedonia are national parks (Sharr Mountains National Park in Kosovo). Rugged and barren, the mountains are among the highest in the Balkans, with 30 peaks higher than .

== Etymology ==
In antiquity, the mountains were known as &quot;Scardus&quot;, &quot;Scodrus&quot;, or &quot;Scordus&quot; (το Σκάρδον ὂρος in Polybius and Ptolemy). It is considered of Indo-European origin (cf. &#x27;steep&#x27;), and has been compared to the toponym &quot;Scardona&quot; and to the tribal name &quot;Scordisci&quot; (with &quot;Scardus&quot; featuring the Illyrian vocalism &quot;/a/&quot;). The theory according to which the modern &quot;Sharr/Šar&quot; represents an evolution of the ancient name &quot;Scardus&quot; through Albanian sound changes is untenable on the basis of current historical-linguistic research. &quot;Sharr/Šar&quot; rather can be traced to meaning &#x27;saw&#x27;, denoting the jagged peaks and &#x27;saw-toothed ridge&#x27;, ultimately from (also used in some Romance languages: cf. , , &#x27;steep mountain range&#x27;). In the early 16th century, it was recorded that the mountain was called &quot;Catena Mundi&quot; (Latin for &quot;the chains of the world&quot;).

Sometimes the range is called &quot;Carska Planina&quot; (, &quot;Tsar&#x27;s Mountain&quot;), as a reference to the capitals (Prizren and Skopje), courts (Nerodimlje, Pauni, Svrčin, etc.) and monasteries (monastery of the Holy Archangels) of the Serbian Empire located in the region. In the medieval period, Serbs called the mountain &quot;Mlečni&quot; (), because of the major milk production on the mountain and the vast herds of cattle, goats and sheep. In the golden bull issued by Emperor Dušan on 20 September 1349, he says: &quot;I also bequest all of mine estates and areas around the Mlečni Mountain (&quot;Milk Mountain&quot;), the Durlev estates and all the metochions and all the wealth and treasure of that region&quot;. The bull is kept in the Dubrovnik Archive.

== Borders ==
The mountain borders extend from the city of Prizren, following the two rivers of the Prizrenska Bistrica and the Lepenac. In the east, it passes by the town of Kaçanik through the Kaçanik Gorge and into North Macedonia via the Polog Valley. The border passes near the Vardar spring called Vrutok and enters near the Mavrovo Valley. There the Radika river separates the mountain massif from the higher Mount Korab. After that, the border is mounting, reaching the point of junction of three state borders: Kosovo, North Macedonia and Albania. The border now follows the road to the small, mountainous, town of Restelica, the rivers of Globocica, Plava and the White Drin and finally reaches the city of Prizren.

== Geographical characteristics ==

The Šar Mountains have a total area of 1,600 km2. 56,25% of that area is in North Macedonia, 43.12% in Kosovo, and 0,63% in Albania. There are three plains: Sirinić, Vraca and Rudoka.
The system is about long and wide.

The mountain massif was formed in the Tertiary Period. The peaks are covered with ice and snow.

It includes several high peaks:
* Titov Vrv ()
* Mal Turčin ()
* Bakardan ()
* Borislavec ()
* Velika Rudoka ()
* Peskovi – east summit ()
* Peskovi – west summit ()
* Mala Rudoka ()
* Džini Beg ()
* Ezerski Vrv ()
* Karabunar ()
* Trpeznica ()
* Maja e zezë ()
* Golema Vraca ()
* Guzhbaba ()
* Isa Aga ()
* Black Peak ()
* Kobilica ()
* Piribeg ()
* Ljuboten ()
* Maja Livadh ()
* Zallina ()
* Mala Vraca () 
* Kara Nikolla () 
* Maja Koritnik ()
* Tumba Peak ()
* Gemitash () 
* Kallabak () 
* Kamenkullë () 
* Ksulje e Priftit Peak () tri-point 

There are 30 peaks higher than and 70 above the .

The Šar Mountains extend to Mount Korab () in the southwest, and pass into northeastern Albania with very small part (0.63% of the entire length).

Vegetation on the mountains includes crops up to around , forests up to , and above that lie high pastures which encompass around . The Šar Mountains are the largest compact area covered with pastures on the European continent. The dog breed Šarplaninac comes from this area.

The snowy peaks of the Šar Mountains are depicted on the coat of arms of the city of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city&#x27;s flag.

== History ==
The remains of the Široko complex are located near Mušutište. The complex originates from the period between the 10th and the 7th century BC, but also has medieval remnants. In Roman period, the mountain was a tripoint between the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia and Macedonia. The route of an ancient road crossed the &quot;Scardus&quot; from 169 BC. The road was later named &quot;Velji&quot; (&quot;Great&quot;) or Prizren road. &quot;Lisinski&quot; road was built. Remnants of the fort on the Kradište hill, near Prizren, dates from the 2nd to the 6th century and testifies the change of civilizations in this region: it started in the pre-Roman period, then became a Roman town and later a Byzantine one. Locality of Ravna Gora, predating the 6th century, where Slavs later cremated their dead, is situated in the area. Medieval military complex of Petrič Fortress, which consists of two fortresses, Little Petrič and Great Petrič, is also preserved. Remains of the Višegrad Fort, older part of the Prizren Fortress, are located in the gorge of the Bistrica river. When King Milutin donated lands to the Our Lady of Ljeviš church, he also donated the Višegrad Fort to serve as an Prizren&#x27;s defence outpost. Emperor Dušan later expanded the fort to the river and built his endowment, the Monastery of the Holy Archangels.

There are 45 Serbian Orthodox monasteries on the slopes of the mountain, dating from the 12th to the 16th century. Additional 32 monasteries were damaged or demolished during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 and in the later years. Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in the village of Gotovuša in Sirinićka Župa was built in 16th century. It was destroyed later and rebuilt in the second half of the 19th century. During the works in churchyard in the 2010s a floor mosaic was discovered from the much older church from the Byzantine period.

== Šar Mountains in Kosovo ==

The Šar Mountains are located in the south and south-east of Kosovo, where 43.12% of the range is located. Many alpine and glacial mountain lakes are found on the Kosovar part of the Šar Mountains, especially south of the town of Dragash, the area of Shutman and the region north of Vraca. The Brezovica ski resort, with an elevation of to above sea level, is located north-east of the mountains.

The mountain range in Kosovo is divided into three main zones: The zone of Ljuboten and Brezovica, the central zone of Prizren and the zone of Opoja and Gora.
The mountains border the Kosovo Plain to the north-east and the Metohia Valley in the northwest. Kosovo consists of the most eastern tip and the most northern part of the mountain ridge.
The Ljuboten peak and the mountain of Skopska Crna Gora create the Kaçanik Gorge in Kosovo. The Šar Mountains are split from the Nerodimka Mountain by the Sirinić Valley. The Šar National Park is located in Kosovo. Villages and towns that are found near the mountain are:

* Prizren, largest city located at the foot of the mountains.
* Kaçanik
* Dragash
* Brezovica
* Štrpce

Lakes in the Kosovo part of the Šar Mountains are:

* Jazhincë Lake
* Small Jazhincë Lake
* Shutman Lake
* Lower Defsko Lake
* Livadh Lake
* Black Vir Lake
* Donji Vir Lake
* Blateško Lake
* Upper Defsko Lake
* Dinivodno Lake

In total, there are 70 glacial lakes on Šara.

=== Kosovo national park ===


==== History ====
Sharr Mountains National Park is in the territory of Kosovo and covers on the northern slopes of the Šar Mountains as well as the mountains of Oshlak and Jezercë. The National Park &quot;Šar-Planina Mt.&quot; was proclaimed in 1986 within the temporary boundaries of , and opened in 1995. The final boundaries of the Park were expanded in 2012 to cover an area of .

==== Geography ====
The park occupies the northwest sections of the mountain&#x27;s main massif, including the highest peak, Bistra, an spreads over the sections of Prevalac, Ošljak, Ostrovica and Kodža Balkan. The park encompasses several different types of topographic relief: glacial (cirques, moraines and glacial lakes), periglacial (snow cirques, sliding blocks, &quot;tundra mosaic&quot; type of micro-shapes in the deposits of silt), karstic and fluvial. There are numerous rivers, springs, creeks, bogs and lakes.

==== Plant life ====
In total, there are 1,800 plant species. The mountain is inhabited by 175 strictly protected plant species, 247 Balkan endemites and 18 plants which can be found only on Šara. The park includes the endemic relict Macedonian Pine and white-bark pine, as well as the mugo pine and Alpine rose. Other perennial plants include King Alexander&#x27;s yarrow (&quot;Achillea alexandri-regis&quot;), Nikolić&#x27;s silene (&quot;Heliosperma nikolicii&quot;), &quot;Bornmuellera dieckii&quot;, Šar carnation (&quot;Dianthus scardicus Wettst.&quot;), Doerfler&#x27;s cinquefoils and Macedonian meadow saffron (&quot;Colhicum macedonicum&quot;). One of the relic species is Natalie&#x27;s ramonda. It went extinct from the most of Europe during the last ice age and today grows as an endemic species in several gorges in Serbia, North Macedonia and Greece. It has been chosen as the Serbian symbol for the Armistice Day.
==== Animal life ====
Rusenica locality on the mountain has been in the first level of protection, as the strict reserve of nature, since 1955. It is one of the rare habitats of Balkan lynx, the largest European cat. It is estimated that on the entire Balkans there are no more than 100 specimens. European pond turtle and Hermann&#x27;s tortoise, only two European species of freshwater turtles, live on the mountain. There are 147 butterfly species (excluding moths), 45 amphibians and reptilians and 37 mammalian species. Other animals include bear, chamois, wolf, roe deer, wild boar and other species including many bird species. The national park contains 720 chamois while the Opoja and Gora region contains 600 chamois. The National Park is administered by the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) of Kosovo.

<doc id="704778" wikidata="Q7164674" url="?curid=704778" title="Pensacola Beach, Florida">
<text>Pensacola Beach is an unincorporated community located on Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island, in Escambia County, Florida, United States. It is situated south of Pensacola (and Gulf Breeze connected via bridges spanning to the Fairpoint Peninsula and then to the island) in the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2000 census, the community had a total population of 2,738. It has been described as &quot;famous&quot; for its ultra-white sand beaches.

Pensacola Beach occupies land bound by a 1947 deed from the United States Department of Interior that it be administered in the public interest by the county or leased, but never &quot;disposed&quot;; its businesses and residents are thus long-term leaseholders and not property owners.

Pensacola Beach is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties.

==History==
: &quot;Also see: History of Pensacola, Florida.&quot;
Francisco Maldonado, a lieutenant under Conquistador Hernando de Soto, visited the area during the early Spanish exploration of North America. He anchored in Pensacola Bay for the winter of 1539–1540.

In 1559, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano led the first settlement of the region. His 11 ships, with 1500 settlers, anchored in the bay and established a colony on the site of today&#x27;s Naval Air Station Pensacola. Shortly after their arrival, on August 15, 1559, Friar Dominic de la Anunciacion conducted what is believed to be the first Christian religious service in the present-day United States. This event is commemorated by a marker near the possible site of the service, indicating the historical significance of the location as a place of early religious and cultural exchange.

A hurricane decimated the colony a few weeks later, killing hundreds and sinking five of the 11 ships. Suffering long-term famine and fighting, this first settlement was finally abandoned in 1561. A presidio was constructed on Santa Rosa Island in 1722 near the location of the more recent Fort Pickens. Hurricanes in 1741 and 1752 forced its relocation to the mainland.

Pensacola Beach remained largely undeveloped for many years. The Casino Resort was the first tourist destination constructed on the island (at the present day location of Casino Beach) where a variety of special events including beauty pageants, fishing tournaments, and boxing matches were held from the 1930s through 1950s. With a bar, tennis courts, bath houses, and a restaurant, it was a popular resort until it eventually closed in the 1960s.

The entire island was initially owned by the federal government. In order to promote infrastructure and growth on the island, the federal government leased the lands now encompassing Pensacola Beach to the Santa Rosa Island Authority (SRIA), which in turn has leased the property to homeowners. As a result, all structures on the island have 99-year renewable leases with the SRIA rather than ownership of the land itself.

==Geography==
Pensacola Beach is located at , on the barrier island of Santa Rosa. It is bordered to the south by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Santa Rosa Sound and Pensacola Bay, and to the east and west by the Gulf Islands National Seashore.

==Climate==

While generally cooler than most of peninsular Florida, Pensacola Beach maintains a more stable temperature year round than inland areas of Pensacola and Escambia County. As such, winter lows are several degrees warmer than Pensacola proper and summer highs are generally cooler as a result of the surrounding waters.

As with many islands, Pensacola Beach enjoys sea breezes which begin around noon and end around sunset in the summer, and there are often afternoon thunderstorms. The average temperature ranges from in January to in July.

===Hurricanes===
As a community located on a low-lying barrier island, Pensacola Beach is vulnerable to hurricanes. Landfalling storms have been known to drive storm surge over the island, damaging or destroying man-made structures and causing beach erosion. In 1995, two hurricanes made landfall on the island. Hurricane Erin made landfall in August, and Hurricane Opal blasted the island just two months later, leveling some dunes and destroying a number of homes.

On September 16, 2004, Hurricane Ivan devastated the Pensacola Beach area, destroying more than 650 homes and damaging many others. Ivan was the last hurricane to make Florida landfall in 2004, one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in decades.

On July 10, 2005, Hurricane Dennis made landfall between Pensacola Beach and eastern Navarre Beach. However, as with Erin almost a decade earlier, the damage on Pensacola Beach was not nearly as extensive as predicted.

In 2020, Pensacola Beach took the brunt of the storm from Hurricane Sally, seeing widespread wind damage, storm surge flooding, and over 20 inches (510 mm) of rainfall. A section of the Pensacola Bay Bridge (known to locals as the Three Mile Bridge) was destroyed during Hurricane Sally.

The island has been subject to mandatory evacuation orders during some of these hurricanes.

==Oil spill==
The &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;, a BP-operated oil-drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast, exploded April 20, 2010, eventually releasing almost 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf before being capped on August 4, 2010. Oil from the explosion did not reach Pensacola beaches until June 4, 2010. Crews posted along Escambia County&#x27;s coastline quickly cleaned much of the oil that was evident along the beaches. Tourism in the Pensacola Beach area was adversely affected during the summer of 2010. &quot;BBC News&quot; reported that swimmers at Pensacola Beach &quot;encountered an oil sheen and children picked up tar blobs as big as tennis balls.&quot;

==Public transportation==

Escambia County Area Transit (ECAT) provides bus transportation seven days per week.

==Government and infrastructure==
Escambia County Fire Rescue operates Fire Station #13 in Pensacola Beach.

The Escambia County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has Precinct 1 covering Pensacola Beach, operated out of the Pensacola Beach Sheriff&#x27;s Substation.

==Attractions==
===Casino Beach===
The hub of beach activity, Casino Beach, on Pensacola Beach, is named after the original casino that stood in this location and is a popular beach access. The location is dotted with restaurants and family entertainment areas. It is situated next to the Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier, which at 1,471 feet is described as the longest pier on the Gulf of Mexico. The beach is equipped with lifeguard stands and station, volleyball courts, snack bar and large parking lot. The Gulfside Pavilion hosts a &quot;Bands on the Beach&quot; concert series during the summer tourist season.

=== Gulf Pier ===

The Gulf Pier has been called an iconic part of Pensacola Beach by residents. It is maintained by Escambia County Public Works and the Santa Rosa Island Authority. In addition to fishing, the pier offers sightseeing marine wildlife such as dolphins and stingrays. It has been closed and renovated a number of times due to storm and hurricane damage.

=== Blue Angels ===
Pensacola beach is known for flyovers by the Blue Angels demonstration team from the nearby Pensacola Naval Air Station base. An annual air show is held each summer.

===Quietwater Beach Boardwalk===
The Boardwalk is on the Santa Rosa Sound side of the island, directly across from Casino Beach. Retail shops, restaurants, nightclubs, street musicians and sidewalk artists line it. The Boardwalk has a large sea shell stage where concerts are held several times a year.

===Fort Pickens===
Located at the western end of Santa Rosa Island, Fort Pickens was completed in 1834 and used until World War II, when modern weapons made traditional coastal defenses obsolete. It is open to the public as part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, with a fee required for entry; campsites are also available for a fee.

==Architecture==

=== Landmarks ===
==== Pensacola Beach Welcome Sign ====
Another historical landmark is the vintage Pensacola Beach Sign just outside Pensacola Beach in Gulf Breeze. It was a 60s-era neon sign that directs drivers towards Pensacola Beach&#x27;s &quot;scenic&quot; views of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as towards its white sand beaches, motels, and restaurants. The sign was renovated in 2019 to look exactly like the old sign but feature LED lights instead of neon.

==== Beach ball water tower ====
The beach ball painted water tower is an iconic symbol of Pensacola Beach. Today the water tower is no longer in use, but has been preserved by the city as a historical landmark.

===Novelty houses===
Pensacola Beach is home to several novelty houses, which are homes built with unusual shapes for purposes such as publicity or to copy other famous buildings in parody.

One of the novelty houses in Pensacola is the house &quot;Dome of a Home&quot;, built in 2002 using a monolithic dome in the form of a large concrete dome, designed to structurally withstand storm surge and hurricane-force winds of . It withstood hurricanes Ivan and Dennis. It is also known as the &quot;Flintstone Home&quot; due to the fact it resembles a rock home.

Another novelty house is the house with a UFO-shaped Futuro attached as a second story. This Futuro house is sometimes known as the &quot;Spaceship House&quot;. It was designed in the 1960s by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen. About a hundred of them were constructed.

==Education==

There is one school on Pensacola Beach. The Pensacola Beach Elementary School, within the Escambia County School District (ECSD), is for children from kindergarten through fifth grade. This school has an enrollment ranging from 120 to 140 students. All elementary-school age children on Pensacola Beach are eligible to attend the school. The first year the school was open, for the school year 1977–1978, classes were held in an empty A-frame house. The Pensacola Beach Volunteer Fire Department building was also used in aiding the teachers and administrators. In November 1977, four portable buildings were moved to the present site. They school has received the 5 Star School award since 1998. In 2001 the Pensacola Beach Elementary lost its direct district operational control and became a charter school. In September 2004 Hurricane Ivan destroyed an office and four classrooms. Jeff Castleberry, the principal, argued that ECSD would have closed the school if it had direct operational control. The costs to fix the damage at Pensacola Beach Elementary was $1.5 million. The campus is adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico and is built on stilt. The school has been described as one of several Escambia County charter schools that &quot;exemplify charter schools at their finest&quot;.

Pensacola Beach is zoned for (assigned to) a different ECSD elementary school, Suter Elementary School, as well as Workman Middle School, and Pensacola High School. However, most middle- and high-school students in Pensacola Beach attend Gulf Breeze Middle School and Gulf Breeze High School, operated by Santa Rosa County School District. In addition, some attend Pensacola-area magnet schools.

==Religion==
There are only two traditional churches on the island of Pensacola Beach. It is under the laws and guidelines of the Santa Rosa Island Authority that these be the only churches on the island. However, since around 2011, at least two other area churches have held satellite church meetings and openly worshipped on the water&#x27;s edge on Sunday mornings.

<doc id="704779" wikidata="Q1077576" url="?curid=704779" title="Chris Moore (film producer)">
<text>Chris Moore is an American film producer and director who has worked in the industry since the 1990s. Moore&#x27;s first film was &quot;Glory Daze&quot; (1995), followed by successes &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997) and &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999). In addition to producing films throughout the 2000s and 2010s, he has also produced television such as the first three seasons of &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;. He has directed two films, &quot;Kill Theory&quot; and &quot;The People Speak&quot;, both released in 2009.

==Life and career==
Moore was born in Easton, Maryland, where he grew up. He went to Harvard University where he studied American history. He worked as a production assistant at USA Network for two summers and found an opportunity to work as an intern for USA Network&#x27;s comedy TV series &quot;Up All Night&quot;. When Moore graduated from Harvard, he moved to Los Angeles with friends and began working in the mailroom at an agency. He eventually got promoted to literary agent and sold several scripts; some became films: &quot;The Stoned Age&quot;, &quot;PCU&quot;, &quot;Airheads&quot;, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, and &quot;My Girl&quot;. When Moore&#x27;s agency was acquired by ICM, he left and strove to become a film producer. With friends, he raised money to produce the film &quot;Glory Daze&quot;. He knew Matt Damon from Harvard in passing, and he approached Damon to star in the film. Damon turned down the opportunity in favor of paid work but introduced Moore to his friend Ben Affleck, who ultimately starred in &quot;Glory Daze&quot;. Afterward, Damon and Affleck wrote the screenplay for what would be &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and they involved Moore as co-producer in its production.

Moore became involved as producer for the 1999 film &quot;American Pie&quot;, which was a breakout hit. Moore subsequently produced its sequels. In June 2002, Moore co-founded the multimedia company LivePlanet with Damon, Affleck, and screenwriter/producer Sean Bailey. Moore became CEO of LivePlanet, and the company produced the TV series &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; as well as several films.

In 2016, he produced &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; through his production company, The Media Farm, in which he was nominated for an Academy Award.

Moore is married to Jenno Topping, who is also a film producer. They have a daughter named Maddie and a son. 

==Filmography==
He was a producer in all films unless otherwise noted.

<text>Deborah Ann &quot;Debbi&quot; Morgan is an American film and television actress. Morgan has appeared in a number of film and TV productions, and may be best known for the role of Angie Baxter–Hubbard on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. 

Morgan was the first African American to win the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance as Angie in 1989. She is also known for her role as the Seer in the fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot;. In film, her performance as Mozelle Batiste-Delacroix in &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot; (1997) earned critical acclaim and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female. More recently she played a recurring role as Estelle Green in the starz crime drama series &quot;Power&quot; and its spinoff &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot; from 2014 to 2021, and also co-starred in the Fox drama series &quot;Our Kind of People&quot;. 

==Early life==
Morgan was born in Dunn, North Carolina, the daughter of Lora, a teacher, and George Morgan Jr., a butcher. She has a younger sister, Terry. The family relocated to the Bronx when Morgan was still a child. In a 1997 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Morgan revealed that her father was an abusive alcoholic. While he never physically harmed his daughters, Morgan recalled her mother running from her father often. Her father died of leukemia in 1975. Morgan graduated from Aquinas High School.

==Career==
Morgan&#x27;s earliest film role was in the movie &quot;Monkey Hustle&quot; in 1976. She played the role of Vi. Morgan&#x27;s earliest recurring role was on &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; from 1976 to 1977 as Diane Harris, and also appeared on &quot;Good Times&quot;. In 1979, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Alex Haley&#x27;s great-aunt Elizabeth Harvey on the 1979 miniseries &quot;&quot;, and her guest-starring role as Curtis Jackson&#x27;s ex-girlfriend turned prostitute on &quot;The White Shadow&quot;. Her most notable role was Angie Baxter Hubbard on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role she originally played from January 1982 to July 1990. Her portrayal of Angie struck a chord with many Black viewers across America. Angie and her love interest, Jesse Hubbard (Darnell Williams), became the first African-American &quot;supercouple&quot; on daytime soap operas. In 1989, Morgan won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (which she shares with &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; actress Nancy Lee Grahn). She and Williams also co-hosted a music video show titled &quot;New York Hot Tracks&quot; in the mid-1980s.

After leaving &quot;All My Children&quot;, Morgan played the role of Chantal Marshall on the NBC soap opera, &quot;Generations&quot; (replacing actress Sharon Brown) and remained with the show until it ended. She then reprised her role as Angie Hubbard on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Loving&quot; in 1993. In 1995, she brought the same character to &quot;The City&quot; (a retooled version of &quot;Loving&quot;), making Morgan one of the few performers to portray the same character on three different soap operas. From 1997 to 1998, she also played Dr. Ellen Burgess on &quot;Port Charles&quot;. In the 1980s and 1990s, Morgan became a &quot;de facto&quot; symbol for the possibilities for black women as all of her soap opera roles involved her playing a successful doctor.

Morgan earned acclaim from movie critics for her portrayal of clairvoyant Mozelle Batiste Delacroix in director Kasi Lemmons&#x27; drama film &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot; (1997). For her portrayal, she won a Chicago Film Critics Association Award and an Independent Spirit Award and was nominated for an Image Award. She later left soap operas and began her film career with roles in &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999), &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1999), &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot; (2000), &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed&quot; (2004), &quot;Coach Carter&quot; (2005), &quot;Relative Strangers&quot; (2006), and &quot;Color of the Cross&quot; (2006). On television, she had roles in &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, and &quot;Soul Food&quot;.

From 2002 to 2003, Morgan played lead character Lora Gibson, opposite Lea Thompson, on the Lifetime drama series &quot;For the People&quot;. She also played the role of the Seer in the fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;Charmed&quot;. Morgan, along with costar Darnell Williams, returned to &quot;All My Children&quot; in January 2008, 10 years after leaving daytime television. In May 2009 and 2011, she was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. In 2011, ABC cancelled &quot;All My Children&quot;, and Morgan joined the cast of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Yolanda &quot;Harmony&quot; Hamilton on October 7, 2011, exactly two weeks after &quot;All My Children&quot; aired its final television episode on September 23, 2011. In 2013, Morgan appeared in the Web-based reboot of &quot;All My Children&quot;, reprising her role of Angie Hubbard. The series premiered on April 29, 2013, and was cancelled after a single season. In November 2013, after &quot;All My Children&quot; was cancelled, Morgan was cast in Starz drama series, &quot;Power&quot;, opposite Omari Hardwick and Naturi Naughton. In 2015, she co-starred alongside Richard Lawson and Vivica A. Fox in two TV One holiday movies: &quot;Royal Family Thanksgiving&quot; and &quot;Royal Family Christmas&quot;. Morgan later played Toni Braxton&#x27;s mother in the Lifetime biopic &quot;Toni Braxton: Unbreak My Heart&quot;.

In 2017, Morgan appeared in the Marvel miniseries &quot;The Defenders&quot; playing Delores. The following year, she had a recurring role in the BET drama series &quot;The Quad&quot;. In 2019, she appeared in the Netflix film &quot;Sextuplets&quot; starring Marlon Wayans. She starred with Kelly Rowland in the Lifetime movie &quot;Merry Liddle Christmas&quot; and its sequels. In 2021, she was cast in the Lee Daniels prime time soap opera, &quot;Our Kind of People&quot; opposite Yaya DaCosta. In 2023 she portrayed Keyshia Cole&#x27;s mother in the Lifetime biopic &quot;Keyshia Cole: This is My Story&quot;. Jasmine Blu from &quot;TVfanatic&quot; wrote in her review: &quot;Debbi Morgan, though, has always been a force, a legend who deserves every last bit of her flowers right here and now. To say she stole this film would be the understatement of the century. She was magnificent. She did such a remarkable job playing Frankie; there were moments it literally gave me chills. It&#x27;s almost eerie how well Morgan embodied the late mother and grandmother.&quot; Morgan later was cast in the drama film &quot;Divorce in the Black&quot; written and directed by Tyler Perry.

==Personal life==
Morgan has been married four times and has no children. Her first marriage was to Charles Weldon from 1980 until 1984. In 1989, Morgan married actor Charles S. Dutton, divorcing in 1994. From 1997 until 2000, Morgan was married to photographer Donn Thompson. Morgan has been married to Jeffrey Winston since June 2009.

<text>Marcy Lynn Walker (born November 26, 1961), also known as Marcy Smith, is an American youth minister and former actress known for her television appearances on daytime soap operas. Her most famous roles are those of Liza Colby on &quot;All My Children&quot;, which she played from 1981 to 1984 and 1995 to 2005, and as Eden Capwell on &quot; Santa Barbara&quot; from 1984 to 1991.

==Personal life==

Walker was born in Paducah, Kentucky and traveled the world during her youth. She lived in Lancaster, California from 1975 to 1978 and attended Antelope Valley High School there. After her junior year, she moved to Troy, Illinois and attended Triad High School where she was active in the drama club and graduated from there in 1979.

Marcy has one son, Taylor, from her third husband, Stephan Collins. In 1999, she married Doug Smith and goes by the name Marcy Smith in her private life. At one point, she was romantically involved with former &quot;All My Children&quot; costar Michael E. Knight, who played Tad Martin on the show. She was briefly engaged to actor Bronson Pinchot during the mid-1980s. From 1985 to 1987, she was married to actor Billy Warlock.

==Acting background==

In 1981, Walker was cast in her first acting job on a daytime serial as Liza Colby on the ABC Television soap opera, &quot;All My Children&quot;. (She had turned down an offer to join the cast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.) She was honored with two Outstanding Supporting Actress Daytime Emmy nominations in 1983 and 1984. After a successful three-year run, she decided to leave the show for other opportunities. She was replaced promptly with actress Alice Haining, as Liza Colby on the show.

In 1984, Walker created another popular soap opera role in the form of Eden Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. Her character, partnered with A Martinez&#x27;s character, Cruz Castillo, became one of the period&#x27;s most popular supercouples. For this role, Walker received three more Daytime Emmy nominations, this time in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress. She won the award in 1989 for an emotional storyline in which her character was brutally beaten and raped. She left the show in 1991.

In 1993, she started playing the role of Tangie Hill on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. While the role was created specifically for Walker, the character didn&#x27;t catch on with the audience and Walker declined to renew her contract. Walker left the show in mid-1995 before making a long-awaited comeback appearance as Liza Colby on &quot;All My Children&quot; in September of that year. In 2001, she was nominated for another Outstanding Lead Actress Daytime Emmy award.

On August 5, 2004, &quot;The Wilton Bulletin&quot;, a Connecticut newspaper, reported Walker&#x27;s intention to become a full-time children&#x27;s ministry director at Hope Church in Wilton, Connecticut upon the expiration of her ABC Television contract the following September. The actress had been interviewed for the article on July 20, 2004. On August 20, 2004, Dan J Kroll of soapcentral.com reported that Walker&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot; contract had not been renewed. Her farewell appearance on &quot;All My Children&quot; aired on September 28, 2004.

The exit of Liza Colby occurred amid rumor that Walker would return to the show on a recurring basis. This rumor was fueled by the fact that her exit was very open-ended. She was not killed off, like some notable fan favorites like Jesse Hubbard, played by Darnell Williams, but rather assumed a new identity. Her character simply decided to take her daughter to live out of reach from her controlling ex-husband Adam Chandler, played by David Canary.

According to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; magazine, Walker was at first hesitant to go on a recurring basis, but later warmed to the idea. In December 2004, the writers created a scene where Liza appeared making a phone call. Walker appeared again in January 2005, when her character assisted Babe Carey Chandler and Jamie Martin, in their attempt to flee from Adam&#x27;s wrath. The characters of Babe and Jamie were played by Alexa Havins and Justin Bruening.

Former head writer Megan McTavish spoke to the soap media and publicly thanked Walker for working without a contract, but also hinted that she did not intend for Liza to return to the show any time soon. However, in 2009, the character of Liza returned, albeit played this time by actress Jamie Luner.

After Walker left &quot;All My Children&quot;, she decided to accept a position in Christian ministry based in Huntersville, North Carolina.

In addition to her work with daytime soap operas, Walker has starred in several movies of the week, including &quot;The Return of Desperado&quot;, &quot;Bar Girls&quot;, &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Child&quot;, and &quot;Terror In the Shadows&quot;.

Walker did not participate in the &quot;All My Children&quot; reunion that was featured on the February 2, 2017 edition of the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; show. However, &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; did utilize footage of Walker with Michael E. Knight from the &quot;All My Children&quot; storyline where Knight&#x27;s Tad Martin character had affairs with both Liza Colby and her mother Marian (played by Jennifer Bassey).

Walker has been confirmed to appear at the Santa Barbara 40th Anniversary event to be held in Burbank, California on August 2-5, 2024.

==Ministry background==

In early 2005, after juggling two roles, one as an actress and another working part-time in her home church, Hope Church, in Wilton, Connecticut, she decided to pursue Christian youth ministry on a full-time basis. In 2005, she began working at Lake Forest Church in Huntersville, North Carolina as their Director of Children&#x27;s Ministry. On July 22, 2010, she announced on her Facebook page that she was resigning her position on staff with the church to take a position at another Charlotte-area church. The Mission Pastor of her former church once said &quot;Marcy is the coolest.&quot;
In 2011, Marcy joined the staff of LifeChurch.tv at their Edmond, OK campus.
