<doc id="691162" wikidata="Q17052924" url="?curid=691162" title="List of English words of Māori origin">
<text>The following English words are loanwords from the Māori language. Many of them concern native New Zealand flora and fauna that were known prior to the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand. Other terms relate to Māori customs. All of these words are commonly encountered in New Zealand English, and several (such as &quot;kiwi&quot;) are widely used across other varieties of English, and in other languages.

The Māori alphabet includes both long and short vowels, which change the meaning of words. For most of the 20th century, these were not indicated by spelling, except sometimes as double vowels (&quot;paaua&quot;). Since the 1980s, the standard way to indicate long vowels is with a macron (&quot;pāua&quot;). Since about 2015, macrons have rapidly become standard usage for Māori loanwords in New Zealand English in media, law, government, and education. Recently some anglicised words have been replaced with spellings that better reflect the original Māori word (Whanganui for Wanganui, Remutaka for Rimutaka).

==Flora and fauna==
The accepted English common names of a number of species of animal and plant native to New Zealand are simply their Māori names or a close equivalent:

==Placenames==
Thousands of Māori placenames (with or without anglicisation) are now official in New Zealand. These include:

* Territorial authorities: Waikato, Manawatū, Tauranga, Taranaki, Otago
* Cities: Porirua, Rotorua, Tauranga, Timaru, Whanganui, Whangārei
* Tourist destinations: Aoraki / Mount Cook, Tongariro, Manapouri, Moeraki, Wakatipu, Te Anau, Waitomo

Many New Zealand rivers and lakes have Māori names; these names predominantly use the prefixes &quot;wai-&quot; (water) and &quot;roto-&quot; (lake) respectively. Examples include the Waikato, Waipa and Waimakariri rivers, and lakes Rotorua, Rotomahana and Rotoiti.

Some Treaty of Waitangi settlements have included placename changes.

A Māori name for New Zealand, &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, has gained some currency as a more acceptable alternative. It appears in the names of some political parties, e.g. Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand and Communist Party of Aotearoa.

<text>John Patrick (May 17, 1905November 7, 1995) was an American playwright and screenwriter.

==Biography==
He was born John Patrick Goggin in Louisville, Kentucky. His parents soon abandoned him, and he spent a delinquent youth in foster homes and boarding schools. At age 19, he secured a job as an announcer at KPO Radio in San Francisco, California, marrying Mildred Legaye in 1925. He wrote over 1,000 scripts for the &quot;Cecil and Sally&quot; radio program (originally titled &quot;The Funniest Things&quot;), broadcast between 1928 and 1933. The show&#x27;s sole actors were Patrick and Helen Troy. In 1937, Patrick wrote adaptations for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Streamlined Shakespeare&quot; series, guest-starring Helen Hayes.

Produced on a tight budget, his first play, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, directed by Joshua Logan, had a brief run on Broadway in 1935. However, the credit opened the door for him as a Hollywood scriptwriter. 

His unpublished play &quot;Glory Lane,&quot; was premiered in January 1935, at the Golden Bough Playhouse in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California by Ralph Bell.

In 1942, the play, &quot;The Willow and I&quot;, was produced with Martha Scott and Gregory Peck in the starring roles. Before its first night, Patrick had volunteered for the American Field Service providing medical services in support of the British Army fighting World War II. He served with Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army in Egypt and subsequently saw action in India and Burma where the ideas for his next play &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; were germinated. Patrick completed the play on the ship that returned him to the U.S. after the war, and it proved a great commercial success, being adapted for the screen in 1949, with Ronald Reagan as the star and for TV in 1983.

His next two plays, &quot;The Curious Savage&quot; (1950) and &quot;Lo and Behold&quot; (1951), fared less well, but it was his 1953 stage adaptation of Vern J. Sneider&#x27;s novel &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; that marked the height of his fame, winning both the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award for drama. He adapted the play for the screen in 1956 and for the musical stage under the title &quot;Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen&quot; in 1970. In 1954, he wrote the screenplay for the movie &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; and in 1955, he adapted the autobiographical book &quot;A Many-Splendoured Thing&quot; by Han Suyin, for the movie &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot;.

His next play, &quot;Good as Gold&quot; (1957), was less well received, and most of the rest of his career was dedicated to a series of successful screenwriting assignments. Following his success with &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;, Patrick bought the estate Hasty Hill at Suffern, New York. He later moved to Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands.

On November 7, 1995, the 90-year-old playwright was found dead in his room with a plastic bag over his head. His death was ruled a suicide. Patrick is now best remembered for his screen work though his plays remain popular with community theatres.

The John Patrick Collection, including the playwright&#x27;s books, letters, and manuscripts is held at the Rare Book Department of Boston University.

<text>Slovene literature is the literature written in Slovene. It spans across all literary genres with historically the Slovene historical fiction as the most widespread Slovene fiction genre. The Romantic 19th-century epic poetry written by the leading name of the Slovene literary canon, France Prešeren, inspired virtually all subsequent Slovene literature.

Literature played an important role in the development and preservation of Slovene identity because the Slovene nation did not have its own state until 1991 after the Republic of Slovenia emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia. Poetry, narrative prose, drama, essay, and criticism kept the Slovene language and culture alive, allowing—in the words of Anton Slodnjak—the Slovenes to become a real nation, particularly in the absence of &quot;masculine&quot; attributes such as political power and authority.

==Early literature==
There are accounts that cite the existence of an oral literary tradition that preceded the Slovene written literature. This was mostly composed of folk songs and also prose, which included tales of myths, fairy tales, and narrations.

===First written text===
The earliest documents written in Old Slovene are the Freising manuscripts (&quot;Brižinski spomeniki&quot;), dated between 972 and 1022, found in 1803 in Freising, Germany. This book was written for the purpose of spreading Christianity to the Alpine Slavs and contained terms concerned with the institutions of authority such as &quot;oblast&quot; (authority), &quot;gospod&quot; (lord), and &quot;rota&quot; (oath).

===First books===
The first printed books in Slovene were &quot;Catechismus&quot; and &quot;Abecedarium&quot;, written by the Protestant reformer Primož Trubar in 1550 and printed in Schwäbisch Hall. Based on the work by Trubar, who from 1555 until 1577 translated into Slovene and published the entire New Testament, Jurij Dalmatin translated the entire Bible into Slovene from c. 1569 until 1578 and published it in 1583. In the second half of the 16th century, Slovene became known to other European languages with the multilingual dictionary, compiled by Hieronymus Megiser. Since then each new generation of Slovene writers has contributed to the growing corpus of texts in Slovene. Particularly, Adam Bohorič&#x27;s &quot;Arcticae horulae&quot;, the first Slovene grammar, and Sebastjan Krelj&#x27;s &quot;Postilla Slovenska&quot;, became the bases of the development of Slovene literature.

Intimism () was a poetic movement, the main themes of which were love, disappointment and suffering and the projection of poet&#x27;s inner feelings onto nature. Its beginner is Ivan Minatti, who was followed by Lojze Krakar. The climax of Intimism was achieved in 1953 with a collection of poetry titled &quot;Poems of the Four&quot; (), written by Janez Menart, Ciril Zlobec, Kajetan Kovič and Tone Pavček. An often neglected female counterpart to the four was Ada Škerl, whose subjective and pessimistic poetic sentiment was contrary to the post-war revolutionary demands in the People&#x27;s Republic of Slovenia.

<doc id="691181" wikidata="Q176544" url="?curid=691181" title="California Girls">
<text>&quot;California Girls&quot; is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1965 album &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. Written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, the lyrics were partly inspired by the band&#x27;s experiences touring Europe for the first time, detailing an appreciation for women across the world. It was released as a single, backed with &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot;, and reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was also a top 10 hit in several other countries, becoming one of the band&#x27;s most successful songs globally.

Wilson conceived &quot;California Girls&quot; during his first acid trip while thinking about women and Western film scores. The song is distinguished for its orchestral prelude, layered vocals, and chromaticism. Wilson later referred to it as &quot;a hymn to youth&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;anthem&quot;, and his favorite record by the group, although he remained dissatisfied with their vocal performance. It was the band&#x27;s first recording with touring musician Bruce Johnston, who was not yet an official member of the group.

&quot;California Girls&quot; inspired the Beatles&#x27; parody &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and many songs with similar or identical titles, including Big Star&#x27;s &quot;September Gurls&quot;, the Magnetic Fields&#x27; &quot;California Girls&quot;, and Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;California Gurls&quot;. In 1984, David Lee Roth recorded a cover version that also peaked at number 3. In 2010, the Beach Boys&#x27; recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 72 on its list of the greatest songs of all time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Background==
Brian Wilson, according to some accounts, was inspired to write &quot;California Girls&quot; during his first time taking the psychedelic drug LSD, an occasion supervised by his friend Loren Schwartz. Wilson corroborated in the 2004 documentary &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; that he had written the song while on his first acid trip, but in the 2021 documentary &quot;Long Promised Road&quot;, he stated that he wrote the song during the week after the trip, when he was sober.

In a 2007 interview, Wilson explained that he had gone to his piano and &quot;was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that.&quot; He said that &quot;California Girls&quot; was intended to encapsulate the feel of the Drifters&#x27; version of &quot;On Broadway&quot;. and on other occasions, said that the shuffle beat in the song was influenced by Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;.

The next day, as Wilson recalled, he and his bandmate Mike Love finished the remainder of the song. Love was not originally listed as the song&#x27;s co-writer, but was awarded a credit after his successful 1990s lawsuit for songwriting credits. He said that he approached Wilson about the omission when the song was released, and that Wilson had told him that the mistake was the fault of Wilson&#x27;s father Murry, the band&#x27;s publisher. In a 1988 interview, Brian blamed himself. &quot;I knew that my dad made a mistake by putting my name on there only.&quot; Session musician Carol Kaye, who played on the recording, credited all the music to Wilson, with the only exception being a bass fill she invented at the end of the bridge section.

Wilson and Love later disagreed over the extent of their lyrical contributions. Love said that he wrote &quot;every syllable&quot; of the song apart from &quot;I wish they all could be California girls&quot;. In his recollection, he wrote the lyrics &quot;in less than an hour&quot; while he was in the hallway of the recording studio during the session for the backing track. Wilson disputed Love&#x27;s assertion. &quot;I wrote a lot of those lyrics too; it was line for line, back and forth between us. That&#x27;s what happened.&quot; He said that he came up with the opening lines and subject matter, and that &quot;Every other line was his or mine. ... Everybody loves girls, right? Everybody loves California and the sun. That’s what I wanted from the song. And to mention all the parts of the country, that’s fun, people will like that.&quot;

==Lyrics==
The lyrics describe an appreciation for the qualities of girls from different regions of the United States, and the wish that &quot;they all could be&quot; in the narrator&#x27;s home state of California. Among the qualities that the narrator appreciates are &quot;East Coast girls&quot; for being &quot;hip&quot;, &quot;southern girls&quot; for &quot;the way they talk&quot;, the &quot;northern girls&quot; for &quot;the way they kiss&quot;, and the &quot;Midwest farmer&#x27;s daughter&quot; for making &quot;you feel all right&quot;. After the first chorus, the West Coast is invoked for its &quot;sunshine&quot; and tanned girls, with an additional reference to a &quot;French bikini on Hawaii Island&quot;. At the end of the lyric, the singer declares that, having had the experience of seeing &quot;all kinds of girls&quot; from &quot;all around this great big world&quot;, the U.S. contains &quot;the cutest&quot; of them all.

According to Love, the lyrics were inspired by the band&#x27;s first time touring Europe and the UK in November 1964. He felt that he failed to impart the message that he had &quot;originally intended&quot; with the lyric. &quot;I wanted the song to be a tribute to girls everywhere—not just in the United States, let alone California, but everywhere in the world.&quot; Biographer Mark Dillon wrote that Love&#x27;s lyrics &quot;show [that he keeps] concert-goers top of mind&quot; and that the &quot;Midwest farmer&#x27;s daughter&quot; line elicited the greatest applause when the group performed the song live.

==Composition==
&quot;California Girls&quot; begins with an orchestral prelude and contains a similar chord sequence and call-and-response vocal lines as Wilson&#x27;s previous song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; from &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot;. According to writer Maury Dean, &quot;Musically, &#x27;California Girls&#x27; is an adventure in chromatics; any garage band trying to follow their bizarre VII tidal wave of dipping and swooping chromatic major chords will have to buy the sheet music, or hire Sherlock Holmes to find the missing chords.&quot; Musicologist Walter Everett identifies the use of VII — IV in the chorus to suggest a chromaticized major key with minor pentatonic inflections.

Music theorist Daniel Harrison compared the song to Wilson&#x27;s later &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, as both songs avoid a root-position tonic and suppress a cadential drive. The refrain alternates between the I and ii7 without ever meeting the expected V. Highlighting this, Harrison, citing an insight on the part of Everett, writes that the &quot;wish that &#x27;they all could be California girls&#x27; is, of course, impossible to realize; the inability of I-II to reach V, then, underscores this impossibility.&quot;

==Recording==
On April 6, 1965, Wilson produced the backing track of &quot;California Girls&quot; (then given the working title &quot;We Don&#x27;t Know&quot;) with a host of session musicians at Western Studio in Hollywood. It required 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance, with the session concluding after midnight. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players.

The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Grass and I&#x27;m a Power Mower&quot;. In his 2016 memoir, Wilson remembered: &quot;When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl&#x27;s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. &#x27;Can he play it in the booth?&#x27; Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but it seemed like a good idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra.&quot; According to biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Wilson&#x27;s father Murry urged Brian to eliminate the orchestral prelude, as he felt that it made the song excessively complex.

&quot;California Girls&quot; was the first Beach Boys recording to feature vocals from Bruce Johnston, who had recently joined the group to substitute for Wilson on concert tours. Johnston remembered, &quot;I came home from The Beach Boys&#x27; tour [on June 1] and they said, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you come and sing on our next album?&#x27; The first song I sang on was &#x27;California Girls&#x27;. At this point I still wasn&#x27;t a proper member of the group.&quot;

Vocal overdubs followed on June 4 at Columbia studio. Wilson recorded the Beach Boys&#x27; vocals using Columbia&#x27;s new 8-track recorder, allowing Love&#x27;s and Brian&#x27;s lead vocals to be double-tracked and the group&#x27;s vocals spread over three more. According to historian Keith Badman, the song had still lacked &quot;a proper title&quot;, as Wilson can be heard referring to it as &quot;Yeah, I Dig the Girls&quot; on the session tape.

==Release==
On July 5, 1965, &quot;California Girls&quot; was released as the leading track on side two of the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. On July 12, it was issued as a single backed with &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot;. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard Top 40&quot; chart at number 28, and at the end of August peaked at number 3, just below the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. In the UK, the single was released in August. In September, it peaked at number 28 in the Netherlands. In October, it peaked at number 26 in the UK, 30 in Germany and 6 in Sweden.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; described the single as an &quot;easy-going shuffle which touts the many positive aspects of the Golden Gate state distaffers.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; described it as a &quot;ballad with a beat extolling the Coast female&quot; and called it an &quot;extremely strong item.&quot;

The Beach Boys sang the song over a pre-recorded backing track during their appearances on the television programs &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; (on October 22) and &quot;Jack Benny Hour&quot; (on October 23). In the latter, the group were featured in a humorous sketch with host Jack Benny and comedian Bob Hope, who act as old surfers that are struggling to understand the sport&#x27;s slang terms.

==Recognition and legacy==

&quot;California Girls&quot; is among the Beach Boys&#x27; most commercially successful songs globally. It has been performed thousands of times in concert as the band&#x27;s opening number. Carlin called the orchestral introduction &quot;as spare and stirring as anything by Aaron Copland&quot;. Dillon referred to the passage as &quot;one of pop music&#x27;s great intros&quot; and &quot;Brian&#x27;s proclamation to the rest of the music biz that he was a composer to take seriously&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist Geoff Boucher, writing in his article about the song, said that the opening lyrics were &quot;one of the most famous ... in pop music&quot; and described the music as &quot;equal parts symphony hall and amusement park, 2 1/2 minutes of nuanced musical complexity and beach-blanket simplicity.&quot; The song was also influential in the development of the power pop genre.

Wilson stated in an interview, &quot;The intro to this song is the greatest piece of music I&#x27;ve ever written ... The song was a big record for us but I never really liked anything but the intro.&quot; In 1970, he said that he disliked the recorded vocal performance and added, &quot;If I could, I&#x27;d re-record that one ... We rushed the beat on that one.&quot; In 2010, he told Dillon that it was the band&#x27;s finest record and said, &quot;You could call it our anthem.&quot;

In 2010, the Beach Boys&#x27; recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its &quot;lasting qualitative or historical significance.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it number 72 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, where it was described as &quot;tougher than earlier Beach Boys hits, with tightly wound harmonies and an aggressive lead vocal.&quot;

===Cultural references===
The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; (1968) features a bridge section based on the song. Wilson said that the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;&quot;blew&quot; my mind&quot; when he first heard it, although he did not realize that it was a send-up of &quot;California Girls&quot; until the fact was pointed out to him. Strawberry Alarm Clock, who toured with the Beach Boys in 1966–67, segues into the intro and first line of &quot;California Girls&quot; at the end of their song &quot;Small Package&quot;, on their album &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; (1969). &quot;California Girls&quot; has also been adopted in numerous television commercials and jingles. It served as a tongue-in-cheek musical cue in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985).

&quot;California Girls&quot; inspired the titles of Big Star&#x27;s &quot;September Gurls&quot; (1974) and identically-named songs by Gretchen Wilson (from her 2006 album &quot;All Jacked Up&quot;) and the Magnetic Fields (from their 2008 album &quot;Distortion&quot;). The latter song describes a protagonist who wishes to murder upper-class girls from California with a battle axe, a theme that carried on from Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Expressway to Yr. Skull&quot; from &quot;Evol&quot; (1986). Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;California Gurls&quot; (2010) initiated a dispute with publisher Rondor Music regarding its use of the lyric &quot;I wish they all could be California girls&quot;.

Magnetic Fields frontman Stephin Merritt commented on the various songs, &quot;when I wrote [my] &#x27;California Girls&#x27; ... the listener is supposed to know that there is already a song with that title. ... It would be good to write a response song to that [Katy Perry single]. An answer song, to be called &#x27;California Grrrls,&#x27; g-r-r-r-l-s, about the Riot Grrrl alleged movement. One could go on and on with &#x27;California Girls,&#x27; it’s a pretty large topic, with a lot to say.&quot;

===David Lee Roth version===


&quot;California Girls&quot; was covered by David Lee Roth on his 1985 EP &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot; (with background vocals by Beach Boy Carl Wilson along with Christopher Cross). Like the original, it peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Federico Fellini-esque music video, directed by Pete Angelus and Roth and inspired by Fellini&#x27;s Amarcord, was released in January 1985.

In the video, Roth stars as a tour guide, showing tourists (one played by Jane Leeves, who went on to play &quot;Frasier&quot;″s Daphne Moon), the beach and swimsuit models. The female bodybuilder in the video is actress and writer, Teagan Clive. The scenes follow the lyrics with bikini-clad women from all regions of the US. An oft-imitated scene has Roth dancing down a sidewalk bordered by models frozen like mannequins. &quot;That is Diamond Dave, the character,&quot; he observed. &quot;That is definitely a part of me: I grew up in that whole Southern California thing. I dee-lite in it! But you don&#x27;t have to be there to celebrate the spirit.&quot;

<text>Mayo Jane Methot (March 3, 1904 – June 9, 1951) was an American film and stage actress. She appeared in over 30 films, as well as in various Broadway productions, and attracted significant media attention for her tempestuous marriage to actor Humphrey Bogart.

Methot appeared in numerous Broadway musicals and plays, including the Vincent Youmans musical &quot;Great Day&quot; (1929). She then appeared in various supporting roles for Warner Brothers, often portraying hard-edged women. Her film credits include the mystery film &quot;The Night Club Lady&quot; (1932), the comedy &quot;Jimmy the Gent&quot; (1934), and the crime drama &quot;Marked Woman&quot; (1937).

Methot met Bogart on the set of &quot;Marked Woman&quot; and the two became romantically involved, marrying in 1938. Methot struggled with severe alcoholism, and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia following a suicide attempt in 1943. She divorced Bogart in 1945 after numerous reconciliations. Unable to gain traction in her film career, she returned to her native Portland, and her alcoholism and depression worsened. She died of complications stemming from alcoholism in 1951, aged 47.

==Life and career==
===1904–1922: Early life and career beginnings===
Mayo Jane Methot was born March 3, 1904, in Chicago, Illinois, the only child of Beryl Evelyn (née Wood) and John Dillon &quot;Jack&quot; Methot, a ship captain. She was a direct descendant of Zachary Taylor, the 12th President of the United States. Shortly after her birth, the family relocated to Portland, Oregon, where Methot was raised. She showed a proclivity for literature and acting as a young child, memorizing passages from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. She began performing on stage professionally at the age of five, appearing as Josef in a Portland production of &quot;Sapho&quot;, opposite Florence Roberts.

In 1912, Methot starred as David, a young boy, in a production of &quot;The Awakening of Helena Richie&quot;, at the Grand Opera House in Salem, Oregon. In an article detailing the play, it was noted: &quot;Her grasp of what is required of her during rehearsals of plays is held to be most unusual, while those who have seen her as David in &quot;The Awakening of Helena Richie,&quot; are warm in their praise of her dramatic ability.&quot; In press promoting the production, the then-eight-year-old Methot stated that she was inspired by French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Around this time, she told reporter Fay King of &quot;The Spectator&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m going to be a fine actress, if I can.&quot;
Methot was subsequently chosen to travel with selected Portland delegates to Washington, D.C. where she presented President Woodrow Wilson with a bouquet of flowers. Methot began performing with the Portland-based Baker Stock Company at age nine, and her frequent appearances in local theater productions earned Methot the nickname &quot;The Portland Rosebud.&quot; In 1914, she made her film debut alongside several Baker Stock Company players in a serial short titled &quot;Forgotten Songs&quot;, produced by the Portland-based American Lifeograph Studios. In January 1916, she starred as the lead in a Baker Stock Company production of &quot;The Littlest Rebel&quot;.

After Methot graduated from Miss Catlin&#x27;s School in 1919, she pursued a full-time career with the Baker Stock Company, appearing in an August 1919 production of &quot;Come Out of the Kitchen&quot; opposite Verna Felton. This was followed by lead roles in the company&#x27;s &quot;Dawn o&#x27; the Mountains&quot; (staged in May 1920), in which she portrayed a teenage boy; as a bride&#x27;s sister seeking a lover in &quot;Parlor, Bedroom and Bath&quot; (October 1920); and in the comedy &quot;That Girl Patsy&quot;, in May 1921.

While appearing in locally produced serial short films for filmmaker Robert C. Bruce (among them the 1922-released &quot;And Women Must Weep&quot;), Methot met cameraman Jack Lamond, a war veteran, and the two began a whirlwind romance in the summer of 1921. On September 21 of that year, they married at Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Vancouver, Washington. Methot continued to perform in local productions with the Baker Stock Company, including &quot;Linger Longer Letty&quot; in November 1921, and in a revival of &quot;Parlor, Bedroom and Bath&quot; in March 1922. In November 1922, Methot and Lamond relocated to New York City, where Lamond was employed at Cosmopolitan Productions.

===1923–1929: Broadway career===
Shortly after her arrival in New York, Methot began appearing on Broadway, her first production being director William Brady&#x27;s &quot;The Mad Honeymoon&quot; in the summer of 1923. Though the play received unfavorable reviews from critics, Mayo was the lone member of the cast to not receive criticism for her performance.

Based on her performance in &quot;The Mad Honeymoon&quot;, Methot was cast as the female lead of Leola Lane in George M. Cohan&#x27;s production of &quot;The Song and Dance Man&quot;, which opened on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1923. In 1924, she appeared as The Bride in a Philadelphia production of Owen Davis&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted House&quot;. The following year, she returned to Broadway as Phyllis Halladay in &quot;Alias the Deacon&quot;, opposite Berton Churchill. This was followed by a 1927 production of &quot;The Medicine Man&quot;, staged by Sam H. Harris at the New Cort Theatre in Queens, New York City. On December 30, 1927, Methot and Lamond divorced, after she asserted that he had deserted her in 1925.

Methot&#x27;s performance as Florence Wendell in a winter 1929 Broadway production of &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; garnered her praise from Donald Mulhern of the &quot;Brooklyn Standard Union&quot;, who wrote that she &quot;handles her emotional scenes with both art and warmth and makes the woman very real.&quot; She subsequently originated a role in the Vincent Youmans/Billy Rose musical &quot;Great Day&quot; (1929), introducing the standard &quot;More Than You Know&quot; and several others. Her subsequent performance in &quot;Half Gods&quot; (also 1929) at the Plymouth Theatre earned critical praise, with Alvin Kayton of &quot;The Brooklyn Citizen&quot; writing: &quot;As Hope Ferrier, Mayo Methot, recently in Youmans&#x27; &quot;Great Day&quot;, was extraordinarily capable, expressing her part with an emotion and understanding which made Hope seem almost lifelike. We doubt if the role could have been bettered.&quot;

===1930–1937: Move to Hollywood===
Methot moved to Hollywood in 1930, hoping to transition from stage to a career in film. She had her first major speaking role in United Artists&#x27;s gangster film &quot;Corsair&quot; (1931). On November 28, 1931, Methot married Percy T. Morgan, an oil tycoon and the co-owner with John &quot;Jack&quot; Morgan, of the Cock n&#x27; Bull restaurant on Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard, birthplace of the Moscow Mule.

In 1932, after signing a contract with Warner Bros., Methot starred as the female lead in &quot;The Night Club Lady&quot;, a murder mystery co-starring Adolphe Menjou. What followed was a long line of roles as unsympathetic second leads and tough-talking &quot;dames&quot; in many of Warner&#x27;s contemporary crime melodramas, such as &quot;The Mind Reader&quot; and William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot; (both 1933), as well as &quot;Jimmy the Gent&quot; (1934) opposite Jimmy Cagney and Bette Davis. In 1934, she had roles in three First National Pictures features: first as a nurse in the drama &quot;Registered Nurse&quot;, followed by supporting parts in &quot;Side Streets&quot; and &quot;Mills of the Gods&quot;.

Methot followed this with minor parts in the Perry Mason mystery film &quot;The Case of the Curious Bride&quot;, and as a gangster&#x27;s moll in the crime film &quot;Dr. Socrates&quot; (both released in 1935). She was subsequently cast in the crime drama &quot;Marked Woman&quot; (1937), again starring opposite Davis and Humphrey Bogart. Methot divorced her husband, Percy Morgan, in February 1937, claiming that he would not allow her to accept an acting role in New York City.

===1938–1944: Marriage to Humphrey Bogart===
Methot became romantically involved with Humphrey Bogart after co-starring with him in &quot;Marked Woman&quot;. The couple were married on August 28, 1938, in Beverly Hills. Bogart had been married to actresses Helen Menken and Mary Philips before marrying Methot, and blamed his previous divorces on his wives&#x27; careers and their long separations. Two years after Methot and Bogart were married, Methot gave up acting. The two became a high-profile Hollywood couple, but it was not a smooth marriage. Both drank heavily, and Methot gained a reputation for her violent excesses when under the influence. They became known in the press as &quot;The Battling Bogarts&quot;, with Methot known, due to her combativeness, as &quot;Sluggy&quot;. Bogart later named his motor yacht &quot;Sluggy&quot; in her honor. After Methot attempted suicide in 1943, Bogart urged her to visit a psychiatrist, and upon doing so, she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

During World War II, the Bogarts traveled Europe entertaining the troops. At one point in their travels during the war, the Bogarts met with director John Huston in Italy. During a night of heavy drinking, Methot insisted that everyone listen to her perform a song. Though they tried to persuade her to desist, she sang anyway. The performance was so bad and embarrassing that Huston and Bogart remembered it several years later and based a scene in &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) on the incident, having the alcoholic girlfriend (played by Claire Trevor) of the mobster (played by Edward G. Robinson) struggle through &quot;Moanin&#x27; Low&quot; off key in hopes of winning a drink in exchange for her singing. Trevor won an Oscar for her performance in the film.
Numerous battles took place at the Hollywood residence of the famous couple, nicknamed Sluggy Hollow, including one in which Methot stabbed Bogart in the shoulder, and another in which the two hit one another in the head with whiskey bottles. Actress Gloria Stuart—a friend of Bogart and Methot—recalled, in her later years, attending a dinner party at which Methot drunkenly brandished a pistol and threatened to shoot Bogart. Stuart also recalled seeing Methot with bruises on her face on several occasions, and witnessing physical fights between the couple, including one in which Bogart tore Methot&#x27;s dress off of her. The couple separated and reconciled several times over the course of their marriage.

While filming &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; in 1943, Bogart fell in love with his 19-year old co-star Lauren Bacall and the couple began an affair. Methot caught wind of it and visited the set often. Bogart attempted to save the marriage but Methot&#x27;s alcoholism intensified, as did their fighting. Bogart announced that he had moved out of the couple&#x27;s home on October 19, 1944. On October 30, Bogart announced that he had reconciled with Methot and that he was &quot;going home. [...] In other words, we&#x27;ll return to our normal battles.&quot; The reconciliation proved short lived; Methot announced that Bogart had moved out of their home yet again on December 3, 1944.

===1945–1951: Career decline and return to Oregon===
Methot filed for divorce on May 10, 1945, in a Las Vegas court, which was granted one hour after she filed for the decree. Bogart married Lauren Bacall on May 21, 1945. After the divorce, Methot retreated from the public eye for several months, and spent a period at the Malabar Farm State Park (the location of Bogart and Bacall&#x27;s wedding).

In August 1945, Methot attempted to resume a stage career in New York. However, she was unsuccessful, and became locked into a pattern of alcoholism and depression. In the late 1940s, she moved back to Oregon where her mother helped take care of her.

==Death==
Methot died on June 9, 1951, at Holladay Park Hospital in Portland. Although it was reported in the press at the time that Methot died of complications from an unspecified surgery, her actual cause of death was attributed to acute alcoholism. Methot left her estate, totaling $50,000 to her mother Evelyn. Additionally, she bestowed her personal library of classic books to the Catlin Gabel School, her alma mater, as well a scholarship fund for the institution.

Methot&#x27;s remains are interred at the Portland Memorial Mausoleum in the Sellwood neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, alongside her parents. Bogart continued to send flowers to Methot&#x27;s crypt until his death in 1957.

From 1 December 2013, Teletext Holidays moved from advertising holidays from 14 holiday suppliers (including Qwerty Travel, Lowcost Travel Group and Hays Travel) to working with one supplier, Truly Travel.

==Closure==
Teletext Cars closed on 2 February 2007. 

On 21 January 2009, Ofcom reported that &quot;The increasing availability of text based services, both broadcast and online may mean that post 2014 there is no longer clear justification for continued intervention to maintain a public service teletext licence.&quot;

On 16 July 2009, DMGT announced that due to competition from the Internet, current economic conditions and Ofcom&#x27;s findings, the service would cease broadcasting most of its services on analogue and digital television, with the exception of the commercial services broadcast on Freeview channels 101-107 such as Teletext Holidays and the firm&#x27;s profitable travel websites in January 2010, with the switch off date subsequently brought forward to 14 December 2009 (Sky Digital) and 15 December 2009 (analogue TV, Freesat and Freeview).

Teletext&#x27;s news and information service were removed from: ITV, Channel 4 and Five on analogue TV; ITV and Channel 4 on Sky Digital; ITV, Channel 4 and channel 100 on Freeview; editorial on Teletext Extra on Freeview; editorial on ch 986 on Freesat. The GameCentral section continued online on the Teletext website before joining another DMGT website Metro, renamed Metro Gaming.

Despite the withdrawal of news and information content, the service continued to broadcast. On 29 January 2010, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom revoked Teletext&#x27;s licence to broadcast. On 27 May 2010, Ofcom imposed a financial penalty of £225,000 on Teletext Limited for ceasing to provide part of its service whilst its licence was still extant. Ofcom regulations state: &quot;Public service broadcasting licences are offered for a fixed term, requiring the holder to provide the licensed service throughout the licence period. In accepting a licence, the broadcaster takes account of the likely cost of the obligations under the licence, and the value of the benefits associated with the licence, for the duration of the licence period.&quot; Teletext&#x27;s licence was for the licence period 2004 to 2014.

The main Teletext service on Freeview was removed from channel 100 on the EPG on 21 June 2010. Teletext Holidays went digital in January 2011. In a deal between BBC Worldwide and Inview Technology Ltd, Teletext Extra was relaunched as Radio Times Extra on 31 January 2011, with editorial content from the &quot;Radio Times&quot; instead of Teletext Ltd.

Teletext formally closed down on 28 June 2012, but Teletext Holidays finally closed on 1 October 2012.

==Other teletext services==

In spite of its name, the &quot;Teletext&quot;-branded service was neither the first nor the only teletext service in the UK. The BBC (one of the original developers of teletext) launched its Ceefax teletext service in 1974, the same year that &quot;Teletext&#x27;s&quot; predecessor, ORACLE, also appeared. Although ORACLE closed at the end of 1992 (when Teletext Ltd outbid it for the franchise), Ceefax continued to run on BBC analogue channels until the cessation of analogue signals in October 2012.

FourText, originally called 4-Tel, was first run in conjunction with ORACLE, as an auxiliary teletext provider for Channel 4 from 1982. 4-Tel occupied pages 410–469 within ORACLE&#x27;s page space. When ORACLE lost its licence and was replaced by Teletext Ltd in 1993, 4-Tel moved to its own page space on pages 300–399 (effectively its own magazine). Channel 4 enlisted Intelfax to run the service. In 2002, 4-Tel was renamed FourText. In addition, FourText also launched on digital television. In 2003, Channel 4 ended their contract with Intelfax and contracted out the service to Teletext Ltd. The new service was named Teletext on 4 and operated on pages 400–499 (which replaced pages 300-399 as Channel 4&#x27;s page space). However, on 30 October 2008, Teletext on 4 on Channel 104 closed and replaced in December 2008 by 1-2-1 Dating. using Teletext on 4&#x27;s old channel number.

<text>&#x27; (, German for &quot;rhinoceros&quot;), initially known as &#x27; (German &quot;hornet&quot;), was a German (&quot;tank hunter&quot;) of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis based on the Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks with the 8.8 cm Pak 43 anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could penetrate the front armour of any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war&#x27;s end.

==Development==
After the first German experiences with the newer Soviet tanks like the T-34 medium tank or the Kliment Voroshilov heavy tank during Operation Barbarossa, the need for a capable of destroying these more heavily armoured tanks became clear.

In February 1942, the Alkett () arms firm of Berlin designed a tank destroyer using their recently developed III/IV chassis which, as its name indicated, used components of both the Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks. The 8.8 cm &quot;Panzerjägerkanone&quot; 43/1 L/71 (PaK 43/1) a long-barreled anti-tank gun (also used, as the 8.8 cm KwK 43, for the main armament of the Tiger II tank) was mounted on the rear of the chassis complete with its gun shield, and an open-topped superstructure was built up around the gun to give the crew some protection. The gun had the same traverse and elevation as if it had been on its carriage: 15° to either side and between -5° and +15° elevation. To accommodate the long and heavy gun, the hull had to be lengthened and the engine moved from the rear to the centre of the chassis. The amount of armour provided for the crew compartment was limited. The shielding provided was adequate to protect the crew from blast and small arms, but not armour-piercing rounds. Thus, like the series, the vehicle was not intended to engage in tank fights, but to provide mobility to a powerful anti-tank gun.

This model was presented for approval to Adolf Hitler in October 1942 and entered production in early 1943. It had numerous official designations, such as 8.8 cm Pak 43 (L/71) III/IV (Sf) or 8.8 cm Pak 43 (L/71) III/IV (Sd. Kfz. 164), though it was also known as the (in English &quot;tank-hunter Hornet&quot;)

During the first half of 1943, a new model of the was introduced into production. This model altered the driver&#x27;s front armour plate, along with other minor differences. This model and its predecessor, the few early production vehicles, were almost indistinguishable. It was renamed by Hitler in 1944.

Total production of the amounted to some 494 vehicles, most of which were built in 1943. In January 1944, Hitler favored production of a newer, fully-casemated tank destroyer, the , which had a much lower silhouette, thicker frontal armor (60 mm frontal plate), and an effective though less powerful 7.5 cm gun. Though still primarily an ambush weapon, this vehicle was better built for armoured engagements. Production of the continued into 1945, although at a slow pace.

==Combat service==

The was issued to the heavy anti-tank battalions (); six would eventually be equipped: 560, 655, 525, 93, 519 and 88. Each battalion was equipped with 45 . Most of the in these units fought either on the Eastern Front or in Italy, few having been sent to Western Europe.

The gun was a variant of the Pak 43, closely related to guns used later for the , Tiger II and . Its tungsten carbide–cored round, the &quot;Pzgr. 40/43&quot;, was capable of penetrating 190 mm of rolled steel armour at a 30° angle of impact at a distance of 1 km. The gun&#x27;s performance enabled to penetrate the front armour plating of any Allied combat vehicle and to engage enemy units while staying out of range themselves, thanks to its combination of excellent gunsights, optics, and accuracy.

The made its debut during the Battle of Kursk in 1943, where it performed extremely well. The ability to engage the enemy at long distances negated the disadvantages of its light armour, lack of a roof and a large profile, and revealed that the weapon was well suited to the open and flat steppes that made up much of the landscape of the western Soviet Union. In Italy, however, the generally hilly terrain was not as favourable to the harnessing of the Nashorn&#x27;s full ability at accurate long-range fire against enemy forces as in Russia.

On 6 March 1945, a US Army M26 Pershing heavy tank was knocked out by a in the town of Niehl near Cologne, at a close range of under 300 yd (270 m).

==Survivors==
There are two on display in military museums: one in the U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Collection and at the new Patriot Park military museum in Moscow, Russia (it was formerly on display in Kubinka Tank Museum).

A third privately owned with the hull serial number 310163 has been restored to running condition in the Netherlands. The hull and a number of the parts came from Kaliningrad. In 2019, this third surviving vehicle had reached the stage where it was driveable when it suffered severe damage after being caught in an accidental garage fire. The restoration has made this operational again. The engine and steering system are not original due to cost. The engine is a Deutz FL12814 V12 while the steering system was taken from an FV432. The tracks were originally of World War II vintage but they proved too brittle and have been replaced with newly manufactured tracks.

<text>St Stephen&#x27;s College (Chinese:聖士提反書院) is a Christian Direct Subsidy Scheme co-educational secondary school in Stanley, Hong Kong. With an area of about 150,000 m2 (15 hectares), the college is the largest secondary school in Hong Kong, and is one of the very few boarding schools in the territory. Many buildings in the campus are listed in the list of historic Buildings and Declared Monuments by the Antiquities Advisory Board. When the college was founded in 1903, there were only six boarders and one day student; in the academic year 2014–2015, there were approximately 910 students studying in the college. The current principal is Mrs Julie Ma, commencing duty since 2023. St Stephen&#x27;s College uses English as the medium of instruction except for Chinese-based subjects. St Stephen&#x27;s College is the first school in the territory having its own Heritage Trail in the school campus. The college&#x27;s oldest building, the School House, was declared a monument in 2011, being one of the few schools in Hong Kong to own a Declared Monument in its campus.

==History==
The establishment of the college dates back to 1901. A group of prominent Chinese businessmen approached the Church Missionary Society to administer a school for their sons. The inspiration came from Sun Yat-sen. The aim was to achieve a standard of teaching and level of equipment comparable to the best public schools in England. In 1903, St Stephen&#x27;s College was officially established on Bonham Road in Western District. In the 1920s, the government granted the school on the Stanley Peninsula in recognition of &quot;outstanding contributions to education&quot;. The foundation stone was laid in April 1928 by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, and in May 1929, the college was fully functional in its new buildings, many of which are still in use today.

During the Battle of Hong Kong in the Second World War, heavy fighting took place around the college, which was among the last British strongholds to surrender to the Imperial Japanese Army. Shortly after the surrender, the Imperial Japanese Army broke into the college (which served as a military hospital during the battle) and murdered wounded soldiers of the Allied forces, in what would be known as the St. Stephen&#x27;s College massacre. The Japanese later merged the college with part of Stanley Prison to form the Stanley Internment Camp.

The college reopened after the war and a chapel was built in 1950 to remember those who died during the Japanese occupation.

Originally a private school, St Stephen&#x27;s College became a government-funded public school during the late 1900s. Since the 2008–2009 academic year, the college has become a Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) school, which is a historic change to the college as it freed the school from the centralised funding system that currently administers secondary education in Hong Kong. Students enrolled in the 2002 Primary 1 class at St Stephen&#x27;s College Preparatory School, also based in Stanley, were the first group of students to enter the DSS system. In order to upgrade the school administrative level, this is the first secondary school in Hong Kong to employ a registered professional housing manager on its staff to manage and handle all property and facilities-related issues for and on behalf of the school.

==Houses==
St Stephen&#x27;s College has a house system and divides its students into six houses with six different colors. Some names of the houses came from the names of the first few principals of the college:

*Barnett House (Orange) - The Ven. E. J. Barnett;
*Stewart House (Purple) - The Revd. A. D. Stewart;
*Hewitt House (Red) - The Revd. W. H. Hewitt;
*Martin House (Blue/White) - Canon E. W. L. Martin;
*Priestley House (Green) - Mr. C. T. Priestley;
*College House (Yellow)

==Curriculum==
Before the 2009–2010 academic year, as a local school in Hong Kong, the college had been providing three years of junior secondary, two years of senior secondary and two years of matriculation education under the English 3223 education system.

After the educational system reform was launched by the government, the college has started providing three years of senior secondary education from Form 4 since the 2009–2010 academic year under the New Senior Secondary 334 Scheme.
Meanwhile, the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) had also commenced in the academic year of 2014–2015. The IBDP is a two-year curriculum and is monitored under the International Baccalaureate Organization rather than the Education Bureau of Hong Kong. Since IBDP is two years long, the college will provide a one-year IBDP bridging course to help student adapt to the essay and discussion emphasized IBDP education mode.

<text>HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; (pennant number: 28) was the name ship of her class of two battleships built for the Royal Navy in the 1920s. They were the first battleships built to meet the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Entering service in 1927, the ship spent her peacetime career with the Atlantic and Home Fleets, usually as the fleet flagship. During the early stages of World War II, she searched for German commerce raiders, missed participating in the Norwegian Campaign after she was badly damaged by a mine in late 1939, and escorted convoys in the Atlantic Ocean.

In mid-1941 &quot;Nelson&quot; escorted several convoys to Malta before being torpedoed in September. After repairs she resumed doing so before supporting the British invasion of French Algeria during Operation Torch in late 1942. The ship covered the invasions of Sicily (Operation Husky) and Italy (Operation Avalanche) in mid-1943 while bombarding coastal defences during Operation Baytown. During the Normandy landings in June 1944, &quot;Nelson&quot; provided naval gunfire support before she struck a mine and spent the rest of the year under repair. The ship was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in mid-1945 and returned home a few months after the Japanese surrender in September to serve as the flagship of the Home Fleet. She became a training ship in early 1946 and was reduced to reserve in late 1947. &quot;Nelson&quot; was scrapped two years later after being used as a target for bomb tests.

==Background and description==

The &quot;Nelson&quot;-class battleship was essentially a smaller, battleship version of the G3 battlecruiser which had been cancelled for exceeding the constraints of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. The design, which had been approved six months after the treaty was signed, had a main armament of guns to match the firepower of the American and Japanese es in the battleline in a ship displacing no more than .

&quot;Nelson&quot; had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at mean standard load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. Her crew numbered 1,361 officers and ratings when serving as a flagship and 1,314 as a private ship. The ship was powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam from eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of 23 knots. During her sea trials on 26 May 1927, &quot;Nelson&quot; reached a top speed of from . The ship carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and fire control===

The main battery of the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships consisted of nine breech-loading (BL) 16-inch guns in three turrets forward of the superstructure. Designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; from front to rear, &#x27;B&#x27; turret superfired over the others. Their secondary armament consisted of a dozen BL Mk XXII guns in twin-gun turrets aft of the superstructure, three turrets on each broadside. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of six quick-firing (QF) Mk VIII guns in unshielded single mounts and eight QF 2-pounder () guns in single mounts. The ships were fitted with two submerged 24.5-inch (622 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside, angled 10° off the centreline.
The &quot;Nelson&quot;s were built with two director-control towers fitted with rangefinders to control the main guns. One was mounted above the bridge and the other was at the aft end of the superstructure. Each turret was also fitted with a rangefinder. A back-up director for the main armament was positioned on the roof of the conning tower in an armoured hood. The secondary armament was controlled by four directors equipped with rangefinders. One pair were mounted on each side of the main director on the bridge roof and the others were abreast the aft main director. The anti-aircraft directors were situated on a tower abaft the main-armament director with a 12-foot high-angle rangefinder in the middle of the tower. A pair of torpedo-control directors with 15-foot rangefinders were positioned abreast the funnel.

===Protection===
The ships&#x27; waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between the main gun barbettes and thinned to over the engine and boiler rooms as well as the six-inch magazines, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. To improve its ability to deflect plunging fire, its upper edge was inclined 18° outward. The ends of the armoured citadel were closed off by transverse bulkheads of non-cemented armour thick at the forward end and thick at the aft end. The faces of the main-gun turrets were protected by 16-inch of KC armour while the turret sides were thick and the roof armour plates measured in thickness. The KC armour of the barbettes ranged in thickness from .
The top of the armoured citadel of the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships was protected by an armoured deck that rested on the top of the belt armour. Its non-cemented armour plates ranged in thickness from over the main-gun magazines to over the propulsion machinery spaces and the secondary magazines. Aft of the citadel was an armoured deck thick at the level of the lower edge of the belt armour that extended almost to the end of the stern to cover the steering gear. The conning tower&#x27;s KC armour was thick with a roof. The secondary-gun turrets were protected by of non-cemented armour.

Underwater protection for the &quot;Nelson&quot;s was provided by a double bottom deep and a torpedo protection system. It consisted of an empty outer watertight compartment and an inner water-filled compartment. They had a total depth of and were backed by a torpedo bulkhead 1.5 inches thick.

===Modifications===
The high-angle directors and rangefinder and their platform were replaced by a new circular platform for the High Angle Control System (HACS) Mk I director in May–June 1930. By March 1934, the single two-pounder guns and the starboard torpedo director were removed and replaced by a single octuple two-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount on the starboard side of the funnel. It was provided with a Mk I director mounted on the bridge roof. In 1934–1935, &quot;Nelson&quot; was fitted with a pair of quadruple mounts for Vickers anti-aircraft machine guns that were positioned on the forward superstructure. The ship was also fitted with a crane to handle a Supermarine Seagull biplane amphibian aircraft carried for test purposes; the crane was retained after the end of the trials. Sometime in 1936–1937, she received her portside &quot;pom-pom&quot; and its director. In addition gun shields were fitted to the 4.7-inch guns although they were removed by March 1938. During her refit from June 1937 to January 1938, &quot;Nelson&quot; had her high-angle director tower reinforced and enlarged to accommodate a pair of HACS Mk III directors and new non-cemented deck armour was installed. Like the aft deck armour, it was at the level of the bottom of the armour belt, and extended forward from the front of the citadel almost to the bow; ranging in thickness from close to the citadel to near the bow.

While under repair from January–August 1940 after being mined in December 1939, &quot;Nelson&quot; had her aft 6-inch directors replaced by a pair of octuple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts and another was added on the quarterdeck. She was also fitted with a Type 279 early-warning radar. Gun shields were reinstalled on the 4.7-inch guns and a pair of four 20-tube UP rocket launchers were mounted on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; turrets. These changes increased the size of her crew to 1,452.

During her repairs after being torpedoed in October 1941, &quot;Nelson&quot; had her torpedo tubes and UP rocket launchers removed and an octuple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount was installed on the roof of &#x27;B&#x27; turret. A pair of Oerlikon AA guns were installed on the roof of &#x27;C&#x27; turret and eleven more were mounted in various places on the superstructure; all of which were in single mounts. The existing &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors were replaced by Mk III models and three additional directors were fitted. Each of these directors was equipped with a Type 282 gunnery radar. The HACS directors received Type 285 gunnery radars while the forward main-armament director was fitted with a Type 284 gunnery radar. The ship was also equipped with a Type 273 surface-search radar and four Type 283 radars for using the 16- and 6-inch guns in barrage (anti-aircraft) fire. Another Oerlikon gun was added to the roof of &#x27;C&#x27; turret during a refit in September–October 1942. The 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns were removed and 26 single Oerlikon guns were added in May–June 1943; five of which were on the roof of &#x27;C&#x27; turret and the other were mounted on the deck and the superstructure.

While refitting in the United States in late 1944 to prepare her for operations in the Pacific Ocean, her anti-aircraft armament was augmented with 21 more Oerlikon guns for a total of 61 weapons. The back-up director and its armoured hood were replaced by a new platform for a pair of quadruple mounts for 40 mm Bofors AA guns; another pair of quadruple mounts were added abaft the funnel. Most of the &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors were replaced by four Mk 51 directors for the Bofors guns. These additions increased the ship&#x27;s deep displacement to and her crew to 1,631–1,650 men.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Nelson&quot;, named after Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, was the third ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. She was laid down on 28 December 1922 as part of the 1922 Naval Programme at Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s Low Walker shipyard in North Tyneside, Newcastle upon Tyne and was launched on 3 September 1925. After completing her preliminary sea trials, she was commissioned on 15 August 1927 at a cost of £7,504,055. The &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships received several nicknames: &quot;Nelsol&quot; and &quot;Rodnol&quot; after the Royal Fleet Auxiliary oil tankers with a prominent amidships superstructure and names ending in &quot;ol&quot;, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Mansions&quot; after a resemblance between her superstructure and the Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions block of flats, the &quot;pair of boots&quot;, the &quot;ugly sisters&quot; and the &quot;Cherry Tree class&quot; as they were cut down by the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Nelson&quot;″s trials resumed after she was formally commissioned and continued in October; the ship entered service on 21 October as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet (renamed as Home Fleet in March 1932) and remained so, aside from refits or repairs, until 1 April 1941. Prince George, the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary, served aboard her as a lieutenant on the Admiral&#x27;s staff until his transfer to the light cruiser in 1928. In April 1928, the ship hosted King Amanullah of Afghanistan during exercises off Portland.

On 29 March 1931, she collided with the steamship , of Cardiff, Wales, in foggy conditions off Cape Gilano, Spain, although neither vessel was badly damaged. &quot;Nelson&quot;″s damage was repaired in July. In mid-September, the crew of &quot;Nelson&quot; took part in the Invergordon Mutiny when they refused orders to go to sea for an exercise, although they relented after several days when the Admiralty reduced the severity of the pay cuts that prompted the mutiny. On 12 January 1934, she ran aground on Hamilton&#x27;s Shoal, just off Southsea, as she was about to depart with the Home Fleet for the spring cruise in the West Indies. After removing some supplies and equipment, the ship floated off during the next high tide, undamaged. The subsequent investigation did not find any of the ship&#x27;s officers at fault, attributing the incident to her poor handling at low speed. &quot;Nelson&quot; participated in King George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Fleet Review in Spithead on 16 July 1935 and then King George VI&#x27;s Coronation Fleet Review on 20 May 1937. After a lengthy refit later that year, the ship visited Lisbon, Portugal, together with her sister in February 1938.

===Second World War===
When Great Britain declared war on Germany, on 3 September 1939, &quot;Nelson&quot; and the bulk of the Home Fleet were unsuccessfully patrolling the waters between Iceland, Norway and Scotland for German blockade runners and then did much the same off the Norwegian coast from 6–10 September. On 25–26 September, she helped to cover the salvage and rescue operations of the damaged submarine . A month later, the ship covered an iron ore convoy from Narvik, Norway. On 30 October, &quot;Nelson&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by the near the Orkney Islands and was hit by two of the three torpedoes fired at a range of , none of which exploded. After the sinking of the armed merchant cruiser off the coast of Iceland on 23 November by the German battleships and , &quot;Nelson&quot; and her sister participated in the futile pursuit of them. On 4 December 1939, she detonated a magnetic mine (laid by ) at the entrance to Loch Ewe on the Scottish coast and was under repair in HM Dockyard, Portsmouth, until August 1940. The mine blew a hole in the hull forward of &#x27;A&#x27; turret which flooded the torpedo compartment and some adjacent compartments. The flooding caused a small list and caused the ship to trim down by the bow. No one was killed, but 74 sailors were wounded.
After returning to service in August, &quot;Nelson&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and the battlecruiser were transferred from Scapa Flow to Rosyth, Scotland, in case of invasion. When the signal from the armed merchant cruiser that she was being attacked by the German heavy cruiser on 5 November was received by the Admiralty, &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; were deployed to block the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, although &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; headed for the South Atlantic afterwards. When the Admiralty learned that &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to resume commerce raiding operations, &quot;Nelson&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and the battlecruiser were ordered on 25 January 1941 to assume a position south of Iceland where they could intercept them. After spotting a pair of British cruisers on 28 January, the German ships turned away and were not pursued.

&quot;Nelson&quot; became a private ship on 1 April and she was detached to escort Convoy WS.7 from the UK to South Africa, visiting Freetown, Sierra Leone, on the 4th. On the return voyage, she and the aircraft carrier passed the at a range of during the night of 18 May in the South Atlantic without spotting the German ship. After the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May, the was spotted two days later heading for France and &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; were ordered to join the pursuit from their position north of Freetown. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk the following day well before &quot;Nelson&quot; and her consort could reach her. On 1 June, the battleship was assigned to escort Convoy SL.75 to the UK. After the German supply ship &quot;Gonzenheim&quot; was able to evade the armed merchant cruiser on 4 June, &quot;Nelson&quot; was detached to intercept the German ship, which was scuttled by her crew when they spotted &quot;Nelson&quot; approaching later that day. After arriving in the UK, the ship rejoined the Home Fleet.

====Mediterranean service====

On 11 July, the ship was assigned to escort Convoy WS.9C that consisted of merchantmen that were to pass into the Mediterranean to deliver troops and supplies to Malta. Once they passed Gibraltar, the escorts were designated as Force X and they were to be reinforced by Force H while in the Western Mediterranean. The ships entered the Mediterranean on the night of 20/21 July and they were attacked by Italian aircraft beginning on the morning of the 23rd. &quot;Nelson&quot; was not engaged and joined Force H later that day as the merchantmen and their escort continued onwards to Malta. The cruisers from Force X rejoined them two days later and the combined force arrived back in Gibraltar on 27 July. On 31 July–4 August, Force H provided distant cover to another convoy to Malta (Operation Style). Vice-Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, transferred his flag to &quot;Nelson&quot; on 8 August. Several weeks later, the ship participated in Operation Mincemeat, during which Force H escorted a minelayer to Livorno to lay its mines while ″s aircraft attacked Northern Sardinia as a diversion. On 13 September, Force H escorted &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the aircraft carrier into the Western Mediterranean as they flew off 45 Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta.

As part of a deception operation when Operation Halberd, another mission to convey troops and supplies to Malta, began on 24 September, Somerville&#x27;s flag was transferred to &quot;Rodney&quot; while &quot;Nelson&quot; and some escorting destroyers departed Gibraltar heading westwards as if the former ship had relieved the latter. &quot;Rodney&quot; and the rest of Force H headed eastwards with &quot;Nelson&quot; and her escorts joining the main body during the night. The British were spotted the following morning and attacked by (Royal Italian Air Force) aircraft the next day. A Savoia-Marchetti SM.84 torpedo bomber penetrated the screen and dropped a torpedo at a range of . It blew a hole in the bow, wrecked the torpedo compartment and caused extensive flooding; there were no casualties amongst the crew. Although she was down at the bow by and ultimately limited to a speed of to reduce the pressure on her bulkheads, &quot;Nelson&quot; remained with the fleet to so that the Italians would not know that she had been damaged. After emergency repairs were made in Gibraltar, the ship proceeded to Rosyth where she was under repair until May 1942.

&quot;Nelson&quot; was assigned to the Eastern Fleet after she finished working up and departed 31 May, escorting Convoy WS.19P from the Clyde to Freetown and its continuation WS.19PF to Durban, South Africa, en route. She was recalled on 26 June to participate in Operation Pedestal, a major effort to resupply Malta. Reaching Scapa Flow exactly a month later, she became the flagship of Vice-Admiral Edward Syfret, commander of the operation, the following day. The convoy departed the Clyde on 3 August and conducted training before passing through the Strait of Gibraltar on the night of 9/10 August. The convoy was spotted later that morning and the Axis attacks began the following day with the sinking of &quot;Eagle&quot; by a German submarine. Despite repeated attacks by Axis aircraft and submarines, &quot;Nelson&quot; was not damaged and made no claims to have shot down any aircraft before the convoy&#x27;s capital ships turned back before reaching the Skerki Banks between Sicily and Tunisia late in the day on the 12th. The ship returned to Scapa Flow afterwards.
She was transferred to Force H in October to support Operation Torch, departing on the 30th and she arrived in Gibraltar on 6 November. Two days later, Force H provided cover against any interference by the for the invading forces in the Mediterranean as they began their landings. Syfret, now commander of Force H, hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Nelson&quot; on 15 November. Force H covered a troop convoy from Gibraltar to Algiers, French Algeria, in January 1943. Syfret temporarily transferred his flag to the battleship in May as &quot;Nelson&quot; returned to Scapa Flow to train for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The ship departed Scapa on 17 June and arrived at Gibraltar on the 23rd.

====1943–1949====
On 9 July, Force H, with &quot;Nelson&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; and the carrier , rendezvoused in the Gulf of Sirte with the battleships , and the carrier coming from Alexandria, Egypt to form the covering force for the invasion. The following day, they began patrolling in the Ionian Sea to deter any attempt by the to interfere with the landings in Sicily. On 31 August, &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; bombarded coastal artillery positions between Reggio Calabria and Pessaro in preparation for Operation Baytown, the amphibious invasion of Calabria, Italy. The sisters covered the amphibious landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September with &quot;Nelson&quot; using her main guns in &quot;barrage&quot; mode to deter attacking German torpedo bombers. The Italian surrender was signed between General Dwight Eisenhower and Marshal Pietro Badoglio aboard the ship on 29 September.
&quot;Nelson&quot; departed Gibraltar on 31 October for England to rejoin the Home Fleet. She provided naval gunfire support during the Normandy landings in June 1944, but was badly damaged after hitting two mines on the 18th. Temporarily repaired in Portsmouth, the ship was sent to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in the United States on 22 June for repairs. She returned to Britain in January 1945 and was then assigned to the Eastern Fleet, arriving in Colombo, Ceylon, on 9 July. The ship became the fleet flagship three days later. &quot;Nelson&quot; was used on the western coast of the Malayan Peninsula for three months, taking part in Operation Livery. The Japanese forces there formally surrendered aboard her at George Town, Penang, on 2 September 1945. Ten days later, the ship was present when the Japanese forces in all of South-east Asia surrendered in Singapore.

&quot;Nelson&quot; was relieved as flagship on 20 September and departed for home on 13 October. She arrived at Portsmouth on 17 November and became the flagship of the Home Fleet a week later. &quot;King George V&quot; replaced her as flagship on 9 April 1946 and &quot;Nelson&quot; became a training ship in July. When the Training Squadron was formed on 14 August, the ship became flagship of the Rear-Admiral that commanded the training battleships. She was relieved as flagship by the battleship in October and became a private ship. &quot;Nelson&quot; was slightly damaged by a collision with the submarine in Portland on 15 April 1947. The ship was placed in reserve on 20 October 1947 at Rosyth and was listed for disposal on 19 May 1948. From 4 June to 23 September, she was used as a target ship for armour-piercing aerial bombs to evaluate their ability to penetrate the ship&#x27;s armoured deck. &quot;Nelson&quot; was turned over to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation on 5 January 1949 and was allocated to Thos. W. Ward for scrapping. The ship arrived at Inverkeithing on 15 March to begin demolition.

<text>Giacomo Leoni (1686 – 8 June 1746), also known as James Leoni, was an Italian architect, born in Venice. He was a devotee of the work of Florentine Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti, who had also been an inspiration for Andrea Palladio. Leoni thus served as a prominent exponent of Palladianism in English architecture, beginning in earnest around 1720. Also loosely referred to as Georgian, this style is rooted in Italian Renaissance architecture.

Having previously worked in Düsseldorf, Leoni arrived in England, where he was to make his name, in 1714, aged 28. His fresh, uncluttered designs, with just a hint of Baroque flamboyance, brought him to the attention of prominent patrons of the arts.

==Early life==
Leoni&#x27;s early life is poorly documented. He is first recorded in Düsseldorf in 1708, and arrived in England sometime before 1715. Between 1715 and 1720 he published in instalments the first complete English language edition of Palladio&#x27;s &quot;I Quattro Libri dell&#x27;Architettura&quot;, which Leoni entitled &quot;The Architecture of A. Palladio, in Four Books&quot;. The translation was a huge success and went into multiple editions in the following years (&quot;illustration, left&quot;) Despite Leoni&#x27;s often eccentric alterations to Palladio&#x27;s illustrations, his edition became a main vehicle for disseminating the essence of Palladio&#x27;s style among British designers. The direct impact of Palladio&#x27;s text was upon building patrons, for these expensive volumes were out of the reach of most builders, who could consult them only briefly in a gentleman&#x27;s library. In 1738 Isaac Ware, with the encouragement of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, produced a more accurate translation of Palladio&#x27;s work with illustrations which were faithful to the originals, but Leoni&#x27;s changes and inaccuracies continued to influence Palladianism for generations.

On the frontispiece of his edition of Palladio, Leoni titled himself &quot;Architect to his most serene Highness the Elector Palatine.&quot; This claim, however, remains unsubstantiated.

Leoni followed his Palladian volume with an English translation of Alberti&#x27;s &quot;De Re Aedificatoria&quot; (&quot;On Architecture&quot;), the first modern book on the theories and practice of architecture.

==Works==
Giacomo Leoni&#x27;s principal architectural skill was to adapt Alberti&#x27;s and Palladio&#x27;s ideals to suit the landed classes in the English countryside, without straying too far from the principles of the great masters. He made Palladian architecture less austere, and adapted his work to suit the location and needs of his clients. The use of red brick as a building component had begun to replace dressed stone during the William and Mary era. Leoni would frequently build in both, depending on availability and what was indigenous to the area of the site.

Leoni&#x27;s first commissions in England, though for high-profile clients Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent and James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, First Lord of the Treasury, remained unexecuted. His first built design in England was Queensberry House, 7 Burlington Gardens, for John Bligh, Lord Clifton, in 1721. This was to be an important architectural landmark, as the first London mansion to be built on a terrace with an &quot;antique temple front.&quot;

Throughout this career in England, Leoni was to be responsible for the design of at least twelve large country houses and at least six London mansions. He is also known to have designed church monuments and memorials.

===Lyme Park===
In the early 1720s, Leoni received one of his most important challenges: to transform a great Elizabethan house, Lyme Hall, into a Palladian palace. This he did so sympathetically that internally, large areas of the house remained completely unaltered, and the wood carvings by Grinling Gibbons were left intact. In the central courtyard Leoni achieved the Palladian style by hiding the irregularities and lack of symmetry of the earlier house in a series of arcades around the courtyard.

The transformation at Lyme was a success. However, it has been claimed that the central Ionic portico, the focal point of the south front, was a little spoiled later by English architect Lewis Wyatt&#x27;s 19th-century addition of a box-like structure above its pediment. This squat tower, known as a &quot;hamper,&quot; is on the site of Leoni&#x27;s intended cupola, which was rejected by the owner.

Leoni reconstructed Lyme in an early form of what was to become known as the Palladian style, with the secondary, domestic and staff rooms on a rusticated ground floor, above which was a piano nobile, formally accessed by an exterior double staircase from the courtyard. Above the piano nobile were the more private room and less formal rooms for the family.

In a true Palladian house (one villa designed by Palladio himself), the central portion behind the portico would contain the principal rooms, while the lower flanking wings were domestic offices usually leading to terminating pavilions which would often be agricultural in use. It was this adaption of the wings and pavilions into the body of the house that was to be a hallmark of the 18th-century Palladianism that spread across Europe, and of which Leoni was an early exponent. At Lyme, while the central portico, resting upon a base reminiscent of Palladio&#x27;s Villa Pisani, dominates the façade, the flanking wings are short, and of the same height as the central block, and the terminating pavilions are merely suggested by a slight projection in the facade. Thus in no way could the portico be seen as a corps de logis. This has led some architectural commentators to describe the south front as more Baroque than Palladian in style. However, at this early stage of his career Leoni appears to have been still following the earlier and more renaissance-inspired Palladianism which had been imported to England in the 17th century by Inigo Jones. This is evident by his use of classical pilasters throughout the south façade, in the same way that Jones had used them, a century earlier, at the Banqueting House, Whitehall and Leoni&#x27;s mentor, Alberti, had employed them at the Palazzo Rucellai in the 1440s. These features, coupled with the heavy mannerist use of rustication on the ground floor with segmented arches and windows, is the reason that Lyme appears more &quot;Italian&quot; than many other English houses in the Palladian style and has led to it being described as &quot;the boldest Palladian building in England.&quot;

===Clandon House===
In 1730 Leoni was commissioned by the Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow to build what is probably his masterpiece, Clandon House, near Guildford in Surrey. The result was a house of &quot;exuberant grandeur and at the same time endearing naivety&quot;. This coupling of grandeur and naivety was to become Leoni&#x27;s own style, as he mixed the Baroque and Palladian styles. Clandon was built of a fiery red brick, with the west front dressed with stone pilasters and medallion ornamentation. The interiors contrasted with the exterior: the huge double-height marble hall is in muted stone colours, to provide a foil for the vibrant colours of the adjoining suite of staterooms. The interiors were altered slightly later in the 18th century, but here the house was fortunate; the changes were made in the style of Robert Adam, so were sympathetic to Leoni&#x27;s original intentions. The marble hall is considered one of the most imposing 18th-century architectural features in England, as are the magnificent plasterwork ceilings. From this point in time the house was largely unaltered, until the 2015 fire. A fire in April 2015 left the house gutted, apart from one room. Much of the architecture, walls, ceilings, floors and historic artefacts that the building housed were destroyed. The house currently remains a shell.

===Moor Park===
Leoni designed Moor Park, Hertfordshire, during the 1720s, assisted by the painter Sir James Thornhill. The commission was received from Bengamin Styles, an entrepreneur later to lose his fortune in the South Sea Bubble. Leoni completely redesigned the house, originally built for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth in 1680, giving it a massive Corinthian portico which leads into a vast hall with a painted and gilded ceiling, with a trompe-l&#x27;œil dome, painted by Thornhill.

The house was to have similarities with one of Leoni&#x27;s more ambitious projects, Lathom House. Both were similar in concept to Andrea Palladio&#x27;s never-built Villa Mocenigo, with great spreading and segmented colonnaded wings embracing a cour d&#x27;honneur. Today, the wings have been demolished but the square corps de logis remains.

Lathom House (demolished in 1929) was a truly Palladian house with a large corps de logis, from which spread twin segmented colonnades linking it to two monumental secondary wings of stables and domestic offices. The secondary wings or blocks, each crowned with a cupola, were similar in style to those built by Henry Flitcroft for the Duke of Bedford twenty years later at the far larger Woburn Abbey.

===Miscellaneous works===

However, Leoni&#x27;s clients were not always satisfied, especially when he designed for clients unaware of the intricacies of Palladian architecture. Leoni had been commissioned by Edward and Caroline Wortley to rebuild the decayed Wortley Hall in South Yorkshire. A magnificent residence arose. However, in 1800, the Wortleys complained they were unable to move in, as the architect had forgotten to build a staircase. One hundred years later, a Duchess of Marlborough made the same complaint against Sir John Vanbrugh&#x27;s Blenheim Palace. Both owners had rather missed the point of a house built on a &#x27;piano nobile&#x27; design. A piano nobile is the principal floor, usually above a lower floor or semi-basement. It contains all the rooms necessary for the grandees who inhabit the house. It usually consists of a central salon or saloon (the grandest room beneath the central pediment); on either side of the saloon (in the wings) there is often a slightly less grand, withdrawing room, and then a principal bedroom. After that perhaps would follow a smaller more intimate room, a &quot;cabinet&quot;. The point both the Duchess and owners of Wortley had failed to grasp was that the owners lived in &#x27;state&#x27; on the &#x27;piano nobile&#x27; and had no need to go upstairs, hence only secondary/back staircases would reach the floors that were occupied by children, servants and less favoured guests. Indeed, these houses often did have a grand staircase, but it was external—the elaborate flights of stone steps to the main entrance on the piano nobile. From photographs of Wortley Hall, one can see the large, tall windows of the &#x27;piano nobile&#x27; on the lower floor, and the much smaller windows of the secondary rooms above. It did not require a &#x27;grand&#x27; staircase&#x27;. Wortley Hall survives today as a hotel; the owners still tell the story of the forgetful architect. Among Leoni’s other designs is Alkrington Hall in Middleton, now in Greater Manchester.

Leoni was not the first to import Palladian architecture to England; that accolade belongs firmly to Inigo Jones, who had designed the Palladian Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich in 1616 and the more ornate Banqueting House in Whitehall in 1619. Nor was he the only architect practising the concept during Palladianism. William Kent designed Holkham Hall in 1734 in the Palladian manner; Thomas Archer was also a contemporary, although his work tended toward the Baroque style that had been popular in England prior to the Palladian revival. Palladian architecture was able to flourish in England though, as it was suited to the great country houses being built or re-modelled; because unlike the French, the British aristocracy placed primary importance on their country estates.

For all his work and fame, Leoni did not achieve great financial benefit. It is recorded that in 1734, Lord Fitzwalter of Moulsham gave him £25 to ease his &quot;being in distress.&quot;. Later, as Leoni lay dying in 1746, Lord Fitzwalter sent him a further £8 &quot;par charité&quot; He is known to have had a wife, Mary, and two sons, one of whom is &quot;thought&quot; to have been a clerk to the great exponent of Palladianism Matthew Brettingham.
Leoni did not only design grand mansions. His lesser designs included an octagonal garden temple at Cliveden for George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney, in 1735; an elegant arch in purest Palladian tradition, at Stowe, for Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham; and a Portland stone bridge at Stone Court, Carshalton. Leoni is thought to have designed a new church when working for Robert Petre, 8th Baron Petre at Thorndon Hall, Essex. The original church had been swept away to make room for the new mansion he was designing there.

Today, it is difficult to assess Leoni&#x27;s works as much has been destroyed. Amongst his country houses, Moulsham, built in 1728, was pulled down in 1816; Bodecton Park, completed in 1738 was razed in 1826 and Lathom, completed circa 1740, was lost like so many other English country houses in the 20th century. By the early 20th century, the style of Palladianism which Leoni&#x27;s books and works did so much to promote, was so quintessentially English that the fact that it was regarded as purely Italian at the time of its inception was largely forgotten. So indigenous to England does it seem, that in 1913 – a time of huge pride in all things British – Sir Aston Webb&#x27;s new principal façade at Buckingham Palace strongly resembled Leoni&#x27;s &#x27;Italian palazzo.&#x27;


==Death and legacy==

Giacomo Leoni died in 1746 and was buried in Old St Pancras Churchyard in London. His name is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial, erected in that churchyard in 1879 by Baroness Burdett Coutts, listing the important graves lost.

By the time of his death, Palladianism had been taken up by a whole new generation of British architects working in the classical forms, and was to remain in fashion until it was replaced by the Neoclassical interpretations of such architects as Robert Adam.

His final intended publication, which would have added to an evaluation of his work &quot;&quot;Treatise of Architecture and ye Art of Building Publick and Private Edifices—Containing Several Noblemen&#x27;s Houses &amp; Country Seats&quot;’ was to have been a book of his own designs and interpretations. It remained uncompleted at the time of his death.

<text>Hot flashes, also known as hot flushes, are a form of flushing, often caused by the changing hormone levels that are characteristic of menopause. They are typically experienced as a feeling of intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat, and may typically last from two to 30 minutes for each occurrence.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Hot flashes, a common symptom of menopause and perimenopause, are typically experienced as a feeling of intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat, and may typically last from two to thirty minutes for each occurrence, ending just as rapidly as they began. The sensation of heat usually begins in the face or chest, although it may appear elsewhere such as the back of the neck, and it can spread throughout the whole body. Some people feel as if they are going to faint. In addition to being an internal sensation, the surface of the skin, especially on the face, becomes hot to the touch. This is the origin of the alternative term &quot;hot flush&quot;, since the sensation of heat is often accompanied by visible reddening of the face.

The hot-flash event may be repeated a few times each week or every few minutes throughout the day. Hot flashes may begin to appear several years before menopause starts and last for years afterwards. Some people undergoing menopause never have hot flashes. Others have mild or infrequent flashes. Those most affected experience dozens of hot flashes each day. In addition, hot flashes are often more frequent and more intense during hot weather or in an overheated room, the surrounding heat apparently making the hot flashes themselves both more likely to occur, and more severe.

Severe hot flashes can make it difficult to get a full night&#x27;s sleep (often characterized as insomnia), which in turn can affect mood, impair concentration, and cause other physical problems. When hot flashes occur at night, they are called &quot;night sweats&quot;. As estrogen is typically lowest at night, some people get night sweats without having any hot flashes during the daytime.

=== Young females ===
If hot flashes occur at other times in a young female&#x27;s menstrual cycle, then it might be a symptom of a problem with the pituitary gland; seeing a doctor is highly recommended. In younger females who are surgically menopausal, hot flashes are generally more intense than in older females, and they may last until natural age at menopause.

=== Males ===
Hot flashes in males could have various causes. It can be a sign of low testosterone. Males with prostate cancer or testicular cancer can also have hot flashes, especially those who are undergoing hormone therapy with antiandrogens, also known as androgen antagonists, which reduce testosterone to castrate levels. Males who are castrated can also get hot flashes.

=== Types ===
Some menopausal females may experience both standard hot flashes and a second type sometimes referred to as &quot;slow hot flashes&quot; or &quot;ember flashes&quot;. The standard hot flash comes on rapidly, sometimes reaching maximum intensity in as little as a minute. It lasts at full intensity for only a few minutes before gradually fading.

Slow &quot;ember&quot; flashes appear almost as quickly but are less intense and last for around half an hour. Females who experience them may undergo them year round, rather than primarily in the summer, and ember flashes may linger for years after the more intense hot flashes have passed.

== Mechanism ==
Research on hot flashes is mostly focused on treatment options. The exact cause and pathogenesis, or causes, of vasomotor symptoms (VMS)—the clinical name for hot flashes—has not yet been fully studied.

Hot flashes are associated with declining levels of estrogen (estrogen withdrawal) and other hormonal changes. It does not appear that low levels of estrogen are the sole cause of hot flashes, as women who experience hot flashes have around the same plasma estrogen levels as women who do not have them, and prepubertal girls do not have hot flashes despite low estrogen levels.

There are indications that hot flashes may be due to a change in the hypothalamus&#x27;s control of temperature regulation.

Transgender men also commonly report experiences of hot flashes. This is linked to hormonal changes possible from many aspects of masculinizing gender-affirming care, including the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists as puberty blockers, reduction of estrogen levels after having undergone oopherectomy, and long term testosterone use reducing production of estradiols.

== Treatment ==

=== Hormone replacement therapy ===
Hormone replacement therapy may relieve many of the symptoms of menopause. However, oral HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and dementia and has other potentially serious short-term and long-term risks. Since the incidence of cardiovascular disease in women has shown a rise that matches the increase in the number of post menopausal women, recent studies have examined the benefits and side effects of oral versus transdermal application of different estrogens and found that transdermal applications of estradiol may give the vascular benefits lowering the incidences of cardiovascular events with fewer adverse side effects than oral preparations.

Women who experience troublesome hot flashes are advised by some to try alternatives to hormonal therapies as the first line of treatment. If a woman chooses hormones, they suggest she take the lowest dose that alleviates her symptoms for as short a time as possible. The US Endocrine Society concluded that women taking hormone replacement therapy for 5 years or more experienced overall benefits in their symptoms including relief of hot flashes and symptoms of urogenital atrophy and prevention of fractures and diabetes.

When estrogen as estradiol is used transdermally as a patch, gel, or pessary with micronized progesterone this may avoid the serious side effects associated with oral estradiol HRT since this avoids first pass metabolism (Phase I drug metabolism). Women taking bioidentical estrogen, orally or transdermally, who have a uterus must still take a progestin or micronized progesterone to lower the risk of endometrial cancer. A French study of 80,391 postmenopausal women followed for several years concluded that estrogen in combination with micronized progesterone is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The natural, plant-derived progesterone creams sold over the counter contain too little progesterone to be effective. Wild yam (&quot;Dioscorea villosa&quot;) extract creams are not effective since the natural progesterone present in the extract is not bioavailable.

=== Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ===
SSRIs are a class of pharmaceuticals that are most commonly used in the treatment of depression. They have been found efficient in alleviating hot flashes. On 28 June 2013 FDA approved Brisdelle (low-dose paroxetine mesylate) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flashes and night sweats) associated with menopause. Paroxetine became the first and only non-hormonal therapy for menopausal hot flashes approved by FDA.

=== Clonidine ===
Clonidine is a blood pressure-lowering medication that can be used to relieve menopausal hot flashes when hormone replacement therapy is not needed or not desired. For hot flashes, clonidine works by helping reduce the response of the blood vessels to stimuli that cause them to narrow and widen. While not all women respond to clonidine as a hot flash medication, it can reduce hot flashes by 40% in some peri-menopausal women.

=== Isoflavones ===
Isoflavones are commonly found in legumes such as soy and red clover. The two soy isoflavones implicated in relieving menopausal symptoms are genistein and daidzein, and are also known as phytoestrogens. The half life of these molecules is about eight hours, which might explain why some studies have not consistently shown effectiveness of soy products for menopausal symptoms. Although red clover (&quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;) contains isoflavones similar to soy, the effectiveness of this herb for menopausal symptoms at relatively low concentrations points to a different mechanism of action.

=== Other phytoestrogens ===
It is believed that dietary changes that include a higher consumption of phytoestrogens from sources such as soy, red clover, ginseng, and yam may relieve hot flashes.
* Ginseng: Very few studies exist on the effect of ginseng for relief of menopausal symptoms. In a large double-blinded randomized controlled trial, reduction in hot flashes was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend towards improvement. Lack of statistical significance suggests future research, but does not meet the scientific bar for ginseng to be deemed effective.
* Flaxseed: There have also been several clinical trials using flaxseed. Flaxseed is the richest source of lignans, which is one of three major classes of phytoestrogen. Lignans are thought to have estrogen agonist and antagonist effects as well as antioxidant properties. Flaxseed and its lignans may have potent anti-estrogenic effects on estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and may have benefits in breast cancer prevention efforts. One recent study done in France, looked at four types of lignans, including that found in flaxseed (Secoisolariciresinol) in a prospective cohort study to see if intake predicted breast cancer incidence. The authors report lowered risk of breast cancer among over 58,000 postmenopausal women who had the third highest quartile of lignan intake. There have been a few small pilot studies that have tested the effect of flaxseed on hot flashes. Currently there is a large study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that is ongoing, but not accepting any new participants. The rationale for the study is that estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause, but can also cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Flaxseed may reduce the number of hot flashes and improve mood and quality of life in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy.

=== Acupuncture ===
Acupuncture has been suggested to reduce incidence of hot flashes in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer, but the quality of evidence is low.

== Epidemiology ==
It has been speculated that hot flashes are less common among Asian women.

Menopausal women who have more hot flashes have a higher risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

<text>Frank Charles Meyers Lane (February 1, 1895 – March 19, 1981) was an American executive in professional baseball, most notably serving as a general manager in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics and Milwaukee Brewers for over fifteen seasons between and .

==Biography==

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Lane&#x27;s first involvement with professional sports came in American football, where he played guard for a number of &quot;Ohio League&quot; teams prior to the creation of the National Football League. After his attempt at playing professional baseball fell short, Lane shifted to officiating, serving as a referee in both football and basketball.

==Baseball front offices==
In 1933 he was named as traveling secretary for the Cincinnati Reds, while continuing to spend his offseasons as an official. After later spending one season as general manager of the team&#x27;s Durham, North Carolina minor league club, Lane was elevated to assistant general manager for the Reds under Warren Giles on November 17, 1936.

After the U.S. entered World War II, Lane joined the Navy and spent the next four years in the service before returning in 1946 as general manager of the Kansas City Blues, a top farm club of the New York Yankees. One year in that position led to a two-year stretch as president of the minor league American Association.

===Chicago White Sox===
Lane then resigned that post in 1948 to become general manager of the White Sox. Over the next seven years, he shaped the team into a contender after more than two decades of mediocrity, acquiring Baseball Hall of Famers Nellie Fox and Minnie Miñoso, and All-Stars Chico Carrasquel, Sherm Lollar and Billy Pierce, among many others. Fox, a future 15-time All-Star and American League MVP, was acquired from the Philadelphia Athletics at age 21, straight-up for backup catcher Joe Tipton; the price of the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Pierce (also 21), a future seven-time AL All-Star who would win 186 games in a White Sox uniform, was another catcher, 33-year-old Aaron Robinson, who had only three major-league seasons left in his tank. In his seven years in Chicago, Lane made 241 trades. The ChiSox made their league&#x27;s first division in 1951, and topped the one-million mark in attendance each year for the remainder of Lane&#x27;s tenure.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
After resigning in September 1955, Lane quickly found work again in St. Louis, signing a three-year contract as general manager of the Cardinals on October 6. His first controversial move was to introduce new home and away uniforms of which the pair of redbirds on a bat was removed in favor of only the name &quot;Cardinals&quot; in red script edged with navy blue. In what he subsequently referred to as &quot;the worst trade [he] ever made,&quot; Lane sent Bill Virdon, recipient of the previous season&#x27;s National League Rookie of the Year Award, to the Pirates for Bobby Del Greco and Dick Littlefield on May 17, 1956. When Lane tried to trade superstar hitter Stan Musial to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Robin Roberts—both future Hall of Famers—news of the proposed transaction was leaked to the radio and Cardinals&#x27; owner August A. Busch Jr. stopped the deal.

===Cleveland Indians===
The Cardinals finished second in their league in , eight games out, but Lane moved on to Cleveland in November to take the reins of the Indians&#x27; front office. There he gained infamy in April 1960 by trading popular star slugger Rocky Colavito, who co-led the Junior Circuit in home runs in 1959, to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn, the defending American League batting champion, whom Lane would trade to the San Francisco Giants on December 3 for John Antonelli and Willie Kirkland; this was the final trade for Lane as GM of the Indians.

===Kansas City Athletics===
Lane left Cleveland in January 1961 to become general manager of the Kansas City Athletics, but the combination of Lane and volatile owner Charlie Finley led to an early end to Lane&#x27;s employment just eight months later, and a lawsuit ensued. Due to his uncertain contract status, Lane was forced out of baseball during this period, but found employment in early 1962 as general manager of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Chicago Packers. He did not join the team when they moved to Baltimore after the 1963 season. The following year, the lawsuit finally went to trial.

On January 8, 1965, Lane settled his lawsuit with Finley, accepting $113,000 plus the freedom to take another baseball front-office position. Early reports of his being part of an ownership group to buy the Boston Red Sox, as well as potentially serving as president of the Texas League, proved to be unfounded. Instead, he was appointed as a special assistant to the president with the Baltimore Orioles two months later on March 6, handling the duties of a scout, field representative and traveling ambassador. He served in that capacity for nearly six years.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
Shortly before his 76th birthday, Lane was hired as director of player personnel with the Milwaukee Brewers on January 23, 1971. He took advantage of the rain postponement of Game 2 of the 1971 World Series on October 10 to acquire George Scott, Jim Lonborg, Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Joe Lahoud and Don Pavletich in a ten-player blockbuster that also sent Tommy Harper, Marty Pattin, Lew Krausse Jr. and minor-league outfielder Pat Skrable to the Red Sox. Lane ended his career as a scout for both the California Angels and Texas Rangers.

==Death and reputation==
Lane gained fame (and sometimes infamy) for his many transactions, earning nicknames such as &quot;Trader Frank&quot;, &quot;Frantic Frank&quot;, &quot;Trader Lane&quot; and &quot;The Wheeler Dealer&quot; for having made over 400 trades in his career, including 241 with the White Sox alone. Lane traded star players, such as Norm Cash, Rocky Colavito and Roger Maris, as well as future Hall of Famers Red Schoendienst and Early Wynn.

Yet players were not the only people involved in Lane&#x27;s transactions – in 1960, during his tenure with the Indians, he dealt manager Joe Gordon in exchange for Detroit Tigers skipper Jimmy Dykes.
He died in a Dallas, Texas nursing home at 86 years of age. In Bobby Bragan&#x27;s book &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hit the Ball With the Bat On Your Shoulder&quot;, Bragan wrote that he was asked by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn&#x27;s office to represent Major League Baseball at the funeral. He was the lone baseball official to attend.

<doc id="691245" wikidata="Q599613" url="?curid=691245" title="County of Namur">
<text>Namur () was a county of the Carolingian and later Holy Roman Empire in the Low Countries, a region in northwestern Europe. Its territories largely correspond with the present-day French-speaking Belgian arrondissement Namur together with the northwestern part of the arrondissement Dinant, which are both part of the modern province of Namur. The modern provincial boundaries are based on the French Republican department of Sambre-et-Meuse.

== Prehistory to the Roman period ==
The city of Namur most likely arose around &#x27;the Champeau&#x27;, a rocky hill between the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Numerous prehistoric flint weapons have been found in the area. During Roman times, the region around Namur was first mentioned in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in the second half of the 1st century BC. To the west of Namur were the Nervii, and to the east the Germani cisrhenani, but it has been suggested that Namur itself may have been home to the Aduatuci who Caesar described as descendants of the Cimbri and Teutons. (Today it is considered more likely to have been at .) In Caesar&#x27;s wars, the Roman legions conquered numerous Belgic cities and settlements. After this defeat, the Belgae and their territory were incorporated into the Roman Empire.

== The Medieval period ==
The first mention of a region ruled by Namur () treated it as a part of the older Lommegau (&#x27; or &#x27;) in the year 832 in a document by Emperor Louis the Pious. In 992, Emperor Otto III described Albert I as a count of Namur for the first time.

The first count of note was Albert III (1063–1102), who held the office of advocate of the Princely Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy. Until the start of the 12th century, Namur was threatened by its powerful neighbours Brabant, Hainaut and Liège. Important parts of the county were annexed. The city of Dinant, for example, came into possession of Liège. From the 12th century on, the counts of Namur managed to more or less compensate for the losses they had suffered. Count Godfrey, for example, acquired the county of Longwy, thanks to his marriage with Ermesinde of Luxembourg. The last important figure from the first house that ruled Namur was Henry I (1139–96). Henry I also inherited the counties of , La Roche-en-Ardenne and Luxembourg. After Henry&#x27;s death, a fierce succession war broke out between Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, and Henry&#x27;s daughter Ermesinde. Baldwin V eventually received the county of Namur, while Ermesine received Luxembourg, Laroche and Durbuy. The situation remained more or less stable until 1263. In this year, the count of Namur, Baldwin II of Courtenay, sold his county to the count of Flanders, Guy of Dampierre. The house of Dampierre would rule until 1421, when the county of Namur was sold to the Burgundian duke Philip the Good.

== The Burgundian and Habsburg periods ==
After the county of Namur was bought by Philip the Good, he integrated it into a large territorial and political union, called the Burgundian Netherlands. From the 15th century on, the Southern Netherlands (and with it the county of Namur) were ruled by the Habsburgs. Under their new rule, the military importance of the city of Namur steadily grew. The Burgundians and Habsburgs strengthened the city and built new walls around it. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the city became an important military stronghold, and was repeatedly besieged for this reason.

== The Spanish period ==
During the Spanish period (16th and 17th century), Namur received a bishopric&#x27;s seat. The Spanish king Philip II wanted to turn Namur into a Roman Catholic bastion as a bulwark against the rise of Calvinism. Thus, Philip II required several religious orders to establish themselves in Namur. In consequence, the city gained a specific Catholic character. Philip II also managed to make considerable reinforcements to the Citadel of Namur. In 1577, Philip II sent Don Juan of Austria to the Netherlands as the new governor. In Namur, Don Juan received Margaret of Valois (the sister of the French king), and organised a magnificent celebration in her honor.

== Troubled times and changing rulers ==
Namur has had a crucial military role throughout history. After the Spanish period, the strategically important city was repeatedly besieged. In 1692, the troops of Louis XIV of France took the city after a lengthy and furious siege. Louis and his legendary military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban personally oversaw the siege. Three years later, in 1695, William III of Orange retook Namur. But the Dutch occupation did not last long. At the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, the Southern Netherlands came under the rule of the Austrian house of Habsburg. Though the Austrians ruled over the city, the strategically important citadel remained in the hands of the Dutch. The Austrian rule returned peace and calm to the Netherlands.

== The French revolutionists and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands ==
In 1790 the county of Namur was one of the founders of the United States of Belgium. In 1794 the revolutionary France occupied Namur, immediately introducing a repressive regime. Namur became part of the French department of Sambre-et-Meuse. The French occupation was abruptly ended following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. In the Congress of Vienna that followed, the southern and Northern Netherlands were combined to form the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In this period, the citadel was again rebuilt and more or less received its present-day looks. The kingdom of the Netherlands would not last long. In 1830 the Belgian Revolution broke out, in which Belgium became independent from the Netherlands. The strategically important bastion of Namur played a decisive role in the battles associated with the Belgian Revolution.

== Economic activities ==
The economic activities of the County of Namur were diverse. Next to the cultivation of grapes in the river valleys, the agriculture also cultivated flax, that formed the basis of the wool industry. Clay formed the raw materials for the ceramic-production and for the making of molds for the so-called dinanderie, the overall name for the yellow copper brass art objects such as lecterns, candleholders, tableware and others. The metal industry was also important: in the 16th century the mouth of the Meuse (Dinant, Bouvignes, Namur, but also and Liège) was the central region for metallurgy in the Southern Netherlands. Along the banks of the Meuse, limestone was mined and exported.

After years in theatre stock companies, including an 87-week stint in Lincoln, Nebraska, she got a part on Broadway in &quot;Up Pops the Devil&quot; (1930). She received glowing critical reviews for &quot;Blessed Event&quot; (1932) as well.

Jewell&#x27;s film debut came in &quot;Blessed Event&quot; (1932). She had been brought to Hollywood by Warner Brothers for the film version of &quot;Up Pops the Devil&quot;. Jewell gained other supporting roles, appearing in a variety of films in the early 1930s. She played stereotypical gangsters&#x27; women in such films as &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; (1934) and &quot;Marked Woman&quot; (1937). She was well-received playing against type as the seamstress sentenced to death on the guillotine with Sydney Carton (Ronald Colman in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935). Her most significant role was Sally Bates in &quot;She Had to Choose&quot;. Jewell&#x27;s films included &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) (in the role of &quot;that white trash, Emmy Slattery&quot;), &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940), &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), and the low-budget &quot;The Leopard Man&quot; (1943).

By the end of the 1940s, her roles had reduced in significance to the degree that her performances often were uncredited, e.g. &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;. She performed in radio dramas in the 1950s, including &quot;This Is Your FBI&quot;.

In February 1965, she played Madame Ahr, a member of a bank-robbing circus troupe, in an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; entitled &quot;Circus Trick.&quot;

In 1972, Jewell appeared opposite Edie Sedgwick in the film &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot;. Her final film was the B movie &quot;Sweet Kill&quot; (1973), the directorial debut of Curtis Hanson.

== Personal life ==
Jewell was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election. She was also a practicing Episcopalian.

Jewell&#x27;s first marriage (which &quot;was not generally known during Jewell&#x27;s lifetime...[nor] mentioned in the press during her heyday in American films&quot;) occurred when she wed Lovell &quot;Cowboy&quot; Underwood when she was 19. In the mid to late 1930s, Jewell was seen at nightclubs with actor William Hopper. In 1936, she was engaged to actor Owen Crump, marrying in 1939 and divorcing in 1941. In 1941, Jewell married actor Paul Marion, who was then a private in the United States Army. They separated in 1943, and were divorced on May 12, 1944.

==Death and legacy==
Jewell died in Los Angeles, California on April 5, 1972, aged 64, from suicide after taking an overdose of barbiturates. Her ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

In 1960, Jewell was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures. The star is located at 1560 Vine Street.

<text>Quantity or amount is a property that can exist as a multitude or magnitude, which illustrate discontinuity and continuity. Quantities can be compared in terms of &quot;more&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, or &quot;equal&quot;, or by assigning a numerical value multiple of a unit of measurement. Mass, time, distance, heat, and angle are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.

Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others function as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.

Under the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: &quot;army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd&quot;, and &quot;number&quot;; all which are cases of collective nouns. Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: &quot;matter, mass, energy, liquid, material&quot;—all cases of non-collective nouns.

Along with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.

==Background==
In mathematics, the concept of quantity is an ancient one extending back to the time of Aristotle and earlier. Aristotle regarded quantity as a fundamental ontological and scientific category. In Aristotle&#x27;s ontology, quantity or quantum was classified into two different types, which he characterized as follows:

In his &quot;Elements&quot;, Euclid developed the theory of ratios of magnitudes without studying the nature of magnitudes, as Archimedes, but giving the following significant definitions:

For Aristotle and Euclid, relations were conceived as whole numbers (Michell, 1993). John Wallis later conceived of ratios of magnitudes as real numbers:

That is, the ratio of magnitudes of any quantity, whether volume, mass, heat and so on, is a number. Following this, Newton then defined number, and the relationship between quantity and number, in the following terms:

==Structure==
Continuous quantities possess a particular structure that was first explicitly characterized by Hölder (1901) as a set of axioms that define such features as &quot;identities&quot; and &quot;relations&quot; between magnitudes. In science, quantitative structure is the subject of empirical investigation and cannot be assumed to exist &quot;a priori&quot; for any given property. The linear continuum represents the prototype of continuous quantitative structure as characterized by Hölder (1901) (translated in Michell &amp; Ernst, 1996). A fundamental feature of any type of quantity is that the relationships of equality or inequality can in principle be stated in comparisons between particular magnitudes, unlike quality, which is marked by likeness, similarity and difference, diversity. Another fundamental feature is additivity. Additivity may involve concatenation, such as adding two lengths A and B to obtain a third A + B. Additivity is not, however, restricted to extensive quantities but may also entail relations between magnitudes that can be established through experiments that permit tests of hypothesized observable manifestations of the additive relations of magnitudes. Another feature is continuity, on which Michell (1999, p. 51) says of length, as a type of quantitative attribute, &quot;what continuity means is that if any arbitrary length, a, is selected as a unit, then for every positive real number, &quot;r&quot;, there is a length b such that b = &quot;r&quot;a&quot;. A further generalization is given by the theory of conjoint measurement, independently developed by French economist Gérard Debreu (1960) and by the American mathematical psychologist R. Duncan Luce and statistician John Tukey (1964).

==In mathematics==

Magnitude (how much) and multitude (how many), the two principal types of quantities, are further divided as mathematical and physical. In formal terms, quantities—their ratios, proportions, order and formal relationships of equality and inequality—are studied by mathematics. The essential part of mathematical quantities consists of having a collection of variables, each assuming a set of values. These can be a set of a single quantity, referred to as a scalar when represented by real numbers, or have multiple quantities as do vectors and tensors, two kinds of geometric objects.

The mathematical usage of a quantity can then be varied and so is situationally dependent. Quantities can be used as being infinitesimal, arguments of a function, variables in an expression (independent or dependent), or probabilistic as in random and stochastic quantities. In mathematics, magnitudes and multitudes are also not only two distinct kinds of quantity but furthermore relatable to each other.

Number theory covers the topics of the discrete quantities as numbers: number systems with their kinds and relations. Geometry studies the issues of spatial magnitudes: straight lines, curved lines, surfaces and solids, all with their respective measurements and relationships.

A traditional Aristotelian realist philosophy of mathematics, stemming from Aristotle and remaining popular until the eighteenth century, held that mathematics is the &quot;science of quantity&quot;. Quantity was considered to be divided into the discrete (studied by arithmetic) and the continuous (studied by geometry and later calculus). The theory fits reasonably well elementary or school mathematics but less well the abstract topological and algebraic structures of modern mathematics.

==In science==
Establishing quantitative structure and relationships &quot;between&quot; different quantities is the cornerstone of modern science, especially but not restricted to physical sciences. Physics is fundamentally a quantitative science; chemistry, biology and others are increasingly so. Their progress is chiefly achieved due to rendering the abstract qualities of material entities into physical quantities, by postulating that all material bodies marked by quantitative properties or physical dimensions are subject to some measurements and observations. Setting the units of measurement, physics covers such fundamental quantities as space (length, breadth, and depth) and time, mass and force, temperature, energy, and quanta.

A distinction has also been made between intensive quantity and extensive quantity as two types of quantitative property, state or relation. The magnitude of an &quot;intensive quantity&quot; does not depend on the size, or extent, of the object or system of which the quantity is a property, whereas magnitudes of an &quot;extensive quantity&quot; are additive for parts of an entity or subsystems. Thus, magnitude does depend on the extent of the entity or system in the case of extensive quantity. Examples of intensive quantities are density and pressure, while examples of extensive quantities are energy, volume, and mass.

==In natural language==

In human languages, including English, number is a syntactic category, along with person and gender. The quantity is expressed by identifiers, definite and indefinite, and quantifiers, definite and indefinite, as well as by three types of nouns: 1. count unit nouns or countables; 2. mass nouns, uncountables, referring to the indefinite, unidentified amounts; 3. nouns of multitude (collective nouns). The word ‘number’ belongs to a noun of multitude standing either for a single entity or for the individuals making the whole. An amount in general is expressed by a special class of words called identifiers, indefinite and definite and quantifiers, definite and indefinite. The amount may be expressed by: singular form and plural from, ordinal numbers before a count noun singular (first, second, third...), the demonstratives; definite and indefinite numbers and measurements (hundred/hundreds, million/millions), or cardinal numbers before count nouns. The set of language quantifiers covers &quot;a few, a great number, many, several (for count names); a bit of, a little, less, a great deal (amount) of, much (for mass names); all, plenty of, a lot of, enough, more, most, some, any, both, each, either, neither, every, no&quot;. For the complex case of unidentified amounts, the parts and examples of a mass are indicated with respect to the following: a measure of a mass (two kilos of rice and twenty bottles of milk or ten pieces of paper); a piece or part of a mass (part, element, atom, item, article, drop); or a shape of a container (a basket, box, case, cup, bottle, vessel, jar).

==Further examples==
Some further examples of quantities are:

* 1.76 litres (liters) of milk, a continuous quantity
* 2&quot;πr&quot; metres, where &quot;r&quot; is the length of a radius of a circle expressed in metres (or meters), also a continuous quantity
* one apple, two apples, three apples, where the number is an integer representing the count of a denumerable collection of objects (apples)
* 500 people (also a type of count data)
* a &quot;couple&quot; conventionally refers to two objects.
* &quot;a few&quot; usually refers to an indefinite, but usually small number, greater than one.
* &quot;quite a few&quot; also refers to an indefinite, but surprisingly (in relation to the context) large number.
* &quot;several&quot; refers to an indefinite, but usually small, number – usually indefinitely greater than &quot;a few&quot;.

<doc id="691279" wikidata="Q1073027" url="?curid=691279" title="Tantrix">
<text>Tantrix is a hexagonal tile-based abstract game invented by Mike McManaway from New Zealand. Each of the 56 different tiles in the set contains three lines, going from one edge of the tile to another. No two lines on a tile have the same colour. There are four colours in the set: red, yellow, blue, and green. No two tiles are identical, and each is individually numbered from 1 through 56.

==Gameplay==
In the multiplayer version of the game, each player chooses a colour, so there are between two and four players. Each draws one tile from the bag, and the person who draws the highest number goes first.
Each player then takes five more tiles from the bag, and places all six tiles face up in front of them. The first person plays one tile, usually with their colour on it. Play then rotates clockwise. After playing a tile, each player takes a replacement tile from the bag, so that they always have six in front of them. Tiles played must match the colour of the edges adjoining it.

When three tiles surround an empty space so that it is effectively half covered this is called a &quot;forced&quot; space. If the person whose turn it is has a tile that fills that space they must play it. The player repeats this process until there are no more forced spaces that they can fill, at which stage they make a free move, where they can play any tile as long as they don&#x27;t breach the three restriction rules given below. Once they have had a free move, they must then fill any more forced spaces that they can. Thus one player&#x27;s turn can consist of several moves. 

The three restriction rules are:
Once there are no tiles left in the bag, the three restriction rules do not apply.

The aim of the game is to get the longest line or loop in your colour. Each tile in a line counts as one point, and in a loop is two points. Only the highest-scoring line or loop counts.

===Online play===

Although quiet and underpopulated compared to the standards of Yahoo! Games and the like, playing &quot;Tantrix&quot; online has gained a dedicated following with players from all over the world competing against each other or against computer robots. Players are rated out of 1000 points according to their wins and losses and taking into account of their opponents rank. The aim of top players is to get to 1000 points (which only three players have managed so far). The goal of a regular player is to reach the score of 950 which is difficult to reach. Once this score has been attained the player can gain Tournament Rankings (ELO) and eventually earn the title &quot;Master&quot;. Masters can then play &quot;master games&quot; which have a different scoring system. Only a few players achieve master status, with a limit of 120 total imposed.

Serious players of &quot;Tantrix&quot; take part in a number of structured tournaments each year. Although the winners only play for bragging rights, and in the major tournaments a small trophy to keep for a year, these events are taken seriously, and are the ultimate challenge for tantricists.

The WORLD &quot;TANTRIX&quot; CHAMPIONSHIP begins every August, and takes nearly four months to complete. Only 47 competitors took place in the second WTC in 1998, but that number had grown to 200 by 2006. The tournament starts in a qualifying round, where the lower-ranked players compete for selection into the main draw (128-player knockout tournament).

There are three other &quot;world-wide&quot; tournaments held online each year:

:* The World Team Tantrix Championship (WTTC) involving teams of five from one country or region, first in held in 2002
:* The World Junior Tantrix Championship (WJTC) a world championship for players under 16, first held in 2002
:* The World Doubles Tantrix Championship (WDTC) first played in 2005

There are also three continental tournaments each year:

:* The European Championship (Euro) the major dedicated continental tournament, first run in 1999
:* The Pan-American Tantrix Championship (Pan-Am) first held in 1999
:* The Afro-Asian Championship (AsAf) the African Championship was first held in 1999 once, then re-established in 2004, incorporating Asian competitors at the same time

And many national online tournaments:
:* The New Zealand Tantrix Championship first held in 2000
:* The Australian Tantrix Championship first held in 2001
:* The Hungarian Tantrix Championship first held in 2002
:* The Hungarian Masters Tournament first held in 2002
:* The Swedish Tantrix Championship first held in 2003
:* The French Tantrix Championship first held in 2007
:* The Dutch Tantrix Championship first held in 2008
:* The German Tantrix Championship first held in 2008
:* The Spanish Tantrix Championship first held in 2008
:* The Polish Tantrix Championship first held in 2008
:* The Norwegian Tantrix Championship first held in 2009
:* The Czech Tantrix Championship first held in 2010

===Face-to-face play===
In addition to these online tournaments, offline tournaments (referred to as &#x27;Table Opens&#x27;) are growing in popularity. The first Table tournament was the 2002 British Open and was mostly a local affair with 13 of the 14 entrants from Britain. As the player base widened, players started traveling more. Table Opens in Europe soon became the most popular because of the larger playing population. By 2009 there was enough demand to hold a World Tantrix Open.

==History==
The first version of &quot;Tantrix&quot; was created by Mike McManaway in 1988 and was called &quot;Mind Game&quot;. It used 56 cardboard pieces with only two coloured lines, red and black. Owning a games shop, McManaway sold the game directly and following customer feedback continued to change the rules and design. In 1991, the tiles were changed to plastic and two more colours were added, allowing for four-player games.
The tiles were (and still are) hand-painted, featuring different colours to those now used, even pink. The early form of the game featured eight &quot;triple intersections&quot;, but these were found to slow the game play as they only fitted into three different forced spaces (compared to six for all other tiles). So in 1993, the triple intersections were removed from the game.

Along with the multiplayer version of the game, McManaway created smaller solitaire puzzles using 10 or 12 tiles that required the player to put the tiles together to create loops of certain colours.

McManaway has also created many solitaire puzzles, including 3-D versions, match only versions (requiring players to colour match tiles within a confined space) and loop and line versions (requiring players to use all the nominated tiles to complete a loop or line in a specific colour). However many of the editions are no longer available.

The main versions sold in most countries are:

#: A solo version, consisting of 10 tiles, where players attempt puzzles that take between 30 seconds and 45 minutes.
#: A set of 14 tiles designed to play &quot;Tantrix Solitaire&quot; combined with expanded &quot;Tantrix Discovery&quot; puzzles.
#: &quot;Tantrix&quot; meets sudoku. A number of pre-placed clues controls the difficulty of each puzzle.
#: A bag with all 56 &quot;Tantrix&quot; tiles, with which players can play all editions of &quot;Tantrix&quot;.
Tantrix got its first big contract in 1994 when Air France bought the game to give to children on its flights. In 2003 Tantrix was named Toy of the Year in Hungary and won the British National Association of Toy and Leisure Libraries gold award in the games category.

<doc id="691281" wikidata="Q476539" url="?curid=691281" title="Coupe de la Ligue">
<text>The Coupe de la Ligue (), known outside France as the French League Cup, was a knockout cup competition in French football organized by the Ligue de Football Professionnel. The tournament was established in 1993 and, unlike the Coupe de France, was only open to professional clubs in France which play in country&#x27;s top three football divisions, though the third is not fully professional.

The most successful team in the competition was Paris Saint-Germain with nine wins, including the last edition in 2019–20. The LFP voted to suspend the competition indefinitely to &quot;reduce the season schedule&quot;.

==Precursors==

Another competition named Coupe de la Ligue existed from 1963 to 1965. In 1982, a Coupe d&#x27;Eté (Summer cup) was held before the start of the French league season; the cup was won by Laval. This tournament continued under the name of Coupe de la Ligue, until 1994, before the beginning of the French season. (The 1991 edition was open only for Division 2 Teams).

==History==

The tournament in its last format started in 1994 and was initiated by the professional teams because of their displeasure with the Coupe de France, thanks to its built-in home advantage for teams playing in the lower leagues. Entrance to the UEFA Cup, now called the UEFA Europa League, was offered to the winning team. Its first winner was Paris Saint-Germain, after their 2–0 victory over Bastia. The first final decided by a penalty shootout was in 1996 when Metz beat Lyon. The first three finals were held at Parc des Princes; from 1998 edition until 2015, the finals have been held at the Stade de France. Strasbourg and Paris Saint-Germain won the competition at both stadiums. Gueugnon became the first team below the top division of France to win the cup after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the 2000 final. Overall, there were 14 winners of the competition since its inception.

For over 20 years from its inception, finals of the tournament were only held in the Paris area: the first three were at the Parc des Princes and the rest at the Stade de France. This changed in September 2016 when the LFP announced that the next three finals would be held in Lyon, Bordeaux and Lille respectively. The LFP suspended the competition indefinitely after the 2019–20 season, to reduce fixture congestion. In the last final in 2020, Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon drew 0–0 and the former won 6–5 on penalties.

<doc id="691284" wikidata="Q976634" url="?curid=691284" title="Sevillanas">
<text>Sevillanas () are a type of folk music and dance of Sevilla and its region. They were derived from the Seguidilla, an old Castilian folk music and dance genre. In the nineteenth century they were influenced by Flamenco. They have a relatively limited musical pattern but are rich in lyrics based on country life, virgins, country towns, neighborhoods, pilgrimage, and love themes. 

&quot;Sevillanas&quot; can be heard mainly in fairs and festivals, including the famous Seville Fair (&quot;Feria de abril de Sevilla&quot;). Among local groups that perform it are the Los Romeros de la Puebla, Los Amigos de Gines, Las Corraleras de Lebrija, Cantores de Hispalis, and Los del Río.

Sevillanas Rocieras are a religiously oriented genre of the Sevillana, with a particular emphasis on the Virgin of El Rocío. They are sung in numerous religious and cultural events in the South of the country.

==Dance==
Sevillanas are danced by couples of all ages and sexes during celebrations (&quot;fiestas&quot; or &quot;ferias&quot;), often by whole families and towns. Sevillana choreography is characterized by stability and functionality, since it is a festival dance. This is why those intending to dance flamenco usually start by learning sevillanas; they are easier to master and there are more occasions for practice and training.

The rhythm of Sevillanas can be interpreted as 3/4, although it is generally 6/8.
Each sevillana is composed of four or sometimes seven parts, with each part divided into three &quot;coplas&quot; and with each &quot;copla&quot; made up of six movements. During festivals and shows, it is often the Sevillana dancing visitors to Andalusia mistakenly take as Flamenco, as it is a vivid style, full of turns.

<text>Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye (5 April 1822 – 3 January 1892) was a Belgian economist. He was one of the co-founders of the Institut de Droit International in 1873.

==Biography==
De Lavaleye was born in Bruges, and educated there and at the Collège Stanislas in Paris, a celebrated establishment in the hands of the Oratorians.

He continued his studies at the Catholic University of Louvain and afterwards at Ghent, where he came under the influence of the philosopher and Christian Socialist. In 1844 he won a prize with an essay on the language and literature of Provence. In 1847, he published &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des rois francs&quot;, and in 1861 a French version of the &quot;Nibelungenlied,&quot; but though he never lost his interest in literature and history, his most important work was in the domain of economics.

He was one of a group of young lawyers doctors and critics, all old pupils of Huet, who met once a week to discuss social and economic questions and thus was led to publish his views on these subjects. In 1859 some articles by him in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; laid the foundation of his reputation as an economist. In 1864 he was elected to the chair of political economy at the state University of Liège. Here he wrote his most important works:
* &quot;La Russie et l&#x27;Autriche depuis Sadowa&quot;, 1870.
* &quot;Essai sur les Formes de Gouvernement dans les Sociétés Modernes&quot;, 1872.
* &quot;Des Causes Actuelles de Guerre en Europe et de l&#x27;Arbitrage&quot;, 1874.
* &quot;De la Proprieté et de ses Formes Primitives,&quot; 1874 (dedicated to the memories of John Stuart Mill and François Huet)

==Death and legacy==
He died at the Doyon Castle (in present-day Havelange), near Liège on 3 January 1892.

Laveleye&#x27;s activity included the whole realm of political science, political economy, monetary questions, international law, foreign and Belgian politics, questions of education, religion and morality, travel and literature. He had the art of popularizing even the most technical subjects, owing to the clearness of his view and his firm grasp of the matter in hand. He was especially attracted to England, where he thought he saw many of his ideals of social, political and religious progress realized. He was a frequent contributor to the English newspapers and leading reviews. The most widely circulated of his works was a pamphlet on &quot;Le Parti clérical en Belgique&quot;, of which 2,000,000 copies had been circulated in ten languages by the beginning of the 20th century.

<text>Uranius is the name of two possible Roman usurpers of the third century AD.

The first Uranius is mentioned only by Zosimus, and was briefly active during the latter part of the reign of Alexander Severus. He was chosen by dissatisfied soldiers along the Danube and from a lowly background. There is little confirmatory evidence of his existence.

A second, and better attested usurper was Lucius Julius Aurelius Sulpicius Severus Uranius Antoninus, who appears to have been active in Syria in the early 250s AD. Coins minted in Emesa have been found bearing his name, and invoking the local deity Sol Invictus. Some scholars have connected him to an Emesan priest active in this period, known as Sampsiceramus.

It is not clear whether the coins that were struck in Syria belong to the same man (or men) spoken about in the texts. If the later date is correct Uranius might have helped defend the Roman Empire against Shapur I, the Sassanid king of Persia. 

What happened to him after his claim on the throne is not known.

<doc id="691293" wikidata="Q392937" url="?curid=691293" title="The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism">
<text>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism () is a book written by Max Weber, a German sociologist, economist, and politician. First written as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in 1930. It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and a milestone contribution to sociological thought in general.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism. In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses Lutherans (especially Pietists, but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and Moravians (specifically referring to the Herrnhut-based community under Count von Zinzendorf&#x27;s spiritual lead).

In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century, after Weber&#x27;s &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, C. Wright Mills&#x27; &quot;The Sociological Imagination&quot;, and Robert K. Merton&#x27;s &quot;Social Theory and Social Structure&quot;. It is the eighth most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber&#x27;s later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (&quot;The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism&quot; 1915, &quot;The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism&quot; 1916, and &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot; 1917), &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; argues that Puritan ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. The &#x27;spirit of capitalism&#x27; does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of Benjamin Franklin:

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any &quot;sacred&quot; calling (German: ). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the work ethic in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending &quot;less&quot; time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft. To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a &quot;calling&quot; would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a Pietist background.

He defines the spirit of capitalism as the ideas and &quot;esprit&quot; that favour the rational pursuit of economic gain: &quot;We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression &#x27;spirit of capitalism&#x27; for that attitude which, &quot;in the pursuit of a calling []&quot;, strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin.&quot;

Weber points out that such a spirit is not limited to Western culture if one considers it as the attitude of individuals, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism). He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it. Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes. As he wrote in his essays:

After defining the &quot;spirit of capitalism,&quot; Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the Reformation. Many others like William Petty, Montesquieu, Henry Thomas Buckle, John Keats have noted the affinity between Protestantism and the development of commercialism.

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the Reformation, though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages. The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church&#x27;s sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a psychological viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or &quot;religious geniuses&quot; within Protestantism, such as Martin Luther, were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other &quot;signs&quot; that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of double predestination, in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one&#x27;s own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin&#x27;s followers, who, in Weber&#x27;s view, considered it an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God&#x27;s grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe&#x27;s emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther&#x27;s conclusions, noting that a &quot;vocation&quot; from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the &quot;Protestant Ethic&quot;, he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the &quot;unio mystica&quot; that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate &quot;Luther, the symbolic exponent of bureaucratic despotism, with the ascetic hostility to Eros — an example of Weber&#x27;s sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives.&quot;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in Lutheranism, which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in Calvinistic forms of Christianity. The trend was carried further still in Pietism. The Baptists diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.

What Weber argued, in simple terms:

* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ) with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a sin. Donations to an individual&#x27;s church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of icons. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to charity was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this dilemma was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to nascent capitalism.

===Protestant work ethic in Weber&#x27;s time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of Benjamin Franklin, which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism&#x27;s spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic systems in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and observation, the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from magic, that that could be seen as a unique characteristic of Western culture.

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun work on &quot;The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects&quot;. Another reason for Weber&#x27;s decision was that Troeltsch&#x27;s work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into sociology of religion within his later works (the study of Judaism and the religions of China and India).

This book is also Weber&#x27;s first brush with the concept of rationalization. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the &quot;spirit&quot; of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Capitalism&quot; is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber&#x27;s criticism of Karl Marx and his theories. While Marx&#x27;s historical materialism held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen &quot;The Protestant Ethic&quot; as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber&#x27;s argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, &quot;it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth.&quot; Weber&#x27;s argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of &#x27;material&#x27; and &#x27;ideal&#x27; factors.

==Criticism==

===Methodology===
Weber&#x27;s causal claim that the Protestant ethic led to capitalism has been criticized for endogeneity problems and case selection problems. Rather than Protestantism leading to capitalism, it may be the case that individuals and communities who were more prone to capitalism were also more likely to adopt Protestantism.

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian Henryk Grossman criticises Weber&#x27;s analysis on two fronts. Firstly, Grossman refers to Karl Marx&#x27;s work to show that the stringent legal measures that were taken against poverty and vagabondage were a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the enclosure of the commons, which evicted many peasants from the common land on which they had lived. Secondly, Grossman&#x27;s own work shows how this &quot;bloody legislation&quot; against evicted peasants was implemented across Europe, especially in France. Grossman asserts that this legislation physically forced people from serfdom into wage-labor. This history is unrelated to Protestantism. Thus, capitalism came about largely by force, and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism. It remains possible that the &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot; socially legitimized or otherwise reinforced the legal measures that Grossman details, within a larger cultural context.

In a 2015 study, Davide Cantoni tested Weber&#x27;s Protestant hypothesis on German cities over the period 1300–1900, finding no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. 

Historian Laurence R. Iannaccone has written that &quot;Ironically, the most noteworthy feature of the Protestant Ethic thesis is its absence of empirical support&quot;, citing the work of Swedish economic historian Kurt Samuelsson that &quot;economic progress was uncorrelated with religion, or was temporally incompatible with Weber&#x27;s thesis, or actually reversed the pattern claimed by Weber.&quot;

Other recent scholarship has found some valid Protestant ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns. Dudley and Blum, using city growth as a proxy for wages growth, write:

Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson in their book &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot; reject the relationship between economic progress and Protestantism writing:
===Revisionist criticism===
Hector Menteith Robertson, in his book &quot;Aspects of Economic Individualism&quot; (1933), argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson pointed out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th-century Italy, so the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to Adam Smith, the Protestant Reformation, etc. Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Robertson shows that Adam Smith and David Ricardo did not found economic science &quot;de novo&quot;. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the Scholastics. According to other critics, British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the labor theory of value, which had been critiqued by the School of Salamanca.

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the &quot;Protestant ethics&quot; but rather through the promotion of literacy. Sascha Becker and Ludger Wossmann of the University of Munich showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.

Weber&#x27;s conclusion has also been criticized for ignoring the ethnic dimensions. Weber focused on religion, but ignored the fact that Germany contained a large Polish minority (due to the partitions of Poland); and Poles were primarily Catholic and Germans, Protestant. As such, scholars have suggested that what Weber observed was in fact &quot;anti-Polish discrimination&quot; visible in the different levels of income, savings and literacy between Germans and Poles.

The noted French historian Fernand Braudel, considered one of the greatest of the modern historians, vigorously criticized Weber&#x27;s theory, noting its lack of foundation and veracity, stating:
==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist Gerhard Lenski conducted an empirical inquiry into &quot;religion&#x27;s impact on politics, economics, and family life&quot; in the Detroit, Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski&#x27;s data supported basic hypotheses of Weber&#x27;s work &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. According to Lenski, &quot;the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber&#x27;s theory.&quot; Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, had observed that &quot;diligence and frugality&quot; made Methodists wealthy. &quot;In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations.&quot;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: &quot;Sociologists of religion like Peter L. Berger and David Martin have interpreted the Protestant revolution in Latin America as implicit support of basic elements of Weber&#x27;s thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant Pentecostal congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes.&quot;

In a journal article published in 2019, scholar of religion Benjamin Kirby critiques Peter L. Berger&#x27;s analysis for its over-emphasis on the influence of Holiness-oriented Pentecostal churches, neglecting the growing influence of neo-Pentecostal churches across the globe. Kirby argues that it is difficult to draw parallels between contemporary neo-Pentecostals and Weber&#x27;s ascetic Protestants, specifically because the former group of practitioners, many of whom espouse Prosperity theologies, often do not exhibit the same commitment to &quot;sober economic virtue&quot; and &quot;rational bourgeois economic life&quot; as Weber&#x27;s Calvinistic Puritans. Nevertheless, Kirby stresses that Weber&#x27;s text remains important for understanding enduring affinities between Christianity and capitalism. Kirby posits a &quot;new elective affinity&quot; between contemporary Pentecostalism and neoliberal capitalism, suggesting that neo-Pentecostal churches may act as vehicles for embedding neoliberal economic processes, for instance by encouraging practitioners to become entrepreneurial, responsibilised citizens.

<text>The Coupe de France (), also known in English as the French Cup or less commonly as the France Cup, is the premier knockout cup competition in French football organised by the French Football Federation (FFF). It was first held in 1917 and is open to all amateur and professional football clubs in France, including clubs based in the overseas departments and territories. Between 1917 and 1919, the competition was called the Coupe Charles Simon, in tribute of Charles Simon, a French sportsman and the founder of the French Interfederal Committee (the ancestor of the French Football Federation), who died in 1915 while serving in World War I. The final is played at the Stade de France and the winner qualifies for the group stage of the UEFA Europa League and a place in the Trophée des Champions match. A concurrent women&#x27;s tournament is also held, the Coupe de France Féminine.

Combined with random draws and one-off matches (no replays), the Coupe de France can be difficult for the bigger clubs to win. The competition is usually beneficial to the amateur clubs as it forces higher-ranked clubs, usually professional clubs, to play as the away team when drawn against lower-league opposition if they are competing more than one level below them. Despite this advantage, only three amateur clubs have reached the final since professionalism was introduced in French football in 1932: Calais RUFC in 2000, US Quevilly in 2012 and Les Herbiers VF in 2018. Two clubs from outside Ligue 1 have won the competition, Le Havre in 1959 and Guingamp in 2009. The reigning champions are Paris Saint-Germain, who defeated Lyon in the final of the 2023–24 competition.

==History==

The Coupe de France was created on 15 January 1917 by the &quot;French Interfederal Committee&quot; (CFI), an early predecessor of the French Football Federation. The idea was pushed by the federation&#x27;s general secretary Henri Delaunay and under &quot;union sacrée&quot;, the competition was declared open to all clubs, amateur and professional, though professionalism in French football at the time was non-existent. The major clubs in France objected to the notion that all clubs should be allowed to enter. However, the federation dispelled their complaints and declared the competition would remain as is. Due to the minimal requirements to enter, the first competition featured 48 clubs. By 1948, the number had increased to 1,000 and at present, the competition features more than 7,000 clubs. Due to the initial increase in clubs, the federation created preliminary rounds beginning with the 1919–20 season. The following season, they added a second preliminary round. As of today, the competition contains eight regional rounds with some regions containing as many as ten.

The first Coupe de France victors were Olympique de Pantin who defeated FC Lyon 3–0 at the Stade de la Légion Saint-Michel in Paris in front of 2,000 spectators. The following year, the competition was shifted to the Parc des Princes and drew 10,000 supporters to the final that saw CASG Paris defeat Olympique de Paris 3–2. The competition alternated between many stadiums during its early years playing at the Stade Pershing from 1920 to 1924 before switching to the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. The competition lasted a decade there before returning to the Parc des Princes in 1938. In 1941, the final was held at the Stade de Paris. The following year, the final returned to Colombes and remained there until moving to the Parc des Princes permanently following its renovation, which made it the largest in terms of attendance in France.

There are vastly more amateur than professional clubs in France, and the competition regularly produces surprises. The best performance by an amateur club in the competition is usually awarded the &quot;Petit Poucet Plaque&quot;. One of the competition&#x27;s biggest upsets occurred in February 1957 when Algerian club SCU El Biar defeated Stade de Reims who had players such as Robert Jonquet, Michel Hidalgo, Léon Glovacki, and Just Fontaine. One of the more recent successes of an amateur club occurred during the 1999–2000 competition when Championnat de France amateur club Calais RUFC reached the final. Calais, composed of doctors, dock workers, and office clerks, started the competition in the 5th round and, after defeating fellow amateurs, beat clubs Lille, Langon-Castets, Cannes, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux to advance to the final. Calais&#x27; road to the final was a prime example of the major advantages amateur clubs had with the club playing all of its matches at home beginning with the Round of 64 match. In the final the club lost to Nantes 2–1 despite scoring first.

Professional clubs have continued to express their displeasure with the advantages amateur clubs receive in the competition with many of their complaints being directly associated with their hosting of matches. Coupe de France rules explicitly state that teams drawn first during the draw are granted hosting duties for the round, however, if the club drawn second is competing two levels below the club drawn first, then the hosting duties will be given to the second club drawn. Many clubs have subsequently complained that, due to the amateur clubs not having adequate funds, the stadiums they play in are extremely unkempt. The resulting differences led to the clubs represented by the Ligue de Football Professionnel forming their own cup competition, the Coupe de la Ligue. More recently, amateur clubs have begun to move to more established stadiums for their Coupe de France matches with their primary reason being to earn more money at the gate due to more established stadiums having the ability to carry more spectators.

The winner of the Coupe de France trophy normally holds on to the trophy for one year to put in on display at their headquarters before returning it to the French Football Federation. In the early 1980s, the cup was stolen, but was retrieved by the authorities quickly. Since 1927, the President of France has always attended the cup final and presented the trophy to the winning team&#x27;s captain. Gaston Doumergue was the first French president to attend the final.

==Competition format==
Similar to other countries&#x27; cup competitions, the Coupe de France is a knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn at random. Each tie is played through a single leg. If a match ends in a draw, penalties are held. Prior to 1967, the competition had no extra time nor penalty shootouts and instead allowed replays, similar to the FA Cup. This style was abandoned following three straight draws between Olympique Lyonnais and amateur club Angoulême CFC, which resulted in the federation flipping a coin to decide which club advanced. For the 1968–69 season, extra time was introduced and, two years later, the penalty shootout was instituted. Following the 1974–75 season, replays were scrapped.

There are a total of 14 rounds in the competition. However, rounds in the competition are determined through each region in France with one of the main reasons being to reduce travel costs. Depending on the region, the number of rounds may vary from four to as many as eight with each region sending a set number of clubs to the 7th round. The regions conduct rounds of matches up until the 7th round when professional clubs enter the competition. All of the clubs are then split and drawn against each other randomly, regardless of regional affiliation though geographical pots are made prior to the draw. In the overseas departments and territories, territories such as Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion establish their own knockout competition, similar to the regions in France, though only one club from each region is allowed to enter. This number later rose to two for some overseas regions. Territories like Mayotte, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia allow the winner of their cup competitions to enter the 7th round, such as when AS Mont-Dore won the 2009 edition of the New Caledonia Cup to earn qualification for the 2009–10 Coupe de France.

As well as being presented with the trophy, the winning team also qualifies for the UEFA Europa League. If the winner has already qualified for the UEFA Champions League via the league, the UEFA Europa League place goes to the next highest placed finisher in the league table. Overseas teams are also eligible for UEFA qualification.

=== Format for the 2021–22 Coupe de France ===

* In the first two rounds the teams from district and regional leagues enter.
* National 3 teams enter at the third round stage.
* National 2 teams enter at the fourth round stage.
* National teams enter at the fifth round stage.
* Ligue 2 teams enter at the seventh round stage.
* Ligue 1 teams enter at the round of 64 stage.

==Numbering==
In Coupe de France matches, players are restricted to wearing the shirt numbers 1–20 regardless of the player&#x27;s squad number. The starters are given the numbers 1–11. Currently, matches from quarter-finals onward allow players to wear their own numbers in their clubs.

== Overseas teams ==

The cup was open to overseas teams starting in the 1961–62 season. In the 1974–75 season, the Golden Star was the first overseas team to beat a mainland team. The Martinique club beat US Melun 2–1 in the replay after 1–1 in the first game. The Golden Star was then the first overseas team to reach the round of 64. In the 1988–89 season, Le Geldar de Kourou was the first overseas team to reach the round of 32. In the 2019–20 season, JS Saint-Pierroise was the second overseas team to reach the round of 32. In the following season, Club Franciscain was the third overseas team to reach the round of 32.

==Sponsorship==
The Coupe de France does not have a primary sponsor of the competition, but allows sponsors of the French Football Federation to showcase themselves on club&#x27;s kits at the expense of the club&#x27;s sponsors. Among them include SFR, Caisse d&#x27;Épargne, Crédit Agricole, Sita-Suez, Carrefour, LG, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola.

==Records==
As of 2021, Paris Saint-Germain have a record of fourteen Coupe de France titles. PSG and Marseille have appeared in the most finals, having played in nineteen each. The Parisian club won a cup &#x27;double&#x27; (i.e. the Coupe de France and the Coupe de la Ligue in the same season) in 1995, 1998, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020. Marseille are one of four clubs who have suffered two consecutive finals defeats, as the Bouches-du-Rhône-based club lost to Paris Saint-Germain in 2006 and then to Sochaux the following season.

Due to the early dominance of Parisian clubs during the early run of the competition and along with PSG&#x27;s consistency, the Île-de-France region has the most Coupe de France champions, having produced 25. The region is followed by Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, with Marseille being the region&#x27;s most successful club.

Managers Guy Roux and André Cheuva share the honour of having managed four Coupe de France winning clubs. The most successful players are Marquinhos and Marco Verratti, who both won six titles. Éric Pécout of Nantes and Jean-Pierre Papin are joint top scorers of the competition final, having each converted a hat-trick in their only appearances in the ultimate match. In 1947, Roger Vandooren scored the fastest goal in the final&#x27;s history converting after 29 seconds for his club Lille in their 2–0 win over Strasbourg.

==Media coverage==

=== France ===
The Coupe de France currently has a broadcasting agreement with , the French public national television broadcaster, and Eurosport since the 1996–97 until 2021–22 season. The Coupe de France final is co-aired on France 2 since 1975 until 2026 (excluding 1984 until 2006).

<text>Skirmishers are light infantry or light cavalry soldiers deployed as a vanguard, flank guard or rearguard to screen a tactical position or a larger body of friendly troops from enemy advances. They may be deployed in a skirmish line, an irregular open formation that is much more spread out in depth and in breadth than a traditional line formation. Their purpose is to harass the enemy by engaging them in only light or sporadic combat to delay their movement, disrupt their attack, or weaken their morale. Such tactics are collectively called skirmishing. An engagement with only light, relatively indecisive combat is sometimes called a skirmish even if heavier troops are sometimes involved.

Skirmishers can be either regular army units that are temporarily detached to perform skirmishing or specialty units that were specifically armed and trained for such low-level irregular warfare tactics. Light infantry, light cavalry (historically), and irregular units often specialize in skirmishing. Skirmishers&#x27; open formations and smaller numbers can give them superior mobility over the regular forces, allowing them to engage only on favorable terms, taking advantage of better position or terrain, and quickly withdrawing from any threat of superior enemy forces. Though often critical in protecting the main army from sudden enemy advances, skirmishers were historically poor at taking or defending ground from heavy infantry or heavy cavalry.

==Ancient history==
In ancient warfare, skirmishers typically carried bows, javelins, slings and sometimes light shields. Acting as light infantry with their light arms and minimal armour, they could run ahead of the main battle line; release a volley of arrows, sling stones, or javelins; and retreat behind their main battle line before the clash of the opposing main forces. The aims of skirmishing were to disrupt enemy formations by causing casualties before the main battle and to tempt the opposing infantry into attacking prematurely, thus throwing their organization into disarray. Skirmishers could also be effectively used to surround opposing soldiers in the absence of friendly cavalry.

Once preliminary skirmishing was over, skirmishers participated in the main battle by shooting into the enemy formation, or they joined in melée combat with daggers or short swords. Their mobility made skirmishers also valuable for reconnaissance, especially in wooded or urban areas.

In Classical Greece, skirmishers originally had a low status. For example, Herodotus, in his account of the Battle of Plataea of 479 BC, mentioned that the Spartan Army fielded 35,000 lightly armed helots to 5,000 hoplites, but there is no mention of them in his account of the fighting. Often, Greek historians ignored them altogether, but Xenophon distinguished them explicitly from the statary troops. It was far cheaper to equip oneself as lightly armed than a fully-armed hoplite. Indeed, it was common for the lightly armed to go into battle equipped with stones. The low status of skirmishers reflected the low status of the poorer sections of society that made up skirmishers. Additionally, hit-and-run tactics went against the Greek ideal of heroism. Plato gives the skirmisher a voice to advocate &quot;flight without shame&quot; but only to denounce it as an inversion of decent values.

Nevertheless, skirmishers then chalked up significant victories, such as the Athenian defeat at the hands of the Aetolian javelin men in 426 BC and, during the same war, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Sphacteria.

Skirmisher infantry gained more respect in subsequent years, as their usefulness was more widely recognised and as the ancient bias against them waned. Peltasts, light javelin infantry, played a vital role in the Peloponnesian War, and well-equipped skirmisher troops such as &quot;thureophoroi&quot; and &quot;thorakites&quot; would be developed to provide a strong mobile force for the Greek and the Macedonian armies.

The Celts did not, in general, favour ranged weapons. The exceptions tended not to include the use of skirmishers. The Britons used the sling and javelin extensively but for siege warfare, not skirmishing. Among the Gauls, likewise, the bow was employed to defend a fixed position. The Celts&#x27; lack of skirmishers cost them dearly during the Gallic Invasion of Greece of 279 BC when they found themselves helpless in the face of Aetolian skirmishing tactics. Thracians were famous for their skirmish war tactics and offered their services as mercenaries more than once in the Greek civil wars in ancient times.

In the Punic Wars, despite the Roman and Carthaginian armies&#x27; different organisations, both had the role for skirmishers as screening the main armies. The Roman legions had a specialised infantry class, Velites, which acted as skirmish troops who engaged the enemy before the Roman heavy infantry made contact, and the Carthaginians recruited their skirmishers from the native peoples across the Carthaginian Empire.

The Roman army of the late republican and early imperial periods frequently recruited foreign auxiliary troops to act as skirmishers to supplement the citizen legions.

==Middle Ages==
Medieval skirmishers were generally commoners armed with crossbows or longbows. In the 14th century, although long held in by the aristocratic Castilian heavy cavalry, the crossbowmen contributed greatly to the Portuguese victory at the Battle of Aljubarrota. Similarly, English archers played a key role in the English victory over French heavy cavalry at the Battle of Crécy. In the next century, they largely repeated that feat at the Battle of Agincourt. Such disasters have been seen as marking the beginning of the end of the dominance of medieval cavalry in general and of the heavy cavalry in particular.

==Early modern period==
===Americas===
The Seven Years&#x27; War and American Revolutionary War were two early conflicts in which the modern rifle began to make a significant contribution to warfare. Despite its lower rate of fire, its accuracy at long range offered advantages over the smoothbore musket, then commonly used by regular armies. In both wars, many American frontiersmen served in the militia. The Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War was assisted by such irregular troops, such as the Minutemen, who engaged in skirmishing tactics by firing from cover, rather than in the open-field engagements that were customary at the time. Their tactics were influenced by experiences in fighting Native Americans. Militia in a skirmish role was particularly effective in the Battle of Cowpens. The character of Natty Bumppo in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; was notably called &quot;La Longue Carabine&quot; by the French because of his skill with the long rifle, which was common among the Colonials.

===Napoleonic Wars===
During the Napoleonic Wars, skirmishers played a key role in battles; they attempted to disrupt the main enemy force by firing into their close-packed ranks and to prevent enemy skirmishers from doing the same to friendly troops. Because skirmishers generally fought in open order, they could take cover behind trees, houses, towers and similar items, thereby presenting unrewarding targets for small arms and artillery fire. Such tactics often made them vulnerable to cavalry. Some skirmishers had a minor sapper role by placing &quot;cheval de frise&quot; to deter cavalry.

A skirmish force screening the main body of infantry became so important to any army in the field that eventually, all major European powers developed specialised skirmishing infantry. Examples included the German &quot;Jäger&quot;, the French &quot;voltigeurs&quot; and the British riflemen.

Muskets were the predominant infantry weapon of the late 18th century, but the British Army learned firsthand of the importance of rifles during the American Revolutionary War and began experimenting with them shortly thereafter, resulting in the Baker rifle. Although slower to reload and more costly to produce than a musket, it was much more accurate and proved its worth during the Peninsular War. Throughout the conflict, British riflemen could selectively target and eliminate the officers and NCOs of French forces from outside musket range.

During the War of 1812, American riflemen again contributed to British casualties but also had to contend with the revised British light infantry tactics.

A consequence of those wars&#x27; experiences was a trend to training line troops to adopt tactics that had been used only by skirmishers.

===American Civil War===
The treatise &quot;New American Tactics&quot;, by General John Watts de Peyster, advocated making the skirmish line the new line of battle, which was then a revolutionary idea. During the American Civil War, cavalrymen often dismounted and formed a skirmish line to delay enemy troops who were advancing toward an objective. An example was the action of the Union cavalrymen led by Brigadier General John Buford on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Skirmish lines were also used to harass enemy probing missions, hampering the other force from gaining an effective intelligence picture by engaging their scouts, and likewise forcing them to deploy.

==Late modern period==
By the late 19th century, the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane. Heavy infantry had disappeared, and all infantry effectively became skirmishers. The term has become obsolete, but as late as World War I, it continued to be associated with battlefield reconnaissance screens, which are essentially modern skirmish lines. As in the American Civil War, the primary role of the infantry skirmish line was to screen the advance of a parent force and to disrupt the enemy&#x27;s own reconnaissance efforts. With the mechanization of modern warfare, the role of infantry skirmishers was more or less combined with those of light cavalry, as mounted scouts in specialized reconnaissance vehicles took over the responsibility of screening large formations during maneuvers, in addition to conducting their own probing actions.

===Cold War and beyond===
Apartheid South Africa&#x27;s military doctrine stressed the use of highly-mobile, light-mechanized forces that could cover ground swiftly while they kept heavier enemy armoured and infantry formations off balance and did not engage until the conditions were favourable. The lightly armed South African units used tactics such as rapid movement, flank harassment and confusing the enemy with continuous maneuvering to compensate for their inferiority in firepower when they were faced with Angolan and Cuban forces during the South African Border War. The innovative use of South African reconnaissance units to throw Angolan tank formations into disarray before it lured them into ambushes, effectively deploying the units as skirmishers, was another consistent feature of that conflict.

<doc id="691304" wikidata="Q4140918" url="?curid=691304" title="Robert Howe (Continental Army officer)">
<text>Robert Howe (; c. 1732 – December 14, 1786) was a Continental Army general from the Province of North Carolina during the American Revolutionary War. The descendant of a prominent family in North Carolina, Howe was one of five generals, and the only major general, in the Continental Army from that state. He also played a role in the colonial and state governments of North Carolina, serving in the legislative bodies of both.

Howe served in the colonial militia during the French and Indian War and commanded Fort Johnston at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. He also served as a colonel of Royal Governor William Tryon&#x27;s artillery during the War of the Regulation. Howe suffered greatly when Tryon, a personal friend, became Governor of New York, and he staunchly opposed Tryon&#x27;s successor. He became active in organizing efforts within North Carolina and among the American colonies between 1773 and 1775 and was an active member of the North Carolina Provincial Congress. At the outset of the Revolutionary War, Howe was promoted to brigadier general and was heavily involved in actions in the Southern Department, commanding the Continental Army and Patriot militia forces in defeat in the First Battle of Savannah.

Howe&#x27;s career as a military commander was contentious and consumed primarily by conflict with political and military leaders in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, he fought a duel with Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina which was spurred in part by Howe&#x27;s conflict with South Carolina&#x27;s state government. Political and personal confrontations, combined with Howe&#x27;s reputation as a womanizer among those who disfavored him, eventually led to the Continental Congress stripping him of his command over the Southern Department. He was then sent to New York, where he served under General George Washington in the Hudson Highlands, although Howe did not have a successful or significant career in that theater. He sat as a senior officer on the court-martial board that sentenced to death John André, a British officer accused of assisting Benedict Arnold in the latter&#x27;s plot to change allegiance and deliver West Point to the British. Howe himself was accused of attempting to defect to the British, but the accusations were cast aside at the time as having been based in a British attempt to cause further discord in the Continental Army. Howe also played a role in putting down several late-war mutinies by members of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Lines in New Jersey and Philadelphia and returned home to North Carolina in 1783. He again became active in state politics, but died in December 1786 while en route to a session of the North Carolina House of Commons.

==Early life and family==

Howe was born in 1732 to Job Howe (also spelled &quot;Howes&quot;), the grandson of Governor James Moore, who presided over the southern portion of the Province of Carolina. Job was also a descendant of Governor John Yeamans. Howe&#x27;s mother may have been Job&#x27;s first wife Martha, who was the daughter of colonial North Carolina jurist Frederick Jones. Job Howe&#x27;s ancestors had been planters and political figures in South Carolina during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Prior to Howe&#x27;s birth, his family left Charleston to settle on the banks of the Cape Fear River in the Province of North Carolina. Howe&#x27;s father was a member of the extended Moore family, formerly of South Carolina, who settled the lower Cape Fear River and collectively owned more than of farmland on it by the 1730s. Job Howe died in 1748, leaving his estate and the wealth of his parents to Robert. Robert had two brothers and two sisters, all of whom were mentioned in Job&#x27;s will.

As a young boy, Howe may have been sent to England to obtain an education, although several sources doubt that Howe made the journey. At some point between 1751 and 1754, after completing his education, Howe married Sarah Grange, who was heiress to a large fortune. Howe had numerous affairs, fathering an unknown number of children in and out of wedlock, including a son, Robert; two daughters, Mary and Ann; and up to four additional daughters whose mothers&#x27; names are not recorded. Howe was widely considered a womanizer by contemporaries; by 1772 he became estranged from Grange, and the two separated. In the year of their formal separation, Howe recorded a deed for the support of his wife.

Loyalist sympathizer and diarist Janet Schaw described Howe prior to the revolution:

Howe inherited a large amount of assets from his grandmother and, upon the death of his father, became the owner of &quot;Howe&#x27;s Point&quot; a plantation on the Cape Fear River, as well as a rice plantation near what was formerly known as Barren Inlet (now called Mason Inlet). The site of the former plantation is located on the mainland directly across from Figure Eight Island. Howe also owned a plantation called &quot;Mount Misery&quot; in what was Bladen County. His grandmother had provided Howe with slaves and money with which Howe was intended to build his fortune.

==Colonial political and military service==
Around 1755, Howe captained a militia company in Bladen County, and was appointed a justice of the peace for that county in 1756. Howe was elected to the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses from Bladen County in 1760 and served until 1762. In 1764, the Assembly created Brunswick County, and Howe was both appointed its justice of the peace and re-elected to the Assembly from the new county. Howe would be re-elected six more times from Brunswick County. In 1765, Howe worked with other colonial leaders such as Hugh Waddell, Abner Nash, and Cornelius Harnett to found the Wilmington Sons of Liberty organization, which was active in protesting the Stamp Act 1765 that taxed most printed materials. At the time, the members of the Sons of Liberty did not consider their resistance to be rebellion, as it was based on the idea that government officials who performed acts in opposition to the will of the people were not acting with full authority. After the resolution of the Stamp Act Crisis, Howe was made an officer of the provincial exchequer. Despite the Cape Fear River area being the epicenter of Stamp Act protests in North Carolina, Howe took no substantial part in the active confrontations with Governor William Tryon, due in large part to their personal friendship and the patronage provided by the Governor for Howe&#x27;s political ambitions.

During the French and Indian War, Howe served alongside provincial soldiers from Virginia. In 1766, he was commissioned as a captain of militia and was given command of Fort Johnston, located at the entrance of the Cape Fear River in present-day Southport, North Carolina. Howe served in this capacity between 1766 and 1767, and again between 1769 and 1773. Although satisfied with this position, Howe ultimately desired to obtain a commission in the regular British Army, which was traditionally a prerequisite for the commander of Fort Johnston. Howe was never granted this commission, despite Tryon&#x27;s support. In the 1768 session of the colonial assembly, Howe played a prominent role by introducing a bill to remedy a currency shortage in the colony. His bill would have led to the acceptance of commodities as legal tender in the province, but it was not passed. The Regulator movement was in part based on the grievances farmers in the North Carolina backcountry had about back taxes and pressure from private creditors, both of which Howe&#x27;s 1768 bill had attempted to address.

Despite his efforts to reform the province&#x27;s policies, Howe was made a colonel of artillery by Governor Tryon and served under the Governor against armed protesters in the piedmont during the War of the Regulation. Howe was among the Governor&#x27;s entourage when he confronted the Regulators in Hillsborough in 1768, and in 1771, at the Battle of Alamance, Howe served in a dual role as a commander of artillery and quartermaster general. In early 1773, when Josiah Quincy II visited North Carolina to foster cooperation between Southern activists and those in Boston, he investigated the causes of the War of the Regulation to which he had been sympathetic. Howe served as Quincy&#x27;s guide and with the assistance of Cornelius Harnett and William Hooper convinced Quincy that the Regulator movement had been unjustified and wrong to take up arms against Tryon. Quincy found Howe to be a &quot;most happy compound of the man of sense, the sword, the Senate, and the buck ... a favorite of the man of sense and the female world&quot;, continuing to say that &quot;[Howe] has faults and vice – but alas who is without them.&quot; More importantly, however, Quincy&#x27;s visit with Howe, Hooper, and Harnett engendered a desire among those present to open up inter-colonial lines of communication in order to coordinate responses to future impositions by the British government.

Howe&#x27;s private fortunes were never stable, and between 1766 and 1775, he was forced to mortgage land and sell slaves to generate funds. In 1770, Howe was able to purchase Kendal Plantation on the Cape Fear River, a rice plantation, but in 1775, he mortgaged it for around £214. While the causes of Howe&#x27;s financial misfortunes are unknown, several contemporary critics held that the cause was Howe&#x27;s need to keep up appearances among the ruling elite, while Josiah Martin, Tryon&#x27;s successor as Royal Governor, believed Howe&#x27;s misfortunes were evidence of his potential for malfeasance with the public money. In particular, Martin believed that Howe was intentionally under-staffing Fort Johnston in order to pocket excess funds the colonial assembly had appropriated for the garrison there, which was a common form of embezzlement among previous commanders and other royal officials. Howe, as a legislator and public official, had a poor working relationship with Martin, and Martin deprived him of his appointed offices – the captaincy of Fort Johnston and his position with the provincial exchequer – shortly after the new governor&#x27;s arrival. A legislative confrontation in 1770 over the Provincial Assembly&#x27;s attempts to pass a law authorizing attachment of real property in North Carolina owned by persons living in England placed Howe in direct confrontation with Martin, who preferred a requirement that colonial subjects seek relief from courts in England rather than in North Carolina. Martin believed that Howe&#x27;s virulent opposition to the new governor&#x27;s policies was driven by Howe&#x27;s anger at being deprived of his valuable appointed positions.

==Revolutionary political and militia service==
In December 1773, the North Carolina colonial assembly created a committee of correspondence, to which Howe, as well as Richard Caswell, John Harvey, John Ashe, Joseph Hewes, and Samuel Johnston were appointed. That committee was tasked with corresponding with other colonies to coordinate plans of resistance to British attempts to tax or otherwise burden the colonists. Beginning in 1774, Howe was a member of the Wilmington and Brunswick County Committees of Safety, and in August of that year, served as a member of a committee that organized the collection of corn, flour, and pork to be sent to Boston. At the time, the Port of Boston had been closed by one of the Intolerable Acts, specifically the Boston Port Act, which was in reaction to the Boston Tea Party and other protests against the Tea Act.

When the First Provincial Congress convened on August 25, 1774, Howe served as a member of that body representing Brunswick County. The First Provincial Congress quickly passed a bill banning the exportation of all pitch, tobacco, tar, and other trade goods to England and banned the importation of British tea into North Carolina. Also in 1774, Howe penned several documents expressing what would become known as Patriot or &quot;whig&quot; sympathies, including an address demanding reforms from Royal Governor Josiah Martin. On April 7, 1775, Howe delivered an address to the colonial assembly formally rebuffing Governor Martin&#x27;s demands that the extra-legal Second Provincial Congress be dissolved. Howe&#x27;s response as adopted by the assembly led to Martin proroguing the colonial legislative body. In 1775, when Howe received news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War, he began to drill the local militia, using the unusual combination of drums and fiddles as opposed to the standard fifes and drums.

On July 15, 1775, Howe led 500 militiamen from Brunswick Town on a raid on the governor&#x27;s mansion with the intent of kidnapping Governor Martin. The plot failed when Martin made an early-morning escape from Fort Johnston, fleeing to on July 19. Howe ordered the militia to put the fort&#x27;s structures to the torch, starting with the home of its commanding officer and Howe&#x27;s successor, Captain John Collet, who had previously been accused of corruption by the Committee of Safety. After fleeing, Martin made a proclamation on August 8, 1775, that attributed the growing unrest in North Carolina to what he termed &quot;&#x27;the basest and most scandalous Seditious and inflammatory falsehoods&#x27;&quot; propagated by the Committee of Safety in Wilmington.

Howe once again represented Brunswick County in the Third Provincial Congress in Hillsborough beginning on August 20, 1775, and was appointed to the committee charged with developing a test oath for members of the legislative body. The oath declared allegiance to the King of England but denied the power of Parliament to tax to American colonies. During the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress in 1776, Howe was noted to have proclaimed that &quot;&#x27;Independence seems to be the word. I know not one of the dissenting voice.&#x27;&quot;

==Continental Army service==

===Burning of Norfolk===

On September 1, 1775, the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress appointed Howe to lead the newly created Second North Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army as its colonel. Initially, Howe headquartered his command in New Bern during the fall of 1775 and was charged by the Provincial Congress with protecting the northern half of North Carolina up to the border with Virginia. At the time, British forces under the command of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, the last Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, were ravaging the tidewater region of Virginia. Howe, of his own initiative, brought his North Carolina troops into Virginia, arriving shortly after the Battle of Great Bridge. Howe then directed the occupation of Norfolk, Virginia, which had recently been abandoned by Loyalist forces, and assumed command of the various North Carolina and Virginia units there. The region around Norfolk was being occupied by Loyalist militia units under Dunmore&#x27;s command.

Howe, as senior officer chosen over the more junior William Woodford of Virginia, engaged in contentious negotiations over access to supplies with the captains of British ships anchored off Norfolk, which were by that time overcrowded with Loyalist refugees. The situation deteriorated, and Norfolk was burned on January 1, 1776, in an action started by British marines and a bombardment by Royal Navy vessels and completed by Patriot forces. The fire raged on for two more days, and Howe ordered most of the buildings that remained standing to be razed before he withdrew, to further render the location useless to the British. During Howe&#x27;s time in command at Norfolk, Woodford described the North Carolinian as a &quot;brave, prudent &amp; spirited commander&quot;. On December 22, 1775, Howe was formally thanked by the Virginia Convention, and on April 27, 1776, he received the same honor from the Fourth North Carolina Provincial Congress.

===Charleston, 1776–1777===
In March 1776, Howe was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by the Second Continental Congress along with fellow North Carolinian James Moore. Howe and Moore were two of five North Carolinians to be given a general&#x27;s commission in the Continental Army. Initially, Howe was given command of all Continental forces in Virginia, but soon both he and Moore were ordered to South Carolina. Howe arrived first, as the presence of the British Army and Royal Navy under the command of General Henry Clinton at the mouth of the Cape Fear River delayed Moore&#x27;s descent. When Clinton arrived off the coast of North Carolina, he issued a proclamation offering a pardon to anyone who had taken up arms against the crown with the explicit exception of Howe and fellow revolutionary Cornelius Harnett, then serving as president of the North Carolina Provincial Council, the executive body in the revolutionary state. Howe&#x27;s plantation, Kendal, was sacked by the British during their maneuvers around Wilmington.

Upon arriving in Charleston, Howe acted as an adjutant to Major General Charles Lee, who had been appointed Commander of the Southern Department of the Continental Army. Howe directly commanded the South Carolina militia during the First Siege of Charleston in June 1776 and was assigned command over the defenses of the city proper. Lee was recalled to the North to assist General George Washington, and in his absence, James Moore was appointed Commander of the Southern Department. Howe was left in command of Charleston and Savannah, Georgia in Lee&#x27;s absence, and in September 1776, he became embroiled in a controversy involving the provincial assembly of South Carolina allowing its officers to recruit soldiers from North Carolina&#x27;s continental line units. Howe pleaded with the Provincial Congress of North Carolina to allow South Carolina to recruit within the former state&#x27;s borders because of the greater number of white males in that state. Eventually, North Carolina acceded to that request but only after ordering Howe to reclaim the North Carolinians who had already been lured away by the South Carolinians. The South Carolina Council took offense and demanded that Howe pay the recruitment bonuses for the men if he wished to have them back. With James Moore&#x27;s death on April 15, 1777, Howe assumed command of the Southern Department.

===Florida and political conflict 1777–1778===
Howe&#x27;s style of command was quick to cause discontent, and on August 20, 1777, the South Carolina Assembly protested against Howe&#x27;s right to command soldiers within the borders of South Carolina. He was nonetheless promoted to the rank of major general on October 20, 1777, the only North Carolinian to reach that rank in the Continental Army. Howe often deferred to the civil leadership of the various states that made up his command, often referring conflicts with state officials to the Continental Congress to resolve. Of particular note was an early conflict with Georgia&#x27;s state government, which insisted that the governor of that state retain command of the state&#x27;s militia during military engagements. When asked for an official opinion, Congress sided with Howe, who believed that command of the militia should be relinquished to him during such engagements. Complicating matters, however, was the fact that Congressional funding for military expenditures was given over to the states rather than the army officers, forcing Howe to rely on state governments for funding.

In 1778, he was ordered to act on a plan developed by General Charles Lee to assault British West Florida – a plan that Howe disfavored. A previous expedition in 1777, in which Howe did not directly participate, had ended quickly in failure. Congress overrode Howe&#x27;s concerns about the expedition and directed him to proceed in conjunction with Georgia&#x27;s militia into Florida. The combined Army&#x27;s progress into Florida was made slow by a lack of provisions and particularly by a lack of slaves who Howe requested be made available to build roads and perform pioneering functions for the march southward.

On June 29, 1778, Howe captured Fort Tonyn on the St. Marys River, which forms a portion of the border between Georgia and Florida. Georgia Governor John Houstoun refused to give up command of his militia to the Continental Army general and declined to participate in Howe&#x27;s council. To make matters worse, when South Carolina militia units arrived in Georgia under the command of Colonel Andrew Williamson, their commander also refused to allow Howe to command that state&#x27;s militia units. Shortly after this minor incursion, the British received reinforcements and pressed toward Savannah. By July 14, 1778, Howe was forced to pull his units back north and returned to Charleston. The general received much of the blame for the expedition&#x27;s failure, as Georgia officials were quick to cast aspersions on the Continental command, which was compounded by Congress&#x27; failure to understand Howe&#x27;s inability to control the Georgia militia despite their prior determination of his command authority over militia units.
===Duel with Christopher Gadsden, 1778===
Howe&#x27;s squabbles with local political and militia leaders were not his sole difficulties. On August 30, 1778, Howe engaged in a pistol duel with Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina over an offense Gadsden perceived stemming from his resignation in 1777 while under Howe&#x27;s command. This controversy, like many in which Howe was involved, centered on the conflict between the Continental Army and state governments&#x27; desires to retain local control over their officers and soldiers. Gadsden responded to the perceived offense by drafting and circulating a letter attacking Howe&#x27;s intelligence and ability as a commander and questioning Howe&#x27;s legal authority to issue orders to South Carolina Continentals. Howe took offense and demanded satisfaction from Gadsden on August 17, 1778.

During the duel, Colonel Charles Pinckney, father of South Carolina Governor Charles Pinckney, served as Howe&#x27;s second, while Colonel Barnard Elliot served as second to Gadsden. Howe, shooting first, missed his shot at eight paces, although the ball grazed Gadsden&#x27;s ear. Gadsden then intentionally fired above his own left shoulder and demanded Howe fire again, a demand Howe refused. At the conclusion of the duel, the participants made amends and parted ways. The affair did not end privately, as the &quot;South Carolinian and American Gazette&quot; published a full story covering the duel on September 3, 1778, and in the same month, the ill-fated Major John André, the British officer who would later serve as a facilitator for Benedict Arnold&#x27;s change of allegiance, published an 18-stanza satirical poem about the duel set to the tune of Yankee Doodle.

===Removal from command and the Battle of Savannah, 1778===

After allegations circulated in South Carolina about Howe&#x27;s dalliances with a woman, the Continental Congress finally removed him from command of the Southern Department on September 25, 1778, replacing him with Major General Benjamin Lincoln. Howe remained with the Southern army and commanded it from Savannah. While awaiting Lincoln&#x27;s arrival in Savannah with reinforcements, Howe set up defenses around that city, preparing for an imminent attack. Governor Houstoun sparred again with Howe, refusing to grant him more than meager militia support.

During the First Battle of Savannah on December 29, 1778, the British landed near the city, and under the command of Archibald Campbell, managed to flank Howe&#x27;s army, which was drawn up in the open for battle, by taking a path through a marshy area Howe believed was impassable. Howe had previously ordered a scout to look for any paths through the swamp, but Campbell&#x27;s route, which was shown to the British commander by a slave, remained unknown to the Patriots. Howe&#x27;s position was otherwise strong and defensible, but the appearance of the British in the Patriot rear caused a panic. The militia under Howe&#x27;s command fled instantly, and more than 500 Patriots and Continental Army soldiers were killed or captured. The ensuing defeat gave Savannah to the British, for which Howe received much blame. On January 3, 1779, Howe formally relinquished his command to Lincoln.

Howe&#x27;s failure at Savannah led to criticism from Georgia state officials, who believed he had abandoned the state to the British, as well as from fellow Continental Army generals, such as William Moultrie, who criticized Howe for even attempting to resist the British while being so greatly outnumbered. During his testimony before a later court–martial, Howe claimed that he knew about the pathway through the swamp taken by the British, but stated that he did not defend it because he believed the chance of an attack along the path was &quot;so remote&quot;. This contradicted earlier testimony from Georgia militia officer George Walton, who stated that Howe did not know about the path prior to the battle and that Howe told Walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through the swamps existed.

===Hudson Valley and Connecticut, 1779===

After Lincoln&#x27;s arrival, Howe was ordered to join the Continental Army in the North, which he rejoined on May 19, 1779. Suffering from injuries caused by a fall, Howe was unable to undertake any duties for a month after his arrival. Initially, Howe was charged with defending Connecticut from British raids, such as those conducted by his former mentor, William Tryon, and Tryon&#x27;s adjutant, Edmund Fanning. Howe&#x27;s headquarters were in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

On June 18, 1779, shortly after the Battle of Stony Point, Howe was ordered to assist General Israel Putnam in assaulting a British fortification at Verplanck&#x27;s Point, which sat across the Hudson River from Stony Point. Howe was charged with commanding the artillery barrage and infantry assault of that position, but was given too few field pieces, entrenching tools, provisions, and little ammunition to make a serious attempt at taking the fortification. He advised Washington that an assault would be unfeasible and called off the siege with Washington&#x27;s consent. Historians have noted that Howe&#x27;s inability to take the British fortifications damaged his career and that he was never again given a major command. Contemporaries such as General William Irvine criticized Howe as &quot;having a &quot;talent&quot; ... of finding many supposed obstructions, and barely plausible pretences for his delay&quot; in assaulting Verplanck&#x27;s Point.

After Stony Point, Howe was assigned first to the command of the left wing of Washington&#x27;s army composed of Massachusetts brigades under Generals John Nixon and John Glover, with his command again in Ridgefield, Connecticut. While military action was infrequent in Howe&#x27;s region of control, he was integral in the recruitment and cultivation of a substantial spy network which provided the Patriots with information about British positions on Manhattan and along the Long Island Sound.

===West Point and Benedict Arnold conspiracy, 1779–1780===
As part of his command duties, Howe was chosen by Washington as president of the court–martial convened to determine the propriety of General Benedict Arnold&#x27;s conduct while serving as the commandant of Philadelphia in 1778 and 1779. During that time, Arnold was alleged to have conducted business with British merchants and to have undertaken private business transactions that were inappropriate given his position, among other improprieties. The tribunal, which met at Howe&#x27;s headquarters in Middletown, Connecticut, adjourned for several months due to a threatened British attack but reconvened in December 1779 and closed in January 1780. During the interlude in the fall of 1779, Howe was ordered by Washington to move into position to attack the British in conjunction with an expected combined French naval and land-based assault, although the French assault in New York never materialized. The court-martial rendered its decision on January 26, 1780, finding Arnold guilty of breaching the articles of war by permitting a vessel from an enemy port into Philadelphia and recommended that he be reprimanded by Washington.

Howe was made commandant of the Continental Army fortifications at West Point on February 21, 1780. He held that command immediately prior to Benedict Arnold&#x27;s conspiracy to turn over control of that stronghold to the British. Arnold and several supporters in Congress had eventually convinced Washington to give him command of the fortifications on August 3, 1780. Howe remained active in the upper Hudson River valley during the remainder of the war, particularly in overseeing his network of spies in the area, including double agent Joshua Hett Smith, who would later play a key role in Arnold&#x27;s treason and prosecution. During this time, evidence arose implicating Howe in discussions with the British, though the evidence was dismissed by Washington as merely rumors stirred up by British General Henry Clinton. Howe served on the court-martial board that convicted of espionage and sentenced to death Major John André, the British officer tasked with facilitating Arnold&#x27;s conspiracy.

===Pennsylvania mutinies and war&#x27;s end, 1781–1783===
In 1781, Howe assisted in putting down the Pompton Mutiny in New Jersey, which was inspired by the slightly earlier Pennsylvania Line Mutiny. Washington ordered Howe to surround the camp and arrange for the court-martial and execution of two of its ringleaders. In the fall of 1781, Howe requested permission to go with Washington to Virginia for what was anticipated to be the final campaign against the British, but Washington refused. Instead, Howe was required to appear before a court–martial in Philadelphia which was opened to inquire into Howe&#x27;s actions in the defense of Savannah in 1778. The tribunal, led by Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, opened on December 7, 1781, and closed on January 23, 1782, acquitting Howe of any wrongdoing at Savannah with &quot;the Highest Honor&quot;. Assistant Adjutant General John Carlisle ordered Howe to convene a court–martial to investigate the conduct of General Alexander McDougall in the spring of 1782. McDougall was a personal friend of Howe&#x27;s, but the tribunal convicted him of the minor offense of releasing confidential details from a council of war meeting in 1776 to persons who were not permitted to have such information. Again in 1783, Howe was called on to put down the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, which had caused the Continental Congress to flee Philadelphia.

==Post-war career and death==
After putting down the second Pennsylvania mutiny in 1783, Howe participated in the establishment of the Society of the Cincinnati and was the second officer to sign the national charter, with his signature appearing directly below that of von Steuben. Howe thereafter returned to his North Carolina plantation, Kendal, which was upriver from the more famous Orton Plantation owned by Howe&#x27;s distant relatives. Also in 1783, Howe became a founding member of the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati and was a signatory to its &quot;Institution&quot; or charter. During much of 1783 and 1784, Howe returned frequently to Philadelphia, New York, and other cities in the northeast in an attempt to settle accounts and obtain back payments he claimed he was owed by Congress. He was again forced to mortgage his plantation but eventually received a monetary settlement from Congress of $7,000 in 1785.

During 1785, Howe was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation to establish treaties with several western Indian tribes but did not actually travel with commissioners George Rogers Clark, Richard Butler, and Samuel Holden Parsons, who finalized the Treaty of Fort Finney without Howe in 1786. Howe assisted Benjamin Smith in planning for the construction of Bald Head Light and actively worked to assist former Loyalists who sought to return to their prior lives in North Carolina by defending them against the judiciary of the state.

In the summer of 1786, he was elected a member of the North Carolina House of Commons. On his way to a meeting of the legislative body, Howe fell ill, and died on December 14, 1786, in Bladen County. Howe&#x27;s remains were buried on property he owned in what later became Columbus County, North Carolina, although the exact location of his burial has not been discovered. A cenotaph was placed in Southport&#x27;s Old Smithville Burying Ground honoring him and wife Sara.

==Legacy==
Howe has been remembered primarily in a negative light based on his lack of military successes and reputation, although North Carolina historian Hugh Rankin noted in a biographical sketch that &quot;his opportunities came at times when he did not have proper field strength to gain favorable recognition.&quot; During the 1903 session of the United States House of Representatives, Congressman John Dillard Bellamy introduced a bill to erect an equestrian statue of Howe in Wilmington in order to commemorate the general&#x27;s service; this bill was not passed. In 1940, the State of North Carolina cast and erected a highway historical marker to commemorate Howe&#x27;s service. The marker stands on North Carolina Highway 133 in Belville, North Carolina. The 1955 film &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot; featured a performance by actor John McIntire as Howe during the height of the Benedict Arnold conspiracy.

===Evidence of attempted treason===
Several scholars have raised questions regarding Howe&#x27;s actions as the unofficial spymaster of the Hudson Valley, all of which center on evidence that suggests Howe attempted to bargain with the British in exchange for a commission as an officer in the regular British Army, similar to the bargain struck by Benedict Arnold in 1780. As early as 1776, after Howe was appointed a brigadier general, a Loyalist merchant named Henry Kelly advised Secretary of State for the Colonies George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville that Howe could be easily tempted to join the British, and further claimed that Howe could offer a great deal to the British in their war effort.

In 1780, after Benedict Arnold&#x27;s attempted treason had been exposed, Captain Beesly Edgar Joel, a British defector and former officer in the British Army, claimed that another officer besides Arnold had attempted to defect, and after interrogation Joel named Howe as that officer. Joel cited Edmund Fanning, William Tryon&#x27;s secretary, as the source for his information. Joel further described Howe&#x27;s method of communicating with the British, which was by means of a frequently imprisoned-and-exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between the parties. While neither Washington or the Congressional Board of War believed Joel&#x27;s story due to their suspicion of Joel as a British spy, Joel was later commissioned by Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia government to lead a Patriot militia unit against Loyalists in that state. Furthermore, William Smith, a New York Loyalist and the brother of Howe&#x27;s agent and Arnold&#x27;s co-conspirator Joshua Hett Smith, noted in his diary on April 29, 1780, that his brother, Thomas Smith, had been informed that a commissary had come over to the British with &quot;information&quot; from the Patriots in much the same manner as Joel had described. On September 28, 1780, William Smith told Henry Clinton that he believed &quot;Bob&quot; Howe would be willing to turn on the Patriots.

Later historians, including Douglas Southall Freeman, have frequently dismissed allegations that Howe attempted to defect, believing them to have been fabrications used by Joel to ingratiate himself with the Patriot government. The only full-length book treatment of Howe&#x27;s life discusses the allegations of attempted treason in a single page. On the other hand, Freeman&#x27;s judgment was based primarily on Washington&#x27;s assessment of the allegations, but Washington did not have access to the potentially corroborating evidence in William Smith&#x27;s diary. Another possibility is that Howe had merely attempted to spread word among the British of his possible treason in order to conceal his management of the vast spy network at his control; this tactic was utilized by other spymasters in Continental employ such as Philip Schuyler. Philip Ranlet, an American historian who studied Howe&#x27;s career and motivations, has contrasted Schuyler&#x27;s otherwise shining reputation with Howe&#x27;s record of failures and draws the conclusion that Howe likely was attempting to defect. To date, no firm evidence exists which either absolves Howe or proves him guilty of attempted treason.

<text>The Trophée des Champions (, ) is a French association football trophy contested in an annual match between the champions of Ligue 1 and the winners of the Coupe de France. It is equivalent to the super cups found in many other countries.

==History==
The match, with its current name, was first played in 1995, but the format in French football has existed since 1949 when the 1948–49 first division champions, Stade de Reims, defeated the winners of the 1948–49 edition of the Coupe de France, RCF Paris, 4–3 at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes. The match is co-organized by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) and the Union Syndicale des Journalistes Sportifs de France (UJSF).

From 1955 to 1973, the French Football Federation (FFF) hosted a similar match known as the &quot;Challenge des champions&quot;. The match returned in 1985, but was eliminated after only two seasons due to its unpopularity. In 1995, the FFF officially re-instated the competition under its current name and the inaugural match was contested between Paris Saint-Germain and Nantes in January 1996 at the Stade Francis-Le Blé in Brest. The following season, the match was not played due to Auxerre winning the double. A similar situation occurred in 2008 when Lyon won the double. The match was initially on the brink of cancellation, however, the LFP decided to allow the league runner-up, Bordeaux, to be Lyon&#x27;s opponents. Bordeaux won the match 5–4 on penalties.
The Trophée des Champions match is contested at the beginning or middle of the following season and has been played at a variety of venues. During the &quot;Challenge des Champions&quot; era, the match was in such cities as Marseille, Montpellier, Paris, Toulouse, and Saint-Étienne. From 1995 to 2008, the match was hosted three times at the Stade Gerland in Lyon. Other venues include the Stade Pierre de Coubertin twice in Cannes, the Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg, and the Stade de l&#x27;Abbé Deschamps in Auxerre. 

On 12 May 2009, the FFF announced that the 2009 Trophée des Champions would be played outside France for the first time, at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It has since been held in Tunisia, Morocco, United States, Gabon, China, Austria, and most recently, Qatar. For the 2024 season final in Doha, Paris Saint Germain wore Arabic writing on the team&#x27;s shirts for the first time; the design was created by calligrapher Fatma Al Sharshani.

<text>Manhattan Melodrama is a 1934 American pre-Code crime drama film, produced by MGM, directed by W. S. Van Dyke, and starring Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy. The movie also provided one of Mickey Rooney&#x27;s earliest film roles. (Rooney played Gable&#x27;s character as a child.) The film is based on a story by Arthur Caesar, who won the Academy Award for Best Original Story. It was also the first of Myrna Loy and William Powell&#x27;s fourteen screen pairings.

Notorious criminal John Dillinger attended a showing of the film at Chicago&#x27;s Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. After leaving the theater, he was shot to death by federal agents. Myrna Loy was among those who expressed distaste at the studio&#x27;s willingness to exploit this event for the financial benefit of the film. Scenes from &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot;, in addition to Dillinger&#x27;s death, are depicted in the 2009 film &quot;Public Enemies&quot; starring Johnny Depp as Dillinger.

==Plot==
On June 15, 1904, the steamboat &quot;General Slocum&quot; catches fire and sinks in New York&#x27;s East River. Two boys, Blackie Gallagher (Mickey Rooney) and Jim Wade (Jimmy Butler), are rescued by a priest, Father Joe (Leo Carrillo), but are orphaned by the disaster. They are taken in by another survivor, Poppa Rosen (George Sidney), who lost his young son in the sinking. The boys live with Poppa Rosen for a short while; then Rosen, a Russian Jew, is trampled to death by a policeman&#x27;s horse after he heckles Leon Trotsky at a Communist rally and a melee breaks out.

The boys remain close friends, though their lives diverge. Studious from the very beginning, Jim (played as an adult by William Powell) gets his law degree and eventually becomes the assistant district attorney. Blackie is a cheerful, happy-go-lucky kid who loves to throw dice and trick other kids out of their money. Played as an adult by Clark Gable, he becomes the owner of a fancy, albeit illegal, casino. Though regularly &quot;raided&quot;, the cops have been paid off and the casino resumes business immediately after they leave. Blackie&#x27;s girlfriend Eleanor (Myrna Loy) loves him, but pleads with him in vain to marry her and give up his dangerous life.

Jim is elected district attorney. Blackie, always a supporter and admirer of Jim, knowing the latter&#x27;s incorruptibility, arranges to meet him for a celebration, but something comes up, and he sends Eleanor to keep Jim company at the Cotton Club until he can join them. Jim and Eleanor talk the night away. Afterward, she gives Blackie one last chance to marry her and settle down. When Blackie refuses, she leaves him.

Months later, Jim and Eleanor meet by chance and start keeping company (she informs Jim that she has not seen Blackie for months). Meanwhile, Blackie, who acknowledges that he is a changed man (due to Eleanor&#x27;s having left him), coldly kills Manny Arnold (Noel Madison) for not paying his gambling debts. Jim summons him to his office, where he tells him that he and Eleanor are going to get married. Blackie is sincerely happy for both of them. Jim also informs his friend that he is a suspect in the Arnold murder. However, there is no real evidence, so the crime goes unsolved.

Jim invites him to be the best man at his wedding. Blackie initially accepts but later sends a telegram begging off. After returning from his honeymoon, Jim runs for governor of New York. Snow (Thomas E. Jackson), who had been his chief assistant until Jim fired him for corruption, threatens to tell reporters that Jim covered up for Blackie in the Arnold case. Although untrue, this would cost Jim a close race for the governorship. By chance, Blackie and Eleanor meet at the horse track. Eleanor tells Blackie about Snow. Blackie shoots Snow dead in a washroom of Madison Square Garden during a hockey game. A beggar who pretends to be blind sees him leave the scene of the crime. Jim has no choice but to prosecute Blackie. Blackie is convicted and sentenced to death.

Jim wins the election, partly because the public sees that he is so honest he is prosecuting his own childhood friend. He is sworn in, and at a hearing regarding commutation of the sentence, he denies the application, stating that the voters have a right to expect that he not ever be &quot;corrupted by money, influence, or even by my own personal feelings.&quot; Eleanor tries to get him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, revealing Blackie&#x27;s motive for killing Snow, but that only makes things worse. When Jim remains steadfast, Eleanor leaves him. At the last moment, Jim hurries to Sing Sing Prison and meets Blackie, together with Father Joe, who is now the prison&#x27;s chaplain. Jim finally offers to commute the death sentence, but Blackie turns him down, admitting to the murder of Manny Arnold. He then says he doesn&#x27;t want Jim to ruin his own career so Blackie can &quot;rot in this hole&quot; for the rest of his life. Father Joe leads Blackie to the electric chair while saying last rites.

A few days later, Jim calls a special joint session of the New York Legislature. He reveals how the murder helped him win the election, and how at the end he compromised his principles and was willing to commute his friend&#x27;s sentence. He then tenders his resignation. When he leaves, Eleanor is waiting for him. She tells him that she was wrong about him, and they leave together to start a new life.

Cast notes
* &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; was the only film that Clark Gable and William Powell made together, but both men were married to Carole Lombard. Lombard was married to Powell when she made her only film with Clark Gable, &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot;.

==Reception==
Filmed relatively quickly and with a modest budget, &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; was expected to return a profit but not to capture the imagination of the public. The picture&#x27;s smash hit success surprised the studio and made major stars of screen veterans Myrna Loy and William Powell in the first of their fourteen screen pairings, and also solidified the success of MGM&#x27;s most popular male lead, Clark Gable. The film has a Harlem nightclub scene featuring Shirley Ross in blackface singing a song called &quot;The Bad in Every Man.&quot; After the film&#x27;s release, the lyrics were rewritten by Lorenz Hart as the retitled &quot;Blue Moon&quot;. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% with an average rating of 7.04/10, based on 15 contemporary reviews.

According to MGM records, the film earned $735,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $498,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $415,000.

==Radio adaptation==
&quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; was presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on September 9, 1940. William Powell, Myrna Loy and Don Ameche starred in the adaptation.

<text>Charles Leslie (27 July 1650 – 13 April 1722) was a former Church of Ireland priest who became a leading Jacobite propagandist after the 1688 Glorious Revolution. One of a small number of Irish Protestants to actively support the Stuarts after 1688, he is best remembered today for his role in publicising the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe.

==Life==

Charles Leslie was the sixth son and one of eight surviving children of John Leslie (1571–1671) and Katherine Conyngham (or Cunningham), daughter of Dr. Alexander Cunningham, Dean of Raphoe. John was originally from Stuartfield or Crichie, in Scotland; from 1628–1633, he was bishop of the Isles, a diocese in the Church of Scotland and a member of the Scottish Privy Council. In 1633, he moved to Ireland and appointed Church of Ireland bishop of Raphoe, then bishop Clogher from 1661 until his death in 1671.

Born on 27 July 1650 in Dublin, Charles was allegedly named after the executed Charles I and educated at Enniskillen school and Trinity College, Dublin. After his father died at the age of 100 in 1671, he studied law in London before changing career and being ordained as an Anglican priest in 1681. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the family estate at Glaslough in County Monaghan and married Jane Griffith; they had a daughter, Jane, nicknamed &quot;Vinegar Jane&quot; who married Reverend James Hamilton, and two sons, Robert (nicknamed &quot;Mad Robin&quot;) (1683–1744) and Henry (nicknamed &quot;Harry the Spaniard&quot;) who were also Jacobites and spent time in exile. They both eventually returned to Ireland and were friendly with Jonathan Swift, who had known their father.

==Career==
Charles was appointed assistant curate for the Church of Ireland parish of Donagh but &quot;...as most of his parish was Roman Catholic or Presbyterian, he had few duties.&quot; John Leslie had been chaplain to Charles I and a key supporter of Caroline religious reforms, first in Scotland, then in Ireland as Bishop of Raphoe in 1633, while the estate at Glaslough was granted by Charles II in 1660 as a reward for his service. With this background, Charles was a firm supporter of the Stuart dynasty, although deeply hostile to Catholicism, and soon became involved in political and theological disputes. 

When the Catholic James II became King in 1685, his brother-in-law Henry Hyde, Earl of Clarendon was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; in July 1686, Leslie&#x27;s legal training resulted in Clarendon making him chancellor of Connor cathedral and later Justice of the Peace. Clarendon&#x27;s authority was overshadowed by his Catholic deputy Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, who began undermining legal restrictions on Catholics embodied in the Test Act. Clarendon employed Leslie&#x27;s polemical skills to oppose the appointment of Catholics to public office but he was recalled in 1687; when James was deposed by the Glorious Revolution in December 1688, Leslie was in the Isle of Wight.

Shortly afterwards, he became Clarendon&#x27;s personal chaplain and like his patron refused to take the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II. Like other Non-Jurors, he was deprived of his Church offices and became instead one of the most prominent Jacobite and Tory propagandists; this included a long dispute with his Trinity College contemporary William King, who supported the Revolution. Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury later named him &quot;the violentest Jacobite&quot; active in England during these years. He spent the next twenty years writing various controversial pamphlets in favour of the nonjuring cause, and numerous polemics against Quakers, Jews, Socinians, and Deists as well as Catholics.

Much of his early writing focused on Scotland, where the 1690 Settlement ended Episcopacy and restored a Presbyterian kirk; Leslie used this to inspire concern about William&#x27;s intentions towards the Church of England. Ironically, his modern fame now rests primarily on a pamphlet written in 1695, called &quot;Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &amp;c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe, Gaffney.&quot; The focus of this was William&#x27;s alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Dutch Republican leader Johan de Witt, with other crimes including Glencoe included as secondary charges. During the 1745 Rising, Charles Stuart ordered Leslie&#x27;s pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes of the investigation to be reprinted in the Edinburgh &quot;Caledonian Mercury.&quot;

During the 1690s, he served as a messenger between James&#x27; court in exile at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Non-Juror community in England, including the Non-Juror bishops Jeremy Collier, Thomas Ken and George Hickes. Leslie defended Collier and two other Non-Juror priests when they became involved in a furore over the execution of Sir John Friend and Sir William Parkyns, for their role in the 1696 Jacobite plot to assassinate William. Immediately prior to the execution, the clergymen declared the two absolved of their sins, effectively declaring the correctness of their actions, whilst also performing a rite not recognised by the Church of England.

In 1702, the accession of Queen Anne, the last Stuart monarch, caused a resurgence in Jacobite activity and in 1704, Leslie began a weekly periodical initially called &quot;The Observator,&quot; later &quot;The Rehearsal of Observator&quot; and finally &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;. Although his Tory readership shared his High Church principles, Leslie was primarily a Jacobite and violently opposed the common practice of &quot;occasional conformity.&quot; &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; was forced to close in 1709 and he fell out with his former allies, including Henry Sacheverell whose trial helped the Tories win a landslide victory in the 1710 General election.

Despite his Tory allies now being in government, a warrant was issued for Leslie&#x27;s arrest for his tract &quot;The Good Old Cause, or, Lying in Truth;&quot; in 1711 he escaped to Paris, where James Francis Edward had succeeded his father as the Stuart heir in 1701. He continued to write polemics and act as a Jacobite agent; however, after the failed 1715 Rebellion, France withdrew support for the Stuarts who were forced to leave France, eventually being invited to settle in Rome by Pope Benedict XIV. The Spanish-sponsored 1719 Rising in Scotland was judged to have done more damage to the Jacobite cause than otherwise, one of its leaders concluding &quot;it bid fair to ruin the King&#x27;s Interest and faithful subjects in these parts&quot;.

Despite these failures, Leslie remained a dedicated Jacobite but his lifelong antipathy towards Catholicism made living in Rome as a Papal pensionary difficult, while hopes of converting James to Anglicanism faded due to his devout personal Catholicism. He returned to Paris in 1717 and in 1719 published a two folio-volume edition of his &quot;Theological Works;&quot; it was later claimed these placed him &quot;very high in the list of controversial authors, the ingenuity of the arguments being equalled only by the keenest and pertinacity with which they are pursued.&quot; He invited friends and supporters to subscribe to these and by 1721, over 500 members of the House of Lords and House of Commons had pledged a total of £750. The Earl of Sunderland finally allowed him to return home, with the stipulation he cease his political activities.

Charles Leslie died at Glaslough on 13 April 1722; his grandchildren included Charles Leslie MP, whose son, in turn, was John Leslie, Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.

==Works==

In addition to his &quot;Theological Works,&quot; Leslie produced over 81 publications, &quot;...not counting 397 issues of his periodical, The Rehearsal (1704–1709) and represented one of the most significant ideological challenges to the post-Revolution establishment.&quot; He wrote on a wide spectrum of topics, including a detailed criticism of John Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost.

Some of his ideas were employed by 18th-century conservative writers like John Hutchinson; the rise of the Oxford Movement in the early 19th century led to the reprint of his &quot;Theological Works&quot; in the 1830s, Henry Newman one of those to reference them. Critics including Samuel Johnson and Thomas Macaulay viewed his style as more memorable than the ideas, while for modern commentators, he was defending a political ideology that bore little relationship to reality.

Leslie&#x27;s polemical writing on Scotland had a greater impact and endured far longer than often appreciated. After 1745, the Glencoe Massacre faded from public view until 1859, when it re-appeared in Macaulay&#x27;s History; his aim was to exonerate William of every charge made by Leslie, including the Massacre and he is the origin of the claim it was part of a Campbell-MacDonald feud. Instead, Macaulay made the Massacre more widely known while it is also argued Leslie&#x27;s perspectives continue to shape views of William&#x27;s reign as particularly disastrous for Scotland, with Glencoe one of a series of incidents like the Darien scheme, the famine of the late 1690s and the 1707 Union.

<doc id="691314" wikidata="Q1568142" url="?curid=691314" title="Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Chief of the General Staff (CGS) has been the title of the professional head of the British Army since 1964. The CGS is a member of both the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Army Board; he is also the Chair of the Executive Committee of the Army Board. Prior to 1964, the title was Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). Since 1959, the post has been immediately subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Staff, the post held by the professional head of the British Armed Forces.

The current Chief of the General Staff is General Sir Roland Walker, who succeeded General Sir Patrick Sanders in the role on 15 June 2024.

==Responsibilities==
The Chief of the General Staff (CGS) is the professional head of the Army, with responsibility for developing and generating military capability from an integrated Army (Regular and Reserve) and for maintaining the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the Service. The CGS reports to the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) and, as a Service COS, has a right of direct access to the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister. The CGS is a member of the Defence Council and the Army Board, the Armed Forces Committee, the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Senior Appointments Committee. Responsibile for:

* Maintains the institutional health of the Army by exercising Full Command responsibility for all Army personnel
* Ensures the efficient and effective governance of the service
* Chairs the Executive Committee of the Army Board and the Army Command Group
* Contributes to the conduct of defence higher level business, with a particular responsibility for providing specialist advice on Army matters
* Develops future Army capability within the context of Defence strategic direction and resource allocation
* Leads the senior management team of the British Army

==Background==
The title was also used for five years between the demise of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1904 and the introduction of Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1909. The post was then held by General Sir Neville Lyttelton and, briefly, by Field Marshal Sir William Nicholson.

Throughout the existence of the post the Chief of the General Staff has been the First Military Member of the Army Board.

==Roles==
The Chief was responsible for commanding the entire British Army. During the Second World War, General Brooke focused on grand strategy, and his relationships, through the Combined Chiefs of Staff with his American counterparts. He was also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of senior commanders, allocation of manpower and equipment, and the organisation of tactical air forces in support of land operations of field commanders; he also had primary responsibility for supervising the military operations of the Free French, Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and Czech units reporting to their governments in exile in London. Brooke vigorously allocated responsibilities to his deputies, and despite the traditional historical distrust that had existed between the military and the political side of the War Office, he got along quite well with his counterpart, the Secretary of State for War, first David Margesson and later, Sir James Grigg.

<doc id="691322" wikidata="Q7051448" url="?curid=691322" title="Norm Cash">
<text>Norman Dalton Cash (November 10, 1933 – October 11, 1986) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman who spent almost his entire career with the Detroit Tigers. A power hitter, his 377 career home runs were the fourth most by an American League left-handed hitter when he retired, behind Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Lou Gehrig; his 373 home runs with the Tigers is tied for second in franchise history with Miguel Cabrera, behind Al Kaline (399). He also led the AL in assists three times and fielding percentage twice; he ranked among the all-time leaders in assists (4th with 1,317) and double plays (10th with 1,347) upon his retirement, and was fifth in AL history in games at first base (1,943). He was known to fans and teammates during his playing days as &quot;Stormin&#x27; Norman.&quot;

==Early life==
Cash was born in Justiceburg, Garza County, Texas, and attended (what was then) Sul Ross State Teachers College, where he was All-Lone Star Conference in football as well as playing baseball; he was drafted by the Chicago Bears as a running back in 1955, but declined to play pro football.

==MLB career==
Detroit Tigers

After signing with the Chicago White Sox in 1955, he spent 1957 in the military and made his debut with the team in , seeing limited play as an outfielder and pinch hitter. He appeared in 58 games for the AL pennant-winners; the August 25 acquisition of Ted Kluszewski left him on the White Sox bench. He was hitless in four pinch-hitting appearances in the World Series. In December of that year, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in an eight-player deal that brought Minnie Miñoso back to Chicago, but the Indians general manager Frank Lane traded Cash to Detroit for Steve Demeter, who would play only four more games; both Chicago and Cleveland were haunted by Cash for the next 15 years, as he won a batting title in 1961 and a World Series ring in 1968 wearing a Detroit uniform.

=== Detroit Tigers ===
Cash filled the middle of the Tigers lineup for 15 seasons as part of one of the sport&#x27;s top offenses.

In 1960, Cash grounded into no double plays, the first American League player with at least 400 plate appearances in a season to accomplish that since league records on this stat were started in 1940.

Cash enjoyed a breakout season in , one of the most unlikely by any player in major league history. Even though the veteran had never hit higher than .286 above the B level in three previous seasons, he led the AL with a .361 average, 41 home runs (sixth in the AL), 132 runs batted in (fourth), 119 runs scored (fourth), 124 walks (second) for a .487 on-base percentage (first), and 354 total bases (second) for a .662 slugging average (second); but his season was overshadowed by the 61 home runs of Roger Maris, and teammate Rocky Colavito finished with more home runs and RBI. Still, his .361 average would be the highest by any major league player in the 1960s, and would not be topped by another Tiger until Magglio Ordóñez hit .363 in 2007. The Tigers finished 101–61 for their best regular-season record since 1934, and scored the most runs in baseball, though they finished second in the AL, eight games behind the New York Yankees; Cash was fourth in the MVP voting.

In future years, Cash openly admitted to using an illegal corked bat during the 1961 season among others. He drilled a hole in his bats and filled it with a mixture of sawdust, cork and glue, an art that was taught to him in the minor leagues. (Studies done many years later concluded that corked bats provided little-to-no benefit except to serve as a significant psychological boost for their users.) His 1961 statistics turned out to be career highs which he did not come close to approaching again — in later years, he never reached 100 runs or 100 RBI, and never batted above .283. His 118-point drop to a .243 average in was the largest ever by a batting champion.

Cash later said of the 1961 season: &quot;It was a freak. Even at the time, I realized that. Everything I hit seemed to drop in, even when I didn&#x27;t make good contact. I never thought I&#x27;d do it again.&quot;

Pitcher Mickey Lolich once asked Cash why he never hit for a high average after that season. &quot;He told me, &#x27;Jim Campbell pays me to hit home runs,&#x27;&quot; said Lolich, referring to the team&#x27;s general manager in those years. &quot;Norm then said, &#x27;I can get hits if I want to, just watch tomorrow.&#x27; The next day he went 3-for-4.&quot;

On June 11, 1961, Cash became the first Detroit Tiger to hit a home run ball out of Tiger Stadium. Cash hit the ball over Tiger Stadium&#x27;s right-field roof four times in his career.

On June 27, 1963, he played an entire game at first base without a defensive chance, as the Minnesota Twins won 10–6.

On his own team, Cash was overshadowed by his future Hall-of-Fame roommate Al Kaline. While his batting average fell off sharply after 1961, Cash hit 30 or more homers four more times, and hit at least 20 in ten of the next eleven seasons. He was the only American League player to hit at least 20 home runs every season from 1961 to 1969. He also finished second in the league in home runs three times (behind Harmon Killebrew in 1962, Tony Conigliaro in 1965, and Bill Melton in 1971), with the Tigers finishing among the AL&#x27;s top three scoring teams every year from 1961 through 1968.

Cash was also considered one of the better defensive first basemen of the 1960s, leading the league in putouts (1961), fielding percentage (1964, 1967) and assists (1965–67).

In the 1968 World Series, Cash hit .385 (10-26) with one home run. With two out in the seventh inning of Game 7, Cash singled off Bob Gibson to start a three-run rally that broke a scoreless tie and propelled the team to its first title since 1945. He also hit a home run to give Detroit a 1–0 lead in Game 1 of the 1972 American League Championship Series, though the Tigers went on to lose the game and the series.

He was released by the Tigers in August after hitting .228 in 53 games.

===Relationship with fans and players===
Apart from his batting accomplishments, Cash was a favorite with his teammates, the media, and Tiger fans. He was known for his hard living and his sense of humor.

On July 15, 1973, as Nolan Ryan was working on his second career no-hitter, Cash went to the plate with two outs in the bottom of the ninth (after striking out his previous three at-bats), holding a table leg from the clubhouse instead of a regulation bat. The stunt drew immediate action by home plate umpire Ron Luciano, who ordered Cash to use a legal bat (though the announcers of the game reported that Luciano was amused by the attempt). Cash popped out using a regulation bat to end the game. 

Teammate Jim Northrup told the story as follows: &quot;In his last at-bat, Norm walked up to the plate with a table leg from the locker room. The plate umpire, Ron Luciano, says, `You can&#x27;t use that up here.&#x27; Cash says, `Why not, I won&#x27;t hit him anyway.&#x27; He then gets a bat, then hit a popup to shortstop to end the game. As he was walking away he says to Luciano, `See, I told ya.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;When you mention Norm Cash, I just smile&quot;, said Al Kaline, who had a locker adjacent to Cash&#x27;s for years. &quot;He was just a fun guy to be around and a great teammate. He always came ready to play.&quot;

Once Cash was trapped between first and second base about to be tagged out. He stopped in his tracks and formed a &quot;T&quot; with his hands to call time-out. There was also a time when Cash missed a foul ball in the stands, turned a little boy&#x27;s cap around, stuck his hand into the young fan&#x27;s popcorn box and said, &quot;Thanks, kid&quot;, as the boy looked up in bewilderment.

One trick Cash frequently tried, occurred when play resumed after a rain delay, Northrup recalled. &quot;If Norman was on second before the rain delay, he would go to third&quot;, Northrup said. &quot;If he was on first, he would go to second.&quot; Northrup said: &quot;Norm had more fun than anybody.&quot;

Cash was also noted for never wearing a batting helmet during his major league career, being one of the few veteran players who was permitted not to do so after helmets were mandated in . Protective liners, however, were required to be worn inside their caps.

====Career statistics====
Cash was a career .271 hitter with 377 home runs, 1104 RBI, 1046 runs, 1820 hits, 241 doubles, 41 triples, 43 stolen bases, a .374 on-base percentage, and a .488 slugging average in 2089 games. He holds Tigers career defensive records at first base in games (1912), putouts (14,926), assists (1303), and double plays (1328), having broken the marks set by Hank Greenberg and Rudy York. He had a .992 fielding percentage at first base in his career. Cash is one of eight players in Tigers history (with Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, Charlie Gehringer, Al Kaline, Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell and Miguel Cabrera) to have played at least 2,000 regular season games with the team.

Cash summed up his success as follows: &quot;I owe my success to expansion pitching, a short right-field fence, and my hollow bats.&quot; Later in his career, Cash claimed he used a corked bat in 1961, even showing &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; how he made one.

===Caribbean baseball===
In between, Cash played winter ball with the Indios de Oriente club of the Venezuelan League during the 1958–59 season. As the league champions, the Indios represented Venezuela in the 1959 Caribbean Series, as Cash posted a .360 average (9-for-25) and led the tournament in home runs (2), RBI (11) and slugging (.680), while driving in six runs in a game — also a Series record — and earning MVP honors.

==Later life==
After retiring from baseball, Cash signed with the Detroit Caesars, a professional softball team, and played two seasons (1977–1978). The Caesars played in the American Professional Slow Pitch Softball League (APSPL), winning league titles in both seasons with Cash. The team was owned by Mike Ilitch, who would later become the owner of the Detroit Tigers. The Caesars had extensive talent from the amateur softball leagues and both Cash and fellow former-Tiger Jim Northrup played part-time and promotional roles.

Cash was a color commentator for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; in 1976, and for Tiger telecasts on ONTV pay-cable from 1981-1983.

In October 1986, Cash drowned in an accident off Beaver Island in northern Lake Michigan when he slipped off a dock and struck his head. His body was discovered about 11:00am in of water at Beaver Island. An autopsy later revealed that Cash had a blood alcohol content of 0.18 percent at the time of his death. He is buried in Pine Lake Cemetery, West Bloomfield, Michigan.

On April 23, 2005, the high school and Little League baseball field in Post, Texas were dedicated to Cash. He was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

<text>Mývatn () is a shallow lake situated in an area of active volcanism in the north of Iceland, near Krafla volcano. It has a high amount of biological activity. The lake and the surrounding wetlands provides a habitat for a number of waterbirds, especially ducks.
The lake was created by a large basaltic lava eruption 2300 years ago, and the surrounding landscape is dominated by volcanic landforms, including lava pillars and rootless vents (pseudocraters). The effluent river Laxá is known for its rich fishing for brown trout and Atlantic salmon.

The name of the lake (Icelandic (&quot;midge&quot;) and (&quot;lake&quot;); &quot;the lake of midges&quot;) comes from the large numbers of midges present in the summer.

The name Mývatn is sometimes used not only for the lake but the whole surrounding inhabited area. The river Laxá, the lake Mývatn and the surrounding wetlands are protected as a nature reserve (the Mývatn–Laxá Nature Conservation Area), which occupies .

Since 2000, a marathon around the lake has taken place in the summer.

==Geography==
The lake has an average depth of 2.5 metres and a maximum depth of 4.5 metres.

===Climate===
The Mývatn area features a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification ET), bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc). Summers are typically cool with crisp nights while winters are very long and cold.

==Flora and fauna==
===Birds===

The lake is fed by nutrient-rich springwater and has a high abundance of aquatic insects (Chironomidae) and Cladocera that form an attractive food supply for ducks. Fifteen species of ducks breed at the site, the largest such number in Europe. The duck species composition has a mixture of European and North American species, and also of boreal and arctic species. Most of the ducks are migratory, arriving in late April to early May from north-western Europe. The commonest species at the lake is the tufted duck with 6,000 pairs present, whilst the second most abundant species is the greater scaup with 1,500 pairs.

Other common species include the Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye, 700 pairs of red-breasted merganser, 1000 pairs of Eurasian wigeon, around 300 pairs of gadwall, 200 pairs of mallard, around 350 pairs of common scoter, 150 pairs of long-tailed duck and 75 pairs of Eurasian teal. The northern shoveler and northern pintail also regularly breed at the lake, albeit in smaller numbers, whilst common pochard used to breed regularly, but they have not done so regularly since the 1950s. The outflowing Laxá river contains around 250 pairs of harlequin duck and there is a large colony of eider at the river mouth some 50 km away from Mývatn. The Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye and the harlequin duck are both nearctic duck species. The population of the Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye (of about 2000 individuals) relies entirely on the habitat provided by the Mývatn Laxá water system and its surrounding lava fields. Most of the Barrow&#x27;s goldeneyes overwinter there, using ice-free areas kept open by emerging spring water (both warm and cold) and in the strong river current. This species is a hole-nester, in North America using tree-holes, but at Mývatn the birds use cavities in the lava for nesting. The other duck species nest abundantly in the numerous islands of the lake and the surrounding marshlands.

Other common waterbirds include the Slavonian grebe, red-necked phalarope, great northern diver, red-throated diver and whooper swan. The lake is included in an important bird area.

Bird populations have been monitored annually since 1975 by the Mývatn Research Station. There is a long tradition of harvesting duck eggs for home use on the local farms. To ensure sustainability, the harvesting follows strict age-old rules of leaving at least four eggs in a nest for the duck to incubate.

The lava flows and moorlands surrounding the lake are home to rock ptarmigans and occasionally gyr falcons may be present.

===Plants===
Mývatn is one of the few places in the world where marimo grows naturally. Also known as Cladophora ball it is a species of filamentous green algae. Due to environmental factors their population has rapidly declined and the algae appeared to have become extinct in 2013. The ecosystem is now improving and small marimo balls are forming again.

== Volcanism ==


Mývatn was created about 2300 years ago by a large fissure eruption of basaltic lava. The lava flowed down the valley Laxárdalur to the lowland plain of Aðaldalur where it entered the Arctic Ocean about 50 km away from Mývatn. The crater row that formed along the eruptive fissure is called Þrengslaborgir (or Lúdentarborgir ) and has often been used as a textbook example of this type of volcanic activity. There was a large lake in the area at the time, a precursor of the present-day Mývatn. When the lava encountered the lake some of the water-logged lake sediment was trapped underneath it, generating steam explosions.

By repeated explosions in a number of locations, groups of craters built up and now dominate the landscape on the shore of Lake Mývatn and also form some of the islands in the lake. This type of lava formation is known as rootless cones or pseudocraters. A group of such craters at Skútustaðir on the south shore of the lake is protected as a natural monument. Other rootless cone groups in this lava field are in the valley Laxárdalur and the plain Aðaldalur. The formation of rootless cones halted the advance of the lava in some places creating temporary lava lakes. The lava eventually drained from the lakes, leaving behind a forest of rock pillars. The biggest of these formations is named Dimmuborgir. At another place, Höfði , the pillars stand in the lake water. The lava created by the Þrengslaborgir eruption is known as the Younger Laxá Lava.

The Mývatn district lies on the western border of the volcanic zone which cuts across north-eastern Iceland from north to south and is an extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. All geological formations are quite recent, dating from the Ice Age and postglacial times.

The bedrock of the moors west of Mývatn is made up of interglacial lava flows. Most of the mountains in the vicinity of the lake were formed by eruptions under the ice sheet in the glacial periods of the Ice Age. Eruptions that melted their way up through the ice formed table mountains (Bláfjall , Sellandafjall , Búrfell , Gæsafjöll ), those which did not formed hyaloclastite ridges (Vindbelgjarfjall , Námafjall , Dalfjall , Hvannfell ).

At the close of the Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, the Mývatn basin was covered by a glacier which pushed up huge end moraines which can still be seen at the north end of the lake. After the glacier started melting, a glacial lake was dammed up in the Mývatn depression until the glacier retreated from the present course of Laxá river.

Postglacial volcanism in the Mývatn district may be divided into three cycles. The Lúdent cycle commenced shortly after the close of the Ice Age. The explosion crater (tephra ring) Lúdent dates from this cycle. Its eruption was followed by a number of small fissure eruptions. About 3800 years ago the shield volcano Ketildyngja was formed about 25 km south-east of Mývatn, and from it a huge lava flow, the Older Laxá-lava, spread over the southern part of the district, plunged down the valley Laxárdalur and flowed almost to the sea. This lava dammed up the first Mývatn, which was about as large as the present lake.

The second volcanic cycle, the Hverfjall cycle, began 2500 years ago with a gigantic but brief eruption, which formed the explosion crater (tephra ring) Hverfjall (also named Hverfell). An eruption in Jarðbaðshólar followed, producing the lavafield between Reykjahlíð and Vogar. Approximately 200 years later a vast lava flow, the Younger Laxá Lava, was erupted (see above). The lava dammed up the present lake Mývatn and also the lakes Sandvatn , Grænavatn and Arnarvatn .

The third volcanic cycle began with the Mývatnseldar eruptions in 1724–1729 which commenced with an explosion that formed the crater lake Víti . Later lava flowed from Leirhnjúkur down to the north end of Mývatn, destroying two farms. The Mývatnseldar eruptions are quite similar in character to the recent volcanic activity near Krafla in 1975–1984. The source of both is a central volcano lying between Krafla and Gæsafjöll. Inside the volcano resides a magma chamber from which molten magma periodically bursts into a swarm of fissures that cut through the volcano from north to south.

The recent activity was characterized by periods of slow land rise, interspersed by shorter periods of rapid subsidence, underground magma bursts, rifting, earthquakes and eruptions (nine in all). This is an example of the process of continental drift in Iceland. A central volcano and its associated fissure swarm is called a volcanic system. The Krafla volcanic system is one of several such systems which together form the volcanic zone of Iceland.

A few rhyolite mountains border the Krafla central volcano (Hlíðarfjall , Jörundur , Hrafntinnuhryggur ).

Because of its volcanic origin, the lake was formerly mined for diatomite, but this ceased in 2004.

<doc id="691356" wikidata="Q575691" url="?curid=691356" title="Generation of '27">
<text>The Generation of &#x27;27 () was an influential group of poets that arose in Spanish literary circles between 1923 and 1927, essentially out of a shared desire to experience and work with avant-garde forms of art and poetry. Their first formal meeting took place in Seville in 1927 to mark the 300th anniversary of the death of the baroque poet Luis de Góngora. Writers and intellectuals paid homage at the &quot;Ateneo de Sevilla&quot;, which retrospectively became the foundational act of the movement.

==Terminology==

The Generation of &#x27;27 has also been called, with lesser success, &quot;Generation of the Dictatorship&quot;, &quot;Generation of the Republic&quot;, &quot;Generation Guillén-Lorca&quot; (Guillén being its oldest author and Lorca its youngest), &quot;Generation of 1925&quot; (average publishing date of the first book of each author), &quot;Generation of Avant-Gardes&quot;, &quot;Generation of Friendship&quot;, etc. According to Petersen, &quot;generation group&quot; or a &quot;constellation&quot; are better terms which are not so much historically restricted as &quot;generation&quot;.

== Aesthetic style ==

The Generation of &#x27;27 cannot be neatly categorized stylistically because of the wide variety of genres and styles cultivated by its members. Some members, such as Jorge Guillén, wrote in a style that has been loosely called jubilant and joyous and celebrated the instant, others, such as Rafael Alberti, underwent a poetic evolution that led him from youthful poetry of a more romantic vein to later politically engaged verses.

The group tried to bridge the gap between Spanish popular culture and folklore, classical literary tradition and European avant-gardes. It evolved from pure poetry, which emphasized music in poetry, in the vein of Baudelaire, to Futurism, Cubism, Ultraist and Creationism, to become influenced by Surrealism and finally to disperse in interior and exterior exile following the Civil War and World War II, which are sometimes gathered by historians under the term of the &quot;European Civil War&quot;. The Generation of &#x27;27 made a frequent use of visionary images, free verses and the so-called impure poetry, supported by Pablo Neruda.

== Members ==

In a restrictive sense, the Generation of &#x27;27 refers to ten authors, Jorge Guillén, Pedro Salinas, Rafael Alberti, Federico García Lorca, Dámaso Alonso, Gerardo Diego, Luis Cernuda, Vicente Aleixandre, Manuel Altolaguirre and Emilio Prados. However, many others were in their orbit, some older authors such as Fernando Villalón, José Moreno Villa or León Felipe, and other younger authors such as Miguel Hernández. Others have been forgotten by the critics, such as Juan Larrea, Pepe Alameda, Mauricio Bacarisse, Juan José Domenchina, José María Hinojosa, José Bergamín or Juan Gil-Albert. There is also the &quot;Other generation of &#x27;27&quot;, a term coined by José López Rubio, formed by himself and humorist disciples of Ramón Gómez de la Serna, including: Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Edgar Neville, Miguel Mihura and Antonio de Lara, &quot;Tono&quot;, writers who would integrate after the Civil War (1936–1939) the editing board of &quot;La Codorniz&quot;.

Furthermore, the Generation of &#x27;27, as clearly reflected in the literary press of the period, was not exclusively restricted to poets, including artists such as Luis Buñuel, the caricaturist K-Hito, the surrealist painters Salvador Dalí and Óscar Domínguez, the painter and sculptor Maruja Mallo, as well as Benjamín Palencia, Gregorio Prieto, Manuel Ángeles Ortiz and Gabriel García Maroto, the toreros Ignacio Sánchez Mejías and Jesús Bal y Gay, musicologists and composers belonging to the Group of Eight, including Bal y Gay, Ernesto Halffter and his brother Rodolfo Halffter, Juan José Mantecón, Julián Bautista, Fernando Remacha, Rosa García Ascot, Salvador Bacarisse and Gustavo Pittaluga. There was also the Catalan Group who presented themselves in 1931 under the name of &quot;Grupo de Artistas Catalanes Independientes&quot;, including Roberto Gerhard, Baltasar Samper, Manuel Blancafort, Ricard Lamote de Grignon, Eduardo Toldrá and Federico Mompou.

Finally, not all literary works were written in Spanish: Salvador Dalí and Óscar Domínguez also wrote in French. Foreigners such as the Chilean poets Pablo Neruda and Vicente Huidobro, the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, and the Franco-Spanish painter Francis Picabia also shared much with the aesthetics of the Generation of &#x27;27.

The Generation of &#x27;27 was not exclusively located in Madrid, but rather deployed itself in a geographical constellation which maintained links together. The most important nuclei were in Sevilla, around the &quot;Mediodía&quot; review, Tenerife around the &quot;Gaceta de Arte&quot;, and Málaga around the &quot;Litoral&quot; review. Others members resided in Galicia, Catalonia and Valladolid.

== The tendencies of &#x27;27 ==

The name &quot;Generation of 1927&quot; identifies poets that emerged around 1927, the 300th anniversary of the death of the Baroque poet Luis de Góngora y Argote to whom the poets paid homage. It sparked a brief flash of neo-Gongorism by outstanding poets like Rafael Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre, Dámaso Alonso, Luis Cernuda, Gerardo Diego and Federico García Lorca.

== Spanish Civil War aftermath ==

The Spanish Civil War ended the movement: García Lorca was murdered, Miguel Hernandez died in jail and other writers (Rafael Alberti, Jose Bergamin, León Felipe, Luis Cernuda, Pedro Salinas, Juan Ramón Jiménez, Bacarisse) were forced into exile, although virtually all kept writing and publishing late throughout the 20th century.

Dámaso Alonso and Gerardo Diego were among those who reluctantly remained in Spain after the Francoists won and more or less reached agreements with the new authoritarian and traditionalist regime or even openly supported it, in the case of Diego. They evolved a lot, combining tradition and avant-garde, and mixing many different themes, from toreo to music to religious and existentialist disquiets, landscapes, etc. Others, such as Vicente Aleixandre and Juan Gil-Albert, simply ignored the new regime, taking the path of interior exile and guiding a new generation of poets.

However, for many Spaniards the harsh reality of Francoist Spain and its reactionary nature meant that the cerebral and aesthetic verses of the Generation of &#x27;27 did not connect with what was truly happening, a task that was handled more capably by the poets of the Generation of &#x27;50 and the social poets.

<doc id="691374" wikidata="Q2506905" url="?curid=691374" title="James Cassels (British Army officer)">
<text>Field Marshal Sir Archibald James Halkett Cassels, (28 February 1907 – 13 December 1996) was a senior British Army officer who served as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, from 1965 to 1968. As a young man he was a first-class cricket player, initially playing in India for the Europeans against the Hindus in the Lahore Tournament and going on to play for a Punjab Governor&#x27;s XI against Northern India team and for a Viceroy&#x27;s XI against the Roshanara Club. He later played for the British Army cricket team against the RAF at The Oval and then played for the Egyptian national side against HM Martineau&#x27;s XI in Alexandria.

Cassels served in the Second World War as commander of the 152nd Infantry Brigade, commanding the brigade during Operation Goodwood, Operation Totalize and Operation Veritable, before becoming General Officer Commanding 51st (Highland) Division in the closing stages of the war. He later commanded the 1st Commonwealth Division in the Korean War and was General Officer Commanding of the 1 (British) Corps before becoming director of operations in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency.

Cassels went on to be commander, Northern Army Group, then General Officer Commanding Eastern Command and then Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). As Chief of the General Staff, he advised the British government on the implementation of the 1966 Defence White Paper.

==Early life and military career==
James Cassels was born in Quetta, British India (now Pakistan), on 28 February 1907, the son of Robert Cassels (later General Sir Robert Cassels), a British Indian Army officer, and Florence Emily Cassels (née Jackson). Upon being sent to England, he was educated at Rugby School and, later, at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he won the Sword of Honour. Upon Passing out from Sandhurst, Cassels was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Seaforth Highlanders, a line infantry regiment of the British Army, on 30 August 1926. He was posted to Central India with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment in 1928 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 20 August 1929, was appointed aide-de-camp (ADC) to his father in May 1930. He became adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, Seaforths, then serving in England and commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Laurie, who would feature numerous times in his career, in March 1934 and was promoted to captain on 22 March 1938.

==Cricket career==
A right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium/Off spin bowler, he played first-class cricket between 1928 and 1935 and also represented the Egyptian national team.

His first recorded match came in 1921 when he played for his school team against Marlborough College at Lord&#x27;s. His first-class debut was in 1928 when he played for the Europeans against the Hindus in the Lahore Tournament, a tournament similar to the more famous Bombay Quadrangular Tournament but played in Lahore, then a part of India. He played for a Punjab Governor&#x27;s XI against Northern India team in his second first-class match later that month, also in Lahore. He took 6/51 in the second innings of that match, his best innings bowling performance in first-class cricket.

He played his next first-class match in Delhi in February 1932, playing for a Viceroy&#x27;s XI against the Roshanara Club. He played his first first-class match in England that June, playing for the British Army cricket team against the RAF at The Oval, making his highest first-class score of 72. The following year he played for the Egyptian national side against HM Martineau&#x27;s XI in Alexandria, taking five wickets in the second innings of the visitors.

He played his final first-class match in the 1935 English season, playing for the Army against Cambridge University. He continued to play cricket at a lower level, playing for Delhi against Lord Tennyson&#x27;s XI in 1938. After the war, he played twice for the Army against the Royal Navy, in 1948 and 1949, and against Cambridge University in 1949.

==Second World War==
===Service in Britain===
Cassels served in the Second World War, which began in September 1939. The outbreak of war found Cassels serving in England, and he soon attended a shortened course at the Staff College, Camberley. In May 1940 he then became a brigade major with a Territorial Army (TA) unit, the 157th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Sir John Laurie, formerly Cassels&#x27;s commanding officer (CO) in the 2nd Seaforths, part of Major General James Drew&#x27;s 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. The division was sent to France in June 1940 to bolster the French Army in the aftermath of the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s (BEF) evacuation from Dunkirk. Cassel&#x27;s brigade, the first of the 52nd Division&#x27;s brigades to arrive in France, was, soon after its arrival, ordered to form the right of the French Tenth Army at Conches, Normandy. However, the situation was considered to be hopeless and Cassel&#x27;s brigade was later withdrawn through Cherbourg on 18 June. The French signed the second armistice of Compiègne just days later.

He remained with the division until October 1941 when he became Deputy Director (Plans) at the War Office. He returned to the 52nd Division in July 1942, where he became a General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) to Major General Sir John Laurie, the division&#x27;s General Officer Commanding (GOC), who was replaced in September by Major General Neil Ritchie. He remained with the 52nd Division until he received an active command in the shape of the 1st Battalion, Tyneside Scottish in January 1943. The battalion was, along with the 10th and 11th Battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI), part of the 70th Infantry Brigade of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, whose GOC was Major General Henry Curtis until he was succeeded in late April by Major General Evelyn Barker. The division had been assigned a leading role in the invasion of Normandy, which was to take place in spring the following year, and training was extremely tough, conducted in Scotland. Cassels was promoted to major on 30 August 1943. He was not destined to lead the battalion in action, however, as in January 1944 he was promoted to acting brigadier and became Brigadier General Staff (BGS) of XII Corps, serving again under Neil Ritchie, responsible for the planning for Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied invasion of Normandy.

===Northwest Europe===
In late June Cassels was given command of the 152nd Infantry Brigade, one of three brigades forming part of the veteran 51st (Highland) Infantry Division – the others being 153rd and 154th. The division was then fighting in Normandy after having landed there earlier in the month shortly after D-Day on 6 June. The division had, under Major General Douglas Wimberley, fought with distinction in North Africa and Sicily from 1942–43 as part of the British Eighth Army under General Sir Bernard Montgomery, and, by now a veteran formation, had been brought back to the United Kingdom by Montgomery, upon his promotion to command the 21st Army Group in December 1943, to spearhead the Normandy invasion. In France, however, the division, now commanded by Major General Charles Bullen-Smith and war-weary, had performed, Montgomery felt, very poorly. In mid-July, shortly after Cassels took over command of the 152nd Brigade, Montgomery wrote to Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, and informed him that, in his opinion (but shared also by Lieutenant Generals John Crocker and Miles Dempsey, GOCs of I Corps and British Second Army respectively), the 51st Division was, under Bullen-Smith, not battleworthy and decided to replace him with Major General Thomas Rennie, who had served with the division in Africa and Sicily.

Cassels&#x27;s brigade fought briefly in Operation Goodwood, the British attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead, following up behind the 11th Armoured Division and securing the ground gained, in which positions it remained for the next month. The division, now under Major General Rennie, transferring from I Corps to Lieutenant General Guy Simonds&#x27; II Canadian Corps, then took part in Operation Totalize, which succeeded, with Cassels&#x27; brigade taking Tilly-la-Campagne, its objective, with light casualties. The division then participated in Operation Tractable, in an attempt to prevent the German Army from escaping the Falaise Pocket. Cassels was slightly injured, and two nearby officers were both killed, when his brigade HQ was strafed by a friendly US Army Air Force (USAAF) bomber. The brigade later led the division&#x27;s crossing of the river Seine on 1 September and, by the evening, the 5th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders had liberated Saint-Valery-en-Caux.

Alongside the 49th Division, the 51st Division, now serving under I Corps again, was assigned the task of capturing the French port of Le Havre. The attack, codenamed Operation Astonia, began on 10 September and, with Cassels&#x27; brigade having achieved all its objectives, the German garrison surrendered on 12 September.

By October the division was on the Dutch border where, on 23 October, Operation Colin was launched. Cassels&#x27; brigade took the town of Vught and, by 31 October, had reached the river Maas, before going on to clear the area west of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. Finally, the brigade carried out an assault crossing of the Noorder canal and, apart from holding the line, was not involved in any further major actions for the rest of the year.

In January 1945 the brigade was in the Ardennes forest, in February moving to the Reichswald forest where it was involved in Operation Veritable and, despite heavy fighting in terrible conditions, managed to clear the south-western edge of the forest. The brigade, along with the rest of the division, now part of XXX Corps under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, had a short rest after this, and began training for their next assignment, Operation Plunder, an amphibious assault crossing of the river Rhine. The operation began on the night of 23 March 1945, with Cassels&#x27; brigade crossing the river the following day. On the same day, however, the division&#x27;s GOC, Major General Rennie, was killed by mortar fire and replaced as GOC by Major General Gordon MacMillan, a highly experienced and competent commander, who had led Cassels&#x27;s brigade in Sicily. Despite the loss of the GOC, the division, Cassels&#x27;s brigade in particular, was involved in heavy fighting in an attempt to expand the bridgehead. The brigade then advanced across Germany, and was at Bremen by late April, with the end of World War II in Europe following shortly after.
For Cassels&#x27;s leadership of the 152nd Brigade during the Normandy campaign, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 28 September 1944 and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 21 December 1944.

Cassels was promoted to the rank of acting major general and appointed GOC of the 51st Division on 28 May 1945, taking over from Major General MacMillan. Aged just 38, he was the second youngest British divisional commander of the Second World War, with only Major General Richard Hull, GOC of the 5th Infantry Division, being two months younger, and Cassels himself being only three months younger than Major General Philip Roberts, GOC of the 11th Armoured Division. He was mentioned in despatches on 8 November 1945.

==Postwar==
After the war he continued to command the 51st Division in Germany until March 1946 when he was selected to command the 6th Airborne Division. The division, which had fought with distinction in Northwest Europe, was then serving in Palestine during the Palestine Emergency (for further information see 6th Airborne Division in Palestine). Cassels&#x27;s time there was not altogether happy. &quot;I was in Palestine from March 1946 until the end of the year, ten hellish months. I got appallingly rude letters from America, saying that I was much worse than Hitler, addressed to me personally. We nearly had seizures every time we read a newspaper. The general line was that we were anti-semitic beasts and murderers. I don&#x27;t think they realized that many of my men had parachuted into Normandy in June 1944. Large numbers of them were killed and wounded fighting to remove Hitler from the face of the earth.&quot; &quot;It did make one hopping mad to see some of the comments in the Press...denigrating all or most of our actions. They sat in comfort and safety in England while we lived in fairly uncomfortable conditions and under the continued...threat of being blown up!!&quot;

He relinquished command of the division to Major General Eric Bols in early 1947 to return to England, where he attended the prestigious Imperial Defence College. For his services in Palestine he was mentioned in despatches. Promoted to the substantive rank of colonel on 19 August 1947, he became Director of Land / Air Warfare at the War Office in January 1948. Having been promoted to brigadier on 4 March 1948 and to major general on 20 December 1948, he became Chief Liaison Officer with the United Kingdom Services Liaison Staff at Melbourne in Australia on 16 December 1949 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1950. He became the first GOC of the 1st Commonwealth Division in July 1951 during the Korean War for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit in the Degree of Commander by the U.S. President, Harry S. Truman on 16 September 1952 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 10 October 1952.

He was made GOC of the 1 (British) Corps on 4 January 1953 and, having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general on 2 February 1954, became Director of Military Training at the War Office on 15 November 1954. He was appointed director of operations in Malaya on 17 September 1957 during the Malayan Emergency and, having been promoted to full general on 29 November 1958, became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) for Eastern Command on 29 June 1959. He commanded the Northern Army Group and was Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) on 7 January 1960 and, having advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1961, became Adjutant-General to the Forces on 1 June 1963. He became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, on 8 February 1965 and advised the British government on the implementation of the 1966 Defence White Paper which, inter alia, established the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR). He was promoted to field marshal on 29 February 1968 on his retirement from the British Army.

He was also colonel of the Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, The Duke of Albany&#x27;s) from 15 March 1957 and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Military Police from 27 May 1957. He was also a member of the Committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

His interests included fishing, dance music, playing the guitar and the clarinet and playing various sports including cricket, polo and golf. He died at Newmarket in Suffolk on 13 December 1996.

==Family==
In 1935 he married Joyce Kirk; they had one son. Following the death of his first wife, he married Joy Dickson in 1978.

<text>Field Marshal Sir Geoffrey Harding Baker, (20 June 1912 – 8 May 1980) was Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, from 1968 to 1971. He served in the Second World War and became Director of Operations and Chief of Staff for the campaign against EOKA in Cyprus during the Cyprus Emergency and later in his career provided advice to the British Government on the deployment of troops to Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles.

==Military career==
Born the son of Colonel Cecil Norris Baker and Ella Mary Baker (née Hutchinson) and educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Baker was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on 28 January 1932. He was promoted to lieutenant on 28 January 1935 and was posted later that year to Meerut in India.

Baker served in the Second World War and, having been promoted to captain on 28 January 1940, and posted as a staff officer to Headquarters Middle East in May 1940. He took part in the campaign in East Africa, during which he fought at the Battle of Keren for which he was awarded the Military Cross on 8 July 1941, was wounded three times, and was mentioned in despatches on 30 December 1941 and on 15 December 1942. He was appointed Commanding Officer of 127 Field Regiment RA in July 1943 and, having been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services in the Middle East on 14 October 1943, he led his regiment during the Allied invasion of Sicily. In March 1944 he joined to staff at 21st Army Group and took part in the Normandy landings and the campaign in North West Europe, being mentioned in despatches on 10 May 1945, appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 24 January 1946, and awarded the Legion of Merit in the Degree of Commander by the President of the United States on 17 September 1948.

After the war, Baker co-ordinated administrative services in the Allied Control Commission in Germany. Promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 July 1946, he was appointed deputy director of Staff Duties at the War Office in January 1947. After promotion to lieutenant colonel on 31 December 1951, he took command of 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery at Munsterlager and, following promotion to colonel on 20 June 1953 and having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1955, he became Director of Operations and Chief of Staff for the campaign against EOKA in Cyprus in November 1955 during the Cyprus Emergency, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the New Year Honours 1958. He became Assistant Chief of Staff at Headquarters Northern Army Group in February 1959 and, on promotion to major general on 3 February 1960, he was appointed Chief-of-Staff at Southern Command. He went on to be Chief of Staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in November 1961, in which capacity he was responsible for contingency planning for Berlin at the time of the construction of the Berlin Wall.

Following his appointment as Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff with the rank of lieutenant general on 2 September 1963, and having been advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours, Baker became General Officer Commanding Southern Command on 31 October 1966. Promoted to general on 7 May 1967 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1968, Baker was appointed Chief of the General Staff on 1 March 1968. In this role he provided advice to the British Government on the deployment of troops to Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles: his assessment was that Special Branch had inadequate intelligence on the IRA. He was promoted to field marshal on 31 March 1971, on his retirement from the British Army.

In retirement he became Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery from July 1964, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Military Police from March 1968, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Horse Artillery from November 1970 and Master Gunner, St. James&#x27;s Park from 1970.

Baker was taken ill at Wellington College and died in hospital on 8 May 1980.

<doc id="691385" wikidata="Q337070" url="?curid=691385" title="Michael Carver">
<text>Field Marshal Richard Michael Power Carver, Baron Carver, (24 April 1915 – 9 December 2001) was a senior British Army officer. Lord Carver served as the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, and then as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), the professional head of the British Armed Forces. He served with distinction during the Second World War and organised the administration of British forces deployed in response to the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya and later in his career provided advice to the British government on the response to the early stages of The Troubles in Northern Ireland.

==Military career==
===Early career===
Carver was born in April 1915, during the First World War, the son of Harold Power Carver, a British Army officer, and Winifred Anne Gabrielle Carver (née Wellesley) He was educated at Winchester College and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, where he was awarded the King&#x27;s Medal, which went to the highest-ranking gentlemen cadet in the order of merit. From Sandhurst, Carver was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Tank Corps of the British Army on 1 February 1935. After receiving special-to-arm training at the Tank Corps Depot in Bovington, Dorset, he joined the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Tank Corps at Farnborough, Hampshire, in October. He then attended a short course at the Royal Military College of Science before returning to his battalion. He was promoted to lieutenant on 31 January 1938. Soon after this promotion he went to Egypt with the 1st (Light) Battalion of his regiment, which, with the formation of the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) in April 1939, became the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), with Carver&#x27;s battalion becoming the 1st Royal Tank Regiment.

===Second World War===
He served in the Second World War, which began in September 1939, with Carver still serving in Egypt. In late December he was made a camp commandant at the headquarters of the Mobile Division (Egypt) which in February 1940 became the 7th Armoured Division. Three months later he was promoted to the acting rank of captain and was made staff captain with the divisional HQ. In this role he was responsible for organising the division&#x27;s logistical support, a post he held during the early stages of the Western Desert campaign, fought mainly against the Italians, and for which he was later to be mentioned in dispatches, once in April 1941, and again in July.

In the aftermath of the campaign Carver was sent to Palestine where, from April to August, he attended the Staff College, Haifa, before returning to the 7th Armoured Division, now with the acting rank of major, initially as a Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (DAQMG) and later as a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2). The duration of his stay was very short, however, as he was soon sent to Cairo as a GSO2 to help create a new corps HQ, XXX Corps, with which he served until August 1942, which included during Operation Crusader and in many of the most critical battles of the North African campaign in which the corps participated. During that time he was promoted yet again, to the war substantive rank of captain and temporary major, in November 1941. His performance as a staff officer during this period was recognised with his being awarded the Military Cross in September 1942, a month after his promotion to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel at the relatively young age of twenty-seven. He also received a new appointment at this time, becoming GSO1, essentially chief of staff, of the 7th Armoured Division. He served with this formation in several engagements, including the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, and throughout most of the Tunisian campaign which followed. He received a promotion to the permanent rank of captain in January 1943.

He was appointed Commanding officer of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment in April 1943, leading them in North Africa for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 4 May 1943 and in Italy for which he was awarded a Bar to his DSO on 24 February 1944. He was appointed commander of the 4th Armoured Brigade on 27 June 1944 after its previous commander, Brigadier John Cecil Currie, was killed in action. With his new appointment came a promotion to the acting rank of brigadier, making Carver, at just twenty-nine, the youngest of his rank in the British Army. He led his brigade in the remainder of the fighting in Normandy and then throughout the subsequent campaign in North West Europe which followed until the German surrender in May 1945. He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1945.

===Post-War===
Carver became a Technical Staff officer to the Ministry of Supply in 1947, and having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 31 January 1948, he became Assistant Quartermaster-General (Plans) at Headquarters Allied Forces Central Europe in May 1951 and then head of the exercise planning staff at SHAPE in October 1952. Having been promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 27 March 1954 and to colonel on 17 June 1954, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff at East Africa Command in June 1954; he took part in the closing stages of the response to the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya for which he was mentioned in despatches on 19 July 1955. He was then elevated to Chief of Staff in East Africa in October 1955 and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 8 March 1957. After attending the Imperial Defence College during most of 1957, he was appointed Director of Plans at the War Office in London in February 1958, Commander of the 6th Brigade at Münster in January 1960 and General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 3rd Division with the rank of major-general on 4 September 1962. His division was deployed to Cyprus in February 1964 and he was made Director of Army Staff Duties at the Ministry of Defence on 7 October 1964 and it was in this role that he famously substantially reduced the size of the Territorial Army (TA).

Having been advanced to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was made GOC Far East Land Forces with the rank of lieutenant-general on 28 July 1966, tri-service Commander-in-Chief of Far East Command in 1967 and, having been promoted to full general on 29 March 1968, GOC Southern Command on 12 May 1969. After being advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1970 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS) on 1 April 1971 in which role he provided advice to the British government on the response to the early stages of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Having been promoted to field marshal on 18 July 1973, he became Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) on 21 October 1973 before retiring in October 1976. In July 1977 he became a life peer as Baron Carver, of Shackleford in the County of Surrey.

===Retirement===
Carver was also Colonel Commandant of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers from February 1966, of the Royal Tank Regiment from January 1968, of the Bristol University Officer Training Corps from March 1972 and of the Royal Armoured Corps from April 1974.

In August 1977 he was appointed resident commissioner designate for Rhodesia with responsibility for ending the dispute over independence there but resigned after fourteen months of deadlock. He wrote a number of books on military history and was a vocal critic of Britain&#x27;s Trident missile programme, believing that as the American nuclear strike capability was sufficiently powerful it was inefficient for Britain to have an independent program.

His interests included sailing, tennis and gardening. He died on 9 December 2001 in Fareham, Hampshire.

==Family==
In 1947 he married Edith Lowry-Corry, a granddaughter of Henry Lowry-Corry; they had two sons and two daughters. Lady Carver died in 2019. Carver&#x27;s mother was related to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

<text>ColorSync is Apple Inc.&#x27;s color management API for the Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X operating systems.

==Version history==

Apple developed the original 1.0 version of ColorSync as a Mac-only architecture, which made it into an operating system release in 1993. In the same year, Apple co-founded the International Color Consortium (ICC) to develop a cross-platform profile format which became part of ColorSync 2.0. The system &quot;Color Management Module&quot; (CMM) was &quot;LinoColorCMM&quot;, which was developed by Linotype-Hell AG (now part of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG). The same CMM was used in Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP under the rubric of &quot;Image Color Management&quot; (ICM). Apple, with the help of Adobe had ported ColorSync 2.0 and its SDK to Microsoft Windows. With ColorSync 3.0, the Windows version which was initially planned was discontinued. ColorSync 4.0 is the latest version, introduced in Mac OS X 10.1.

==Overview==
Human color perception is a very complex and subtle process, and different devices have widely different color gamuts or ranges of color they can display. To deal with these issues, ColorSync provides several different methods of doing color matching. For instance, &quot;perceptual&quot; matching tries to preserve as closely as possible the relative relationships between colors, even if all the colors must be systematically distorted in order to get them to fit within the gamut of the destination device. Because the human eye is more sensitive to color differences rather than absolute colors, this method tends to produce the best-looking results, subjectively speaking, for many common uses, but there are other methods that work better in some cases.
==Profiles and color spaces==

As dictated by the ICC system, the &quot;profile connection space&quot; in ColorSync is the CIE XYZ color space. All image input and output devices (scanners, printers, displays) have to be characterized by providing an ICC profile that defines how their color information is to be interpreted relative to this reference color space. This profile might be provided by the device manufacturer, but for better quality results, it might be generated by performing actual measurements on the device with a colorimeter. Thus, when an image is scanned on a scanner, the image file will include a copy of the scanner&#x27;s profile to characterize the meaning of its color information. Then, before the image is sent to an output device, a &quot;matching&quot; process converts the color information at the time of rendering from the &quot;source profile&quot; (that attached to the image) to the &quot;destination profile&quot; (that attached to the output device) so that the resulting colors print or display as closely as possible to the original image.
==ColorSync Utility==

&quot;ColorSync Utility&quot; is software that ships with Mac OS X. It is used for management of color profiles and filters used in Apple&#x27;s PDF workflow, or applying filters to images and PDF documents.

The interface is composed of two parts: the document browser and the utility window. The document browser lets you zoom in and out of an image or apply a Filter to it. The utility window has several options: Profile First Aid, Profiles, Devices, Filters and Calculator.

* &quot;Profile First Aid&quot; allows you to repair ColorSync color profiles so they conform to the International Color Consortium specification.

* &quot;Profiles&quot; allows you to browse the profiles installed on your system, grouped by location, class or space, and graphically compare any two profiles.

* The profile map is displayed as a rotatable, scalable 3D object and can be plotted in CIELAB, CIELUV, Yxy, Yuv and CIEXYZ.

* The &quot;Devices&quot; section allows you to see a list of all registered ColorSync devices such as your displays and printers, and see what ColorSync profile is applied to each one. You can also override the default setting.

* The &quot;Filters&quot; section allows you to build and modify PDF filters that are available to the rest of the operating system. Each filter can be set to appear in one of three domains: Application, PDF Workflows, and Printing.

Filters set to Printing will appear in the drop-down menu under the &quot;Save as PDF...&quot; button in the standard Mac OS X print dialog box. Filters set to PDF Workflow will appear in the Quartz Filters drop-down menu in the ColorSync section of a print dialog box. The default filters that ship with Mac OS X are:

* Black &amp; White

* Blue Tone

* Create Generic PDFX-3 Document

* Gray Tone

* Lightness Decrease

* Lightness Increase

* Reduce File Size

* Sepia Tone.

User-created filters can have color management, image effects, PDF retouch, domain selection and comments.

The &quot;Color Management&quot; section allows assigning a profile, choosing a default profile, rendering intent, converting to a profile or intermediate transform.

The &quot;Intermediate Transform&quot; section allows adjustment of brightness, tint, hue, saturation, bilevel (high pass filter) or profile assignment, to either grayscale, RGB or CMYK, or all data in the file. This can be applied to either text, graphics, images or shading.

Complex filters can be created by stacking multiple effects. Any changes made to the PDF file can then be saved as a new PDF file.

&quot;Calculator&quot; can convert between RGB, CMYK and other color value schemes, and features an interactive color-picker for identifying a color on the screen, duplicating a feature of another bundled utility, &quot;Digital Color Meter&quot;.

<text>General Sir Peter Mervyn Hunt, (11 March 1916 – 2 October 1988) was Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, from 1973 to 1976. He served in the Second World War and commanded British Forces deployed in response to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. Later in his career he provided advice to the British Government at a time of continuing tension associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

==Military career==
Hunt was the son of H. V. Hunt and educated at Wellington College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders on 30 January 1936.

He saw action during the Second World War and was promoted to captain on 30 January 1944. Later that year he was given the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed Commanding Officer of the Seaforth Highlanders, leading them in North West Europe and receiving the Distinguished Service Order on 10 May 1945. After the war he was appointed a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium and Croix de guerre.

Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours 1948, he was given the substantive rank of major on 30 June 1949 and became an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley from 1952 and then an instructor at the Imperial Defence College from 1956 before being promoted to lieutenant colonel on 7 June 1957 and being given command of the 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders. Promoted to colonel on 7 March 1960, he became Commander of 152nd (Highland) Infantry Brigade in 1960 and Chief of Staff at Scottish Command in 1962.

Hunt was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 17th Gurkha Division and Land Forces Borneo and promoted to major general on 1 February 1964 (the post was redesignated 17th Gurkha Division and Malaya District from 1 December 1965 when the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation drew to a close). For his service in Borneo he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was appointed Commandant of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 19 January 1966 and went on to be General Officer Commanding Far East Land Forces with the rank of lieutenant general on 16 November 1968. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1969, he became Commander Northern Army Group and Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine with the rank of general on 1 December 1970. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1973 and also appointed ADC General to the Queen that year, Hunt was appointed Chief of the General Staff on 19 July 1973 at a time of continuing tension associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He retired from the British Army on 12 August 1976.

He was also Colonel of the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) from 7 February 1966 to 1975 and Colonel of the 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles from 1 August 1966 to 1975.

In retirement Hunt became Constable of the Tower of London from 1 August 1980 and Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall from 4 August 1982. He lived at Portloe in Cornwall.

Hunt&#x27;s personal interests included shooting and medical charities: he was President of the National Smallbore Rifle Association and Chairman of the Council of the King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in London. He died on 2 October 1988.

==Family==
In 1940 he married Anne Stopford; they had one son and one daughter. Following the death of his first wife he married Susan Davidson in 1978.

<text>Field Marshal Sir Roland Christopher Gibbs, (22 June 1921 – 31 October 2004) was Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, from 1976 to 1979, and Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire from 1989 to 1996. He saw active service in the Second World War and acted as chief of staff to the commander of the operation to evacuate all British troops and civilians from Aden during the Aden Emergency.

==Early life and education==
Gibbs was born on 22 June 1921, the son of Major Guy Melvil Gibbs and Margaret Gibbs (née St John). He was educated at Eton College, an all-boys independent boarding school in Berkshire, and trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. 

==Military career==
Gibbs was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 31 December 1939, almost four months after the British entry into the Second World War. He was not immediately involved in action, however, as he was deemed to be too young, and remained in the United Kingdom until he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, KRRC, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Erskine and in the process of reforming after sustaining severe casualties during the siege of Calais. Gibbs, promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1941, was to serve with the battalion for the rest of the war and was deployed to North Africa with his battalion in late 1941, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) on 15 October 1942. After participating in the Second Battle of El Alamein, he took command of &#x27;C Company&#x27; of his battalion in March 1943 and remained in that role for the rest of the war. Commanding his company throughout the final stages of the Tunisian campaign, he later took part in the Allied invasion of Italy and in the first few weeks of the Italian campaign. This was followed by action during the Normandy landings and the subsequent fighting in North West Europe until Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) in May 1945. Throughout this time, from D-Day to VE Day, one of his fellow officers was Edwin Bramall. Like Gibbs himself, Bramall was destined to reach the very highest ranks. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 2 August 1945.

With the end of World War II in Europe, Gibbs was posted to the South-East Asian theatre where he served, briefly, as a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) at the HQ of Allied Land Forces South-East Asia (ALFSEA). After the surrender of Japan, he was posted to the 5th Parachute Brigade as its brigade major. However, he returned to the 2nd KRRC after the 5th Para Brigade was disbanded. Gibbs was promoted to captain on 1 July 1946 and deployed to Palestine during the Palestine Emergency, serving with the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion, part of the 6th Airborne Division (see the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine). He then became an instructor at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in December 1948. Promoted to major on 31 December 1952, he was posted as Brigade Major of 5th Infantry Brigade at Iserlohn in Germany and in 1957 he became a staff officer in Whitehall dealing with inter-service planning. In 1960 he was appointed Commanding Officer of 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment and in 1963, as a temporary brigadier, went on to command 16 Parachute Brigade which deployed that year to Cyprus in a peace keeping role. Promoted to colonel on 4 July 1964, he was posted to Aden in 1966 as chief of staff to Admiral Sir Michael Le Fanu who was commander of the operation to evacuate all British troops and civilians during the Aden Emergency. He was promoted to the substantive rank of brigadier on 6 December 1966 and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours 1968.

He was appointed Commander of British Land Forces in the Persian Gulf on 30 April 1969 in which role he re-organised the Trucial Oman Scouts and laid the foundations for what is now the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Land Forces. Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1972, he became Commander of 1st (British) Corps with the rank of lieutenant general on 14 January 1972 and Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces with the rank of full general on 1 April 1974. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1976 and having become ADC General to the Queen on 25 June 1976, he became Chief of the General Staff on 15 July 1976. In this capacity he had to deal with the challenges of recruitment and retention in the army at a time of high inflation. He was promoted to field marshal on 13 July 1979 on his retirement from the British Army.

He was also colonel commandant of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Green Jackets from 1971 and colonel commandant of the Parachute Regiment from 1972.

Gibbs retired to a former rectory in Wiltshire, where his pastimes were shooting, hunting with the Beaufort, and painting. He was the Constable of the Tower of London from 1985 to 1990 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire from 1989 to 1996.

His interests included shooting and hunting: he used to follow the Beaufort Hunt until a medical operation on his knee halted further participation. He was also a keen amateur artist. He died on 31 October 2004.

==Family==
In 1955, Gibbs married Davina Merry, the artist; they had two sons, and a daughter.

<text>Field Marshal Edwin Noel Westby Bramall, Baron Bramall (18 December 1923 – 12 November 2019), also known as &quot;Dwin&quot;, was a British Army officer. He served as Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, between 1979 and 1982, and as Chief of the Defence Staff, professional head of the British Armed Forces, from 1982 to 1985.

==Early life and family==
Bramall was born on 18 December 1923 in Tonbridge, Kent, England, the son of Major Edmund Haselden Bramall (1889−1964) (son of Ernest Edward Bramall (1864–1938), managing director of Desford Colliery, Leicester) by his wife Katherine Bridget Westby. He was educated at Eton College, where, among other accomplishments, he captained an undefeated first XI cricket team.

In 1949 he married Dorothy Avril Wentworth Vernon, by whom he had one son and one daughter. His elder brother Ashley Bramall was a barrister, Labour politician and Leader of the Inner London Education Authority.

==Military career==
Bramall was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps on 22 May 1943, during the Second World War. He took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and served with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment in Northwest Europe during the later stages of the war, receiving the Military Cross on 1 March 1945, shortly before the end of World War II in Europe.

Bramall was promoted to lieutenant on 18 June 1946 and served in the occupation of Japan from 1946, before becoming an instructor at the School of Infantry in 1949. Promoted to captain on 18 December 1950, he was stationed in the Middle East from 1953 and was then promoted to major on 18 December 1957. Continuing his military career, he served two years as an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, from 1958, and then was appointed to serve on Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s staff in 1963.

Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1965 New Year Honours, and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 25 January 1965, he was appointed Commanding Officer of the 2nd Green Jackets, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps: the Battalion was deployed to Borneo during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in the first half of 1966 where his actions earned him a mention in despatches. He was given command of the 5th (Airportable) Infantry Brigade in November 1967 with promotion to brigadier on 31 December 1967.

Bramall was made General Officer Commanding the 1st Division on 6 January 1972, with the substantive rank of major general from 6 April 1972, Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong with the rank of lieutenant general on 1 December 1973 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1974 New Year Honours. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces on 15 May 1976 and was promoted to full general on 25 June 1976.

He was appointed Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics) on 20 March 1978, advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1979 New Year Honours, before being made ADC General to the Queen on 26 June 1979 and appointed Chief of the General Staff on 14 July 1979. In this role he strongly supported the plan in May 1982 to land troops at San Carlos Water and then advance rapidly from those positions at the early stages of the Falklands War.

Bramall was promoted to field marshal on 1 August 1982, and appointed Chief of the Defence Staff on 1 October that year. In this capacity he developed the concept of the &quot;Fifth Pillar&quot; pulling together the activities of defence attachés to form a structure for intervention in smaller countries. He retired in November 1985. He was also Colonel of the 3rd Battalion the Royal Green Jackets from December 1973, Colonel of the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) from 14 September 1976 and Colonel Commandant of the Special Air Service from 19 May 1985.

==Later career==

Following his retirement from active military duty Bramall served as Lord Lieutenant of Greater London from 1986 to 1998. He was invested as a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1990. He served as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1988. and was an Honorary Life Vice President of the MCC. His other interests included painting and travel and he was a vice-president of the welfare organisation SSAFA Forces Help.

Bramall was created a life peer as Baron Bramall, of Bushfield in the County of Hampshire in 1987. Bramall spoke out in the House of Lords against the involvement of the United Kingdom in the Second Iraq War warning that &quot;unlike naked aggression, terrorism cannot be defeated by massive military means&quot; but by &quot;competent protection and positive diplomacy&quot;.

On 27 August 2006 it was reported that Bramall, then aged 82, hit Lord Janner of Braunstone, then 78, after Bramall made what witnesses claim were a series of &quot;anti-Israel&quot; comments during an argument over the Lebanon conflict. Janner sought the advice of fellow peers about how and whether to make a formal complaint against Bramall, before deciding to accept an apology after which Janner said the matter was resolved.

On 25 April 2013 Bramall retired from service in the House of Lords. He died at the age of 95 on 12 November 2019, at his home in Crondall, Hampshire

==Operation Midland==

Bramall was one of several senior establishment figures targeted by convicted perjurer Carl Beech: following fabricated complaints made by Beech officers of the Metropolitan Police searched Bramall&#x27;s home near Farnham on 4 March 2015 as part of the Operation Midland child sexual abuse investigation. Bramall released a statement after the search, saying: &quot;Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated.&quot; On 30 April 2015, under the same investigation, Lord Bramall attended a police station in Surrey by appointment. While officers interviewed him for two hours, they did not charge or arrest him.

On 15 January 2016, the police confirmed that there was insufficient evidence to bring any charges and he would face no further action. Bramall&#x27;s wife Lady Bramall died in July 2015, without knowing that he would not be charged. In October 2016, after what &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as a &quot;chorus of calls&quot; for an official apology to Lord Bramall, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to Bramall.

On 1 September 2017, it was reported that the Metropolitan Police had paid substantial compensation to Bramall for having raided his home &quot;after accepting that the searches had been unjustified and should never have taken place.&quot;

Beech was subsequently arrested and committed to stand trial on 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud in May 2019; he was convicted on all charges, and in July 2019 was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. The court was told that &quot;immeasurable distress&quot; had been caused to those falsely accused as well as &quot;obvious reputational damage&quot;. Bramall said of the ordeal: &quot;I can honestly say however I was never as badly wounded in all my time in the military as I have been by the allegations made by [Beech] that formed the basis of Operation Midland.&quot;

<text>Field Marshal Sir Nigel Thomas Bagnall, (10 February 1927 – 8 April 2002) was a career British Army officer who served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine, from 1983 to 1985, and then as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, from 1985 to 1988. Early in his military career he saw action during the Palestine Emergency, the Malayan Emergency, the Cyprus Emergency and the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and later in his career he provided advice to the British Government on the future role of Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons.

==Army career==
Born in British India, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Harry Stephen Bagnall and Marjory May Bagnall and educated at Wellington College, Bagnall undertook National Service for a year before being commissioned into the Green Howards on 5 January 1946. Shortly afterwards, however, on 13 February 1946 he transferred to the Parachute Regiment and was deployed to Palestine where the British Mandate was about to end. Promoted to lieutenant on 24 September 1949, he served in Malaya, where as a platoon commander, he was awarded the Military Cross in 1950, and a bar to the Military Cross in 1952.

Promoted to captain on 10 February 1954, he returned to the Green Howards in summer 1954 and then took part in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA units in Cyprus in 1955. He transferred to the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards on 24 April 1956. He was promoted to major on 10 February 1961 and appointed Military Assistant to the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff in May 1964 and then became the Senior Staff Officer dealing with intelligence activities for operations in Borneo in March 1966.

Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 31 December 1966, he became the Commanding Officer of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards in 1967 and served in that capacity in Omagh in Northern Ireland and Sennelager in Germany. Promoted to colonel on 31 December 1969, he became Commander Royal Armoured Corps in 1st (British) Corps in December 1970, before receiving further promotion to brigadier on 31 December 1970. He went on to be Secretary of the Chiefs of Staff Committee at the Ministry of Defence in September 1973. He was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 4th Division on 21 September 1975 with the substantive rank of major general from 1 November 1975 and Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Policy) at the Ministry of Defence on 7 January 1978.

He became commander of 1st (British) Corps on 1 November 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general and, having been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1981, went on to be Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine and Commander of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group with the rank of general on 1 July 1983. As Commander of the Northern Army Group he grappled with NATO&#x27;s strategy of forward defence, when he persuaded the Germans that some ground would have to be surrendered to withstand a massive Soviet Army attack.

After being advanced to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1985 and also becoming ADC to the Queen on 30 July 1985, he was appointed Chief of the General Staff in August 1985 in which capacity he was closely involved in the debate about the future role of Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons. He was promoted to field marshal on 9 September 1988 on his retirement from the British Army.

He was also appointed Colonel Commandant of the Army Physical Training Corps on 5 February 1981 and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Armoured Corps on 1 August 1985.

In retirement he became a military historian and fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He wrote a history of the Punic wars published in 1990 and, two years after his death, he had a history of the Peloponnesian War published.

He died on 8 April 2002, at the age of 75.

==Family==
In 1959 he married Anna Caroline Church; they had two daughters.

<doc id="691423" wikidata="Q977028" url="?curid=691423" title="John Chapple (British Army officer)">
<text>Field Marshal Sir John Lyon Chapple, (27 May 1931 – 25 March 2022) was a British Army officer who served as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, from 1988 to 1992. Early in his military career he saw action during the Malayan Emergency and again during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and later in his career he provided advice to the British government during the Gulf War.

==Early life==

Chapple was born in Maida Vale, London, to Charles Chapple and Elsie Lyon. Elsie was a doctor; Charles served in the army during the First World War, first on the Western Front in France and later in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq).

Chapple attended Haileybury College, his time there coinciding with the Second World War; on one occasion a German V-1 flying bomb landed near the school, damaging the buildings. At school, he discovered a passion for drama and took part in five expeditions with the British Exploring Society.

==Early military career==
Chapple undertook National Service and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 3 June 1950. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1951, studying German and history. While still at University, he transferred to the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) as a second lieutenant on 4 December 1952, and to the South Lancashire Regiment also in the same rank on 20 October 1953. He became a lieutenant in the South Lancashire Regiment on 27 May 1954 and, on leaving University, transferred to the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) on 3 August 1954. retaining his rank as a lieutenant.

At the time Chapple joined the Gurkhas, they were engaged in fighting in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency, against communist guerrillas attempting to overthrow British colonial rule. Chapple spent three years with the regiment in intense jungle combat in southern Johor. He was promoted to captain on 9 February 1957. In 1962, he was sent to the army&#x27;s Staff College, Camberley, in Surrey in preparation for higher rank, and then promoted major on 9 February 1964. He was sent to Germany to take up an administrative position in the British Army of the Rhine before re-joining the Gurkhas, this time in Borneo, again involved in jungle warfare, this time against Indonesia as part of the Indonesian Confrontation. Appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1969 and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 31 December, he was appointed commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Gurkha Rifles in 1970. He commanded the battalion in Singapore, and then in Hong Kong, both British colonies at the time. The troops were stationed near the border between Hong Kong and China due to tensions between the new communist regime and the west.

Chapple was appointed to the Directing Staff at the Staff College, Camberley in 1972. After spending much of the year as a services fellow at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge in 1973, he was posted to the Directorate of Staff Duties at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at the end of the year, with promotion to colonel on 31 December 1973. During his tenure at the MoD, the army was faced with issues in Northern Ireland, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (1974), while the newly installed Labour government sought to make defence cutbacks east of Suez. He was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1975, and given command of the Gurkha Field Force, stationed in Hong Kong, in 1976. He became Principal Staff Officer to the Chief of the Defence Staff in 1978, serving first Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Neil Cameron and later Admiral of the Fleet Sir Terence Lewin.

==High command==
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1980 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, and returned once more to Hong Kong as Commander British Forces on 13 June 1980, with the substantive rank of major general from 1 January 1981. He returned to the United Kingdom to be Director of Military Operations at the MoD on 19 October 1982. Northern Ireland was again high on the army&#x27;s agenda, and Chapple was among those advocating for prisoner of war status for Provisional Irish Republican Army prisoners, to allow their detention indefinitely. During his tenure, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government embarked on a programme of centralisation of the armed forces and Chapple represented the army on the committee overseeing it. The committee eliminated the position of Vice Chief of the General Staff, the deputy head of the army and the position which would have been Chapple&#x27;s next post.
Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1985 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Chapple became the inaugural Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Programmes and Personnel) on 2 January 1985 in the rank of lieutenant general. The post was a centralised one, with responsibilities to all three services, and resulted from the reforms Chapple had been part of in his previous position. He was promoted to the rank of general on 29 June 1987, and appointed Commander-in-Chief, United Kingdom Land Forces. He was appointed Aide-de-Camp General to the Queen on 6 October 1987 and advanced to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1988 Birthday Honours. After a relatively brief tour as commander-in-chief, his last appointment was as Chief of the General Staff (the professional head of the army) from 10 September 1988. Chapple was in-post for the implementation of the Options for Change reforms brought in with the end of the Cold War served in this post, in which he provided military advice to the British Government on the conduct of the Gulf War, until he retired with promotion to field marshal on 13 February 1992. Although widely expected to be the next Chief of the Defence Staff (professional head of all the armed forces), the post instead went to Sir Peter Harding of the Royal Air Force.

Chapple was appointed Colonel of the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) on 14 September 1986, and Honorary Colonel of the Oxford University Officers Training Corps on 21 July 1987.

==Later career==
Chapple was also a trustee of the Gurkha Museum from 1973 to 2003, a trustee of the National Army Museum from 1981 to 2003, a trustee of the World Wildlife Fund UK from 1988 to 1993, President of the Zoological Society of London from 1992 to 1994 and Governor of Gibraltar from 1993 to 1995.

==Personal life==
In 1959 Chapple married Annabel Hill, whom he met through a university friend; they have one son and three daughters. Their daughter, Rachel Lucy Chapple, is a social anthropologist. Their son, David Chapple, is a consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon.

Chapple&#x27;s interests included military history.

Chapple died on 25 March 2022, aged 90, at his home in Salisbury after a short illness.

<doc id="691425" wikidata="Q118936" url="?curid=691425" title="Rafael Alberti">
<text>Rafael Alberti Merello (16 December 1902 – 28 October 1999) was a Spanish poet, a member of the Generation of &#x27;27. He is considered one of the greatest literary figures of the so-called &quot;Silver Age&quot; of Spanish Literature, and he won numerous prizes and awards. He died aged 96.
After the Spanish Civil War, he went into exile because of his Marxist beliefs. On his return to Spain after the death of Franco, he was named Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía in 1983 and Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad de Cádiz in 1985.

He published his memoirs under the title of &quot;La Arboleda perdida&quot; (&#x27;The Lost Grove&#x27;) in 1959 and this remains the best source of information on his early life.

==Life==

===Early life===

El Puerto de Santa María at the mouth of the Guadalete River on the Bay of Cádiz was, as now, one of the major distribution outlets for the sherry trade from Jerez de la Frontera. Alberti was born there in 1902, to a family of vintners who had once been the most powerful in town, suppliers of sherry to the crowned heads of Europe. Both of his grandfathers were Italian; one of his grandmothers was from Huelva, the other from Ireland. However, at some point, while they were handing down the business to the next generation, bad management resulted in the &quot;bodegas&quot; being sold to the Osbornes. As a result, Alberti&#x27;s father was no more than a commercial traveller for the company, always away on business, as the general agent for Spain for brands of sherry and brandy that had, before, only been exported to the UK. This sense of belonging to a &quot;bourgeois family now in decline&quot; was to become an enduring theme in his mature poetry. At the age of 10, he entered the Jesuit &quot;Colegio San Luis Gonzaga&quot; as a charity day-boy. During his first year, Alberti was a model student but his growing awareness of how differently the boarders were treated from the day-boys, together with the other ranking systems operated by the Jesuits, inspired in him a desire to rebel. In his memoirs, he attributes it to growing class conflict. He began to play truant and defy the school authorities until he was finally expelled in 1917. However, his family was then at the point of moving to Madrid which meant that the disgrace did not register on Alberti or his family as strongly as it might have done.

The family moved to Calle de Atocha in Madrid in May 1917. By the time of the move, Alberti had already shown a precocious interest in painting. In Madrid, he again neglected his formal studies, preferring to go to the Casón del Buen Retiro and the Prado, where he spent many hours copying paintings and sculptures. It was as a painter that he made his first entries into the artistic world of the capital. For example, in October 1920, he was invited to exhibit in the Autumn Salon in Madrid. However, according to his memoirs, the deaths in 1920 in quick succession of his father, the matador Joselito, and Benito Pérez Galdós inspired him to write poetry.

In 1921, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and he spent many months recuperating in a sanatorium in the Sierra de Guadarrama where he read avidly among the works of Antonio Machado and Juan Ramón Jiménez, as well as various Ultraist and &quot;Vanguardista&quot; writers. At this time, he also met Dámaso Alonso, at that time a poet rather than the formidable critic he would become, and it was he who introduced Alberti to the works of Gil Vicente and other Golden Age writers. He began to write poetry in earnest and submitted a few, successfully, to various avant-garde magazines. The book that resulted from this activity, &quot;Marinero en tierra&quot; (Sailor on Dry Land), submitted at the last minute, won the National Poetry Award in 1925.

He enjoyed great success over the next few years in the sense of artistic prestige: he was still financially dependent on his family. The new literary magazines were eager to publish his works. He was also starting to make friends with the people who would eventually get grouped together as the Generation of &#x27;27. He already knew Dámaso Alonso and, on one of his returns to Madrid, he met Vicente Aleixandre, a resident of the &quot;Salamanca&quot; district. It was probably in October 1924 – Alberti&#x27;s memoirs are vague on this and many other details – that he met Federico García Lorca in the Residencia de Estudiantes. He was known to have a rocky relationship with him, since Lorca was gay and Alberti didn&#x27;t approve of his sexuality. They weren&#x27;t best of friends, but when Lorca finally died, in 1936, he dedicated a poem to him. During further visits to the &quot;Residencia&quot; - it seems that he never actually became a member himself - he met Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillén, and Gerardo Diego along with many other cultural icons such as Luis Buñuel, and Salvador Dalí.

The kind of folkloric/&quot;cancionero&quot; poetry he had used in &quot;Marinero&quot; was also employed in two further collections – &quot;La amante&quot; (&#x27;The Mistress&#x27;) and &quot;El alba del alhelí&quot; (&#x27;Dawn of the Wallflower&#x27;) – but with the approach of the Góngora Tercentenary he began to write in a style that was not only more formally demanding but which also enabled him to be more satirical and dramatic. The result was &quot;Cal y canto&quot; (&#x27;Quicklime and Plainsong&#x27;). Alberti himself was present at the meeting at a Madrid cafe in April 1926, when the plans for the tercentenary were first sketched out - along with Pedro Salinas, Melchor Fernández Almagro and Gerardo Diego.

Before the Tercentennial celebrations were over, Alberti was starting to write the first poems of &quot;Sobre los ángeles&quot; (&#x27;Concerning the Angels&#x27;), a book that showed a complete change of direction in the poetry of not only Alberti, but also the whole Group, and is generally considered his masterpiece. His next collections, &quot;Sermones y moradas&quot; (&#x27;Sermons and mansions&#x27;) and &quot;Yo era un tonto y lo que he visto me ha hecho dos tontos&quot; (&#x27; I was a fool and what I have seen has made me two fools&#x27;), together with a play &quot;El hombre deshabitado&quot; (&#x27;The Empty Man&#x27;), all showed signs of a psychological breakdown which, to the surprise of everyone who knew him, had overwhelmed Alberti and from which he was only saved by his elopement with the writer and political activist María Teresa León in either 1929 or 1930 – again his memoirs are not clear on the date.

===Marriage, conversion to Marxism, civil war and exile===
The inference from his memoirs is that she played a key role, along with his continuing bitter memories of the &quot;Colegio&quot;, in the process that converted the easy-going, carousing bohemian of the early books into the committed Communist of the 1930s. The establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 was another factor that pushed Alberti towards Marxism and he joined the Communist Party of Spain. For Alberti, it became a religion in all but name and there is evidence that suggests that some of his friends tired of his unceasing attempts to &quot;convert&quot; them. As a Party emissary, he was finally freed from financial dependence on his family and he made several trips to northern Europe. But when Gil Robles came to power in 1933, the violent attacks that Alberti launched against him in the magazine &quot;Octubre&quot; (&#x27;October&#x27;), which he had founded with María Teresa, led to a period of exile.

At the start of the Spanish Civil War he was imprisoned in Ibiza and released in August 1936 when the island returned to Republican control. By November 1936 he was in Madrid having commandeered an aristocrat&#x27;s palace (Palacio de Zabálburu) near Retiro Park as headquarters of his Alianza de Intelectuales Anti-fascistas (Alliance of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals), which became a second home to Gerda Taro. During the Spanish Civil War, Alberti became the poetic voice of the left and he made frequent broadcasts from the capital during the Siege of Madrid by the Francoist armies, composing poems in praise of the defenders of the city. He published them in a magazine entitled &quot;El Mono Azul&quot; which he cofounded with his wife. There was scarcely an edition of the XV International Brigade newspaper, &quot;Volunteer for Liberty&quot;, which did not contain one of his poems. He also took part in a commission in charge of the purge of the Alliance members.

In early 1939 he and his wife were in Elda running a large country house as a hotel, at which many Republicans gathered considering exile. These included La Pasionara, Enrique Líster and Juan Modesto. After the defeat of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces and the disbandment of the Republic by the rebel faction, Alberti and María fled to Paris via Oran and moved into an apartment together with Pablo Neruda on the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge. They lived in Paris until the end of 1940 working as translators for French radio and as announcers for the broadcasts of &quot;Paris-Mondial&quot; in Latin-America. After the German occupation of France they sailed from Marseilles to Buenos Aires on the SS Mendoza.

They lived in Argentina until 1963. Amongst other activities – he worked for the Losada publishing house and continued writing and painting - Alberti worked in the Argentinian film industry, notably as the adaptor of a play by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, &quot;La dama duende&quot; (&#x27;The Ghost Lady&#x27;) in 1945. They then moved to Rome. On 27 April 1977 they returned to Spain. Shortly after his return Alberti was elected deputy for Cádiz in the constituent Congress of the Spanish parliament on the Communist Party Ticket. His wife died on 13 December 1988 from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

He died at the age of 96 from a lung ailment. His ashes were scattered over the Bay of Cádiz, the part of the world that mattered most to him.
==Other awards that he earned==
He was also awarded Lenin Peace Prize for the year 1964 - after lobbying from Pablo Neruda - and Laureate Of The International Botev Prize in 1981. In 1983, he was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the Spanish literary world&#x27;s highest honour. In 1998, he received the America Award for his lifetime contribution to international writing.

==Poetry==
===The early phase===
Although &quot;Marinero en tierra&quot; is generally referred to as Alberti&#x27;s first book, it was in fact his second; an earlier book, &quot;Giróscopo&quot; (&#x27;Gyroscope&#x27;), having been lost, although it seems probable that some of its contents were included in a volume of &quot;Poesías anteriores a Marinero en tierra&quot; (&#x27;Poems before &quot;Marinero en tierra&quot;&#x27;) that he compiled during his time in Rome. &quot;Marinero&quot; shows a compendium of different influences: the style of Gil Vicente and the mediaeval &quot;cancioneros&quot;, to which Alonso had introduced him; a highly organised, formal, baroque style derived from Rubén Darío&#x27;s Modernismo - and ultimately from the poetry of Garcilaso de la Vega, Pedro Espinosa, and possibly Góngora; along with traces of Ultraism. Linking these various influences together are the poet&#x27;s facility – writing poetry seems to come to him very easily – and an air of naivety and innocence that are in fact carefully contrived. When the book was submitted for the Premio Nacional, the book was called &quot;Mar y tierra&quot; (&#x27;Sea and land&#x27;) and the title &quot;Marinero en tierra&quot; was reserved for one single series of poems inside the whole collection. This is the most close-knit series of poems in the entire collection and deserves consideration as a single long poem. It also introduces two enduring themes in his work – his love of his native sea and nostalgia for his childhood. The poems in this sequence are nearly all written in lines of irregular length and irregular assonances and derive most obviously from the &quot;cancionero&quot; tradition.

&quot;La amante&quot; (1925) and &quot;El alba del alhelí&quot; (1926) followed in quick succession. These early works were influenced by traditional songs and folklore. Alberti had settled on a style and was writing fluently within it. He was working on the poems which would form &quot;El alba&quot; when he was invited by his brother, who had succeeded their father as a wine-salesman, to take a trip with him to the Cantabrian coast. Alberti had never before visited northern Spain and the car-trip through the villages and mountains made a strong impression on him. In &quot;La amante&quot;, his brother is replaced by the figure of an imaginary girl-friend and he assumes the persona of a troubadour, writing short and generally light-hearted verses about the sights they saw. &quot;El alba&quot;, on the other hand, was written mainly during holidays he spent with two of his married sisters in Málaga and Rute, a claustrophobic Andalusian mountain village. He had by now met García Lorca and seems to be trying to emulate him. However, what in Lorca is tragic, violent and death-laden tends to seem false and melodramatic in Alberti.

===Maturity===

His next collection, &quot;Cal y canto&quot; (1926-8), is a big departure. He rejects some of the folkloric influences of the previous two works and picks up again the baroque forms, such as the sonnets and tercets, and also the Ultraist thematic material of &quot;Marinero&quot;. He had been placed in charge of collecting the poems dedicated to Góngora as part of the Tercentenary celebrations and there are many signs of Góngora&#x27;s influence on this work. Alberti&#x27;s technical versatility comes to the fore as he writes sonnets, ballads, tercets and even a pastiche of the intricate style of the Soledades. More significantly, there is a sense of unease hanging over the whole collection. Traditional values – myths, religion, convention – are found wanting, but more modern values such as speed, freedom and iconoclasm are also found to be hollow. The nymphs, shepherdesses and mythological figures of renaissance and Baroque poetry are brought into contact with department stores and other aspects of modern life only to appear banal.

There is a sense in this collection that Alberti is writing in this collection as himself, not as the sailor, the troubadour or the tourist of his earlier books. He even wrote a poem about a heroic performance by the goalkeeper of FC Barcelona - &quot;Oda a Platko&quot; - in a match against Real Sociedad in May 1928. &quot;The violence displayed by the Basques was unbelievable&quot;, he wrote in his memoirs. &quot;At one desperate moment Platko was attacked so furiously by the players of the Real that he was covered with blood and lost consciousness a few feet from his position, but with his arms still wrapped around the ball.&quot;

The most significant poem in the collection is probably the final one, &quot;Carta abierta&quot; (&#x27;Open Letter&#x27;). He makes it clear that he is writing as Rafael Alberti, child of the Bay of Cádiz and the twentieth century. He contrasts the confinement of the classroom with the freedom of the seashore, the excitement and novelty of the cinema with the boredom of lessons, the conventions of traditional literature and ideas with the revolution of radio, the aeroplane, the telephone. In the confusion caused by the clash of old and new values, the poet has a premonition of the feelings of emptiness and desolation that were soon to assail him but he decides to align with the new.

===&quot;Sobre los ángeles&quot; and the works of breakdown===

Picking up on the sense of unease that hangs over &quot;Cal y canto&quot;, Alberti now begins to mine a vein of deep and anguished introspection. He has lost his youthful high spirits and finds himself &quot;deshabitado&quot; (&#x27;empty&#x27;). An unhappy love affair seems to have been the immediate catalyst but the pit of despair into which Alberti plunged was peopled also by deeper-rooted shadows of his life, notably recollections of his rebellious childhood and the hell-fire sermons of the Jesuits at the &quot;Colegio&quot;, a friend&#x27;s suicide, and a full awareness of his own position at the age of 25, misunderstood by his family, penniless, still living at home (it was only after he met María Teresa that he finally moved out) and with no other way of earning a living other than through his poetry. In this black mood,

:&quot;What was I to do? How was I to speak or shout or give form to that web of emotions in which I was caught? How could I stand up straight once again and extricate myself from those catastrophic depths into which I had sunk, submerging and burying myself more and more in my own ruins, covering myself in my own rubble, feeling my insides to be torn and splintered? And then there was a kind of angelic revelation – but not from the corporeal, Christian angels found in all those beautiful paintings and religious icons, but angels representing irresistible forces of the spirit who could be moulded to conform to my darkest and most secret mental states. I released them in waves on the world, a blind reincarnation of all the cruelty, desolation, terror and even at times the goodness that existed inside of me but was also encircling me from without.&quot;
:&quot;I had lost a paradise, the Eden of those early years...&quot;
The first section of &quot;Sobre los ángeles&quot; (1927-8) consists almost entirely of poems on the loss of love and the poet&#x27;s consequent feeling of being emptied. The metres are short and contain many irregular lines while still retaining an overall regularity of assonance and rhythm. The central section explores a sense of betrayal by religion. His childhood beliefs were dispelled very early by his fanatical aunts and the Jesuits of the &quot;Colegio&quot; but he still needs to find something to believe in to dispel his feelings of emptiness and rootlessness. The third and final section sees a radical change of style. The short lines of the previous sections give way to much longer lines that grow into the tangled webs of surreal imagery that he was to use in his next few works – &quot;Sermones y moradas&quot;, &quot;Con los zapatos puestos...&quot;, and &quot;Yo era un tonto...&quot;. The key to understanding this collection is probably the poem &quot;Muerte y juicio&quot; (&#x27;Death and Judgment&#x27;). The child has lost his innocence and belief in a way that was almost predestined before his birth. He recalls one specific incident from his schooldays, when the day-boys played truant and went to the beach to bathe naked and masturbate. They were spotted by a Jesuit teacher and subjected to agonising and humiliating sermons convincing them that they would lose their souls by doing such things.

&quot;Sermones y moradas&quot; (1929–31) was neither clearly conceived as a unified work nor ever completed. It consists of poems in free verse, full of complex surrealist imagery that is almost impenetrable. They convey an atmosphere of helplessness and total desolation.

&quot;Yo era un tonto y lo que he visto me ha hecho dos tontos&quot; (1929) is Alberti&#x27;s homage to the American silent comedians whose films he admired so greatly – Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Harry Langdon etc. Morris has been able to track down some of the specific scenes that inspired these poems but the poems themselves are still in the dense style that Alberti had adopted.

&quot;Con los zapatos puestos tengo que morir&quot; (&#x27;With My Shoes On I Must Die&#x27;) (1930) – a quote from Calderón – is his final work in this style. Written in the aftermath of the exhilaration of being involved in the anti-Primo de Rivera riots, whilst still impenetrably dense at times, it shows the beginning of the socially aware poetry that would be the next direction he would take.

===Poetry of the 30s===
In July 1936, there was a gathering to hear García Lorca read &quot;La casa de Bernarda Alba&quot;. Subsequently, Dámaso Alonso recalled that there was a lively discussion about a certain writer - probably Rafael Alberti - who had become deeply involved in politics. &quot;He&#x27;ll never write anything worthwhile now,&quot; was Lorca&#x27;s comment. This is probably an unduly sweeping comment to make. Alberti&#x27;s political commitment manifested itself in two distinct ways: an unoriginal party-line verse whose only saving grace is the technical skill and fluency that he could bring to bear even on such routine exercises, and a far more personal poetry in which he draws from his memories and experience to attack the forces of reaction in a more direct, less opaque way than in his earlier collections.

&quot;De un momento a otro&quot; (&#x27;From One Moment to the Next&#x27;) (1932-8) contains the poem &quot;Colegio (S.J.)&quot; which yet again revisits his memories of his schooldays. Here, however, the Jesuits&#x27; treatment of the day-boys is analysed in a way that shows the poet&#x27;s newly acquired class consciousness – it is depicted as a systematic way of indoctrinating a sense of inferiority.

&quot;13 bandas y 48 estrellas&quot; (&#x27;13 Stripes and 48 Stars&#x27;) (1935). During the 1930s, Alberti was able to make many journeys under the sponsorship of the Communist Party. This book is an account of a visit to the Caribbean and the US, which gave him ample scope to write poems denouncing capitalism.

&quot;Capital de la gloria&quot; (&#x27;Capital of Glory&#x27;) (1936-8). This collects the poems that he wrote in commemoration of the siege of Madrid during the Spanish Civil War. It includes heartfelt but dull tributes to various Republican generals and to the International Brigades as well as poems about the peasant-soldiers that can come across at times as patronising. Alberti himself saw little or no action – he was either abroad or in the comparative safety of offices or broadcasting-studios – but there are some forceful poems for reciting to the troops that might have been inspiring. It is also worth noting that this collection shows a return to more tightly disciplined verse forms.

&quot;Entre el clavel y la espada&quot; (&#x27;Between the Carnation and the Sword&#x27;) (1939–40). This collection gathers the poems that Alberti wrote in France and Argentina at the start of his long exile. It marks a change in style, the feel for a need to regain his discipline as a poet. As a result, it resembles &quot;Marinero en tierra&quot; in its formal approach – sonnets, &quot;cancionero&quot;-style poems etc. A key theme that emerges in this collection is a deep and abiding nostalgia for Spain, the land from which he has been exiled.

===Later works===
&quot;A la pintura&quot; (&#x27;On Painting&#x27;) (1945- ). During his exile, Alberti took up painting again and began a series of poems to draw together his thinking on this subject, to which he continued to add over a period of many years. He wrote a series of sonnets about the raw materials – the retina, the hand, the canvas, the brush etc.; a series of short poems in free verse about colours; and finally a series of poems in homage to various painters such as Titian, El Greco etc.

&quot;Ora Maritima&quot; (&#x27;Maritime Shore&#x27;) (1953). This is a collection dedicated to Cádiz, in recognition of its antiquity. The poems take as their subject-matter the historical and mythological past of the city – Hercules, the Carthaginians etc. – as well as bringing into play the poet&#x27;s childhood across the bay.

&quot;Retornos de lo vivo lejano&quot; (&#x27;Memories of the Living Distance&quot;) (1948–52) and &quot;Baladas y canciones de la Paraná&quot; (&#x27;Ballads and Songs of the Paraná&#x27;) (1955). These collections contain poems of memory and nostalgia in a highly lyrical style. Once again he recalls his schooldays but this time in a mood of sadness. He also recalls his mother, his friends – especially Vicente Aleixandre who was too ill to leave Madrid during the Civil War - the death of Lorca and he also supplies a moving tribute to his wife.

==Other works==

Alberti was not especially interested in writing for the theatre but he managed to make a big impact with at least two plays. The first was one of the outputs of his breakdown at the end of the 1920s, &quot;El hombre deshabitado&quot; (&#x27;The Empty Man&#x27;, 1930). This is like a modern auto sacramental with five characters: Man with his Five Senses in allegorical reincarnation, The Maker, The Wife of Man, and Temptation, the last-named a woman who plots the downfall of both protagonists in complicity with the Senses. On the opening night, 26 February 1931, it met with a stormy reception from a sharply polarised audience.

Shortly afterwards, he began to write a ballad on the life of Fermín Galán, an army captain who had tried to launch a coup to establish a Spanish Republic in December 1930 and who was executed by firing-squad. Alberti converted the ballad into a play which was performed during June 1931, again to sharply mixed reactions.

His other plays did not achieve such fame or notoriety. They include: &quot;De un momento a otro&quot; (&#x27;From One Moment to Another&#x27;, 1938–39), &quot;El trébol florido&quot; (&#x27;Clover&#x27;, 1940), &quot;El adefesio&quot; (&#x27;The Disaster&#x27;, 1944) and &quot;Noche de guerra en el Museo del Prado&quot; (&#x27;A Night of War in the Prado Museum&#x27;, 1956), as well as adaptions and other short pieces.

Alberti also wrote several volumes of memoirs under the title &quot;La arboleda perdida&quot;. Portions have been published in English as &quot;The Lost Grove&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* There is a Rafael Alberti bookstore in the centre of Madrid, in the Argüelles district, since 1975.
* There is a Rafael Alberti Museum that operates as a legacy foundation in the poet&#x27;s hometown of El Puerto de Santa María, Cádiz.
* The Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998) by Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi features a debate about the creators versus the masters of Spanish and Latin American poetry. The debate places Rafael Alberti along with Vicente Aleixandre, Vicente Huidobro, Pedro Salinas, and Jorge Guillén as masters of poetry.

<text>Field Marshal Peter Anthony Inge, Baron Inge (5 August 1935 – 20 July 2022) was a senior British Army officer. He was the Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, from 1992 to 1994 and then served as Chief of the Defence Staff before retiring in 1997. Early in his military career he saw action during the Malayan Emergency and Operation Banner in Northern Ireland, and later in his career he provided advice to the British Government during the Bosnian War.

==Early life and education==
The son of Raymond Albert Inge and Grace Maud Caroline Inge (née Du Rose), Inge was born in Croydon on 5 August 1935. He was educated first at Summer Fields School, Oxford and then at Wrekin College, Shropshire. He was conscripted into the army for National Service in September 1953 and was sent for officer cadet training at Eaton Hall, Cheshire before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Inge was commissioned into the Green Howards from Sandhurst on 27 July 1956. He was promoted to lieutenant on 27 July 1958, served with the 1st Battalion the Green Howards in Hong Kong and Germany, and was deployed on operational service to Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. Appointed aide-de-camp to the General Officer Commanding 4th Division in 1960, he was promoted to captain on 27 July 1962, and made adjutant of the 1st Battalion the Green Howards in 1963.

After working in the Ministry of Defence, and being promoted to major on 31 December 1967, Inge returned to the 1st Battalion as a company commander in 1969 and was deployed to Northern Ireland. He served as brigade major with the 11th Armoured Brigade from August 1971, before being promoted to lieutenant colonel on 31 December 1972, and becoming an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley in 1973. He was appointed commanding officer of the 1st Battalion the Green Howards in 1974. Promoted to colonel on 31 December 1976, he commanded the Staff College&#x27;s Junior Division from 1977 and, following his promotion to brigadier on 31 December 1979, he commanded Task Force C of the British Army of the Rhine from 1980. From 1982 he was Chief of Staff of I (British) Corps. He returned to Britain as General Officer Commanding North East District and Commander 2nd Infantry Division, based in York, from 12 January 1984 with the substantive rank of major general from 16 April. In 1986, he was appointed Director General, Logistics Policy (Army) at the Ministry of Defence.

Inge was promoted to lieutenant general and became General Officer Commanding I (British) Corps on 8 August 1987. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1988 New Year Honours. He relinquished the corps command on 2 October 1989 and, on 27 November, he became the commander of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group and Commander-in-Chief of British Army of the Rhine in Germany with the local rank of general; his rank was made substantive on 3 January 1990.

Having become aide-de-camp general to the Queen on 21 February 1991 and promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1992 New Year Honours, Inge was appointed Chief of the General Staff in February 1992 and Chief of the Defence Staff with the rank of field marshal on 15 March 1994. Inge was the last active officer to be promoted to the rank. He served in this post, in which he provided military advice to the British government on the conduct of the Bosnian War, until he retired in 1997. He was appointed Colonel of the Green Howards in 1982, Colonel Commandant of the Royal Military Police in 1987, and Colonel Commandant of the Army Physical Training Corps in 1988.

==Later career==

Inge was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of North Yorkshire (DL) in 1994.

After stepping down as Chief of the Defence Staff, he was created a life peer as Baron Inge, of Richmond in the County of North Yorkshire, in 1997. Inge was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter on 23 April 2001, and retired from the Lords on 25 April 2016, where he had been an opponent of further EU integration.

In 2004 Inge was made a Privy Counsellor and appointed to serve as a member of the Butler Inquiry team, which examined the use of intelligence during the Iraq War. Chaired by Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell, the inquiry determined that the intelligence used to declare Iraq&#x27;s possession of &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; was flawed. He was critical of the British handling of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, reportedly saying in 2006 that he &quot;feared we had lost the ability to think strategically&quot;.

In retirement Inge became a non-executive director of Racal Electronics plc, commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, trustee of the Historic Royal Palaces, and president of the Army Benevolent Fund. He was a member of the advisory board of Aegis Defence Services, a private military company based in London having previously, until February 2010, been the chairman of the board of directors.

==Personal life==
Inge enjoyed watching cricket, walking, reading and music. He was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club, Boodle&#x27;s and several other gentlemen&#x27;s clubs.

In 1960 Inge married Letitia Thornton-Berry; they had two daughters, Antonia and Verity. Lady Inge died in 2020. Inge died on 20 July 2022, at the age of 86.

<text>Field Marshal Charles Ronald Llewelyn Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank, (born 17 November 1938) is a retired senior officer of the British Army who served as Chief of the General Staff from 1994 to 1997 and Chief of the Defence Staff from 1997 until his retirement in 2001.

Guthrie&#x27;s military career saw service with the Welsh Guards and the Special Air Service; he was closely involved in military operations in Northern Ireland and provided advice to the British Government during the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War.

==Early life==

Born in Chelsea, London into a Scottish landed family, Guthrie was the elder son of Major Ronald Guthrie and Nina &quot;née&quot; Llewelyn. He was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

As an Old Harrovian, and due to his seniority in the British Army, Harrow School&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force contingent, the Harrow Rifle Corps, chose to name an annual inter-CCF competition in Guthrie&#x27;s honour. The Guthrie Cup is a Section patrol competition, run for school CCFs in London District, supported by adult volunteers and cadets from the Harrow Rifle Corps and local Army Cadet Force detachments.

==Army career==

Guthrie was commissioned into the Welsh Guards on 25 July 1959. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1961 and captain on 25 July 1965. In 1966 he became a troop commander with 22 Special Air Service Regiment serving in Aden, the Persian Gulf, Malaysia and East Africa and then in 1968 he became a squadron commander with 22 Special Air Service Regiment serving in the Persian Gulf and the United Kingdom. He returned to the Welsh Guards in Münster in 1970 and, following his promotion to major on 31 December 1970, he was given command of a mechanised infantry company in the 1st Battalion. He became Military Assistant to the Chief of the General Staff in 1973 and, following a year as Second in Command of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards in London and Cyprus and having been promoted to lieutenant colonel on 31 December 1975, he became brigade major for the Household Division in 1976. Guthrie was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO &quot;fourth class&quot;) in the 1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours; on 31 December 1984 this rank was reclassified as Lieutenant (LVO).

Guthrie was appointed commanding officer of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards in 1977 in which role he was deployed to Berlin. Promoted to colonel on 31 December 1979, he undertook a tour of duty in Northern Ireland in Spring 1980 for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In 1980 he was also briefly Commander of British Forces in the New Hebrides. He then spent two years as Colonel on the General Staff for Military Operations at the Ministry of Defence. Promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1981, he became Brigade Commander of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1982. In 1984 he was made chief of staff for 1st British Corps in Bielefeld. Following his appointment as general officer commanding (GOC) North East District and Commander 2nd Infantry Division based in York on 18 January 1986, he was given the substantive rank of major general on 31 March 1986.

On 24 November 1987, Guthrie became Assistant Chief of the General Staff at the Ministry of Defence. On 2 October 1989 he was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed GOC 1st British Corps, and, having been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1990 New Year Honours, he relinquished his command on 2 December 1991.

Guthrie was appointed Commander of Northern Army Group and British Army of the Rhine on 7 January 1992 and, following promotion to (full) general on 14 February 1992, became ADC to the Queen on 13 July 1993.

Guthrie then became Chief of the General Staff (CGS) on 15 March 1994, being advanced to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1994. As CGS, he was responsible for providing strategic military advice to the British Government on the deployment of troops for the Bosnian War, and also in 1996 updated the British Military Doctrine.

Guthrie went on to become Chief of the Defence Staff on 2 April 1997. In that position, he advised the British Government on the conduct of the Kosovo War. He also warned against a British invasion of Zimbabwe to undertake regime change against Robert Mugabe, saying &quot;Hold hard, you&#x27;ll make it worse.&quot;

Guthrie retired from the British Army in 2001.

Guthrie was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Intelligence Corps on 1 March 1986 and Colonel Commandant of the Special Air Service in 2000. For twenty years he served as Colonel of The Life Guards and Gold Stick-in-Waiting to The Queen, from 1 January 1999 to 7 June 2019.

==Post-career activities==
After retiring from the British Army, he was created a life peer as Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank, of Craigiebank in the Dundee City council area, in June 2001. Lord Guthrie sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords. He was one of several retired Chiefs of Defence Staff who spoke out in the House of Lords about the risk to servicemen facing liability for their actions before the International Criminal Court, particularly with respect to the invasion of Iraq. George Monbiot criticised Guthrie for an alleged lack of understanding of international law. Monbiot based his argument on Guthrie&#x27;s September 2002 statement for an invasion of Iraq and subsequent comments, in which he appeared to support launching &quot;surprise wars&quot;, something forbidden by the United Nations Charter. Guthrie disagreed publicly with Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008 over military funding.

In 2007 Guthrie co-authored a book on ethics in modern warfare with Sir Michael Quinlan, formerly Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence.

Guthrie was promoted to the honorary rank of field marshal in June 2012.

Guthrie has served as a non-executive director of Gulf Keystone Petroleum, Rivada Networks, Ashley Gardens Block 2 Ltd, Colt Defense LLC and Sciens Capital; he has served as a director of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, Gulf Keystone, and Petropavlovsk PLC; he has served as a non-executive chairman of Siboney Ltd.; he has been a shareholder of Palantir Technologies and the global strategic intelligence firm Arcanum, which is a subsidiary of Magellen Investment Holdings. He is also a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009. He is president of several charities, including Action Medical Research, the Army Benevolent Fund, Soldier On!, and the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Association. Until 2019, he was also the president of London Youth (Federation of London Youth Clubs). He is a Deputy Lieutenant for Dorset. 
Guthrie was one of several contributors to a 2013 book on public sector management. A Roman Catholic convert, Guthrie became a Knight of Malta and is a Patron of the Catholic homeless charities Cardinal Hume Centre and Caritas Anchor House. He became Chancellor of Liverpool Hope University in July 2013.

In August 2014, Lord Guthrie was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue. He initially supported the continuance of the United Kingdom&#x27;s presence in the European Union in the 2016 referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of the European Union, but suddenly switched to an advocacy of withdrawing from it less than a week before the vote was held, issuing a public warning of the ambitions inherent in the E.U. for the creation of a new &quot;European Army&quot;, which he stated &quot;would be a disaster&quot;. He is on the advisory board of Veterans for Britain an organization with the stated aim of supporting &quot; Her Majesty&#x27;s Government in the task of restoring full sovereign control to all aspects of the defence of the Realm &quot; following the EU referendum.

Since 1 August 2017 Lord Guthrie has been the Senior Advisor to Ron Wahid, Chairman of Arcanum, a subsidiary of Magellan Investment Holdings. Established 23 March 2015, Magellan Investment Holdings is a holding company with investments in natural resources, energy, real estate, fine arts, aerospace and defense and technology. Magellan is the parent company of two subsidiaries: Arcanum, a global intelligence firm, and RJI Capital, a merchant banking and strategic advisory company.

On 9 June 2018 it was reported that, at the annual Trooping the Colour event, Lord Guthrie fell from his horse and had been admitted to hospital. On 8 January 2019, in an extraordinary intervention in the political sphere by figures from the military and intelligence services quarter, Guthrie sent a letter, co-signed by Sir Richard Dearlove, to Conservative Party Parliamentary Constituency Association Chairs, stating that the passage through the House of Commons of Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s Withdrawal Agreement of the United Kingdom from the European Union contained decisions which fundamentally undermined the integrity of the Defence of the Realm, and requested they take measures to discourage their parliamentary representatives from voting for it imminently in the Commons. The letter as an alternative advocated the case upon national security grounds that the United Kingdom should fully withdraw from the European Union without an Intergovernmental relationship between the two persisting after the process.

On relinquishing his appointment as Colonel of The Life Guards and Gold Stick-in-Waiting, The Queen appointed Lord Guthrie a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 7 June 2019. On 1 December 2020, he retired from the House of Lords. His interests include tennis, opera and travel.

==Family==

He married, on 11 September 1971, Catherine Worrall, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Claude Worrall, Coldstream Guards. The couple have two sons. She died from heart failure on 8 October 2022, at the age of 81. Guthrie&#x27;s younger brother is James Guthrie, KC.

Lord Guthrie matriculated his family armorial bearings at the Lyon Office in 1999 (and in 2001 was granted supporters for life).

<text>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories is a semi-autobiographical collection of three stories by American author Norman Maclean (1902–1990) published in 1976. It was the first work of fiction published by the University of Chicago Press.

The collection contains the novella &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; and two short stories, &quot;Logging and Pimping and &#x27;Your pal, Jim and &quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky&quot;, which precede the events of the novella. It received widespread acclaim upon its publication and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977, but the selection committee ultimately did not award the prize in that category that year. Two of the stories were later adapted into feature films.

==&quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;==
&quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; is a semi-autobiographical account of Maclean&#x27;s relationship with his brother Paul and their upbringing in an early 20th century Montana family in which &quot;there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.&quot; Pete Dexter, in a 1981 profile of Maclean in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, described the novella:

As he describes his brother&#x27;s alcoholism and gambling addiction, Maclean also explores how both afflictions have always followed the history of his family, even back to their earliest origins among Scottish Gaelic-speaking Presbyterians on the Isle of Mull.

The story is noted for using detailed descriptions of fishing and the Montana landscape to engage with a number of profound metaphysical questions. In a review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, critic Alfred Kazin stated: &quot;There are passages here of physical rapture in the presence of unsullied primitive America that are as beautiful as anything in Thoreau and Hemingway&quot;.

==&quot;Logging and Pimping and &#x27;Your pal, Jim==

&quot;Logging and Pimping and &#x27;Your pal, Jim tells the story of Maclean working as a logger for the Anaconda Company at a logging camp on the Blackfoot River during the summer of 1928, when he was 25 and in graduate school. At the end of the previous summer working at the camp (1927), Maclean had made an arrangement to work the next summer with the camp&#x27;s best logger, Jim Grierson. Maclean describes how Grierson would work the logging season at a camp, then find a town with a nice Carnegie Public Library, get a library card, find a prostitute, preferably from the South, and spend the off-season reading, drinking, and having a relationship with the woman.

==&quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky&quot;==

&quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky&quot; tells of part of the summer of Maclean&#x27;s 17th year, 1919. He spent that summer, as he had the previous two, working for the United States Forest Service, this time at Elk Summit, Idaho, west of Blodgett Canyon and approximately walking distance almost due west-northwest of Hamilton, Montana, near White Sand Creek, and north of East Fork Moose Creek.

Working for the Forest Service in a very remote part of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness in the Selway National Forest (now Clearwater National Forest), Maclean had to extinguish wildfires, build trails (with a sledgehammer, chisel, and dynamite), pack horses and mules, spend time alone on lookout duty at Grave Peak, and string telephone wire.

The Elk Summit Work Center is located at the junction of Horse Creek and Hoodoo Creek, north-northwest of Hoodoo Mountain and north-northeast of Hoodoo Lake, at (46.3265874, −114.6476053) and an elevation of .

==Publishing history==

&quot;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&quot; was first published by the University of Chicago Press in May 1976. This first edition included a jacket illustration and several spot drawings and vignettes, created on scratchboard by the book&#x27;s designer, Robert Williams. Williams&#x27;s illustrations were retained in several subsequent printings and editions of the book. For the first paperback edition, Williams&#x27;s blue jacket design was replaced by a landscape photograph by John B. Roberts showing Seeley Lake and surrounding forests, the site of Norman Maclean&#x27;s cabin. In 1983, the University of Chicago Press published an illustrated edition of the title novella with color photographs by Joel Snyder and a new postscript by Maclean commenting on the photographs. 

In 1989, the University of Chicago Press and Pennyroyal Press collaborated to publish an edition designed and illustrated with woodcuts by &quot;America&#x27;s preeminent booksmith&quot; Barry Moser, which remains in print. Moser&#x27;s engravings include a portrait of Norman Maclean&#x27;s brother Paul, an illustration of Paul&#x27;s fishing hat, and illustrations of trout flies tied by George Croonenberghs, who tied flies for the Maclean family. &quot;On the reverse of each illustrated page we find the fly&#x27;s colloquial name and brief advice on how it may be fished.&quot; Pennyroyal Press published a collector&#x27;s edition of the illustrated volume limited to 200 copies signed by Maclean and Moser. 

With the release of Robert Redford&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;A River Runs through It&quot;, the University of Chicago Press licensed a mass-market, movie tie-in edition to Pocket Books and released a trade paperback edition with a re-designed cover featuring a painting by Russell Chatham. In 2001, the University of Chicago Press published a twenty-fifth anniversary edition of &quot;A River Runs through It and Other Stories&quot; with a foreword by Annie Proulx. In 2017, the press replaced that edition with a newly typeset and designed edition featuring a foreword by Robert Redford.

==Pulitzer Prize==
In 1977, the Pulitzer Prize committee for Fiction (a.k.a. &quot;fiction jury&quot;) recommended &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; be awarded the prize for that year. The Pulitzer Prize Board, which has final say for awarding the prize, chose to override their recommendation and decided not to award for fiction that year. Pete Dexter wrote in 1981 that the board called it &quot;a lean year for fiction&quot; but speculated about their true reasons: &quot;I know just enough about the Pulitzer people to guess that what happened was that one of them noticed the trees too.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===&quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;===
In 1992, Robert Redford directed a film of the same name starring Brad Pitt, Craig Sheffer, Tom Skerritt, Brenda Blethyn, and Emily Lloyd. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, with Philippe Rousselot winning for his cinematography. The film fueled a rise in the popularity of fly fishing for a number of years before the sport waned to previous levels.

===&quot;The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky&quot;===

&quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky&quot; was adapted into a 1995 ABC television film titled &quot;The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky&quot;, also known simply as &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot;. The film was directed by John Kent Harrison, with the adaptation written by Robert Wayne, and stars Sam Elliott, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Ricky Jay, and Molly Parker. It was filmed in British Columbia, Canada.

<doc id="691488" wikidata="Q999708" url="?curid=691488" title="Buckie">
<text>Buckie () is a burgh town (defined as such in 1888) on the Moray Firth coast of Scotland. Historically in Banffshire, Buckie was the largest town in the county until the administrative area was abolished in 1975. The town is the third largest in the Moray council area after Elgin and Forres and within the definitions of statistics published by the General Register Office for Scotland was ranked at number 75 in the list of population estimates for settlements in Scotland mid-year 2006. Buckie is virtually equidistant to Banff to the east and Elgin to the west, with both approximately distant whilst Keith lies to the south by road.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name of the town is not entirely clear. Although the folk etymology is that Buckie is named after a seashell (genus &quot;buccinum&quot;) the shared marine background is most likely a coincidence. The name Buckie would not have originally identified a place immediately adjacent to the sea, so alternative etymological sources are more likely. Unfortunately, in one of the earlier books on Scottish place names, Buckie on the Moray Firth does not receive a mention. However, a Buckie in the Balquhidder district of Perthshire is described as being derived from the Gaelic word &quot;boc&quot; or Welsh &quot;bowk&quot;, both meaning a buck or male deer. This suggests the meaning of Buckie as &quot;place where male deer gather&quot;, possibly referring to the valley of what is known today as the Buckie Burn.

==History==

A 1936 article by a Dr Cramond discusses the earliest mention of Buckie dating from 1362, when the lands of &quot;Rove Bucky in le Awne&quot; were leased by John Hay to John Young, vicar of Fordyce. The Hays, from whom the Rannes family were descended, had acquired through Royal favour a footing in the district at a still earlier age when the greater part from the Deveron to the Spey was embraced in the Forest of Awne or Ainie (now Enzie) and the Boyne. Rove Bucky is far from understandable and could be a scribe&#x27;s error and should perhaps read Over Bucky as occurs in older title deeds, in distinction to Nether Buckie. It has been spelt in different ways, Robert Burns calling it Bucky in his song &quot;Lady Onlie - Honest Lucky&quot; as was common at the end of the 18th century.

Robert Gordon&#x27;s map &quot;Aberdeen, Banf, Murrey &amp;c. to Inverness: [and] Fra the north water to Ross&quot;, which is dated at some time between 1636 and 1652, shows Buckie in its own right as a community some small distance from the coast with the community of Freuchny sitting nearer the shore to the north. Robert Gordon and Joan Blaeu&#x27;s &quot;Duo Vicecomitatus Aberdonia &amp; Banfia, una cum Regionibus &amp; terrarum tractibus sub iis comprehensis&quot; published in Amsterdam 1654 clearly shows Buckie and Freuchny with the addition of Nether Buckie. James Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Topographical and military map of the counties of Aberdeen, Banff and Kincardine&quot;, London, 1822 seems geographically inaccurate in its relative positioning of Buckie, Nether Buckie and Freuchny, but is significant in that the new label of Rotten Slough is given equal importance in terms of size of community with Buckie; however, in &quot;Thomson’s Atlas of Scotland&quot;, Edinburgh, 1832 Rotten Slough is fairly unimportant by size so one of these two reference publications is distorted, probably the former. This community, which would later come to be known as Portessie, was reportedly formed when &quot;Porteasie...became a fishing station in 1727, when 5 houses were built by the proprietor of Rannes for the accommodation of the original fishers from Findhorn&quot;. The 1731 Rathven Session Minutes shows that Rotten Slough had a population of 40 with ten households while the 1791 entry records 177 persons in 44 households.

By the time of the publication of the 1891 First Series Ordnance Survey Map of Elgin, which reflects the 1866-1870 survey, Buckie has developed markedly with areas named Seatown, Newtown, Ianstown and Portessie. The 19th century OS Six Inch series further shows Gordonsburgh, Craig Bow and Strathlene. The 1910 OS 3rd Edition one-inch map of Elgin has settled on the name of Ianstown and all other parts of Buckie are named as they are known today but then, just to confuse the issue, the Bartholomew Survey Atlas of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1912 uses the label &quot;Ianston&quot;. The conflicting nomenclature continued with the issue of the 1929 OS One-inch Popular edition and the 1933 JG Bartholomew &amp; Son, Half-inch to the Mile maps of Scotland.

==Geography==
The town lies on the Moray coast, around five miles east of the mouth of the River Spey. On the eastern side it largely comes to an end against the Freuchny burn, whilst the more central Buckie Burn divides Buckie and Buckpool. Buckie comprises numerous former separate fishing villages, each of which retain their own name and character. Buckie itself is the central part of the community lying between the Victoria Bridge under which flows the Buckie Burn at the western end of West Church Street, the eastern end of Cluny Harbour and above the shore area. West of the Buckie Burn is Buckpool, which was formerly known as Nether Buckie, and on the shoreline, west of Cluny Harbour, there is the Yardie. Immediately above the Yardie on the Buckie side of the burn is Seatown. To the west of the Yardie is Harbourhead. To the east of Cluny Harbour lie Ianstown, Gordonsburgh and Portessie also known locally as &quot;The Sloch&quot; (historically &quot;The Rotten Slough&quot;), which reaches towards Strathlene. 

===Climate===
==Population and demography==
The 2021 UK Census reported that, from Buckie&#x27;s total population, 84.2% were born in Scotland with the largest single minority being those born in England (9.76%). In terms of declared ethnicity, the largest was &quot;White Scottish&quot;, at 84.25%.


==Politics==

===National governments===
Formerly part of the Moray constituency from 1983 to 2024, Buckie is now in the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency for the UK Parliament, which returned the SNP MP Seamus Logan as its Member of Parliament in the 2024 General Election. 
Buckie is in the Banffshire and Buchan Coast constituency of the Scottish Parliament. The seat was represented by SNP MSP Stewart Stevenson from 2011 until 2021 and by SNP MSP Karen Adam since the Scottish Parliament election of 2021. The constituency is also part of the North East Scotland electoral region.

===Local government===
Following the reorganisation of local government in Scotland, Buckie now has a multi-member ward with 3 councillors.

Additionally, there is the Buckie Community Council, which allows for 12 members to be elected or co-opted.

==Transport==

===Road===
Buckie is situated near the A98 primary road, which connects Fraserburgh with Fochabers at the junction of the A96. The A98 runs east–west, approximately parallel with the southern edge of Buckie. The A942 starts at &quot;The Toll Bar&quot; and runs due north from the A98 into Buckie becoming High Street and then North High Street before swinging east as Low Street, along the harbour as Commercial Road and onwards as Rathburn Street, Reidhaven Street and finally Great Eastern Road out of town towards Findochty and Portknockie. Where the A942 swings east, the A990 commences to the west and heads past The Yardie and onwards as Main Street and then Great Western Road towards Portgordon. The nearest railway station is at Keith serving the Aberdeen-Inverness line. Bus services operate to Aberdeen, Macduff and Elgin. A connecting service to Keith railway station was withdrawn when Moray Council funding ceased in September 2013, but it resumed in 2022 following local pressure.

===Golden Age of the Railway===
Historically, Buckie had extensive rail connections with the rest of North East Scotland. The Great North of Scotland Railway was laid out in the 1850s and served the Aberdeen to Inverness route until it was decommissioned in the late 1960s. This construction did not reach the coast until Nairn and various branch lines were built to link the peripheral areas to the mainline service.

In 1923, GNSR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway before that itself was nationalised along with all other UK rail services into British Rail in 1948.

The Moray Coast Railway was also constructed by GNSR and the part of it that served Buckie, opening in 1886, ran from Cairnie near Keith down to the coast at Portsoy and then swung west through Cullen, Portknockie and Findochty reaching its first stop in Buckie at Portessie. This station was built directly on top of the cliff and commanded panoramic views over the Strathlene House Hotel, Strathlene outdoor swimming pool and beach and onward to the offshore rocks of Craigenroan and the Moray Firth. Indeed, a footpath led from the station down to the hotel and beach area and a visit to Strathlene was a popular day out by train before and during World War II. In 1936 Buckie Town Council proposed to change the name of the station to Strathlene but LNER declined suggesting instead that the Town Council erect their own large sign on Strathlene Golf Course that could be seen from the train. A retired passenger carriage was available for rent at the station. to the west was Buckie Station, which was located below the cliff and virtually across the street from Buckie Fish Market. To reach Buckie Station the railway gently descended to the west from the heights of Portessie on an embankment to the foot of the cliff whilst the parallel road lying adjacent to the track on its southern flank rose to the west up the &quot;McLaren&#x27;s Brae&quot; end of East Church Street to the town centre. further west stood Buckpool Station and from there the line continued due west to Portgordon and onward to Spey Bay before crossing the River Spey and swinging inland to rejoin the mainline service at Elgin. Buckie was served by these three railway stations until 1968 when the line was finally closed.

It is possible to walk, or cycle along the route of the old railway from Cullen to Garmouth. This walk takes in the magnificent Cullen viaduct from which fine views of that town can be had and, at the other end, the Spey Bridge.
Portessie was also terminus to the Buckie and Portessie Branch of the Highland Railway. This line was opened in 1884 and provided a direct rail link &quot;up the hill&quot; to Keith. The line ran westwards from Portessie but remained on top of the cliff, passing the Pot O&#x27; Linn, skirting the rear of Cliff Terrace and crossing Harbour Street then swinging south contributing to the curve of Mill Crescent to stop at Buckie Highland Station before continuing up present day Millbank Terrace towards Rathven. Until recent years this latter section was used as a footpath and commonly known as &quot;The Highland Line&quot; – it was quite possible to cycle from Millbank Terrace to the site of Rathven Station as late as the 1970s and even early 1980s – but housing development and farming interests have contributed to the virtual closure of this popular route to Peter Fair Park. The line passed under a road bridge of what is now the A98, which has long since been demolished, and then turned westwards again towards Drybridge and made another sweep to the south as it passed Enzie and then headed uphill, over the Enzie Braes, to Aultmore and on to Keith. This link was relatively short-lived and was closed in 1915 except for a freight service between Buckie and Portessie, which was closed in 1944.

==As a port==
The industrial centre of Buckie is based around Cluny Harbour. This port was built by the Cluny family in 1877 to replace the town&#x27;s first stone harbour in Nether Buckie, which was constructed in 1857 west but had a tendency to silt up and become unusable. The Laird of Letterfourie contributed £5,000 of the construction costs at Nether Buckie but the main investor with the balance of £10,000 was the Board of Fisheries. The engineers were D.&amp; T. Stevenson of Edinburgh, the family firm of the author Robert Louis Stevenson. It was and remains a very sturdily built edifice with the main walls of considerable thickness being built of quartzite, quarried locally at Strathlene, capped with a very hard type of sandstone, which was also used to form the walls at the entrance and of the harbour proper. As regards stability the harbour has remained a monument to engineering science with very little maintenance ever being necessary. It had a design fault, however, in that the entrance opened to the northeast and was subject to infill with shingle, moving westwards by longshore drift. Later known as Buckpool Harbour, this earlier port became something of an eyesore and eventually the silted basin became overgrown and dangerously swampy. The decision was taken to fill in the basin and this work was undertaken in the 1970s. The resulting park includes a pebble beach and the original quartzite harbour walls remain completely intact. Cluny Harbour was built by the Cluny family in 1877 at a cost of £60,000: at the time it was one of the finest harbours in Scotland.

==Industry==
Although Buckie was once a thriving fishing and shipbuilding port, these industries have declined. Though Peterhead and Aberdeen are now more often associated with the fishing industry in northeast Scotland, in 1913 Buckie had the largest steam drifter fleet in Scotland. Food processing remains important, with large fish factories and smoke houses found around the harbour. Buckie can properly be regarded as one of the main points of origin of the modern Scottish shellfish industry. A Mancunian, Charles Eckersley, who moved to Buckie in the 1950s and started trading as a fish merchant, noticed that shellfish such as prawns and scallops were regarded as economically useless by Buckie fishing vessels but were the same species that he had enjoyed whilst completing his National Service in Palestine. He seized the opportunity to exploit this gap in the market and he built a thriving processing and packing business.

The Buckie Shipyard now repairs and refits RNLI lifeboats for much of the United Kingdom and operates service contracts for various other clients including the MoD as well as building new vessels but boatbuilding was a major industry in the town for decades. Until recent years there were three separate boatyards building traditional wooden clinker fishing vessels. Heading down North High Street, the view of the sea would have been interrupted by a huge grey corrugated iron shed. This was Thomsons, from which vessels were launched directly into the Moray Firth from a slipway. Heading east to Cluny Harbour was Herd and Mackenzie on the fourth or &quot;lifeboat&quot; basin of the harbour. Directly behind their large sheds and across Blantyre Terrace was Jones with their private harbour into which they launched their vessels. Thomsons is gone but the premises of Herd and McKenzie and Jones are part of the modern day Buckie Shipyard. It was Herd and McKenzie, a firm with its roots in Dunbartonshire from where Messrs Herd and Mackenzie sortied north, which built and launched the training schooner &quot;Captain Scott&quot; in 1972. At the time of its launch, this vessel was the largest of its type in the world. In earlier years, there were further boat construction operations dotted along the shoreline from The Yardie to Ianstown and on to Portessie but these had mostly been amalgamated into the three main firms or had gone out of business by the interwar period.

A significant part of the population works in the offshore oil industry although Buckie somewhat missed the boat with the North Sea boom. In the late 1970s, there were extensive plans drawn up to extend Cluny Harbour out to the Mucks reef with the intention of serving oilfield supply vessels. Nothing came of this but every now and then the idea rears its head once more to be met with great enthusiasm before failing to get off the ground again.

Buckie was home to a specialist electric lamp factory of Thorn EMI until 1987 when it was closed and production moved to a new plant in Leicestershire. All of the predominantly female staff were offered jobs at the new facility in the East Midlands but, as the vast majority of the labour force were second wage earners in families, this offer was almost universally rejected.

Buckie is home to the Inchgower Distillery, which sits or so inland from the town and is best known for the Inchgower Single Malt.

==Religion==

As a traditional fishing community, Buckie had an active religious life, and thus has numerous churches representing almost every branch of Northern European Christianity. The largest church is St. Peter&#x27;s, which stands on St. Andrews Square in Buckpool. This twin-spired red sandstone construction was originally planned to act as the cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen when it was opened in 1857. This never came to pass and Buckie was left with what is arguably one of the grandest churches in NE Scotland outside of Aberdeen. The basis of this reasoning was that the Roman Catholic population per capita in the area around Buckie was one of the highest in post-Reformation Scotland. St. Gregory&#x27;s, built at Preshome near Buckie in 1788, was the first post-Reformation church to be built in Scotland that looked like a church – prior to that date post-Reformation Roman Catholics worshiped in clandestine churches designed to look anonymous. These sometimes resembled farm buildings or ordinary houses, a superbly preserved example of this is St. Ninian&#x27;s (1775) at Tynet about to the west of Buckie, which looks like a long, low barn.
The largest Church of Scotland congregation in the town worships in the North Church in Cluny Square. This building houses the town clock and was opened in 1879. There are other Church of Scotland congregations in addition to Methodist, Salvation Army, Episcopal, Baptist, Gospel Hall Brethren, Church of Christ and other congregational churches.

==Schools==
Buckie High School is located on West Cathcart Street. Examination results are in line with those of young people with similar needs and backgrounds in other schools across Scotland.

There are four primary schools in Buckie - Cluny Primary School (Buckie Primary School until 1974) which is directly opposite the old building of the high school, Millbank Primary School on McWilliam Crescent off High Street, St. Peter&#x27;s RC Primary School in Buckpool and Portessie Primary School. Additional primary schools in Portgordon, Findochty, Portknockie and Cullen contribute to the roll of Buckie High School. The surrounding villages of Arradoul, Drybridge, Rathven and Lintmill, most of which once had their own schools, now send students to Buckie High School and nearby primary schools. The adjoining school areas are Banff, Keith and Fochabers.

==Leisure==
Buckie has two golf courses, at the eastern and western peripheries. To the eastern extremity lies Strathlene Golf Course, which stretches almost all the way to the village of Findochty; while to the west lies Buckpool Golf Club, which reaches towards the village of Portgordon.

Adjacent to Buckie High School is Victoria Park, home of Buckie Thistle Football Club. Although &quot;The Jags&quot; were consistently high finishers in the Highland Football League, the league title had eluded the club for decades until 2010, when an away win at Wick Academy F.C. sealed a first championship in 52 years. The championship was retained in 2011 in the last match of the season, with Buckie scoring the winner in the final minute. Since then the club has won the league twice more, in 2017 and 2024. The 1950s was a decade when all trophies available were regularly won. During this era Buckie Thistle travelled to Hampden Park to meet Queen&#x27;s Park in a Scottish Cup 4th round replay on 30 October 1954, winning 2–1, becoming the first and, to this day, only senior non-league club to have won a competitive match at the national stadium. The board has developed the stadium in recent years, adding a function hall so that sponsors and match-goers can enjoy licensed and catering facilities. 

In Buckpool, next door to Buckpool Golf Club, is Merson Park, home of Buckie Rovers Football Club. &quot;The Rovers&quot; are members of the Scottish Junior Football Association and play in that body&#x27;s North First Division (East). At one time they played at Victoria Park, alternating home fixtures with their senior cousins but when Buckie Thistle were suffering an episode of extreme financial distress the decision was taken to move to a new facility at the municipal Merson Park. The Merson Park ground has only a perimeter fence and dugouts differentiating it from a municipal pitch and there are no covered or seated facilities.

Near the southern edge of town on High Street lies Linzee Gordon Park. This is home to Buckie Cricket Club, which has a very long history with numerous Macallan North of Scotland Cricket Association League titles (having last topped the league in 2018) on top of various league and cup wins in the 1990s including two wins in the Scottish Cricket Union Small Clubs Cup. The club built a modern pavilion to replace their aging home, which opened in June 1998. The construction was partly funded by sportscotland and the National Lottery. Linzee Gordon Park also has a municipal pavilion along with a pitch for football use.

Buckie has two bowling greens. Buckie Bowling Club is on North High Street and Low Street with views over the Moray Firth from the clubhouse. Buckie Victoria Bowling Club is at the end of West Church Street, near the Buckpool bridge. The town also has a 25m swimming pool next to Buckie High School, which opened in 1975.

Buckie is at the end of the Speyside Way long-distance footpath. There are &quot;marvellous landscapes&quot; all along the Banff coast, with easy access to areas such as Glenlivet, Speyside and the Cairngorms.

<doc id="691522" wikidata="Q7344907" url="?curid=691522" title="Robert Grainger Ker Thompson">
<text>Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson (1916–1992) was a British military officer and counter-insurgency expert who &quot;was widely regarded on both sides of the Atlantic as the world&#x27;s leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency&quot;. His 1966 book &quot;Defeating Communist Insurgency&quot; played an important role in popularizing the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; approach to counterinsurgency.

==Biography==

Thompson was the son of Canon W. G. Thompson. He went to Marlborough College and took an MA at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he joined the University Air Squadron learning to fly. He was commissioned into the Royal Air Force Reserve in 1936. In 1938, he joined the Malayan Civil Service as a cadet.

At the start of World War II, Thomson joined the RAF, and was serving in Macao when the Japanese attacked. He escaped the Japanese and with a suitcase full of money and a knowledge of Cantonese, he gambled his way across China to Burma.

He was a liaison officer with the Chindits in the Burma Campaign, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross (the latter an unusual decoration for an RAF officer, since it is normally awarded to those serving in the British Army). Later in the campaign, he flew Hurricanes and was promoted to the rank of Squadron Leader in 1945.

At the war&#x27;s end, he returned to the Malayan civil service, becoming assistant commissioner of labour in the state of Perak in 1946. After attending the Joint Services Staff College at Latimer and holding the local rank of lieutenant-colonel, he was a member of the staff of the British director of operations during the Malayan Emergency. He would later say that much of what he had learned about counter-insurgency operations was learned while serving under Lieutenant-General Sir Harold Briggs and his replacement, General Sir Gerald Templer.

In 1959, (after Malayan independence), Thompson became permanent secretary for defence for Tun Abdul Razak (who later became Malayan prime minister). In response to a request from President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Malayan prime minister sent a team to South Vietnam to advise Diem on how to counter his insurgency problems. Thompson headed that team which so impressed Diem that he asked the British to second Thompson to the government South Vietnam as an advisor.

In September 1961, the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan appointed Thompson head of the newly established BRIAM (British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam) and - by extension - to Washington. Thompson conceived of an initiative he called the Delta Plan, but when he saw the effects of the strategic hamlets initiative, begun in February 1962, he became an enthusiastic backer, telling President Kennedy in 1963 that he felt the war could be won. Under Thompson&#x27;s leadership, BRIAM put economic pressure on the South Vietnamese government that Thompson described as a &quot;straight invitation to a coup&quot;.

Kennedy was receptive to Thompson&#x27;s ideas, but the American military establishment were extremely reluctant to implement them. His warning not to bomb villages went unheeded and his dismissal of American air supremacy was ignored. &quot;The war [will] be won by brains and on foot&quot;, he told Kennedy, but competing interests in Washington and Saigon acted to marginalise Thompson and ultimately his strategies had no real effect on the conflict. He stepped down from BRIAM in 1965 and the organisation, deprived of the man who was essentially its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;, folded up around him.

Thompson subsequently worked as a consultant for the Rand Corporation. Despite his relatively acrimonious criticism of United States policy in Vietnam, Thompson returned to a post assisting the American government in November 1969 when he became a special adviser on &quot;pacification&quot; to President Nixon. Following a visit to South Vietnam. Thompson advised Nixon that the South Vietnamese government was winning the war and would continue to do so unless Vietnamization proceeded too quickly. 

In later life, Thompson wrote extensively about the use of commandos and counter-insurgency operations in asymmetric warfare.

==Defeating Communist Insurgency: Experiences in Malaysia and Vietnam==

Certain basic principles of counter-insurgency warfare have been well known since the 1950s and 1960s. The widely distributed and influential work of Sir Robert Thompson offers several such guidelines. Thompson&#x27;s underlying assumption is that of a country minimally committed to the rule of law and better governance.

Elements of Thompson&#x27;s moderate approach are adapted here:

# The people are the key base to be secured and defended rather than territory won or enemy bodies counted. Contrary to the focus of conventional warfare, territory gained or casualty counts are not of overriding importance in counter-guerrilla warfare. The support of the population is the key variable. Since many insurgents rely on the population for recruits, food, shelter, financing, and other materials, the counter-insurgent force must focus its efforts on providing physical and economic security for that population and defending it against insurgent attacks and propaganda.
# There must be a clear political counter-vision that can overshadow, match or neutralize the guerrilla vision. This can range from granting political autonomy to economic development measures in the affected region. The vision must be an integrated approach, involving political, social and economic and media influence measures. A nationalist narrative, for example, might be used in one situation, an ethnic autonomy approach in another. An aggressive media campaign must also be mounted in support of the competing vision or the counter-insurgent regime will appear weak or incompetent. 
# Practical action must be taken at the lower levels to match the competitive political vision. It may be tempting for the counter-insurgent side simply to declare guerrillas &quot;terrorists&quot; and pursue a harsh liquidation strategy. Brute force, however, may not be successful in the long run. Action does not mean capitulation, but sincere steps such as removing corrupt or arbitrary officials, cleaning up fraud, building more infrastructure, collecting taxes honestly, or addressing other legitimate grievances can do much to undermine the guerrillas&#x27; appeal.
# Economy of force. The counter-insurgent regime must not overreact to guerrilla provocations, since this may indeed be what they seek in order to create a crisis in civilian morale. Indiscriminate use of firepower may only serve to alienate the key focus of counter-insurgency - the base of the people. Police level actions should guide the effort and take place in a clear framework of legality, even if under a State of Emergency. Civil liberties and other customs of peacetime may have to be suspended, but again, the counter-insurgent regime must exercise restraint, and cleave to orderly procedures. In the counter-insurgency context, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; are even more important than technological prowess and massive firepower, although anti-guerrilla forces should take full advantage of modern air, artillery and electronic warfare assets.
# Big unit action may sometimes be necessary. If police action is not sufficient to stop the guerrilla fighters, military sweeps may be necessary. Such &quot;big battalion&quot; operations may be needed to break up significant guerrilla concentrations and split them into small groups where combined civic-police action can control them.
# Aggressive mobility. Mobility and aggressive small unit action is extremely important for the counter-insurgent regime. Heavy formations must be lightened aggressively to locate, pursue and neutralise insurgent units. Huddling in static strongpoints simply concedes the field to the insurgents. They must be kept on the run constantly with aggressive patrols, raids, ambushes, sweeps, cordons, roadblocks, prisoner snatches, etc.
# Ground level embedding and integration. In tandem with mobility is the embedding of hardcore counter-insurgent units or troops with local security forces and civilian elements. The US Marines in Vietnam also saw some success with this method, under its CAP (Combined Action Program) where Marines were teamed as both trainers and &quot;stiffeners&quot; of local elements on the ground. US Special Forces in Vietnam, like the Green Berets, also caused significant local problems for their opponents by their leadership and integration with mobile tribal and irregular forces. The CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division created successful guerrilla forces from the Hmong tribe during the war in Vietnam in the 1960s, from the Northern Alliance against the Taliban during the war in Afghanistan in 2001, and from the Kurdish Peshmerga against Ansar al-Islam and the forces of Saddam Hussein during the war in Iraq in 2003. In Iraq, the 2007 US &quot;surge&quot; strategy saw the embedding of regular and special forces troops among Iraqi army units. These hardcore groups were also incorporated into local neighborhood outposts in a bid to facilitate intelligence gathering, and to strengthen ground level support among the masses.
# Cultural sensitivity. Counter-insurgent forces require familiarity with the local culture, mores and language or they will experience numerous difficulties. Americans experienced this in Vietnam and during the US invasion of Iraqi and occupation, where shortages of Arabic speaking interpreters and translators hindered both civil and military operations.
# Systematic intelligence effort. Every effort must be made to gather and organize useful intelligence. A systematic process must be set up to do so, from casual questioning of civilians to structured interrogations of prisoners. Creative measures must also be used, including the use of double agents, or even bogus &quot;liberation&quot; or sympathizer groups that help reveal insurgent personnel or operations.
# Methodical clear and hold. An &quot;ink spot&quot; clear and hold strategy must be used by the counter-insurgent regime, dividing the conflict area into sectors, and assigning priorities between them. Control must expand outward like an ink spot on paper, systematically neutralizing and eliminating the insurgents in one sector of the grid, before proceeding to the next. It may be necessary to pursue holding or defensive actions elsewhere, while priority areas are cleared and held.
# Careful deployment of mass popular forces and special units. Mass forces include village self-defense groups and citizen militias organized for community defense and can be useful in providing civic mobilization and local security. Specialist units can be used profitably, including commando squads, long range reconnaissance and &quot;hunter-killer&quot; patrols, defectors who can track or persuade their former colleagues like the Kit Carson units in Vietnam, and paramilitary style groups.
# The limits of foreign assistance must be clearly defined and carefully used. Such aid should be limited either by time, or as to material and technical, and personnel support, or both. While outside aid or even troops can be helpful, lack of clear limits, in terms of either a realistic plan for victory or exit strategy, may find the foreign helper &quot;taking over&quot; the local war, and being sucked into a lengthy commitment, thus providing the guerrillas with valuable propaganda opportunities as the toll of dead foreigners mounts. Such a scenario occurred with the US in Vietnam, with the American effort creating dependence in South Vietnam, and war-weariness and protests back home. Heavy-handed foreign interference may also fail to operate effectively within the local cultural context, setting up conditions for failure.
# Time. A key factor in guerrilla strategy is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down the will of the opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow enough time to get the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play into the hands of the guerrillas, though it is equally important to recognize when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.

<doc id="691525" wikidata="Q6284368" url="?curid=691525" title="Joseph Jekyll">
<text>Sir Joseph Jekyll (166319 August 1738), of Westminster, was a British barrister, judge and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons for 40 years from 1697 to 1738. He became Master of the Rolls in 1717.

==Early life and career as a barrister==
Jekyll was born in 1663 to John Jekyll of the Fishmonger&#x27;s Company and alderman, of St Stephen Walbrook, London, and his second wife Tryphena. He was the half-brother of Thomas Jekyll. He attended a non-conformist seminary in Islington before being admitted to the Middle Temple in 1680. He was called to the Bar in 1687. Thanks to his connections with Middle Temple he became an associate of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Somers, and later married Somers&#x27; sister, Elizabeth. With Somers&#x27; support he became Chief Justice of Cheshire in June 1697, succeeding John Coombe, and was knighted on 12 December of that year. In 1699 he became a Reader of Middle Temple. In 1700 he became a Serjeant-at-Law, in 1702 a King&#x27;s Serjeant and finally Prime Serjeant in 1714. Jekyll was very active in bringing cases before the House of Lords, acting in 14 cases in 1706 alone.

==Political career==
Jekyll was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Eye at a by-election on 14 December 1697 and was returned again in the following year at the 1698 English general election. He was seen as part of the Whig Junto . He was extremely active in parliament and an excellent speaker. He played a role in drafting various bills and acts. Occasionally he voted against the party, mainly because he supported greater reform of the electoral system and the removal of bribery and corruption. He was returned unopposed for Eye in the two general elections of 1701 and in 1702 and 1705. Returned again at the 1708 British general election he was involved in the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell in 1709 and 1710. He was returned again for Eye at the 1710 British general election but at the 1713 British general election was returned instead for Lymington. 

At the 1715 British general election Jekyll was returned again for Lymington. He was asked to participate in the secret committee tasked with preparing the impeachment of the Earl of Oxford and the Duke of Ormonde, which he refused to support. He persuaded the government to open an investigation into the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720. At the 1722 British general election 
he was returned as MP for Reigate where he was returned again in 1727 and 1734. He sponsored the Mortmain Act 1735 (9 Geo. 2. c. 36) and the Gin Act 1736, and was noted for his opposition to intoxication, which annoyed the public so much that he was forced to have a guard at his house at all times. Under Robert Walpole he remained independent of the government in terms of how he voted, and was described by Alexander Pope as &quot;an odd old Whig, who never change his principles or wig&quot;. 

Outside Parliament, Jekyll provided £600 to fund the colony at Jekyll Island, and as a result James Oglethorpe named the island in the Province of Georgia after him.

==Master of the Rolls==
On 13 July 1717, Jekyll was appointed Master of the Rolls, and the same year became a Privy Councillor. His time as Master &quot;was distinguished by legal ability, integrity and despatch&quot;, and during this period he helped write &quot;The Judicial Authority of the Master of the Rolls&quot;. He was given the Great Seal on 7 January 1725, and held it until 1 June. 

==Death and legacy==

On 19 August 1738 he died of &quot;a mortification in the bowels&quot;, and was buried in the Rolls Chapel. He had no children. In his will he left £20,000 to help pay off the national debt, something Lord Mansfield described as &quot;a very foolish bequest... he might as well have attempted to stop the middle arch of Blackfriars Bridge with his full-bottomed wig&quot;.

Jekyll Island is named in his honor.

<doc id="691531" wikidata="Q267559" url="?curid=691531" title="Eija-Liisa Ahtila">
<text>Eija-Liisa Ahtila (born 1959 in Hämeenlinna, Finland) is a contemporary visual artist and filmmaker who lives and works in Helsinki.

Ahtila is most known for her multi-panel cinematic installations. She experiments with narrative storytelling in her films and cinematic installations. In her earlier works, she dealt with the topic of unsettling human dramas at the center of personal relationships, dealing with teenage sexuality, family relationships, mental disintegration, and death. Her later works, however, pursue more profound artistic questions where she investigates the processes of perception and attribution of meaning, at times in the light of larger cultural and existential themes, like colonialism, faith and posthumanism.

Ahtila has participated in numerous international art exhibitions such as Manifesta (1998), the Venice Biennale (1999 and 2005), &quot;documenta&quot; 11 (2002), São Paulo Art Biennial (2008) and the Sydney Biennale in 2002 and 2018.

Ahtila has won several art and film awards, including the inaugural Vincent Award (2000), Artes Mundi (2006), Prince Eugen Medal (2008), and most recently Art Academic in Finland (2009).

Her work is held in the collections of the Tate and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is a former professor at the Department of Time and Space-based Art at the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts (Finland).

==Artistic career==
Writing in the journal &quot;PAJ&quot;, Jane Philbrick describes Ahtila&#x27;s films as &quot;Smart, emotionally arresting, engaging, affective.&quot; Philbrick continues, saying, &quot;A self-described &#x27;teller of human dramas&#x27;, she approaches narrative equipped with a rigorous arsenal of postmodern strategies ... One of her most potent tools, however, is a two-centuries-old dramatic genre of proven emotional reach and punch, melodrama.&quot; Although done in a more sophisticated way than conventional melodramas, Ahtila&#x27;s work likewise exaggerates plots and characters to affect the viewer&#x27;s emotions, with less appeal to immediate intellectual comprehension.

In 1993, Ahtila created the three mini-films &quot;Me/We, Okay, and Gray&quot;: Each of these 90-second mini-films was shown separately and as a trilogy, as trailers in cinemas, on television during commercial breaks and in art galleries. Ahtila explores questions of identity and group relations through her use of narrative conventions derived from film, television and advertising. In &quot;Me/We&quot; the father of a family speaks about his family in a monologue and other players mouth his words. When the father speaks about his family members&#x27; emotions, their personalities mix together and become inseparable.
In &quot;Okay&quot; a woman is speaking about violence in man and woman relationship and as she steps across the room like a tiger in a cage, her voice goes up and shows pure violence.
In &quot;Gray&quot; three women in a lift go down into the water and talk about the atomic explosion and its effects, while words and pictures mix identity crisis and an atomic disaster.

In 2002, Ahtila created a film called &quot;The House&quot;, for which she performed research that included conducting interviews with people who are afflicted by psychotic mental disorders. The film begins with a woman driving to a secluded house, and as events continue they take on a dreamlike state. The sounds become disorienting and the images begin to combine: the woman can see the car on the walls of the house; she hears boat horns that make no sense. The film is meant to be presented in an exhibit that displays each of the three screens on separate walls, making the viewer feel as if they are actually in the house where the project was filmed.

In 2002 she had a solo show at Tate Modern, and in 2006 her multi-screen video piece &quot;The Wind&quot; (2006) was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). She has also had solo shows at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the Parasol Unit in London, ACMI in Melbourne and DHC/ART in Montreal.

Among Ahtila&#x27;s many other works is &quot;The Hour of Prayer&quot;, first presented in 2005 at the Venice Biennale in Italy. The film is a four-channel video project that shows scenes from a woman&#x27;s experience surrounding the death of her dog. Bridget Goodbody, writing for &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, says that it presents &quot;a nonnarrative cycle of apparently random, but nonetheless consequential scenes.&quot; Some of those scenes show how, when she was away from her dog, he fell through the ice of a frozen pond, breaking his leg. Another shows the dog brought to a veterinarian for treatment of the injury; a diagnosis of bone cancer is made. After the dog dies, the film presents scenes of the woman moving on with her life, living as an artist in Africa.

Another of her films, which debuted in 2009, is &quot;Where is Where?&quot;. New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, which housed the seven-day exhibition, called it, &quot;a haunting and layered consideration of how history affects our perception of reality.&quot; In the film, a present-day poet, with the assistance of a figure who is the personification of death, investigates a murder committed fifty years ago. Two young Arab boys had killed their French friend during the Algerian War of Independence. As the poet investigates, images from the past and present begin to mix and collide; at one point the poet discovers the two boys seated in a boat, in the small swimming pool behind his house.

In 2011 Ahtila&#x27;s exhibition &quot;horizontal&quot; first showed at the Marian Goodman Gallery. This piece is a 6 projection instillation showing a pine tree. Each projection shows a different part of the tree. Ahtila distorts the pine tree with tilts of the camera and different coloring for each projection.

Although Ahtila&#x27;s films do include more than one character, they tend to focus on the internal experience of just one person. Her work seems to be more about studying and understanding an individual&#x27;s subjective experience, and how the influences around individuals shape who they are and what they do, and shape their unconscious selves. She is greatly interested in the factors that go into the construction of personal identity, and in how fluid that construct can be. Ahtila wants to explore, as she says, &quot;how the subconscious is inherited in some way,&quot; citing as an example, &quot;[the way] in which my mother is physically present in myself and I am present in her.&quot;

<doc id="691541" wikidata="Q1998273" url="?curid=691541" title="Ingrian Finns">
<text>The Ingrians (, ; ), sometimes called Ingrian Finns, are the Finnish population of Ingria (now the central part of Leningrad Oblast in Russia), descending from Lutheran Finnish immigrants introduced into the area in the 17th century, when Finland and Ingria were both parts of the Swedish Empire. Before and after World War II, most of them were relocated to other parts of the Soviet Union or killed, in a Soviet campaign of forced deportations and the genocide. Today the Ingrian Finns constitute the largest part of the Finnish population of the Russian Federation. According to some records, some 25,000 Ingrian Finns have returned or still reside in the region of Saint Petersburg.

==History==

===Origins===

Ingrian Finns are the indigenous minority of Europe.
Finnish-speaking Ingrians are not to be confused with Izhorian-speaking Ingrians. Ingrian Finns mainly consist of two groups: &quot;Savakot&quot;, who originated from migrant Savonians; and &quot;Äyrämöiset&quot;, coming from the Karelian Isthmus (mostly from Äyräpää), then parts of the Swedish realm. They were Lutheran settlers and migrant workers who moved to Ingria during the period of Swedish rule 1617–1703. Others originated from more or less voluntary conversion among the indigenous Finnic-speaking Votes and Izhorians, where approved by the Swedish authorities. Finns made up 41.1 percent of the population of Ingria in 1656, 53.2 percent in 1661, 55.2 percent in 1666, 56.9 percent in 1671 and 73.8 percent in 1695.

After the Russian conquest and the foundation of Saint Petersburg (1703), the flow of migration was reversed. Russian nobles were granted land in Ingria, and Lutheran Ingrian Finns left Ingria, where they were in minority, for the area known as Old Finland, north of the Gulf of Finland, which Russia had gained from Sweden during the 18th century, and where Lutherans were a large majority. There in Finnish Karelia the Ingrian Finns assimilated with the Karelian Finns.

===Developments in the 19th century===
In 1870, the printing of the first Finnish-language newspaper, &quot;Pietarin Sanomat&quot;, started in Ingria. Before that Ingria received newspapers mostly from Vyborg. The first public library was opened in 1850, in Tyrö. The largest of the libraries, situated in Skuoritsa, had more than 2,000 volumes in the second half of the 19th century. In 1899, the first song festival in Ingria was held in Puutosti (Skuoritsa).

By 1897, the number of Ingrian Finns had grown to 130,413, and by 1917 it exceeded 140,000 (45,000 in Northern Ingria, 52,000 in Central (Eastern) Ingria and 30,000 in Western Ingria, the rest in Petrograd).

===Ingrians in the Soviet Union===

Soviet rule, and the German occupation (1941–1944) during World War II, were as disastrous for the Ingrian Finns as for other small ethnic groups. Many Ingrian Finns were either executed, deported to Siberia, or forced to relocate to other parts of the Soviet Union. There were also refugees to Finland, where they assimilated.

After the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, Ingrian Finns inhabiting the southern part of the Karelian Isthmus seceded from Soviet Russia and formed the independent Republic of North Ingria, which was backed by Finland. The short-lived republic was reintegrated with Soviet Russia according to the 14 October 1920 Russian-Finnish Treaty of Tartu, and for several years thereafter it retained some degree of autonomy. From 1928 to 1939, Ingrian Finns in North Ingria constituted the Kuivaisi National District with its center in Toksova and Finnish as its official language.

The First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926 recorded 114,831 &quot;Leningrad
Finns&quot;, as Ingrian Finns were then called.

In 1928, collectivization of agriculture started in Ingria. To facilitate it, in 1929–1931, 18,000 people (4,320 families) from North Ingria were deported to East Karelia or the Kola Peninsula, as well as to Kazakhstan and other parts of Central Asia. The situation for the Ingrian Finns deteriorated further because of the Soviet plan to create restricted security zones along the borders with Finland and Estonia, free of the Finnic peoples, who were considered politically unreliable. In April 1935 7,000 people (2,000 families) were deported from Ingria to Kazakhstan, elsewhere in Central Asia, and the Ural region. In May and June 1936 20,000 people, the entire Finnish population of the parishes of Valkeasaari, Lempaala, Vuole and Miikkulainen near the Finnish border, were transferred to the area around Cherepovets. In Ingria they were replaced by people from other parts of the Soviet Union.

In 1937 Lutheran churches and Finnish-language schools in Ingria were closed down, and publications and radio broadcasting in Finnish were suspended.

In March 1939 the Kuivaisi National District was liquidated.

Initially during the Winter War, the Soviet policy was mixed. On the one hand, Stalin&#x27;s government largely destroyed Ingrian Finnish culture, but on the other hand, the maintenance of a Finnish-speaking population was desired as a way to legitimize the planned occupation of Finland. The failure of the puppet Terijoki government led to the ultimate result that in 1941, Moscow officially decided that Ingrian Finns were unreliable, and in 1942 most of the Ingrian Finns remaining in Ingria were forcibly relocated to Siberia. During the Finnish and German occupation of the area, Ingrian Finns were evacuated to Finland. However, after the Continuation War, most of these Ingrian Finns, who were still Soviet citizens, were forcibly returned to the Soviet Union, where they were dispersed into Central Russia. However, some Ingrian Finns were able to flee to Sweden, and nearly 4,000 were able to remain in Finland. Ingrian Finns were largely forgotten during the presidencies of Juho Kusti Paasikivi and Urho Kekkonen.

After the war many Ingrian Finns settled in Soviet-controlled Estonia.

==Present day==

From the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 until 2010, about 25,000 Ingrian Finns moved from Russia and Estonia to Finland, where they were eligible for automatic residence permits under the Finnish Law of Return. In 2010, however, the Finnish government decided to stop the remigration, so Ingrian Finns seeking residence are now treated in the same way as any other foreigners. There are still about 15,000 people in the remigration queue.

The number of people who declared their nationality as Finnish in the 2010 Russian census was 20,000, down from 47,000 in 1989.

Many Ingrian Finns, including mixed families, who moved to Finland did not speak any language other than Russian and in many cases still identify as Russians.
There are social integration problems similar to those of any other migrant group in Europe, to such an extent that there is a political debate in Finland over the retention of the Finnish Law of Return. In contrast, native Finnish-speakers have been easily assimilated into mainstream Finnish culture, leaving little trace of Ingrian Finnish traditions.

In Estonia, the Ingrian Finns have enjoyed cultural autonomy since 2004, being the first minority to organize and use such a right after Estonia&#x27;s restoration of independence. The 2011 census counted 369 Ingrian Finns in Estonia, a large majority of whom are also citizens of Estonia.

In Russia, many Ingrian Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Ingria.

== Genetics ==
In terms of autosomal DNA, Ingrian Finns are close to Finns from Finland and other Baltic Finnic groups. About 10 percent of their admixture is Siberian.

The majority of Ingrian Finnish men belong to the paternal haplogroup N1c, which is typical for Finns and other Finno-Ugric peoples. Their second most common Y-haplogroup is I1. In terms of Y-DNA, Ingrian Finns are closest to Finns from Finland (especially Eastern Finns) and Karelians from White Karelia.

Half of Ingrian Finns belong to the maternal haplogroup H and 19.4 percent carry U5. Their other mtDNA haplogroups include T (11.1 %), V (5.6 %) and W (5.6 %).

<text>Kingswood was, from 1974 to 1996, a non-metropolitan district of the county of Avon, England.

The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974 as part of a reform of local authorities throughout England and Wales. Under the reorganisation, the area surrounding the cities of Bath and Bristol was formed into a new county of &quot;Avon&quot;, named after the river that ran through the area. The county was divided into six districts, one of which was formed from the areas of Kingswood and Mangotsfield urban districts with Warmley Rural District from the administrative county of Gloucestershire. On 20 May 1987 the district was granted borough status. 

Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the county of Avon and Borough of Kingswood were abolished on 1 April 1996. Kingswood was merged with the neighbouring Northavon district to form the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire.

<text>A flying roller coaster is a type of steel roller coaster meant to simulate the sensations of flight by harnessing riders in a prone position during the duration of the ride. The roller coaster cars are suspended below the track, with riders secured such that their backs are parallel to the track.

==History==
The flying roller coaster is a relatively new concept. The world&#x27;s first flying roller coaster was &quot;Skytrak&quot;, built in Manchester, United Kingdom at the Granada Studios Tour in 1997. The &quot;Skytrak&quot; used a single-passenger car. Riders would climb into the car in much the same fashion as climbing a ladder, then the car would be raised up to the track before being dispatched. The single-passenger design kept the ride&#x27;s capacity low, at only 240 riders per hour. The park, and &quot;Skytrak&quot; itself, were short-lived; both closed in 1998.

==Design==

===Vekoma===

Dutch roller coaster manufacturer Vekoma constructed the first large-scale flying roller coaster, &quot;Stealth&quot;, for California&#x27;s Great America in 2000. Nicknamed the &#x27;Flying Dutchman&#x27; by Vekoma, &quot;Stealth&quot; featured a higher-capacity train with four-across seating. Riders load the trains in an upright sitting position, facing the rear of the train. After the train is fully loaded, a mechanism in the station lower the seats to the track, with the riders on their backs facing the ceiling. After cresting the lift hill, the track twists 180 degrees to flip the riders into the flying position for the rest of the ride. Just prior to reaching the roller coaster&#x27;s final brake run, the track twists again, such that riders are lying on their backs facing upward. After reaching the station, the seats are raised back to loading position.
The harness system for the Vekoma flying roller coaster consists of two main elements: the lap bar and the chest harness. After being seated, the operator pulls down the lap bar, which is hinged on the floor of the train. The bar locks into slots in the sides of the seat and secures the waist. Halfway up the bar is a pair of leg restraints, which hold the legs in place during the ride. The rider then fastens the buckles to close the chest harness and secure the upper body. Hand grips are placed at the ends of the arm rests of each seat.

Vekoma would expand upon the &#x27;Flying Dutchman&#x27; prototype with two other installations in 2001, &quot;Batwing&quot; for Six Flags America and &quot;X-Flight&quot; for Geauga Lake. Of the three Vekoma Flying Dutchmans, only &quot;Batwing&quot; remains operating. &quot;Stealth&quot; was relocated to Carowinds where it operated as &quot;BORG Assimilator&quot; from 2004 to 2007, and later as &quot;Nighthawk&quot; until its closure in 2024, while &quot;X-Flight&quot; operated at Kings Island as &quot;Firehawk&quot; until its closure on October 28, 2018.

In 2009, Vekoma debuted a new, more compact flying roller coaster model nicknamed the &#x27;Stingray&#x27; which used the same seating configuration as the original Flying Dutchman, but with Vekoma&#x27;s new track style as well as a vertical lift hill. Its first installation is at the Suzhou Giant Wheel Park in Suzhou, China, which opened on August 18, 2009. The ride was removed in 2018.

In 2014, Phantasialand in Brühl, Germany contracted Vekoma to design and build a new flying roller coaster to be the center piece of a new immersive themed area of the park which would also include the park&#x27;s third hotel. Noting previous design limitations and issues with other flying coaster models, particularly in regard to capacity as loading procedures were slow and complex. Phantasialand pursued two objectives for the design of their new flying coaster; a simplified and streamlined loading process, and custom layout designed to fit in the limited space (100m by 75m) available as well as height restrictions imposed upon the park. Vekoma spent the next few years designing and testing a prototype system at its factory in Vlodrop, with construction on the new coaster beginning in 2016 and finishing in 2019. In 2019, Phantasialand began a teaser campaign for the new coaster, announcing the name F.L.Y. (Flying Launch Coaster). On September 17, 2020, F.L.Y. officially opened to the public.

F.L.Y. features a completely brand new loading procedure never before seen on any flying coaster model. Upon entering the station, the track and trains rotate from a prone position 90 degrees onto the side, while the seats, which are two abreast, rotate at the same time so that the passengers move from a prone &quot;flying&quot; position to an upright position. The passengers load into a standard seated position and pull down the over-the-shoulder vest harness. Once secure, the train is dispatched out of the station and proceeds in the upright position through a short dark ride section before the track, train, and seats rotate into the prone flying position.

In addition to the new loading procedure, F.L.Y. is also the first flying roller coaster to utilize a launch system rather than a lift system. F.L.Y. features two separate LSM launches that launches trains up to a top speed of 48.5 mph (78.1 km/h) over 4,055.1 feet (1,236.0 m) of track making it the world&#x27;s longest flying coaster.

Since opening, F.L.Y. has been met with overwhelmingly positive reception for its innovative design, riding experience, operations, capacity, and theming that have won the coaster several industry awards.

Vekoma&#x27;s flying roller coasters have a 54-inch minimum-height requirement.

=== Bolliger &amp; Mabillard ===

Swiss manufacturer B&amp;M debuted their flying coaster model Air in 2002, jointly developed with ride designer John Wardley.
Riders take a seating position like on a regular inverted coaster with a chest harness and leglocks. They are then tilted 90° so they assume a frontwards lying position

=== Zamperla ===

Italy&#x27;s Zamperla produces a flying roller coaster model dubbed &#x27;Volare&#x27; (Italian for &quot;to fly&quot;). Riders lie down in the cars, which hang from an upper rail at a 45-degree angle. The car is then lifted up into a flying position while holding the riders inside. This model is very compact and affordable (estimated to be US$6 million) and comes with a unique spiral lift hill in which a tall spinning column with two vertical poles connected to it push the cars up the spiral track. The minimum rider height requirement is .

The first Volare debuted as a prototype in 2002 as Flying Coaster at Elitch Gardens, where it operated until 2007. It faced numerous technical issues that were corrected on subsequent models produced by Zamperla. After closing, Flying Coaster was returned to Zamperla, where it was refurbished and installed at Coney Island as Soarin&#x27; Eagle.

<doc id="691568" wikidata="Q7202110" url="?curid=691568" title="Plasticville">
<text>Plasticville is a brand of plastic toy train building sold in the United States, made by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Bachmann Industries since 1947 (although they were first advertised in 1946). In 1984, Plasticville as well as the entire line was taken over by Kader Industries of Dongguan, China and made entirely in China.

Plasticville buildings are a simple design, made of walls that snap together, permitting them to be assembled without glue and easily disassembled again for storage. Out of the box, Plasticville buildings are usually two-tone, with building walls of one color and the doors, windows and roof molded out of a different colored plastic. With few exceptions, Plasticville buildings are styled after 1950s suburban buildings, and the product line has not changed since the late 1950s.

Most Plasticville buildings are 1:64 scale with 1:48 scale doors, a design compromise that allows them to be used with O gauge, O27 gauge, or S gauge train layouts without looking far off-scale. This allowed one product line to serve Lionel&#x27;s low-end and high-end product lines as well as American Flyer&#x27;s product line in the 1950s. Later, as HO scale gained popularity, Bachmann produced a line of 1:87 scale buildings for that standard.

== History ==
The first Plasticville product was a plastic fence, first marketed as a Christmas tree accessory. When Bachmann found out consumers were using its product on train layouts, it also added some other accessories such as trees, bushes, and bridges. By 1950, Bachmann had added houses and stores to the product line, and Plasticville quickly became the most popular brand of train buildings on the U.S. market. Bachmann added several buildings to the product line every year until 1958. Some of these buildings were of Bachmann design, but others came from competing product lines that Bachmann absorbed in the mid-1950s.

In the late 1950s, mass-market interest in trains declined, with other pastimes, such as slot cars, gaining at their expense. Bachmann responded in 1963 by introducing a line of accessories for slot car tracks.

Although not all pieces were manufactured every year, the Plasticville line has remained commercially available since the 1950s.

In 1984, Plasticville as well as the entire line OF Bachmann Industries was taken over by Kader Industries of Dongguan, China and made entirely there in China.

== Collecting ==
The only way to accurately date many Plasticville buildings is by examining their packaging. A Plasticville building has its highest collectible value when accompanied by its original box and in an unglued and unpainted state. Glued Plasticville structures are worth about 20% as much to a collector as an unglued piece, although a Plasticville piece that is nicely glued and painted will have value for use in a train layout, rather than as a collectible.

The plastic used in modern Plasticville has a slightly different texture from vintage Plasticville and although Bachmann uses the same molds today as in the 1950s, it uses different colors in an effort to not diminish the collector value of its old pieces. Re-issues produced after 1997 are marked &quot;Made in China.&quot;

Variations in common buildings can drive up the value. The common Plasticville one-story ranch house is worth about $5, but a variation using dark blue plastic is worth about $200.

Many Plasticville collectors join the Plasticville Collectors Association (PCA). The purpose of the association is to promote a sense of fellowship among Plasticville, USA collectors and to serve as an accurate source of information regarding all aspects of Plasticville collecting for its members and the general public.

With declining values, collectors are becoming somewhat scarce since it was taken over by Kader Industries in 1984.

<doc id="691571" wikidata="Q6226649" url="?curid=691571" title="John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper">
<text>John Colepeper, 1st Baron Culpeper ( – 11 July 1660) was an English military officer and politician who, as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1642–43) and Master of the Rolls (1643) was an influential counsellor of King Charles I during the English Civil War, who rewarded him with a peerage and some landholdings in Virginia. During the Commonwealth he lived abroad in Europe, where he continued to act as a servant, advisor and supporter of King Charles II in exile. Having taken part in the Prince&#x27;s escape into exile in 1646, Colepeper accompanied Charles in his triumphant return to England in May 1660, but died only two months later. Although descended from Colepepers of Bedgebury, Sir John was of a distinct cadet branch settled at Wigsell in the parish of Salehurst.

==Colepeper of Wigsell==
The Colepeper family resided in Kent and Sussex during the later Middle Ages, and certain of them served in administrative capacities (particularly as High Sheriffs of Kent and in the stewardship of Romney Marsh) from as early as the reign of King Edward III (1322-1377). Branches of the family settled at various locations. John Colepeper derived from the branch which settled at the manor of Wigsell in the parish of Salehurst, East Sussex. Sir John Colepeper of Bedgebury, in Goudhurst in the county of Kent, had by his wife Agnes two sons, the elder of whom, Alexander, established the Colepepers of Bedgebury, and the younger, Walter, took the ancient Colepeper inheritance of Wigsell as his portion.

Walter Colepeper married Anne (daughter and heir of Harry Aucher of Lossenham, a manor in Newenden, Kent), and at the time of his death in 1514 was Under-Marshal of Calais. Their eldest son William Colepeper married Cicely Barrett in 1530, when the Wigsell estate was settled on William&#x27;s mother for life, with remainder to William and Anne. William&#x27;s eldest son was John, born 1530: he married Elizabeth Sidley of Southfleet, Kent around 1560, and was buried at Salehurst in 1612 aged 82.

==Birth and young life==

The eldest son of John and Elizabeth was Thomas Colepeper (1561-1613), who first married Anne Slaney. Anne was a daughter of Sir Stephen Slaney, citizen and Skinner, Alderman of London 1584-1608 and Lord Mayor of London 1595-96, who died in 1608, and his wife Margaret Fesaunt (died 1619). Thomas and Anne were the natural parents of the future 1st Baron Colepeper of Thoresway. After the birth of two sons and a daughter, Anne died in 1601/02. Thomas Colepeper then remarried to Mary, daughter of Roger Beeston (citizen of London), and widow of Francis Gibbon of Benenden, Kent. By this second marriage there was a son Thomas who died in infancy in 1607, and three daughters.
The Wigsell inheritance at first should have descended to Thomas and Anne&#x27;s elder son, Slaney Colepeper, but he died in 1617. It was then determined by his &quot;inquisition post mortem&quot; that it should pass to his younger brother John Colepeper, who in fact succeeded as the heir of Wigsell. Their full sister Elizabeth became the wife of Sir Robert Brooke of Yoxford, Suffolk in 1620: Brooke had formerly been married to the stepdaughter of John&#x27;s aunt Mary Slaney, second wife of Sir Humphrey Weld (died 1610).

John&#x27;s father, and his uncle John Colepeper of Feckenham (1563-1635), were member of the Virginia Company of London from 1609. John himself was a member from 1617 to 1623. He was knighted in 1621 and sold Wigsell to Cheney Culpeper in 1623. John&#x27;s first marriage, to Philippa Snelling in 1628, lasted only until her death in 1630, leaving him a son and a daughter. His second marriage, to Judith Colepeper of Hollingbourne, Kent, a distant 
cousin, was in January 1630/31 and gave rise to a large family (see below).

==In Parliament, 1640-1644==
John Colepeper began his career in military service abroad, and came first into public notice at home through his knowledge of country affairs, being summoned often before the council board to give evidence on such matters. He was knighted, and after representing Rye in the Short Parliament in April 1640 was elected member later in the year for Kent in the Long Parliament. He then took the popular side, speaking against monopolies on 9 November 1640, being entrusted with the impeachment of Sir Robert Berkeley on 12 February 1641, supporting the attainder of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and being appointed to the committee of defence on 12 August 1641.

He separated, however, from the popular party on the Church question, owing to political rather than religious objections, fearing the effect of the revolutionary changes which were now contemplated. He opposed the London petition for the abolition of episcopacy, the project of religious union with the Scots, and the &quot;Root and Branch Bill&quot;, and on 1 September he moved a resolution in defence of the prayer-book. In the following session he opposed the Militia Bill and the Grand Remonstrance, and finally on 2 January 1642 he joined the party of Charles I, taking office as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the same motion by which Lord Falkland was appointed Secretary of State, and both were sworn as Privy Councillors. In 1642, the subject along with Viscount Lucius Cary wrote the King&#x27;s response to Parliament in regard to the military measure. Describing the growing power of corporations, he is reported to have said &quot;they sip from our cup, they dip in our dish, they sit by our fire&quot;.

Colepeper highly disapproved of the king&#x27;s attempt to arrest John Pym and four other members of the Long Parliament, which was made without his knowledge, but advocated the enterprise for the king&#x27;s removal to Kingston-upon-Hull. On 25 August 1642 he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons to deliver the king&#x27;s final proposals for peace: &quot;There standing bareheaded, he looked so dejectedly as if he had been a delinquent rather than a member of the House, or privy counsellor, or messenger from His Majesty&quot; He was afterwards present at the Battle of Edgehill, where he took part in Prince Rupert&#x27;s charge and opposed the retreat of the king&#x27;s forces from the battlefield.

In December he was made by Charles Master of the Rolls. He was a leading member of the Oxford Parliament, and was said, in opposition to the general opinion, to have counselled considerable concessions to secure peace. His influence in military affairs caused him to be much disliked by Prince Rupert and the army, and the general animosity against him was increased by his advancement to the peerage on 21 October 1644 by the title of Baron Colepeper of Thoresway in Lincolnshire.

==A royalist abroad, 1645-1660==

Lord Culpeper was despatched with Edward Hyde in charge of the Prince of Wales to the West in March 1645, and on 2 March 1646, after Charles&#x27;s final defeat, embarked with the prince for Scilly (the Isles of Scilly in the county of Cornwall) and thence to France. He strongly advocated gaining the support of the Scots by granting them religious concessions, a policy supported by the queen and Mazarin, but opposed by Hyde and other leading royalists, and he constantly urged this course upon the king, while at the same time deprecating any yielding on the subject of the militia. He promoted the mission of Sir John Berkeley in 1647 to secure an understanding between Charles and the army.

In 1648 he accompanied the prince in his unsuccessful naval expedition, and returned with him to The Hague, where violent altercations broke out among the royalist leaders. Colepeper went so far, on one occasion in the council, as to challenge Prince Rupert, and was himself severely assaulted in the streets by Sir Robert Walsh. In the Charter of 1649, he was one-seventh proprietor of Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck, and his cousin Thomas Colepeper (1602-1660) (son of John Colepeper of Feckenham), who emigrated to Virginia and died there leaving four children who established themselves in America, held a further one-seventh in 1649.
Culpeper and others were named together with Charles and James Stuart, to be proscribed and banished as enemies and traitors to the Commonwealth, and his estates were confiscated to the uses of Parliament. After the execution of Charles I, he continued to press upon Charles II the acceptance of the Scottish proposals. He was sent to Russia in 1650, where he obtained a loan of 20,000 rubles from the Tsar: soon after his return, he was sent to the Netherlands to procure military assistance. Colepeper was obliged to leave France under the terms of the treaty agreed in August 1654 between Oliver Cromwell and Mazarin, and thenceforth he appears to have resided in Flanders. He accompanied Charles II to the south of France in September 1659, at the time of the Treaty of the Pyrenees.

==Death, monument, and appreciation==
At the Restoration Colepeper returned to England, but he survived only for a few weeks, and died on 11 July 1660. His will, dated 3 July, was proved by his wife Judith, who was buried at Hollingbourne in 1691. His white marble wall monument, with a long inscription, was set up in Hollingbourne church by his son John, 3rd Baron Colepeper, and his daughter Elizabeth Hamilton, in 1695. The epitaph includes part of his Patent of Honour from King Charles I of 1644, given both in Latin and in English:&quot;Whereas our wellbeloved and most faithfull counsellor Iohn Culpeper Kt Mr of the Rolles of our Chancery of the Antient and Noble family of the Culpepers in our Counties of Kent and Sussex (many Ages past renowned for Persons of Eminent Ability both in War &amp; Peace) hath given us signall testimonies of his apparent Loyalty Singular Manhood and profound judgement, Who in that never to be forgotten Battell of Keinton where both our owne and the publicke safety were manifestly at stake being then Chancellor of our Exchequer acquitted himself like a brave Man at Armes when at Newbery and in other occasions alwayes enobled his gowne with Martiall Atchievements, latterly who in our most perillous junctures by his seasonable and wise counsells hath been a principall support of our Crowne &amp; Dignity &amp;c.&quot;

Several contemporary writers agree in testifying to Colepeper&#x27;s great debating powers and to his resources as an adviser, but complain of his want of stability and of his uncertain temper. The Earl of Clarendon, with whom he was often on ill terms, speaks generally in his praise, and repels the charge of corruption levelled against him. His political foresight is shown by a remarkable letter written on 20 September 1658 on the death of Cromwell, in which he foretells with uncommon sagacity the future developments in the political situation, advises the royalists to remain inactive till the right moment and profit by the division of their opponents, and distinguishes George Monck as the one person willing and capable of effecting the Restoration.

==Family==
Lord Colepeper was twice married.

His first wife was Philippa, daughter of Sir John Snelling of West Grinstead, Sussex, whom he married on 29 October 1628 at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate. She was buried at Hollingbourne, Kent, on 16 September 1630: by her, he had one son and one daughter:
* Alexander Colepeper, married Katherine, daughter of Sir Edward Ford of Harting, Sussex. He died without issue. Administration of his estate was granted in 1660 to his widow, who remarried to Ralph Grey, Esq.
* Philippa Colepeper (died before September 1652), married Sir Thomas Harlackenden of Woodchurch, Kent, to whom she brought two sons and two daughters.

His second wife was his cousin Judith Culpeper (married 12 January 1630/31), daughter of Sir Thomas Colepeper of Hollingbourne Manor. (Sir John had sold Wigsell to Judith&#x27;s brother Cheney Culpeper (1601-1663) in 1623. Sir Thomas purchased Leeds Castle in Kent in 1634.)

He was Crown Governor of Virginia from 1680 to 1683. His wife survived him: they had one daughter Catherine, who married Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. He also had a mistress Susanna Willis by whom he had two daughters, namely Susan (wife of Sir Charles Englefield) and Charlotte.
* Elizabeth Colepeper, baptized 1637, in 1661 married James Hamilton, Groom of the Bedchamber to King Charles II; they were the parents of James Hamilton, who became 6th Earl of Abercorn. She was living in 1695 when she and her brother John set up the memorial to their father. She was buried in February 1709/10 at Hollingbourne.

<doc id="691575" wikidata="Q7348900" url="?curid=691575" title="Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull">
<text>Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull (6 August 158425 July 1643) was an English nobleman who joined the Royalist side in the English Civil War after some delay and became lieutenant-general of the counties of Lincoln, Rutland, Huntingdon, Cambridge and Norfolk. He was killed in a friendly fire incident after being captured by Parliamentary forces.

==Early life==
Pierrepont was the second son of Sir Henry Pierrepont of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Frances Cavendish, a daughter of Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick. His sister became Grace, Lady Manners, of Haddon Hall.

In 1596 he became an undergraduate of Oriel College, Oxford, and was later a benefactor in the rebuilding of the college&#x27;s Front Quad.

==Career==
Pierrepont was one of the two Members of Parliament for Nottinghamshire in 1601. He became a JP for Nottinghamshire in 1608 and was appointed High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1615. He was created Baron Pierrepont and Viscount Newark in 1627 and Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull the following year.

In 1633 he bought Thoresby Park.

Pierrepont remained neutral on the outbreak of the Civil War, declaring, in what was later taken to be a prophetic curse:

He eventually became a Royalist, joining King Charles, and was appointed lieutenant-general of royal forces in the counties of Lincoln, Rutland, Huntingdon, Cambridge and Norfolk.

Whilst defending Gainsborough he was taken prisoner, and was killed on 25 July 1643, aged 58, while being conveyed to Hull by boat along the River Trent. Royalist forces fired at his captors from the river bank, accidentally killing the Earl whose body was cut in two by a cannonball.

==Personal life==
Pierrepont married Gertrude Talbot, a daughter of Henry Talbot (1554–1596), a younger son of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, and Elizabeth Reyner (born 1556) on 8 January 1601 in Overton Longueville, Huntingdonshire.

Pierrepont had five sons, the eldest of whom was his heir Henry Pierrepont, later created first Marquess of Dorchester. Other sons included Francis Pierrepont (died 1659), a colonel in the parliamentary army and afterwards a member of the Long Parliament, and William Pierrepont (1608–1679), father-in-law of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare, and of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. 

Pierrepont&#x27;s daughter Lady Frances (born 1615) married Philip Rolleston, Esquire.

He was succeeded in his peerage by his son Henry, who built the first Thoresby Hall in 1670. The author Frances Catherine Barnard was a descendant.
