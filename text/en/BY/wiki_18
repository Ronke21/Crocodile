<text>Blackfriars Theatre was the name given to two separate theatres located in the former Blackfriars Dominican priory in the City of London during the Renaissance. The first theatre began as a venue for the Children of the Chapel Royal, child actors associated with the Queen&#x27;s chapel choirs, and who from 1576 to 1584 staged plays in the vast hall of the former monastery. The second theatre dates from the purchase of the upper part of the priory and another building by James Burbage in 1596, which included the Parliament Chamber on the upper floor that was converted into the playhouse. The Children of the Chapel played in the theatre beginning in the autumn of 1600 until the King&#x27;s Men took over in 1608. They successfully used it as their winter playhouse until all the theatres were closed in 1642 when the English Civil War began. In 1666, the entire area was destroyed in the Great Fire of London.

==First theatre==
Blackfriars Theatre was built on the grounds of the former Dominican monastery. The monastery was located between the Thames and Ludgate Hill within London proper. The black robes worn by members of this order lent the neighbourhood, and theatres, their name. In the pre-Reformation Tudor years, the site was used not only for religious but also for political functions, such as the annulment trial of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII which, some eight decades later, would be reenacted in the same room by Shakespeare&#x27;s company. After Henry&#x27;s expropriation of monastic property, the monastery became the property of the crown; control of the property was granted to Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels. Cawarden used part of the monastery as Revels offices; other parts he sold or leased to the neighbourhood&#x27;s wealthy residents, including Lord Cobham and John Cheke. After Cawarden&#x27;s death in 1559, the property was sold by Lady Cawarden to Sir William More. In 1576, Richard Farrant, then Master of Windsor Chapel leased part of the former buttery from More in order to stage plays. As often in the theatrical practice of the time, this commercial enterprise was justified by the convenient fiction of royal necessity; Farrant claimed to need the space for his child choristers to practice plays for the Queen, but he also staged plays for paying audiences. The theatre was small, perhaps long and wide, and admission, compared to public theatres, expensive (six pence in the gallery, rising in stages to three shillings for a seat in a box close to the stage); both these factors limited attendance at the theatre to a fairly select group of well-to-do gentry and nobles.

For his playing company, Farrant combined his Windsor children with the Children of the Chapel Royal, then directed by William Hunnis. On Farrant&#x27;s death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant&#x27;s widow, putting up a £100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant&#x27;s widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to Henry Evans, a Welsh scrivener and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse to bring suit to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, sometime after Michaelmas Term (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer John Lyly.

As proprietor of the playhouse, Lyly installed Evans as the manager of the new company of Oxford&#x27;s Boys, composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul&#x27;s, and turned his talents to play writing. Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Campaspe&quot; was performed at Blackfriars and subsequently at Court on New Year&#x27;s Day 1584; likewise, his &quot;Sapho and Phao&quot; was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as the payee for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease at the end of Easter Term (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly&#x27;s third play, &quot;Gallathea&quot;.

==Second theatre==

The second Blackfriars was an indoor theatre built elsewhere on the property at the instigation of James Burbage, father of Richard Burbage, and impresario of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. In 1596, Burbage purchased, for £600, the frater of the former priory and rooms below. This large space, perhaps long and 50 wide (15 metres), with high ceilings allowed Burbage to construct two galleries, substantially increasing potential attendance. He employed carpenter Peter Street for the work. (Later, in 1599, Richard Burbage was to engage Street for his ambitious Globe Theatre project.) The nature of Burbage&#x27;s modifications to his purchase is not clear, and the many contemporary references to the theatre do not offer a precise picture of its design. Once fitted for playing, the space may have been about long and wide (20 by 14 metres), including tiring areas. There were at least two and possibly three galleries, and perhaps a number of stage boxes adjacent to the stage. Estimates of its capacity have varied from below 600 to almost 1000, depending on the number of galleries and boxes. Perhaps as many as ten spectators would have encumbered the stage.

As Burbage built, however, a petition from the residents of the wealthy neighbourhood and led by Lady Elizabeth Russell, persuaded the Privy Council to forbid playing there. Referring to &quot;divers both honorable and others then inhabiting the said precinct&quot; and &quot;what inconveniences were likely to fall upon them from a common playhouse&quot; the letter was signed even by Lord Hunsdon, patron of Burbage&#x27;s company, and by Richard Field, the Blackfriars printer and hometown neighbour of William Shakespeare. The company was absolutely forbidden to perform there. Three years later, Richard Burbage was able to lease the property to Henry Evans, who had been among those ejected more than fifteen years earlier. Evans entered a partnership with Nathaniel Giles, Hunnis&#x27;s successor at the Chapel Royal. They used the theatre for a commercial enterprise with a group called the Children of the Chapel, which combined the choristers of the chapel with other boys, many taken up from local grammar schools under colour of Giles&#x27;s warrant to provide entertainment for the Queen. The dubious legality of these dramatic impressments led to a challenge from a father in 1600; however, this method brought the company some of its most famous actors, including Nathaniel Field and Salmon Pavy. The residents did not protest at this use, probably because of perceived social differences between the adult and child companies.

While it housed this company, Blackfriars was the site of an explosion of innovative drama and staging. Together with its competitor, Paul&#x27;s Children, the Blackfriars company produced plays by a number of the most talented young dramatists of Jacobean literature, among them Thomas Middleton, Ben Jonson, George Chapman, and John Marston. Chapman and Jonson wrote almost exclusively for Blackfriars in this period, while Marston began with Paul&#x27;s but switched to Blackfriars, in which he appears to have been a sharer, by around 1605. In the latter half of the decade, the company at Blackfriars premiered plays by Francis Beaumont (&quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;) and John Fletcher (&quot;The Faithful Shepherdess&quot;) that, although failures in their first production, marked the first significant appearance of these two dramatists, whose work would profoundly affect early Stuart drama. The new plays of all these playwrights deliberately pushed the accepted boundaries of personal and social satire, of violence on stage, and of sexual frankness. These plays appear to have attracted members of a higher social class than was the norm at the Bankside and Shoreditch theatres, and the admission price (sixpence for a cheap seat) probably excluded the poorer patrons of the amphitheatres. Prefaces and internal references speak of gallants and Inns of Court men, who came not only to see a play but also, of course, to be seen; the private theatres sold seats on the stage itself.

The Blackfriars playhouse was also the source of other innovations which would profoundly change the nature of English commercial staging: it was among the first commercial theatrical enterprises to rely on artificial lighting, and it featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston&#x27;s &quot;The Malcontent&quot; (1604) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time.

In the years around the turn of the century, the children&#x27;s companies were something of a phenomenon; a reference in &quot;Hamlet&quot; to &quot;little eyasses&quot; suggests that even the adult companies felt threatened by them. By the later half of that decade, the fashion had changed somewhat. In 1608, Burbage&#x27;s company (by this time, the King&#x27;s Men) took possession of the theatre, which they still owned, this time without objections from the neighbourhood. There were originally seven sharers in the reorganised theatre: Richard Burbage, William Shakespeare, Henry Condell, John Heminges, and William Sly, all members of the King&#x27;s Men, plus Cuthbert Burbage and Thomas Evans, agent for the theatre manager Henry Evans. This arrangement of shareholders (or &quot;housekeepers) was similar to how the Globe Theatre was operated. Sly, however, died soon after the arrangement was made, and his share was divided among the other six.

After renovations, the King&#x27;s Men began using the theatre for performances in 1609. Thereafter the King&#x27;s Men played in Blackfriars for the seven months in winter, and at the Globe during the summer. Blackfriars appears to have brought in a little over twice the revenue of the Globe; the shareholders could earn as much as £13 from a single performance, apart from what went to the actors.

In the reign of Charles I, even Queen Henrietta Maria was in the Blackfriars audience. On 13 May 1634 she and her attendants saw a play by Philip Massinger; in late 1635 or early 1636 they saw Lodowick Carlell&#x27;s &quot;Arviragus and Philicia, part 2;&quot; and they attended a third performance in May 1636.

The theatre closed at the onset of the English Civil War, and was demolished on 6 August 1655.

==Reconstructions==

===Blackfriars Playhouse===

The American Shakespeare Center&#x27;s Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, is a re-creation of a Jacobean theatre based on what is known of the original Blackfriars. Completed at a cost of $3.7 million, the 300-seat theatre opened in September 2001. Architect Tom McLaughlin based the design on plans for other 17th-century theatres, his own trips to England to view surviving halls of the period, Shakespeare&#x27;s stage directions and other research and consultation. The lighting imitates that of the original Blackfriars.

===Sam Wanamaker Playhouse===
During the construction of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, London, in the 1990s, the shell for an indoor theatre was built next door, to house a &quot;simulacrum&quot; of the Blackfriars Theatre. As no reliable plans of the Blackfriars are known, the plan for the new theatre was based on drawings found in the 1960s at Worcester College, Oxford, at first thought to date from the early 17th century, and to be the work of Inigo Jones. The shell was built to accommodate a theatre as specified by the drawings, and the planned name was the Inigo Jones Theatre. In 2005, the drawings were dated to 1660 and attributed to John Webb. They nevertheless represent the earliest known plan for an English theatre, and are thought to approximate the layout of the Blackfriars Theatre. Some features believed to be typical of earlier in the 17th century were added to the new theatre&#x27;s design.

Completed at a cost of £7.5 million, the theatre opened as the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in January 2014. Designed by Jon Greenfield, in collaboration with Allies and Morrison, it is an oak structure built inside the building&#x27;s brick shell. The thrust stage is surmounted by a musicians&#x27; gallery, and the theatre has an ornately painted ceiling. The seating capacity is 340, with benches in a pit and two horse-shoe galleries, placing the audience close to the actors. Shutters around the first gallery admit artificial daylight. When the shutters are closed, lighting is provided by beeswax candles mounted in sconces, as well as on six height-adjustable chandeliers and even held by the actors.

<text>Joachim Johannes Ferreira (8 August 1835 – 16 May 1917) was a Boer commandant of the First Boer War. This general J. Ferreira should not be confused with general I. Ferreira.

== Family ==
Ferreira was born near Uitenhage, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, as the eldest child of Marthinus Stephanus Ferreira (born 2 February 1810) and Aletta Prinsloo (born 1815), with a younger brother and sister. Young Ferreira was taken on the Great Trek as an infant. He married Adriana Gertina Davel (31 January 1848  – Piet Retief, Eastvaal District Council, Mpumalanga, 29 January 1929) and had a daughter by her.

==Career==
He settled near Swaziland with other Voortrekker families in what they called the Commonwealth of the Klein Vrystaat in 1875. At the same time, Swazi King Mbandzeni granted a 36,000-acre grazing concession to Ferreira and his son-in-law, Franz Ignatius Maritz, the largest concession to Boer settlers at the time.

Ferreira began during the First Boer War (1880-1881) as the commandant of the Utrecht commando, and went on to lead one of the two Boer divisions at the Battle of Majuba Hill on 27 February 1881. The other group was led by Stephanus Roos. Ferreira was responsible for negotiating the transfer of land east of the Lebombo Mountains to the South African Republic. His plans were frustrated by the actions of Sir Charles Saunders who annexed the territory which became known as British Maputaland.

In the Second Boer War (1899-1902) Ferreira was a Boer general as well.
Joachim Ferreira died near Piet Retief on 16 May 1917.

<text>Nordaustlandet (Anglicised as North East Land) is the second-largest island in the archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, with an area of . It lies north east of Spitsbergen, separated by Hinlopen Strait. Much of Nordaustlandet lies under large ice caps, mainly Austfonna and Vestfonna, the remaining parts of the north being tundra inhabited by reindeer and walruses. The island is uninhabited and lies entirely within Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve.

==History==

English walrus hunters first sighted the south point of Nordaustlandet in 1617. This discovery was shown on the &quot;Muscovy Company&#x27;s map&quot; (1625; but based on discoveries made in and prior to 1622), with the island labeled as &quot;Sir Thomas Smyth&#x27;s Iland&quot;. It also shows the North Cape (&quot;Point Purchas&quot;). It is first named &quot;Oostlandt&quot; (&quot;East Land&quot;) on a Dutch 1662 map, and the following year another Dutch map marked its coastline more distinctly, showing its west and north coasts, separating the latter from the Seven Islands (Sjuøyane). A Dutch map of 1710 was the first to show the island accurately, naming it &quot;Het Noord Ooster Land&quot; (&quot;The North-east Land&quot;).

During the German occupation of Norway in World War II, eleven German soldiers were sent to Nordaustlandet in August 1944 to report on the weather. They later learned about the Nazi unconditional surrender via radio and called for transport home, but did not receive any response until months later when Norway sent a whaling ship to rescue them.

==Geology and landscape==
The rock types in Nordaustlandet stem from many different geological eras. The northern part consists of old crystalline basement, with rocks such as marble, quartzite, mica schist, gneiss and granite. East of Lady Franklinfjorden, on the peninsula Botniahalvøya and east of Duvefjorden there are volcanic rocks. In the east and south of Rijpfjorden the bedrock is made up of distinctive red-coloured granite. The Rijpfjord granite is medium grained, and contains two micas (muscovite and biotite) in addition to quartz, plagioclase and pink K-feldspar. It was emplaced in late Silurian times.

Layered gabbro and dolerite of Silurian age occur at Kapp Laura in easternmost Nordaustlandet, on the island of Storøya, and in the eastern part of the island of Kvitøya. On Andréeneset, in the southern part of Kvitøya, gneisses and granites are the most common rock types. Four generations of rocks: gneiss, amphibolite, and grey and pink granite are present on Isispynten, a headland east of Austfonna. South of Wahlenbergfjorden there is a large area with sedimentary rocks – mostly limestone and dolomite – from the Carboniferous and Permian. The youngest rocks in Nordaustlandet are Jurassic–Cretaceous dolerite dikes, which intrude the basement rocks on the island of Lågøya and in the outlet of Brennevinsfjorden.

Unconsolidated deposits in Nordaustlandet consist of scree slopes, block fields and raised shore deposits. There are only small amounts of river deposits. The largest strandflats on Nordaustlandet can be found in the north-west, around Murchisonfjorden and on the island of Lågøya. Another large strandflat is Svartknausflya in the south, just west of the glacier of Bråsvellbreen. Here, there are raised shore deposits up to 120 m.a.s.l., where ancient whale bones have been found above today&#x27;s sea level. Svartknausflya is also the largest moraine area in Nordaustlandet; it measures about .

Glacial activity has shaped the landscape in Nordaustlandet through several ice ages. Gentle plateaus and rounded mountains are the most common sight. The tallest and steepest mountains, up to 600 m.a.s.l., can be found in the north. The eastern part of Nordaustlandet is covered in glaciers, and there are few areas without ice. Between Vibebukta and Kapp Laura, the steep front of the Austfonna ice cap dominates. The glacier has retracted a bit during recent decades, revealing new areas of dry land on the few headlands that can be found around here (such as Isispynten). Austfonna, including Vegafonna, stretch across an area of . Austfonna covers approximately 58% of Nordaustlandet. Vestfonna is . The largest areas with no ice are between Austfonna and Vestfonna and on the peninsulas in the north and north-west of Nordaustlandet.

The glacier Bråsvellbreen is a branch of Vestfonna. In 1937-1938 it had one of the largest surges ever recorded in Svalbard. The glacier front moved forward and into the ocean.

<text>End Hits is the fifth studio album by American post-hardcore band Fugazi, released on April 28, 1998, by Dischord Records. It was recorded at Inner Ear Studios from March 1997 to September 1997 and produced by the band and Don Zientara, and saw the band continuing with and expanding upon the in-studio experimentation of their previous album &quot;Red Medicine&quot; (1995). Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release.

While the album received mixed reviews upon release due to its experimental nature, &quot;End Hits&quot; has retrospectively received critical acclaim with many publications hailing it as an influential and classic album.

==Background==
Due to the album&#x27;s title, many speculated that it would be the band&#x27;s last release, although the title literally refers to the end-of-the-album drum hits by drummer Brendan Canty that occur after the last song on the album, &quot;F/D,&quot; ends. These drum hits are actually outtakes from the bridge-section of the track &quot;No Surprise,&quot; the fourth song on the album. The title was later revealed to have been an inside-joke by the band.

==Recording==
After the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of their previous album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Red Medicine&quot;, Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow-up release. By March 1997 they had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer Don Zientara to begin recording what would become the &quot;End Hits&quot; album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album.

A wide variety of sound effects and unusual microphone placements were used during both the recording and mixing process. In addition, the band used electronic drums, synthesizers and the practice of drum-layering for the first time, which is most evident on the track &quot;Closed Captioned.&quot; Brendan Canty explained to &quot;Tape Op&quot; Magazine in 1999 &quot;When &quot;Closed Captioned&quot; was recorded, the basic tracks to it are all a drum machine and then I overdubbed two different drum sets on top of it, which I love doing, it gives distance to a song.&quot; Recording for the track &quot;Floating Boy&quot; saw all the drum mics removed at the end of the song except for the bottom-snare mic, to create a hollow and muffled sound, after which synthesizer and several layers of reverb were added.

==Release and reception==
Released on April 28, 1998, the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band&#x27;s highest debuts yet on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. According to Nielsen Soundscan, &quot;End Hits&quot; sold 81,000 copies in the United States as of 2001.

===Initial===

Critical reaction to &quot;End Hits&quot; was mixed. Many critics praised the album&#x27;s heavier tracks like &quot;Five Corporations&quot; and &quot;Place Position&quot; while others questioned the inclusion of the group&#x27;s longer, more experimental songs like &quot;Closed Captioned&quot; and &quot;Floating Boy&quot;. AllMusic critic Andy Kellman singled out the tracks &quot;Closed Captioned&quot;, &quot;Floating Boy&quot; and &quot;Foreman&#x27;s Dog&quot; as &quot;the worst stretch of material Fugazi have recorded&quot;, noting a &quot;virtually complete disregard for linearity that makes things seem stitched together.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; journalist Stephen Dalton was more positive, calling &quot;End Hits&quot; &quot;a rather good record from a well-meaning bunch who are finally allowing a little colour and tenderness into their slate-grey terrorist cell.&quot; The magazine would go on to name the album among their 50 favorites of the year. &quot;Mojo&quot; critic Jenny Bulley remarked that certain tracks seemed to have resulted from &quot;lengthy jam sessions,&quot; observing that &quot;on &#x27;Closed Caption&#x27; [sic] they meander more than is strictly necessary, though the approach works brilliantly on the darker, dubbier &#x27;Pink Frosty&#x27;.&quot; She concluded that &quot;End Hits&quot; &quot;may not be the requisite one-stop shop for Fugazi&#x27;s music, but it&#x27;s a fine record nonetheless.&quot;

===Retrospective===

Four years after the release of &quot;End Hits&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Joshua Klein noted that &quot;the music continues in the experimental vein&quot; of &quot;Red Medicine&quot; and would likely disappoint fans expecting more conventional rock songs, while describing &quot;End Hits&quot; as &quot;a curious look at America&#x27;s most vital band as it finds new and inventive ways to buckle and squirm under its self-imposed constraints.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Stylus&quot;″ Clay Jarvis praised the album as being &quot;a massive step forward for Fugazi: quieter, as the band replaced volume with audible creative force; illogical, as unpredictability became the core of a new world of dynamics for the band; experimental, but in all the right places and for all the right reasons. &quot;End Hits&quot; is a masterful combination of playing and mixing, improvising and editing. And yet it all sounds so natural.&quot; A few years later, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; lauded &quot;End Hits&quot; as a continuation of &quot;the evolutionary sonic path first carved out on &quot;Red Medicine&quot;, except with more focus and even less reliance on the formulaic punk chug of their own invention.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it the 24th best album of 1998; staff writer Sasha Geffen wrote that Fugazi had managed to produce some of their most melodic and accessible songs &quot;without sacrificing any of the muscle of their first four LPs.&quot; The same year, on its 20th anniversary, both &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Magnet&quot; offered the album praise, calling it an &quot;influential&quot; and &quot;classic&quot; album, respectively. &quot;Fact&quot; called it an &quot;audacious trip from a fearless band,&quot; labeling it a &quot;classic in the canon of an impossibly important band&quot; and &quot;a monumental album.&quot;

===Legacy===
Buke and Gase covered &quot;Guilford Fall&quot; live. Dead to Me and TheSTART covered &quot;Five Corporations&quot; and &quot;Place Position&quot; respectively. Rapper P.O.S references and samples the song &quot;Five Corporations&quot; on his album &quot;False Hope&quot;, which was later released on &quot;Never Better&quot;.

==Packaging==
The picture on the album cover is of Hong Kong with the Hopewell Centre prominent in the foreground. Limited vinyl copies of the album feature a gatefold cover, which folds out to display a live photograph of the band playing at the Palladium in New York City, taken by Glen E. Friedman.

<text>The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is the UK&#x27;s chartered professional body for mathematicians and one of the UK&#x27;s learned societies for mathematics (another being the London Mathematical Society).

The IMA aims to advance mathematics and its applications, promote and foster research and other enquiries directed the advancement, teaching and application of mathematics, to seek to establish and maintain high standards of professional conduct for members and to seek to promote, encourage and guide the development of education and training in mathematics.

==History==
In 1959, the need for a professional and learned body for mathematics and its applications was recognised independently by both Sir James Lighthill and a committee of the heads of the mathematics departments of several colleges of technology together with some interested mathematicians from universities, industry and government research establishments. After much discussion, the name and constitution of the institute were confirmed in 1963, and the IMA was approved as a company limited by guarantee on 23 April 1964. In 1990, the institute was incorporated as a royal charter company, and it was registered as a charity in 1993.

==Governance==

The institute is governed via a Council, made up of between 25 and 31 individuals including a president, three past presidents, elected and co-opted members, and honorary officers.

===Honorary officers===

In addition to the president, the six honorary officer roles are listed below with their incumbents:

==Membership==
The IMA has 5,000 members, ten percent of whom live outside the United Kingdom. Forty percent of members are employed in education (schools through to universities) and sixty percent work in commercial and governmental organisations. The institute awards five grades of membership within three groups.

===Corporate membership===
Fellow (FIMA)
Fellows are peer-reviewed by external reference and selected internally through election by the membership committee. Qualifications include a minimum of seven years experience and hold a senior managerial or technical position involving the use of, or training in, mathematics. A Fellow has made outstanding contributions to the development or application of mathematics.

Member (MIMA)
Members have an appropriate degree, a minimum period of three years training and experience after graduation and a position of responsibility involving the application of mathematical knowledge or training in mathematics.

===Leading to corporate membership===
Associate Member (AMIMA)
Associate Member hold a degree in mathematics, a joint degree in mathematics with another subject or a degree with a sufficient mathematical component such as would be expected in physics or engineering.

Students
Student Members are undertaking a course of study which will lead to a qualification that meets Associate Member requirements.

===Non-professional membership===
Affiliate
No requirements are necessary for entry into this grade.

==Professional status==
In 1990 the institute was incorporated by royal charter and was subsequently granted the right to award Chartered Mathematician (CMath) status. The institute may also nominate individuals for the award of Chartered Scientist (CSci) under license from the Science Council. The institute can also award individual Chartered Mathematics Teacher (CMathTeach).

==Publications==

===&quot;Mathematics Today&quot;===
&quot;Mathematics Today&quot; is a general-interest mathematics publication aimed primarily at Institute members, published six times a year and containing articles, reviews, reports and other news on developments in mathematics and its applications.

===Research journals===
Eight research journals are published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the IMA.

*&quot;IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics&quot;
*&quot;IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis&quot;
*&quot;Mathematical Medicine and Biology&quot;
*&quot;IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information&quot;
*&quot;IMA Journal of Management Mathematics&quot;
*&quot;Teaching Mathematics and its Applications&quot;
*&quot;Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA&quot;
*&quot;Transactions of Mathematics and its Applications&quot;

===Other publications===
The IMA began publishing a podcast, &quot;Travels in a Mathematical World&quot;, on 4 October 2008. The IMA also publishes conference proceedings, monographs and special interest group newsletters.

==Conferences==
The institute runs 8–10 conferences most years. These are specialist meetings where new research is presented and discussed.

==Education activities==
The IMA runs a wide range of mathematical activities through the Higher Education Services Area and the Schools and Further Education Group committees.

The IMA operates a Programme Approval Scheme, which provides an &#x27;approval in principle&#x27; for degree courses that meet the educational requirements for Chartered Mathematician. For programmes to be approved, the IMA requires the programme to be an honours degree of at least three years length, which meets the required mathematical content threshold of two-thirds. The programmes also need to meet the QAA benchmark for Mathematics and the Framework for High Education Qualification.

The IMA provides education grants of up to £600 to allow individuals from the UK working in schools or further/higher education to help with the attendance at or the organisation of a mathematics educational activity such as attendance at a conference, expenses to cover a speaker coming into a school, organising a session for a conference.

The IMA also employs a university liaison officer to promote mathematics and the IMA to university students undertaking mathematics and help act as a means of support. As part of this support the IMA runs the University Liaison Grants Scheme to provide university mathematical societies with grants of up to £400 to organise more activities and work more closely with the IMA.

==Prizes==
The councils of the IMA and the London Mathematical Society jointly award the Christopher Zeeman Medal, dedicated to recognising excellence in the communication of mathematics and the David Crighton Award dedicated to the recognition of service to mathematics and the wider mathematics community.

The IMA in cooperation with the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (BAMC) award the biennial IMA Lighthill-Thwaites Prize for early career applied mathematicians.

The IMA awards the Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis, the Catherine Richards Prize for the best articles in Mathematics Today, the John Blake University Teaching Medal and the IMA Gold Medal for outstanding contribution to mathematics and its applications over the years.

The IMA awards student-level prizes at most universities which offer mathematics around the UK. Each student prize is a year&#x27;s membership of the IMA.

==Branches==

The IMA has Branches in the regions London, East Midlands, Lancashire and the , West Midlands, West of England, Ireland and Scotland, which run local activities (like talks by well known mathematicians). Its headquarters are in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.

==Early Career Mathematicians Group==

The Early Career Mathematicians Group of the IMA hold a series of conferences for mathematicians in the first 15 years of their career among other activities.

==Social networking==

As well as all the conferences, meetings and group activities that are held across the country the IMA operates groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, and has a Twitter feed.

==Interaction with other bodies==

Along with the London Mathematical Society, the Royal Statistical Society, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and the Operational Research Society, forms the Council for the Mathematical Sciences. The IMA is a member of the Joint Mathematical Council (JMC) and informs the deliberations of the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME).

The IMA has representatives on Bath University Court, Bradford University Court, Cranfield University Court, Engineering Technology Board and Engineering Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC Public Understanding of Science Committee, Heads of Departments of Mathematical Sciences, International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Joint Mathematical Council, LMS Computer Science Committee, LMS International Affairs Committee, LMS Women in Maths Committee, Maths, Stats &amp; OR Network (part of the HEA), Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, Science Council, Science Council Registration Authority, The Association of Management Sciences (TAMS) and University of Wales, Swansea Court

<text>Julius Edgar Lilienfeld (April 18, 1882 – August 28, 1963) was an American electrical engineer and physicist who has been credited with the first patent on the field-effect transistor in 1925. He was never able to build a working practical semiconductor device based on his concept. Additionally, because of his failure to publish articles in learned journals and since high-purity semiconductor materials were not available to him, his FET patent never achieved fame, causing confusion for later inventors.

==Early life==
Lilienfeld was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg (present-day Lviv) in the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Lilienfeld&#x27;s father was the lawyer Sigmund Lilienfeld, his mother Sarah Jampoler Lilienfeld.

==Education==
After graduating high school in 1899, between 1900 and 1904, Lilienfeld studied at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (renamed Humboldt University in 1949), in Berlin, where he received his Ph.D. on February 18, 1905. In 1905, he started work at the physics institute at Leipzig University as an untenured professor.

==Career==
Lilienfeld&#x27;s early career, at the University of Leipzig, saw him conduct important early work on electrical discharges in &quot;vacuum&quot;, between metal electrodes, from about 1910 onwards. His early passion was to clarify how this phenomenon changed as vacuum preparation techniques improved. More than any other scientist, he was responsible for the identification of field electron emission as a separate physical effect. (He called it &quot;auto-electronic emission&quot;, and was interested in it as a possible electron source for miniaturised X-ray tubes, in medical applications.) Lilienfeld was responsible for the first reliable account in English of the experimental phenomenology of field electron emission, in 1922. The effect was explained by Fowler and Nordheim in 1928.

Lilienfeld moved to the United States in 1921 to pursue his patent claims, resigning his professorship at Leipzig to stay permanently in 1926. In 1928, he began working at Amrad in Malden, Massachusetts, later called Ergon Research Laboratories owned by Magnavox, which closed in 1935.

In the United States Lilienfeld did research on anodic aluminum oxide films, patenting the electrolytic capacitor in 1931, the method continuing to be used throughout the century. He also invented a &quot;FET-like&quot; transistor, filing several patents describing the construction and operation of transistors, as well as many features of modern transistors. (US patent #1,745,175 for a FET-like transistor was granted January 28, 1930.) When Brattain, Bardeen, and their colleague chemist Robert Gibney tried to get patents on their earliest devices, most of their claims were rejected due to the Lilienfeld patents.

The optical radiation emitted when electrons strike a metal surface is named &quot;Lilienfeld radiation&quot; after he first discovered it close to X-ray tube anodes. Its origin is attributed to the excitation of plasmons in the metal surface.

The American Physical Society has named one of its major prizes after Lilienfeld.

==Personal life==
Lilienfeld was a German-speaking Ashkenazi Jew who was a citizen of Austria-Hungary and later had dual citizenship in the United States and in Poland. He married an American, Beatrice Ginsburg, in New York City on May 2, 1926. They lived in Winchester, Massachusetts, where Lilienfeld was director of the Ergon Research Laboratories in Malden, becoming a United States citizen in 1934. After it closed in 1935, he and his wife built a house on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands in hope of escaping an allergy associated with wheat fields, from which Lilienfeld had suffered for most of his life. Lilienfeld frequently traveled between St. Thomas and various mainland locations and continued to test new ideas and patent the resulting products.

<text>The Oregon and California Railroad was formed from the Oregon Central Railroad when it was the first to operate a stretch south of Portland in 1869. This qualified the railroad for land grants in California, whereupon the name of the railroad soon changed to Oregon &amp; California Rail Road Company. In 1887, the line was completed over Siskiyou Summit, and the Southern Pacific Railroad assumed control of the railroad, although it was not officially sold to Southern Pacific until January 3, 1927. This route was eventually spun off from the Southern Pacific as the Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad.

==Land grants and growth==

As part of the U.S. government&#x27;s desire to foster settlement and economic development in the western states, in July 1866, Congress passed the Oregon and California Railroad Act, which made of land available for a company that built a railroad from Portland, Oregon to San Francisco, distributed by the state of Oregon in land grants for each mile of track completed. Two companies, both of which named themselves the Oregon Central Railroad, began a competition to build the railroad, one on the west side of the Willamette River and one on the east side. The two lines would eventually merge and reorganize as the Oregon and California Railroad.

In 1869, Congress changed how the grants were to be distributed, requiring the railroads to sell land along the line to settlers in parcels at $2.50 per acre. The purpose of these restrictions was to encourage settlement and economic development, while compensating the O&amp;C Railroad for its costs of construction. Construction efforts were sporadic, finally reaching completion in 1887 after the financially troubled O&amp;C Railroad was acquired by the Southern Pacific. The land was distributed in a checkerboard pattern, with sections laid out for on either side of the rail corridor with the government retaining the alternate sections for future growth.

By 1872, the railroad had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley towns such as Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to the part of the river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As the railroad made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.

From about 1870 to 1888, ferry service connected Downtown Portland to the East Portland terminal. The original ferry service, established by Ben Holladay, was near the present-day location of the Steel Bridge; in 1879, Henry Villard put the O&amp;CRR Ferry #2 into service, near the present-day location of the Burnside Bridge. The O&amp;CRR Ferry #2 was rendered obsolete by the construction of the Morrison and Steel bridges, and ultimately relocated to San Francisco, where it was converted to an oil-fueled ferry the &quot;Vallejo&quot; and, later, a famous houseboat, still in use as of 2013.

==Mismanagement and fraud==

While construction was still ongoing, multiple charges of land fraud arose. The company was accused of rounding up individuals from saloons in Portland&#x27;s waterfront district, and paying them to sign applications to purchase parcels of O&amp;C lands as &quot;settlers,&quot; then selling these fraudulent instruments in large blocks to corporate interests through corrupt middlemen.

That elaborate money laundering and land fraud scheme was only the beginning: Southern Pacific Railroad eventually abandoned the pretense of nonexistent settlers, and sold lands in large parcels directly to developers for as much as US$40 per acre. By 1902, with land prices soaring, the company declared it was terminating land sales altogether. When the scandal broke in 1904 through an investigation by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.

Newly elected President Theodore Roosevelt, as part of his plan of progressive reforms, vowed in 1903 to &quot;clean up the O&amp;C land fraud mess, once and for all!&quot; Over the following two years, Roosevelt&#x27;s investigators collected evidence, and over 1,000 politicians, businessmen, railroad executives, and others were indicted. Many were eventually tried and convicted on charges including fraud, bribery, and other corruption. The federal government sought return of the grant lands from the railroad not actually part of the right of way for the railroad line itself.

==Revestiture of lands==

In 1915, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the railroad had been built as promised, so the railroad company should not be forced to completely forfeit the lands, despite having violated the terms of the grant. Congress responded in 1916, with the Chamberlain-Ferris Act. This law put the O&amp;C lands back in U.S. federal government control, and compensated the company at an amount equivalent to what it would have received had it abided by the $2.50 per acre limit. Counties with O&amp;C land also received revenue from timber and land sales to make up for the loss of local and state taxation revenue from the land. The law was modified in 1926 by the Stanfield Act, by the 1937 O&amp;C Act, and most recently, by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 which has been renewed several times and includes other rural counties in the United States. As timber revenue on the O&amp;C lands has declined over the years, counties have faced financial difficulty as they struggle to fill the revenue gap.

<doc id="697150" wikidata="Q68261990" url="?curid=697150" title="Uninstaller">
<text>An uninstaller, also called a deinstaller, is a variety of utility software designed to remove other software or parts of it from a computer. It is the opposite of an installer. Uninstallers are useful primarily when software components are installed in multiple directories, or where some software components might be shared between the system being uninstalled and other systems that remain in use.

Generic uninstallers flourished in the 1990s due to the popularity of shared libraries and the constraints of then-current operating systems, especially Microsoft Windows XP. Declining storage costs and increasing capacity subsequently made reclaiming disk space less urgent, while end-user applications have increasingly relied on simpler installation architectures that consolidate all components to facilitate removal.

==Components==
Typical uninstallers contain the following components:
* Logger: The Logger is used to log installations (e.g., log which files were added or changed, which registry entries were added or changed, etc. at the time of installation). This log is used when the user decides to uninstall the logged installation at later date (in that case, the log is &quot;reversed&quot; — i.e., the log is read, but opposite actions are taken in reverse order).
* Uninstaller: The Uninstaller is used to reverse changes in the log. This way, the applications can be uninstalled because all changes that were made at the times of installation are reversed.
* Analyzer (optional): The Analyzer is used to uninstall programs of which installation is not logged. In that case, the program analyzes the program and finds (and deletes, if the user decided to uninstall the program) all related components.
* Watcher (optional): The Watcher watches running programs for installation programs (and usually offers to start the logger when such programs are detected). Usually, this works by watching the tasklist for any names that are commonly used by installation programs (e.g., SETUP.EXE, INSTALL.EXE, etc.)
* Other tools (optional): Some uninstallers may also contain other related tools for clearing caches or removing unwanted files.

==History==

Prior to about the 1990s, there was no such thing as an uninstaller, as most programs were simply stored on disk and/or tape, and a program was &quot;removed&quot; by simply erasing it. As operating systems and applications became more complex, mere deletion of a program might be inadequate or insufficient to remove the program in its entirety. Entries might be left behind in a system database such as a registry, it may have additional data files, configuration files, sample files, etc.

Uninstall was invented by Jack Bicer. While he was working on Norton Desktop for Windows at Symantec, Bicer came up with the Uninstall concept and developed the first Uninstall program in 1991. When published on March 23, 1992, Norton Desktop for Windows V.20 (see the official - README.TXT) was the first software package ever to include an Uninstaller, shown under the &quot;Uninstalling Norton Desktop&quot; section.

After the release of Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, Ken Spreitzer, who was a tester for the product at Symantec, capitalized on the uninstall idea and wrote the first widely used PC program called &quot;UnInstaller&quot;, initially licensed to MicroHelp and then by February 1998 sold by CyberMedia. MicroHelp published Spreitzer&#x27;s program as Uninstaller version 1. In 1995, Spreitzer told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the royalties he received from MicroHelp for Uninstaller made him a millionaire by age 30. Tim O&#x27;Pry, while president of MicroHelp, substantially rewrote the code for Uninstaller version 2, which became a best-selling program.

<text>Central Railway (abbreviated CR) is one of the 19 zones of Indian Railways. Its headquarters are located at Mumbai. It has the distinction of operating the first passenger railway line in India, which opened from Mumbai to Thane on .

== History ==
The railway zone was formed on 5 November 1951 by grouping several government-owned railways, including the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the Scindia State Railway of the former princely state of Gwalior, Nizam State Railway, Wardha Coal State Railway and the Dholpur State Railway.

The Central Railway zone formerly included large parts of Madhya Pradesh and part of southern Uttar Pradesh, which made it the largest railway zone in India in terms of area, track mileage and staff. These areas became the new West Central Railway zone in April 2003.

The Central Railway General Manager&#x27;s official residence (erstwhile GIPR agent&#x27;s residence), &#x27;Glenogle&#x27;-a Grade II-B heritage bungalow, is located on Bhausaheb Hire Marg (Mount Pleasant Road), adjacent to the Maharashtra Chief minister&#x27;s official residence &#x27;Varsha&#x27; in Malabar Hill, Mumbai.

==Routes==
=== Main/Long Routes of Central Railway ===
** Mumbai CSMT-Kalyan-Igatpuri-Nashik road-Manmad-Jalgaon-Bhusawal

One of the oldest and important railway project of central railway zone was Kalyan-Ahmednagar railway project, which was in planning stage since British regime. It was referred to as 3rd ghat project. A survey was carried out in 1973, 2000, 2006, 2014 etc, and the project was in the Railways Board pink book in 2010, but unfortunately the project was not started. The alignment length of this project was 184 km, and it could have been the shortest route for Marathwada, Andhra and Telangana. The major challenge for this project is 18.96 km long tunnel in Malshej Ghat section.
Malshej Kriti samiti is following for Kalyan-Ahmednagar railway project. Kalyan-Murbad section which is first phase of this project is already under survey stage.

<text>In theoretical physics, the hierarchy problem is the problem concerning the large discrepancy between aspects of the weak force and gravity. There is no scientific consensus on why, for example, the weak force is 1024 times stronger than gravity.

== Technical definition ==
A hierarchy problem occurs when the fundamental value of some physical parameter, such as a coupling constant or a mass, in some Lagrangian is vastly different from its effective value, which is the value that gets measured in an experiment. This happens because the effective value is related to the fundamental value by a prescription known as renormalization, which applies corrections to it. 

Typically the renormalized value of parameters are close to their fundamental values, but in some cases, it appears that there has been a delicate cancellation between the fundamental quantity and the quantum corrections. Hierarchy problems are related to fine-tuning problems and problems of naturalness. 

Over the past decade many scientists argued that the hierarchy problem is a specific application of Bayesian statistics.

Studying renormalization in hierarchy problems is difficult, because such quantum corrections are usually power-law divergent, which means that the shortest-distance physics are most important. Because we do not know the precise details of the quantum gravity, we cannot even address how this delicate cancellation between two large terms occurs. Therefore, researchers are led to postulate new physical phenomena that resolve hierarchy problems without fine-tuning.

== Overview ==
Suppose a physics model requires four parameters to produce a very high-quality working model capable of generating predictions regarding some aspect of our physical universe. Suppose we find through experiments that the parameters have values: 1.2, 1.31, 0.9 and a value near . One might wonder how such figures arise. But in particular, might be especially curious about a theory where three values are close to one, and the fourth is so different; in other words, the huge disproportion we seem to find between the first three parameters and the fourth. We might also wonder if one force is so much weaker than the others that it needs a factor of to allow it to be related to them in terms of effects, how did our universe come to be so exactly balanced when its forces emerged? In current particle physics, the differences between some parameters are much larger than this, so the question is even more noteworthy.

One answer given by philosophers is the anthropic principle. If the universe came to exist by chance, and perhaps vast numbers of other universes exist or have existed, then life capable of physics experiments only arose in universes that, by chance, had very balanced forces. All of the universes where the forces were not balanced did not develop life capable of asking this question. So if lifeforms like human beings are aware and capable of asking such a question, humans must have arisen in a universe having balanced forces, however rare that might be.

A second possible answer is that there is a deeper understanding of physics that we currently do not possess. There might be parameters that we can derive physical constants from that have less unbalanced values, or there might be a model with fewer parameters.

== Examples in particle physics ==
=== Higgs mass ===
In particle physics, the most important hierarchy problem is the question that asks why the weak force is 1024 times as strong as gravity. Both of these forces involve constants of nature, the Fermi constant for the weak force and the Newtonian constant of gravitation for gravity. Furthermore, if the Standard Model is used to calculate the quantum corrections to Fermi&#x27;s constant, it appears that Fermi&#x27;s constant is surprisingly large and is expected to be closer to Newton&#x27;s constant unless there is a delicate cancellation between the bare value of Fermi&#x27;s constant and the quantum corrections to it.

More technically, the question is why the Higgs boson is so much lighter than the Planck mass (or the grand unification energy, or a heavy neutrino mass scale): one would expect that the large quantum contributions to the square of the Higgs boson mass would inevitably make the mass huge, comparable to the scale at which new physics appears unless there is an incredible fine-tuning cancellation between the quadratic radiative corrections and the bare mass.

The problem cannot even be formulated in the strict context of the Standard Model, for the Higgs mass cannot be calculated. In a sense, the problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles, in which the Higgs boson mass will be calculable, should not have excessive fine-tunings.

=== Theoretical solutions ===
There have been many proposed solutions by many experienced physicists.

==== Supersymmetry ====
Some physicists believe that one may solve the hierarchy problem via supersymmetry. Supersymmetry can explain how a tiny Higgs mass can be protected from quantum corrections. Supersymmetry removes the power-law divergences of the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass and solves the hierarchy problem as long as the supersymmetric particles are light enough to satisfy the Barbieri–Giudice criterion. This still leaves open the mu problem, however. The tenets of supersymmetry are being tested at the LHC, although no evidence has been found so far for supersymmetry.

Each particle that couples to the Higgs field has an associated Yukawa coupling formula_1. The coupling with the Higgs field for fermions gives an interaction term formula_2, with formula_3 being the Dirac field and formula_4 the Higgs field. Also, the mass of a fermion is proportional to its Yukawa coupling, meaning that the Higgs boson will couple most to the most massive particle. This means that the most significant corrections to the Higgs mass will originate from the heaviest particles, most prominently the top quark. By applying the Feynman rules, one gets the quantum corrections to the Higgs mass squared from a fermion to be:

formula_5

The formula_6 is called the ultraviolet cutoff and is the scale up to which the Standard Model is valid. If we take this scale to be the Planck scale, then we have the quadratically diverging Lagrangian. However, suppose there existed two complex scalars (taken to be spin 0) such that:

formula_7

(the couplings to the Higgs are exactly the same).

Then by the Feynman rules, the correction (from both scalars) is:

formula_8

(Note that the contribution here is positive. This is because of the spin-statistics theorem, which means that fermions will have a negative contribution and bosons a positive contribution. This fact is exploited.)

This gives a total contribution to the Higgs mass to be zero if we include both the fermionic and bosonic particles. Supersymmetry is an extension of this that creates &#x27;superpartners&#x27; for all Standard Model particles.

==== Conformal ====
Without supersymmetry, a solution to the hierarchy problem has been proposed using just the Standard Model. The idea can be traced back to the fact that the term in the Higgs field that produces the uncontrolled quadratic correction upon renormalization is the quadratic one. If the Higgs field had no mass term, then no hierarchy problem arises. But by missing a quadratic term in the Higgs field, one must find a way to recover the breaking of electroweak symmetry through a non-null vacuum expectation value. This can be obtained using the Weinberg–Coleman mechanism with terms in the Higgs potential arising from quantum corrections. Mass obtained in this way is far too small with respect to what is seen in accelerator facilities and so a conformal Standard Model needs more than one Higgs particle. This proposal has been put forward in 2006 by Krzysztof Antoni Meissner and Hermann Nicolai and is currently under scrutiny. But if no further excitation is observed beyond the one seen so far at LHC, this model would have to be abandoned.

==== Extra dimensions ====
No experimental or observational evidence of extra dimensions has been officially reported. Analyses of results from the Large Hadron Collider severely constrain theories with large extra dimensions. However, extra dimensions could explain why the gravity force is so weak, and why the expansion of the universe is faster than expected.

If we live in a 3+1 dimensional world, then we calculate the gravitational force via Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity:

formula_9

which is simply Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation. Note that Newton&#x27;s constant can be rewritten in terms of the Planck mass.

formula_10

If we extend this idea to extra dimensions, then we get:

formula_11

where formula_12 is the -dimensional Planck mass. However, we are assuming that these extra dimensions are the same size as the normal 3+1 dimensions. Let us say that the extra dimensions are of size than normal dimensions. If we let , then we get (2). However, if we let , then we get our usual Newton&#x27;s law. However, when , the flux in the extra dimensions becomes a constant, because there is no extra room for gravitational flux to flow through. Thus the flux will be proportional to because this is the flux in the extra dimensions. The formula is:

formula_13

which gives:

formula_14

Thus the fundamental Planck mass (the extra-dimensional one) could actually be small, meaning that gravity is actually strong, but this must be compensated by the number of the extra dimensions and their size. Physically, this means that gravity is weak because there is a loss of flux to the extra dimensions.

==== Braneworld models ====
In 1998 Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, and Gia Dvali proposed the ADD model, also known as the model with large extra dimensions, an alternative scenario to explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other forces. This theory requires that the fields of the Standard Model are confined to a four-dimensional membrane, while gravity propagates in several additional spatial dimensions that are large compared to the Planck scale.

In 1998–99 Merab Gogberashvili published on arXiv (and subsequently in peer-reviewed journals) a number of articles where he showed that if the Universe is considered as a thin shell (a mathematical synonym for &quot;brane&quot;) expanding in 5-dimensional space then it is possible to obtain one scale for particle theory corresponding to the 5-dimensional cosmological constant and Universe thickness, and thus to solve the hierarchy problem. It was also shown that four-dimensionality of the Universe is the result of a stability requirement since the extra component of the Einstein field equations giving the localized solution for matter fields coincides with one of the conditions of stability.

Subsequently, there were proposed the closely related Randall–Sundrum scenarios which offered their solution to the hierarchy problem.

==== UV/IR mixing ====
In 2019, a pair of researchers proposed that IR/UV mixing resulting in the breakdown of the effective quantum field theory could resolve the hierarchy problem. In 2021, another group of researchers showed that UV/IR mixing could resolve the hierarchy problem in string theory.

=== Cosmological constant ===

In physical cosmology, current observations in favor of an accelerating universe imply the existence of a tiny, but nonzero cosmological constant. This problem, called the cosmological constant problem, is a hierarchy problem very similar to that of the Higgs boson mass problem, since the cosmological constant is also very sensitive to quantum corrections, but it is complicated by the necessary involvement of general relativity in the problem. Proposed solutions to the cosmological constant problem include modifying and/or extending gravity, adding matter with unvanishing pressure, and UV/IR mixing in the Standard Model and gravity. Some physicists have resorted to anthropic reasoning to solve the cosmological constant problem, but it is disputed whether anthropic reasoning is scientific.

<doc id="697158" wikidata="Q2393358" url="?curid=697158" title="Dance in the United States">
<text>The United States of America is the home of the hip hop dance, swing, tap dance and its derivative Rock and Roll, and modern square dance (associated with the United States of America due to its historic development in that country—twenty three U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance or official folk dance) and one of the major centers for modern dance. There is a variety of social dance and performance or concert dance forms with also a range of traditions of Native American dances.

The reality shows and competitions &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot;, and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, have broadened the audience for dance.

==African American dance==
African American dances are those vernacular dances which have developed within African American communities in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. African American vernacular dances are usually centered on social dance practice, though performance dance and concert dance often supply complementary aspects to social dancing.

Placing great value on improvisation, African American vernacular dances are characterized by ongoing change and development. Because they exist in social spaces and their main &#x27;purpose&#x27; is self-expression, they are continually changing to reflect the needs, interests and personalities of their participants.

Alvin Ailey and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is an important example of African American involvement in performance or concert dance.

==Swing dance==

The term &quot;swing dance&quot; refers to a group of dances that developed concurrently with jazz music in the 1920s, 30s and 40s. The most iconic among the various styles of swing dance is the Lindy Hop, which originated in Harlem and is still danced today. While the majority of swing dances began in African-American communities as vernacular African-American dances, some forms, like Balboa, developed within Euro-American or other ethnic group communities.

Dances such as the Black Bottom, Charleston, Shag, and Tap Dance travelled north with Dixieland jazz to New York, Kansas City, and Chicago in the Great Migration (African American) of the 1920s, where rural blacks travelled to escape persecution, Jim Crow laws, lynching and unemployment in the South (during the Great Depression).

Swinging jazz music features the syncopated timing associated with African American and West African music and dance—a combination of crotchets and quavers which many swing dancers interpret as &#x27;triple steps&#x27; and &#x27;steps&#x27; — yet also introduces changes in the &quot;way&quot; these rhythms were played—a distinct delay or &#x27;relaxed&#x27; approach to timing.

Swing dance is now found globally, with great variety in their preferences for particular dances.

==Modern dance==
American modern dance developed in the early 20th century alongside American music. Among the pioneers of modern dance were Isadora Duncan, the dance company of Ruth St. Denis and her husband-partner, Ted Shawn, and their pupils Doris Humphrey and Martha Graham. The early modern dance makers broke with European classical forms by giving into the weight of gravity, initiating movement from the center rather than the limbs, and emphasizing an emotional directness in their choreography. Many of Graham&#x27;s most popular works were produced in collaboration with leading American composers -- &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; with Aaron Copland, for example.

Later choreographers, Merce Cunningham introduced chance procedures and composition by field, and Alvin Ailey incorporated African dance elements and black music into his works. Recently, Mark Morris and Liz Lerman have shown that graceful, exciting movement is not restricted by age or body type.

==Dance and society==

Dance is ingrained in society through events, the media, and awards like the Grammy Awards, the Golden Globes, and the MTV video music awards which feature dancing.

Some popular competition televised events that are made for dance are &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot;. These dancing shows allow society to interact with them, choosing who they think suits best in the competition.

Popular songs like Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;, The Harlem Shake, and &quot;Teach me how to dougie&quot; have influenced dance moves that became trends in society. In social gatherings people may dance folk dances, ballroom dances, casual dances, or modern dances like hip-hop.

<text>The Yamhill River is an tributary of the Willamette River, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Formed by the confluence of the South Yamhill River and the North Yamhill River about east of McMinnville, it drains part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. The river meanders east past Dayton to join the Willamette River at its river mile (RM) 55 or river kilometer (RK) 89, south of Newberg.

It is likely that Yamhill was the 19th century white settlers&#x27; name for a tribe of Native Americans, a Kalapuya people who inhabited the region. The Yamhill people were among 27 bands and tribes moved to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, formally established in 1857.

==Course==
Formed by the confluence of the South Yamhill and North Yamhill rivers about east of McMinnville, the main stem Yamhill River flows generally east for about to the Willamette River, a tributary of the Columbia River. At about RM 9 (RK 14), Hawn Creek and then Millican Creek enter from the as the Yamhill nears Lafayette, which lies to the river&#x27;s left. Beyond Lafayette, Henry Creek enters from the left. Near Dayton, the river passes under Oregon Route 18 before skirting the city, which lies to its at RM 5 (RK 8). Here Palmer Creek enters from the right. Below Dayton, the river enters the Willamette at its RM 55 (RK 89) south of Newberg.

==Lock and dam==

In 1900 a Yamhill River lock and dam lock and dam was completed about 1.5 miles downriver from Lafayette, Oregon. The lock was decommissioned in 1954. The dam was deliberately destroyed in 1963 to allow better passage for salmon on the river. The site of the lock and dam is now a county park.

<text>Katakolo () is a seaside village in the municipality of Pyrgos in western Elis, Greece. It is situated on a headland overlooking the Ionian Sea and separating the Gulf of Kyparissia from the rest of the Ionian. It is west of Pyrgos. The small village of Agios Andreas, which in ancient times was the natural harbour for Ancient Olympia, lies northwest of Katakolo.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, Katakolo was the site of the fortress of Pontikon or Pontikokastro (Ποντικόν, Ποντικόκαστρο), which the Frankish rulers of the Principality of Achaea called &quot;Beauvoir&quot; or &quot;Belveder&quot;. The fortress was built by the Byzantines and taken over by the Franks ca. 1205.

==Climate==
Katakolo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot, dry summers and mild winters with significant rainfall.


==Visitor attractions==
The port of Katakolo is a popular stop for cruise ships, offering an opportunity for passengers to visit the site of Olympia. Low hills with forests surround Katakolo. Visitors here have the opportunity to visit the ancient port of Olympia, the sunken ancient city of Pheia. Ancient Pheia was on the other side of the mountain of Ichthys, now Agios Andreas, within walking distance of Katakolo port. The lighthouse of Katakolo was built in 1865. One of the most important sites of Katakolo is the Museum of Ancient Greek Technology.

Katakolo has a big market. It consists of more than sixty shops. Cafeterias, restaurants, clothing and traditional Greek products.

The remains of the medieval Pontikokastro/Belvedere/Beauvoir castle still stand on a hilltop northeast of the modern port, but the castle is mostly ruined and its original appearance can only be surmised.

==Historical population==
==Transport==
===Rail===
A railway station connects Katakolo with Pyrgos and Olympia.

<doc id="697166" wikidata="Q5579121" url="?curid=697166" title="Golden Age of Freethought">
<text>The Golden Age of Freethought is the mid 19th-century period in United States history which saw the development of the socio-political movement promoting freethought. Anti-authoritarian and intellectually liberating historical eras had existed many times in history, notably in eighteenth century France. But the period roughly from 1875 to 1914 is referred to by at least one contemporary writer as &quot;the high-water mark of freethought as an influential movement in American society&quot;. It began around 1856 and lasted at least through the end of the century; author Susan Jacoby places the end of the Golden Age at the start of World War I.

Freethought is a philosophical position that holds that ideas and opinions should be based on science and reason, and not restricted by authority, tradition, or religion. It is characteristic of the 18th century Enlightenment but hardly confined to any one epoch or place. The late nineteenth century American Golden Age was encouraged by the lectures of the extremely popular agnostic orator Robert Green Ingersoll, the popularization of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the push for women&#x27;s suffrage, and other political, scientific, and social trends that clashed with religious orthodoxy and caused people to question the traditional ideas about the world that they encountered in received opinion.

A freethinker of the late 19th century could have been someone from any of the varied religious and political backgrounds. Charles Knowlton, D. M. Bennett, and Ingersoll were influential freethinkers of the period.

Robert G. Ingersoll (1833–1899) was one of the more prominent freethinkers of his time. He was known as the &quot;Great Agnostic&quot;. Ingersoll, a lawyer, an orator and a Civil War veteran, is famous for his skeptical approaches to popular religious beliefs. He would speak in public about orthodox views and would often poke fun at them. Guests would pay $1 to hear him speak (). Ingersoll was the leader of the American Secular Union, successor organization to the National Liberal League.

Charles Knowlton was born into a Puritan household in 1800. The science and medicine practiced around this time was known as &quot;heroic&quot;. Heroic medicinal treatment was rather medieval and consisted of blood-letting, and induced vomiting and profuse sweating. These treatments, far from being restorative, usually actually proved harmful to patients. Knowlton had wet dreams in his adolescence, leading him to be the subject of many types of heroic treatment. The revulsion that these interventions induced in him prompted him to pursue humane approaches to treatment. Believing that effective and healthy treatment must be founded on a sound understanding of human anatomy, he began body snatching from graves and studying the bodies he exhumed. Knowlton was imprisoned for this. On release his concern for the introduction of more humane medicine was undimmed. He became a doctor, putting his scientific findings into his practice. He also married into a family of freethinkers.

Knowlton wrote &quot;Elements of Modern Materialism&quot; and &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot; in 1832. The second would prove much more successful. The book included a spermicidal method which he had invented.

<text>The Roland JX-3P is a synthesizer produced by Roland Corporation of Japan from 1983–1985. The &quot;3P&quot; in its name refers to &quot;Programmable Preset Polyphonic&quot;. It is notable as one of the company&#x27;s first synthesizers (along with the Jupiter-6) to incorporate a MIDI interface.

==Features==

The JX-3P is a six-note polyphonic, 2 DCOs, 61 key synthesizer with sawtooth, 50 and 10% pulse waveforms, and a noise generator. It has 32 factory programs in ROM, and user memory for 32 programs.

The JX-3P also features a built-in 128-step polyphonic sequencer that can be synchronized to external devices, such as drum machines, connected to its simple clock pulse input jack. MIDI clock synchronization is not supported.

As one of the earliest MIDI devices, the JX-3P&#x27;s MIDI implementation is basic, supporting only note on/off, pitch bend, hold, modulation and program change messages. Neither &quot;System Exclusive&quot; nor &quot;Continuous Controllers&quot; (CC) are implemented, so external patch storage or real-time parameter updates are not possible through MIDI (except with third-party upgrades).

The JX-3P is fully programmable from its front panel. To do so, each synthesis parameter must be selected numerically, then its value can be adjusted with a single slider. For a more immediate programming experience, Roland offered the optional PG-200 &quot;programmer,&quot; a simple control surface with dedicated switches and potentiometers for editing each of the JX-3P&#x27;s parameters. The PG-200 connects to the synthesizer through a proprietary interface and provides hardware sliders dedicated to most JX-3P parameters for editing patches. It is not possible to use the PG-200 and the MIDI interface at the same time, however. The PG-200 programmer also served to edit patches for the Roland GR-700 Guitar Synthesizer, which shares the same voice architecture and sound engine as the JX-3P.

==Juno series lineage==

The JX-3P&#x27;s architecture is similar to the Juno series synths produced around the same time. Both machines employ the same interval-timer DCO technology, use the Roland IR3109 low-pass filter, a discrete VCA, and have an on-board stereo chorus effect. The JX-3P has a single ADSR envelope generator and a single modulation oscillator - both software-generated (while the Juno-6 and Juno-60 use analogue circuitry for the envelope generator).

The JX-3P had two distinct DCOs with detuning and several cross-modulation modes, as opposed to the single DCO with sub-oscillator design of the Juno line. Also unlike the Juno, the JX-3P allows the pitch of either oscillator to be controlled by its envelope generator and lfo. Juno features lacking in the JX-3P include portamento and a second chorus mode.

==Variants and aftermarket upgrades==

Roland also produced a rackmount synthesizer similar to the JX-3P, the MKS-30 Planet-S. Unlike the JX-3P, the MKS-30 would respond to velocity (dynamics) via MIDI, and can receive MIDI notes while simultaneously working with the PG-200 programmer.

There is an EPROM version available at Roland, which enables MIDI reception of note velocity. There is an add-on kit available from Series Circuits (see link below), which enables parallel usage of PG-200 and MIDI and also introduces parameter control via MIDI controller data (and includes the functionality of the Roland EPROM update). The New Zealand based company Kiwitechnics offers an upgrade kit called &quot;Kiwi-3P&quot; which significantly enhances the functionality of the JX-3P.

<text>In physics, length scale is a particular length or distance determined with the precision of at most a few orders of magnitude. The concept of length scale is particularly important because physical phenomena of different length scales cannot affect each other and are said to decouple. The decoupling of different length scales makes it possible to have a self-consistent theory that only describes the relevant length scales for a given problem. Scientific reductionism says that the physical laws on the shortest length scales can be used to derive the effective description at larger length scales. 
The idea that one can derive descriptions of physics at different length scales from one another can be quantified with the renormalization group.

In quantum mechanics the length scale of a given phenomenon is related to its de Broglie wavelength
, where &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant and &quot;p&quot; is the momentum that is being probed. In relativistic mechanics time and length scales are related by the speed of light. In relativistic quantum mechanics or relativistic quantum field theory, length scales are related to momentum, time and energy scales through the Planck constant and the speed of light. Often in high energy physics natural units are used where length, time, energy and momentum scales are described in the same units (usually with units of energy such as GeV).

Length scales are usually the operative scale (or at least one of the scales) in dimensional analysis. For instance, in scattering theory, the most common quantity to calculate is a cross section which has units of length squared and is measured in barns. The cross section of a given process is usually the square of the length scale.

== Examples ==
* The atomic length scale is and is given by the size of hydrogen atom (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the Bohr radius, approximately ).
* The length scale for the strong interactions (or the one derived from QCD through dimensional transmutation) is around , and the &quot;radii&quot; of strongly interacting particles (such as the proton) are roughly comparable. This length scale is determined by the range of the Yukawa potential. The lifetimes of strongly interacting particles, such as the rho meson, are given by this length scale divided by the speed of light: . The masses of strongly interacting particles are several times the associated energy scale ( to ).
* The electroweak length scale is shorter, roughly and is set by the rest mass of the weak vector bosons, which is roughly . This length scale would be the distance where a Yukawa force is mediated by the weak vector bosons. The magnitude of weak length scale was initially inferred by the Fermi constant measured by neutron and muon decay.
* The Planck length (Planck scale) is much shorter yet – about , and is derived from the Newtonian constant of gravitation.
* The mesoscopic scale is the length at which quantum mechanical behaviours in liquids or solid can be described by macroscopic concepts.

<text>Theodorick Bland (March 21, 1741June 1, 1790), also known as Theodorick Bland, Jr., was an American planter, physician, soldier, and politician from Prince George County, Virginia. A major figure in the formation of the new United States government, Bland represented Virginia in both the Continental Congress and the United States House of Representatives (until his death in office), as well as served multiple terms in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Prince George County, which he also represented in the Virginia Ratification Convention (and unsuccessfully opposed ratification).

==Early life and education==
Bland was born in Prince George County in 1741 to a prominent planter family in colonial Virginia. His parents were Theodorick Bland of Cawsons and Frances Elizabeth (Bolling) Bland. His mother was the only child and heir of Captain Drury Bolling and Elizabeth Meriweather of &quot;Kippax,&quot; which plantation the younger Theodorick subsequently inherited and operated.

His ancestors had settled in Virginia years earlier, became civic leaders (hence sometimes referred to as the First Families of Virginia) and prospered by operating plantations using enslaved labor. Like his father (who served in the initial Virginia Senate during the American Revolutionary War representing Prince George County and nearly Isle of Wight and Surry Counties), he was named after Theodorick Bland of Westover, who had served as Speaker of the House of Burgesses in 1660 and also represented Charles City County then new Henrico County) from 1661 until his death, probably in 1672. His grandfather, Richard Bland, had married Elizabeth Randolph, daughter of William Randolph of Turkey Island. His uncle, also named Richard Bland, his father&#x27;s first cousin Peyton Randolph, and his second cousin Thomas Jefferson would precede him in being elected to state legislative posts as well as Congress.

At age 11, after being tutored at home as was customary for his class, he was sent to Great Britain for his education, accompanied by an enslaved boy, Tom, as his body servant. Bland studied first in Yorkshire. Next he went to Scotland to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating as a doctor in 1763.

==Early career and marriage==
Bland then returned to Virginia and began a medical practice, as well as following family traditions of political involvement and farming using enslaved labor. He married Martha Daingerfield in 1768 and they likely settled at Kippax about that time. (His parents had moved to Cawsons.) Thus Bland became a planter and major slaveholder. Bland retired from medical practice in the late 1760s, &quot;in favor of farming and politics&quot;. He became active in politics before the war, serving as the Clerk of Prince George County.

==Revolutionary War==
As the Revolution neared, Bland&#x27;s Whig views aligned him with the rebels. He or his father published letters criticizing Lord Dunmore in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Cassius&quot;. In 1775 Bland joined the local &quot;Committee of Intelligence&quot; as well as helped locate arms and munitions for the patriot cause. In June 1776, Bland accepted a commission as captain in Virginia&#x27;s cavalry. He rose quickly to Colonel and commanded the 1st Continental Light Dragoons, often cited as &quot;Bland&#x27;s Virginia Horse&quot; in Revolutionary dispatches and correspondence. In the latter capacity Bland reported directly to General Washington. He would retire in 1779 from active cavalry service due to poor health, which he had suffered from his youth.

Bland&#x27;s observations at Brandywine supplied General Washington with the correct location of Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s and Howe&#x27;s main armies; Bland wrote two separate dispatches, and Col. James Ross of the 8th Pennsylvania wrote another dispatch reporting on British troop movements. Both men&#x27;s dispatches supported that of Col. Hazen. However, their dispatches were initially misinterpreted, until it was almost too late. Without the accurate contributions of Bland, Ross, and Hazen, a worse result might have befallen Washington&#x27;s army at Brandywine.
Some later accounts have Bland&#x27;s Virginia Horse subsequently assigned to scouting duty. In his 1922 biography of John Randolph, the historian William Cabell Bruce suggested that the Brandywine incident encouraged Washington to use his cavalries more for scouting rather than sitting in formation on the front lines, as they had at Brandywine. However, the lack of scouting had led to the Brandywine errors.

At Gen. Washington&#x27;s request, when Bland returned to Virginia to recuperate in 1779, he also served as Warden at Charlottesville over British officers taken prisoner. He also worked to keep Washington&#x27;s officers and cavalry supplied with quality horses both from his own stables and from others. As a participant in the early American horse-racing community, Bland owned a large stable and had access to other horses through relatives and friends. Bland had earlier retired from his active medical practice for the same health issues in the late 1760s, nearly a decade before the war had begun, and finally was allowed to retire from the military for health reasons in late 1779. He did, however, in 1785, accept a commission from Gov. Patrick Henry as the Prince George County Lieutenant, with military responsibilities.

==Planter==
As a planter like his father, grandfather and namesake, Bland cultivated tobacco, indigo and wheat. In the 1787 Virginia tax census, he owned 18 enslaved Blacks at least 16 years old, and 13 under that age, as well as 11 horses, 21 cattle and a 4-wheeled chariot. As mentioned below, his father had moved to Amelia County after the conflict, but died before that tax census. Thus, his father&#x27;s estate also owned 13 enslaved adult Blacks in Amelia County, Virginia, as well as 10 younger slaves and four horses.

==Politician==
Bland&#x27;s political career had begun before the Revolution, when he served as the Clerk of Prince George County, and had considerable contact with the House of Burgesses. Following the war, Bland continued as the county&#x27;s Clerk, which caused him to communicate with the Virginia General Assembly, in which his father served in the Virginia Senate and Edmund Bland served in the Virginia House of Delegates. In 1780, the General Assembly named Bland as one of Virginia&#x27;s delegates to the Continental Congress, where he served until 1783 and thus helped form the new United States government.

After his father moved to Amelia County, Bland took over Cawsons (apparently about 1783-1784 after his return to Virginia from the Continental Congress and his father&#x27;s death.) Bland then operated Kippax as an out-plantation.

In 1786, Bland was elected to the Virginia House, where he served until 1788.

In 1788, Prince George voters elected Bland and Ruffin as their delegate to the Virginia Convention called to ratify the United States Constitution. Bland voted against ratification, as he believed it yielded too much power to a central government.

After the constitution was adopted, Virginia legislators elected to Bland the First United States Congress (he ran unopposed). He served in the House of Representatives from March 4, 1789, until his death in 1790 at the age of 49. He died while attending the Congress in New York City, and William B. Giles of Amelia County was selected as his successor. Bland was the first member of House of Representatives to die in office. William Branch Giles completed his term.

==Death and legacy==

Bland was originally buried in New York&#x27;s Trinity Churchyard in Lower Manhattan. (Trinity Church was designated in the late 20th century as a National Historic Landmark). In 1828, his remains were moved and reinterred in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

His wife Martha Bland survived him and married two more times. She was an independent woman, maintaining the Bland holdings by executing marriage contracts to control her own lands.

Bland bequeathed 2 acres of land on Blandford Hill next to the church to create a school to educate youth, but insisted that it be established within 15 years of his death, which bequest lapsed because no school was constructed.

Although the buildings of Kippax Plantation are long gone, and the town of Hopewell grew on the site, it has recently been purchased by the Archaeological Conservancy, and archaeological excavations are ongoing.

<text>Queens Village is a mostly residential middle class neighborhood in the eastern part of the New York City borough of Queens. It is bound by Hollis to the west, Cambria Heights to the south, Bellerose, Queens and Elmont, Nassau County to the east, and Oakland Gardens to the north.

Shopping in the community is located along Braddock Avenue, Hillside Avenue, Hempstead Avenue, Jamaica Avenue (NY 25), Francis Lewis Boulevard, and Springfield Boulevard. Located just east of Queens Village, in Elmont, Nassau County, is the Belmont Park race track.

Close to the neighborhood are Cunningham Park and Alley Pond Park, as well as the historic Long Island Motor Parkway (LIMP), home of the turn of the century racing competition, the Vanderbilt Cup. The LIMP was built by William Kissam Vanderbilt, a descendant of the family that presided over the New York Central Railroad and Western Union; it is now part of the Brooklyn–Queens Greenway.

Queens Village is located in Queens Community District 13 and its ZIP Codes are 11427, 11428, and 11429. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 105th Precinct. Politically, Queens Village is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 23rd District.

==History==
Queens Village was founded as Little Plains in the 1640s. Homage to this part of Queens Village history is found on the sign above the Long Island Railroad Station there. In 1824, Thomas Brush established a blacksmith shop in the area. He prospered and built several other shops and a factory, and the area soon became known as Brushville. On March 1, 1837, the railroad arrived. The first station in the area was called Flushing Avenue in 1837, Delancy Avenue by June 20, 1837, and Brushville by November 27, 1837,
likely about a mile west of the present station. In 1856, residents voted to change the name from Brushville to Queens.
The name &quot;Inglewood&quot; also was used for both the village and the train station in the 1860s and 1870s.
The name &quot;Brushville&quot; was still used in an 1860 &quot;New York Times&quot; article,
but both &quot;Queens&quot; and &quot;Brushville&quot; are used in an 1870 article.
Maps from 1873 show portions of Queens Village (then called Inglewood and Queens) in the town of Hempstead, but 1891 maps show it entirely in the town of Jamaica.

After the Borough of Queens became incorporated as part of the City of Greater New York in 1898, and the new county of Nassau was created in 1899, the border between the city and Nassau County was set directly east of Queens Village. A 1901 article in the Brooklyn Eagle already uses the full name &quot;Queens Village&quot;,
a name that had been used as late as the 1880s for Lloyd&#x27;s Neck in present-day Suffolk County. In 1923, the Long Island Railroad added &quot;Village&quot; to its station&#x27;s name to avoid confusion with the county of the same name, and thus the neighborhood became known as Queens Village.

Queens Village was part of an overall housing boom that was spreading east through Queens from New York as people from the city sought the bucolic life afforded by the less-crowded atmosphere of the area. Today, many of those charming and well-maintained Dutch Colonial and Tudor homes built in Queens Village during the 1920s and 1930s continue to attract a diverse population.

===Other Queens Village on Long Island===
Lloyd Harbor, New York, which was formerly in Queens County but now in Suffolk County, was known as Queens Village from 1685 until as late as 1883. In 1885, known then as Lloyd Neck, it seceded from Queens County and became part of the town of Huntington in Suffolk County.

==Subsections==

===Bellaire===
Bellaire is in western Queens Village next to Hollis and covers the area surrounding Jamaica Avenue and 211th Street. Bellaire is the largest section of Queens Village. The area considered Bellaire usually falls under the general title of Queens Village. There was once a Long Island Rail Road station named Bellaire. 211th Street, formerly known as Belleaire Boulevard has traffic medians on it indicating its history as the main route through this section of Queens Village.

===Hollis Hills===

Hollis Hills is an affluent subsection, generally bounded by Springfield Boulevard to the east, Grand Central Parkway the south, Hollis Hills Terrace to the west, and Kingsbury Avenue and Richland Avenue the north. It is slightly above sea level due to a retreating glacier from the last Ice Age. A small pond called Potamogeton Pond exists at Bell Boulevard on the north side of Grand Central Parkway.

Most homes in Hollis Hills are of the Colonial, Tudor, and Ranch styles. Houses here attract predominantly the upper-middle class as some houses in the area can fetch prices of $1,500,000 or higher. This neighborhood, similar to Douglaston, is a quasi-suburb, with detached homes sitting on large tree-lined lots. Surrey Estates, a section of Hollis Hills, is a smaller triangle of architecturally notable homes surrounded by old, large trees and is bound by Union Turnpike, Springfield Boulevard, and Hartland Avenue within Hollis Hills.

Notable institutions in Hollis Hills are The Chapel of the Redeemer Lutheran, Hollis Hills Jewish Center (founded in 1948), American Martyrs Catholic Church, the Windsor Park Branch of the Queens Public Library, the John Hamburg Community Center, Kingsbury Elementary School (P.S. 188), Hollis Hills Civic Association, and Surrey Estates Homeowners Association.

<doc id="697193" wikidata="Q1856630" url="?curid=697193" title="Hi-de-Hi!">
<text>Hi-de-Hi! is a British sitcom created by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, and produced for the BBC. The programme initially began with a pilot on 1 January 1980 and aired for nine series between 26 February 1981 and 30 January 1988, and starred Paul Shane, Su Pollard, Jeffrey Holland, Ruth Madoc and Simon Cadell.

Inspired by Perry&#x27;s time serving as a Redcoat at Butlin&#x27;s, the series takes place within the fictional Maplins holiday camp in Essex towards the end of the traditional British holiday period of the 1950s. The episodes themselves focus on the lives of the camp&#x27;s entertainers and staff, who frequently greet campers with the titular phrase &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;, and consist mostly of struggling actors, comedians, wannabe stars, and has-been entertainers.

The programme proved popular from its launch, gaining large audiences during its broadcast; its popularity helped it to win a BAFTA as Best Comedy Series in 1984. In a 2008 poll on Channel 4, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; was voted the 35th most popular comedy catchphrase. By 2015, the series began receiving repeats, initially with the BBC alongside other sitcom classics by Croft and Perry, and subsequently moved onto being repeated on Gold.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; is set within a holiday camp situated in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, Essex, covering the summer holiday seasons of 1959 and 1960. Owned by Maplins, run by the enigmatic owner Joe Maplin, the camp operates in a similar manner to real-life holiday camps, including providing entertainment and activities through its staff of Yellowcoats – a parody of the real-life Redcoats, Bluecoats, and Greencoats. The Yellowcoats are led by Ted Bovis, the camp host, and consist of three different groups of entertainers: the young, who see the job as a lucky break into showbusiness; the middle-aged, who are realistic about their prospects but still cling to the hope that they can still achieve fame; and the veterans, the oldest members of staff who see their job as a step down from former stardom glories.

Many of the stories focus on the relationships between the characters, the constant issues that arise from Ted&#x27;s attempts to scam the camp&#x27;s holidaymakers, and other issues sometimes brought on by Maplin himself. The sitcom notably focused on a common theme in stories surrounding the erosion of class boundaries during the post-war period and attitudes of staff towards each other – a recurring element in stories is chalet maid Peggy Ollerenshaw&#x27;s desire to be a Yellowcoat and the dislike Yellowcoat Sports Organiser Gladys Pugh has towards this idea.

==Cast==
* Paul Shane as Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Bovis – The Camp&#x27;s Entertainment Host, and a former entertainer. Tasked with greeting and entertaining campers, but also secretly runs scams and rackets to make money on the side. After the show concluded in 1988, Shane would be one of several cast members to work on later sitcoms by Croft.
* Ruth Madoc as Gladys Pugh – The Camp&#x27;s radio announcer and sports organiser. The writers devised her to be the romantic foils for the entertainment managers throughout the series, while being snobbish around the Yellowcoats and Peggy.
* Jeffrey Holland as Spike Dixon – The camp&#x27;s chief comic for the 1959 and 1960 season, acting as Ted&#x27;s conscience during times when his scheming could lead to trouble. Holland would join with Shane on working on further sitcoms made by Croft following &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;
* Su Pollard as Peggy Ollerenshaw – A chalet maid at Maplins, with dreams of becoming a Yellowcoat and achieving stardom. This dream became a recurring element in some of the stories for &quot;Hi-de-Hi&quot;. Like Shane, she would continue to work on further sitcoms by Croft after the programme concluded.
* Simon Cadell as Professor Jeffrey Fairbrother (Series 1–5) – The camp&#x27;s entertainment manager for the 1959 season; a former archaeology professor from Cambridge University, who takes the job to escape academia and meet &quot;real people&quot;. However, he struggles to adapt and is wooden when making speeches or presenting to campers. Cadell left the sitcom after the fifth series to focus on other projects.
* Felix Bowness as Fred Quilley – The camp&#x27;s riding instructor for horse rides, and a former race jockey. Bowness would join in with Croft&#x27;s later sitcoms following &quot;Hi-de-Hi&quot;, but would have less prominence as a recurring guest star.
* Diane Holland as Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves – An upper-class dance instructor, part of a husband-and-wife pair of former ballroom champions. Yvonne sees herself as a cut above the rest of the campers - and even her husband Barry.
* Barry Howard as Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Series 1–7) – Yvonne&#x27;s husband and dance partner. Like Yvonne, he presents an upper-class demeanour; however, she is quick to remind him of his lowlier root, as well as his real name, &quot;Bert Pratt&quot;. Although popular with viewers for his deadpan attitude while in character, Howard had to leave the show due to personal problems.
* Leslie Dwyer as Mr William Partridge (Series 1–6) – A children&#x27;s entertainer, working as &quot;Whimsical Willie&quot; the Punch and Judy man at Maplins, who has a drinking problem and a dislike of children. Formerly a music hall performer, his career was cut short by World War I and he has remained bitter ever since. Dwyer was forced to drop out midway through the production of the sixth series due to his declining health, and the writers worked to write his character out of the sitcom in response, where he faked his death to run away with a barmaid.
* Nikki Kelly as Sylvia Garnsey – A female Yellowcoat staff member, with a flirtatious behaviour with the camp&#x27;s entertainment managers. The writers devised Kelly&#x27;s character to be a constant foil towards that of Madoc&#x27;s character, with the sitcom exploring their relationship over the two holiday seasons.
* David Griffin as Clive Dempster (Series 6–9) – The camp&#x27;s entertainment manager for the 1960 season; an upper-class former wartime hero. Although sharing a similar background to his predecessor, Dempster had a slightly shifty nature with money, and was not above getting involved with Ted&#x27;s schemes. Griffin was brought in to replace Cadell following his departure.
* Ben Aris as Julian Dalrymple-Sykes (Series 5, Series 8–9) – A dance instructor and a former lover of Yvonne, brought in to replace Barry after his departure. Aris initially made a guest appearance in the fifth series, and was considered the best choice to replace Howard after his departure.
* Kenneth Connor as Sammy Morris (Series 7, Series 8–9) – A shady children&#x27;s entertainer, brought into replace Partidge during the 1960 season. Connor was brought in to replace Dwyer following his departure, initially having a guest appearance in the seventh series, before joining the cast for the final two series of the sitcom.
* David Webb as Stanley Mathews, and Tony Webb as Bruce Mathews – Identical twin brother Yellowcoats. Both David and Tony maintained minor roles to begin with, but with given more involvement by the third series. In the credits, both brothers are referred to as &quot;The Webb Twins&quot;.
* Chris Andrews as Gary Bolton – A male Yellowcoat staff member. Originally portrayed by Terence Creasy in the pilot, the character was unnamed to begin with and played a minor role, before writers gave Andrews more prominence by the start of the third series.
* Rikki Howard as Betty Whistler (Series 1–5) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1959 holiday season, with a strong dislike of Gladys&#x27; overbearing nature towards herself and some of the other female staff. Howard left the sitcom after the fifth series for unknown reasons.
* Susan Beagley as Tracey Bentwood (Series 3–5) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1959 holiday season, who, like Betty, clashes with Gladys&#x27; personality on the camp. Like Rikki Howard, Beagley left the sitcom for unknown reasons after the fifth series.
* Linda Regan as April Wingate (Series 6–9) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1960 holiday season, with a somewhat childish personality. Writers devised the character to be a love interest for Spike, with a number of stories looking in to the development of their relationship with each other.
* Laura Jackson as Dawn Freshwater (Series 6–9) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1960 holiday season. Jackson&#x27;s character was devised by the writers to be similar to that of previous Yellowcoat women, but with a secret attraction to Dempster during the final holiday season for the camp.
* Penny Irving as Mary (Series 1) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1959 holiday season, she only appears in series 1.
* Gail Harrison as Val (Series 2) – A female Yellowcoat staff member for the 1959 holiday season, she only appears in series 2.
* Gavin Richards as Harold Fox (Series 5–7) – The General Manager of Maplin&#x27;s, known as the &quot;Smiling Viper.&quot;
* Ewan Hooper as Alec Foster (Series 8–9) – Maplin&#x27;s Camp Controller, abusing his power at every turn until Sammy Morris gets him recalled to Head Office.

==Production==
===Filming===
&quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; relied on BBC studios for interior scenes for the entertainment staff building and interior chalet rooms, but much of the exterior scenes for Maplins were shot at Warners&#x27; former holiday camp that operated within the town of Dovercourt near Harwich, Essex; the site is now a housing estate after the camp was closed in 1990. During the pilot episode and the first two series, filming at the camp was done in early spring before the main holiday period for the public during the summer months – the temperature at the time led to complaints by cast members; Jeffrey Holland in particular had to be treated for hypothermia owing to scenes that saw him thrown into the camp&#x27;s pool. Other locations around Essex were used during the show&#x27;s filming, including around the town of Manningtree; and a couple of episodes were filmed at Weybourne railway station on the North Norfolk Railway (also used in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;).

==Episodes==

A pilot episode for the sitcom was first broadcast on 1 January 1980. &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; was later greenlighted to additional episodes, running for 60 episodes over nine series, between 26 February 1981 and 30 January 1988. Unusually, the third and fourth series were actually run back-to-back by the BBC; all subsequent reruns separated the episodes.

==The stage show==
&quot;Hi-de-Hi&quot; was made into a musical, called &quot;Hi-de-Hi – The Holiday Musical&quot;, in the early years of the show. Labelled as a &quot;summer pantomime&quot; by its critics, the production featured most of the TV cast plus several new characters. It did not follow the television storylines, but it was a success nonetheless. It did a summer season in Bournemouth in 1983, a Christmas season in London in 1983 and a summer season in Blackpool in 1984. It was short-lived, however, when some of the cast complained that filming the TV series and doing the summer show limited their offers of acting jobs elsewhere.

At the height of its audience ratings, the BBC had plans to make it into a feature film, but this did not come to fruition.

In August 2009, a &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; stage show toured in Torquay.

In March 2010 the show was revived for a six-month national tour produced by Bruce James Productions Limited and written by Paul Carpenter and Ian Gower, adapting scenes and storylines from episodes of the television series including &quot;A Night Not To Remember&quot; and &quot;Maplin Intercontinental&quot;. The audience were treated as campers during scenes involving camp entertainment which included musical numbers and audience participation. The production starred two members of the original cast, Barry Howard, reprising his role of Barry Stuart-Hargreaves, and Nikki Kelly, originally Sylvia, taking the role of Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves. The tour also starred Peter Amory as Jeffrey Fairbrother, Abigail Finley as Peggy Ollerenshaw, Rebecca Bainbridge as Gladys Pugh, Damian Williams as Ted Bovis, Ben Roddy as Spike Dixon, Richard Colson as William Partridge, Andrew Fettes as Fred Quilley, Kate Burrell as Sylvia Garnsey, Lauren Harrison as Betty Whistler and Carrie Laurence as Tracey Bentwood. Several performances of the tour had to be cancelled due to low ticket sales despite positive reviews.

Following the end of the tour an amended version of the script was made available for amateur performances. The script lacks many of the camp entertainment scenes, including the musical numbers, whilst adding a subplot featuring Ted&#x27;s ex-wife from the episode &quot;Trouble and Strife&quot;. The original tour set and costumes are available for hire from Bruce Jones Productions Limited.

Amateur productions include those by the Teignmouth Players Amateur Dramatic Society at the Carlton Theatre, Teignmouth, The Western College Players at the Drum Theatre, Plymouth, (both in July 2011), and The Halifax Thespians at the Halifax Playhouse in March 2012. In May 2019, the Brookside Theatre, Romford staged a production. It was staged by The Crowborough Players in May 2013.

A stage play for amateur production by Paul Carpenter and Ian Gower was originally available from Samuel French Ltd of London but now licensed in the UK by Concord Theatricals.

==Theme music and merchandise==
&quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; had a rock and roll style theme tune called &quot;Holiday Rock&quot;. Sung by Ken Barrie, who would later provide the voice of Postman Pat, on the series opening titles, the song was later released as a single with the main vocal part sung by Paul Shane and the Yellowcoats (it featured several members of the cast on backing vocals). It became a UK Top 40 hit in May 1981.

&quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; was one of the first BBC shows to capitalise on the merchandise market, with products such as board games, albums, books, toys and T-shirts available to buy.

==After &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;==

Several principal cast members were reunited in another period piece by the same writers called &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot;, which piloted in 1988, and ran for four series to 1993, and again in &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot; by David Croft and Richard Spendlove from 1995 for two series.

==Home releases==
Series One and Series Two, including the pilot, were released in a boxed set by Universal Playback on 3 March 2003, followed by a boxed set of Series Three and Series Four on 5 April 2004. The Series 5 and Series 6 was released in a boxed set on 23 October 2006. Universal Playback encountered problems when releasing the first four series on DVD because they did not hold the rights to the soundtrack. As a result, some of the episodes were edited. Series Seven was released on 5 May 2008. Series Eight and Series Nine were released in a double pack on 22 September 2008. A complete boxed set containing all 9 series has also been released.

<doc id="697208" wikidata="Q10916362" url="?curid=697208" title="Dizziness">
<text>Dizziness is an imprecise term that can refer to a sense of disorientation in space, vertigo, or lightheadedness. It can also refer to disequilibrium or a non-specific feeling, such as giddiness or foolishness.

Dizziness is a common medical complaint, affecting 20–30% of persons. Dizziness is broken down into four main subtypes: vertigo (~25–50%), disequilibrium (less than ~15%), presyncope (less than ~15%), and nonspecific dizziness (~10%).
* Vertigo is the sensation of spinning or having one&#x27;s surroundings spin about them. Many people find vertigo very disturbing and often report associated nausea and vomiting.
* Presyncope describes lightheadedness or feeling faint; the name relates to syncope, which is actually fainting.
* Disequilibrium is the sensation of being off balance and is most often characterized by frequent falls in a specific direction. This condition is not often associated with nausea or vomiting.
* Non-specific dizziness may be psychiatric in origin. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and can sometimes be brought about by hyperventilation.

==Mechanism and causes==
Many conditions cause dizziness because multiple parts of the body are required for maintaining balance including the inner ear, eyes, muscles, skeleton, and the nervous system. Thus dizziness can be caused by a variety of problems and may reflect a focal process (such as one affecting balance or coordination) or a diffuse one (such as a toxic exposure or low perfusion state).

Common causes of dizziness include:
* Inadequate blood supply to the brain due to:
** A sudden fall in blood pressure
** Heart problems or artery blockages
** Anaemias, such as vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, iron deficiency anemia
* Loss or distortion of vision or visual cues
* Standing too quickly/prolonged standing
* Disorders of the inner ear
* Dehydration
* Distortion of brain/nervous function by medications such as anticonvulsants and sedatives
* Dysfunction of cervical proprioception
* Side effects from other prescription drugs, such as proton-pump inhibitors or Coumadin (warfarin)

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Dizziness may occur from an abnormality involving the brain (in particular the brainstem or cerebellum), inner ear, eyes, heart, vascular system, fluid or blood volume, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or body electrolytes. Dizziness can accompany certain serious events, such as a concussion or brain bleed, epilepsy and seizures (convulsions), stroke, and cases of meningitis and encephalitis. However, the most common subcategories can be broken down as follows: 40% peripheral vestibular dysfunction, 10% central nervous system lesion, 15% psychiatric disorder, 25% presyncope/disequilibrium, and 10% nonspecific dizziness. Some vestibular pathologies have symptoms that are comorbid with mental disorders.

While traditional medical teaching has focused on determining the cause of dizziness based on the category (such as vertigo vs. presyncope), research published in 2017 suggests that this analysis is of limited clinical utility.

Medical conditions that often have dizziness as a symptom include:
* Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
* Ménière&#x27;s disease
* Labyrinthitis
* Otitis media
* Brain tumor
* Acoustic neuroma
* Motion sickness
* Ramsay Hunt syndrome
* Fatal Familial Insomnia
* Migraine
* Multiple sclerosis
* Pregnancy
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Low blood oxygen content (hypoxemia)
* Heart attack
* Iron deficiency (anemia)
* Vitamin B12 deficiency
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Hormonal changes (e.g. thyroid disease, menstruation, pregnancy)
* Panic disorder
* Hyperventilation
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Age-diminished visual, balance, and perception of spatial orientation abilities
* Stroke; cause of isolated dizziness in 0.7% of people who present to the emergency department

==Disequilibrium==

In medicine, disequilibrium refers to impaired equilibrioception that can be characterised as a sensation of impending fall or of the need to obtain external assistance for proper locomotion. It is sometimes described as a feeling of improper tilt of the floor, or as a sense of floating. This sensation can originate in the inner ear or other motion sensors, or in the central nervous system. Neurologic disorders tend to cause constant vertigo or disequilibrium and usually have other symptoms of neurologic dysfunction associated with the vertigo. Many medications used to treat seizures, depression, anxiety, and pain affect the vestibular system and the central nervous system which can cause the symptom of disequilibrium.

<doc id="697211" wikidata="Q952362" url="?curid=697211" title="Ensoniq">
<text>Ensoniq Corp. was an American electronics manufacturer, best known throughout the mid-1980s and 1990s for its musical instruments, principally samplers and synthesizers.

== History ==
In spring 1983, former MOS Technology engineers Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Yannes, Bruce Crockett, Charles Winterble, David Ziembicki, and Albert Charpentier formed Peripheral Visions. The team had designed the Commodore 64, and hoped to build another computer. To raise funds, Peripheral Visions agreed to build a computer keyboard for the Atari 2600, but the video game crash of 1983 canceled the project and Commodore sued the new company, claiming that it owned the keyboard project. Renaming itself as Ensoniq, the new company instead designed a music synthesizer.

Ensoniq grew rapidly over the next few years with the success of the Mirage and the ESQ-1. The plant in Great Valley, Pennsylvania employed nearly 200 people and housed the manufacturing facility. A number of successful products followed which all included the full-custom ICs for music and effects which were developed in house. While the core keyboard products were generally successful, there were some quality problems and increasing competition from Asian companies. An attempt to diversify into hearing aids was unsuccessful and put the company in financial peril. In the mid-nineties, they developed a line of very cost-effective sound cards which sold millions of units.
In January 1998, ENSONIQ Corp. was acquired by Creative Technology Ltd. for $77 million. The acquisition was focused on the sound-card technology of the Ensoniq Audio-PCI. The musical products division, which was in financial trouble, was merged with E-mu Systems to form the E-Mu/Ensoniq division of Creative. Over the next three years the Ensoniq operation in Pennsylvania was gradually dismantled and shut down. After releasing an entry-level E-mu MK6/PK6 and Ensoniq Halo keyboards in 2002 – essentially keyboard versions of the Proteus 2500 module – the E-Mu/Ensoniq division was dissolved and support for legacy products was discontinued soon afterward.

== Musical instruments and digital systems ==

Ensoniq entered the instrument market with the Mirage sampling keyboard in 1985. At the price of USD$1695 it cost significantly less than previous samplers such as the Fairlight CMI and the E-MU Emulator. Starting with the ESQ-1, they began producing sample-based synthesizers. Following the success of these products, Ensoniq established a subsidiary in Japan in 1987.

Ensoniq products were highly professional. Strong selling points were ease-of-use and their characteristic &quot;fat&quot;, rich sound (generally thought of as being an &quot;American&quot; quality, as opposed to the &quot;Japanese&quot; sound which was more &quot;digital&quot; and somewhat &quot;cold&quot;). After the Mirage, all Ensoniq instruments featured integrated sequencers (even their late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s samplers) providing an all-in-one &quot;digital studio production concept&quot; instrument. These were often called &quot;Music Workstations&quot;. Starting with the VFX synthesizer, high-quality effects units were included, in addition most synthesizer and all sampler models featured disk drives and/or RAM cards for storage. The manuals and tutorial documents were clearly written and highly musician-oriented, allowing the users to quickly get satisfactory results from their machines. In 1988, the company enlisted the Dixie Dregs in a limited edition promotional CD &quot;Off the Record&quot; which featured the band using the EPS sampler and SQ-80 cross wave synthesizer.

The company had much success with the SQ product line starting in the early 1990s. This was a lower-cost line that included the SQ-1 (61 keys), SQ-2 (76 keys) and SQ-R (rack-mounted, with no keys or sequencer), as well as KS-32 with full 76-keys weighted piano-keyboard. Later versions were produced with 32 sound-generating voices.

The company&#x27;s heyday was in the early 1990s when the VFX synthesizers offered innovative performance and sequencing features (and terrific acoustic sounds), along with the ASR series of 16-bit samplers which also integrated synthesis, effects, and sequencer into a single-unit digital studio. The TS synthesizers followed the legacy of the VFX line, improving several aspects such as the polyphony, effects engine, sample-loading capabilities and even better synth and acoustic sounds. The DP series of effects rack-mount units offered parallel processing and reverb presets on a par with Lexicon&#x27;s offerings, but at affordable prices.

Despite these strengths, early (1980s) Ensoniq instruments suffered from reliability and quality problems such as bad keyboards (Mirage DSK-8), under-developed power-supply units (early ESQ-1), or mechanical issues (EPS polypressure keyboard). Through the early and mid-1990s, much effort was focused on improving the reliability of the products. The company did not manage to reinvent its workstation concept in order to survive the mid and late &#x27;90s.

== Sound cards and semiconductors ==
In 1986, after making an agreement with Apple Computer, the same ES5503 DOC (Digital Oscillator Chip, marketed as &quot;Q-Chip&quot;) used in the Mirage sampler (DSK-8, DSK-1, DMS-1), ESQ-1, ESQ-M and SQ-80 synthesizers, and SDP-1 piano module, was incorporated into the Apple II personal computer.

Later engines, with 16-bit sample playback and internal digital filters, were ES5504 DOC-II (used in the EPS sampler) and ES5505 OTIS (used in the EPS16+ sampler and the VFX line of synthesizers featuring 21 voices). Finally, ES5506 OTTO drove all subsequent 32-voice machines (SD-1/32, TS10/12, ASR-10/88) and the dual-OTTO machines (KT, MR, ZR). The latest incarnation, ES5548 OTTO-48, was used in the final line of Ensoniq studio products (ASR-X, FIZMO).

Ensoniq also developed an effects DSP, ES5510 ESP, that was used in the machines from VFX on and the standalone FX units DP/2 and DP/4. OTTO-48 generation uses its greatly enhanced successor, ES5511 ESP V2. A combination of OTTO and ESP, ES5540 OTTOFX, was also developed and sold.

The Ensoniq ES5505 OTIS/OTISR2, and ES5510 ESP (Ensoniq Signal Processor) were also used in various arcade games. They were all manufactured on the CMOS process. OTTO was licensed to Advanced Gravis for use in the Gravis Ultrasound card. In 1994, production began on PC sound cards for home computers. The design of the video-game console Atari Panther also included the OTIS chip, though the product never reached series production. A dedicated version of OTTO, ES5530/35 OPUS, was developed for AT-bus sound cards, featuring built-in joystick and CD-ROM interface.

Ensoniq&#x27;s sound cards were popular and shipped with many IBM PC compatibles. Many games in the late MS-DOS era supported the Ensoniq Soundscape either directly or through General MIDI. In addition, Ensoniq devised an ISA software audio emulation solution for their new PCI sound cards that was compatible with most contemporary IBM PC games. It is speculated that this was an important factor in Creative Lab&#x27;s acquisition of Ensoniq, because Creative/E-MU was struggling with legacy compatibility at the time with their higher-performance PCI audio solutions.

=== Soundscape ===
* Ensoniq Soundscape S-2000 The original Soundscape was Ensoniq&#x27;s first direct foray into the PC sound card market. It was a full-length ISA digital audio and &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sample-based synthesis audio card, equipped with a 2 MB Ensoniq-built ROM-based patch set.
* Ensoniq SoundscapeDB The SSDB was a &#x27;wavetable&#x27; daughterboard (sample-based synthesis daughterboard) upgrade for PCs with a sound card bearing a Wave Blaster-compatible connector. It was based upon the S-2000 chipset but was without the digital sound effects section or any DAC. The SSDB would use the host sound card for final output.
* Ensoniq Soundscape Elite was Ensoniq&#x27;s high-end ISA offering. It offered the highest MIDI quality of any PC sound card they ever made, including the newer AudioPCI. The Elite was based mostly around the S-2000, with some additional features that set it far apart from its progenitor.
* Ensoniq Soundscape OPUS This card was a Gateway 2000 OEM, and possibly was used by other OEMs, but was never sold to Ensoniq&#x27;s customers directly. It was a Soundscape-like board, using the Ensoniq 5530/5535 OPUS multimedia sound chip, a chip that was only used on these OEM boards and essentially comprises an OTTO with back-then usual additional interfacing (Joystick, CD-ROM).
* Ensoniq Soundscape VIVO90 was Ensoniq&#x27;s generational step forward from the Ensoniq Soundscape S-2000-based boards. It was first produced in 1996. VIVO90 had similar specifications to the older boards, but was built to cost less to manufacture.
=== AudioPCI ===

* Ensoniq AudioPCI The AudioPCI was designed to be a low-cost, yet feature-rich audio solution, which could be integrated on computer motherboards as a value-added option. It consisted of little more than a small, host CPU driven audio chip (one of the following: S5016, ES1370, ES1371) and a companion DAC. Despite its small size and low cost, AudioPCI still offers nearly all of the audio capabilities and functionality of the Soundscape ELITE card. The AudioPCI line used an NMI-based emulation terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program Ensoniq developed to provide a reasonable level of legacy DOS compatibility without requiring any signals from the ISA bus, though the TSR could cause problems with games that relied on custom flavors of protected mode.

<text>Banco Popular Español, S.A. () was the sixth largest banking group in Spain before it was bought by Banco Santander as part of a rescue package in June 2017.

==Components==
The group consisted of the following companies: 
* national bank: Banco Popular Español
* regional bank: Banco Pastor 
* mortgage bank: Banco Popular Hipotecario
* private bank: Popular Banca Privada 
* French subsidiary: Banco Popular France (sold to Crédit Mutuel in 2008) 
* Portuguese subsidiary: Banco Popular Portugal 
* USA subsidiary: TotalBank (now part of City National Bank of Florida) 
* Internet bank: WiZink
* estate services subsidiary: Aliseda 

The bank had international offices in Belgium, Chile, Germany, Hong Kong, Morocco, Netherlands, Switzerland (Geneva and Zürich), London, the United States, France, Italy, and Venezuela.

==History==
Banco Popular Español (BPE) was founded in 1926.
In 1968, BPE opened a representative office in Paris that became a subsidiary that by 1991 had a network of 14 branches in France.
In 1992 BPE converted its subsidiary in France into a joint venture with Banco Comercial Português under the name Banco Popular Comercial.
BPE established a network of branches in Portugal in 2000.

In 2002 BPE and Banco Comercial Português parted ways; Banco Popular Comercial becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Popular and changed its name to Banco Popular France. 

In Portugal, Banco Popular bought Banco Nacional de Crédito (BNC) and transferred its existing branches there to BNC. Later, in 2005, BNC changed its name to Banco Popular Portugal.

In 2007 BPE bought a small bank in Southern Florida (United States of America) called TotalBank for US$300 million. The bank has 20 branches in Miami Dade County and more than 400 employees.

On 7 August 2009, Banco Popular Español acquired Banco de Andalucía, which was founded as Jerez de la Frontera in 1844 and had many services in the province of Cádiz, in the territorial area of Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Cádiz until 1959 when it expanded into the provinces of Seville and Huelva and changed its name to Banco de Andalucía. Spanish prosecutor José &quot;Pepe&quot; Grinda González believed Gennady Petrov () and his associates and entities related to them had bank accounts with Banco de Andalucía.

In 2017 SRM put Banco Popular under resolution process. All existing stocks and additional Tier 1 instruments were written down. Tier 2 instruments were converted into stocks and then sold to Banco Santander S.A. for €1. On August 8, 2017, it was announced that Banco Santander would sell its portion of Banco Popular&#x27;s real estate business to the New York City-based private equity corporation Blackstone Group.

<doc id="697225" wikidata="Q7782137" url="?curid=697225" title="Theodorick Bland (judge)">
<text>Theodorick Bland (December 6, 1776 – November 16, 1846) was a Maryland attorney, statesman, a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and Chancellor of Maryland.

==Education and early career==

Born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, Bland was admitted to the bar in 1797. He was in private practice of law in Danville Virginia, then in Tennessee and Kentucky, and finally in Baltimore, Maryland. Around 1800, he settled in Baltimore after reportedly after &quot;becoming dissatisfied with life on the frontier&quot;. He was elected a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1809 where he helped to write a new criminal code for the state. He was secretary of the Committee of Public Safety for Baltimore, beginning in 1812. On October 10, 1812, Bland was appointed to succeed Thomas Jones an associate judge for the 6th Judicial District of Maryland, which included Baltimore and Harford Counties, and served in that capacity until 1817. During the War of 1812, he was Secretary of the city&#x27;s Committee of Safety, and was active in defense of the city at the time of British invasion.

==South American Commission service==

Along with Caesar Augustus Rodney and John Graham, Bland was selected by President James Monroe in November 1817 for a special diplomatic mission to South America, the South American Commission of 1817–1818. He was endorsed for the slot by the secretary to the commission, Henry Marie Brackenridge. Bland suggested to Monroe that at least part of the Commission be authorized to visit Chile and authorization for this was given by United States Secretary of State John Quincy Adams two-weeks before setting sail. Under the command of Commodore Arthur Sinclair, the sailed on December 4, 1817, and arrived at Rio de Janeiro on January 29, 1818. In Montevideo, Bland introduced botanist William Baldwin, who accompanied the commission as the ship&#x27;s surgeon, to exiled Chilean general José Miguel Carrera. In April, Bland left Buenos Aires and went overland to Mendoza, Argentina then across the Uspallata Pass to Santiago, Chile. Meanwhile, the rest of the group departed the Isla Margarita on June 25, 1818, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia on July 8. A week later, Bland left Valparaíso and arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 29, 1818. The findings of the commissioners differed widely so much that they offered independent statements rather than one joint statement. Regarding the Government of Buenos Ayres, Secretary of State Adams summarized in his memoirs that &quot;Bland holds them in abhorrence and contempt&quot;. Unlike the reports of the others who commented nearly only on political, military, and commercial matters, Bland&#x27;s were longer and provided more discussion on geography and agriculture. He was impressed by the agricultural possibilities of Chile. The protagonists of the South American trip were all given &quot;positions of trust&quot; after their return.

==Federal judicial service==

Despite rumors of privateering, Bland received a recess appointment from President Monroe to a seat to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland vacated by Judge James Houston, on November 23, 1819. Formally nominated on January 3, 1820, Bland was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 5, 1820, and received his commission the same day. Bland served for four years, and resigned on August 16, 1824, to be appointed Chancellor of Maryland.

==Chancellor of Maryland==

Bland said:

Shortly after his appointment, a ruling by Bland displeased a party to the suit, who persuaded the Maryland House of Delegates to attempt to abolish the office of Chancellor, and failing that, to eliminate the salary for the position. The Maryland Senate rejected initial efforts to reduce the Chancellor&#x27;s salary from $3,400 to $2,200 or $2,500, but eventually passed a House bill that made no provision for the salary, in order to avoid a fiscal crisis. In the next session of the legislature, Bland presented a memorandum arguing that the actions of the legislature threatened the independence of the judiciary. This appeal succeeded, and the legislature thereafter passed a bill to permanently fix the salary of the Chancellor at the sum of $3,400, and to pay Bland in arrears at that rate.

His opinions tended to be lengthy and to summarize substantial amounts of doctrine. An example is his opinion in &quot;Gwinn vs. Payson&quot;, written while he was sitting as Judge of the Baltimore County Court. The case involved a fairly simple bill in equity to have a certain deed set aside, and the property mentioned therein sold to satisfy a mortgage held by the complainants. Bland doubted his jurisdiction over the matter due to his uncertainty as to the constitutionality of the act clothing his court with chancery powers. He delivered a 94-page opinion, including 65 pages addressing the power of the judicial branch of the government to annul a law enacted by the legislative branch on the ground if its being in conflict with the Constitution of the State. Bland found that the legislature had exceeded its power in granting original equity jurisdiction to the court, but also noted that the parties had expressed their wish to have the matter resolved by the court, and therefore granted a consent decree.

==Death==

Described as a &quot;gentleman of the old school&quot;, Bland died in his bed from &quot;a disease of the heart&quot; in Annapolis, Maryland on November 16, 1846. He was buried at Cemetery Creek (now St. Anne&#x27;s Cemetery) in Annapolis. He was memorialized at a meeting of the Bar of Baltimore, by a committee chaired by United States Chief Justice Roger B. Taney and including William Henry Norris, with addresses delivered by distinguished members including Charles F. Mayer and Reverdy Johnson. It has been noted with some irony that Bland&#x27;s will was the subject of litigation in &quot;Mayo vs. Bland&quot;, 4 Md. Chancery, 484.

==Family==

Chancellor Bland was a descendant of Governor Richard Bennett and Bennett&#x27;s son-in-law, Theodorick Bland of Westover. He was the son of Theodorick Bland (born 1746) and Sarah Fitzhugh (1748–1793). Bland&#x27;s uncle was Thomas Fitzhugh and his sister was Sophia Bland. Bland married Sarah Glen (born 1770), the widow of John Davis. Bland&#x27;s two step-children by this marriage were:
* Elizabeth Glen Davies married John Stuart Skinner on March 10, 1812.
* Jacob G. Davies
The marriage of Bland to Sarah Glen produced at least two children:
* Sarah Battaile Fitzhugh Bland married Captain Isaac Mayo in 1835. Their daughter, Sarah Battaile Mayo, resided in the Peggy Stewart House in Annapolis and married Thomas Henry Gaither in 1857.
* William G. Bland

John Hesselius painted a portrait of Bland&#x27;s mother, Sarah Fitzhugh Bland, in 1767. It is the only signed work by Hesselius for which there is a record of the value of the commission: £20 and sixteen shillings. The Maryland Historical Society eventually received the portrait from Chancellor Bland&#x27;s great-grandsons in 1945.

Theodorick Bland was cousin to Lucy Fitzhugh, the mother of George Fitzhugh. Their common grandfather was Colonel Henry Fitzhugh (1723-1783), the father of Sarah Fitzhugh Bland, who likewise commissioned a portrait by John Hesselius in 1751.

Between 1828 and 1845, Bland purchased a 300-acre farm owned by John Crompton Weems and known as &quot;LaGrange&quot;; under his ownership, the property became known as &quot;Blandair&quot;. Sarah Bland Mayo inherited the property upon her father&#x27;s death and eventually gave the property to her daughter, Sarah Mayo Gaither, as a wedding present in 1857.

<text>A  is an organisation of humans traditionally present in Sámi societies consisting of several families of reindeer herders whose reindeer graze together. s traditionally encompassed more resources than reindeer, but after changes in Sámi societies over the course of the 1600s, only reindeer herders still practiced this system. It is termed a (&#x27;Sámi village&#x27;) in Swedish law, (&#x27;reindeer pasture district&#x27;) in Norwegian law, and (&#x27;reindeer herding district&#x27;) in Finnish law. The pastoralist organisation differs slightly between countries, except in Russia, where kolkhoz replaced these earlier organisations.

==Sweden==

In Sweden, membership in a follows &quot;pastoralist rights&quot; based on statute of limitations, and is limited to individuals of Sámi descent. These rights also include hunting and fishing for profit. There are thirty-three mountain s, ten forest s and eight concession s, divided by historical extent, summer and winter pasture usage, etc. Membership is required to practice pastoralist rights. This is required for reindeer ownership as well, except in concession s, where even non-members can own &quot;serve reindeers&quot;, served by members who receiving concession to pasture lands in payment. This custom originates in older conventions when reindeer were used by settled local populations in daily life. The economic activity in present-day s is limited to profit from pastoralist rights. In addition to the geographical and economic nature of the , it also ties the members together culturally and socially.

Based on historic Swedification policies that distinguished between settled and nomadic Sámi, membership in Swedish s is essentially limited to those whose ancestors were nomads before 1886, barring the majority of Swedish Sámi from membership in a .

=== Swedish sameby ===
Mountain Sámi villages: Könkämä, Lainiovuoma, Saarivuoma, Talma, Gabna, Leavas, Girjas, Báste, Unna Tjerusj, Sirges, Jåkkåkaskatjiellde, Tuorpon, Luokta Mavas, Semisjaur-Njarg, Svaipa, Grans, Rans, Ubmeje tjeälddie, Vapstens, Vilhelmina norra, Vilhelmina södra, Frostvikens norra, Ohredahke, Raedtievaerie, Jiingevaerie, Jovnevaerie, Njaarke, Kall, Handölsdalens, Tåssåsens, Mittådalens, Ruvhten Sijte, and Idre

Concession Sámi villages: Muonio, Sattajärvi, Tärendö, Korju, Pirttijärvi, Ängeså, Kalix, and Liehittäjä

==Norway==
In Norway, pastoralist activity requires membership in a unit (), corresponding to a reindeer herd. The rights to conduct pastoralism are based on statute of limitations and limited to individuals of Sámi descent.

The 2007 Reindeer Husbandry Act revised the official reindeer district system to acknowledge and incorporate traditional units, improving recognition of Sámi land rights and centering reindeer grazing activities on ecologically and economically sustainable resource use based on local culture and tradition. Prior to the act, Norwegian authorities maintained their own definitions of reindeer herding districts, leading to piecemeal development and sales of land, disconnecting traditional pasture areas. 

==Finland and Russia==
In Finland and Russia, pastoralist activity is not limited to ethnic Sámi. In Finland, reindeer herding is also practiced by non-Sámi Finns. There are 56 s, of which 13 in the extreme north of Lapland constitute the Sámi area. However, reindeer herding has a more prominent economic role in the local communities of the north. s are governed like stock companies, where the reindeer-holders elect a board of directors and a chief executive officer (, &#x27;reindeer master&#x27;) every three years, voting with as many votes as they have reindeer.

In Russia, Arctic peoples were forcibly relocated to &quot;kolchoz&quot;es (collective communities) by the state between 1927 and 1940, including the Sámi of the Kola Peninsula. The Sámi were moved to &quot;kolchozes&quot; in the &quot;pogost&quot;s of Kamensky, Iokangsky, Kildinsky, Lovozersky, and Voronensk, and eventually two &quot;raion&quot; (administrative district) in Murmansk Oblast were designated as Sámi districts, Lovozersky District and Saamsky District.

<text>Chemical Markup Language (ChemML or CML) is an approach to managing molecular information using tools such as XML and Java. It was the first domain specific implementation based strictly on XML, first based on a DTD and later on an XML Schema, the most robust and widely used system for precise information management in many areas. It has been developed over more than a decade by Murray-Rust, Rzepa and others and has been tested in many areas and on a variety of machines.

Chemical information is traditionally stored in many different file types which inhibit reuse of the documents. CML uses XML&#x27;s portability to help CML developers and chemists design interoperable documents. There are a number of tools that can generate, process and view CML documents. Publishers can distribute chemistry within XML documents by using CML, e.g. in RSS documents.

CML is capable of supporting a wide range of chemical concepts including:
* molecules
* reactions
* spectra and analytical data
* computational chemistry
* chemical crystallography and materials

Details of CML and points currently under discussion are now posted on the CML Blog.

== Versioning ==
Versions of the schema are available at SourceForge. As of April 2012, the latest frozen schema is CML v2.4. Some constructs in CML v1 are now deprecated.

== Tools ==
JUMBO began life as the Java Universal Molecular Browser for Objects but is now a Java library that supports validation, reading and writing of CML as well as conversion of several legacy formats to CML and, for example, a reaction in CML to an animated SVG representation of the reaction. JUMBO has evolved into an extensive Java library, CMLDOM, supporting all elements in the schema. Although JUMBO used to be a browser, the preferred approach is to use the Open Source tools Jmol and JChemPaint, some of which use alternative CML libraries. See Blue Obelisk.

<text>Merchandising is any practice which contributes to the sale of products (&quot;merch&quot; colloquially) to a retail consumer. At a retail in-store level, merchandising refers to displaying products that are for sale in a creative way that entices customers to purchase more items or products.

In retail commerce, visual display merchandising means merchandise sales using product design, selection, packaging, pricing, and display that stimulates consumers to spend more. This includes disciplines and discounting, physical presentation of products and displays, and the decisions about which products should be presented to which customers at what time. Often in a retail setting, creatively tying in related products or accessories is a great way to entice consumers to purchase more.

Merchandising helps to understand the ordinary dating notation for the terms of payment of an invoice. Codified discounting solves pricing problems including markups and markdowns. It helps to find the net price of an item after single or multiple trade discounts and can calculate a single discount rate that is equivalent to a series of multiple discounts. Further, it helps to calculate the amount of cash discount for which a payment qualifies.

==Promotional merchandising==


The annual cycle of merchandising differs between countries and even within them, particularly relating to cultural customs like holidays, and seasonal issues like climate and local sporting and recreation. Events such as Chinese festivals and Japanese festivals are incorporated in an annual cycle of shop decorations and merchandise promotion.
As just one example, in the United States the basic retail cycle begins in early January with merchandise for Valentine&#x27;s Day, which is not until mid-February. Presidents&#x27; Day sales are held shortly thereafter. Following this, Easter is the major holiday, while springtime clothing and garden-related merchandise is already arriving at stores, often as early as mid-winter (toward the beginning of this section, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day merchandise, including green items and products pertaining to Irish culture, is also promoted). Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day are next, with graduation gifts (typically small consumer electronics like digital cameras) often being marketed as &quot;dads and grads&quot; in June (though most college semesters end in May; the grads portion usually refers to high school graduation, which occurs one to two weeks after Father&#x27;s Day in many U.S. states). Summer merchandise is next, including patriotic-themed products with the American flag, placed on the market by Memorial Day in preparation for Independence Day (with Flag Day in between). By July, back-to-school is on the shelves and autumn merchandise is already arriving, and at some arts and crafts stores, Christmas decorations. (Often, a Christmas in July celebration is held around this time.) The back-to-school market is promoted heavily in August, when there are no holidays to promote. By September, particularly after Labor Day, summer merchandise is on final closeout and overstock of school supplies is marked-down some as well, and Halloween (and often even more of the Christmas) merchandise is appearing. As the Halloween decorations and costumes dwindle in October, Christmas is already being pushed on consumers, and by the day after Halloween retailers are going full-force with advertising, even though the &quot;official&quot; season does not start until the day after Thanksgiving. Christmas clearance sales begin even before Christmas at many retailers, though others begin on the day after Christmas and continue on at least until New Year&#x27;s Day but sometimes as far out as February.

The trend of stocking stores with merchandise many weeks prior to the actual event targeted and the period of consumption can be described by the term advance selling. Although it may seem disadvantageous for sellers, advance selling can have the opposite effect. For example, this practice works to counteract a lack of abundant capacity in stores during prime seasons and a lack of value in premature products.

Merchandising also varies within retail chains, where stores in places like Buffalo might carry snow blowers, while stores in Florida and southern California might instead carry beach clothing and barbecue grills all year. Coastal-area stores might carry water skiing equipment, while ones near mountain ranges would likely have snow skiing and snowboarding gear if there are ski areas nearby.

=== Silent persuasion ===
As promotional merchandise acquires a larger portion of companies&#x27; annual budgets, its appearance in the hands of unintended recipients increases. However, this has been found to generate a positive outcome for companies without any additional effort after producing the merchandise because of the concept of silent persuasion. The concept theorizes that even without the acknowledgement of the brand being promoted on the merchandise, the individual utilizing it is affected in their future actions as a consumer. Furthermore, a 2019 study found that the tactile usage of the products produced a greater response in consumers than a solely visual interaction with a product such as posters. This study concluded that considering allotting a greater sum of money to smaller pieces of merchandising that promote a brand would benefit newer companies that have yet to become quickly recognizable.

==Retail supply chain==

In the supply chain, merchandising is the practice of making products in retail outlets available to consumers, primarily by stocking shelves and displays. While this used to be done exclusively by the stores&#x27; employees, many retailers have found substantial savings in requiring it to be done by the manufacturer, vendor, or wholesaler that provides the products to the retail store. In the United Kingdom, there are a number of organizations that supply merchandising services to support retail outlets with general stock replenishment and merchandising support in new stores. By doing this, retail stores have been able to substantially reduce the number of employees needed to run the store.

While stocking shelves and building displays is often done when the product is delivered, it is increasingly a separate activity from delivering the product. In grocery stores, for example, almost all products delivered directly to the store from a manufacturer or wholesaler will be stocked by the manufacturer&#x27;s/wholesaler&#x27;s employee who is a full-time merchandiser. Product categories where this is common are Beverage (all types, alcoholic and non-alcoholic), packaged baked goods (bread and pastries), magazines and books, and health and beauty products. 
For major food manufacturers in the beverage and baked goods industries, their merchandisers are often the single largest employee group within the company. For nationwide branded goods manufacturers such as The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, their respective merchandiser work forces number in the thousands.

== Channel merchandising ==
This concept can be linked to marketing channels which bring products from the possession of the producer into the possession of the consumer. In recent decades, these methods utilized by companies to provide merchandise have expanded from in-person only, to online-only for some stores during the COVID-19 pandemic, to a mixture of both, sometimes referred to as omnichannel retailing. The combination of both options for consumers provides a favorable encounter with retailers that makes them more likely to purchase products and return to the seller again at a future date. However, these strategies can be difficult for sellers to maintain as it can require many more physical and technical resources that may not be currently available to them.

=== Online merchandising ===
A challenge that online retailers face in comparison to the traditional in-store shopping experience is the sensory exploration that isn&#x27;t available to consumers through a screen. An area this is especially prevalent in is clothing or fashion retail in which potential sizing issues can be a large factor in a customer refraining from purchasing an item online. Moreover, accurately portraying the texture and quality of a product in all areas of retail, not limited to fashion, remains a challenge in the field of online merchandising as the lack thereof has been proven to result in more indecision for consumers. Because of this, many companies look for ways to improve their online shopping options to make browsing merchandise as similar to an in-store experience as possible while keeping up with the growing online market.

==Licensing==

In marketing, one of the definitions of merchandising is the practice in which the brand or image from one product or service is used to sell another. Trademarked brand names, logos, or character images are licensed to manufacturers of products such as toys or clothing, which then make items in or emblazoned with the image of the license, hoping they&#x27;ll sell better than the same item with no such image. For the owners of the IP (intellectual property) in question, merchandising is a very popular source of revenue, due to the low cost of letting a third party manufacture the merchandise, while the IP owners collect the merchandising (royalty) fees.

In 1903, a year after publishing &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, English author Beatrix Potter created the first Peter Rabbit soft toy and registered him at the Patent Office in London, making Peter the oldest licensed fictional character. Erica Wagner of &quot;The Times&quot; states, &quot;Beatrix Potter was the first to recognise that content—as we now call the stuff that makes up a book or a film—was only the beginning. In 1903, Peter hopped outside his pages to become a patented soft toy, which gave him the distinction of being not only Mr. McGregor‘s mortal enemy, but also becoming the first licensed character&quot;.

==Children==

Merchandising for children is most prominently seen in connection with films and videogames, usually those in current release and with television shows oriented towards children.

Merchandising, especially in connection with child-oriented films, TV shows and literature, often consists of toys made in the likeness of the show or book&#x27;s characters (action figures) or items which they use. This was first seen with the Peter Rabbit soft toy in 1903, with the &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine stating Beatrix Potter &quot;created a system that continues to benefit all licensed characters, from Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter.&quot; However, sometimes it can be the other way around, with the show written to include the toys, as advertising for the merchandise.

Sometimes merchandising from a television show can grow far beyond the original show, even lasting decades after the show has largely disappeared from popularity. In other cases, large amounts of merchandise can be generated from a pitifully small amount of source material (Mashimaro).

==Adult==
The most common adult-oriented merchandising is that related to professional sports teams (and their players).

A smaller niche in merchandising is the marketing of more adult-oriented products in connection with similarly adult-oriented films and TV shows. This is common especially with the science fiction and horror genres. Occasionally, shows which were intended more for children find a following among adults (for example, &quot;Gundam&quot; model kits). An early example of this phenomenon was the cartoon character Little Lulu, who became licensed to products for adults, such as Kleenex facial tissue.

Sometimes a brand of non-media products can achieve enough recognition and respect that simply putting its name or images on a completely unrelated item can sell that item. An example is Harley-Davidson branded clothing.

===Idol goods===

Idol goods or idol merchandise are various types of merchandise related to celebrities (&quot;idols&quot;). Consumption of idol goods is a significant part of the idol fandom. Such goods create and reinforce a more physical connection between fans and celebrities.

Examples of common idol goods include stationery items, compact discs, photo albums, calendars, telephone cards, T-shirts (see also concert T-shirt), key chains, lapel pins, and various other goods. Virtual idols can be considered an idol good themselves as they can be bought and sold. An idol can have a tremendous effect on sales of merchandise, an example being David Beckham upon his arrival at Real Madrid in 2003, with an Adidas spokesman stating, &quot;Put Beckham&#x27;s name on any product and Real Madrid didn&#x27;t stop selling&quot;.

In the 1960s the Beatles were pioneers in conventional retailing in music, setting up their own retail store in London, Apple Boutique, that sold Beatles merchandise.

<text>Sir Niall Campbell Ferguson, ( ; born 18 April 1964) is a British-American historian who is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Previously, he was a professor at Harvard University, the London School of Economics, New York University, a visiting professor at the New College of the Humanities, and a senior research fellow at Jesus College, Oxford. He was a visiting lecturer at the London School of Economics for the 2023/2024 academic year and at Tsinghua University in China from 2019 to 2020. He is a co-founder of the University of Austin. 

Ferguson writes and lectures on international history, economic history, financial history, and the history of the British Empire and American imperialism. He holds positive views concerning the British Empire. In 2004, he was one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world. Ferguson has written and presented numerous television documentary series, including &quot;The Ascent of Money&quot;, which won an International Emmy Award for Best Documentary in 2009. In 2024, he was knighted by King Charles III for services to literature.

Ferguson has been a contributing editor for Bloomberg Television and a columnist for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. He began writing a semi-monthly column for &quot;Bloomberg Opinion&quot; in June 2020 and has also been a regular columnist at &quot;The Spectator&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot; In 2021, he became a joint-founder of the new University of Austin. Since June 2024, he is a bi-weekly columnist at &quot;The Free Press.&quot; Ferguson has also contributed articles to many journals including &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy.&quot; He has been described as a conservative and called himself a supporter of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

==Early life and education==
Ferguson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 18 April 1964 to James Campbell Ferguson, a doctor, and Molly Archibald Hamilton, a physics teacher. Ferguson grew up in the Ibrox area of Glasgow in a home close to the Ibrox Park football stadium. He attended The Glasgow Academy. He was brought up as an atheist, although he has encouraged his children to study religion and attends church occasionally. In a 2023 interview with Jordan Peterson, Ferguson declared: &quot;I&#x27;m a lapsed atheist ... I go to church every Sunday, precisely because having been brought up as an atheist, I came to realise in my career as a historian that not only is atheism a disastrous basis for a society ... but also because I don&#x27;t think it can be a basis for individual ethical decision making.&quot;

Ferguson cites his father as instilling in him a strong sense of self-discipline and of the moral value of work, while his mother encouraged his creative side. His maternal grandfather, a journalist, encouraged him to write. He has described his parents as &quot;both very much products of the Scottish Enlightenment&quot;. Ferguson ascribes his decision to read history at university instead of English literature to two main factors: Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s reflections on history at the end of &quot;War and Peace&quot;, which he read as a schoolboy, and his admiration of historian A. J. P. Taylor, with Max Hastings quoting Ferguson as saying that he &quot;wanted to be the AJP Taylor de nos jours&quot;.

===Oxford===
Ferguson received a demyship (highest scholarship) from Magdalen College, Oxford. While a student there, he wrote a 90-minute student film &quot;The Labours of Hercules Sprote&quot;, played double bass in a jazz band &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;, edited the student magazine &quot;Tributary&quot;, and befriended Andrew Sullivan, who shared his interest in right-wing politics and punk music. He had become a Thatcherite by 1982. In 1985, he graduated with a first-class honours degree in history and was awarded an MA from Oxford. Ferguson studied as a Hanseatic Scholar at the University of Hamburg from 1986 until 1988. He received his DPhil degree from the University of Oxford in 1989. His dissertation was titled &quot;Business and Politics in the German Inflation: Hamburg 1914–1924&quot;.

==Career==

===Academic career===
In 1989, Ferguson worked as a research fellow at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. From 1990 to 1992 he was an official fellow and lecturer at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He then became a fellow and tutor in modern history at Jesus College, Oxford, where in 2000 he was named a professor of political and financial history. In 2002 Ferguson became the John Herzog Professor in Financial History at New York University Stern School of Business, and in 2004 he became the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University and William Ziegler Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. From 2010 to 2011, Ferguson held the Philippe Roman Chair in history and international affairs at the London School of Economics. In 2016 Ferguson left Harvard to become a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, where he had been an adjunct fellow since 2005. In 2021 he joined Bari Weiss, the Shakespeare scholar Pano Kanelos and the entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale to found the University of Austin. At the time, Ferguson said he was starting the college because &quot;higher ed is broken.&quot; The private liberal arts college was approved to grant degrees in late 2023.

Ferguson has received honorary degrees from the University of Buckingham, Macquarie University (Australia) and Adolfo Ibáñez University (Chile). In May 2010, Michael Gove, education secretary, asked Ferguson to advise on the development of a new history syllabus, to be titled &quot;history as a connected narrative&quot;, for schools in England and Wales. In June 2011, he joined other academics to set up the New College of the Humanities, a private college in London. In the same year, emails were released to the public and university administrators which documented Ferguson&#x27;s attempts to discredit a progressive activist student at Stanford University who had been critical of Ferguson&#x27;s choices of speakers invited to the Cardinal Conversations free speech initiative. He teamed with a Republican Party student group to find information that might discredit the student. Ferguson resigned from leadership of the program once university administrators became aware of his actions.

Ferguson responded in his column saying, &quot;Re-reading my emails now, I am struck by their juvenile, jocular tone. &#x27;A famous victory&#x27;, I wrote the morning after the Murray event. &#x27;Now we turn to the more subtle game of grinding them down on the committee. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.&#x27; Then I added: &#x27;Some opposition research on Mr O might also be worthwhile&#x27;—a reference to the leader of the protests. None of this happened. The meetings of the student committee were repeatedly postponed. No one ever did any digging on &#x27;Mr O&#x27;. The spring vacation arrived. The only thing that came of the emails was that their circulation led to my stepping down.&quot;

===Business ===

In 2000, Ferguson was a founding director of Boxmind, an Oxford-based educational technology company. In 2006, he set up Chimerica Media Ltd., a London-based television production company. In 2007, Ferguson was appointed as an investment management consultant by GLG Partners, to advise on geopolitical risk as well as current structural issues in economic behaviour relating to investment decisions. GLG is a UK-based hedge fund management firm headed by Noam Gottesman.

===Politics===
Ferguson was an advisor to the John McCain 2008 presidential campaign and supported the Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign.

===Commentary, documentaries and broadcasting===

Ferguson has written regularly for British newspapers and magazines since the mid 1980s. At that time, he was lead writer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and a regular book reviewer for &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;. In the summer of 1989, while travelling in Berlin, he wrote an article for a British newspaper with the provisional headline &quot;The Berlin Wall is Crumbling&quot;, but it was not published. In the early 2000s he wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, leaving in 2007 to become a contributing editor to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Between 2008 and 2012, he wrote regularly for &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Since 2015, Ferguson has written a weekly column for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, which also appears in numerous papers around the world. Ferguson&#x27;s television series, &quot;The Ascent of Money&quot;, won the 2009 International Emmy award for Best Documentary. In 2011, his film company Chimerica Media released its first feature-length documentary, &quot;Kissinger&quot;, which won the New York Film Festival&#x27;s prize for Best Documentary. In an interview with Peter Robinson, Ferguson recounted the &quot;humiliation&quot; his wife, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, endured at being disinvited from giving the commencement address at Brandeis University in 2014. Observing this to being a recurring phenomena as &quot;a curious illiberal turn&quot; for universities, including Harvard where he was teaching, and that this made him a critic of cancel culture. &quot;Prospect&quot; has since described him as one of the most prominent supporters of anti cancel-culture. Ferguson has said &quot;Wokeism has gone from being a fringe fashion to be the dominant ideology of the universities.&quot;

====BBC Reith Lectures====
In May 2012, the BBC announced Niall Ferguson was to present its annual Reith Lectures. These four lectures, titled &quot;The Rule of Law and its Enemies&quot;, examine the role man-made institutions have played in the economic and political spheres. In the first lecture, held at the London School of Economics, titled &quot;The Human Hive&quot;, Ferguson argues for greater openness from governments, saying they should publish accounts which clearly state all assets and liabilities. He said that governments should also follow the lead of business and adopt the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and above all generational accounts should be prepared on a regular basis to make absolutely clear the inter-generational implications of current fiscal policy. In the lecture, Ferguson says young voters should be more supportive of government austerity measures if they do not wish to pay further down the line for the profligacy of the baby boomer generation.

In the second lecture, &quot;The Darwinian Economy&quot;, Ferguson reflects on the causes of the global financial crisis, and allegedly erroneous conclusions that many people have drawn from it about the role of regulation, and asks whether regulation is in fact &quot;the disease of which it purports to be the cure&quot;. &quot;The Landscape of Law&quot; was the third lecture, delivered at Gresham College. It examines the rule of law in comparative terms, asking how far the common law&#x27;s claims to superiority over other systems are credible, and whether we are living through a time of &quot;creeping legal degeneration&quot; in the English-speaking world. The fourth and final lecture, &quot;Civil and Uncivil Societies&quot;, focuses on institutions (outside the political, economic and legal realms) designed to preserve and transmit particular knowledge and values. Ferguson asks whether the modern state is quietly killing civil society in the Western world, and what non-Western societies can do to build a vibrant civil society. The first lecture was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service on Tuesday, 19 June 2012. The series is available as a BBC podcast.

===Books===

====&quot;The Cash Nexus&quot;====
In his 2001 book, &quot;The Cash Nexus&quot;, which he wrote following a year as Houblon-Norman Fellow at the Bank of England, Ferguson argues that the popular saying &quot;money makes the world go &#x27;round is wrong; instead he presented a case for human actions in history motivated by far more than just economic concerns.

====&quot;Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World&quot;====
In his 2003 book, &quot;Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World&quot;, Ferguson conducts a provocative reinterpretation of the British Empire, casting it as one of the world&#x27;s great modernising forces. The Empire produced durable changes and globalisation with steampower, telegraphs, and engineers. Bernard Porter, famous for expressing his views during the Porter–MacKenzie debate on the British Empire, attacked &quot;Empire&quot; in &quot;The London Review of Books&quot; as a &quot;panegyric to British colonialism&quot;. In response to this, Ferguson drew Porter&#x27;s attention to the conclusion of the book, where he writes: &quot;No one would claim that the record of the British Empire was unblemished. On the contrary, I have tried to show how often it failed to live up to its own ideal of individual liberty, particularly in the early era of enslavement, transportation and the &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27; of indigenous peoples.&quot; Despite this, Ferguson argues that the British Empire was still preferable to German and Japanese rule at the time:

The 19th-century empire undeniably pioneered free trade, free capital movements and, with the abolition of slavery, free labour. It invested immense sums in developing a global network of modern communications. It spread and enforced the rule of law over vast areas. Though it fought many small wars, the empire maintained a global peace unmatched before or since. In the 20th century too the empire more than justified its own existence. For the alternatives to British rule represented by the German and Japanese empires were clearly—and they admitted it themselves—far worse. And without its empire, it is inconceivable that Britain could have withstood them.

The book was the subject for a documentary series on British television network Channel 4.

====&quot;Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire&quot; ====
In his 2005 book, &quot;Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire&quot;, Ferguson proposes that the United States aspires to globalize free markets, the rule of law, and representative government but shies away from the long-term commitments of manpower and money that are indispensable in taking a more active role in resolving conflict arising from the failure of states. The United States is an empire in denial, not acknowledging the scale of global responsibilities. The American writer Michael Lind, responding to Ferguson&#x27;s advocation of an enlarged American military through conscription, accused Ferguson of engaging in apocalyptic alarmism about the possibility of a world without the United States as the dominant power and of a casual disregard for the value of human life.

====&quot;War of the World&quot;====

In &quot;War of the World&quot;, published in 2006, Ferguson argued that a combination of economic volatility, decaying empires, psychopathic dictators, racially/ethnically motivated and institutionalised violence resulted in the wars and genocides of what he calls &quot;History&#x27;s Age of Hatred&quot;. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; named &quot;War of the World&quot; one of the 100 Notable Books of the Year in 2006, while the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; called it &quot;one of the most intriguing attempts by an historian to explain man&#x27;s inhumanity to man&quot;. Ferguson addresses the paradox that, though the 20th century was &quot;so bloody&quot;, it was also &quot;a time of unparalleled [economic] progress&quot;. As with his earlier work &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;War of the World&quot; was accompanied by a Channel 4 television series presented by Ferguson.

====&quot;The Ascent of Money&quot;====
Published in 2008, &quot;The Ascent of Money&quot; examines the history of money, credit, and banking. In it, Ferguson predicts a financial crisis as a result of the world economy and in particular the United States using too much credit. He cites the China–United States dynamic which he refers to as Chimerica where an Asian &quot;savings glut&quot; helped create the subprime mortgage crisis with an influx of easy money.

====&quot;Civilization&quot;====
Published in 2011, &quot;Civilization: The West and the Rest&quot; examines what Ferguson calls the most &quot;interesting question&quot; of our day: &quot;Why, beginning around 1500, did a few small polities on the western end of the Eurasian landmass come to dominate the rest of the world?&quot; In the review of Ferguson&#x27;s book, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote:

In 1500 Europe&#x27;s future imperial powers controlled 10% of the world&#x27;s territories and generated just over 40% of its wealth. By 1913, at the height of empire, the West controlled almost 60% of the territories, which together generated almost 80% of the wealth. This stunning fact is lost, he regrets, on a generation that has supplanted history&#x27;s sweep with a feeble-minded relativism that holds &quot;all civilisations as somehow equal&quot;.

Ferguson attributes this divergence to the West&#x27;s development of six &quot;killer apps&quot;, which he finds were largely missing elsewhere in the world in 1500 – &quot;competition, the scientific method, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism and the Protestant work ethic&quot;. Ferguson compared and contrasted how the West&#x27;s &quot;killer apps&quot; allowed the West to triumph over &quot;the Rest&quot; citing examples. Ferguson argued the rowdy and savage competition between European merchants created far more wealth than did the static and ordered society of Qing China. Tolerance extended to thinkers like Sir Isaac Newton in Stuart England had no counterpart in the Ottoman Empire, where Takiyuddin&#x27;s state built observatory was eventually demolished due to political conflict. This ensured that Western civilization was capable of making scientific advances that Ottoman civilization never could. Respect for private property was far stronger in British America than it ever was in Spanish America, which led to Anglo-America (the United States and Canada) becoming prosperous societies while Latin America was and remains mired in poverty. Ferguson also argued that the modern West had lost its edge and the future belongs to the nations of Asia, especially China, which has adopted the West&#x27;s &quot;killer apps&quot;. Ferguson argues that in the coming years, we will see a steady decline of the West, while China and the rest of the Asian nations will be the rising powers. A related documentary &quot;&quot; was broadcast as a six-part series on Channel 4 in March and April 2011.

====&quot;Kissinger: 1923–1968: The Idealist&quot;====
&quot;Kissinger The Idealist&quot;, Volume I, published in September 2015, is the first part of a planned two-part biography of Henry Kissinger based on his private papers. The book starts with a quote from a letter which Kissinger wrote in 1972. The book examines Kissinger&#x27;s life from being a refugee and fleeing Nazi Germany in 1938, to serving in the United States Army as a &quot;free man&quot; in World War II, to studying at Harvard. The book explores the history of Kissinger joining the Kennedy administration and later becoming critical of its foreign policy, to supporting Nelson Rockefeller on three failed presidential bids, to joining the Nixon administration. The book includes Kissinger&#x27;s early evaluation of the Vietnam War and his efforts to negotiate with the North Vietnamese in Paris (Paris Peace Accords). Historians and political scientists gave the book mixed reviews.

In a review about &quot;The Idealist&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr Ferguson, a British historian also at Harvard, has in the past sometimes produced work that is rushed and uneven. Not here. Like Mr Kissinger or loathe him, this is a work of engrossing scholarship.&quot; In a negative review of &quot;The Idealist&quot;, the American journalist Michael O&#x27;Donnell questioned Ferguson&#x27;s interpretation of Kissinger&#x27;s actions leading up to Nixon&#x27;s election in 1968 as United States president. Andrew Roberts praised the book in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, concluding: &quot;Niall Ferguson already has many important, scholarly and controversial books to his credit. But if the second volume of &#x27;Kissinger&#x27; is anywhere near as comprehensive, well written and riveting as the first, this will be his masterpiece.&quot;

====&quot;The Square and the Tower&quot;====
In 2018&#x27;s &quot;The Square and the Tower&quot;, Ferguson proposed a modified version of group selection that history can be explained by the evolution of human networks. He wrote, &quot;Man, with his unrivaled neural network, was born &quot;to&quot; network.&quot; The title refers to a transition from hierarchical &quot;tower&quot; networks to flatter &quot;square&quot; network connections between individuals. In a review of the book, John Gray was not convinced. He wrote, &quot;[Ferguson] offers a mix of metaphor and what purports to be a new science.&quot; In &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Deirdre McCloskey wrote: &quot;Niall Ferguson has again written a brilliant book, this time in defence of traditional top-down principles of governing the wild market and the wilder international order. &quot;The Square and the Tower&quot; raises the question of just how much the unruly world should be governedand by whom. Not everyone will agree, but everyone will be charmed and educated. ... &quot;The Square and the Tower&quot; is always readable, intelligent, original. You can swallow a chapter a night before sleep and your dreams will overflow with scenes of Stendhal&#x27;s &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;, Napoleon, Kissinger. In 400 pages you will have restocked your mind. Do it.&quot;

====&quot;Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe&quot;====
In this book, Ferguson offers a global history of disaster. Damon Linker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; argues that the book is &quot;often insightful, productively provocative and downright brilliant&quot;, and suggests that Ferguson displays &quot;an impressive command of the latest research in a large number of specialized fields, among them medical history, epidemiology, probability theory, cliodynamics and network theory.&quot; Linker also criticises the book&#x27;s &quot;perplexing lacunae&quot;. In a review for &quot;The Times&quot; of London, David Aaronovitch described Ferguson&#x27;s theory as &quot;nebulous&quot; 

==Opinions, views and research==

Ferguson has been referred to as a conservative historian by some commentators and fellow historians. Ferguson himself stated in a 2018 interview on the &quot;Rubin Report&quot; that his views align to classical liberalism, and has referred to himself as a &quot;classic Scottish enlightenment liberal&quot; on other occasions. Some of his research and conclusions have been criticised by commentators on the political left. In a 2011 interview, Ferguson said elements of the left &quot;love being provoked by me! Honestly, it makes them feel so much better about their lives to think that I&#x27;m a reactionary; it&#x27;s a substitute for thought. &quot;Imperialist scumbag&quot; and all that. Oh dear, we&#x27;re back in a 1980s student union debate.&quot; Ferguson endorsed Kemi Badenoch&#x27;s campaign during the July 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.

===World War I===
In 1998, Ferguson published &quot;The Pity of War: Explaining World War One&quot;, which with the help of research assistants he was able to write in just five months. This is an analytic account of what Ferguson considered to be the ten great myths of the Great War. The book generated much controversy, particularly Ferguson&#x27;s suggestion that it might have proved more beneficial for Europe if Britain had stayed out of the First World War in 1914, thereby allowing Germany to win.

Ferguson has argued that the British decision to intervene was what stopped a German victory in 1914–15. Furthermore, Ferguson expressed disagreement with the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; interpretation of German history championed by some German historians such as Fritz Fischer, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Hans Mommsen, and Wolfgang Mommsen, who argued that the German Empire deliberately started an aggressive war in 1914. Likewise, Ferguson has often attacked the work of the German historian Michael Stürmer, who argued that it was Germany&#x27;s geographical situation in Central Europe that determined the course of German history. On the contrary, Ferguson maintained that Germany waged a preventive war in 1914, a war largely forced on the Germans by reckless and irresponsible British diplomacy. In particular, Ferguson accused the British foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey of maintaining an ambiguous attitude to the question of whether Britain would enter the war or not, and thus confusing Berlin over just what was the British attitude towards the question of intervention in the war.

Ferguson accused London of unnecessarily allowing a regional war in Europe to escalate into a world war. Moreover, Ferguson denied that the origins of National Socialism could be traced back to Imperial Germany; instead Ferguson asserted the origins of Nazism could only be traced back to the First World War and its aftermath.

Ferguson attacked a number of ideas that he called &quot;myths&quot; in the book. They are listed here (with his counter-arguments in parentheses):
* That Germany was a highly militarist country before 1914 (Ferguson claims Germany was Europe&#x27;s most anti-militarist country).
* That naval challenges mounted by Germany drove Britain into informal alliances with France and Russia before 1914 (Ferguson claims the British chose alliances with France and Russia as a form of appeasement due to the strength of those nations, and an Anglo-German alliance failed to materialize due to German weakness).
* That British foreign policy was driven by legitimate fears of Germany (Ferguson claims Germany posed no threat to Britain before 1914, and that all British fears of Germany were due to irrational anti-German prejudices).
* That the pre-1914 arms race was consuming ever larger portions of national budgets at an unsustainable rate (Ferguson claims that the only limitations on more military spending before 1914 were political, not economic).
* That World War I was, as Fritz Fischer claimed, a war of aggression on the part of Germany that necessitated British involvement to stop Germany from conquering Europe (Ferguson claims that if Germany had been victorious, something like the European Union would have been created in 1914, and that it would have been for the best if Britain had chosen to opt out of war in 1914).
* That most people were happy with the outbreak of war in 1914 (Ferguson claims that most Europeans were saddened by the coming of war).
* That propaganda was successful in making men wish to fight (Ferguson argues the opposite).
* That the Allies made the best use of their economic resources (Ferguson argues that the Allies &quot;squandered&quot; their economic resources).
* That the British and the French had the better armies (Ferguson claims the German Army was superior).
* That the Allies were more efficient at killing Germans (Ferguson argues that the Germans were more efficient at killing the Allies).
* That most soldiers hated fighting in the war (Ferguson argues most soldiers fought more or less willingly).
* That the British treated German prisoners of war well (Ferguson argues the British routinely killed German POWs).
* That Germany was faced with reparations after 1921 that could not be paid except at ruinous economic cost (Ferguson argues that Germany could easily have paid reparations had there been the political will).

Ferguson uses counterfactual history in the book. He presents a hypothetical version of Europe being, under Imperial German domination, a peaceful, prosperous, democratic continent, without ideologies like communism or Italian fascism. In Ferguson&#x27;s view, had Germany won World War I, then the lives of millions would have been saved, something like the European Union would have been founded in 1914, and Britain would have remained an empire as well as the world&#x27;s dominant financial power.

The French historians Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker were dubious about much of Ferguson&#x27;s methodology and conclusions in &quot;The Pity of War&quot;, but praised him for the chapter dealing with the executions of POWs, arguing that Ferguson had exposed a dark side of the war that until then had been ignored. About &quot;The Pity of War&quot;, the American academic Michael Lind wrote:

Like the historian John Charmley, who expressed the same wish in the case of World War II, Ferguson belongs to the fringe element of British conservatism that regrets the absence of a German-British deal in the first half of the 20th century that would have marginalized the United States and might have allowed the British Empire to survive to this day. According to Ferguson, Britain should have stayed out of World War I and allowed Imperial Germany to smash France and Russia and create a continental empire from the Atlantic to the Middle East. The joke is on Ferguson&#x27;s American conservative admirers, inasmuch as he laments the defeat of the Kaiser&#x27;s Germany because it accelerated the replacement of the British Empire by the United States of America and the eclipse of the City of London by Wall Street.

The German-born American historian Gerhard Weinberg in a review of &quot;The Pity of War&quot; strongly criticized Ferguson for advancing the thesis that it was idiotic for Britain to have fought a Germany that allegedly posed no danger. Weinberg accused Ferguson of completely ignoring the chief foreign policy aim of Wilhelm II from 1897 onwards, namely &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (&quot;World Politics&quot;), and argued it was absurd for Ferguson to claim that allowing Germany to defeat France and Russia would have posed no danger to Britain. Weinberg wrote that Ferguson was wrong to claim that Germany&#x27;s interests were limited only to Europe, and maintained that if the &quot;Reich&quot; had defeated France in 1914, then Germany would have taken over the French colonies in Asia and Africa, which would have definitely affected the balance of power all over the world, not just in Europe. Finally, Weinberg attacked Ferguson for claiming that the Tirpitz Plan was not a danger to Britain and that Britain had no reason to fear Germany&#x27;s naval ambitions, sarcastically asking if that was really the case, then why did the British redeploy so much of their fleet from around the world to the North Sea and spend so much money building warships in the Anglo-German naval arms race? Weinberg accused Ferguson of distorting both German and British history and ignoring any evidence that did not fit with his thesis that Britain should never have fought Germany, stating that &quot;The Pity of War&quot; was interesting as a historical provocation but was not persuasive as history.

===Rothschilds===
Ferguson wrote two volumes about the prominent Rothschild family: &quot;The House of Rothschild: Volume 1: Money&#x27;s Prophets: 1798–1848&quot; and &quot;The House of Rothschild: Volume 2: The World&#x27;s Banker: 1849–1999&quot;. These books were the result of original archival research. The books won the Wadsworth Prize for Business History and were also short-listed for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Literary Award and the American National Jewish Book Award.

The books were widely acclaimed by historians, although they received some criticism. John Lewis Gaddis, a Cold War-era historian, praised Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;unrivaled range, productivity and visibility&quot;, while criticising the book as unpersuasive and containing contradictory claims. Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm had praised Ferguson as an excellent historian but criticised him as a &quot;nostalgist for empire&quot;. In a mixed review of a later book by Ferguson, &quot;The War of the World: History&#x27;s Age of Hatred&quot;, a reviewer for &quot;The Economist&quot; described how many regard Ferguson&#x27;s two books on the Rothschilds &quot;as one of the finest studies of its kind&quot;. Jeremy Wormell wrote that while &quot;The World&#x27;s Banker: A History of the House of Rothschild&quot; had its virtues, it contained &quot;many errors&quot; which meant it was &quot;unsafe to use it as a source for the debt markets&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Robert Skidelsky praised Ferguson, stating: &quot;Taken together, Ferguson&#x27;s two volumes are a stupendous achievement, a triumph of historical research and imagination. No serious historian can write about the connection between the politics, diplomacy, and economics of the nineteenth century in the same way again. And, as any good work of history should do, it constantly prompts us to ask questions about our own age, when once again we have embarked on the grand experiment of a world economy without a world government.&quot;

===Counterfactual history===
Ferguson sometimes uses counterfactual history, also known as &quot;speculative&quot; or &quot;hypothetical&quot; history, and edited a collection of essays, titled &quot;Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals&quot; (1997), exploring the subject. Ferguson likes to imagine alternative outcomes as a way of stressing the contingent aspects of history. For Ferguson, great forces don&#x27;t make history; individuals do, and nothing is predetermined. Thus, for Ferguson, there are no paths in history that will determine how things will work out. The world is neither progressing nor regressing; only the actions of individuals determine whether we will live in a better or worse world. His championing of the method has been controversial within the field. In a 2011 review of Ferguson&#x27;s book &quot;Civilization: The West and the Rest&quot;, Noel Malcolm (senior research fellow in history at All Souls College at Oxford University) stated: &quot;Students may find this an intriguing introduction to a wide range of human history; but they will get an odd idea of how historical argument is to be conducted, if they learn it from this book.&quot;

===Henry Kissinger===
In 2003, former American secretary of state Henry Kissinger provided Ferguson with access to his White House diaries, letters, and archives for what Ferguson calls a &quot;warts-and-all biography&quot; of Kissinger. In 2015, he published the first volume in a two-part biography titled &quot;Kissinger: 1923–1968: The Idealist&quot; from Penguin Press. The thesis of this first volume was that Kissinger was greatly influenced in his academic and political development by the philosopher Immanuel Kant, and especially by an interpretation of Kant that he learned from a mentor at Harvard University, William Yandell Elliott.

===British Empire===
Ferguson has defended the British Empire, stating, &quot;I think it&#x27;s hard to make the case, which implicitly the left makes, that somehow the world would have been better off if the Europeans had stayed home.&quot; Ferguson is critical of what he calls the &quot;self-flagellation&quot; that he says characterises modern European thought.

The moral simplification urge is an extraordinarily powerful one, especially in this country, where imperial guilt can lead to self-flagellation. ... And it leads to very simplistic judgments. The rulers of western Africa prior to the European empires were not running some kind of scout camp. They were engaged in the Atlantic slave trade. They showed zero sign of developing the country&#x27;s economic resources. Did Senegal ultimately benefit from French rule? Yes, it&#x27;s clear. And the counterfactual idea that somehow the indigenous rulers would have been more successful in economic development doesn&#x27;t have any credibility at all.

====Critical views of Ferguson and empire====
Historians and commentators have considered his views on this issue and expressed their critical evaluation in various terms, from &quot;audacious&quot; yet &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;informative&quot;, &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;troubling&quot;, to &quot;false and dangerous&quot; apologia. Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King&#x27;s College London, has stated that it was correct of Seumas Milne to associate &quot;Ferguson with an attempt to &#x27;rehabilitate empire&#x27; in the service of contemporary great power interests&quot;. In November 2011, Pankaj Mishra reviewed &quot;Civilisation: The West and the Rest&quot; unfavourably in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. Ferguson demanded an apology and threatened to sue Mishra on charges of libel due to allegations of racism.

Jon Wilson, a professor of the Department of History at King&#x27;s College London, is the author of &quot;India Conquered&quot;, a 2016 book intended to rebut Ferguson&#x27;s arguments in &quot;Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World&quot;, who catalogues the negative elements of the British Raj, and describes the &quot;Empire&quot; TV program (2003) as &quot;false and dangerous&quot;. Wilson agrees with Ferguson&#x27;s point that the British innovations brought to India civil services, education, and railways, and had beneficial side effects, but faults them for being done in a spirit of self-interest rather than altruism.

About Ferguson&#x27;s claim that Britain &quot;made the modern world&quot; by spreading democracy, free trade, capitalism, the rule of law, Protestantism, and the English language, Wilson charged that Ferguson never explained precisely how this was done, arguing that the reason was the lack of interest in the history of the people ruled by the British on Ferguson&#x27;s part, who therefore could not perceive that the interaction between the colonisers and the colonised in places like India, where the population embraced aspects of British culture and rule that were appealing to them while rejecting others that were unappealing. Wilson argues that this interaction between the rulers and the ruled is more complex, and contradicts Ferguson&#x27;s one-sided picture of the British &quot;transforming&quot; India that portrays the British as active and the Indians as passive. Wilson charged that Ferguson failed to look at the empire via non-British eyes because to do so would be to challenge his claim that Britain &quot;made the modern world&quot; by imposing its values on &quot;the Other&quot;, and that the history of the empire was far more complicated than the simplistic version that Ferguson is trying to present.

===Islam and &quot;Eurabia&quot;===
Ferguson has endorsed the work of Bat Ye&#x27;or and her Islamophobic Eurabia conspiracy theory, providing a cover comment for her 2005 &quot;Eurabia&quot; book, in which he stated that &quot;no writer has done more than Bat Ye&#x27;or to draw attention to the menacing character of Islamic extremism. Future historians will one day regard her coinage of the term &#x27;Eurabia&#x27; as prophetic.&quot; Matthew Carr wrote in &quot;Race &amp; Class&quot; that &quot;Niall Ferguson, the conservative English historian and enthusiastic advocate of a new American empire, has also embraced the Eurabian idea in a widely reproduced article entitled &#x27;Eurabia?&#x27;&quot;, in which he laments the &quot;de-Christianization of Europe&quot; and the secularism of the continent that leaves it &quot;weak in the face of fanaticism&quot;. Carr adds that &quot;Ferguson sees the recent establishment of a department of Islamic studies in his (Oxford college) as another symptom of &#x27;the creeping Islamicization of a decadent Christendom&#x27; &quot;, and in a 2004 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute entitled &quot;The End of Europe?&quot;

Ferguson struck a similarly Spenglerian note, conjuring the term &quot;impire&quot; to depict a process in which a &#x27;political entity, instead of expanding outwards towards its periphery, exporting power, implodes—when the energies come from outside into that entity&#x27;. In Ferguson&#x27;s opinion, this process was already under way in a decadent &#x27;post-Christian&#x27; Europe that was drifting inexorably towards the dark denouement of a vanquished civilisation and the fatal embrace of Islam.

Ferguson deplored the November 2015 Paris attacks committed by Islamic State terrorists but stated he was not going to &quot;stand&quot; with the French as he argued that France was a lost cause, a declining state faced with an unstoppable Islamic wave that would sweep away everything that tried to oppose it. Ferguson compared the modern European Union to the Western Roman Empire, describing modern Europe as not that different from the world depicted by Edward Gibbon in his book &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Ferguson wrote:

Uncannily similar processes are destroying the European Union today... Let us be clear about what is happening. Like the Roman Empire in the early fifth century, Europe has allowed its defenses to crumble. As its wealth has grown, so its military prowess has shrunk, along with its self-belief. It has grown decadent in its shopping malls and sports stadiums. At the same time, it has opened its gates to outsiders who have coveted its wealth without renouncing their ancestral faith.

About the 2015 European migrant crisis, Ferguson wrote the mass influx of refugees into Europe from Syria was a modern version of the &quot;Völkerwanderung&quot; when the Huns burst out of Asia and invaded Europe, causing millions of the Germanic peoples to flee into the presumed safety of the Roman Empire, smashing their way in as the Romans attempted unsuccessfully to stop the Germans from entering the empire. Ferguson argued that Gibbon was wrong to claim the Roman Empire collapsed slowly and argues that the view among a growing number of modern scholars is that the collapse of the Roman Empire was swift and violent; unforeseeable by Romans of the day, just as the collapse of modern European civilization would likewise be for modern Europeans. In 2017, Ferguson opined that the West had insufficiently heeded the rise of militant Islam and its global consequences in the same way it failed to predict that the rise of Vladimir Lenin would lead to the further spread of communism and conflict around the world.

Ask yourself how effectively we in the West have responded to the rise of militant Islam since the Iranian Revolution unleashed its Shi&#x27;ite variant and since 9/11 revealed the even more aggressive character of Sunni Islamism. I fear we have done no better than our grandfathers did.

Foreign intervention—the millions of dollars that have found their way from the Gulf to radical mosques and Islamic centres in the West.

Incompetent liberals—the proponents of multiculturalism who brand any opponent of jihad an &quot;Islamophobe&quot;. Clueless bankers—the sort who fall over themselves to offer &quot;sharia-compliant&quot; loans and bonds. Fellow travellers—the leftists who line up with the Muslim Brotherhood to castigate Israel at every opportunity. And the faint-hearted—those who were so quick to pull out of Iraq in 2009 that they allowed the rump of al-Qaeda to morph into Isis.

A century ago it was the West&#x27;s great blunder to think it would not matter if Lenin and his confederates took over the Russian Empire, despite their stated intention to plot world revolution and overthrow both democracy and capitalism. Incredible as it may seem, I believe we are capable of repeating that catastrophic error. I fear that, one day, we shall wake with a start to discover that the Islamists have repeated the Bolshevik achievement, which was to acquire the resources and capability to threaten our existence.

During a 2018 debate, Ferguson asserted that he is not anti-immigration or opposed to Muslims but felt that sections of Europe&#x27;s political and intellectual classes had failed to predict the cultural and political consequences of large scale immigration. He stated that Islam differs from Judaism and Christianity through being &quot;designed differently&quot; as a political ideology that does not recognize the separation of mosque with the secular and temporal, and that the Muslim world has mostly followed an opposite trend to Western society by becoming less secularized and more literal in interpreting holy scripture. He concluded that if Europe kept pursuing large scale migration from pious Muslim societies combined with poor structures of economic and cultural integration, especially in an era when existing migrant communities are either unassimilated or loosely integrated into the host society, it is &quot;highly likely&quot; that networks of fundamentalist &quot;dawah&quot; will grow in which Islamic extremists draw in the culturally and economically unassimilated Muslims of immigrant backgrounds. Ferguson observed that even when living in Western nations, both he and his wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali have to live with permanent security measures as a result of her public critiques of Islam and status as a former Muslim.

===Iraq War===
Ferguson supported the Iraq War and described himself a month after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, as ‘a fully paid-up member of the neo-imperialist gang’ and he is on record as being not necessarily opposed to future Western incursions around the world.

It&#x27;s all very well for us to sit here in the West with our high incomes and cushy lives, and say it&#x27;s immoral to violate the sovereignty of another state. But if the effect of that is to bring people in that country economic and political freedom, to raise their standard of living, to increase their life expectancy, then don&#x27;t rule it out.

===Donald Trump===
Ferguson was initially skeptical of Donald Trump&#x27;s bid for the 2016 United States presidential election. During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Ferguson was quoted in early 2016: &quot;If you bother to read some of the serious analysis of Trump&#x27;s support, you realize that it&#x27;s a very fragile thing and highly unlikely to deliver what he needs in the crucial first phase of the primaries ... By the time we get to March–April, it&#x27;s all over. I think there&#x27;s going to be a wonderful catharsis, I&#x27;m really looking forward to it: Trump&#x27;s humiliation. Bring it on.&quot; Trump eventually won the nomination. After Brexit, Ferguson stated that Trump could win via the Electoral College if certain demographics turned out to vote in key swing states. Three weeks before the 2016 presidential election, after the Access Hollywood tape scandal, Ferguson stated in an interview that it &quot;was over for Donald Trump&quot;, that &quot;Trump had flamed out in all three Presidential debates&quot;, that &quot;I don&#x27;t think there can be any last minute surprise to rescue him [Trump]&quot;, and that there was no hope of Trump winning Independent voters and that Trump was &quot;gone as a candidate&quot;, adding that &quot;it seems to me clear that she [Hillary Clinton] is going to be the first female President of the United States. The only question is how bad does his [Trump&#x27;s] flaming out affect candidates for the Senate, candidates for the House, further down on the ballot.&quot;

In 2018, Ferguson argued that a Clinton presidency would have been more disruptive to the United States, and that Clinton would have been &quot;immediately&quot; impeached as Trump supporters would have likely believed that the election was rigged. Ferguson stated that he regarded himself &quot;in the middle ground&quot; in a generally polarized public and media opinion on Trump&#x27;s presidency. He elaborated that while he found Trump&#x27;s personality &quot;pretty hard to take&quot;, he cited several positive achievements undertaken by his administration, including America&#x27;s stronger economic performance and noted that he found Trump&#x27;s foreign policy stances on China, North Korea, and the Middle East an improvement over that of the Obama administration. He further opined that the media was more focused on Trump&#x27;s behaviour on social media than the &quot;competent job&quot; being done by members of his administration. In 2019, he wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; arguing that the China–United States trade war was the beginning of a Second Cold War between the United States and China, and that despite the risks of the showdown the introduction of an external enemy similar to the Soviet Union could prove beneficial by reducing political polarization in the United States.

During the 2020 United States presidential election, Ferguson observed that contrary to arguments from Trump&#x27;s opponents that he only appealed to older White men, statistics showed his support among Black and Latino voters had risen. He opined that Joe Biden was likely to win the presidency but that the Democratic Party would not see a &quot;blue wave&quot; of support as it had tried to turn the election into &quot;a referendum on Trump&#x27;s handling of COVID-19&quot; when there &quot;hasn&#x27;t been anything exceptionally bad about American performance&quot;, and that the Democrats had misjudged the mood of voters concerned about law and order following the Black Lives Matter protests. After the election was concluded, Ferguson stated that both Trump and the &quot;far-left of the Democratic Party&quot; had lost. Ferguson condemned the 2021 United States Capitol attack committed by supporters of Trump, arguing on Twitter that the participants should be prosecuted and Trump&#x27;s behaviour had cost the Republicans the Senate. He also argued that politicians who refused to condemn the event were unsuited for office. He argued that Trumpism was likely to remain a force within American politics and likened it to Jacobite Pretenders who sought to revolt in order to restore the House of Stuart to the British royal throne after the Glorious Revolution.

In a May 2023 article for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Ferguson hypothesized that a Trump victory in both the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries and 2024 United States presidential election is a highly plausible outcome despite a &quot;campaign of lawfare&quot; against the former president and that tactical Democratic Party schemes or hopes for Trump to secure the nomination so as to campaign on an anti-Trump platform stand a strong chance of backfiring. Ferguson observed that Biden&#x27;s approval ratings were lower at the time of writing than Trump&#x27;s were in office and highlighted that other leaders, such as Brazil&#x27;s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Italy&#x27;s Silvio Berlusconi, and Malaysia&#x27;s Anwar Ibrahim, were able to engineer political comebacks after being barred from politics. He further stated &quot;the perception that Democratic operatives are using the legal system for political ends will likely help him win votes. It&#x27;s a much better story than his earlier claim that the 2020 election was stolen, which now bores almost everyone except Trump himself. It may seem paradoxical that the Democrats are harassing Trump in the courts if they want to run against him. But it makes sense: the prospect of him performing the perp walk attracts media coverage, and media coverage is the free publicity on which Trump has always thrived. Every column inch or minute of airtime his legal battles earn him is an inch or a minute less for his Republican rivals for the nomination.&quot;

In September 2023, Ferguson again opined that the Democrats were likely to lose the White House to Trump unless Biden stepped down. He compared Trump&#x27;s bid to Grover Cleveland who served two non-consecutive terms, argued that Biden was polling similar numbers to Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush ahead of elections they lost after one term, and that Biden&#x27;s desire to keep Kamala Harris as a running mate would harm his campaign due to her even poorer approval ratings. He also argued that scandals involving Hunter Biden would furthermore hinder Biden&#x27;s image by causing voters to feel less concern about Trump&#x27;s indictments as both cases would heighten public perception that all politicians are crooks. Ferguson concluded that the only real option for the Democrats to defeat Trump if he won the Republican nomination would be to oust Biden and nominate a younger candidate, and added: &quot;My money is on Newsom.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;CNBC&quot; in September 2024, Ferguson disputed arguments that Trump represented a threat to American democracy and argued the Harris campaign was unlikely to persuade the public to vote against Trump by making this claim. Ferguson argued that Trump&#x27;s &quot;greatest weakness&quot; was his conduct during the 2021 United States Capitol riot and refusal to accept the 2020 election result but noted that the &quot;system contained Trump&#x27;s impulses successfully in 2020 and 2021&quot;, and said that the problem with the Democratic claim that he is a threat to democracy is that for many ordinary voters it sounds overdone and is not as compelling an argument as it was in the past because voters have seen a Trump presidency.

===Trump&#x27;s &quot;New World Order&quot;===
In an article from November 2016 in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Ferguson advised that Trump should support the efforts of the prime minister Theresa May to have the United Kingdom leave the European Union as the best way of breaking up the European Union, and sign a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom once Brexit is complete. To stabilise international relations, Ferguson speculated that Trump could give recognition to Russia as a great power, and work with Vladimir Putin by giving Russia a sphere of influence in Eurasia. In the same column, Ferguson advised Trump not to engage in a trade war with China, and seek a policy of co-evolution with Xi Jinping. Ferguson argued that Trump and Putin could work for the victory of Marine Le Pen (an advocate of Frexit) and the National Front in the 2017 French presidential election, arguing that Le Pen was the French politician most congenial to the Trump administration. Ferguson argued that a quintumvirate of Trump, Putin, Xi, May, and Le Pen could then result in a stable &quot;world order&quot; that would reduce the likelihood of international conflict.

===Economic policy===
In its edition of 15 August 2005, &quot;The New Republic&quot; published &quot;The New New Deal&quot;, an essay by Ferguson and Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University. The two scholars called for the following changes to the American government&#x27;s fiscal and income security policies:
* Replacing the personal income tax, corporate income tax, Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA), estate tax, and gift tax with a 33% Federal Retail Sales Tax (FRST), plus a monthly rebate, amounting to the amount of FRST that a household with similar demographics would pay if its income were at the poverty line, similar to the FairTax proposal.
* Replacing the old age benefits paid under Social Security with a Personal Security System, consisting of private retirement accounts for all citizens, plus a government benefit payable to those whose savings were insufficient to afford a minimum retirement income
* Replacing Medicare and Medicaid with a universal Medical Security System that would provide health insurance vouchers to all citizens, the value of which would be determined by one&#x27;s health
* Cutting federal discretionary spending by 20%

In February 2010, during the Greek government-debt crisis, Ferguson appeared on the &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot; predicting that if interest rates rose in the United States, it could experience a similar sovereign default and mass civil disorder to what was occurring in Greece. He also praised the Tea Party movement. Later in the year, he called for the Federal Reserve under chairman Ben Bernanke to end its second round of quantitative easing. In November 2012, Ferguson stated in a video with CNN that the U.S. has enough energy resources to move towards energy independence and could possibly enter a new economic golden age due to the related socio-economic growth—coming out of the post-world economic recession doldrums. Ferguson was an attendee of the 2012 Bilderberg Group meeting, where he was a speaker on economic policy. Ferguson was highly critical of the results of the 2016 European Union referendum, warning that &quot;the economic consequences will be dire&quot;. Later, after backing the Remain campaign during the referendum, Ferguson changed his mind and came out in support of Britain&#x27;s exit from the European Union.

====Exchanges with Paul Krugman====
In May 2009, Ferguson became involved in a public exchange of views with economist Paul Krugman arising out of a panel discussion hosted by PEN/&quot;New York Review&quot; on 30 April 2009, regarding the American economy. Ferguson contended that the Obama administration&#x27;s policies are simultaneously Keynesian and monetarist in an &quot;incoherent&quot; mix, and specifically claimed that the government&#x27;s issuance of a multitude of new bonds would cause an increase in interest rates. Krugman argued that Ferguson&#x27;s view is &quot;resurrecting 75-year old fallacies&quot; and full of &quot;basic errors&quot;. He also stated that Ferguson is a &quot;poseur&quot; who &quot;hasn&#x27;t bothered to understand the basics, relying on snide comments and surface cleverness to convey the impression of wisdom. It&#x27;s all style, no comprehension of substance.&quot;

In 2012, Jonathan Portes, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that subsequent events had shown Ferguson to be wrong: &quot;As we all know, since then both the US and UK have had deficits running at historically extremely high levels, and long-term interest rates at historic lows: as Krugman has repeatedly pointed out, the (IS-LM) textbook has been spot on.&quot; After Ferguson wrote a cover story for &quot;Newsweek&quot; arguing that Mitt Romney should be elected in the 2012 United States presidential election, Krugman wrote that there were multiple errors and misrepresentations in the story, concluding: &quot;We&#x27;re not talking about ideology or even economic analysis here—just a plain misrepresentation of the facts, with an august publication letting itself be used to misinform readers. [&quot;The New York Times&quot;] would require an abject correction if something like that slipped through. Will &quot;Newsweek&quot;?&quot;

In an online rebuttal titled &quot;Paul Krugman Is Wrong&quot;, Ferguson defended his prior cover story, insisting that it was Krugman who had been wrong on the facts. Matthew O&#x27;Brien countered that Ferguson was still distorting the meaning of the Congressional Budget Office report being discussed, and that the entire piece could be read as an effort to deceive. In 2013, Ferguson, naming Dean Baker, Josh Barro, Brad DeLong, Matthew O&#x27;Brien, Noah Smith, Matthew Yglesias, and Justin Wolfers, attacked &quot;Krugman and his acolytes&quot; in a three-part essay explaining his dislike of Krugman. The essay title, &quot;Krugtron the Invincible&quot;, originally comes from a post by Smith.

====Remarks on Keynes&#x27; sexual orientation====
At a May 2013 investment conference in Carlsbad, California, Ferguson was asked about his views on economist John Maynard Keynes&#x27; quotation that &quot;in the long run we are all dead&quot;. Ferguson stated that Keynes was indifferent to the future because he was gay and did not have children. The remarks were widely criticised for being offensive, factually inaccurate, and a distortion of Keynes&#x27; ideas. Ferguson posted an apology for these statements shortly after reports of his words were widely disseminated, saying his comments were &quot;as stupid as they were insensitive&quot;. In the apology, Ferguson stated: &quot;My disagreements with Keynes&#x27;s economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation. It is simply false to suggest, as I did, that his approach to economic policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal life.&quot;

====Stanford Cardinal Conversations====
In spring 2018, Ferguson was involved with College Republican leaders at Stanford to oppose a left-leaning student take over of the Cardinal Conversations initiative. In leaked emails, he was quoted as asking for opposition research on the student involved. He later apologized and resigned from the said initiative when emails were leaked revealing his involvement in the events. In a statement to &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;, Ferguson wrote: &quot;I very much regret the publication of these emails. I also regret having written them.&quot;

===Cryptocurrency===
Ferguson was an early skeptic of cryptocurrencies, famously dismissing his teenage son&#x27;s recommendation to buy Bitcoin in 2014. By 2017, he had changed his mind on Bitcoin&#x27;s utility, saying it had established itself as a form of &quot;digital gold: a store of value for wealthy investors, especially those located in countries with weak rule of law and high political risk&quot;. In February 2019, Ferguson became an advisor for digital asset protocol firm Ampleforth Protocol, saying he was attracted by the firm&#x27;s plan to &quot;reinvent money in a way that protects individual freedom and to create a payments system that treats everyone equally&quot;. In March 2019, Ferguson spoke at an &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; Business Summit, where he admitted to being &quot;wrong to think there was no ... use for a form of currency based on blockchain technology... I don&#x27;t think this will turn out to be a complete delusion.&quot;

===Scottish nationalism and the British Union===
Ferguson has stated that he identified as a Scottish nationalist as a teenager but moderated his views after moving to England to study history. He has argued that Scottish nationalism is sometimes fueled by a distorted view that Scots have always been oppressed by the English and is misconceived by people from outside of the United Kingdom as the choice between being Scottish or English. Ferguson states that in contrast to the subjugations of Wales and Ireland, Scotland was united as an &quot;equal&quot; country to England during the Act of Union of 1707, and cites events such as King James VI of Scotland inheriting the English crown, the failed Darien scheme to colonize Panama, which prompted Scottish political elites to support the Union and that Scots were an integral part of the East India Company to question the narrative that Scotland was oppressed. Ferguson has also argued (citing Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Waverley&quot;) that Scotland after the Jacobite rebellion remained a land divided by warring clans and religious factions, and that the Union helped to quell some of the conflicts.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Ferguson supported Scotland remaining within the United Kingdom, citing potential economic consequences of Scottish independence but argued that the opposition campaign needed to focus on Scotland&#x27;s history of cosmopolitanism, as well as economic points to save the Union. In 2021, ahead of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Ferguson argued that the Labour Party administration under Tony Blair had made a mistake in believing devolution would stem Scottish nationalism but instead enabled the Scottish National Party (SNP) to assume regional power and criticised the SNP government of Nicola Sturgeon for its management of the Scottish economy, education and freedom of speech. Ferguson furthermore states that the best way for the British government to thwart independence and the SNP&#x27;s separationist demands was not by &quot;unthinkingly accepting the SNP&#x27;s argument that it has a moral right to a referendum on secession every time it wins a parliamentary election&quot; and allowing a slim majority vote in favour to decide the outcome but instead by following the example of Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien and minister Stephane Dion&#x27;s who handled the Parti Quebecois&#x27;s calls for Quebec secessionism by taking the matter to the Canadian Supreme Court and introducing the Clarity Act rather than letting it solely be up to &quot;a slim majority of the voters of Quebec if Canada broke up&quot;.

===European Union===
In 2011, Ferguson predicted that Grexit (the notion of Greece leaving the euro currency) was unlikely to happen but that Britain would leave the European Union (EU) in the near future as it would be easier for Britain to leave the EU owing to the fact it was not part of the eurozone and that returning to a national currency would be harder for countries who had signed up to a single currency. In 2012, he described the Eurozone as a &quot;disaster waiting to happen&quot;.

During the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Ferguson was initially critical of the idea of Britain leaving the EU despite his criticisms of the latter, warning that &quot;the economic consequences will be dire&quot;, and endorsed a Remain vote. After backing the Remain campaign (Britain Stronger in Europe), Ferguson changed his stance and came out in support of Brexit, admitting that his support to stay in had been motivated in part on a personal level by not wanting the government of David Cameron (with whom he had a friendship) to collapse and in turn risk Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. Ferguson elaborated that while Brexit would still have some economic consequences, the EU had been a &quot;disaster&quot; on its monetary, immigration, national security, and radical Islam policies. He also added that &quot;one has to recognise that the European elite&#x27;s performances over the last decade entirely justified the revolt of provincial England&quot;.

In 2020, Ferguson predicted that the EU was destined to become &quot;moribund&quot; and was at risk of collapse in the near future and that the single currency had only benefited Northern Europe and Germany in particular while causing economic havoc in Southern Europe. He also argued the &quot;real disintegration of Europe&quot; will happen over the EU&#x27;s migration policies that he says have both exacerbated and failed to provide solutions to illegal immigration to the European continent from North Africa and the Middle East. Ferguson stated that high levels of illegal immigration from Muslim-majority nations would in turn further the rise of populist and Eurosceptic movements committed to rolling back or leaving the EU. Ferguson also predicted that in a decade&#x27;s time Britain would question why there had been fuss, outcry, or debates over the manner of how to leave the EU over Brexit because &quot;we&#x27;ll have left something that was essentially disintegrating&quot;, and that &quot;it would be a little bit like getting a divorce and then your ex drops dead, and you spent all that money on the divorce courts, if only you&#x27;d known how sick the ex was. The European Union is sick, and people don&#x27;t really want to admit that, least of all in Brussels.&quot; When commenting on the ethnic diversity of the candidates for the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election, Ferguson disputed that racism or nostalgia for the British Empire had played a significant role in the vote for Brexit.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Ferguson, drawing on his research of the 1881–1896 cholera pandemic and the Spanish flu, began predicting that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a severe impact on the world in January 2020. He later criticized both the British and U.S. federal government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic as inadequate, calling them &quot;both, in their different ways, intelligible only as colossal failures by governments to make adequate preparations for a disaster they always knew to be a likely contingency&quot;. He also dismissed the idea that right-wing populism had been responsible for failure of government responses to the pandemic, accusing liberal politicians such as the then Belgian prime minister Sophie Wilmès and United States president Joe Biden of making similar mistakes to Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. He reflected in a 2021 podcast interview with Lex Fridman that many of the failures in the United States had been systemic rather than the personal fault of Trump, and that Trump was unfairly blamed because of the Trump administration&#x27;s messaging. He alleged that Barack Obama&#x27;s handling of the U.S. opioid epidemic had been similarly costly but more obscure. Ferguson also praised Operation Warp Speed, and argued that part of the reason for the failure of the U.S. government to effectively respond to the pandemic was the absence of a similar program for COVID-19 testing.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On 22 March 2022, around a month after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ferguson wrote: &quot;I conclude that the U.S. intends to keep this war going. The administration will continue to supply the Ukrainians with anti-aircraft Stingers, antitank Javelins and explosive Switchblade drones. ... It helps explain, among other things, the lack of any diplomatic effort by the U.S. to secure a cease-fire. ... Prolonging the war runs the risk not just of leaving tens of thousands of Ukrainians dead and millions homeless, but also of handing Putin something that he can plausibly present at home as victory.&quot; He also criticized the 2022 Moscow rally for justifying the invasion and described it as &quot;fascistic&quot;.

=== 2023–2024 Israel–Hamas war ===
In wake of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Ferguson said, &quot;I think it is clear that Israel can no longer co-exist with Hamas in control of Gaza. If anybody doubted that, then surely those doubts were dispelled on October the 7th with the most hideous scenes of violence against Jews since the Holocaust&quot;. He added that &quot;The issue is can Hamas be destroyed, as it should be, at an acceptable cost&quot;.

==Personal life==

Ferguson met journalist Sue Douglas in 1987, when she was his editor at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. They married in 1994, and went on to have three children. In February 2010, Ferguson separated from Douglas and thereafter started dating Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Ferguson and Douglas divorced in 2011. Ferguson married Hirsi Ali on 10 September 2011; she gave birth to their son three months later. Upset about the media coverage of his relationship with Hirsi Ali, which implied that he had begun dating her before his first marriage had unraveled, Ferguson stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t care about the sex lives of celebrities, so I was a little unprepared for having my private life all over the country.&quot;

Ferguson dedicated his book &quot;Civilization&quot; to &quot;Ayaan&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ferguson spoke about his love for Ali who, he writes in the preface, &quot;understands better than anyone I know what Western civilisation really means – and what it still has to offer the world&quot;. The couple have two sons. In a 2024 interview with Greg Sheridan, Ferguson said that he, Hirsi Ali, and their two sons were baptised in September 2023. 

Ferguson&#x27;s self-confessed workaholism has placed strains on his personal relations in the past. In 2011, Ferguson commented:

[F]rom 2002, the combination of making TV programmes and teaching at Harvard took me away from my children too much. You don&#x27;t get those years back. You have to ask yourself: &quot;Was it a smart decision to do those things?&quot; I think the success I have enjoyed since then has been bought at a significant price. In hindsight, there would have been a bunch of things that I would have said no to.

Ferguson was the inspiration for Alan Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;The History Boys&quot; (2004), particularly the character of Irwin, a history teacher who urges his pupils to find a counterintuitive angle, and who then goes on to become a television historian. Irwin, writes David Smith of &quot;The Observer&quot;, gives the impression that &quot;an entire career can be built on the trick of contrariness&quot;.

In 2018, Ferguson became naturalised as a United States citizen. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE) in the disciplines of language, literature and history in 2020. On 14 June 2024, Ferguson was awarded a knighthood in the birthday honours list of King Charles III.

<text>The Roland MC-8 MicroComposer by the Roland Corporation was introduced in early 1977 at a list price of US$4,795 (¥1,200,000 JPY). It was one of the earliest stand-alone microprocessor-driven CV/Gate music sequencers, following EMS &quot;Sequencer 256&quot; in 1971 and New England Digital&#x27;s &quot;ABLE computer&quot; (microprocessor) in 1975. Roland called the MC-8 a &quot;computer music composer&quot; and it was considered revolutionary at the time, introducing features such as a keypad to enter note information and 16 kilobytes of random access memory which allowed a maximum sequence length of 5200 notes, a huge step forward from the 8-16 step sequencers at the time. It also allowed the user to allocate multiple pitch CVs to a single Gate channel, creating polyphonic parts within the overall sequence. Due to the high price, only 200 units were sold worldwide, but it represented a huge leap forward in music technology.

==Overview==
The MicroComposer could precisely adjust multiple sound producing and effects elements of a synthesizer, such as the VCO, VCF, and other voltage-controlled components very rapidly, which is nearly impossible to do manually by a performer. The MC-8 was designed to work with large complex modular synthesizers such as the System 700 and System-100M. It could also be used during a live performance to control lighting by using pre-programmed, timed pulses, and pre-programmed timed voltage levels.

The MC-8 was based on a prototype developed by Canadian Ralph Dyck, a composer and technologist who did research and development for Roland. Roland switched to the then brand new Intel 8080A 8-bit microprocessor and increased the RAM from 512 bytes to 16KB, allowing storage of over 5,300 notes, which could be entered via the calculator keyboard (the preferred method) or recorded in real-time (not so easy). Backup was via cassette and could take 45 minutes to an hour for a three- or four-minute piece of music to back up and verify. The memory was volatile, so a loss of power meant complete loss of data. All parameters were variable so the scale and time-base could be assigned number values to suit the needs of the piece being programmed. This made the machine extremely versatile but somewhat unfriendly to approach for the first time.

While only 200 units were sold worldwide, the MC-8 was a revolutionary product. It provided storage for variables in analogue sound production, synchronization capability for multi-channel recording (the time-code could be recorded on a spare track), sufficient capacity for recording full compositions, editing capabilities and rapid access time. The MC-8 provided eight control voltage outputs and eight gate outputs, as well as a six-bit multiplex output with a special seventh bit set aside for portamento control.

==Popular music==
The earliest known band to utilize the MC-8 was the Japanese electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1978, for their self-titled album and for member Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s solo album &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;, with Hideki Matsutake as the programmer in both albums. At the time, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that the use of such computer-based technology in conjunction with synthesizers allowed Yellow Magic Orchestra to create new sounds that were not possible until then. The band later described the MC-8, along with member Hideki Matsutake who programmed it, as an &quot;inevitable factor&quot; in both their music production and live performances.

The German electronic music group Tangerine Dream also used the MC-8 on their album Force Majeure, recorded August to September 1978 at Hansa no.3 studio in Berlin. The band at one point owned 3 MC-8s. 

Richard James Burgess and John L. Walters from the band Landscape were also among the first major commercial users of the MC-8. They began experimenting with computer-programmed music and Burgess&#x27;s co-designed SDS5 electronic drums in the late 1970s making records in the emerging New Romantic, electronic dance music and synthpop genres. They triggered various synths such as the Roland System 100 and Moogs which also used CV/Gate. Burgess created the drum parts by using the multiplex outputs of the MC8 to trigger the prototype, breadboard version of the SDS5 drum synthesizer. Most of the album &quot;From the Tea-rooms of Mars&quot; (1981) was made this way and Burgess produced many other tracks this way including the European club hit &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1980) for the group Shock. Burgess and Walters demonstrated the MC-8 on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;.

<doc id="697246" wikidata="Q51543" url="?curid=697246" title="The Cat Returns">
<text>is a 2002 Japanese anime fantasy film directed by Hiroyuki Morita from a screenplay by Reiko Yoshida, based on the 2002 manga &quot;Baron the Cat&quot; by Aoi Hiiragi. It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Hakuhodo, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi and Toho, and distributed by the latter company. It stars Chizuru Ikewaki, Yoshihiko Hakamada, Tetsu Watanabe, Yosuke Saito, Aki Maeda and Tetsurō Tamba. This is Hiroyuki Morita&#x27;s first and only film as director for Studio Ghibli.

It is a spin-off of &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;. It was theatrically released in Japan on July 20, 2002, through Toho and in 2005 in the United States through Walt Disney Home Entertainment. It received generally favourable reviews, and won the Excellence Prize at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on January 16, 2018, under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.

==Plot==

Haru Yoshioka is a shy but noble high school student who has a suppressed ability to talk with cats. One day, she saves a cat from being hit by a truck on a busy road. The cat she saved turns out to be Lune, Prince of the Cat Kingdom. As thanks, the cats give Haru unwanted gifts such as catnip and mice, and she is offered the Prince&#x27;s hand in marriage. Her mixed reply is taken as a yes.

Wanting none of this, Haru hears a kind female voice which tells her to seek out Muta, a large white cat, and to get directions to the Cat Bureau from him. Muta leads her there to meet Baron Humbert von Gikkingen (the same Baron from &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;), who is a cat figurine given life by the work of his artist, and Toto, a stone raven who comes to life much like Baron. Soon after meeting them, Haru and Muta are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air. They find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: five lakes forming a cat&#x27;s paw.

Haru is treated to a feast at the castle of the Cat King. She begins to slowly turn into a cat with fangs, whiskers, a tan tail and paws, and a cat&#x27;s ears and nose, though she still remains mostly human. The King hopes that she will make a suitable bride for the Prince. At the feast, Baron (in disguise) dances with Haru as part of the entertainment. He reveals to her that the more she loses herself in the kingdom, the more cat-like she will become, and that she has to believe in herself. When Baron is discovered and forced to fight the guards, he and Haru are helped by Yuki, a white cat maiden in the palace who had previously tried to warn Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom. After Yuki shows them an escape tunnel, Haru, Baron, and Muta move through a maze to a tower that contains a portal to Haru&#x27;s world. The King goes through a series of efforts to keep them in the kingdom long enough for Haru to remain trapped in her cat form; his ultimate plan is to force her to become his daughter-in-law.

Prince Lune and his guards return to the Cat Kingdom, revealing that the King was not acting on his behalf and that he plans on proposing to Yuki. Muta is revealed to be Renaldo Moon, a notorious criminal in the Kingdom who devoured a whole lake of fish in one sitting. Haru learns that the strange voice who had advised her to go to the Cat Bureau was Yuki&#x27;s. In her childhood, Haru had saved Yuki from starvation by giving her the fish crackers she was eating, and thus, Yuki has now repaid her kindness. After she rejects the King&#x27;s marriage proposal outright, Muta tells Haru, &quot;I respect a woman who stands up for herself,&quot; and proceeds to help her escape from the King&#x27;s soldiers.

Eventually, Baron, Haru, and Muta escape the Cat Kingdom with the aid of Prince Lune and Toto, and Haru embraces her true self. She tells Baron how much she has come to like him. He tells her the doors of the Cat Bureau will be open for her again if the need ever arises. Haru returns to the human world with more self-confidence; after learning from her friend, Hiromi, that her former crush has broken up with his girlfriend, she simply replies, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.&quot;

==Voice cast==
==Production==

In 1995, Studio Ghibli released a film titled &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;, based on a manga by Aoi Hiiragi about a girl writing a fantasy novel. Although the girl&#x27;s life had no magical elements, the film featured short fantasy scenes depicting the girl writing the character of the Baron. &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; began as &quot;The Cat Project&quot; in 1999. Studio Ghibli received a request from a Japanese theme park to create a 20-minute short starring cats. Hayao Miyazaki wanted three key elements to feature in the short — these were the Baron, Muta (which appears in &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; as Moon), and a mysterious antique shop. Hiiragi was commissioned to create the manga equivalent of the short. The theme park later canceled the project. Miyazaki then took the existing work done by the &quot;Cat Project&quot; and used it as testing for future Studio Ghibli directors — the short was now to be 45 minutes long. Responsibility was given to Hiroyuki Morita, who had worked as an animator in the 1999 film &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot;. Over a nine-month period he translated Hiiragi&#x27;s &quot;Baron&quot; story into 525 pages of storyboards for what was to be &quot;The Cat Returns&quot;. Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki decided to produce a feature-length film based entirely on Morita&#x27;s storyboard; this was partly because Haru, the main character, had a &quot;believable feel to her&quot;. It became the second theatrical (third overall) Studio Ghibli feature to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Telecom Animation Film, Production I.G, and DR Movie helped animate the film.

==Release==

=== Box office ===
The film was released on July 20, 2002, as the highest-grossing domestic film at the Japanese box office in 2002 and the 7th highest-grossing film of the year overall. As of January 5, 2015, it is the 86th highest-grossing film in Japan, with ¥6.46 billion. The film grossed a total of at the box office.

===Critical reception===
 According to Metacritic, which gave a score of 70 out of 100 based on 11 critics, the film received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;catchy entertainment for kids and adults&quot; and highlighted the &quot;thrillingly imaginative&quot; finale. Michael Booth of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; noted that director Morita &quot;has a slightly cruder, more realistic sense of the world and its looniness than does Miyazaki, and you can see where &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; moves on a different track even as it pays homage to Japan&#x27;s current animation master.&quot; Neil Smith of the BBC noted that while the film &quot;can&#x27;t quite match the invention of 2003 Oscar-winner &quot;Spirited Away&quot;... &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; is still an enchanting, magical fable with a twisted vein of surrealism.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was dubbed in English by Walt Disney Pictures with the voices of Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, Elliott Gould, Tim Curry, Judy Greer, and Kristen Bell, for a release on DVD on February 22, 2005, alongside &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in the United States on June 16, 2015. GKIDS re-released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on January 16, 2018.

==Manga==


 is a 2002 manga written by Aoi Hiiragi and published by Tokuma Shoten. The story in the manga is largely the same as in its film adaptation, with a few minor differences, including a comedic ending in which the cat Natoru comes into Haru&#x27;s room and pesters her. The manga also includes a mildly dark revelation involving Haru&#x27;s cat friend from childhood, Yuki. In this version, Yuki was struck and killed by a vehicle. The Cat Kingdom is a sort of cat heaven, and Yuki helps Haru out of gratitude for feeding her fish crackers when she was a little girl. The film instead portrays the Cat Kingdom as a physically real dimension parallel to Haru&#x27;s home city.

A few character-related differences can also be seen between the manga and the film. The visual design for Baron, as originally illustrated by Hiiragi in the manga, featured him as a dark gray cat with large blue eyes and long pointed ears, while in the Studio Ghibli version, Baron is orange-and-yellow with smaller green eyes and shorter ears. This design change was carried over from the way Baron was visually portrayed in the film adaptation &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;. Haru&#x27;s hair was visually longer and darker in Hiiragi&#x27;s illustrations, although the character Muta retained his general appearance from the manga in the film adaptation. Muta is a side protagonist in both Hiiragi&#x27;s manga and the film adaptation, while in &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;, he is an antagonistic villain called &quot;Moon&quot;. Hiiragi alluded to this in the manga, which was mildly referenced in the film; Muta in the film was said to have been a morbidly obese cat who ate every fish in the kingdom as rogue outlaw &quot;Renaldo Moon&quot;, a fact he uses to frighten the Cat Kingdom into leaving Haru alone so she can escape.

<doc id="697250" wikidata="Q4917602" url="?curid=697250" title="Bishop James Madison Society">
<text>The Bishop James Madison Society (BJMS) is a secret society of the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia. The society is best known through its Last Lecture Series, held each spring semester.

== History ==
Students at the College of William &amp; Mary founded the Bishop James Madison Society in 1812, immediately after the death of its namesake. Bishop James Madison was eighth president of William and Mary and cousin to the U.S. President James Madison. The society wanted to honor Madison by doing good deeds and improving its school. It is said that the society considered the Bishop &quot;the greater of the two Madisons.&quot;

Like other secret societies at the college, the Bishop James Madison Society went defunct during the Civil War when William and Mary closed and was occupied by Union troops.

In the 20th century, William and Mary students along with David L. Holmes, professor emeritus of religious studies, revived the society. Holmes also served as the group&#x27;s campus advisor.

== Symbols ==
The society&#x27;s symbol is an elongated quatrefoil with one letter–B, J, M, or S–at the tip of each section.

== Activities ==
The society&#x27;s activities seek to foster pride in the college community and use various small and private means to recognize and thank the college&#x27;s unsung heroes. Public activities include placing banners on Old Campus to welcome new students during Convocation and families on parents&#x27; weekend, hiding plastic Easter eggs filled with candy and interesting facts about the college throughout the campus, and sponsoring coffee dates designed to increase dialogue among students, administrators, and faculty members.

It recognizes eight outstanding freshmen in the fall semester and eight outstanding seniors each spring semester. The society also sponsors special events such as the video challenge, Eight Days of Mirth, in 2014.

<doc id="697251" wikidata="Q2385117" url="?curid=697251" title="Corsair (character)">
<text>Corsair (Major Christopher Summers, USAF) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a star-faring outlaw who leads the Starjammers, the father of X-Men members Cyclops and Havok, and the supervillain Vulcan, and the grandfather of Cable, Spider-Girl, and Rachel Summers. He first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #104, and was created by Dave Cockrum.

==Concept and creation==
Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel&#x27;s two try-out series, &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Running out of patience, Cockrum showed the Starjammers, including Corsair, to &quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont, and convinced him to use the characters for this series. In order to provide a plausible excuse for the Starjammers to make repeat appearances in &quot;X-Men&quot;, they decided to make Corsair the father of Cyclops, leader of the X-Men.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Many years ago, a test pilot for NASA, United States Air Force Major Christopher Summers, was flying himself, his wife Katherine Anne, and their two young sons Scott and Alex in their private airplane, a rebuilt de Havilland Mosquito, down the Western American coast from Alaska when their plane was attacked by a starship from the alien Shi&#x27;ar Empire on an exploratory mission to Earth. The Shi&#x27;ar pursued Summers&#x27; craft to prevent Summers from making their presence on Earth known to the general public. The Shi&#x27;ar craft fired on Summers&#x27; plane, which was made of wood, causing it to burst into flame. Unable to find more than one usable parachute in time, Katherine Anne put it on her eldest son Scott, told him to hold onto Alex, and pushed them both out the plane door, hoping to save them both. Scott and Alex thus escaped the Shi&#x27;ar.

Christopher and his wife were subsequently teleported aboard the Shi&#x27;ar starship and taken to the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Throneworld of Chandilar. There, Christopher was separated from his wife and imprisoned. He soon broke free and discovered the mad Shi&#x27;ar Emperor D&#x27;Ken attempting to rape Katherine Anne. D&#x27;Ken responded to the interruption by murdering Summers&#x27; wife before his eyes, and then ordered Summers to be sent to the Slave Pits of Alsibar where criminals and political prisoners were incarcerated.

===Formation of the Starjammers===
In the Pits, Summers met four aliens who had been imprisoned for various crimes against the Shi&#x27;ar Empire – a Saurid named Ch&#x27;od, a Lupin named Cr&#x27;reee, a Mephitisoid whom Summers nicknamed Hepzibah (as her true name was unpronounceable by most not of her own species), and a Shi&#x27;ar cyborg named Raza Longknife – and together they escaped and stole a starship. Naming their vessel the &quot;Starjammer&quot;, and themselves the Starjammers, the group functioned as space pirates targeting Shi&#x27;ar vessels, thus taking vengeance on the Shi&#x27;ar but taking care not to harm innocent passengers in the process. The Starjammers quickly came to be regarded as outlaws by the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. In addition, Summers and Hepzibah became lovers.

===X-Men===
The Starjammers first met the team of superhuman Earth mutants known as the X-Men when the two groups joined forces on a world in the Shi&#x27;ar Galaxy to battle the Imperial Guard, the super-powered soldiers who served the ruling Shi&#x27;ar emperor or empress – at the time, D&#x27;ken. One of the X-Men, the cosmic being known as the Phoenix who had assumed the form of the X-Man Jean Grey, used her telepathic powers to probe Corsair&#x27;s mind and learned that he was the father of Scott Summers, who had become the X-Man known as Cyclops. At Corsair&#x27;s request, Phoenix kept his true identity a secret from Cyclops, but both Cyclops and his brother Alex, who had become the X-Man named Havok, eventually learned who Corsair really was.

===Starjammers and the Shi&#x27;ar===
Since the Starjammers aided her against the machinations of her brother D&#x27;Ken, the Shi&#x27;ar Princess Lilandra, once she was named Empress in D&#x27;Ken&#x27;s stead, put an unofficial end to the Shi&#x27;ar Empire&#x27;s opposition to the Starjammers. Corsair aided the X-Men against the Sidri, and then admitted to Cyclops that he was his father.

It would not be long before the Starjammers would become outlaws once more. The Starjammers and the X-Men fought the Brood, and battled Lilandra&#x27;s sister Deathbird. Deathbird&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état was ultimately successful, allowing her to seize the throne. Herself branded a rebel, Lilandra came to join the Starjammers in their fight against Deathbird&#x27;s tyrannical reign. Later, Corsair rescued Charles Xavier from Fenris and took Xavier into outer space to adventure with the Starjammers and be with his lover Lilandra. Corsair and the Starjammers later embarked on the Phalkon Quest. Eventually, Lilandra and the Starjammers&#x27; opposition to Deathbird&#x27;s rule sparked rebellions across the Empire, and following an attempted takeover of the Empire by the shape-shifting alien Skrulls, Lilandra settled matters with Deathbird, discovering her sister did not want the throne anymore.

The Starjammers subsequently aided Lilandra during the war with the alien Kree Empire, clashed with the Earth team of super-beings known as the Avengers, and were hired by Lilandra to capture the Shi&#x27;ar traitor named Cerise. Eventually, the Starjammers would battle with the Shi&#x27;ar Empire once more after discovering the poor treatment of the conquered Kree. The Starjammers allied themselves with a group of neutral worlds calling themselves The Clench who provided the pirates with a navigator named Keeyah. During one of the Starjammers&#x27; rescue missions, they discovered a vessel belonging to the alien Uncreated, a race of militaristic atheists who intended to destroy any culture that practiced a form of religion, including the Shi&#x27;ar. Seeing the Shi&#x27;ar as the lesser of two evils, Corsair chose to stop the Uncreated which earned the Starjammers Lilandra&#x27;s thanks and a pardon for their crimes.

Corsair sought to retire, but soon after the Starjammers were captured by the being known as the Collector. Together with the X-Man Wolverine, the Starjammers managed to escape both the Collector and the cosmic world-devourer known as Galactus. The Starjammers would later aid the Shi&#x27;ar in fending off the threat of Galactus, and subsequently helped Lilandra and Xavier during their efforts to free Earth from its sentence as an intergalactic prison planet.

===Corsair and Scott reconciled===
At one point, Scott was killed by Apocalypse, only to be resurrected after some months. After Scott&#x27;s revival, Corsair apologized to his son for not checking up on him during his time with the Starjammers. Corsair felt that since he could not keep the plane from crashing and that he could not save his own wife, that Scott and Alex were in better hands in the care of the various homes that his two sons stayed at rather than with him. This apology clearly sunk in: prior to House of M, Cyclops&#x27; student team of X-Men was called the Corsairs.

===Death===
Corsair has been reunited with Havok, his son, who brought him news about Vulcan. Corsair decided to support the X-Men (this time the group includes Rachel Summers, Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin, Polaris and Professor X) and Lilandra in preventing D&#x27;Ken from becoming emperor once more (with the help of Vulcan and Deathbird). In the midst of a battle between the Shi&#x27;ar troops loyal to Lilandra (aided by the Starjammers and X-Men) and Shi&#x27;ar troops loyal to D&#x27;Ken, Vulcan kills D&#x27;Ken and proclaims himself emperor. Corsair commands Vulcan to stop the senseless violence, but Vulcan kills Corsair. Subsequently, Alex (Havok) becomes the new leader of the Starjammers, who now include Corsair&#x27;s granddaughter Rachel, Polaris, and original members Ch&#x27;od and Raza.

===Return===
When a time-displaced teenage Jean Grey is kidnapped by the Shi&#x27;ar to be placed on trial for her actions as Phoenix, the All-New X-Men and the Guardians of the Galaxy teamed up and traveled through space to save her. It was then that they encountered Corsair, who was alive and well and back in charge of the Starjammers. The time-displaced Cyclops finds out for the first time that his father was alive. Cyclops decided to remain with the Starjammers to catch up with his father. After pillaging a Badoon ship, Corsair and his teenage son decided to travel the galaxy on their own. The time-displaced Cyclops would later learn that the Starjammers under the insistence of Hepzibah, made a deal with the mysterious Shrouded, who brought Corsair back to life. However, his resurrection came at a price, Corsair had to inject himself regularly with a nano-serum containing a collective artificial intelligence. The serum was illegal, banned by all governments across the cosmos due to the threat it posed, as it allowed A.I.s to use a living body as a host. Corsair had to go to great lengths to buy the illegal serum and to avoid arrest but there was no other way he could remain alive.

==Powers and abilities==
Corsair had no superhuman powers, though he was athletic for a man of his age. He was trained in basic hand-to-hand combat, as well as fencing skills and Shi&#x27;ar fighting techniques. He also had extensive knowledge of both terrestrial and Shi&#x27;ar weapons, and had exceptional piloting skills in both terrestrial and Shi&#x27;ar aircraft and spacecraft. He was usually armed with a saber-like Shi&#x27;ar blade, and utilized various Shi&#x27;ar weapons as needed which he carried in an extra-dimensional pocket, notable among which were twin energy blasters accessible by pressing the &quot;jewels&quot; on his gauntlets.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the harsh reality known as Age of Apocalypse, when the war against humanity by Apocalypse was just beginning, Major Christopher Summers wanted to stay and fight, but instead chose to fly his family to Canada to keep them safe.

However, as he was flying his family to safety, their plane was attacked by an alien starship. Summers pushed his sons Alex and Scott out of the plane with their only parachute. He and his wife Katherine were then abducted by the Shi&#x27;ar, and Katherine was killed after the Shi&#x27;ar, who were implanted by Brood eggs, put her under severe experiments. Meanwhile, Alex and Scott were found and raised by Mr Sinister and eventually became Prelates under the rule of Apocalypse.

Surrounded by prisoners from throughout the galaxy, Summers and his fellow prisoners bonded over their hate for the Shi&#x27;ar and formed the Starjammers. Summers eventually led a mutiny against his captors and for years the Starjammers tried to take their revenge on the Shi&#x27;ar, who were fighting a losing war of their own against the Brood. Summers apparently began to feel tired and left the Starjammers to return to Earth to reunite with his sons, however on his way, Christopher Summers tragically encountered the Brood once again and while he managed to escape he was implanted with a brood egg. As Summers crashlanded he was immediately captured by Apocalypse&#x27;s forces. For five years, Hank McCoy studied him, trying to figure out his odd DNA. Mr Sinister kept Summers&#x27; presence on Earth hidden from his two sons.

Christopher eventually escaped. He found Joe Robertson who told him what his kids had become. He lost control of his Brood half, killed Robbie, infected him with a Brood egg, and ran. Sinister sent Emplate, the Monets, Northstar and Aurora after him, but Summers shot Emplate through the chest, killing him and frying the Monets&#x27; brains. He then blew up a car, knocking out Northstar and Aurora. Summers ran to a scavenger camp, where he killed and infected all of the scavengers and their intended victim Colleen Wing.

Scott and Alex pursued him, not knowing his true identity. After they met him, he convinced them that he was their father. They were attacked by two scavengers, Mister Hyde and Cobra, and Christopher almost lost control again. They ran to an old warehouse to find shelter from the coming storm.

While sweeping the perimeter, Scott encountered a chained Misty Knight along with the bodies of Colleen Wing and the scavengers Christopher had slain. Scott and Knight returned to the warehouse, but Wing and the other &quot;dead&quot; bodies followed and attacked, transformed into Brood. They fought but lost ground until Sinister arrived to save them. Christopher lost control and fully morphed into a Brood. Sinister claimed that he had learned of Christopher&#x27;s transformation and concealed his return from Scott and Alex until he could cure their father. Christopher attacked Sinister, and then Alex, before regaining enough control to tell Scott to kill him. Scott reluctantly did so. Although Sinister offered to deal with the remains, Alex and Scott cremated Christopher&#x27;s body, depriving Sinister of the chance to analyze him further and acquire samples of Brood DNA.

===X-Men Forever===
In the &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; alternate reality, Corsair and the Starjammers settle down to work as security for Nathan Summers, his grandson, who is living with Corsair&#x27;s parents in Alaska. This mission suffers several setbacks due to a family friend being a spy for Mister Sinister.

<text>UPPAAL is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays etc.).

It has been used in at least 17 case studies since its release in 1995, including on Lego Mindstorms, for the Philips audio protocol, and in gearbox controllers for Mecel.

The tool has been developed in collaboration between the Design and Analysis of Real-Time Systems group at Uppsala University, Sweden and Basic Research in Computer Science at Aalborg University, Denmark.

There are the following extensions available:
*Cora for Cost Optimal Reachability Analysis.
*Tron for Testing Real-time systems ON-line (black-box conformance testing).
*Cover for COVERerage-optimal off-line test generation.
*Tiga for TImed GAmes based controller synthesis.
*Port for component based timed systems, exploiting Partial Order Reduction Techniques.
*Pro for PRObabilistic reachability analysis. (Discontinued)
*SMC for Statistical Model Checking.

<doc id="697272" wikidata="Q2297877" url="?curid=697272" title="Tombigbee River">
<text>The Tombigbee River is a tributary of the Mobile River, approximately 200 mi (325 km) long, in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama. Together with the Alabama, it merges to form the short Mobile River before the latter empties into Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico. The Tombigbee watershed encompasses much of the rural coastal plain of western Alabama and northeastern Mississippi, flowing generally southward. The river provides one of the principal routes of commercial navigation in the southern United States, as it is navigable along much of its length through locks and connected in its upper reaches to the Tennessee River via the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.

The name &quot;Tombigbee&quot; comes from Choctaw &quot;/itumbi ikbi/&quot;, meaning &quot;box maker, coffin maker&quot;, from &quot;/itumbi/&quot;, &quot;box, coffin&quot;, and &quot;/ikbi/&quot;, &quot;maker&quot;. The river formed the eastern boundary of the historical Choctaw lands, from the 17th century when they coalesced as a people, to the forced Indian Removal by the United States in the 1830s.

==Description==

The river begins in northeastern Mississippi just south of the Pharr Mounds near the northern county line of Itawamba County, at what was once known as the source of the east fork of the river. Historically, the beginning of the river was in northern Monroe County at the confluence of Town Creek (also known as West Fork Tombigbee River) and the east fork of the river.

The river flows east through Aberdeen Lake near Aberdeen, and Columbus Lake near Columbus. It flows through Aliceville Lake on the Mississippi-Alabama border, then generally SSE across western Alabama in a highly meandering course, past Gainesville and Demopolis. There it is joined from the northeast by the Black Warrior River. South of Demopolis it flows generally south across southwestern Alabama (forming Sumter and Choctaw counties&#x27; borders with Marengo County). Past Jackson it joins the Alabama River from the north on the Mobile-Baldwin county line, approximately 30 mi (50 km) north of Mobile; this confluence forms the Mobile River.

After the completion of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in 1985, much of the middle course of the river in northeastern Mississippi was diverted into the new, straightened channel. Above Aberdeen Lake, the waterway flows alongside the original course of the river.

In addition to the Black Warrior, the river is joined by the Buttahatchee River from the east, north of Columbus, Mississippi. To the South of Columbus, Luxapalila Creek joins with the Tombigbee River, approximately 5.2 miles from downtown Columbus. Approximately 10 mi (15 km) north of Gainesville, it is joined from the north by the Sipsey River. At Gainesville, it is joined from the west by the Noxubee River.

The Choctaw National Wildlife Refuge is along the river in southwestern Alabama, approximately 20 mi (30 km) northwest of Jackson.

The upper reaches of the Tombigbee formed the homeland of the formidable Chickasaw. The French official Bienville used the Tombigbee to travel with his forces in his 1736 campaign against the Chickasaw. In the nineteenth century, they were considered one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast, as they adopted some European-American ways. But Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, in order to remove the Native Americans and enable development by European Americans. The United States forced the Chickasaw west of the Mississippi to Indian Territory, extinguishing most of their claims to land in the Southeast.

==Lock and dams==
The Tombigbee River has five lock and dams along its length. Lock &amp; Dams are listed from north to south; the river mile indicates the distance from the mouth of the Mobile River at Mobile Bay.
* John C. Stennis Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 334.7
* Tom Bevill Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 306.8
* Howell Heflin Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 266.1
* Demopolis Lock &amp; Dam is located at river mile 213.2
* Coffeeville Lock and Dam is located at river mile 116.6.

==&quot;Cahaba&quot; incident==
On April 28, 1979, a tugboat named M/V &quot;Cahaba&quot; was on the Tombigbee near Demopolis, Alabama trying to guide two coal barges under a flooded side-span of the old Rooster Bridge (removed years later), but the flood current was too strong. The tug and barges approached the drawbridge-section, which failed to re-open fast enough while the river was near flood stage (drawbridges must close and re-open to allow waiting traffic to cross). The fast currents pinned the Cahaba&#x27;s starboard side against the bridge in high waters. The force was so great that it pulled the boat downward, tilting it beneath the bridge, and fully submerging it in the river. The underwater pressure blew out a port-side window in the pilot house, which began filling with water, while the captain remained at the helm. Soon the tugboat emerged from beneath the other side of the bridge and righted itself, with water pouring from the doorways and decks.

One of the two main ventilator funnels had tilted to the center, yet one engine was still running, and the captain steered to anchor the tugboat in a flooded cornfield. Another downstream tugboat, M/V &quot;Tallapoosa&quot;, rescued the captain and all three crew members; with the pilot, then secured the two barges of coal. The barges were later towed to Mobile by the same company&#x27;s towboat M/V &quot;Mauvilla.&quot; The Mauvilla is otherwise notable for its later involvement in the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck.

==Recreation==
Pleasure boats, cruising America&#x27;s Great Loop, use the waterway each year in the fall.

==Folklore==
The river is closely associated with several steamboat disasters, including the &quot;Eliza Battle&quot; and &quot;James T. Staples&quot;.

The &quot;Tombigbee River Waltz&quot; or the singing song &quot;Tombigbee River&quot; are beloved old time waltzes performed by fiddlers including James Bryan, Kenny Jackson, Jay Ungar and Eric Hatling. The song was featured as a Charles Ingalls song in the Little House books.

<text>Raymond Emmitt Dandridge (August 31, 1913 – February 12, 1994), nicknamed &quot;Hooks&quot; and &quot;Squat&quot;, was an American third baseman in baseball&#x27;s Negro leagues. Dandridge excelled as a third baseman and he hit for a high batting average. By the time that Major League Baseball was racially integrated, Dandridge was considered too old to play. He worked as a major league scout after his playing career ended. In 1999, Dandridge was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and, late in his life, Dandridge was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Early life==
Dandridge was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Archie and Alberta Thompson Dandridge.

He played several sports as a child, including baseball, football and boxing. After sustaining a leg injury in football, Dandridge&#x27;s father made him quit that sport. He focused on baseball, often playing with a bat improvised from a tree branch and a golf ball wrapped in string and tape.

Dandridge lived for a while in Buffalo, New York, before he and his family returned to Richmond. He played baseball locally for teams in Richmond&#x27;s Church Hill district. Dandridge became known for his short, bowed legs, which later led to nicknames including &quot;Hooks&quot; and &quot;Squat&quot;. While playing for a local team in 1933, Dandridge was discovered by Indianapolis ABCs/Detroit Stars manager Candy Jim Taylor.

==Career==
He played for the Stars in 1933 and for the Newark Dodgers, which were later called the Newark Eagles, from 1934 to 1938. While with the Eagles, Dandridge was part of the &quot;Million Dollar Infield&quot; that also consisted of Dick Seay, Mule Suttles, and Willie Wells.

In 1939, badly underpaid by the Eagles, Dandridge moved to the Mexican League, where he played for nine of the next ten seasons, rejoining the Eagles for one last season in 1944. Bill Veeck of the Cleveland Indians called Dandridge in 1947 and asked him to come play in the Cleveland organization. Though that might have given him the chance to be the first black major league player, Dandridge turned it down because he did not want to move his family from Mexico. He also realized that he had been treated well by club owner Jorge Pasquel, who was paying him $10,000 per season plus living expenses.

Pasquel died the next year in a plane crash, prompting Dandridge to return to the United States as a player-manager for the New York Cubans. Although more than capable of playing in the majors, he never got the call to the big leagues, instead spending the last years of his career as the premier player in Triple-A baseball, batting .362 and leading all American Association third basemen in fielding percentage in 1949. He batted .360 in his last minor league season in .

Dandridge was one of the greatest fielders in the history of baseball, and one of the sport&#x27;s greatest hitters for average. Monte Irvin, who played both in the Negro leagues and the major leagues and saw every great fielding third baseman of two generations, said that Dandridge was the greatest of them all, adding that Dandridge almost never committed more than two errors in a season. Dandridge was also a tutor to the young Willie Mays. Because of the &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; not to allow African Americans in Major League Baseball, Dandridge was dismissed as being too old by the time of integration.

==Later life==

After retiring from playing in 1955, Dandridge worked as a scout for the San Francisco Giants and later ran a recreation center in Newark, New Jersey. He lived his final years in Palm Bay, Florida. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in . He died at age 80 in Palm Bay.

Dandridge&#x27;s nephew, Brad Dandridge, played professional baseball from 1993 to 1998, primarily in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization.

<text>Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 7th Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Gordon (27 December 1845 – 18 January 1928), styled Lord Settrington until 1860 and Earl of March between 1860 and 1903, was a British politician and peer.

==Early life==
Styled Lord Settrington from birth, he was born at Portland Place, London on 27 December 1845. He was the eldest son of Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond and Frances Harriett Greville (1824–1887). His elder sister, Lady Caroline Gordon-Lennox, who never married, acted as chatelaine of Goodwood after their mother&#x27;s death in 1887. His younger siblings were Lord Algernon Gordon-Lennox (who married Blanche Maynard and was the father of Ivy Cavendish-Bentinck, Duchess of Portland), Capt. Lord Francis Gordon-Lennox (who died unmarried), Lady Florence Gordon-Lennox (who died unmarried), and Lord Walter Gordon-Lennox (who married Alice Ogilvie-Grant).

His paternal grandparents were Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond and Lady Caroline Paget (eldest daughter of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey and Lady Caroline Elizabeth Villiers, a daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey). His maternal grandparents were Algernon Greville (second son of Captain Charles Greville and Lady Charlotte Cavendish-Bentinck, eldest daughter of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland) and the former Charlotte Cox (a daughter of Richard Henry Cox, of Hillingdon).

In his youth, he visited America on a hunting trip to the Rocky Mountains, spending the winter in a log cabin. He was educated at Eton between 1859 and 1863. In 1860 he became known as the Earl of March after his father succeeded to the dukedom.

==Career==

Lord March joined the Grenadier Guards two years later, although he retired in 1869 after he was elected Member of Parliament for West Sussex. He represented that constituency until it was abolished for the 1885 general election, when he was returned to the House of Commons for the Chichester constituency. He held his seat until 1889. Around this time, he was appointed as an Ecclesiastical Commissioner, a position he occupied until 1903.

He served in the part-time Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia, being promoted to lieutenant-colonel in command of its 2nd Battalion on 28 June 1876. The regiment became the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment in 1881, and March was appointed its Lt-Col Commandant on 9 July 1887. March and his brother, Lord Algernon Gordon-Lennox, both served in the Second Boer War, with March commanding his battalion in South Africa from its arrival in March 1901 until its return to England in June 1902 following the Peace of Vereeniging. For his service in the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the October 1902 South African Honours list.

Lord March was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Elginshire on 27 August 1902, and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire from November 1903, after his father&#x27;s death.

On 27 September 1903, Gordon-Lennox succeeded his father as 7th Duke of Richmond and Lennox and 2nd Duke of Gordon (2nd creation) as well as the dukedom of Aubigny, which had been conferred on his ancestor Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, by French King Louis XIV. In 1904, King Edward VII made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) and a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG). He was Grand Master of the Sussex branch of the Freemasons from 1902. After his retirement from the militia, he was appointed honorary colonel of his battalion on 27 May 1906.

==Personal life==

Lord Richmond was twice married. His first marriage was on 10 November 1868 to Amy Mary Ricardo (1847–1879), daughter of Percy Ricardo, Esq. of Bramley Park, Surrey. She was the sister of Col. Horace Ricardo and of Col. Francis Ricardo. Before her death on 23 August 1879, aged 32, they had three sons and two daughters:

* Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 8th Duke of Richmond (1870–1935), who married Hilda Madeline Brassey, eldest surviving daughter of Henry Arthur Brassey, MP, of Preston Hall, in 1893.
* Lady Evelyn Amy Gordon-Lennox (1872–1922), who married Sir John Cotterell, 4th Baronet, in 1896.
* Lady Violet Mary Gordon-Lennox (1874–1946), who married Henry Brassey, 1st Baron Brassey, of Apethorpe, in 1894.
* Lord Esmé Charles Gordon-Lennox (1875–1949), a brigadier-general in the British Army who was Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod and Secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain; he married Hon. Hermione Frances Caroline Fellowes, third daughter of William Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey, in 1909. They divorced in 1923 and he married Rosamond Lorys Palmer, daughter of Vice Admiral Norman Craig Palmer, in 1923.
* Lord Bernard Charles Gordon-Lennox (1878–1914), a major in the British Army who married Hon. Evelyn Loch, second daughter of Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch, in 1907.

On 3 July 1882, he married Isabel Sophie Craven, second daughter of William George Craven (a grandson of William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven) and Lady Mary Yorke (second daughter of Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke). They had two daughters:

* Lady Muriel Beatrice Gordon-Lennox (3 October 1884 – 13 April 1969), who married Major William Malebisse Beckwith, only son of Captain Henry John Beckwith, of Millichope Park, in 1904. They divorced in 1933 and she married, on 2 August 1933, Commander Lewis Derek Jones, of Newton House, eldest son of Major-General Lewis Jones, of Stoke Lodge, Stoke Poges, in 1933.
* Lady Helen Magdalen Gordon-Lennox (1886–1965), Mistress of the Robes to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; she married Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, in 1911.

Lady Richmond died in November 1887, aged 24. Lord Richmond remained a widower until his death in London on 18 January 1928, aged 82. He was buried in Chichester Cathedral and was succeeded in the dukedom by his eldest son, Charles.

===Estate===
The duke died with assets excluding family-entrusted land such as at Goodwood House where he lived (and as his forebears was a parochial and district patron). These were probated at £310,380 (). His interests in the family-entrusted lands were proved at £1731 in 1929. In 1930, the 8th Duke was forced to sell &quot;a considerable number of pictures and books from Goodwood House and Gordon Castle, his Scottish seat near Fochabers&quot; due to the &quot;heavy succession duties and increasing taxation&quot;.

<doc id="697287" wikidata="Q13863163" url="?curid=697287" title="Martin and Osa Johnson">
<text>Martin Elmer Johnson (October 9, 1884 – January 13, 1937) and Osa Helen Johnson (née Leighty, March 14, 1894 – January 7, 1953) were married American adventurers and documentary filmmakers. In the first half of the 20th century the couple captured the public&#x27;s imagination through their films and books of adventure in exotic, faraway lands. Photographers, explorers, marketers, naturalists and authors, Martin and Osa studied the wildlife and peoples of East and Central Africa, the South Pacific Islands and British North Borneo. They explored then-unknown lands and brought back film footage and photographs, offering many Americans their first understanding of these distant lands.

==Early Lives==
Martin Elmer Johnson was born on October 9, 1884. Osa Leighty was born on March 14, 1894, and raised in Chanute, Kansas. Although born in Rockford, Illinois, Martin Johnson grew up in the Kansas towns of Lincoln and Independence. His father worked as a jeweler and would bring home crates labeled with European cities like Paris and Barcelona, inspiring Martin to stowaway on a ship to Europe as a teenager.

On his way back to Kansas, Martin Johnson read of Jack London’s plans to travel the world in a 45-foot boat, the &quot;Snark&quot;. Johnson wrote to London begging to be invited and received a telegraph simply asking if he could cook, to which Johnson replied: &quot;Just try me.&quot; On the &quot;Snark&quot;, which sailed around the world from 1907 to 1909, Johnson had a variety of responsibilities. Later, he toured the United States displaying photographs and artifacts collected on the voyage. He met Osa Leighty while showing his travelogues at the theatre in Osa&#x27;s hometown of Chanute, Kansas, where she was singing. They were married in May 1910 in Independence and spent the next seven years touring with Martin&#x27;s travelogue in the US and Europe. Martin published his book &quot;Through the South Seas With Jack London&quot; in 1913.

==Safaris==

In 1917, Martin and Osa departed on a nine-month trip through the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) and the Solomon Islands. The highlight of the trip was a brief, but harrowing, encounter with a tribe called the Big Nambas of northern Malekula. Once there, the chief was not going to let them leave. The intervention of a British gunboat helped them escape. The footage they got there inspired the feature film &quot;Among the Cannibal Isles of the South Seas&quot; (1918).

The Johnsons returned to Malekula in 1919 to film the Big Nambas once again, this time with an armed escort. The escort proved unnecessary as the Big Nambas were disarmed by watching themselves in &quot;Among the Cannibal Isles of the South Seas&quot;. Martin and Osa finished their trip in 1920 with visits to British North Borneo (now Sabah) and a sailing expedition up the coast of East Africa. After returning home, they released the features &quot;Jungle Adventures&quot; (1921) and &quot;Headhunters of the South Seas&quot; (1922).

The Johnsons&#x27; first African expedition, from 1921 to 1922, resulted in their feature film &quot;Trailing Wild African Animals&quot; (1923).

During the second and longest trip, from 1924 to 1927, the Johnsons spent much of their time in northern Kenya by a lake they dubbed Paradise, at Mount Marsabit. The movies &quot;Martin&#x27;s Safari&quot; (1928), &quot;Osa&#x27;s Four Years in Paradise&quot; (1941), and the film &quot;&quot; (1928) were made with footage of these trips.

In 1925, Osa and Martin met the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, while on safari in Kenya.

The third African safari from 1927 to 1928 was a tour of the Nile with friend and supporter George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak. Film of this trip, along with previous footage, was made into one of the first talkies for the Johnsons, &quot;Across the World with Mr. and Mrs. Johnson&quot; (1930), a cinema serial which included Martin&#x27;s narrative.

In 1928, three Eagle Scouts were selected in national competition to go on safari with the Johnsons in East Africa: Robert Dick Douglas, Jr., of North Carolina, David R. Martin, Jr., of Minnesota, and Douglas L. Oliver of Georgia. The three scouts co-authored the 1928 book &quot;Three Boy Scouts in Africa: on Safari with Martin Johnson&quot;. In later life, Douglas (1912-2015) was an attorney, Martin (1913-2004) became an executive in the Boy Scouts of America, and Oliver (1913-2009) was an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at both Harvard University and the University of Hawaii.
From 1929 to 1931, the Johnsons spent a fourth tour in Africa in the Belgian Congo. There they filmed the Mbuti people of the Ituri Forest and the gorillas in the Alumbongo Hills. The 1932 feature movie &quot;Congorilla&quot; was in part a product of this trip, and was the first movie with sound authentically recorded in Africa.
In 1932, the Johnsons learned to fly at the Chanute Municipal Airport (now named the Chanute Martin Johnson Airport) in Osa&#x27;s hometown of Chanute. Once they had their pilot&#x27;s licenses, they purchased two Sikorsky amphibious planes, a S-39-CS &quot;Spirit of Africa&quot; and S-38-BS &quot;Osa&#x27;s Ark&quot;. On their fifth African trip, from 1933 to 1934, the Johnsons flew the length of Africa, getting now classic aerial scenes of large herds of elephants, giraffes, and other animals moving across the plains of Africa. They were the first pilots to fly over Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya in Africa and film them from the air. The 1935 feature film &quot;Baboona&quot; was made from this footage.

On January 3, 1935, &quot;Baboona&quot; was shown on an Eastern Air Lines plane, becoming the first sound movie shown during flight. The movie premiered on January 22, 1935, at the Rialto Theatre in New York City. In 1935, the Johnsons were featured on Wheaties cereal boxes as &quot;Champions of Sports.&quot; Osa Johnson was the second female to appear on the box and she and Martin were the first married couple selected for this honor.

The Johnsons&#x27; final trip together took them to British North Borneo again, from 1935 to 1936. They used their smaller amphibious plane, now renamed &quot;The Spirit of Africa and Borneo&quot;, and produced footage for the feature &quot;Borneo&quot; (1937). Martin Johnson was a member of the Adventurers&#x27; Club of New York. He described the Borneo expedition before the club on November 19, 1936, the event being called &quot;Martin Johnson Night.&quot; He previewed his &quot;Borneo Pictures&quot; before the group on December 17, 1936.

In January 1937, Martin and Osa began a nationwide lecture and radio tour at the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. On the morning of January 12, they boarded a flight bound for Las Vegas and Burbank. The plane crashed in bad weather near the Los Pinetos peak in California. Martin died the following day. Osa was severely injured but recovered and gave hundreds of lectures from a wheelchair. By October 1937, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was publishing dispatches of Osa&#x27;s latest trip to Africa, in which she described lifestyles and practices of the Maasai and other tribes. She died in New York City of a heart attack in 1953.

Osa Johnson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I Married Adventure&quot; was the best-selling non-fiction book of 1940.

==&quot;Osa Johnson&#x27;s The Big Game Hunt&quot;==

Television&#x27;s first wildlife series, &quot;Osa Johnson&#x27;s The Big Game Hunt&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Big Game Hunt&quot;, premiered in 1952. The 26 half-hour episodes were released by Explorers Pictures and primarily used Johnson film. Episodes introduced by Osa Johnson were &quot;African Army,&quot; &quot;Boy Scouts in Africa,&quot; &quot;Climbing Fish, The Floating Terror, Giant Elephants, Goring Brutes, Headhunters of Borneo, Jungle Panic, Jungle Power,&quot; &quot;Jungle Warriors,&quot; &quot;Rhinoceros,&quot; &quot;Simba&#x27;s Trail,&quot; &quot;Slinking Fury&quot; and &quot;Weird Tribes.&quot; Episodes introduced by Ivan T. Sanderson were &quot;Armed Menace,&quot; &quot;Cameras in the Wilderness,&quot; &quot;Herds of Destruction,&quot; &quot;Jaws of Death,&quot; &quot;Kill to Live,&quot; &quot;Man-Eaters of the Masai,&quot; &quot;Monkey Safari,&quot; &quot;Orang-utan,&quot; &quot;Pygmy Hunters,&quot; &quot;Return to Adventure,&quot; &quot;Terror of the Plains&quot; and &quot;Trek Through the Wild Lands.&quot;

==Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum==
The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum is located in Osa&#x27;s hometown of Chanute, Kansas. Formed in 1961 to preserve the Johnsons&#x27; achievements and to encourage further research into their fields of study, the Safari Museum (as it was originally named) has grown and flourished. The museum started with a core collection of the Johnsons&#x27; films, photographs, manuscripts, articles, books, and personal belongings donated by Osa&#x27;s mother. The museum shares the beautiful old railroad depot with the Chanute Public Library.

In 1998, the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum was named by the History Channel Traveler website as one of the &quot;Top-Ten Historic Sites for Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; that &quot;capture romance, American-style.&quot; In 2001, The Pitch (newspaper) named Chanute, Kansas, and the museum as &quot;Best Romantic Day Trip.&quot;

The museum is governed by a twelve-member volunteer Board of Trustees. Additionally, there are honorary trustees who help support and represent the museum. Honorary trustees include: Jack Badal, Robert Ballard, Kevin Brownlow, M. Miller Davis &amp; Ayden Mayeri, Nancy Durbin, Jack Hanna, Ed Elbert (producer of, among others, &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;), Kelly Enright, Joyce Harrell, Dick Houston (president of Elefence International), Yvonne Houston (Osa&#x27;s niece), Eleanor &amp; Pascal Imperato, Schuyler Jones, Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker, Lamont Lindstrom, Kenneth Love, Kate &amp; T.J. Miller, Margaret Moore, Kay &amp; George Schaller, Igor Sikorsky, Jr. (son of Igor Sikorsky), Jan &amp; Romi Svatoš, Roy Thomas, Stan Walsh (Travel Adventure Cinema Society), Keith Wauchope (United States Ambassador to Gabon, retired), Holly Wofford (Lake Paradise Entertainment producer) and Ray Woods.

Honorary trustees in memoriam include: Marianna Beach, Vern Carstens (the Johnsons’ pilot), Gary K. Clarke (director emeritus of the Topeka Zoo and president of Cowabunga Safaris), Clive Cussler, Dick Douglas, Clarke Getts (Osa&#x27;s second husband), Byron Harrell, Belle Leighty (Osa&#x27;s mother), David Martin, Douglas Oliver, Mike Resnick, C. Jackson Selsor, Kenhelm Stott, Jr. (general curator emeritus of the San Diego Zoo and trustee of the National Underwater and Marine Agency), Lowell Thomas, Joseph Tilton (Johnsons’ cameraman), Mahlon Wallace III and Helen (Joyce) &amp; George Wauchope (Helen was the Johnsons’ secretary who previously worked for Lowell Thomas).

==Sister museums – Musée de Manega and Sabah Museum==
The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum has two international sister museums: Musée de Manega in Burkina Faso and Sabah Museum in Sabah, Malaysia. These partnerships resulted from curatorial exchanges in 2000 and 2004 through the International Partnerships Among Museums program.

On February 22, 2011, the Sabah Museum opened its &quot;Safari in Sandakan&quot; exhibit at the Sandakan Heritage Museum in Sabah, Malaysia. This exhibit covers the Johnsons&#x27; 1920 and 1935-1936 Borneo expeditions and was designed by Sabah Museum Curator Stella Moo.

The SUARA Community Filmmaking, in partnership with the Sabah Museum and the Sabah Society, has agreed on premiering the last film of Osa and Martin Johnson&#x27;s last adventure in North Borneo. It was premiered on 30 September 2012 at the Borneo Eco Film Festival as it was the first time shown in Borneo.

==Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom Lodge==
The Walt Disney Company was the first organization to license Johnson film from the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum for the 1976 program &quot;Filming Nature&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;. Disney again licensed Johnson film as part of the &quot;Rafiki&#x27;s Planet Watch&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom when it opened April 22, 1998.

The architects and Disney team developing a new &quot;safari lodge&quot; borrowed Johnson films from the museum in 1997 and 1998 for research and inspiration. Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom Lodge opened April 16, 2001. Included is an ongoing exhibit of 36 Johnson photographs along with an original copy of Osa Johnson&#x27;s 1940 autobiography &quot;I Married Adventure&quot; in the lodge&#x27;s Sunset Lounge.

==Martin + Osa==
Martin and Osa Johnson were the namesake, inspiration and background story for the 2006-2010 Martin + Osa clothing line and national chain of 28 Martin + Osa stores launched by American Eagle Outfitters. Martin + Osa used references to the Johnsons on their clothing and accessories. Examples included &quot;1910&quot; (the year Martin and Osa married), &quot;S-38&quot; (refers to the Sikorsky S-38 amphibian airplane flown by the Johnsons) and &quot;NC-52V&quot; (the aircraft registration number of their Sikorsky S-39). In 2016 the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum acquired the Martin + Osa trademarks.

*Osa Johnson (also known as The Woman in the Safari Outfit) is a main character in the 1962 play &quot;Chamber Music&quot; by Arthur Kopit.
*It has been noted the animated film &quot;Up&quot; (2009) contains story elements similar to the Johnsons’ real-life story. This ranges from a childless couple to a “scout” on the trip. Muntz&#x27;s airship, named &quot;Spirit of Adventure&quot;, sounds like a cross between the Johnsons’ &quot;Spirit of Africa&quot; plane and Osa&#x27;s popular &quot;I Married Adventure&quot; autobiography. A fictional poster promotes the launch of the “Spirit of Adventure” on April 25, 1934, from New York City. Coincidentally this was the starting point and the time frame of the Johnsons’ 1933-1934 “Flying Safari”. Also, the Fredricksens’ dream of a home overlooking “Paradise Falls” is reminiscent of the home the Johnsons built overlooking “Lake Paradise” or “Paradise Lake”.

*In 2010, Martin and Osa Johnson were voted one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas! People (Kansas Sampler Foundation).
*Poet Elizabeth Bishop&#x27;s poem &quot;In the Waiting Room&quot; references a picture of Martin and Osa Johnson in a February, 1918 &quot;National Geographic&quot; she read as a child.
* Martin Johnson is sarcastically referenced in &quot;The Baby in the Icebox,&quot; a short story by James M. Cain that was first published in the &quot;American Mercury&quot; magazine in 1932.
*In 1934, Martin and Osa Johnson became the first married couple, and Osa only the second woman, featured on a box of Wheaties breakfast cereal. Beginning that year Wheaties put pictures of well-known people on cereal boxes to match the slogan ”The Breakfast of Champions.” Martin and Osa are pictured atop their Sikorsky S-39 amphibious plane.

<text>A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. Any transaction involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. A financial transaction always involves one or more financial asset, most commonly money or another valuable item such as gold or silver.

There are many types of financial transactions. The most common type, purchases, occur when a good, service, or other commodity is sold to a consumer in exchange for money. Most purchases are made with cash payments, including physical currency, debit cards, or cheques. The other main form of payment is credit, which gives immediate access to funds in exchange for repayment at a later date.

==History==
There is no evidence to support the theory that ancient civilizations worked on systems of barter. Instead, most historians believe that ancient cultures worked on principles of gift economy and debt. In a gift economy, valuables are given without any formal declaration of repayment, often thought to be a form of reciprocal altruism. Official systems of credit and debt were first created around 1800 BCE by the Babylonians, who established the first formal interest rate limits with the Code of Hammurabi.

Many cultures around the world began using commodity moneyobjects whose value comes from their intrinsic value. These often included gold or silver coins, along with non-metal objects such as cowrie shells, beaver pelts, and dried corn. Between 1000 BCE and the first millennium CE, coinage became increasingly common throughout Europe and Asia. In England, banknotes were introduced starting in the 17th century. Each note promised to pay the bearer the value in gold upon demandthis is called a gold standard. In the 20th century, many countries gradually phased out the gold standard in favour of fiat moneymoney that is not backed by any commodity.

Since the start of the 21st century, online banking has become much more widespread. By 2001, tens of millions of people were doing their banking on the internet. By 2012, between 46 and 82 percent of all transactions were done electronically. Digital currencies, currency that is stored on electronic systems, have gained popularity. Bitcoin, invented in 2009, reached a cap of over US$1 trillion in 2021. One of the downsides of cryptocurrencies is that since they are not tethered to any tangible assets, their price can fluctuate wildly, sometimes by 20% or more in a single day.

==Types of transactions==

=== Cash transactions ===
A cash transaction is any transaction where money is exchanged for a good, service, or other commodity. Cash transactions can refer to items bought with physical money, such as coins or cash, or with a debit card. These differ from credit transactions because the money is immediately taken from the buyer and given to the seller.

=== Credit transactions ===

Transactions that use credit involve a deferred payment for the goods or services rendered. When something is bought using credit, it gives the seller an asset (the payment at a later date) and gives the buyer a liability (the amount that must be paid at a later date). Credit cards are an example of when credit is used, where the card issuer (usually a bank) gives the customer a line of credit with which they can make purchases. The liabilities the customer accrues with the card are usually paid off at a set date, and any unpaid liabilities create interest for the issuer.

Loans and mortgages are examples of credit. The lender agrees to give out a lump sum (the &quot;principal&quot;) to the borrower, who pays back the loaned amount over a set period of time (called a &quot;term&quot;). The lender usually charges an additional percentage on top of the initial amount borrowed, called the &quot;interest rate&quot;. Mortgages are similar to loans, but are usually for a larger amount of money and over a longer term, often for buying real estate. Mortgages are almost always secured by collateral, most commonly the real estate they are being used to purchase. If the borrower fails to make the necessary payments on the mortgage, the lender has the right to claim and sell the property in a process known as foreclosure.

=== Internal and external transactions ===
External transactions are any business transactions that involve more than one party. For example, a company buying inventory from a supplier would be considered external. All cash and credit transactions are external, since they affect the finances of more than one person or group. On the other hand, internal transactions only affect one business. Shifting goods between different departments in a business is an internal transaction, since it does not change the overall finances of the company.

<text>Stephen Wiltshire (born 24 April 1974) is a British architectural artist and autistic savant. He is known for his ability to draw a landscape from memory after seeing it just once. His work has gained worldwide popularity.

In 2006, Wiltshire was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to art. In the same year, he opened a permanent gallery on the Royal Opera Arcade in London.

==Early life==
Stephen Wiltshire was born in London in 1974 to Caribbean parents; his father, Colvin, was a native of Barbados, and his mother, Geneva, is a native of St. Lucia. He grew up in Little Venice, Maida Vale, London. Wiltshire was non-verbal when young. At the age of three, he was diagnosed with autism. The same year, his father died in a motorbike accident.

At the age of five, Wiltshire was sent to Queensmill School in London where he expressed interest in drawing. His early illustrations depicted animals and cars; he is still extremely interested in American cars and is said to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of them. When he was about seven, Wiltshire became fascinated with sketching landmark London buildings. After being shown a book of photos depicting the devastation wrought by earthquakes, he began to create detailed architectural drawings of imaginary cityscapes.

In June 2015, the BBC&#x27;s Lucy Ash reported: &quot;Soon people outside the school started noticing Stephen&#x27;s gift and aged eight he landed his first commission—a sketch of Salisbury Cathedral for the former Prime Minister Edward Heath&quot;. When he was ten, Wiltshire drew a sequence of drawings of London landmarks, one for each letter, that he called a &quot;London Alphabet&quot;.

In 1987, Wiltshire was part of the BBC programme &quot;The Foolish Wise Ones&quot;. &quot;Drawings&quot;, a collection of his works, was published that same year.

Between 1995 and his graduation in 1998, Wiltshire attended the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, Lambeth, South London.

==Career==
Wiltshire can look at a subject once and then draw an accurate and detailed picture of it. He frequently draws entire cities from memory, based on single, brief helicopter rides. For example, he produced a detailed drawing of four square miles of London after a helicopter ride above that city. His nineteen-foot-long drawing of 305 square miles of New York City is based on a twenty-minute helicopter ride. He also draws fictional scenes, for example, St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral surrounded by flames.

Wiltshire&#x27;s early books include &quot;Drawings&quot; (1987), &quot;Cities&quot; (1989), &quot;Floating Cities&quot; (1991), and &quot;Stephen Wiltshire&#x27;s American Dream&quot; (1993). &quot;Floating Cities&quot; was number one on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; best-seller list.

In 2003, a retrospective of his work, &quot;Not a Camera: the Unique Vision of Stephen Wiltshire&quot;, was held in the Orleans House gallery in Twickenham, London.

In May 2005 Wiltshire produced his longest ever panoramic memory drawing of Tokyo on a canvas within seven days following a helicopter ride over the city. Since then he has drawn Rome, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Madrid, Dubai, Jerusalem and London on giant canvasses. When Wiltshire took the helicopter ride over Rome, he drew it in such great detail that he drew the exact number of columns in the Pantheon.

In October 2009 Wiltshire completed the last work in the series of panoramas, an memory drawing of his &quot;spiritual home&quot;, New York City. Following a 20-minute helicopter ride over the city he sketched the view of Manhattan, the Hudson shoreline of New Jersey, the Financial District, Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and Brooklyn over five days at the Pratt Institute, a college of art and design in New York City. This piece is now located at the Empire State Building, on the 86th floor observation deck.

In 2010, he made a panorama of Sydney to raise funds for and awareness of Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect). He visited Bermuda National Gallery where the sale of his donated drawing of Hamilton raised over $22,000. In June 2010, Christie&#x27;s auctioned off his oil painting &quot;Times Square at Night&quot;.

Wiltshire started a tour of China in September 2010, with a first project taking him to Shanghai.

A 2011 project in New York City involved Wiltshire&#x27;s creation of a panoramic memory drawing of New York which is now displayed on a long giant billboard at John F. Kennedy International Airport. It is a part of a global advertising campaign for the Swiss bank UBS that carries the theme &quot;We will not rest&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported. Also that year, he appeared on Top Gear.

In July 2014, Wiltshire drew an aerial panorama of the Singapore skyline from memory after a brief helicopter ride, taking five days to complete the 1 x 4m artwork. The artwork was presented to President Tony Tan as the Singapore Press Holding (SPH)&#x27;s gift to the nation in celebration of Singapore&#x27;s 50th birthday in 2015, and will be displayed at Singapore City Gallery, visitor centre of the country&#x27;s urban planning authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority.

Stephen Wiltshire&#x27;s feature-length documentary titled &quot;Billions of Windows&quot; premiered in London on the 13th of November 2019.

==Recognition==
Wiltshire&#x27;s work has been the subject of many TV documentaries. Neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote about him in a chapter on prodigies in his book &quot;An Anthropologist on Mars&quot;.

In 1989, Wiltshire appeared on the cover of &quot;You&quot; magazine with actor Dustin Hoffman, who had portrayed autistic savant Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 Oscar-winning film, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, which Wiltshire considers to be one of his favourite movies.

In 2006, Wiltshire was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to art. In September 2006 Wiltshire opened his permanent gallery in the Royal Opera Arcade, Pall Mall, London.

On 15 February 2008, ABC News named him &quot;Person of the Week&quot;.

In July 2009 he acted as ambassador of the Children&#x27;s Art Day in the United Kingdom.

In 2011, Wiltshire was made an honorary Fellow of the Society of Architectural Illustrators (SAI). In January 2015, Wiltshire was also made an honorary Fellow of The Scottish Society of Architect Artists.

<text>Boxer TV Access is a Swedish brand owned by Tele2 AB providing pay television channels on the digital terrestrial television network in Sweden. Modeled on the British ITV Digital, it was founded in October 1999. Some channels on the Swedish DTT are free-to-air, but most of the channels require subscription from Boxer. Boxer has claimed to have around 500,000 subscribers by June 2016 when it was acquired by ComHem.

Boxer offers dozens of channels, with the number of channels varying depending on location and how one wants to count. As of early 2008, channels from Boxer broadcast on four national transmitter networks, of which three (MUX2, MUX3 and MUX4) can be received by 98 percent of the population using a regular antenna. The fourth network, named MUX5, has lower coverage. Another transmitter network (MUX1) has higher coverage but it doesn&#x27;t contain any Boxer channels.

The majority shareholder was held in Boxer TV Access by Teracom which is owned by the Swedish state. The British venture capital firm 3i held a 30 percent stake. Teracom acquired this 30% stake from 3i in November 2008. Teracom sees this 100% stake as a logical next step. 3I had held the 30% having acquired the shares from Skandia Media Invest in 2005. With its 100% stake, Teracom moves from majority to sole shareholder in Boxer.

&quot;Teracom has always been the main shareholder in Boxer and acquiring all the shares is a logical continuation of that ownership. Boxer will continue its successful business in the same manner as before, that is being a pay-TV operator dedicated to terrestrial platforms and working independently of any individual broadcaster&quot;, says Crister Fritzson, CEO of Teracom.

In March 2008, Boxer TV A/S, a subsidiary of Boxer TV Access, won the franchise to build and operate the terrestrial pay television platform in Denmark. In February 2009 it launched this service in Jutland covering West Denmark. This service will extend during 2009 to most of Denmark.

In 2008, Boxer announced that it had put in a bid to operate three of the four multiplexes of the DTT service for Ireland, in conjunction with Irish company Communicorp. On 21 July 2008 Boxer DTT Ireland were awarded the Irish franchise Boxer TV Ireland subject to contract. However, on 20 April 2009 the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland announced that contract negotiations had ended and Boxer DTT Ireland had withdrawn its application to operate the multiplexes.

In 2016, Sweden&#x27;s operator Com Hem announced it had acquired Boxer TV-Access AB for an enterprise value of SEK 1,330m.

==History==
At the beginning, what would become Boxer&#x27;s business was laid with two companies: Senda, which rented out the program cards that would decrypt the broadcasts, and Boxer, which would rent out digital boxes and sell subscriptions.

Senda i Sverige AB was formed in December 1997 and was initially majority owned by Radiotjänst in Kiruna (60 percent) while Teracom owned the rest. The following year, TV4 AB began to lobby for them to also become part owners of Senda. And so it was, after which Senda was owned by SVT, UR, TV4 and Teracom. However, TV4&#x27;s co-ownership caused protests from other commercial channels and TV4 therefore chose to leave Senda on 18 December 1998. Senda later became principally owned by Teracom. SVT remained with a minority position in Senda until 2002.

During the digital ground network&#x27;s first year, things went slowly. When broadcasts began in April 1999, very few people could watch the digital broadcasts. In October 1999, Boxer began to build up his business. Then Anders Appelqvist was CEO and 500 households had a digital box. The supply was thin. In addition to the usual terrestrial channels, there were SVT24, TV8 and Canal+&#x27;s channels as well as some local channels; TV4 had started broadcasting as late as September. In January 2000, 4,000 households had rented digital TV boxes.

On January 31, Kanal 5 and TV3 began broadcasting, and in March ZTV, Viasat Sport and TV1000 also began broadcasting.

Boxer was originally Teracom&#x27;s subsidiary. In April 2000, Skandia joined as a partner.

At the beginning of 2001, Boxer had 44,000 customers. On January 1, 2001, MTG decided to charge an extra fee of SEK 115 for TV3, ZTV and TV8 to cover, according to them, lost advertising revenue. This brought Boxer&#x27;s sales to a standstill. On June 19, MTG decides to completely stop broadcasting in the terrestrial network in August. When MTG stopped broadcasting, Boxer had 80,000 customers. In addition, CEO Anders Appelkvist resigned and was replaced by Crister Fritzson later in the year.

At that time, Boxer had interactive services in the form of the Boxerportalen, also called Boxer.tv, which was a web portal that Boxer&#x27;s customers could visit via their TV using their set-top boxes. The portal included news, games, the chat channels &quot;Chatziki&quot; and &quot;Poolen&quot; as well as an email service.

MTG was replaced later in the year by other channels. Eurosport, CNN and Nickelodeon began broadcasting on August 1, 2001. On December 3, MTV, VH1, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet also began broadcasting. In 2001, the company was also restructured and the number of employees was reduced from 90 to 30. In February 2002, Boxer changed further. The interactive services the company had previously were removed because it did not attract customers. The model based on Boxer renting out the digital boxes was also replaced by the retailers providing the decoder, which in practice meant that the customers had to own their own decoder.

In 2002, Boxer and Senda merged.

At the turn of the year 2002/2003, Boxer had 140,000 customers. In December 2003, Boxer reached 200,000 customers. After that, sales of subscriptions took off. After TV3 and ZTV started broadcasting in the digital terrestrial network again in March 2004, Boxer was able to offer the most watched Swedish channels, something that made sales really take off. TV3 and ZTV originally broadcast unencrypted for a few months, but became part of the encrypted offering in the fall. On December 31, 2004, Boxer had 375,000 customers, which was an increase of 175,000 during the year 2004. After the first quarter of 2005, Boxer had 410,000 customers, they state themselves.

In April 2005, Skandia Liv sold its holdings in several unlisted companies, including Boxer. New 30 percent owner thus became the British venture capital company 3i. At mid-year 2005, Boxer claimed to have 450,000 customers. After the switching off of the analogue network on Gotland, Crister Fritzon stated that &quot;a majority of the Gotlanders who got digital TV in the weeks before the transition, seem to have got pay TV and the majority of them Boxer&quot;. The 500,000th customer arrived in November 2005 and was, according to Boxer, a woman in Östergötland who was given a PVR box at a ceremony in Motala (the days before the mast there was to be switched off for analogue broadcasts).

In the autumn of 2004, the &quot;Tvillingpaketet&quot; (later renamed the Tvillingkortet) was launched, which gave discounted access to the Boxer package&#x27;s channels on an extra card for those who were already Boxer customers. A special &quot;Barnkort&quot; with children&#x27;s channels and a &quot;Short-term card&quot; (later renamed a cash card) which gave access to the Boxer package&#x27;s channels for a limited time without commitment were launched in May 2005.

In the spring of 2008, Boxer won a license from the Danish state to start and operate digital pay TV services in Denmark. The license ran for 12 years with exclusive rights and the license was won in strong competition with MTG and Telenor. On 21 July Boxer, in a consortium with BT (British Telecom) and Communicorp, won the license to operate pay TV in Ireland, here again in strong competition from other operators.

At the beginning of 2009, Boxer had 689,000 customers.

At the end of 2010, the first national HDTV broadcasts were launched, which use the new broadcast technology DVB-T2 as opposed to older DVB-T which was used for local test broadcasts in the Mälardalen by SVT&#x27;s HD channel SVT HD until spring 2010. At the end of 2010, SVT&#x27;s HD broadcasts made a comeback in the digital terrestrial network, but instead of an HD channel that combined SVT&#x27;s range, both SVT1 and SVT2 were launched as HD channels with the same range as in the SD range. Both are free channels. Boxer launched an optional HD package at the end of 2010 for customers with either of the two major program offerings Boxer Mix or Boxer MAX. The optional HD package includes MTVN HD (which does not have the same range as MTV but is more focused on music videos and concerts), National Geographic HD, TV3 HD, TV4 HD and Kanal 5 HD. TV4&#x27;s HD channel TV4 HD, which was planned to start broadcasting around the turn of the year between 2010 and 2011, thus did not become a free channel unlike TV4 in SD which was part of the free offer for which no subscription is required. Kanal 5 HD started broadcasting on February 1, 2011, TV3 HD on March 1, 2011 and TV4 HD started after delays on March 3, 2011. In April 2011, Boxer became the first Nordic TV provider to broadcast 3DTV via the terrestrial network.

==Channels==
Note:
For a period Radio services SR P1, SR P2 and SR P3 were broadcast in the Swedish DTT network as a test transminssion but this has been discontinued.

* MPEG-4 indicates that the channel requires a DVB-T or DVB-T2 receiver with MPEG-4 support.
* HDTV indicates that the channel requires a HD-ready TV and a DVB-T2 HDTV receiver.

==Monopoly distribution==
Boxer had a monopoly for encrypted of television signals in the digital terrestrial network. If a broadcaster got to distribute television it had to either broadcast free-to-air or use the encryption services of Boxer. This was a contravention to European Union rules which require that there is an open market for radio and television broadcasting. On 17 October 2006 the European Commission announced that it was taking Sweden to the European Court of Justice for failure to abolish the monopoly. Neelie Kroes, Commissioner for Competition, said: &quot;I regret that I have had to refer Sweden to the Court, but Swedish viewers should no longer be denied their right, guaranteed by (EU) law, to choose digital terrestrial TV suppliers&quot;.

The case against Sweden at the European Court of Justice taken by the European Commission, has since been withdrawn as a result of Sweden&#x27;s amendment of the broadcast regulations. Previously, Sweden only allowed a single operator to handle all encryption services on the DTT platform but under the amended regulation, new operators will be able to offer encrypted DTT services making it possible for them to launch pay-DTT services.

<doc id="697315" wikidata="Q558661" url="?curid=697315" title="List of rivers of Alabama">
<text>This is a list of rivers of the US state of Alabama. Alabama has over 132,000 miles of rivers and streams with more freshwater biodiversity than any other US state. Alabama&#x27;s rivers are among the most biologically diverse waterways in the world. 38% of North America&#x27;s fish species, 43% of its freshwater gill-breathing snails, 51% of its freshwater turtle species, and 60% of its freshwater mussel species are native to Alabama&#x27;s rivers.

==By drainage basin==
All rivers in Alabama eventually flow into the Gulf of Mexico. This list arranges rivers into drainage basin, which are ordered by the location of the mouth of the main stem from east to west. Tributaries are ordered from mouth to source (subject to being within the borders of Alabama).

<text>Admiral Sir Bertram Home Ramsay, KCB, KBE, MVO (20 January 1883 – 2 January 1945) was a Royal Navy officer. He commanded the destroyer during the First World War. In the Second World War, he was responsible for the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 and planning and commanding the naval forces in the invasion of France in 1944.

==Personal life==
Ramsay was born in Hampton Court Palace, into an old family (see Ramsay Baronets). He attended Colchester Royal Grammar School.

On 26 February 1929, Ramsay married Helen Margaret Menzies, daughter of Colonel Charles Thomson Menzies. They had two sons, 
* David Francis Ramsay (1 October 1933 – 2 January 2021) who wrote two books and had two children, Michael Ramsay and James Ramsay.
* Major General Charles Alexander Ramsay CB OBE (12 October 1936 – 31 December 2017) was educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and rose to become Director General of the Territorial Army and was a member of the Queen&#x27;s Body Guard for Scotland.

==Early naval career==
Ramsay joined the Royal Navy in 1898. As a naval cadet, he was posted to in April 1899. Later serving on HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, he became a midshipman within a year. By the middle of 1902 he was an acting sub-lieutenant, and he was confirmed in this rank on 15 September 1902. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 December 1904.

The 1911 census reveals him serving as Flag Lieutenant to Rear Admiral Douglas Gamble on in the Mediterranean. The ship was captained at the time by Reginald Tyrwhitt.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Ramsay was given his first command, , a small monitor, in August 1915. For two years his ship was part of the Dover Patrol off the Belgian coast. Promoted to commander on 30 June 1916, in October 1917 he took command of another Dover Patrol vessel, the destroyer . On 9 May 1918, his ship took part in the Second Ostend Raid, a follow-up to the Zeebrugge Raid, for which he was mentioned in despatches.

==Between the wars==
In 1935 Ramsay resigned his post as Chief of Staff to Sir Roger Backhouse C-in-C, Home Fleet who had refused to delegate his authority.

==Second World War==
Ramsay retired from the navy in 1938, but was coaxed out of retirement by Winston Churchill one year later to help deal with the Axis threat. Promoted to vice-admiral, he was named Commander-in-Chief, Dover, on 24 August 1939. His duties included overseeing the defence against possible destroyer raids, the protection of cross-Channel military traffic and the denial of the passage through the Straits of Dover by submarines. 

===Operation Dynamo===

As Vice-Admiral Dover, Ramsay was responsible for the Dunkirk evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo. Working from the tunnels beneath Dover Castle, he and his staff worked for nine days straight to rescue troops trapped in France by the German forces. For his success in bringing home 338,226 British and allied soldiers from the mole and beaches of Dunkirk, he was asked to personally report on the operation to King George VI and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

===Defending Dover===
After Operation Dynamo was completed, he was faced with the enormous problems of defending the waters off Dover from the expected German invasion. For nearly two years, he commanded forces striving to maintain control against the Germans, gaining a second Mention in Despatches. Ramsay was in command when the German battleships and together with escorts passed through the Channel in February 1942. Though the British had made plans to deal with this (Operation Fuller), British forces were taken by surprise, and failed in their efforts to stop them.

===Operation Torch===

Ramsay was to be appointed the Naval Force Commander for the invasion of Europe on 29 April 1942, but the invasion was postponed and he was transferred to become deputy naval commander of the Allied invasion of North Africa.

===Operation Husky===

During the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) in July 1943, Ramsay was Naval Commanding Officer, Eastern Task Force, and prepared the amphibious landings.

===Operation Neptune===
Ramsay was reinstated to the Active List on 26 April 1944 and promoted to the rank of admiral on 27 April 1944. He was appointed Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Naval Expeditionary Force for the invasion.

In this, he executed what has been described by historian Correlli Barnett as a &quot;never surpassed masterpiece of planning&quot; — coordinating and commanding a fleet of almost 7,000 vessels to delivering over 160,000 men onto the beaches of Normandy on D-Day alone, with over 875,000 disembarked by the end of June.

He defused a potential conflict between Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the British Sovereign, King George VI, when Churchill informed the King that he intended to observe the D-Day landings from aboard , a cruiser assigned to bombardment duties for the operation. The King, himself a seasoned sailor and a veteran of the Battle of Jutland in the First World War, likewise announced that he would accompany his Prime Minister. The two were at civil loggerheads until meeting with Admiral Ramsay, who flatly refused to take responsibility for the safety of either of them. Ramsay cited the danger to both the King and the Prime Minister, the risks of the planned operational duties of HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, and the fact that both the King and Churchill would be needed at home in case the landings went badly and immediate decisions were required. This settled the matter and both Churchill and King George VI remained ashore on D-Day.

While the port of Antwerp was vital for the Allies after D-Day, Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery postponed the Battle of the Scheldt, and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.

===Death===
On 2 January 1945, Ramsay was killed when his plane crashed on takeoff at Toussus-le-Noble Airport southwest of Paris. He was en route to a conference with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. Ramsay was interred in Saint-Germain-en-Laye New Communal Cemetery. A memorial to all who died in the crash was erected at Toussus-le-Noble in May 1995.

==Awards==
*Mentioned in Despatches – 1918, 1940
*Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) – 1940
*Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE)
*Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO)

*Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit (United States) &quot;For gallant and distinguished service whilst in command of the invasion operations on Normandy&quot;
*Order of Ushakov, First Class (USSR) – 1944

==Legacy==

A statue of Ramsay was erected in November 2000 at Dover Castle, close to where he had planned the Dunkirk evacuation. His name also appears on the Colchester Royal Grammar School war memorial and a portrait hangs in the school. A secondary school in Middlesbrough was named in his honour, but has since been renamed at least twice. 

In February 2020, the Scottish Borders Council announced plans to build a museum at the family home of Admiral Ramsay. &quot;A former garden store will be converted at Bughtrig House in Coldstream to create the museum in his honour,&quot; BBC News reported.

Admiral Ramsay&#x27;s legacy has been remembered by the Royal Navy; they have used his name for the Apprenticeship Centre at in Fareham, the Ramsay Building which was opened by his son in March 2012.

<doc id="697327" wikidata="Q202867" url="?curid=697327" title="Billy Bremner">
<text>William John Bremner (9 December 1942 – 7 December 1997) was a Scottish professional footballer who played for Leeds United, Hull City, and the Scotland national team. He also managed Doncaster Rovers (twice) and Leeds United. Regarded as one of football&#x27;s great midfielders, Bremner combined precision passing skills with tenacious tackling and physical stamina. He played for Leeds United from 1959 to 1976, serving as captain from 1965 through the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, and winning two League Championship medals and one FA Cup-winners medal. In total, he played 773 games for Leeds, scoring 114 goals.

Having been a Scotland Schoolboys international, Bremner went on to play in 54 full internationals for Scotland, scoring three goals. He was the captain of Scotland&#x27;s 1974 FIFA World Cup squad, playing in all three of their games in the tournament. He was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1970, and was included in the &quot;Football League 100 Legends&quot;, published in 1998.

Following a serious bout of pneumonia, Bremner died of a suspected heart attack on 7 December 1997, two days before his 55th birthday. He has since been voted Leeds United&#x27;s greatest player of all time and, in his honour, the club has erected a statue of him outside the south-east corner of its Elland Road stadium.

==Early life==
===Family and education===
Billy Bremner was born in Stirling on 9 December 1942. His parents, John William (&#x27;Pop&#x27;) and Bridget (&#x27;Bess&#x27;), lived in the Raploch district, reputedly a &quot;tough area&quot; in the shadow of Stirling Castle. His father was a storeman working for the Ministry of Defence at its &#x27;Back-O-Hill&#x27; army barracks, located near Raploch.

Bremner, whose childhood nickname was &#x27;Brock&#x27;, attended St Mary&#x27;s Primary School, which was &quot;literally round the corner&quot; from the family&#x27;s home, till he was eleven. He played for the school&#x27;s football team from the age of nine. In 1954, aged eleven, he left St Mary&#x27;s and went to St Modan&#x27;s High School, also near his home, and continued to develop as a footballer. Even as a boy, Bremner exhibited the sort of skill and determination that would become the hallmark of his professional career. He joined a local club called Gowanhill United when he was thirteen and soon earned a place in its under-21 team. Gowanhill&#x27;s home ground was a piece of spare land called Shell Park which was between Raploch and the barracks.

===Scotland Schoolboys===
In November 1957, Bremner was one of two St Modan&#x27;s boys given a trial for the Stirling Schoolboys County team. He was mentioned in a notice that appeared in the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; issue of 15 November 1957. He was selected to play for the county and his performances in those matches led to selection for Scotland Schoolboys. He made his international debut, aged fifteen, against Northern Ireland Schoolboys at Windsor Park on 28 March 1958. The match, played under floodlights, ended in a 2–2 draw.

Bremner played in three more matches for Scotland Schoolboys in the spring of 1958. His second appearance was against Wales Schoolboys at Somerton Park on 4 April, and this also ended 2–2. Next, on 26 April, Bremner made his first of many visits to Wembley Stadium, playing against England Schoolboys, whose team included Terry Venables, Phil Chisnall, and Ronnie Boyce. According to the &quot;Evening News&quot;, there was a crowd of over 90,000. England Schoolboys won 3–1 but Bremner, playing at inside left was praised for his quick through-ball passing and for his &quot;remarkable stamina&quot;. He was interviewed by the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; after the match and surprised the reporter by saying that he wanted to join an English club, because &quot;English football is faster&quot;. Bremner added that, if he didn&#x27;t become a professional footballer, his choice of career would be glazier. Bremner&#x27;s last match for Scotland Schoolboys was on 18 May, a return against England Schoolboys at Ibrox Stadium. It ended in a 2–2 draw and Bremner again received praise for his efforts. The &quot;News Chronicle&quot; said the midfield tussle between Venables and the &quot;wee but tough Willie Bremner was one of the highlights&quot;.

===Trial matches===
After the schoolboy internationals, Bremner received invitations from Arsenal and Chelsea to play in trial matches. They both offered terms and Bremner went back to Scotland while he considered his options. He was then approached by both Celtic and Rangers. He favoured Celtic but agreed to talk to Rangers first. After learning that Bremner was a Catholic, however, Rangers ended their interest. Bremner&#x27;s father then stepped in and told him he should not join either of the two clubs because of their sectarian antipathy. Bremner said later that his father&#x27;s final words on the matter were: &quot;You&#x27;re going to England, and that&#x27;s that&quot;.

In early 1959, soon after his 16th birthday, Bremner was invited to join Leeds United by team manager Bill Lambton. Bremner accepted and joined the Leeds ground staff along with his friend Tommy Henderson, who had also played for Scotland Schoolboys. Lambton had recently signed Don Revie from Sunderland.

==Professional career==
===Leeds United===
====Ground staff to First Division====
Leeds had been promoted from the Second Division in 1955–56, the season in which Jack Charlton became a first team regular, but they had struggled since John Charles left in 1957, and were relegated after the 1959–60 season.

Jack Taylor replaced Bill Lambton as team manager on 1 May 1959. One of Taylor&#x27;s first junior signings was fifteen-year-old Norman Hunter, who arrived at Elland Road in the summer and joined Bremner on the club&#x27;s ground staff. Bremner signed a professional contract with Leeds on 12 December 1959, soon after his seventeenth birthday. Six weeks later, on 23 January 1960, Taylor gave Bremner his first team debut at outside-right in a 3–1 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Bremner played alongside Revie, who was the team&#x27;s inside-right. &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; reporter Phil Brown noted that Bremner showed &quot;enthusiasm, guts, intelligence, most accurate use of the ball and unselfishness&quot; despite poor weather conditions. Regular outside-right Chris Crowe was sold to Blackburn Rovers in March 1960, allowing Bremner to take his place on a permanent basis.

Returning to the Second Division for the 1960–61 season, Leeds were beaten by future rivals Liverpool at Anfield in the opening match, after which Bremner was dropped from the team. He won his place back later in the season after meeting with Jack Taylor to explain his frustration at being left out. In March 1961, with the team in the lower half of the Second Division table, Taylor resigned and Revie took over as player-manager until March 1962 when he retired as a player and became the full-time manager. This was significant for young players like Hunter and Bremner because Revie initiated a youth development policy which was the basis of the club&#x27;s future success. Among others who graduated were Paul Reaney, Peter Lorimer, Terry Cooper, Eddie Gray, and Paul Madeley.

Revie rejected an offer of £25,000 from Hibernian for Bremner, despite the player wanting to return to Scotland to be with his fiancée.

Leeds struggled in the 1961–62 campaign, finishing just three points above the relegation zone, despite 12 goals in 45 appearances from Bremner, who finished as the club&#x27;s joint top-scorer with centre-half Jack Charlton. In March 1962, Revie retired as a player and became the full-time manager. In the same month, Revie signed Bobby Collins from Everton.

Collins helped to create the &quot;win-at-all-costs&quot; attitude that defined Leeds and Bremner throughout the rest of Revie&#x27;s 13 years as manager.

Revie introduced some of the club&#x27;s promising youngsters in the 1962–63 season; Hunter and Reaney made their debuts against Swansea Town at Vetch Field on 8 September 1962, Leeds winning 2–0. Revie&#x27;s policy paid dividends as the team finished fifth, only four points behind promoted Chelsea. Bremner, however, was limited to 24 appearances. He was out of form and was dropped from the first team during the end of season run-in, which included a disproportionately high number of matches that had been postponed during the harsh winter conditions of early 1963.

Revie moved Bremner to central midfield. He bought Johnny Giles from Manchester United. The combination of Bremner and Giles became arguably the most effective midfield partnership of the next twelve years.

With Bremner, Collins, and Giles in midfield, Leeds went on to win promotion as Second Division champions in the 1963–64 season.

The club won no friends in doing so, however, and the following summer were labelled by the Football Association&#x27;s own &quot;FA News&quot; as &quot;the dirtiest [team] in the Football League.

====1964–65====
In November of the 1964–65 season Bremner featured heavily in a win at Everton that was marred by violent clashes on the pitch, the game was stopped for a short spell ten minutes before half-time as the referee felt that a spell of cooling down was needed to prevent further violence; despite the referee only giving 12 Leeds fouls to Everton&#x27;s 19 the match helped to cement United&#x27;s reputation as a dirty and overly physical team.

A run of victories put the club top by the new year. However, they lost the title on goal average to Manchester United after drawing their last game of the season against already-relegated Birmingham City. Leeds faced Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, and the game went to extra time after a 0–0 draw. Bremner scored a half-volley in the 100th minute to cancel out Roger Hunt&#x27;s opener, but Ian St John won the game for Liverpool in the 113th minute.

====1965–66 to 1968–69====
In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins was badly injured in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino. Revie gave the captaincy to Bremner for the remainder of the season after initially offering it to Charlton, who turned it down because he had a superstitious ritual of being last out of the tunnel on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, and the manager had no doubts about Bremner&#x27;s ability to lead the team. Leeds finished second in the 1965–66 league campaign, six points behind Liverpool.

Leeds reached the 1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against Dinamo Zagreb but lost 2–0 on aggregate; Zagreb won 2–0 at the Stadion Maksimir and held Leeds to a 0–0 draw at Elland Road. Leeds enjoyed a double success next season, however, winning both the 1968 Football League Cup Final, against Arsenal at Wembley; and the 1968 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, in which they beat Ferencvárosi 1–0 at Elland Road and held them to a 0–0 draw at the Népstadion to win the club&#x27;s first European trophy.

Revie targeted the title for the 1968–69 campaign and played Bremner in every league game as Leeds finished six points clear at the top to become champions of England for the first time. The title was secured with a 0–0 draw against Leeds&#x27; main rivals Liverpool, at Anfield on 28 April, after which Bremner led the players to applaud the Liverpool fans who responded by chanting &quot;Champions, Champions, Champions&quot;.

====1969 to 1973====
The 1969–70 season opened with victory in the 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront alongside Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to resist the temptation to get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only to give up on the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.

The league title in the 1970–71 season was decided in mid-April in front of the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; cameras at Elland Road, when Leeds lost their lead at the top with defeat by West Bromwich Albion. The Leeds players blamed the referee for costing them the title as offside was not given for Colin Suggett for Jeff Astle&#x27;s winner, and despite Bremner saying &quot;But we fight on. Make no mistake about that, it is not over yet&quot; Leeds could not overtake Arsenal, who went on to win the Double. Success instead came in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as Leeds knocked out Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final with Juventus (Italy). Bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face Liverpool in the semi-finals, and scored the only goal of the two-legged tie with a header at Anfield. Leeds won the final on the away goals rule after recording a 2–2 draw at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino and then a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.

Leeds finished second in the league for the third successive season in the 1971–72 campaign, despite playing some of the best football in the club&#x27;s history. They knocked out Bristol Rovers, Liverpool, Cardiff City, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City to reach the 1972 FA Cup Final with Arsenal; they then won the trophy for the first time in the club&#x27;s history with Allan Clarke scoring the final&#x27;s only goal. Two days after the final Leeds could have secured the Double by winning a point against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, but a 2–1 defeat handed the title to Derby County. On 3 February 1982, Bremner won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after he sued the &quot;Sunday People&quot; newspaper for publishing an article on 11 September 1977 that alleged he tried to fix football matches, including the May 1972 game at Wolves. Bremner donated the damages to a Leeds Hospice.

The title was nowhere near as close in the 1972–73 season, which saw Leeds finish third, seven points behind Liverpool. However more runners-up medals came from the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After Bremner scored the only goal of the semi-final clash with Wolves, Leeds went on to lose the FA Cup final 1–0 to Second Division Sunderland. They were then beaten 1–0 by Italian side A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, though Bremner missed the final due to suspension.

====1973 to 1976====
Revie instructed Bremner to be more attacking in the 1973–74 campaign, and the result was 11 goals in 52 appearances, his biggest goal tally in 12 years. The manager focused entirely on the league and told his team the aim was to go the season unbeaten, and although they lost three games they secured a second league title by a five-point margin on second-place Liverpool. Bremner was named on the PFA Team of the Year and finished second in the FWA Footballer of the Year voting to Ian Callaghan. At the end of the season he was given a testimonial match against Sunderland which raised him £32,500; he had chosen the opponents in an attempt to avenge defeat in the previous year&#x27;s FA Cup final.

Manager Don Revie took the England management job in July 1974. Bremner applied for the vacant Leeds job after Johnny Giles had been named by Revie as his successor, but instead the board surprised everyone by appointing Brian Clough, who went on to a disastrous 44-day spell in charge of Leeds at the start of the 1974–75 season. Revie&#x27;s departure was tough for Bremner, who had a strong bond with his manager. Leeds lost the 1974 FA Charity Shield in a penalty shoot-out to Liverpool, but more significantly Bremner and Kevin Keegan were sent off for fighting and received eleven game suspensions. By the time Bremner was allowed to play again Jimmy Armfield was the manager, though he refuted the accusation that he had attempted to undermine Clough as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Teammate Peter Lorimer insisted that the only criticism he had of Bremner was in applying for the management job against Giles, which had caused to board to look elsewhere for fear of dividing the dressing room by choosing between Bremner and Giles. Results improved with Bremner back in the side, and though they ended the season in ninth place, they were only eight points behind champions Derby. The club&#x27;s biggest aim would be success in the European Cup, and they made it to the final after knocking out FC Zürich (Switzerland), Újpest FC (Hungary), Anderlecht (Belgium), and Barcelona (Spain). Their final opponents at Parc des Princes were defending champions Bayern Munich (Germany), who beat Leeds 2–0; United had a Lorimer goal controversially ruled out for an offside decision against Bremner and the tie ended in rioting by United fans.

With most of the Revie built team retiring or moving on to other clubs, Armfield had to rebuild the squad, though Bremner would still play 38 games in the 1975–76 campaign. However, he missed a lengthy spell in the new year due to injury and results dipped during this time and ultimately ended the club&#x27;s title hopes; they went on to end the campaign in fifth spot.

===Hull City===
Bremner signed with Hull City for a £25,000 fee on 23 September 1976, manager John Kaye feeling that Bremner&#x27;s experience would benefit his youthful Second Division side. His debut at Boothferry Park came against Brian Clough&#x27;s Nottingham Forest, and Bremner was credited with scoring the winning goal of the game with a free-kick, though it seemed to have gone in with a significant deflection. Despite the good start results dipped midway through the 1976–77 season and the &quot;Tigers&quot; ended the season in 14th place. Despite suffering with a back injury Bremner was appointed as captain and played 32 games.

He missed the 1977–78 pre-season with a knee injury, but recovered well enough to make 36 appearances throughout the campaign. Kaye was sacked after a poor start to the season, and was replaced by Bremner&#x27;s former Leeds teammate Bobby Collins, who had joined the club as assistant manager in the summer; as at Leeds, Bremner had applied for the vacant managerial role, but was rejected. After being turned down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player at the end of his contract in June 1978. The season was a disaster, and though Collins was sacked and replaced by youth coach Ken Houghton in February, results did not improve and Hull were relegated in last place, ten points from safety.

==International career==
Bremner was well established in the Scotland set-up, playing in a trial match against the Scottish Football League XI and winning four under-23 caps, before he made his senior debut for Scotland in May 1965, in a 0–0 draw with Spain at Hampden Park. He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in their group, which was not enough to qualify. He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received a black eye from Pelé&#x27;s elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how he had failed to intimidate Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.

The England–Scotland football rivalry was intense throughout his playing career, and so great media attention came upon Bremner and the rest of the Scottish players after they beat world champions England 3–2 at Wembley to become the &quot;unofficial world champions&quot; on 15 April 1967. Many teammates said that Bremner held this match as one of the proudest moments of his career.

Placed in a tough group for qualification to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Scotland failed to qualify after finishing in second place. Bremner captained his country throughout the process, having first taken up the armband in a friendly defeat by Denmark in Copenhagen. He scored his first international goal in a 2–1 qualifying victory over Austria at Hampden Park, his first game as captain. This game was followed by two victories over Cyprus and a 1–1 draw with West Germany, however a 3–2 defeat by West Germany in Hamburg ended their hopes of making it to the World Cup. Bremner&#x27;s second international goal came in a 3–2 win over Wales in a British Home Championship game at the Racecourse Ground.

Scotland were the only home nation to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup after finishing ahead of Czechoslovakia and Denmark in their group. However, Bremner was nearly not selected by manager Willie Ormond after Ormond found him drunk in a bar not long after Jimmy Johnstone had to be rescued by the coastguard having gotten stranded in a rowing boat during a night out following a home international match against Northern Ireland. Having been selected, Bremner captained Scotland to a 2–0 win over Zaire at the Westfalenstadion. He was later accused by Zairian player Ndaye Mulamba of racially abusing him during this match, as well as spitting at Mulamba and Mana Mamuwene. A highly creditable 0–0 draw against world champions Brazil left Scotland with high hopes of qualifying to the second round. Yet a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia sent Scotland out of the competition unbeaten due to Brazil and Yugoslavia finishing level on points but with superior goal difference.

Bremner&#x27;s last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. An incident in Copenhagen after the game where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham also were banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had been blown out of proportion by the SFA.

==Playing style and personality==
Bremner began his Leeds career as a right winger but came into his own after Revie shifted him to a central midfield role. In that position, Bremner became a &quot;fiery midfield dynamo&quot; whose &quot;tireless energy&quot; made him a natural leader on the field, always spurring his team on to greater efforts. In its Hall of Fame dedication to him, the National Football Museum said: &quot;His priceless precision passing, stamina and skill led him to become a Leeds United legend and one of the game&#x27;s greatest midfielders&quot;.

In 2007, a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article described Bremner as &quot;10st of barbed wire&quot; due to his tenacity and tough tackling.

==Management career==
===Doncaster Rovers (1978–1985)===
Bremner was appointed manager of struggling Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in November 1978. He oversaw a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Belle Vue in his first match in charge. Results fluctuated during the 1978–79 season, demonstrated by a 7–1 defeat by struggling AFC Bournemouth punctuating a run of five wins in six games. Rovers ended the season in 22nd place, though 11 points ahead of Halifax Town and Crewe Alexandra, and successfully applied to the Football League for re-election.

He introduced massages and changed the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. With no money available for transfers he was forced to turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker&#x27;s death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.

A disappointing opening sequence of the 1980–81 season was followed by six wins in six games in September, and Bremner won his second Manager of the Month award. The good results continued for the rest of the campaign, and Rovers were promoted in third place. He signed Celtic&#x27;s Colin Douglas for the challenge of Third Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third Division Manager of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed to win in the league. Results again picked up with only two defeats in the last 14 games, and they ended the campaign in 19th spot, three points above the relegation zone.

Strong competition promoted from the Fourth Division – Wigan Athletic, Sheffield United and Bradford City – made the 1982–83 campaign a tough prospect. A weak defence saw an unusual sequence of high-scoring matches early in the season: 6–1 win over Exeter City, 7–5 win over Reading, 6–3 defeat by Wigan, and a 4–4 draw with Brentford. Only seven wins from the last 36 games of the season left Doncaster relegated in 23rd place, 16 points behind 20th-place Orient.

To try and win immediate promotion during the 1983–84 season Bremner signed veteran forward Ernie Moss (who had won three promotions out of the division), Andy Kowalski, left-back John Breckin, experienced defender Bill Green, and young midfielder Mark Miller. Investment by new director Peter Wetzel allowed Bremner to spend £120,000 on three players in March: £60,000 on Stirling Albion defender John Philliben, £25,000 on young Celtic midfielder Jim Dobbin, and £35,000 on Shrewsbury Town defender Alan Brown. Promotion was secured in comfortable fashion, as they finished as runners-up to runaway champions York City, ten points above fifth-place Aldershot.

Building for the 1984–85 campaign, Bremner signed former Leeds striker Aiden Butterworth and winger John Buckley (£25,000 from Partick Thistle). Doncaster won five of their opening seven games, and though they were unable to sustain a promotion push they showed their ability with a 1–0 win over eventual champions Bradford at Valley Parade on Boxing Day and a 1–0 FA Cup win over First Division side Queens Park Rangers on 5 January. Rovers finished the season in 14th place, some distance from the promotion and the relegation places.

To pay for stadium upgrades necessitated by the aftermath of the Bradford City stadium fire Doncaster were forced to sell Ian and Glynn Snodin, who went to Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday and respectively for a total of £315,000. To replace them he bought Dave Rushbury from Gillingham for £10,000 and spent £60,000 on Millwall defender Dave Cusack.

===Leeds United (1985–1988)===
Bremner was appointed as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom with his work at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster £45,000 in compensation. The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular hooligan riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie&#x27;s philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from the starting line eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (£20,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for £60,000, £55,000 and £80,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (£65,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985–86 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place.

During the 1986 close season, Bremner spent £125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and a further £80,000 to bring in 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (£15,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (£35,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986–87 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for £840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for £110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for £72,000 and £200,000 respectively. A 2–1 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3–2 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1–0 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew&#x27;s. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion.

Bremner signed a new three-year contract in the 1987 close season. New arrivals at the club were Glynn Snodin (£150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (£230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (£350,000 from Derby County), as well as Jim Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987–88 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy a good relationship with the club&#x27;s board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988–89 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds went on to win promotion in 1990.

===Doncaster Rovers (1989–1991)===
In July 1989 Bremner went back as manager to Doncaster, who had fallen back into the Fourth Division during his absence. He signed Lincoln City winger John McGinley and Leeds midfielder John Stiles, and led the club to a 20th-place finish in 1989–90, which represented a small improvement on the previous season. Greater success came in the Football League Trophy, Rovers reaching the area finals, where they were beaten by Third Division leaders Tranmere Rovers.

New additions for the 1990–91 campaign were Peterborough United goalkeeper Paul Crichton, Stoke City defender Andy Holmes and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eddie Gormley, as well as his former Leeds captain Brendan Ormsby. Rovers were top of the table at the turn of the year, but injuries and lack of form caused results to fall away, as did hopes of promotion, and Doncaster finished the campaign in 11th place. Rovers started the 1991–92 season badly and Bremner tendered his resignation on 2 November, with the club sitting bottom of the Football League.

==Personal life and later years==
===Family and post-football activity===
Bremner married Vicky Dick in November 1961. He had a ghost-written column in &quot;Shoot&quot; throughout the 1970s. After retiring from football in November 1991 he took up work as an after dinner speaker.

===Illness and death===

At the beginning of December 1997, Bremner was rushed to hospital after suffering from pneumonia, but suffered a suspected heart attack at his Doncaster home in the small village of Clifton and died. His funeral, attended by many of Bremner&#x27;s former team-mates and other football players and coaches, was held four days later in the Yorkshire village of New Edlington. A statue by sculptor Frances Segelman of Bremner in celebratory pose was erected outside Elland Road in tribute in 1999.

===Awards===
In 1988, the Football League, as part of its centenary season celebrations, included Bremner on its list of 100 League Legends. He was inducted into both the English Football Hall of Fame and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame in 2004, with the acknowledgement that: &quot;his priceless precision passing, stamina and skill led him to become a Leeds United legend and one of the game&#x27;s greatest midfielders&quot; and that he &quot;was not simply tough but a skilful player with an ability to score in crucial games&quot;. In 2006, he was voted Leeds United&#x27;s greatest player of all time. In September 2013 he was voted as the greatest captain in the Football League&#x27;s history.

===&quot;The Damned United&quot;===
Bremner was portrayed by Stephen Graham in the 2009 biographical drama film &quot;The Damned United&quot;, directed by Tom Hooper and starring Michael Sheen as Brian Clough.

<text>Michael John Giles (born 6 November 1940) is an Irish former association football player and manager best remembered for his time as a midfielder with Leeds United in the 1960s and 1970s. After retiring from management in 1985, Giles served as the senior analyst on RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of association football from 1986 until 2016. The FAI voted Giles as the greatest Irish player of the last 50 years at the UEFA Jubilee Awards in 2004.

After winning an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal under Matt Busby at Manchester United, Giles moved to Leeds in 1963 where he played in midfield alongside captain Billy Bremner. The duo formed a central midfield partnership which was one of the best in English and European club football. Their pairing helped yield several major trophies in the most successful era in Leeds&#x27; history. Giles and Bremner both scored 115 goals for the club.

In his later years in football, Giles pursued a managerial career which saw him installed as player-manager and manager of, among others, West Bromwich Albion, the Republic of Ireland, Vancouver Whitecaps and Shamrock Rovers. Despite having an outstanding knowledge of the game, Giles personally never liked being a manager. He became disillusioned with aspects of the job, such as suffering at the hands of non-committal boardrooms, and left management permanently in 1985. He later declared that he had no regrets about quitting managerial life.

After repeated encouragement from childhood friend Eamon Dunphy, Giles inadvertently entered the world of football punditry in 1986 and became a senior analyst on RTÉ Sport until 2016. In December 2019, he was employed as an analyst for Premier Sports&#x27; live coverage of the English Premier League matches. Also, he writes two columns per week for the Irish &quot;Evening Herald&quot; newspaper, and offers his opinions about the game on radio station Newstalk 106.

==Club career==
Giles grew up in Ormond Square, a working class area of inner-city Dublin, where he developed many of the skills that would aid him in becoming a professional footballer. He was encouraged to enter the game through his father Christy who played for Bohemians in the 1920s and managed Drumcondra during the 1940s.

Growing up, Giles remarked &quot;I didn&#x27;t consider myself Irish&quot;. This was due to the outsider status of association footballers in the mainstream sports-life of the Republic, where Gaelic Games were a much more dominant force in the &#x27;50s of his youth.

Giles was spotted in Dublin playing for Stella Maris, before he began his English career with Manchester United. He joined Matt Busby&#x27;s team for a £10 signing-on fee in 1956. He was given an early first-team debut in 1959 after eight of the team died in the Munich air disaster in February of the previous year. Among the dead was Bill Whelan, who was five years older than Giles and also came from the Cabra district of Dublin.

He was also chosen to play for the Republic of Ireland team by the age of 18.

Giles was a regular first-team player over the next four years, playing alongside Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1963, where Giles played the defence-splitting pass which started the move towards a winning goal by David Herd.

After being out of favour, he asked for a transfer and joined Leeds United for £33,000. &quot;I am going to haunt him&quot;, is what Giles said of Busby, to his wife Anne, after the Scotsman had forced his departure when freezing him out of the starting team.

Giles would soon evolve into one of the finest central midfielders in England, as Leeds won the Second Division title in his first season there. In 1965, he was in the team which came close to a League championship and FA Cup &quot;double&quot; but missed out on both, to Manchester United and to Liverpool respectively.

Giles formed a strong partnership with Billy Bremner as Leeds manager Don Revie built a new team around them. The players had similarities in their styles and were a tremendous foil for one another. Giles was known as the creative force and Bremner as the ball-winner, but each was capable of doing the other&#x27;s primary job.

In the 1967–68 season Leeds won both the League Cup and the Fairs Cup. That was the first season in which Giles was affected by injury, which meant he missed the second leg of the Fairs Cup final. In the 1968–69 season, Giles was instrumental in Leeds becoming league champions in a then record 67 points from 42 matches at 2 points for a win, a record that stood for ten seasons. In 1970, Giles again had a magnificent season as Leeds chased three trophies but lost all three, the League went to Everton; the FA Cup to Chelsea after a replay; and the European Cup campaign ended at the hands of Celtic in the semi-finals.

In the fifth round of the 1971 FA Cup, when Leeds were unexpectedly beaten 3–2 by Colchester United, Giles scored Leeds&#x27; second goal as they almost came back from 3–0 down. Leeds regained the Fairs Cup but lost the League title on the last day, with Arsenal getting the victory they needed to earn the championship and form one half of a successful &quot;double&quot; bid.

Leeds won their first FA Cup and Giles his second when they defeated Arsenal 1–0 at Wembley in 1972, yet again they missed out on the League on the final day of the season after defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Sunderland and A.C. Milan beat Leeds in the finals of the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup in 1973, rendering Leeds trophyless again. Jack Charlton&#x27;s retirement in 1973 also left Giles as the most senior member of the squad. In the same year, he started to combine his Leeds duties with a spell as player-manager of his country.

In 1974, a 29-match unbeaten run at the start of the season helped Leeds coast to their second title, but then controversy reigned after Revie quit to take over the England team. Revie recommended to the Leeds board of directors that Giles, nearly 34 and approaching the end of his playing career, should be his successor. The board instead appointed Brian Clough, a brilliant manager but a controversial choice as he had been publicly critical of Leeds in the past and was not an admirer of Revie. Clough and the players never got on – the players had wanted Giles too – and the board reacted by dismissing Clough with a big pay-off after just 44 days in charge. Giles still did not get the job though (that went to Jimmy Armfield) and concentrated on playing as Leeds chased a place in their first European Cup final. Giles himself never applied for the Leeds vacancy on those two occasions, his name had instead been put forward as a candidate by others. Also in 1974, Giles was nominated—along with Danny Blanchflower—by Bill Nicholson as his successor at Tottenham Hotspur. The Spurs board appointed Terry Neill instead.

Giles was outstanding in Leeds&#x27; European campaign but was no longer an automatic fixture in the side. After appearing in the 1975 final, which Leeds lost 2–0 to Bayern Munich, Giles accepted an offer in June 1975 from West Bromwich Albion to become their player-manager, while still playing for and managing the Irish team.

==Status within the game==
Giles is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers to have come out of the Republic of Ireland. High tributes have been conferred on Giles by hugely successful former managers such as Alf Ramsey, Matt Busby and Brian Clough. His status at Leeds United was noted when supporters there named him in the greatest Leeds XI of all time. His place in English football history was recognised in 1998 when the Football League, as part of its centenary celebrations, listed Giles on its list of 100 League legends. When Giles was quizzed as to the differences between himself and another highly regarded former Irish player, Roy Keane, he said: &quot;If forced to compare us, I&#x27;d say I was slightly more creative than him and he [Keane] was a better ball-winner.&quot;

==Reputation as a hard player==
In the early part of his career, Giles endured some rough treatment. This occurred when he suffered a career-threatening ankle injury at the hands of Birmingham City&#x27;s Johnny Watts, and knee ligament damage sustained when tackled by Eddie McCreadie at Stamford Bridge. Being a creative and diminutive figure, Giles thereafter accepted he would have to become a tougher player in order to avoid being singled out by opponents. On later becoming a pundit, Giles at length wrote about how he felt he had to become &quot;a lion rather than a lamb&quot; on the pitch so as to help achieve his full potential. His primary reason for this was to avoid being labelled a hypocrite when the time came for him to give judgement on tough tackling by others.

==Player-manager career==
Giles showed much promise as a young player-manager of the Republic of Ireland, as he combined his duties in charge of West Brom, where after a slow start, he won the majority of Baggies supporters over. Under his leadership, they were promoted from the Second Division in April 1976, and finished 7th in the First Division in 1976–77. He recently said the time he spent at West Brom was amongst the happiest of his career despite him not winning trophies there. However, his spell at the club also witnessed several clashes with the club&#x27;s board over the financial running of the club, an area that Giles felt the board excluded him from too much. Giles even tendered his resignation over the matter on the day promotion was secured, although he was persuaded to change his mind and oversee the First Division campaign. He resigned as player-manager at West Brom on 21 April 1977, the very same day as his former team-mate Jack Charlton resigned his managerial post at Middlesbrough, and moved back to Ireland to manage Shamrock Rovers until 1983.

He returned to the Hawthorns for a second spell as manager during the 1983–84 season, steering the side to safety despite losing his first game in charge 1–0 to Third Division Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup. The following season saw Albion start well and they were as high as 5th at Christmas, but finished 12th. However Giles&#x27; decision to sell fan favourite Cyrille Regis and top scorer Garry Thompson led to supporter disgruntlement, with the replacements Giles signed - Garth Crooks and Imre Varadi - proving unsuccessful. He resigned as manager in October 1985 following a 3–0 defeat at Coventry City, a record ninth consecutive defeat for Albion. Youth team manager Nobby Stiles, who was also Giles&#x27; brother-in-law, replaced him although, despite a slight improvement in results, the club could not climb off the foot of the table and, under Ron Saunders, finished in bottom place.

==Managing career==

===Republic of Ireland===
As player-manager of the Republic of Ireland between 1973 and 1980, Giles oversaw a revival in the fortunes of the national side which had struggled for the previous decade. The 1976 European Championship qualifiers saw the international debut of Liam Brady and a more respectable showing. In the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the side finished only two points short of qualification, defeating France at home during that campaign.

===Shamrock Rovers===
During his five-and-a-half-year spell in charge at Glenmalure Park Rovers won the FAI Cup in 1978, he scored 2 goals in 4 appearances in the European Cup Winners Cup and captained Ireland nine times, scoring once. Giles played his last game on 14 December 1980 at Milltown, he was 40 years of age.

He resigned at Milltown on 3 February 1983, after having left his Ireland job in March 1980, and ventured across the Atlantic for spells in charge of clubs in the North American Soccer League. In 1981, he was hired to coach the Vancouver Whitecaps of the NASL. He held that position for three seasons, being named the 1982 North American Soccer League Coach of the Year.

==Media career==

Giles later returned to Ireland and settled into a much-admired career in journalism and started out as a pundit on Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) in November 1986. He featured on &quot;Premier Soccer Saturday&quot; and its international and European soccer coverage, particularly their coverage of games involving the Republic of Ireland national football team. Giles contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 World Cup where prior to it starting he correctly predicted Spain would win the tournament. He is currently the leading soccer analyst on Newstalk.

Of the English Premier League, Giles is often critical of the methods of modern coaching, and in particular, younger managers, saying in 2016:

When you hear the younger managers talking, it&#x27;s all about tactics now. If their players are not playing well, they change the formation. There&#x27;s nothing about not passing the ball to each other or misplacing passes. It&#x27;s all about, well the tactics were wrong. I&#x27;ve seen it so often, you hear it on the television as well. Their team is playing very poorly, they&#x27;re 2–0 down at half-time, they&#x27;re giving the ball away, kicking it out of play. Well what do you have to do, and they start talking about changing the formation. No matter what formation you play you have to pass the ball to each other.

He was also part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s studio coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Giles left RTÉ Sport after UEFA Euro 2016 after 30 years with the broadcaster, his last appearance was on the night of the Euro 2016 final.

==Retirement==
Giles resides in the Harborne area of the city of Birmingham in England. He has played golf for many years, and at one time, played off a handicap of five, but with his advancing age his handicap has risen to 12, &quot;a bad 12&quot; he claims. To coincide with his 70th birthday, Giles compiled a first-ever autobiography chronicling his life in and outside of football which was released in November 2010. In 2010, his autobiography, titled &quot;A Football Man&quot;, became the best selling book in the Republic of Ireland. In it, he claims to be an admirer of cricket where he attended the occasional game in his spare time as a footballer.

==Media portrayals and successful legal action==
Giles was portrayed by actor Peter McDonald in the 2009 film &quot;The Damned United&quot;, which centred on Brian Clough&#x27;s ill-fated 44-day spell as Leeds United manager in 1974. Giles successfully sued the author of the book, David Peace, who printed the work in 2006, from which the film was made. He said of Peace: &quot;His book was outrageous. I&#x27;m portrayed as the scheming leprechaun. He [Peace] had me in conversations with Clough that never happened. It made Clough out to be a wild man whereas he wasn&#x27;t drinking then. I didn&#x27;t get on with him but I found him highly intelligent. Peace said the novel was fiction based on fact, trouble is, people assume it&#x27;s the official version. The movie was a misinterpretation of the misinterpretation that was the book!&quot;

In another interview in relation to his taking court action, Giles said: &quot;I took my stand because I was the only one alive who could do anything about it. The Clough family had no comeback. They couldn&#x27;t do anything as Brian was dead, that was a huge influence (on taking the legal action).&quot;

As part of the settlement in the 2008 High Court dispute, the publisher of the book, Faber and Faber, was ordered to remove from any future editions the references perceived by Giles as damaging and untrue.

==Family==
In 1966, Giles married Anne, sister of Irish Olympic sprinter Paul Dolan, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. Two of his sons, Michael and Chris, played for Shamrock Rovers; Michael from 1981 to 1983 and Chris from 1993 to 1995. Giles&#x27; father, Christy Giles, played for Bohemians in the 1920s and won a league title in his first season at Dalymount Park. His uncle Chris Giles (Irish footballer) also played for Ireland. Giles is a brother-in-law of Nobby Stiles, his former Manchester United team-mate, who married into the Giles family. His uncle Matt managed Transport to FAI Cup success in 1950.

==John Giles Foundation==
In 2008, the Football Association of Ireland founded a non-profit trust to fund grassroots clubs and football at youth level. Giles, who had previously hosted charity golf events to raise money for good causes, allowed the FAI the right to use his image for the charitable organisation, thus giving rise to the John Giles Foundation. This would involve grassroots clubs taking part in sponsored walks called the &quot;Walk of Dreams&quot;, whereby half the money raised by each club would go to the club themselves, and the other half going to clubs selected by the foundation.

The inaugural event in 2011 was met with negative criticism, as the main walk ending at the Aviva Stadium was marred by inadequate toilet facilities at the stadium endpoint, along with expensively-priced food, a lack of bottled water and the absence of Republic of Ireland senior international footballers, whose attendance at the event had been promised, all of which went on to be discussed on RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Liveline&quot; programme.

While the John Giles Foundation raised some €700,000 for its causes during its lifetime, it emerged in 2019 that the FAI, under the stewardship of John Delaney had paid over €500,000 to former footballer Con Martin jnr, for the concept of the foundation, the fundraising walks and a kit-purchasing idea, payments of which were unknown to Giles at the time.

In September 2022, the FAI announced the winding down of the John Giles Foundation, with a final donation of €55,000 being made to the FAI&#x27;s Football For All schools programme.

<text>Norman Hunter (29 October 1943 – 17 April 2020) was an English professional footballer who played for Leeds United, Bristol City, Barnsley and the England national team. He also managed Barnsley and Rotherham United. A tough tackling centre-back and defensive midfielder, he won two League Championship medals and one FA Cup-winners medal with Leeds, for whom he played 726 games in total, scoring 21 goals.

Hunter played in 28 full internationals for England, scoring twice. He was a member of England&#x27;s 1966 FIFA World Cup winning squad but, as understudy to Bobby Moore, he did not play in the tournament. He was the first winner of the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award in 1974, and was included in the &quot;Football League 100 Legends&quot;, published in 1998.

An early victim of COVID-19 when the pandemic began in 2020, Hunter was admitted to hospital on 10 April after testing positive. He died of the disease a week later, aged 76. On 23 April, Leeds United announced that the South Stand at its Elland Road stadium would be renamed the Norman Hunter South Stand in his honour.

==Early life==
Norman Hunter was born on 29 October 1943 at Eighton Banks, County Durham. His father, Norman senior, died before he was born. Hunter and his brother Robert were brought up by their mother, Betty, with the help of her sister and two football-playing uncles. He attended Eighton Banks Primary School till he was eleven and then went to Birtley Secondary Modern School till he was 15. He played junior football throughout his school years and, in his autobiography, recalled how one teacher tried to make him become a right-footed player. However, another teacher realised that Hunter had real potential as a left-footed player and encouraged him to develop his natural game. He joined Birtley Juniors FC and had played in only a few games before he was spotted by a talent scout working for Leeds United. After playing in a trial match for Leeds United Juniors against Bradford Park Avenue Juniors, Hunter was invited to join the ground staff at Elland Road. He had just left school and gave up a job as an electrical fitter to pursue his football career.

==Playing career==
===Leeds United===
====Ground staff to First Division====
Leeds were in the First Division when Hunter arrived at Elland Road in the summer of 1959. The team manager was Jack Taylor, who had taken over from Bill Lambton on 1 May 1959. Lambton had signed Don Revie from Sunderland in November 1958 and Billy Bremner, a Scottish Schoolboys international, soon afterwards.

Leeds had been promoted from the Second Division in 1955–56, the season in which Jack Charlton became a first team regular, but they had struggled since John Charles left in May 1957, and were relegated after the 1959–60 season. In March 1961, with the team in the lower half of the Second Division table, Taylor resigned and Revie took over as player-manager until March 1962 when he retired as a player and became the full-time manager. This was significant for young players like Hunter and Bremner because Revie initiated a youth development policy which was the basis of the club&#x27;s future success. Among those who graduated were Paul Reaney, Peter Lorimer, Terry Cooper, Eddie Gray, and Paul Madeley.
Hunter&#x27;s graduation was in the 1962–63 season when Revie promoted him to the first team. He and Paul Reaney made their debuts in a Second Division match against Swansea Town at Vetch Field on 8 September 1962, Leeds winning 2–0. Hunter formed a central defence partnership with Jack Charlton which lasted for over a decade. Leeds finished fifth in 1962–63, Hunter playing in 36 of their 42 matches, and then won the Second Division title in 1963–64, Hunter playing in all 42 matches. Leeds returned to the First Division where, for the rest of Hunter&#x27;s career with them, they were one of the strongest and most competitive teams in both English and European football. Hunter was a consistent performer, playing in over forty matches per season from 1962–63 to 1974–75; and was an ever-present in five seasons.

====1964–65====
Hunter made an immediate impact on the First Division in 1964–65 and, only two months into the season on 28 October 1964 (the day before his 21st birthday), he was selected to play for the Football League XI against the Irish League XI in Belfast. The Football League XI won 4–0. A week later, he made his debut for the England under-23 (u-23) team against Wales u-23 on the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. His Leeds team-mate, goalkeeper Gary Sprake, was playing for Wales u-23. England won 3–2.

Although they were newly promoted, Leeds had an exceptional season in 1964–65 and performed a &quot;runners-up double&quot; by finishing second in the league to Manchester United on goal average; and losing 2–1, after extra time, to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final. Hunter made 51 appearances for Leeds in all competitions, missing only one league match. He also played in three matches for the England u-23s and two for the Football League XI.

====1965–66====
Leeds began the 1965–66 season with a home match against Sunderland on 21 August 1965. They did not play well and struggled to break the Sunderland defence, even after George Mulhall was sent off in the second half. Four minutes from time, the ball ran loose in the Sunderland penalty area and Hunter, running forward in support, met it near the penalty spot and volleyed home to give Leeds a 1–0 win.

Hunter continued to play a key role in the Leeds defence and his form impressed England manager Alf Ramsey, who included him in the squad for a match against Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid on 8 December 1965. Hunter was a substitute and he replaced Joe Baker in the 43rd minute, thereby making his full international debut. He played as a defensive midfielder and that allowed Ramsey to deploy both Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball in more attacking roles as England won 2–0.

Leeds did well in the league again and were runners-up to Liverpool, albeit six points adrift. They gained 55 points from their 42 matches, the same as Burnley with Leeds having the better goal average. Hunter played in 41 of the 42 League matches and scored five goals, his highest total in a single season. Leeds had less success in the two domestic cup competitions, losing 4–2 at home to West Bromwich Albion in the third round of the League Cup (West Brom went on to win the tournament); and losing 1–0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Leeds had qualified for the 1965–66 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and progressed to the semi-finals with Hunter an ever-present in their eleven matches. They had victories over Torino (2–1 on aggregate), SC Leipzig (2–1), Valencia (2–1), and Újpesti Dózsa (5–2). In the semi-final, they drew 2–2 on aggregate with Real Zaragoza but lost the replay 3–1.

====1966 to 1973====

Hunter was a key player for Leeds throughout this period as they became one of the strongest teams in Europe by reaching five European finals while he played for them. They qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup again in 1966–67 and this time reached the two-leg final against Dinamo Zagreb. Hunter played in both matches but Leeds lost 2–0 on aggregate.

Leeds won both the Football League Cup and the Fairs Cup in 1967–68. In the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium, they met Arsenal and won the match with a goal scored by Terry Cooper after 20 minutes. The match was reported as a &quot;poor do&quot;, and as a &quot;a drab and dull game for the neutrals&quot;, but it was one in which Hunter excelled as he and Cooper were rated its best players. Hunter&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;distinguished&quot;.

In the 1967–68 Fairs Cup, Leeds reached the final following successive wins against Scotland&#x27;s Hibernian, Rangers, and Dundee. The two-legged final was against Hungary&#x27;s Ferencváros, who were rated a &quot;crack outfit&quot; and &quot;probably [Leeds&#x27;] biggest test yet&quot;. They had defeated Liverpool &quot;en route&quot; to the final. In the first leg at Elland Road, Ferencváros played a defensive game and their coach said before the match that &quot;a draw will suit us in Leeds&quot;. Hunter came close to scoring early on but Leeds struggled to capitalise on their attacking opportunities. Mick Jones scored the only goal of the match in the 41st minute. Leeds were not expected to win the second leg in Budapest. The match was played only three weeks after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and, as Hungarian forces had been involved, there were concerns that the match might be cancelled. Ferencváros had to play their normal attacking game in this match and the Leeds defence, including Hunter, faced &quot;its sternest test yet&quot;. They held on and the match was goalless, so Leeds won their first European trophy.

Leeds won the League Championship for the first time in 1969, finishing six points ahead of Liverpool and losing only twice. Hunter played in all 42 league matches. In 1970–71, Leeds won the Fairs Cup again, defeating Juventus on the away goals rule in the two-leg final. The aggregate score was 3–3 after the teams drew 2–2 in Turin and 1–1 at Elland Road. Hunter and Jack Charlton were outstanding for Leeds in the first leg, in which they had to contain Helmut Haller, Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and Pietro Anastasi, who at the time was the world&#x27;s most expensive footballer. In his report of the Elland Road match, Phil Brown of the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; wrote:
Before the 1972 FA Cup final at Wembley, some Leeds fans displayed a banner reading &#x27;Norman Bites Yer Legs&#x27; and, after ITV had screened it several times, Hunter was thereafter nicknamed &quot;Bites Yer Legs&quot;. He eventually met the fans who created the banner and &quot;had a laugh about it&quot;. He remarked that there had been jokes about the banner ever since, such as his wife saying: &quot;Norman&#x27;s come home today with a damaged leg&quot;; and the response: &quot;Oh, yes, who does it belong to?&quot;
In Hunter&#x27;s autobiography, he remarked on the disappointment of having been on the losing side in an FA Cup final and was determined that Leeds would win the 1972 final, commenting that he was &quot;really wound up for it&quot;. They defeated Arsenal 1–0 with a goal by Allan Clarke and there is a photograph of Hunter leaping into the air to celebrate the goal being scored. At the end of the game, Hunter climbed the steps to the Royal box twice; once to collect his own medal, and then again to help Mick Jones negotiate his way up and down, as Jones had been receiving treatment for a dislocated elbow while his teammates had been getting their prizes.

In May 1973, Hunter was on the losing team in two finals. In the FA Cup final at Wembley, Leeds surprisingly lost 1–0 to Sunderland, who were then in the Second Division. A few days later, Leeds were defeated 1–0 by AC Milan in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki. Hunter was sent off for retaliation and the game was over-shadowed by rumours of match-fixing.

====1973 to 1976====
In the 1973–74 season, Leeds were unbeaten in their first 29 matches, an achievement that enabled them to hold off a strong Liverpool challenge and win the League Championship, giving Hunter his second League winners medal. On 20 October, having played his 600th match for Leeds, he was presented with a silver salver before the home match against Liverpool. Both teams formed a guard of honour. Hunter then produced a performance described as &quot;quite splendid&quot; to help Leeds defeat their closest rivals 1–0, the goal scored by Mick Jones. At the end of the season, Hunter was the first winner of the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award.

As champions, Leeds entered the European Cup the following season, and Hunter was a member of the team that reached the 1975 European Cup final but lost 2–0 to Bayern Munich.

Towards the end of his career with Leeds, Hunter was in their team for a league match against Derby County at the Baseball Ground on 1 November 1975. Derby won the match 3–2 but it is remembered for a fistfight between Hunter and Derby&#x27;s Francis Lee. Hunter was outraged when Lee won a first half penalty by allegedly taking a dive to fool the referee into thinking Hunter had fouled him. Charlie George scored the penalty to give Derby a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Hunter deliberately provoked Lee with a late tackle. Lee retaliated and Hunter punched him in the mouth, causing a lip injury that needed stitches. The referee sent both players off but Lee attacked Hunter again as they walked towards the touchline. Hunter was knocked down and several players and officials were needed to stop the fight which was shown on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; that night. In 2003, the incident was selected by &quot;The Observer&quot; as &#x27;sport&#x27;s most spectacular dismissal&#x27;.

===Bristol City===
Having made 540 Football League appearances for Leeds, and 726 in all competitions, Hunter signed for Bristol City on 28 October 1976 for £40,000. City had just been promoted back to the First Division after an absence of 65 years. Hunter played in 108 league matches for them till the end of the 1978–79 season. He scored four goals and was the club&#x27;s player of the season in both 1976–77 and 1977–78. In Hunter&#x27;s three seasons, City finished 19th, 17th, and 13th in the First Division. They won only two of eight English cup ties, but they did win the 1977–78 Anglo-Scottish Cup, beating St Mirren 3–2 in the final.

===Barnsley===
Hunter finished his playing career at Barnsley, who had just been promoted from the Fourth Division to the Third when he joined them in June 1979. Barnsley&#x27;s manager was Allan Clarke, one of Hunter&#x27;s former Leeds team-mates. Hunter made 24 league appearances in 1979–80 and Barnsley finished 11th. Returning to Leeds, Clarke departed at the end of the season and Hunter replaced him as team manager, initially as a player-manager. He played in just six matches in 1980–81 and led Barnsley to promotion as Division Three runners-up. Hunter then retired from playing to concentrate on management, but he did make one additional league appearance in 1982–83 because of an injury crisis.

==International career==

Hunter played three games for the England under-23 team before he was given his debut for the England team. On 8 December 1965, England played Spain in Madrid, and Hunter made his debut after coming on as a substitute.

The established partnership between Jack Charlton and Bobby Moore meant that Hunter spent much of his international career as an understudy to Moore; he won 28 caps in total. He was in the squad which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup but did not play in any of the matches.

Hunter scored the winning goal against Spain in England&#x27;s quarter-final qualifying round for the 1968 European Championship, he then started in both the 1–0 semi final defeat to Yugoslavia and the 2–0 victory over the Soviet Union in the bronze medal match. He spent a short part of the 1970 season injured but he was in Alf Ramsey&#x27;s squad for the summer&#x27;s World Cup in Mexico, however his only appearance in the tournament was coming on as a late substitute in the 3–2 defeat by West Germany.

In 1973, Hunter was in the England team which needed to win their last qualifying tie for the 1974 World Cup in West Germany. The opposition at Wembley were Poland, who just needed a draw to qualify at England&#x27;s expense. It was 0–0 when Hunter went to make a tackle, but instead trod on the ball and lost it. Poland quickly made a counter-attack allowing Grzegorz Lato to run clear and set up Jan Domarski to score. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty but England could not score again, and the 1–1 draw saw them miss out on a place at the World Cup.

In addition to his international appearances, Hunter played for The Football League XI six times. In these matches, from October 1964 to September 1969, he played against similar teams representing Ireland (3), Scotland (2) and Belgium. The Football League won all three of the matches against the Irish League; drew 2–2 with the Belgian League; and drew one and lost one against the Scottish League. On 11 June 1967, he travelled to Montreal with the Football Association XI to play in an exhibition match against Borussia Dortmund as part of an Expo International Tournament. The FA XI won 3–2 and Hunter scored the winning goal.

==Playing style and personality==

As Don Revie explained at some length in a tribute to Hunter for his 1974–75 testimonial at Leeds, Hunter&#x27;s job was to win the ball and move it forward. Revie pointed out that Hunter could read the game so that he was invariably well-positioned, and would win the ball by performing committed and uncompromising tackles when necessary. Aware that Hunter was widely perceived to be a physical player only, Revie emphasised that Hunter had good ball control and his passing was accurate, so he was actually a very skilful player.

Like his contemporaries Tommy &quot;Anfield Iron&quot; Smith of Liverpool, Nobby Stiles of Manchester United and Ron &quot;Chopper&quot; Harris of Chelsea, Hunter always had the reputation of being a hard man on the field. However, he said in his autobiography that, of the four, only Smith was &quot;naturally tough&quot; – Harris, Stiles and Hunter himself were all, he said, &quot;laid back off the field&quot;. (Hunter and Smith were close friends.)

When Hunter died, his long-time Leeds team-mate Eddie Gray directed attention to his skill as a player by saying:

Revie described Hunter as &quot;the most honest person I&#x27;ve ever met&quot; and also pointed out the warmth of his personality. Revie remarked on the level of Hunter&#x27;s competitive spirit in any type of sport or game, not just football. Hunter, he said, &quot;only plays one way – to win&quot;.

==Management and coaching==
===Manager of Barnsley===
Hunter was appointed Barnsley manager on 16 September 1980 after Allan Clarke left to take over as manager of Leeds United. Initially a player-manager, Hunter achieved promotion to the Second Division in his debut season, 1980–81, after Barnsley finished second. The team did well in 1981–82, finishing in sixth place and only four points shy of promotion. They had a fine run of success in the 1981–82 Football League Cup and reached the quarter-finals after a 1–0 home win against Manchester City. In that round, they were drawn away to Liverpool and produced a surprise result by drawing 0–0 against the European champions at Anfield. The tie went to a replay at Oakwell where Barnsley scored first, through Colin Walker after 21 minutes. Their hopes of glory were dashed, however, as Graeme Souness equalised before half-time and then Liverpool scored twice in the last ten minutes, with goals by David Johnson and Kenny Dalglish, to win 1–3 (Liverpool went on to win the competition).

Barnsley did less well in 1982–83, but still finished a creditable tenth in the Second Division. In 1983–84, they struggled to avoid relegation and Hunter was sacked on 8 February 1984 after a 3–2 home defeat by Cardiff City. Barnsley did not forget Hunter&#x27;s promotion season and, following his death in 2020, he was inducted into the club&#x27;s Oakwell Hall of Fame; Clarke was inducted on the same day.

===Manager of Rotherham United===
Hunter&#x27;s next job was as a coach at West Bromwich Albion for part of the 1984–85 season. The manager there was Johnny Giles, another of his former Leeds team-mates. However, Hunter was fully settled in Yorkshire and found the travel to and from Birmingham too much, so he resigned.

He was appointed manager of Third Division Rotherham United on 24 June 1985. Rotherham, known as the &#x27;Millers&#x27;, had finished twelfth in 1984–85. They hoped that Hunter could lead a push for promotion in 1985–86, but the team were not up to the task and finished 14th. They had a good run in the FA Cup with big home wins in the first two rounds against Wolves (6–0) and Burnley (4–1). In the third round, they were drawn away against non-league Frickley Athletic and won 3–1, but the run ended in the fourth round with a trip to Arsenal where they were beaten 5–1.

Rotherham did not improve in 1986–87 and again finished 14th. They lost to Chester City in the first round of the FA Cup. Things got much worse in 1987–88. Rotherham struggled from the start of the season and, at the beginning of December, were in the relegation zone. Then, on 6 December, the &#x27;Millers&#x27; had one of the worst defeats in their history when they were beaten 4–0 by non-league Macclesfield Town in the second round of the FA Cup. Three days later, Hunter was sacked.

Hunter said that going to Bristol City was one of his best decisions, but going to Rotherham was the worst. For much of his time there, he had only nine professionals and, when he did buy a few players, the board sold them on. His two years at Rotherham were, he said, &quot;the least enjoyable of my entire football career&quot;.

===Coach at Leeds and Bradford===
In 1988, Hunter was employed as a coach at Leeds under Billy Bremner, but he was dismissed upon the appointment of Howard Wilkinson as manager on 10 October that year. His final job in football was as first team coach to Terry Yorath at Bradford City from 13 March 1989 but was sacked on 19 February 1990.

==Personal life and later years==
===Family and post-football activity===
On 11 June 1968, Hunter married Sue Harper and the couple had two children, Michael and Claire. After leaving Bradford City, Hunter turned to the after-dinner circuit recounting his anecdotes and, from 1993 to 2020, he worked for local stations BBC Radio Leeds and Yorkshire Radio as a match summariser. Hunter retained close links with Leeds United and its fans. He regularly attended Leeds matches and participated in club-hosted conferences and events; the eponymous &quot;Norman Hunter Suite&quot; is located in the West Stand at Elland Road.

===Awards===
In 1998, the Football League, as part of its centenary season celebrations, included Hunter in its list of 100 League Legends. He released his autobiography, &quot;Biting Talk&quot;, in 2004. In November 2007, following a campaign led by The FA, members of England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup squad who did not play in the final, including Hunter, were belatedly awarded winner&#x27;s medals by FIFA. Hunter was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown during a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009.

===&quot;The Damned United&quot;===
In March 2009, Tom Hooper&#x27;s film &quot;The Damned United&quot; was released. Based on David Peace&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;The Damned Utd&quot;, it dramatised Brian Clough&#x27;s ill-fated 44 days as manager of Leeds United in 1974. Hunter was portrayed by character actor Mark Cameron in a supporting role. The film and the book have been slammed for historical inaccuracies and misrepresentation of characters. Both have been the subject of litigation: Johnny Giles successfully sued the book&#x27;s publishers for libel; Dave Mackay won an apology and undisclosed damages from the makers of the film. The &quot;World Soccer&quot; review says, as an aside to Giles&#x27; legal action: &#x27;Norman Hunter hardly says anything [in the book], but he&#x27;s still alive so escapes Peace&#x27;s hatchet job&#x27;.

Clough&#x27;s family were disgusted by the book and boycotted the film; friends of the family heavily criticised the film&#x27;s portrayal of Clough. Hunter is depicted as a dark and moody character who, in one scene, assaults Clough during a training session. Joe Jordan has categorically denied that such an incident ever happened and says of the whole drama: &#x27;There were just too many inaccuracies, too many people were saying things they didn&#x27;t say, and doing things they didn&#x27;t do&#x27;. The film&#x27;s negative portrayal of Hunter is sharply at odds with his real off-the-field persona, evidenced by the many tributes paid to him before and after his death, as &#x27;an amiable, popular and lovable man&#x27;. Hunter was one of the contributors to Phil Rostron&#x27;s retaliatory &quot;We Are the Damned United&quot;, published in August 2009, which sought to set the record straight about Leeds under Clough.

===Illness and death===

In 2013, Hunter was diagnosed with rare cancer type Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), which attacks blood and bone marrow. He received treatment for the rest of his life at the Leeds Cancer Centre.

On 10 April 2020, it was reported that Hunter was being treated in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. On 16 April, a bulletin said he was &#x27;severely unwell&#x27;. The following day, Leeds United announced that Hunter had died from the virus, aged 76, stating that &#x27;[his death] leaves a huge hole in the Leeds United family [and] his legacy will never be forgotten&#x27;. The club announced on 23 April that the South Stand at Elland Road would be renamed in his honour as the Norman Hunter South Stand.

In June 2021, Hunter&#x27;s family began the Norman Hunter Golf Day in his honour. This is an annual charity event at Horsforth Golf Club, where Hunter held membership, to raise funds for CLL cancer research in Leeds. In its first three years, the event raised £112,368. In May 2024, ahead of that year&#x27;s event, Norman&#x27;s wife Sue told Leeds Hospitals Charity that she was delighted with the response to the events and hoped the funds raised would help to revolutionise CLL treatment.

<doc id="697336" wikidata="Q6302471" url="?curid=697336" title="Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the Judge Advocate General is a judge responsible for the Court Martial process within the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. As such the post has existed since 2006; prior to this date the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s authority related to the Army and the RAF while the Judge Advocate of the Fleet was the equivalent with regard to the Royal Navy.

==Origins==
A Judge Martial is recorded as serving under the Earl of Leicester in the Netherlands in 1587–88. There were judge advocates on both sides during the English Civil War and following the Restoration the office of Judge Advocate of the Army (soon to be known as Judge Advocate General) was established on a permanent basis in 1666. Since 1682 the Judge Advocate General has been appointed by letters patent of the sovereign; until 1892 most judge advocates were Members of Parliament, indeed from 1806 the office was a political one, the holder resigning on a change of government.

After 1892 the role of Judge Advocate General became a judicial rather than a ministerial office; at first it was combined with the President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division before being made fully independent in 1905.

The Judge Advocate General has been entitled to appoint deputies since 1682.

==Role==
The Judge Advocate General is Head of the Service Justice System. The Judge Advocate General is the senior judge advocate and is the overall lead for the jurisdiction (i.e. is not under the authority of the Lord Chief Justice or any other presiding judge).

The Judge Advocate General is assisted by a team of judges who comprise the permanent judiciary, plus a small staff of civil servants. There is a total of seven judges, comprising one vice-judge advocate general, and six Assistant judge advocates general, all of whom must be barristers or advocates of seven years standing. Only judges appointed by the JAG may preside over proceedings in the Service courts, which comprise the Court Martial, the Summary Appeal Court, and the Service Civilian Court. The judges control the practice and procedure, give rulings on legal matters, and sum up the evidence for the jury (known as a &quot;board&quot;). Defendants are entitled to a defending counsel or solicitor, and their unit may provide an accused&#x27;s assisting officer if they so wish. The Judge Advocate General has higher authority over all units in the Armed Forces such as intelligence and combat units. The Judge Advocate General is equivalent to the position of Secretary of State for Defence.

The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s office holds cases deposited the originals of all records of proceedings, which are kept for at least six years.

===Historic role===
Historically the Judge Advocate General had responsibility for prosecuting cases as well as for summoning and supervising the court. In 1923 moves were made to separate responsibility for prosecutions from the judicial responsibilities of the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s office; complete separation was achieved 25 years later with the establishment of the Directorate of Army Legal Services in the War Office (and a parallel Directorate in the Air Ministry).

===Changes in the 2000s===
In the 1990s significant changes to the courts-martial system were instigated following European Court of Human Rights judgments. The Judge Advocate General was formerly the legal adviser of the armed forces, a role that ended in 2000. In both naval and military cases, all proceedings in the military courts of the United Kingdom are held under his or her authority (the former office of Judge Advocate of the Fleet having been amalgamated into that of the Judge Advocate General in 2006). Previously the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force had separate court martial arrangements, but all three Services have operated under a single system of service law since November 2009.

The former practice of reviewing the findings and sentences of all trials of the old courts-martial was abolished in October 2009. Now the outcome of each trial in the court martial (now a standing court) is final, subject to appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court. The Judge Advocate General has the authority to be the trier of fact for all cases, set rules, standards, procedures, and regulations for the Military courts of the United Kingdom.

==Qualifications==
The post is regulated by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951. The appointment is made by the British Sovereign on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Formerly, the Judge Advocate General had to be a barrister, advocate, or solicitor with higher rights of audience, of ten years&#x27; standing. As of 21 July 2008 the experience needed to qualify was reduced in line with a general move to broaden diversity in the judiciary. An appointee who has practised in England and Wales now has to satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a seven-year basis, while a practitioner from Scotland or Northern Ireland will need seven-years&#x27; standing as barrister, advocate or solicitor. The post is always held by a civilian rather than a commissioned officer, however an appointee may have previously been a member of the armed forces. In practice the post is held by a senior circuit judge.

==List of judge advocates general==
Through 1847, the dates are those of actual entrance upon office, not of the appointment, which is usually a few days earlier; or of the patent, commonly some days later than those adopted in this list. After 1847 the dates are those of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; notices of the appointment.

<doc id="697339" wikidata="Q1072420" url="?curid=697339" title="Primary biliary cholangitis">
<text>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an autoimmune disease of the liver. It results from a slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, causing bile and other toxins to build up in the liver, a condition called cholestasis. Further slow damage to the liver tissue can lead to scarring, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis.
Common symptoms are tiredness, itching, and in more advanced cases, jaundice. In early cases, the only changes may be those seen in blood tests.
PBC is a relatively rare disease, affecting up to one in 3,000–4,000 people. As with many other autoimmune diseases, it is much more common in women, with a sex ratio of at least 9:1 female to male. The reasons for this disparity are unclear, but may involve the expression of sex hormones such as estrogen, which impact immune system response.
The condition has been recognised since at least 1851, and was named &quot;primary biliary cirrhosis&quot; in 1949. Because cirrhosis is a feature only of advanced disease, a change of its name to &quot;primary biliary cholangitis&quot; was proposed by patient advocacy groups in 2014.
==Signs and symptoms==
People with PBC experience fatigue (80%); this is a nonspecific symptom and can be debilitating, with a huge impact on quality of life. Its pathogenesis is still unknown, and is quite challenging to explore its specificity and to treat. Comorbidities that could contribute to or worsen fatigue, such as depression, hypothyroidism, anaemia, obesity, or medication side effects, should be promptly identified and treated. Dry skin and dry eyes are also common. Itching (pruritus) occurs in 20–70% of cases, and can develop at any stage of the disease. Textbooks tend to describe itching in the feet and hands, but patients may also experience itching of the scalp, face, back, or other areas. The itching is typically mild-to-moderate in intensity. It may manifest as a tingling, crawling or burning sensation, and can develop even with normal liver function tests. It does not correlate with progression of liver disease, and may even improve or disappear as the disease advances. Given the impact on quality of life and night sleep, pruritus is also correlated with fatigue. It can rarely be severe, non-responsive to medical therapy, and requiring liver transplant. Pruritus is characteristically intermittent, worse at night, and improves during summer.
People with more severe PBC may have jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin). PBC impairs bone density and the risk of fracture increases. Xanthelasma (skin lesions around the eyes) or other xanthoma may be present as a result of increased cholesterol levels.

PBC can eventually progress to cirrhosis of the liver. This, in turn, may lead to a number of symptoms or complications, including:
* Fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites) in more advanced disease
* Enlarged spleen in more advanced disease
* Oesophageal varices in more advanced disease
* Hepatic encephalopathy, including coma in extreme cases in more advanced disease.

People with PBC may also sometimes have the findings of an associated extrahepatic autoimmune disorder such as thyroid disease or rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (in up to 80% of cases).

==Causes==
PBC has an immunological basis, and is classified as an autoimmune disorder. It results from a slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, with the intralobular ducts and the canals of Hering (intrahepatic ductules) being affected early in the disease.

Most people with PBC (more than 90%) have antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) against pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), an enzyme complex found in the mitochondria. People who are negative for AMAs are usually found to be positive when more sensitive methods of detection are used.

People with PBC may also have been diagnosed with another autoimmune disease, such as a rheumatological, endocrinological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or dermatological condition, suggesting shared genetic and immune abnormalities.
Common associations include Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, hypothyroidism, and coeliac disease.

A genetic predisposition to disease has been thought to be important for some time. Evidence for this includes cases of PBC in family members, identical twins both having the condition (concordance), and clustering of PBC with other autoimmune diseases. In 2009, a Canadian-led group of investigators reported in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; results from the first PBC genome-wide association study. This research revealed parts of the IL12 signaling cascade, particularly IL12A and IL12RB2 polymorphisms, to be important in the aetiology of the disease in addition to the HLA region. In 2012, two independent PBC association studies increased the total number of genomic regions associated to 26, implicating many genes involved in cytokine regulation such as &quot;TYK2&quot;, &quot;SH2B3&quot; and &quot;TNFSF11&quot;.

A study of over 2,000 patients identified a gene, &quot;POGLUT1&quot;, that appeared to be associated with this condition. Earlier studies have also suggested that this gene may be involved. The implicated protein is an endoplasmic reticulum O-glucosyltransferase.

An environmental Gram-negative Alphaproteobacterium — &quot;Novosphingobium aromaticivorans&quot; has been associated with this disease, with several reports suggesting an aetiological role for this organism. The mechanism appears to be a cross-reaction between the proteins of the bacterium and the mitochondrial proteins of the liver cells. The gene encoding &quot;CD101&quot; may also play a role in host susceptibility to this disease.

A failure of immune tolerance against the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) is a primary cause, with shedding of the antigen into apoptotic bodies or &quot;apotopes&quot; leading to the anatomic localization. Such autoreactivity may also be the case with other proteins, including the gp210 and p62 nuclear pore proteins. Gp210 has increased expression in the bile duct of anti-gp210 positive patients, and these proteins may be associated with prognosis.

==Diagnosis==
Most patients are currently diagnosed when asymptomatic, having been referred to the hepatologist for abnormal liver function tests (mostly raised GGT or alkaline phosphatase) performed for annual screening blood tests. Other frequent scenarios include screening of patients with nonliver autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, or investigation of elevated cholesterol, evaluation of itch or unresolved cholestasis &quot;post partum&quot;. Diagnosing PBC is generally straightforward. The basis for a definite diagnosis are:
* Abnormalities in liver enzyme tests are usually present and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase are found in early disease. Elevations in bilirubin occur in advanced disease.
* Antimitochondrial antibodies are the characteristic serological marker for PBC, being found in 90–95% of patients and only 1% of controls. PBC patients have AMA against pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), an enzyme complex that is found in the mitochondria. Those people who are AMA negative but with disease similar to PBC have been found to have AMAs when more sensitive detection methods are employed.
* Other auto-antibodies may be present:

:: Antinuclear antibody measurements are not diagnostic for PBC because they are not specific, but may have a role in prognosis.
:: Anti-glycoprotein-210 antibodies, and to a lesser degree anti-p62 antibodies, correlate with the disease&#x27;s progression toward end-stage liver failure. Anti-gp210 antibodies are found in 47% of PBC patients.
::Anti-centromere antibodies often correlate with developing portal hypertension.
::Anti-np62 and anti-sp100 are also found in association with PBC.
* Abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or a CT scan is usually performed to rule out blockage to the bile ducts. This may be needed if a condition causing secondary biliary cirrhosis, such as other biliary duct disease or gallstones, needs to be excluded. A liver biopsy may help, and if uncertainty remains as in some patients, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, an endoscopic investigation of the bile duct, may be performed.

Given the high specificity of serological markers, liver biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of PBC; however, it is still necessary when PBC-specific antibodies are absent, or when co-existent autoimmune hepatitis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is suspected. Liver biopsy can be useful to stage the disease for fibrosis and ductopenia. Finally, it may also be appropriate in the presence of other extrahepatic comorbidities.
===Liver biopsy===
On microscopic examination of liver biopsy specimens, PBC is characterized by chronic, nonsuppurative inflammation, which surrounds and destroys interlobular and septal bile ducts. These histopathologic findings in primary biliary cholangitis include:
* Inflammation of the bile ducts, characterized by intraepithelial lymphocytes
* Periductal epithelioid granulomas.
* Proliferation of bile ductules
* Fibrosis (scarring)

The Ludwig and Scheuer scoring systems have historically been used to stratify four stages of PBC, with stage 4 indicating the presence of cirrhosis. In the new system of Nakanuma, the stage of disease is based on fibrosis, bile duct loss, and features of cholestasis, i.e. deposition of orcein-positive granules, whereas the grade of necroinflammatory activity is based on cholangitis and interface hepatitis. The accumulation of orcein-positive granules occurs evenly across the PBC liver, which means that staging using the Nakanuma system is more reliable regarding sampling variability.

Liver biopsy for the diagnosis and staging of PBC lost favour after the evidence of a patchy distribution of the duct lesions and fibrosis across the organ. The widespread availability of noninvasive measures of fibrosis means that liver biopsy for staging of PBC is somewhat obsolete.
Liver biopsy does, however, remain useful in certain settings. The main indications are to confirm the diagnosis of PBC when PBC-specific antibodies are absent and confirm a diagnosis of PBC with AIH features (i.e. overlap PBC-AIH). Liver biopsy is also useful to assess the relative contribution of each liver injury when a comorbid liver disease is present, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In patients with inadequate response to UDCA, liver biopsy may provide the explanation and could undoubtedly inform risk stratification. For example, it may identify a previously unsuspected variant syndrome, steatohepatitis, or interface hepatitis of moderate or greater severity. It is also useful in AMA and ANA-specific antibody negative cholestatic patients to indicate an alternative process, e.g. sarcoidosis, small duct PSC, adult idiopathic ductopenia.

==Histopathology stages (by Ludwig and Scheuer systems)==
* Stage 1 – portal stage: Normal-sized triads, portal inflammation, subtle bile duct damage: Granulomas are often detected in this stage.
* Stage 2 – periportal stage: Enlarged triads, periportal fibrosis and/or inflammation, typically characterized by the finding of a proliferation of small bile ducts
* Stage 3 – septal stage: Active and/or passive fibrous septa
* Stage 4 – biliary cirrhosis: Nodules present, garland or jigsaw puzzle pattern

==Treatment==
===Cholestasis===
Medical therapy of PBC targets disease progression and symptom control. The first-line treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). UDCA has been the only drug available for two decades and more recently obeticholic acid (OCA), a semi-synthetic hydrophobic bile acid analogue, has been licensed in patients failing UDCA response or intolerant to UDCA. Several other agents have been studied, including immunosuppressants, but robust evidence of benefit is lacking.

UDCA improves liver enzyme levels, slows down histological progression, and improves liver transplant-free survival. UDCA also reduces the need for liver transplantation. UDCA should be taken at a dose of 13 to 15 mg per kg of body weight per day, usually in two divided doses each day. Liver chemistries usually improve within a few weeks of starting UDCA, and 90% of any benefit is observed after 6–9 months of therapy. Liver chemistries should be re-evaluated after 1 year of treatment. UDCA is usually continued lifelong. Up to 40% of people do not respond to treatment with UDCA. Patients with PBC who have an inadequate response to UDCA or those few (less than 3%) who are intolerant to UDCA are candidates for second-line therapies.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) is FDA-approved for the treatment of PBC in individuals intolerant or unresponsive to UDCA. OCA is a farnesoid X receptor agonist, and results in increased bile flow (choleresis). OCA is started at 5 mg daily, and liver chemistries should be rechecked after 3 months of treatment. If the liver chemistries remain elevated, then the dose of OCA may be increased to 10 mg per day. The most common side effect of OCA is pruritus.

Fibric acid derivatives, or fibrates, are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR), a nuclear receptor involved in several metabolic pathways. While fibrates are approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, they exert anticholestatic effects and have been studied for the treatment of PBC. Among the fibrates, bezafibrate and fenofibrate, PPAR-alpha selective agonists, have been extensively studied as therapeutic agents because of their potential ability to decrease bile acid synthesis and bile acid-related hepatic inflammation. A randomized, controlled trial in 2018 showed its efficacy in patients with inadequate response to UDCA. While fibrates can be considered as off-label treatment for PBC that does not respond to UDCA, they should not be used in decompensated cirrhosis.

Elafibranor (Iqirvo) was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2024.

Additional medications are being investigated as potential treatments for PBC, and found to be ineffective as single agents (monotherapy), including: chlorambucil, colchicine, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, malotilate, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, penicillamine, and thalidomide. Budesonide may be used as an off-label treatment for PBC, although its efficacy is controversial. Seladelpar, a PPAR-delta receptor agonist, is being studied for treatment of PBC.

Seladelpar (Livdelzi) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024.

===Itching===
Pruritus is a common symptom in people with PBC. First-line treatment of pruritus consists of anion-exchange resins, such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam. These anion-exchange resins are nonabsorbed, highly positively charged substances that bind bile acids, which are negatively charged anions. Anion-exchange resins relieve itching caused by excess bile acids in circulation by binding bile acids in the gut and facilitating elimination. Bloating or constipation may occur with anion-exchange resins. Cholestyramine may affect absorption of UDCA; if cholestyramine is necessary, it should be taken at least 60 minutes before or 4 hours after UDCA is taken.

Treatment options for pruritus that does not improve with anion-exchange resins include: rifampicin, naltrexone, or sertraline. Rifampicin may rarely cause drug induced liver injury and should be avoided if serum bilirubin is elevated (greater than 2.5 mg/dL). Liver enzymes should be monitored after starting rifampin. Rifampicin induces enzymes, resulting in numerous potential drug-drug interactions. Opioid antagonists may cause a self-limited opioid withdrawal like reaction, with abdominal pain, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, goose bumps, nightmares, and depersonalization. To avoid such reactions, the dose should start low and gradually be increased.

===Other therapies===
* Fatigue is a nonspecific but often-reported symptom in PBC, and represents an unmet need since no therapies are licensed. A structured approach to management, quantifying fatigue and its impacts (through the use of disease-specific tools such as the PBC-40 quality-of-life measures), addressing contributing and exacerbating factors, and supporting patients to cope with its impact is effective. Drugs such as coenzyme Q and rituximab have been shown to be ineffective. A graded programme of exercise helps some individuals.
* People with PBC may have poor lipid-dependent absorption of oil-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Appropriate supplementation is recommended when bilirubin is elevated.
* People with PBC are at elevated risk of developing osteoporosis as compared to the general population and others with liver disease. Screening and treatment of this complication is an important part of the management of PBC.
* As in all liver diseases, consumption of alcohol should be restricted or eliminated.
* In patients with advanced liver disease, the only curative therapy is liver transplant. Outcomes are favourable, with five-year patient survival rates better than for most other indications for LT (80–85%).

==Prognosis==
The introduction of UDCA has dramatically changed the pattern and the course of the disease. Numerous trials and observational studies have demonstrated its efficacy on liver biochemistry, histological progression, and transplant-free survival.

Among the UDCA-treated patients, the degree of the liver biochemistry improvement, i.e. the UDCA-response, identifies patients with different long-term prognosis. In the absence of cirrhosis, people who experience an improvement of liver enzymes to the normal range on treatment with UDCA have excellent survival, which may be similar to the general population. Survival is significantly reduced though, in those with abnormal liver biochemistry on treatment.

The two most important parameters in evaluating response to UDCA are alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Qualitative and quantitative definitions of UDCA-response have been developed, based on changes of bilirubin, transaminases and ALP, after a period of 6 to 24 months of treatment with UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg/day.

Patients at diagnosis can be risk-stratified based on the probability of UDCA-response. This is relevant to identify patients who would be eligible for second-line therapies before waiting for the treatment failure under UDCA, with potential impact on disease course.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is infrequent in PBC. Recent large-scale cohort studies highlighted that the lack of UDCA-response after 12 months of therapy and male sex are associated with increased future risk of developing HCC in PBC.

After liver transplant, the recurrence of disease may be as high as 18% at five years, and up to 30% at 10 years. No consensus exists on risk factors for recurrence of the disease.

==Epidemiology==
Epidemiologic studies report heterogeneous incidence rates of 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, and prevalence rates of 1.9 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. Such figures, in particular the prevalence, have shown some increase in the last decades. Improvement of diagnostic tools, increasing disease awareness, and digitised patient registration with facilitation of case-findings, along with improved survival, likely contributed to the rising prevalence rates.
The disease has been described worldwide, though North America and Northern Europe have shown the highest incidence and prevalence rates. Whether a true variation in disease prevalence exists among populations of different geographical areas and of different ethnicity or if this is a consequence of a difference in study quality is unknown. PBC is more common in women, with a female:male ratio of at least 9:1. The peak incidence of PBC is in the fifth decade of life. In some areas of the US and UK, the prevalence is estimated to be as high as one in 4,000. This is much more common than in South America or Africa, which may be due to better recognition in the US and UK. First-degree relatives may have as much as a 500 times increase in prevalence, but if this risk is greater in the same-generation relatives or the one that follows is debated.

PBC is considered a prime example of the female preponderance in autoimmunity with a female to male ratio of up to 9:1, confirmed by large cohort studies, although some recent data, using administrative registries, suggest an increasing male prevalence. Major defects of sex chromosomes, i.e. enhanced monosomy X in female patients and an enhanced Y chromosome loss in male patients, have been described and might well explain the greater female predisposition to develop PBC.

An association of a greater incidence of PBC at latitudes more distant from the Equator is similar to the pattern seen in multiple sclerosis.

Typical disease onset is between 30 and 60 years, though cases have been reported of patients diagnosed at the ages of 15 and 93. Prevalence of PBC in women over the age of 45 years could exceed one in an estimated 800 individuals.

==History==
The first report of the disease dates back 1851 by Addison and Gull, who described a clinical picture of progressive jaundice in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the large bile ducts. Ahrens et al. in 1950 published the first detailed description of 17 patients with this condition, and coined the term &quot;primary biliary cirrhosis&quot;. In 1959, Dame Sheila Sherlock reported a further series of PBC patients and recognised that the disease could be diagnosed in a precirrhotic stage and proposed the term &quot;chronic intrahepatic cholestasis&quot; as more appropriate description of this disease, but this nomenclature failed to gain acceptance, and the term &quot;primary biliary cirrhosis&quot; lasted for decades. In 2014, to correct the inaccuracy and remove the social stigma of cirrhosis, as well as all the misunderstanding, disadvantages, and discrimination emanating from this misnomer in daily life for patients, international liver associations agreed to rename the disease &quot;primary biliary cholangitis&quot;, as it is now known.
==Society and culture==

===Support groups===

====PBC Foundation====
The PBC Foundation is a UK-based international charity offering support and information to people with PBC and their families and friends. It campaigns for increasing recognition of the disorder, improved diagnosis, and treatments, and estimates over 8,000 people are undiagnosed in the UK. The Foundation has supported research into PBC including the development of the PBC-40 quality of life measure published in 2004 and helped establish the PBC Genetics Study. It was founded by Collette Thain in 1996, after she was diagnosed with the condition. Thain was awarded an MBE Order of the British Empire in 2004 for her work with the Foundation. The PBC Foundation helped initiate the name change campaign in 2014.

====PBCers Organization====
The PBCers Organization is a US-based nonprofit patient support group that was founded by Linie Moore in 1996; it advocates for greater awareness of the disease and new treatments. It supported the name change initiative.

<text>Michael David Jones (born 24 April 1945) is an English former footballer who played as centre forward with Leeds United during the 1960s and 1970s. He was also capped for England.

==Career==

===Sheffield United===
Jones was spotted playing local league football for Dinnington Miners&#x27; Welfare, from where he went on to become an apprentice at Sheffield United in 1961. He graduated from the intermediate side through the Central League side before making his debut in a 1–1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 20 April 1963. He scored his first two league goals in the next fixture, a 3–1 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road four days later, on his 18th birthday. He made his England debut in 1965 against West Germany at centre forward.

Jones scored 63 goals in 149 appearances for the Blades, and had earned two caps for England when he joined Leeds United in September 1967 for £100,000, prompting the Sheffield United manager, John Harris, to remark &quot;it would be the biggest mistake the club had ever made&quot;.

===Leeds United===
Leeds won the League Cup in his first season, although Jones did not feature in the campaign because he was cup-tied. Leeds also won the Fairs Cup, with Jones scoring twice during the competition, including what turned out to be the winner in the final against Ferencvaros. The first leg finished 1–0 thanks to Jones&#x27; goal and the second leg remained goalless to give Leeds the cup.

The following season Leeds won the League championship with Jones scoring 14 goals, and then joined by fellow striker Allan Clarke in 1969 to forge a strike partnership with Jones.

Leeds pursued a possible &quot;treble&quot; of League title, FA Cup and European Cup. Everton beat Leeds to the League title, and Celtic F.C. beat Leeds home and away in the European Cup semi-finals. In the FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, the game was 1–1 on a bumpy, sandy pitch (due to the &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; show being held there the previous week). with fewer than ten minutes to play. Jones fired a left foot shot into the net beyond Peter Bonetti. Chelsea, however, equalised quickly so the contest went to a replay at Old Trafford. Leeds took the lead in the first half, when a run by Clarke set Jones on his way towards goal, and he hit right foot shot past Bonetti. Chelsea, however, ended up winning after extra time and Leeds ended the season trophyless.

In 1972, Leeds beat Arsenal 1–0 in the Centenary FA Cup Final with Jones setting up Clarke for the only goal of the game. However, Jones suffered a dislocated elbow in the last minute of the game after landing awkwardly from an innocuous and accidental clash with the Arsenal goalkeeper, Geoff Barnett. Jones was assisted by Norman Hunter, up to the Royal Box to collect his F.A. Cup winners medal. The injury however, meant Jones missed the League title decider away to Wolves just two days later which Wolves won 2–1. The defeat cost Leeds the Division 1 championship title to Derby County by a single point. Perhaps his finest performance of the 1971–72 season came on 19 February 1972, when he scored a hat-trick against Manchester United in a 5–1 league win at Elland Road.

In a 29-match unbeaten run at the start of the next season, Jones bagged 14 goals as Leeds won the title, but he was now beginning to have problems with one of his knees and spent the summer of 1974 having intensive physiotherapy. In early 1975, he began playing reserve football again, but in constant pain. Joe Jordan took the number nine shirt. The team (despite Revie&#x27;s departure in the summer to take over the England job) reached its first European Cup final, Jones was a spectator who did not figure in the team all season. He watched as Leeds lost the European Cup final to Bayern Munich and then retired at the age of 30, unable to beat his knee problem. His Leeds career ended with 111 goals from 312 appearances. Allan Clarke, Jones&#x27; strike partner, admitted that it was never the same for him after Jones retired.

===International career===

Jones played three matches as a centre forward for England, all friendlies, between 1965 and 1970. He played his international debut on 12 May 1965, when he was aged 20, England beating West Germany 1–0. He played his second game for his country whilst still at Sheffield United in a 2–1 victory for England over Sweden at the Ullevi Stadium, Gothenburg on 16th May 1965. His third and last match for the Three Lions was on 14 January 1970, whilst at Leeds United, in a 0–0 draw with the Netherlands.

<doc id="697354" wikidata="Q2993355" url="?curid=697354" title="Social proof">
<text>Social proof (or informational social influence) is a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in choosing how to behave in a given situation. The term was coined by Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book &quot;&quot;.

Social proof is used in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate &quot;mode of behavior&quot;, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

The effects of social influence can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform. This is referred to in some publications as the &quot;herd behavior&quot;. Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others, formal analysis shows that it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice, so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information (see information cascades).

Social proof is one type of conformity. When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior. When &quot;we conform because we believe that others&#x27; interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action&quot;, it is informational social influence. This is contrasted with normative social influence wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others.

Social proof often leads not only to public compliance (conforming to the behavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct) but also private acceptance (conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct).
Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable.
== Mechanisms ==

===Uncertainty about the correct conclusion===
Uncertainty is a major factor that encourages the use of social proof. One study found that when evaluating a product, consumers were more likely to incorporate the opinions of others through the use of social proof when their own experiences with the product were ambiguous, leaving uncertainty as to the correct conclusion that they should make.

===Similarity to the surrounding group===
Similarity also motivates the use of social proof; when a person perceives themselves as similar to the people around them, they are more likely to adopt and perceive as correct the observed behavior of these people. This has been noted in areas such as the use of laugh tracks, where participants will laugh longer and harder when they perceive the people laughing to be similar to themselves.

Social proof is also one of Robert Cialdini&#x27;s six principles of persuasion, (along with reciprocity, commitment/consistency, authority, liking, and scarcity) which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them. One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign, who found that if a list of prior donators was longer, the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well. This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the prospective donor knew, such as friends and neighbors. Cialdini&#x27;s principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely to respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically, so people are more likely to be persuaded by a colleague than a superior.

== Research ==

=== Early research ===
The most famous study of social proof is Muzafer Sherif&#x27;s 1935 experiment. In this experiment subjects were placed in a dark room and asked to look at a dot of light about 15 feet away. They were then asked how much, in inches, the dot of light was moving. In reality it was not moving at all, but due to the autokinetic effect it appeared to move. How much the light appears to move varies from person to person but is generally consistent over time for each individual. A few days later a second part of the experiment was conducted. Each subject was paired with two other subjects and asked to give out loud their estimate of how much the light was moving. Even though the subjects had previously given different estimates, the groups would come to a common estimate. To rule out the possibility that the subjects were simply giving the group answer to avoid looking foolish while still believing their original estimate was correct, Sherif had the subjects judge the lights again by themselves after doing so in the group. They maintained the group&#x27;s judgment. Because the movement of the light is ambiguous the participants were relying on each other to define reality.

Another study looked at informational social influence in eyewitness identification. Subjects were shown a slide of the &quot;perpetrator&quot;. They were then shown a slide of a line-up of four men, one of whom was the perpetrator they had seen, and were asked to pick him out. The task was made difficult to the point of ambiguity by presenting the slides very quickly. The task was done in a group that consisted of one actual subject and three confederates (a person acting as a subject but actually working for the experimenter). The confederates answered first and all three gave the same wrong answer. In a high-importance condition of the experiment, subjects were told that they were participating in a real test of eyewitness identification ability that would be used by police departments and courts, and that their scores would establish the norm for performance. In a low-importance condition, subjects were told that the slide task was still being developed and that the experimenters had no idea what the norm for performance was—they were just looking for useful hints to improve the task. It was found that when subjects thought the task was of high importance, they were more likely to conform, giving the confederate&#x27;s wrong answer 51% of the time, as opposed to 35% of the time in the low-importance condition.

===Cultural effects on social proof===
The strength of social proof also varies across different cultures. For instance, studies have shown that subjects in collectivist cultures conform to others&#x27; social proof more often than those in individualist cultures. Although this trend seems reoccurring, there is evidence which suggests that these results are a simplification, and that an independent subject&#x27;s personal individualistic-collectivist tendency also makes an impact upon their decisions. Additional variables, such as the subject&#x27;s sense of social responsibility, need to be taken into account to better understand the mechanisms of social proof across cultures; for example, more collectivist individuals will often have an increased compulsion to help others because of their prominent awareness of social responsibility, and this in turn will increase the likelihood they will comply to requests, regardless of their peers&#x27; previous decisions.

=== Copycat suicides ===

Social proof has been proposed as an explanation for copycat suicide, where suicide rates increase following media publication about suicides. One study using agent-based modeling showed that copycat suicides are more likely when there are similarities between the person involved in the publicized suicide and the potential copycats. In addition, research performed by David Phillips between 1947 and 1968 further supports the existence of copycat suicides.

== Examples ==

===In entertainment===
Theaters sometimes use specially planted audience members who are instructed to give ovations at pre-arranged times. Usually, these people are the ones who clap initially, and the rest of the audience follows. Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert audience members as signals of the performance&#x27;s quality.

In television shows, television studios have discovered that they can increase the perceived &quot;funniness&quot; of a show by playing a pre-recorded laugh track at key moments. They have found that even though viewers find a laugh track annoying, they perceive shows that use canned laughter to be funnier than those that do not.

===In e-commerce===
In e-commerce, social proof takes the form of positive testimonials from previous customers. Showcasing these testimonials is one of the tactics that is found to be effective in encouraging potential customers to sign up.

=== In social media ===
Social proof is exploited on social networks such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The number of followers, fans, views, likes, favorites and even comments that a user has made, positively affects how other users perceive them. A user on X (formerly Twitter) with a million followers is perceived as more trustworthy and reputable than a similar user with a thousand followers, resulting in faster growth of followers and higher engagement and click-through-rates.

<doc id="697357" wikidata="Q5942182" url="?curid=697357" title="Walter Leaf">
<text>Sir Walter Leaf (26 November 1852, Upper Norwood – 8 March 1927, Torquay) was an English banker, classical scholar, and psychical researcher. He published a benchmark edition of Homer&#x27;s Iliad and was a director of Westminster Bank for many years, eventually becoming its chairman. He was a co-founder and later president of the International Chamber of Commerce and served as president of the Institute of Bankers, the Hellenic Society, and the Classical Association. He married Charlotte Symonds, the daughter of John Addington Symonds. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

==Academic career==
Walter Leaf was born on 26 November 1852. In 1865, he won a scholarship to Winchester College. However, his parents became concerned that living conditions at Winchester would be unacceptable, so they rented a house at Harrow on the edge of London, where their son enrolled in April 1866 at Harrow School as a day pupil. From Harrow, he progressed to Trinity College, Cambridge. He won a scholarship to Trinity in 1870, became a senior classic in 1874, and was elected to a fellowship the following year. He was concerned with uncovering the physical reality of the classical world, in contrast to the Cambridge Ritualists, and was the foremost Homer scholar of his generation. His edition of the Iliad was published in two volumes (1886–1888) and was regarded for several decades as the best English edition of Homer&#x27;s epic poem. Leaf also translated works from Russian and Persian, and was fluent in several European languages, including French, Italian, and German. He was president of the Hellenic Society and the Classical Association. He also took an interest in ancient geography.

==Banking==
In 1877, he entered the family textile firm, becoming chairman of Leaf &amp; Company Ltd. in 1888. In 1892, Leaf &amp; Co. merged with Pawson &amp; Co. to become Pawsons and Leafs Limited. Walter became a director of what would become Westminster Bank in 1891 and its chairman from 1918 until his death. From 1919 to 1921, he was president of the Institute of Bankers. He worked tirelessly for the International Chamber of Commerce, of which he was a co-founder in 1919 and elected president in 1925.

==Psychical research==

Leaf was a member of the Society for Psychical Research. He translated Vsevolod Solovyov&#x27;s &quot;A Modern Priestess of Isis&quot; (1895).

Leaf studied the medium, Leonora Piper. He did not believe that the personality of a person could survive death but came to the conclusion that &quot;memories of the dead survive and are under special conditions accessible to us.&quot; This was in opposition to sceptics such as psychologist G. Stanley Hall, who described her mediumship as a case of secondary personality.

==Death==
It was his doctor who early in 1927 recommended him to visit Torquay, in the south-west of England, for the sake of his health. After a few weeks he died there, however. His funeral ceremony was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
