<text>Next plc, trading as Next(styled as NEXT) is a British multinational clothing, footwear and home products retailer, which has its headquarters in Enderby, England. It has around 700 stores, of which circa 500 are in the United Kingdom, and circa 200 across Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Next is the largest clothing retailer by sales in the United Kingdom, having overtaken Marks &amp; Spencer in early 2012 and 2014. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
===Hepworth===
The company was founded by Joseph Hepworth in Leeds in 1864 as a tailor under the name of Joseph Hepworth &amp; Son. Initially Hepworth was in partnership with James Rhodes, but the partnership was dissolved in 1872.

On his own, Hepworth expanded the company rapidly, becoming a pioneer of the development of chain stores in Britain. By 1884 the company had 100 outlets.

For much of its history Hepworth was predominantly in the ready-to-wear suit market. In 1963, the company brought in the celebrated Savile Row designer Hardy Amies to help revitalise its ready-to-wear suit collection.

===Kendall&#x27;s and Next===
In 1981, the company bought womenswear retailer Kendall &amp; Sons for £1.75 million from the retail conglomerate Combined English Stores. This gave Hepworth over 600 shops in British high streets.

The intention was to redevelop Kendall&#x27;s stores as a womenswear chain of shops to complement Hepworth as a chain of menswear stores. Designer Terence Conran was Chairman of Hepworth at that time, and recruited George Davies to work at Kendall&#x27;s. However, Davies&#x27;s concept was to create a new chain, called Next, initially by converting Kendall&#x27;s stores. The first Next shops opened on 12 February 1982, with the Kendall&#x27;s conversion complete by the end of 1983.
Appointed chief executive in 1984, Davies then converted 50 Hepworth stores to the Next format, extending the range to cover menswear. This allowed the development of mini department stores selling women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s clothes. This was added to by the introduction of Next interiors to stores which were deemed in the &quot;right demographical areas.&quot; In 1986, Davies moved the group&#x27;s headquarters from Leeds to Leicester, to be closer to the main garment manufacturers, and the company name was changed to Next plc.

In 1987, the group acquired Combined English Stores and the Grattan catalogue company. Extending first to introduce Next childrenswear, Davies then introduced the Next Directory.

By 1988, &quot;after seven years of growth, Next had over-expanded suicidally&quot; .. &quot;some stores were not bringing in enough to pay the rent.&quot; Davies was sacked and the share price fell to 7p. Chairman Sir David Jones accused Davies of being egotistical and taking Next to the verge of bankruptcy.

In October 1988, Next sold 433 jewellery stores in the United Kingdom, which principally traded under the Salisburys and Zales brands, to the Ratners Group for US$232 million.

The company bought the youth brand Lipsy in 2008. In autumn 2009, Next launched an online catalogue for the United States offering clothing, shoes and accessories for women, men and children.

Next&#x27;s prices in Ireland attracted criticism in 2009 when the company was one of four retailers accused of failing to pass on exchange rate savings to shoppers in the Republic.

In July 2010, a BBC investigation found Next was breaking the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 by billing customers for its delivery costs even if goods were returned within the seven working days. A spokesman for Next admitted that they had been doing this for three years but promised to comply by August 2010. Trading Standards said that the DSRs had been in force for ten years, and there was no excuse for not adhering to them.

In 2014, Next launched localised cross-border sales to Ukraine.

===Wages controversy===
In May 2014, the Living Wage Foundation bought Next shares and attended the annual general meeting in an attempt to persuade the company to pay at least £6.70 and become one of the UK&#x27;s 700 living wage employers. Next was targeted because it claimed to be a good employer and was thriving. Professor Sir George Bain, who set the minimum wage in 1999, said employers could afford to pay much more but acknowledged enforcement could cause unemployment in the retail sector.

In October 2014, the company was one of several retailers criticised by journalist Janice Turner in &quot;The Times&quot; for failing to pay what she described as a living wage. Turner further argued UK taxpayers pay £28 billion to low-paid workers through tax credits, and retail companies – which have the highest proportion of low paid workers – are exploiting austerity and effectively adding staff wages to the UK welfare bill. When asked to explain the salaries of lower-wage workers despite large profits, a Next spokesperson replied that the company had thirty applicants for every job advertised.
===Recent history===
In September 2018, the company&#x27;s Irish operations profits were separated from Next plc. Next (Ireland) Ltd was formally established to focus on the distribution of products in its physical stores and its online store in the Republic of Ireland. At the same time Next Germany was established.

In November 2022, it was announced Next had acquired the London-headquartered furniture retailer, Made.com - which (in the same month) had gone into administration.

In December 2022, the company entered into a joint venture with Tom Joule to buy The Joules Group out of administration for £34 million. Tom Joule retained 26% of the equity in the business. 

In March 2023, it was announced Next had acquired vintage fashion and homeware retailer Cath Kidston out of administration for £8.5 million. The acquisition meant Next had bought the brand name, domain names and intellectual property, but remaining stock was to be sold off by administrators and the four Cath Kidston stores (London, York, Ashford, Cheshire Oaks) were to shut.

The company makes use of Uyghur forced labour provided by the China based supplier, Beijing Guanghua Textile Group, according to research of the Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice, the socialists and democrats in the European Parliament and further institutions published in December 2023. 

==Operations==
Next has three main channels: Next Retail, a chain of 550+ retail branches in the United Kingdom; Next Directory, a home shopping catalogue and website with more than 3 million active customers, and Next International, with 180+ international stores. Its other businesses include Next Sourcing, for own brand products; Lipsy, which designs and sells its own branded younger women&#x27;s fashion products through wholesale, retail and website channels.

Next operates stores and e-commerce for Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the UK. In September 2021, Next announced a joint venture with Gap. Next will manage Gap&#x27;s UK website and place Gap concessions in some Next stores. The deal preserves Gap&#x27;s presence on the UK high street after Gap announced in July 2021 it would close all of its UK stores.

==Financial data==
Numbers are in millions of pounds:
==Logos and marketing==
Until circa 1991 Next used a lower case Courier-style typeface in black against a white background for its logo. This was replaced by the capitalised NEXT logo in a Roman-serif style type face. There were some variations of this such as the logo with each letter of NEXT in an individual square and in some stores in 2005/2006 had the Next logo in a varying blue &amp; black background with &quot;X&#x27;s&quot; printed on them, as opposed to the black background. In addition, some variations in typeface occurred during the logo&#x27;s use – including similar fonts that had serifs positioned above the &quot;T&quot; crossbar, similar to Garamond and others that had more in common with Times New Roman. In 2007 a new next logo was introduced, although the previous logo continued to be used until stock was exhausted.

Next clothing often carries reference to the origins of the company in 1982 with use of &quot;82&quot; or &quot;1982&quot; as a design feature on clothes in all ranges.

Prior to 2007 Next only advertised immediately prior to a sale, usually through brief television spots and newspaper advertising. In 2007 following a &quot;disappointing&quot; 7.2% fall in like for like sales, it announced it was investing &quot;£17 million over the next three years to revive its existing stores and product offering&quot; + an additional £10m for marketing. Yasmin Le Bon who modelled in the first Next Directory in Spring 1988 featured in an on-line fashion show.

In September 2007, to celebrate its 25th anniversary, Next launched its first television campaign in twelve years named &#x27;Ali&#x27;s Party&#x27; with the song &#x27;Suddenly I See&#x27; and starring Brazilian supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio. All extra casts were Next employees, otherwise nicknamed &#x27;nextras&#x27;. A second advert featuring Ambrosio, was screened in November 2007 and the songs were regularly played instore during the campaign.

An advert directed by Ben Watts and filmed on the banks of the River Seine was shown in September 2010 to reflect the season&#x27;s Parisian chic styles. It was soundtracked by The Specials’ &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot; and starred Brazilian model Emanuela de Paula and Spanish actor Jon Kortajarena.

<doc id="722805" wikidata="Q2889509" url="?curid=722805" title="Battle of New Bern">
<text>The Battle of New Bern (also known as the Battle of New Berne) was fought on March 14, 1862, near the city of New Bern, North Carolina, as part of the Burnside Expedition of the American Civil War. The US Army&#x27;s Coast Division, led by Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside and accompanied by armed vessels from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, were opposed by an undermanned and badly trained Confederate force of North Carolina soldiers and militia led by Brigadier General Lawrence O&#x27;B. Branch. Although the defenders fought behind breastworks that had been set up before the battle, their line had a weak spot in its center that was exploited by the attacking Federal soldiers. When the center of the line was penetrated, many of the militia broke, forcing a general retreat of the entire Confederate force. General Branch was unable to regain control of his troops until they had retreated to Kinston, more than 30 miles (about 50 km) away. New Bern came under Federal control, and remained so for the rest of the war.

==Background==
New Bern lies on the left (southwest) bank of the Neuse River, about 37 miles (60 km) above its exit into Pamlico Sound. The river is broad in this vicinity, and is deep enough that vessels that can navigate the sound can also ply the river. In the colonial era, the town was quite important as a seaport, but by the time of the Civil War Morehead City and Beaufort had largely supplanted it. Nevertheless, New Bern was still a significant military target, as the railroad (Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad) that connected the coast with the interior passed through the city. A short distance further up, at Goldsboro (spelled Goldsborough in the 19th century), the line crossed the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, noted for keeping the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia supplied throughout the war. Thus, if New Bern were to fall into Federal hands, an important link in the supply chain of that army would be broken.

The land in this part of North Carolina is low and rather flat, and is sometimes marshy. In 1862, the solid land was mostly covered with open pine forest, although in places it was broken into low hills with deciduous forests, separated by ravines. It is crossed by many creeks that sometimes rise to the status of small rivers. One of these, the Trent River, separates New Bern from the land to its south. The slightly smaller Slocum&#x27;s Creek, enters 16 miles (26 km) farther down the Neuse. It was to be the landing site for the attacking Federal forces.

The entire action, aside from the takeover of the city, was confined to the land between these two streams. The railroad ran on a system of berms and occasional cuts about a mile (1.6 km) inland from the river. It entered the city on a bridge over the Trent River. A county road passed over the same land, also connecting New Bern with Morehead City and Beaufort. In the vicinity of the battle, it lay between railroad and the river, but it crossed the railroad about a mile and a half (2 km) north of what would be the battlefield. The road continued to the northwest, crossing the Trent on a drawbridge some 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the city. In the manner of the time, the road was unpaved, as the Union soldiers learned to their sorrow.

==Prelude==
Following the secession of North Carolina from the Union, the defenses of the state were neglected by the Confederate government in Richmond. The War Department, directed at first by Secretary Leroy P. Walker and later by Judah P. Benjamin, used the state&#x27;s best-trained and best-equipped troops to take part in the campaigns in Virginia, which were given a higher priority. They were seen as protecting the Confederate capital of Richmond. When Hatteras Island fell to Union forces in August 1861, only six regiments of infantry were available to defend the entire coast of the state.

By that time, the Confederacy had divided the coastal defense into separate districts for command purposes; the northern part, from near Cape Lookout to the Virginia border, was assigned to Brig. Gen. Daniel H. Hill, who set up the defensive lines around New Bern. South of the city, across the Trent River, he had built two primary lines. First was a system of breastworks named the &quot;Croatan Works,&quot; near Otter Creek and extending inland as far as the railroad. Six miles (10 km) closer to the city was another substantial line anchored on the river by Fort Thompson. The fort held 13 guns, three of which bore on landward approaches. Hill ordered construction of a series of batteries along the river to defend against attack by naval forces. The Confederates blocked the river with two barriers. The first, a mile and a half (2.4 km) below Fort Thompson, consisted of a double row of piles cut off below the water, capped with iron, and backed by a row of 30 torpedoes (present-day mines). Each torpedo contained about 200 pounds (100 kg) of powder. The second was opposite Fort Thompson and consisted of a row of hulks and &quot;chevaux de frise,&quot; which would force ships to pass under the guns of the fort.

Hill hoped that he would be given sufficient manpower to fill his lines, but he was transferred to service in Virginia before the hoped-for additional troops arrived. Shortly after he was succeeded by Brig. Gen. Lawrence O&#x27;B. Branch, the district was divided again. Branch&#x27;s command extended from Cape Lookout north only to the limits of Pamlico Sound. From there to the Virginia border and beyond was assigned to Brig. Gen. Benjamin Huger, whose primary concern was the defense of Norfolk and environs. This meant in particular that Roanoke Island, between Croatan Sound and Roanoke Sound just north of Pamlico Sound, was not included in Branch&#x27;s command.

Roanoke Island fell to a combined operation of the Union Army&#x27;s Coast Division, under Brig. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, and a Union gunboat flotilla assembled from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, under Flag Officer Louis M Goldsborough, on February 7–8, 1862. That battle was rapidly followed up by the gunboats alone, who wiped out the Confederate Navy&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet in an assault on Elizabeth City. Shortly afterward, Goldsborough had to leave the sounds for duties at Hampton Roads, and immediate command of the ships he left behind fell to Commander Stephen C. Rowan. As a result of the battles, Union forces could move at will in Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. Every city and town accessible to those sounds hence became vulnerable to attack. The most important was New Bern, and Burnside soon resolved to take it.
The importance of New Bern was no more obvious to Burnside than it was to the Confederate authorities in Richmond, but they did little to secure it. Although more than a month passed after Roanoke Island fell before Burnside could mount an attack on the city, the local command received no reinforcements. One of General Branch&#x27;s aides estimated that the lines would need at least 6,130 men to hold them, but he had only about 4,000 at his disposal, a number often reduced by sickness. Furthermore, many of the men were poorly armed militiamen. The disparity between necessity and reality persuaded Branch to draw his lines in, abandoning some of the strong breastworks erected by his predecessor. The principal defense would be the line based on Fort Thompson.

The Fort Thompson line that had been set up by General Hill extended only from the river to the railroad. They ended on the right in a brickyard that would figure prominently in the fighting. Because the land farther to the right was fairly firm and would allow his position to be flanked, General Branch decided to extend the line beyond the railroad and end it in a swamp. This just about doubled the length of the defensive line. He made a major blunder in laying out the line, however. In haste to complete the extension and faced with an exasperating shortage of labor, he decided to use a small creek as a natural part of the line. This creek intersected the railroad at a point some 150 yards (135 meters) up from the brickyard. The line of breastworks therefore had a dogleg in its center.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
The confederate defenses included 4000 men behind temporary defenses. The confederate defenders were common infantry, cavalry, and artillery from North Carolina. They were led by Brig. Gen. Lawrence Branch. The Confederate defenders armed themselves with ten cannons from two artillery batteries. Additional confederate defenses included river obstructions in the Neuse river. Forts including Lane, Ellis, Allen, Thompson, and Dixie served as defenses to protect the area. Two entrenchments were also dug as defenses along the land routes of the West Bank. The Confederates suffered 68 deaths, 116 wounded, and 425 captured or missing. Out of all the cannons, only two were saved. All the confederate soldiers lost their equipment during the battle. 

==Battle==
===Advance===
The soldiers of the Coast Division clambered into their transports at Roanoke Island on March 11, 1862 and got under way early the next morning, accompanied by 14 Navy gunboats and one gunboat of their own. One of the Navy vessels was detached to guard the mouth of the Pamlico River, where it was incorrectly rumored that the Rebels were preparing two ships to cut off transports that might become separated from Navy protection. The main force traversed Pamlico Sound, entered the Neuse River, and anchored near the mouth of Slocum&#x27;s Creek at dusk. The fleet that traveled up the Neuse River was full of infantry who left their ships and setup south of confederate soldiers at Fort Thompson. These confederate soldiers consisted of 4000 men who were behind temporary defenses. Branch was aware of their presence, and immediately ordered his forces to take up defensive positions. He sent Col. James Sinclair&#x27;s 35th North Carolina Infantry to the landing at Otter Creek, in front of the Croatan work, with instructions to oppose enemy landings at that site. Colonel Zebulon Vance&#x27;s 26th North Carolina was ordered into the Croatan work. Other units guarded the river upstream, and reserves were assembled at the intersection of the railroad and the Beaufort road. All units were instructed that if they were forced from their positions, they should fall back on the Fort Thompson line.

At dawn on March 13, the Federal troops began to disembark. A small Rebel unit trying to contest the landing was quickly driven away by fire from the gunboats, as Col. Sinclair interpreted his orders to defend against a landing at Otter Creek narrowly. Burnside spent the morning getting men and equipment ashore. With the infantry came six boat (Navy) howitzers and two Army howitzers. Because of the weather, he decided to land his other artillery closer to the enemy lines, but dense fog soon closed in, and he could not communicate with the fleet. His remaining guns were not landed.

A little after noon the Union soldiers began to move toward the Confederate lines, and at about the same time the rains began. The road was soon turned into mud, and the mere act of walking required great exertion. The gunners with the howitzers accompanying the infantry soon were exhausted trying to move their pieces, so a regiment of infantry (51st Pennsylvania) were detailed to help them. Many of those foot soldiers long remembered this as the most arduous part of the battle.

As the soldiers made their slow progress, the gunboats kept a short distance ahead, shelling places where Rebels might be waiting. Col. R. P. Campbell, in command of the Confederate right wing, interpreted the naval gunfire as preliminary to another landing that would take the Croatan work in reverse, so he ordered a general pullback to the Fort Thompson line. Thus, when the Federal army came upon the first Confederate breastworks, they found them abandoned.

The Coast Division soon resumed its march. Leaving the Croatan work, First (Foster&#x27;s) Brigade moved on the right, following the county road, while Second (Reno&#x27;s) Brigade followed the railroad on the left. Third (Parke&#x27;s) Brigade followed after the First. They continued until they came in contact with enemy pickets, about a mile and a half (2 km) away from the Fort Thompson line held by the Rebels. Daylight having been exhausted, Burnside ordered a halt and had the brigades bivouac in the order of their march: First Brigade on the right near the road, Second Brigade on the left near the railroad, and Third Brigade to the rear of the First. The howitzers did not arrive until 0300 the next morning.

===The fight===

The field was covered by a dense fog on the morning of March 14. Burnside ordered his forces to form and advance on the Rebel works. The Yankees did not have complete information concerning their opponents&#x27; disposition at this time; so far as they knew, the Confederate line extended only from the river to the brickyard. In keeping with this belief, Burnside ordered the First Brigade to engage the enemy left, while the Second Brigade would try to turn their right, at the brickyard. The eight howitzers were deployed across the county road. Third Brigade was held as a reserve. The Army also got some dubious support from the gunboats under Commander Stephen C. Rowan, who shelled the Rebel positions although they were hidden by intervening forests. This gunfire greatly disturbed the North Carolinians, but it was inaccurate enough that Burnside eventually asked Cowan to change direction.

Meanwhile, on the other side, General Branch had put his regiments into the line. From his left, at Fort Thompson, to the brickyard on his right, were the 27th, 37th, 7th, and 35th North Carolina regiments. His reserve was the 33rd Regiment. The right flank of the 35th was anchored in a brickyard kiln that was loopholed for artillery. The entire line beyond the railroad was occupied by a single regiment, the 26th North Carolina, plus a few companies of cavalry. The gap in his line created by the dogleg at the railroad was covered only by his weakest unit, a militia battalion with only two weeks of training, and armed with shotguns and hunting rifles. To give them additional support, he ordered up a two-gun battery of 24-pounders to the kiln, but they were not mounted when they came under attack. The First Brigade of the Union Army opposed them from the river to the railroad; right to left, the units were the 25th, 24th, 27th, and 23rd Massachusetts, and the 10th Connecticut. The Beaufort Road ran through the center of this line, and here General Foster placed the howitzers that had been dragged along.

On the Federal left, General Reno, still unaware of the extension of the enemy lines beyond the railroad, ordered a part of the 21st Massachusetts to charge the brick kiln, while the 9th New Jersey and the 51st New York would engage the enemy in support. The 51st Pennsylvania was held in reserve. The charge was successful at first, but they then found themselves under fire from the whole line and were forced to pull back.

Burnside at this time ordered his reserve, the Third Brigade, into the line to support Reno&#x27;s Second Brigade. The 4th Rhode Island replaced the 21st Massachusetts, which had used up its ammunition. While trading places, Colonel Isaac P. Rodman of the 4th Rhode Island was told by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Clark of the 21st Massachusetts that he thought that another attack on the brick kiln would be successful. Rodman sent a courier to General Parke informing him that he was taking responsibility, then formed his regiment and ordered them to charge. Armed with better knowledge of the enemy, this charge was successful. The 4th Rhode Island captured nine brass field pieces, and found themselves in rear of the Rebel entrenchments.

At this point, the Confederate line broke. The rupture started when the inexperienced militiamen fled and exposed the units on both of their flanks. Branch ordered his reserves to plug the gap, but they did not arrive in time. As the line was rolled up on both wings, each regimental commander in succession pulled his unit back to escape being slaughtered. General Branch ordered a retreat, which soon became a rout. The fleeing North Carolinians dashed across the bridge over the Trent River into New Bern, then burned the bridge so precipitately that some of their compatriots were left behind and were captured. They also burned a fire raft in the river, which soon drifted against the railroad bridge and destroyed it.
While the battle was in progress, Commander Rowan&#x27;s ships had moved up the river to assist. They received only minor damage in passing the lower barrier, and then positioned themselves to shell Fort Thompson. When the fort was abandoned, they immediately passed the second barrier and moved on to New Bern. Because Branch&#x27;s order to retreat included all of the Confederate river batteries, their guns were spiked and they were abandoned to the fleet. At the city, the fleet shelled the retreating Confederate troops, denying them the opportunity to regroup. The retreating units could not reform until they had fled all the way to Kinston. With both bridges destroyed, Burnside&#x27;s soldiers had to be ferried across the river by the gunboats.

Branch had lost 64 killed, 101 wounded, and 413 captured or missing, compared to Burnside&#x27;s 90 killed, 380 wounded, and a single man captured.

==Aftermath==
New Bern fell and was occupied. It remained in control of the Union Army for the rest of the war. Immediately following the battle, Burnside turned his attention to his next important objective, getting control of the port at Beaufort, which was defended by Fort Macon. The Rebels did not defend Morehead City, which was occupied immediately by the Yankees, or Beaufort, which was taken on 25 March. The siege of Fort Macon began at that time. As the Union captured New Bern, it meant a turning point for union control of the coast of North Carolina. The New Bern region was an important victory for the union as it created more space for camps, housing, and employment for refugees.

==Battlefield preservation==

The battlefield is preserved today as the New Bern Battlefield Site. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners, including the New Bern Historical Society, have acquired and preserved of the battlefield site as of mid-2023.

<doc id="722808" wikidata="Q2086195" url="?curid=722808" title="Philip Green">
<text>Sir Philip Nigel Ross Green (born 15 March 1952) is a British businessman who was the chairman of the retail company Arcadia Group. He owned the high street clothing retailers Topshop, Topman, and Miss Selfridge from 2002 to 2020. In May 2023, his net worth was estimated by the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; to be £910 million.

Green was the chairman and chief executive of Amber Day from 1988 to 1992. In 1999, he acquired Sears plc. He bought British Home Stores (BHS) for £200 million in 2000, and subsequently spent £840 million to acquire the Arcadia Group in 2002. Arcadia became a private company and was delisted from the London Stock Exchange. He unsuccessfully sought to acquire Marks &amp; Spencer in 1999 and 2004.

At its peak, Green&#x27;s Arcadia Group owned the clothing retailers Topshop, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit. BHS was part of Arcadia from 2009 to 2015. Arcadia had more than 2,500 outlets in the UK, concessions in UK department stores such as Debenhams and Selfridges, and several hundred franchises in other countries. After high street sales fell in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Arcadia entered administration and ASOS acquired the Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge brands in 2021.

Green was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2006 Birthday Honours. He has been called the &quot;King of the High Street&quot; but has been involved in a number of controversies during his career, including his actions prior to the demise of BHS in 2016.

==Early life==
Green was born on 15 March 1952 in Croydon, England, into a middle-class Jewish family. He was the son of Simon Green, a successful property developer and electrical goods retailer, and Alma. He has a sister, Elizabeth, five years his senior. His family moved to Hampstead Garden Suburb, a middle-class area of North London, and at the age of nine he was sent to the now-closed Jewish boarding school Carmel College in Oxfordshire.

When Green was twelve, his father died of a heart attack, and he inherited the family business. After leaving boarding school at 15 with no O-levels, Green worked for a shoe importer in East London before travelling to the US, Europe and the Far East. On his return, aged 21, he set up his first business, importing jeans from the Far East to sell on to London retailers. The business was assisted with a £20,000 loan (equivalent to £216,000 in 2014) backed by his family.

In 1979, Green bought up, at low prices, the entire stock of ten designer-label clothes retailers that had gone into receivership. He then had the newly bought clothes dry cleaned, put on hangers, and wrapped in polythene to make them look new, and bought a shop from which to sell them to the public.

==Business career==
===Amber Day===
In 1988, he became chairman and Chief Executive of a quoted company called Amber Day, a discount retailer. The shares performed well, but then suffered a series of profit downgrades and in 1992 he resigned when the company failed to meet its profit forecast.

=== Arcadia Group ===
Next, Green assisted his wife Tina Green in the purchase of the Arcadia Group, which owns High Street chains such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Outfit, Topshop/Topman and Wallis in 2002. The company was briefly owned by Green but sold to Tina Green within 24 hours, with Philip acting as CEO. On 30 November 2020, Arcadia Group went into administration after high street sales were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Charitable works and other activities==
In April 1980, Green registered a philanthropic initiative, the Kahn Charitable Trust, with a vision of &quot;putting lost smiles back on the faces of less privileged persons across the globe.&quot;

Green is a supporter of the Fashion Retail Academy and the industry charity Retail Trust. Green was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2006 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &quot;For services to the Retail Industry&quot;.

In May 2007, after the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal, Green donated £250,000 as a monetary reward for any useful public information. He also gave the McCanns the use of his private jet to allow them to fly to Rome for a Papal visit.

In 2010, Green donated $465,000 for new beds at the Royal Marsden Cancer Hospital, after his wife Tina&#x27;s mother died there. He also spent more than $150,000 for an Alexander McQueen dress at Naomi Campbell&#x27;s Fashion for Relief charity event. In the same year, Green donated £100,000 to the &quot;Evening Standard&#x27;s&quot; Dispossessed Fund which aims to support London&#x27;s poorest people.

He was reportedly the BBC&#x27;s first choice to front the UK franchise of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;; however, at that time in 2004, he was too busy with Arcadia&#x27;s attempted takeover of Marks &amp; Spencer.

==Political activity==
Two weeks prior to the 2010 general election, Green came out in support of David Cameron, George Osborne and the Conservative Party, stating that Cameron and Osborne &quot;understand what needs to be done. They get it.&quot;

In August 2010, Green was asked by Cameron, then recently elected as Prime Minister, to carry out a review of UK government spending and procurement. Green&#x27;s summary report, &quot;Efficiency Review by Sir Philip Green&quot;, published in October 2010, alleged significant failings in government procurement processes. The government published the review identifying its main finding as &quot;the Government is failing to leverage both its credit rating and its scale&quot;. Green argued that the report gave &quot;a fair reflection&quot; of government waste and inefficiency in practice, for which &quot;very poor data and process&quot; were seen as the main causes. Cameron welcomed the report, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s a good report, it will save a lot of money and it&#x27;s important we do it.&quot;

The report examined central government&#x27;s procurement practice but also noted that &quot;the whole public sector&quot; could potentially benefit from better centralised procurement.

==Personal life==
Green and his wife Cristina Palos have two children, one of whom, Brandon, was previously in a relationship with actress Emma Watson.

Green is based at a London hotel during the week, spending the weekends with his wife and their children in an apartment in Monaco. For his 50th birthday, Green flew 200 guests in a chartered Airbus A300 to a hotel in Cyprus for a three-day toga party, where Tom Jones and Rod Stewart performed. For his 55th birthday, Green flew 100 guests 8,500 miles in two private jets to the Four Seasons at Landaagiraavaru, an eco-spa on a private island in the Maldives.

Green owns a £100 million, Benetti Lionheart yacht and a £20 million Gulfstream G550 private jet. For a birthday, his wife bought him a solid gold Monopoly set, featuring his own acquisitions.

Green is inspired by Sir Charles Clore, who built the Sears plc UK retail empire from scratch in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Football==
Green is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter. In 1987 he suggested to Irving Scholar, the Spurs chairman, that Tony Berry be appointed to the board. In 1991, he helped Terry Venables raise the last £500,000 needed to purchase shares in the club. He was also involved in the transfers of Rio Ferdinand from Leeds United and Louis Saha from Fulham to Manchester United.

Green is involved with Everton Football Club due to his friendship with chairman Bill Kenwright, but states that has no intention of formally investing in the club. He arranged for another friend, Planet Hollywood&#x27;s owner Robert Earl, to purchase shares from former director Paul Gregg during a struggle for control of Everton in 2004. He offers business advice to the club alongside Tesco CEO Terry Leahy and helps negotiate player transfer fees with agents.

==Controversies==
===Tax avoidance===

Green became the target of activist group UK Uncut in November 2010 for alleged corporate tax avoidance. The group targeted Green specifically as a government advisor.

Taveta Investments, acquired by Arcadia in 2002, is registered in the name of Green&#x27;s wife. As a Monaco resident, the company faces a significantly lower tax liability than if she were a UK resident. When Green paid his family £1.2 billion in 2005, it was paid for by a loan taken out by Arcadia, cutting Arcadia&#x27;s corporation tax as interest charges on the loan were offset against profits.

====Links to Richard Caring====
In December 2014, Michelle Young accused Philip Green, Richard Caring and Simon Cowell of helping her ex-husband, businessman Scot Young, to hide assets and so avoid paying maintenance to his ex-wife and their two daughters. In February 2015, a note from HSBC bankers in Caring&#x27;s files mentioned that Philip Green&#x27;s wife Tina Green had been holding part of Caring&#x27;s assets in cash on his behalf, prompting suspicions that Caring might have funnelled profits through Tina Green to avoid paying taxes on his assets.

===Worker rights===
Arcadia has been criticised for the pay and conditions of both overseas and UK workers by anti-sweatshop groups such as Labour Behind the Label, No Sweat and the student activist network People &amp; Planet. Green denied allegations in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; made during 2007 that his firm used overseas sweatshops where workers in Mauritius were paid pitiful wages.

In 2010, Green was again accused of using sweatshops, this time by Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme. It was asserted that he was using factories in Britain in which workers were paid less than half the legal minimum wage.

===Anti-Irish outburst===
When &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper investigated a proposed takeover of Safeway in 2003, Green responded to queries about Arcadia&#x27;s accounts by insulting and swearing at the journalists, asking them &quot;Is this &quot;The Beano&quot; or &quot;The Guardian&quot;?&quot;.

Of &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s financial editor, Paul Murphy, Green said: &quot;He can&#x27;t read English. Mind you, he is a fucking Irishman.&quot; Green issued an apology to the Irish later, to prevent a customer boycott, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===Demise of BHS===

Green bought BHS for £200m in 2000, but the firm performed poorly so he sold it for just £1 in 2015. By April 2016 BHS had debts of £1.3bn, including a pensions deficit of £571m. Despite the deficit of £571m, Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. Referring to the conduct of Green, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: &quot;In this situation it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill.&quot; Simon Walker, the Director General of the Institute of Directors, described Green&#x27;s &quot;lamentable failure of behaviour&quot; which was deeply damaging to the reputation of business. He then added that he had moral responsibilities to the pension fund and a proper investigation was needed but not one that took years. It took months for the negotiation to be settled down; it ended with Green agreeing to a voluntary settlement of £363m into the scheme.

===Appearance before joint Select Committee meeting===
A few days before a scheduled joint meeting of the Business and Work and Pensions Select Committees of the House of Commons for an inquiry into the controversial sale of BHS, Green called the inquiry biased, and wrote to Frank Field, the chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, &quot;I therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry.&quot; Field pointed out that the size of the pensions deficit is a fact, not a matter of opinion, and that Parliament and not Green decides who chairs Committees.

===Knighthood===
In 2016, the House of Commons approved a motion asking the Honours Forfeiture Committee to recommend Green&#x27;s knighthood be &quot;cancelled and annulled&quot;. One hundred MPs voted in favour of the motion, the first time MPs have proposed someone be stripped of a knighthood. The vote was not binding on the government. Following his paying £363m into the BHS pension scheme in 2017, and a decision in 2018 not to ban him from being a company director, it appeared that he would not be stripped of his knighthood.

===Sexual harassment and bullying allegations===
In October 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;a leading businessman has been granted an injunction against&quot; the newspaper to stop the &quot;newspaper revealing alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff&quot;. The following day, in the House of Lords, Labour peer Peter Hain exercised parliamentary privilege to name Green as the subject of the allegations. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said that the allegations would &quot;reignite the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers. Opposition MPs, including Labour MPs Frank Field and Jess Phillips, and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, called for a revocation of Green&#x27;s knighthood.

In May 2019, Green was charged with four counts of misdemeanor assault in the US after an Arizona Pilates teacher accused him of frequently touching her inappropriately.

=== COVID-19 ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 recession, Green&#x27;s Arcadia Group closed 550 stores in the UK, furloughing 14,500 of its workers in the process. Arcadia Group publicly requested taxpayer help to cover the pay of the furloughed workers.

<doc id="722814" wikidata="Q771093" url="?curid=722814" title="Indiana State Road 37">
<text>State Road 37 (SR 37) is a major route in the U.S. state of Indiana, running as a four-lane divided highway for a majority of its course in Southern and Central Indiana.

At one time, the route ran from the southwest corner of the state to the northeast corner. In the pre-Interstate Highway era, SR 37 was the most direct route between Fort Wayne and Indianapolis. Interstate 69 (I-69) has supplanted it as a through route, and SR 37 now consists of three disconnected segments, with the segment through Indianapolis being replaced entirely by I-69 in 2024. The longer segment starts at Tell City on the Ohio River and ends in Bloomington in south central Indiana. Another shorter segment resumes off I-69 and runs northeast to SR 9 in Marion. The other segment in northeastern Indiana runs from I-469 near Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line.

== Route description ==

=== Southern segment ===
The southern segment of SR 37 begins at a junction with SR 66 near the Ohio River in Tell City. Angling northeast, it enters the Hoosier National Forest then turns north until it meets I-64 just north of SR 62 at St. Croix. SR 37 now continues north beyond I-64, to eventually meet SR 64 near Eckerty. These two routes then run concurrently to the east for about , where just north of English SR 37 departs to the north toward Paoli and SR 64 continues east toward Marengo. Just prior to reaching Paoli SR 37 leaves the National Forest. Once in town the route has a very brief (two-block) concurrency with US 150 and SR 56 to loop around the town square before it leaves to the north, heading for Orleans and Mitchell.

Until reaching Mitchell, SR 37 is a two-lane rural route with relatively light traffic. However, from this point north to Bloomington, the character of the road changes to become a major rural arterial route. At Mitchell the four-lane divided highway begins with a short concurrency of SR 60 on SR 37 as both routes skirt the edge of town. From there, SR 37 continues north to US 50 on the outskirts of Bedford. US 50 and SR 37 then run concurrently, curving northeast to cross the East Fork of the White River before turning north to bypass the center of the city on its west side. After US 50 leaves to the east, SR 37 proceeds northward to Bloomington, where it now meets up with I-69 to the southwest just outside of that city. This interchange marks the northern terminus of the southern segment.

The portions of SR 37 between Tell City and I-64, and from Paoli to Bedford, were designated as the Frank O&#x27;Bannon Highway, to honor the late former governor, following his death in 2003. Between the two SR 37 segments, the O&#x27;Bannon Highway designation follows SR 145, SR 56 and US 150 past Patoka Lake, through French Lick and West Baden Springs to Paoli.

=== Central segment ===
SR 37 resumes as a four-lane freeway off exit 205 of I-69 in Fishers and heads northward. It has a few interchanges with local roads before the freeway segment ends north of 146th Street. SR 37 then passes just east of Noblesville, meeting SR 32 and SR 38 before leaving Noblesville proper.

Northeast of Noblesville, SR 37 reverts to a two-lane rural highway. Along the Hamilton—Madison county line, it runs concurrently with SR 13 until those routes split just south of Elwood. From there, SR 37 angles north-northeast to reach the northern terminus of the central segment at SR 9 just south of Marion.

=== Northern segment ===
The northern segment of SR 37 begins at a junction with I-469 on the northeast side of Fort Wayne. From there it runs northeast approximately , passing through Harlan, to terminate at the Ohio state line near the Allen–DeKalb county line. The road continues northeast in Ohio as State Route 2, to Hicksville, Ohio and beyond.

== History ==

=== Southern segment ===
SR 37 was once a section of the Dixie Highway from Indianapolis to Paoli.

In the 1950s, SR 37 ran north of Bloomington on the roads now called Cascades Drive and Old 37 to the northern end of Monroe County. South of Bloomington, SR 37 followed Walnut Street Pike, Fairfax Road, Valley Mission Road, Guthrie Road, and Kentucky Hollow Road (Old 37) to Oolitic. These were replaced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the straighter sections called College Avenue and Walnut Street north of Bloomington and the sections called Walnut Street and Old 37 (Kentucky Hollow Road) south to Oolitic. As soon as the current four-lane SR 37 was finished in 1976, a portion of Kentucky Hollow Road was abandoned north of Oolitic and a stone quarry that was alongside SR 37 for years consumed the road.

SR 37 now turns to the east and is concurrent with SR 64 from Eckerty to English, where it exits the eastbound highway and rejoins the old route. The old, winding stretch of 37 from I-64 at exit 86 north to English has been designated as SR 237. Between 2009 and 2014, this change also eliminated the SR 37 concurrency with I-64 between that route&#x27;s exits 79 and 86.

=== Bloomington to Indianapolis ===
Before 2024, SR 37 ran continuously from the northern end of the southern segment at I-69 southwest of Bloomington north to the Indianapolis area. This segment was gradually upgraded and reopened with Interstate Highway standards, with I-69 gradually extended concurrently along SR 37. After completing this segment of I-69 in August 2024, SR 37 signage was removed, truncating it and splitting it further into three disconnected segments.

=== Indianapolis ===

SR 37 originally ended at the junction of SR 35 (SR 135) and US 31 at Meridian and South Streets downtown. The route that became SR 37 was initially numbered SR 13 in Marion and most of Hamilton Counties. SR 13 began at Meridian and Michigan Streets, then the junction of US 31, SR 13, and SR 367.

SR 13 followed Meridian St. (US 31) north to Fall Creek Parkway N. Drive, where it turned northeast. SR 13 then followed Fall Creek and Allisonville Road to Strawtown in Hamilton County, where what is now SR 37 was undesignated until 1940. In 1940, the portion from north of Strawtown to south of Elwood was made part of SR 13. From south of Elwood to Marion, the road now SR 37 was numbered SR 15. By 1945, the entire route described above became a continuation of SR 37 from the south side of Indianapolis. SR 37 was designated along Michigan Street (westbound) and Vermont Street (eastbound) from Meridian Street to West Street (at the time US 36, SR 29, and SR 67). SR 37 then turned south on West Street until it became Bluff Road, which was already part of SR 37. (This also removed the Bluff Road section of SR 37 from the state road system, removing the connection with SR 135.)

In 1953, the state rerouted SR 37 to overlap US 36/SR 67 along 38th Street starting at Fall Creek Parkway. (This would be part of the route the road would follow until decommissioning in 1999 or 2000.) The three roads would be multiplexed from 38th and Fall Creek, to 38th and Northwestern Avenue (now Dr. MLK Jr. Street), then south along Northwestern Avenue and West Street until the above-mentioned location at Michigan and West streets.

In 1957, construction was started on the Noblesville Bypass of SR 37. This bypass was designed to go to the east side of Noblesville, through Fishers, and along a newly constructed road in Marion County to connect to Fall Creek Parkway just north of the then route of SR 37 (Allisonville Road). One of the &quot;quirks&quot; in the design of the new SR 37 was a five-point intersection with SR 100, at the corner of Shadeland Road (now Avenue) and 82nd Street. By 1958, SR 37&#x27;s Noblesville bypass was completed to the junction with SR 100 from the north. SR 37 then was rerouted along 82nd Street to Allisonville, where it turned south to connect to Fall Creek Parkway has it had for the previous 35 years. By 1959, the new route was completed, and the Allisonville Road route was renumbered SR 37A.

In the early to mid-1960s, two changes were made to SR 37. One which would eventually become part of I-69: interchanges were built at SR 100 and 116th Street, as well as a connection to the under construction I-465. The second was the construction of an exit ramp (now exit 4) on I-465 for the eventual construction of a Bluff Road bypass through southern Marion and northern Johnson Counties.

In 1967, there were two SR 37s on the south side of Indianapolis: one along Bluff Road and one along the Bluff Road bypass. The two did not directly connect at all. By 1969, SR 37 was multiplexed with US 31 (along Meridian, North, Pennsylvania/Delaware, Madison and East streets) to I-465/I-74 at what is now exit 2. The route was multiplexed with I-465/I-74 between exits 2 and 4. This caused the Bluff Road route to be abandoned in its connections to the state road system, so it was decommissioned. Some unofficial maps listed Bluff Road as SR 37A for some time after this, although the state of Indiana never recognized it as such.

By 1972, I-69 was completed along the SR 37 corridor from I-465 to where it had ended to that point at the junction with SR 37 Noblesville bypass (now exit 205).

SR 37 stayed much the same until 1999 or 2000 when all state and US highway designations were completely removed from inside the I-465 loop. SR 37 was then officially rerouted along I-465 along Indianapolis&#x27;s east and south sides. The interchanges for SR 37 from I-465 were exit 4 and exit 37.

In August 2024, SR 37 was removed entirely from the Indianapolis area, as I-69 had largely replaced it south of Indianapolis. SR 37 used to run on what is now I-69 until just south of exit 162, just south of I-465, before turning slightly northeastward to meet I-465 at exit 4. It then routed eastwards along the eastern half of I-465 to exit 37, splitting concurrently with I-69 and following I-69 before meeting with the southern terminus of the central segment, where it splits off at exit 205 like it does today.

=== Central and northern segments ===
In 1940, the section of SR 37 from its current northern junction with SR 13 to Marion (west of its current routing) was designated SR 15. Another section that was to become SR 37, from Fort Wayne northeast to the Ohio border, was already designated SR 14.

By 1945, SR 37 had been routed along its current route from Rigdon to the south of Marion to the junction of SR 9. SR 37 was then overlapped along SR 9 from that junction to Huntington, then with US 24 from Huntington to Fort Wayne. The state then moved SR 14 from what became SR 37 to what was SR 230.

In Fort Wayne, the combined US 24/SR 37 followed Upper Huntington Road (now Jefferson Boulevard) until it met with SR 14 at Illinois Road. Just beyond that junction, the three routes split into a one-way pair, with Jefferson Boulevard and Maumee Avenue handling eastbound traffic and Washington Boulevard used for westbound travel. East of downtown, SR 37 departed the pairing with US 24/SR 14, turning north onto Anthony Boulevard to cross the Maumee River. Roughly later, the route turned northeast onto Crescent Avenue, which becomes Stellhorn Road at Hobson Road/St. Joe Road as it curves to run due east. Finally, SR 37 turned (later curved) onto Maysville Road, angling northeast again and then passing where an interchange would eventually be built with the I-469 beltway (where the north segment of this state road now begins).

In the 1970s, an expansion of the Anthony Boulevard section to four lanes was planned; this was successfully lobbied against by the North Anthony Neighborhood Association.

By 1980, the official multiplex along SR 9 and US 24 was decommissioned (although there is a reference to SR 37 being multiplexed along I-69 around the west side of Fort Wayne in 1980, that reference was gone by 1982). This created the northern section of SR 37, with its origin point located at Crescent Avenue and Coliseum Boulevard (then US 30, now SR 930) in Fort Wayne. When I-469 was completed, the mileage between Coliseum Boulevard and I-469 was decommissioned and returned to local control.

To improve traffic flow along SR 37 north of where it branches off I-69, the communities of Fishers and Nobleville started a project to reconstruct drainage lines and remove five signalized intersections. Work on the drainage lines was started in September 2018 and completed by February 2020 while the 135th Street intersection was converted to a pair of right-in/right-outs. The other four intersections are to be converted into interchanges and will be completed in phases. Phase three converted the East 146th Street intersection into a single-point urban interchange while phases one and three converted the intersections at East 126th Street and East 131st Street to dogbone interchanges. These phases were completed by September 2022. In January 2023, pre-construction on the final phase, which will change the 141st Street intersection to a dogbone interchange, changed the intersection to right-in/right-out to improve traffic flow. A timeline for construction of the interchange was to be provided once project bids are made in summer 2023, and was tentatively scheduled to begin in September 2023 and be completed by October 2025. However, the cost of construction and labor rose due to other construction projects in central Indiana, and the bid process was delayed by six months. Construction is now not expected to begin until summer 2024.

State Road 37A (SR 37A) ran from Indianapolis to Noblesville from 1959 until the 1970s. Beginning sometime between 1957 and 1959, the designation SR  37A was first used for the old routing of SR 37 between Indianapolis and Noblesville. The southern end of the road was moved to SR 100 in late 1963 or early 1964. In late 1964 or early 1965 the route was shortened at the north end, with the new end being at an intersection with SR 32 and SR 38. In late 1969 or early 1970 the designation of SR 37A in Hamilton County was removed. The state highway commission removed the last segment of SR 37A in Marion County in either late 1972 or early 1973.

SR 37A (Allisonville Road) began at its southern terminus with its parent route, SR 37 (now Binford Boulevard), near the Indiana State Fairgrounds. The route traveled northeast crossing 52nd and 56th streets, Kessler Boulevard East Drive, and 62nd, 65th, 71st, 75th, and 79th streets, before it reached an intersection with East 82nd Street near Castleton Square Mall. The route then interchanged with Interstate 465 (I-465 exit 35), followed by intersections with 86th, 91st, and 96th streets, then crossed into Hamilton County and the town of Fishers.

In Fishers, the route intersected East 106th Street near Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport. The route intersected 116th, 126th, and 131st streets, then passed by Conner Prairie Interactive History Park. The route then crossed 141st and 146th streets, entering the city of Noblesville. Just south of downtown Noblesville, Allisonville Road turned north and becomes South 10th Street. In downtown, the route reached an intersection with SR 32/SR 38 (Conner Street). North of downtown, the route once again turned northeast and became Allisonville Road. The route then intersected East 191st Street. After East 191st Street, the route turned east and crossed Cumberland Road. After Cumberland Road, the route turned southeast and reached its northern terminus at its parent route, SR 37 (Strawtown Pike) on the far north side of Noblesville.

<text>Nicholas Rackard (28 April 1922 – 10 April 1976) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career with the Wexford senior team spanned seventeen years from 1940 to 1957. He established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game.

Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by his father who had hoped he would become a cricketer. His uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for.

Rackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran&#x27;s College in Kilkenny. Here he won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne&#x27;s club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club&#x27;s senior team, he won four county senior championship medals.

Rackard made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Wexford minor panel. He was just out of the minor grade when he was selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. He also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. He played his last game for Wexford in August 1957.

By the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of his career and he claimed his sole Railway Cup medal in 1956.

Rackard&#x27;s brothers, Billy and Bobby, also experienced All-Ireland success with Wexford.

In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, he helped the team secure the All-Ireland title.

Rackard was most famous for his scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of his retirement from hurling. His private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during his university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the &quot;Irish Press&quot; in 1975, he detailed his life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard&#x27;s death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community. He was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984, however, he was sensationally omitted from the Hurling Team of the Millennium in favour of Ray Cummins.

==Early life==
Nickey Rackard was born in Killanne, County Wexford in 1922. The eldest son in a family of five boys and four girls. His parents were Robert (Bob) Rackard and Anastasia Doran, who had been married in 1918. He was born into a family that was mildly interested in sport. His granduncle had played with the famous Wexford football team that captured four All-Ireland titles in-a-row between 1915 and 1918. Rackard&#x27;s father Bob had planned that his son would play cricket, however, young Rackard was much more interested in Gaelic games. He was educated locally and later attended St. Kierans College, Kilkenny, a virtual academy for young hurling talent. Rackard later attended University College Dublin where he studied to be a veterinary surgeon. In all, his studies took eight years to complete because of his huge commitment to his sporting exploits.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Rackard played his club hurling with his local Rathnure club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1948. It was Rathnure&#x27;s first-ever championship triumph. Two years later in 1950, Rackard captured a second county title, a victory which allowed him to take over the captaincy of the county senior team for the following year. He won his third and final county medal in 1955.

===Inter-county===
Rackard&#x27;s early successes on the inter-county scene were as a footballer with the Wexford team. At the time the county&#x27;s hurling team was in the doldrums, however, things were about to change. Rackard made his debut for the county team in 1940 and spent much of the decade at midfield. By the start of the 1950s, he had moved into the forward lines and it was here that he captured his first Leinster title in 1951. Wexford later faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, a team that was attempting to capture a third championship title in a row. The game itself saw Rackard give a remarkable display of hurling artistry; however, Tipp&#x27;s forward line ran riot and scored seven goals. The final score of 7–7 to 3–9 tells its own story.

Wexford lost their Leinster crown in 1952, however, two years later in 1954 Wexford regained the title following a huge victory over Dublin. That game saw Rackard score a grand total of five goals and five points from Wexford&#x27;s tally of 8–5. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Wexford face Antrim. Once again, Rackard ran riot in the forward line and amassed a personal tally of seven goals and seven points. A 12–17 to 2–3 victory gave Wexford an easy passage to the championship decider where they faced Cork. On this occasion &#x27;the Rebels&#x27; were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland title on the trot and a record crowd turned out in Croke Park to see Rackard and Christy Ring do battle. In the end, it was Johnny Clifford who turned out to be the hero as Cork won the day on a score line of 1–9 to 1–6.

In 1955 Rackard won his third Leinster title, however, an All-Ireland medal still eluded his collection. Wexford later defeated Limerick in the All-Ireland semi-final before later facing Galway in the championship decider. At half-time the men from the West led by 2–5 to 2–3, however, a Tim Flood goal nine minutes from full-time gave Wexford a deserved 3–13 to 2–8 win. It was the county&#x27;s first championship title since 1910 and it was Rackard&#x27;s first All-Ireland medal. In 1956 Wexford captured their first National Hurling League title and breezed through the provincial championship once again with Rackard collecting his fourth Leinster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Wexford aiming to retain their title and gain revenge over Cork for the defeat in 1954. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classics as Christy Ring was bidding for a ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliothar up the field to set up another attack. Rackard scored a crucial goal with two minutes to go giving Wexford a 2–14 to 2–8 victory. In spite of Cork&#x27;s loss Wexford&#x27;s Nick O&#x27;Donnell and Bobby Rackard, in an unparalleled display of sportsmanship in any game, raised Christy Ring onto their shoulders and carried him off the field. Wexford had won the game but there was no doubt in their minds that the real hero was Ring. After defeat in the Leinster final of 1957 Nicky Rackard decided to retire from inter-county hurling.

===Inter-provincial===
By the late 1940s, Rackard had become a key feature on the Leinster team that participated in the annual Railway Cup inter-provincial series. Munster dominated the competition at this time; however, he captured his sole Railway Cup title in 1956.

==Post-playing career==
Rackard&#x27;s personal life away from the hurling pitch was a deeply troubled one, marred by excessive drinking. His problems with alcohol began while he was studying to be a veterinary surgeon in Dublin. In 1951 he suddenly gave up alcohol in a pledge not to drink again after a friend, who was a priest, died. When Wexford celebrated All-Ireland success in 1955 and 1956 Rackard was a teetotaller. During a visit to New York in 1957, however, Rackard began drinking again and the habit grew progressively worse over the next 12 years. In 1965, then a serious alcoholic, he had his first period of hospitalisation to treat the illness. At that stage he was drinking daily, however, the treatment didn&#x27;t work. He finally quit by 1970 after joining Alcoholics Anonymous. When Rackard quit drinking for the final time he was practically broke. He pieced his life together again, rebuilt his veterinary practice and indulged his passion for horses, enjoying wins in point-to-points and other major race events.

With the AA he travelled the country helping people who were troubled by alcohol. In February 1974 Rackard noticed strange lumps on his neck which he had later removed. Later that year he was told he needed another operation and was said to be making good progress. In 1975 he spoke out in the &quot;Irish Press&quot; newspaper about his alcoholism, becoming one of the first people to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Shortly after this, it was revealed that the cancer that had previously troubled him had unfortunately not been completely annihilated and had returned. Rackard died at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Dublin in 1976 and was universally mourned by the GAA community throughout Ireland.

==Recognition==

Nickey Rackard is generally regarded as perhaps one of the greatest hurlers of all time. He was personally honoured by being posthumously named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984. He was not named on the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000, with the full-forward position going to Cork&#x27;s Ray Cummins. His scoring prowess has also earned Rackard a place on the top ten list of all-time scoring greats. In 2005 the GAA further honoured Rackard by naming the Nicky Rackard Cup, the hurling competition for Division 3 teams, in his honour.

In 2006, a Wexford author, Tom Williams, wrote a long-overdue biography of Rackard entitled &quot;Cuchulainn&#x27;s Son – The Story of Nickey Rackard&quot;. The same author also penned a now well-known song about Rackard many years earlier. It too was called &quot;Cuchulainn&#x27;s Son&quot; and has been recorded by various artists over the last 20 years and is a lament for the great sportsman.

In Wexford town, there is a statue to commemorate Rackard, erected in 2012.

<text>Musala ( ); from Arabic through Ottoman Turkish: from &quot;Musalla&quot;, &quot;near God&quot; or &quot;place for prayer&quot; is the highest peak in the Rila Mountains, as well as in Bulgaria and the entire Balkan Peninsula, standing at .

With a topographic prominence of , Musala is also the 6th highest peak by topographic prominence in mainland Europe. It is also the 3rd most topographically isolated major peak in Continental Europe.

Musala is situated within the Rila National Park, which is noted for its rich flora, including species such as Macedonian Pine and Bulgarian Fir in the forests on its middle slopes, and fauna; it is one of the easiest places in Europe to see the wallcreeper. All major mountain ranges of Bulgaria can be seen from the top; these include Vitosha to the northwest, Sredna Gora towards the northeast, the Balkan Mountains along most of the northern horizon behind Vitosha and Sredna Gora, the Rhodope Mountains to the southeast, Pirin to the south, Osogovo and Ruy Mountain to the west, and of course, the rest of Rila.

A cosmic ray station was built on the peak in 1960 with cooperation from the Hungarian Academy of Science. The station conducted scientific experiments using a muon telescope. The station was destroyed by an electrical fire on October 29, 1983.

With an average annual temperature of -2.2 °C, Musala is the coldest place in Bulgaria and the entire Balkan Peninsula. Temperatures stay below 0 °C for about 8 months each year. Due to this, about 45% of the annual precipitation on Musala is snow, and snow cover lasts for about 200 days (more than six months). Three of the main rivers of Bulgaria, the Iskar, Maritsa and Mesta have their sources near Musala.

The next highest peaks in the vicinity of Musala are Malka (Little) Musala () and Irechek ().

== Climate ==
Musala has an alpine climate with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Usually, through winter, the temperatures do not exceed the freezing point for months. Snow cover lasts for about 8–9 months. Through the summer, temperatures rarely go above 14-15C. The summer season only lasts for 2 months, and snowfalls are possible. For the period 1931–2013, the highest recorded temperature was , and the lowest - . The average annual temperature is , which makes the peak the coldest place in Bulgaria.

==Namesakes==
Musala Glacier on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Musala Peak.

<doc id="722824" wikidata="Q157575" url="?curid=722824" title="University of Strasbourg">
<text>The University of Strasbourg (, Unistra) is a public research university located in Strasbourg, France, with over 52,000 students and 3,300 researchers. Founded in the 16th century by Johannes Sturm, it was an intellectual hotbed during the Age of Enlightenment.

The old university was split into three separate entities during the 1970s, before they merged back together in 2009. The University of Strasbourg is currently composed of 35 academic faculties, schools and institutes, plus 71 research laboratories spread over six campuses, including the historic site in the Neustadt.

Throughout its existence, Unistra alumni, faculty, or researchers have included 18 Nobel laureates, two Fields Medalists and a wide range of notable individuals in their respective fields. Among them are Goethe, statesman Robert Schuman, historian Marc Bloch and several chemists such as Louis Pasteur.

==History==

The university emerged from a Lutheran humanist German Gymnasium, founded in 1538 by Johannes Sturm in the Free Imperial City of Strassburg. It was transformed to a university in 1621 () and elevated to the ranks of a royal university in 1631. Among its earliest university students was Johann Scheffler who studied medicine and later converted to Catholicism and became the mystic and poet Angelus Silesius.

The Lutheran German university still persisted even after the annexation of the city by King Louis XIV in 1681 (one famous student was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1770/71), but mainly turned into a French speaking university during the French Revolution.

The university was refounded as the German &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität&quot; in 1872, after the Franco-Prussian war and the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany provoked a westwards exodus of Francophone teachers. During the German Empire the university was greatly expanded and numerous new buildings were erected because the university was intended to be a showcase of German against French culture in Alsace. In 1918, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, so a reverse exodus of Germanophone teachers took place.

During the Second World War, when France was occupied, personnel and equipment of the University of Strasbourg were transferred to Clermont-Ferrand. In its place, the short-lived German Reichsuniversität Straßburg was created.

In 1971, the university was subdivided into three separate institutions:
* Louis Pasteur University (Strasbourg I)
* Marc Bloch University (Strasbourg II)
* Robert Schuman University (Strasbourg III)

Following a national reform of higher education, these universities merged on 1 January 2009, and the new institution became one of the first French universities to benefit from greater autonomy.

== Buildings ==

The university campus covers a vast part near the center of the city, located between the &quot;Cité Administrative&quot;, &quot;Esplanade&quot; and &quot;Gallia&quot; bus-tram stations.

Modern architectural buildings include: Escarpe, the Doctoral College of Strasbourg, Supramolecular Science and Engineering Institute (ISIS), Atrium, Pangloss, PEGE (Pôle européen de gestion et d&#x27;économie) and others. The student residence building for the Doctoral College of Strasbourg was designed by London-based Nicholas Hare Architects in 2007. The structures are depicted on the main inner wall of the Esplanade university restaurant, accompanied by the names of their architects and years of establishment.

The administrative organisms, attached to the university (Prefecture; CAF, LMDE, MGEL—health insurance; SNCF—national French railway company; CTS—Strasbourg urban transportation company), are located in the &quot;Agora&quot; building.

<text>The Université Robert Schuman, also known as Strasbourg III or URS, was a university in Strasbourg, Alsace, France. In 2007, there were nearly 10,000 students enrolled at the university, including more than 1,500 foreign students. The university tended to teach and research in fields such as law, politics and international relations. This university also included three &quot;grande écoles&quot;, the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Strasbourg&quot;, the &quot;Institut Européen d&#x27;Etudes Commerciales Supérieures de Strasbourg&quot; (IECS), and the Centre Universitaire d&#x27;Enseignement du Journalisme (CUEJ). The &quot;Université Robert Schuman&quot; was named after the politician Robert Schuman, not to be confused with composer Robert Schumann.

On 1 January 2009, Robert Schuman University became part of the refounded University of Strasbourg and lost its status as an independent university.

<text>A Tuohy (/tOO-ee/) needle is a hollow hypodermic needle, very slightly curved at the end, suitable for inserting epidural catheters.

== Epidural needle ==

Literally, an epidural needle is simply a needle that is placed into the epidural space. To provide continuous epidural analgesia or anesthesia, a small hollow catheter may be threaded through the epidural needle into the epidural space, and left there while the needle is removed. There are multiple types of epidural needles as well as catheters, but in modern practice in developed nations, disposable materials are used to ensure sterility.

Epidural needles are designed with a curved tip to help prevent puncture of the dural membrane. But following accidental dural puncture, headache occurs in up to 85% of patients causing significant perioperative morbidity. However, in case of inadvertent dural perforation, the incidence of headache can be lowered by identifying the epidural space with the needle bevel oriented parallel to the longitudinal dural fibers which limits the size of the subsequent dural tear.

===Types===
Types of epidural needles include:
* The Crawford Needle
* The Tuohy Needle
* The Hustead Needle
* The Weiss Needle
* The Sprotte Spezial Needle
* Other Epidural Needles : Other less popular types are the Wagner needle (1957), the Cheng needle(1958), the Crawley needle (1968), the Foldes needle (1973), and the Bell needle (1975)—all variants of the Huber design with a blunted tip of varying sharpness.
* Variants like the Brace needle, a Crawford variant; the Lutz epidural needle (1963), with a pencil-point design for single-shot epidural use; the Scott needle (1985), a Tuohy needle with a Luer lock hub; and the Eldor needle (1993), designed for use with combined spinal epidural anesthesia.

== History ==
Though Ralph L. Huber (1915–2006), a Seattle dentist, was the inventor of this needle in 1940, it is known in the name of Edward Boyce Tuohy (1908–1959), a 20th-century U.S anesthesiologist who first popularized it in 1945.

<text>U.S. Highway 16 (US 16) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway between Rapid City, South Dakota, and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is at a junction with Interstate 90 (I-90)/US 14, concurrent with I-190, in Rapid City. The western terminus is the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park, concurrent with US 14 and US 20. US 16 used to extend all the way to Michigan but has been truncated in favor of I-90 and I-96.

==Route description==

|}
===Wyoming===
US 16 begins at the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park, along with US 14 and the eastern segment of US 20. From the park, the three highways run concurrently to Cody and Greybull. In Greybull, US 14 splits off to the east, while US 16/US 20 heads due south to Basin and Worland. In Worland, US 16 splits off from US 20 and heads east over Powder River Pass on its way to the city of Buffalo. After passing Buffalo, US 16 arches north to the community of Ucross, meeting US 14 again, before arching back south to Gillette. US 16 then runs east concurrently with I-90 between Gillette and Moorcroft before heading southeast to the towns of Upton and Newcastle. The highway then heads east to the South Dakota state line. For most of the way through the state, the highway is a two-lane road.

===South Dakota===

US 16 is also known as Mount Rushmore Road in western South Dakota. From the state line, the highway travels near Jewel Cave, the third-longest cave in the world. The highway goes through the city of Custer and shares alignment with US 385. East of Hill City, US 16 splits off US 385. It then becomes a four-lane divided highway, with the two roadways separated by up to a half-mile () in some places, including the old gold-mining town of Rockerville, which is contained entirely between the two roadways. In Rapid City, a truck bypass runs along Catron Boulevard and Elk Vale Road up to exit 61 on I-90.

The South Dakota section of US 16 is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-138.

==History==

US 16 originally connected Detroit with Yellowstone National Park, including a ferry link across Lake Michigan between Muskegon, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In Michigan, the route was in use long before automobiles and was known to white settlers as the Grand River Road, and prior to the designation of U.S. Highways in 1926, had been designated as M-16 in the 1920s from Detroit to south of Muskegon. In 1938, reflectorized discs were placed on US 16 every from Detroit to Lansing, resulting in fewer nighttime traffic accidents. Other states would later do the same on their roads.

US 16 initially crossed the South Dakota–Wyoming state line west of Spearfish. U.S. Highway 216 (US 216) was commissioned in 1930 as a loop off US 16 to the south between Rapid City and Moorcroft, crossing the state line west of Custer. In 1934, US 16 was moved to the US 216 alignment, while the former US 16 became part of an extension of US 14.

In Michigan, most of US 16 was superseded by I-96 and a segment of Grand River Avenue in Detroit ultimately became M-5. US 16 was later decommissioned in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and eastern South Dakota to its present termini.

Between Rapid City and Dexter, Minnesota, it has been supplanted by I-90. In Faribault County, Minnesota, the highway took on another number as there was already a county highway numbered 16. Residents of the county continued referring to the road as &quot;16&quot; or &quot;old 16&quot; and eventually the county renumbered it as County Road 16 (CR 16). From the county&#x27;s western border with Martin County, US 16 continued east through the city of Blue Earth as part of 1st Street and Leland Parkway until it briefly combines with US 169/Grove Street. south of that point at the intersection of Grove and 7th streets, CR 16 followed 7th Street and continued east to the border of Freeborn County. Most of the stretch through Faribault County was a relatively narrow two-lane highway with wide gravel shoulders that has been widened at least two times since US 16 was decommissioned. East of Dexter, it is now Minnesota State Highway 16 and State Trunk Highway 16 in Wisconsin. In South Dakota, it was replaced by various state highways (including South Dakota Highway 38, or SD 38, and SD 248) and county roads: generally, in West River, the old alignment was transferred to county responsibility entirely, while, in East River, it remained a state-maintained highway.

An older US 16A in South Dakota has become SD 240.

In South Dakota in 2009, the South Dakota Department of Transportation designated US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial, now being carved in the Black Hills, as the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. This segment of US 385 is also a part of the George Hearst Memorial Highway.

<text>Santa Maria de Jetibá is the name of a municipality in central Espírito Santo, Southeastern Brazil. It was founded in 1857 by Pomeranian immigrants who arrived through the state capital Vitória by going up the river Santa Maria.

==Geography==
Located in the south-central mountain region of Espírito Santo, this municipality has an area of 735.55 square kilometers. The town of Santa Maria de Jetibá is 720 meters above sea level, and the highest point in the state is Garrafão Peak, at 1200 meters (3937 ft) above sea level.

==People==
With a total population of 41,015 (2020), Santa Maria de Jetibá is considered one of the last significant East Pomeranian-speaking communities in the world. Those immigrants (Pomeranians), who came from the historical region Pomerania, now part of Germany and Poland where it is known as Pommern and Pomorze respectively.

In Brazil, many Pomeranians also established communities in Santa Catarina (see Pomerode) and Rio Grande do Sul (see Arroio do Padre). Santa Maria de Jetibá is a place where the people still speak solely East Pomeranian in their day-to-day life. Due to the isolation of this community, most of the members of the community live in very poor conditions. Due also to financial constraints by the state, very little investment in education is forthcoming, and the language barrier persists to be a real problem for the community. This also hinders their future prospects, of course, by them not having proper education, thus a reasonable expectation in the work market. Those communities are mainly rural.

===Demography===
Most of the population of this city is descended from Pomeranian and German peoples.
 East Pomeranian, a dialect of Low German, has co-official status in Santa Maria de Jetibá.
&quot;Source: 2010 Census&quot;

==Climate==

Santa Maria de Jetibá is in a high valley and the altitude is about 700m above sea level. The elevation of this municipality influences the climate which features a cool and dry winter, while there are wet and hot days with cool nights in summer. Santa Maria de Jetibá features a humid subtropical climate type Cwa.

<doc id="722856" wikidata="Q679989" url="?curid=722856" title="Complex (psychology)">
<text>A complex is a structure in the unconscious that is objectified as an underlying theme—like a power or a status—by grouping clusters of emotions, memories, perceptions and wishes in response to a threat to the stability of the self. In psychoanalysis, it is antithetical to drives.

== Overview ==

An example of a complex would be as follows: if a person had a leg amputated as a child, this would influence the person&#x27;s life in profound ways, even upon overcoming the physical handicap. The person may have many thoughts, emotions, memories, feelings of inferiority, triumphs, bitterness, and determinations centering on that one aspect of life. If these thoughts were troubling and pervasive, Jung might say the person had a &quot;complex&quot; about the leg.

The reality of complexes is widely agreed upon in the area of depth psychology, a branch of psychology asserting that the vast majority of the personality is determined and influenced by unconscious processes. Complexes are common features of the psychic landscape, according to Jung&#x27;s accounting of the psyche, and often become relevant in psychotherapy to examine and resolve, most especially in the journey toward individuation or wholeness. Without resolution, complexes continue to exert unconscious, maladaptive influence on our thoughts, feelings, and behavior and keep us from achieving psychological integration.

== History and development of the idea ==

Carl Jung distinguished between two types of unconscious mind: the personal unconscious and collective unconscious. The personal unconscious was the accumulation of experiences from a person&#x27;s lifetime that could not be consciously recalled. The collective unconscious, on the other hand, was a sort of universal inheritance of human beings, a &quot;species memory&quot; passed on to each of us, not unlike the motor programs and instincts of other animals. Jung believed the personal unconscious was dominated by complexes.

The term &quot;complex&quot; (; also &quot;emotionally charged complexes&quot; or &quot;feeling-toned complex of ideas&quot;), was coined by Carl Jung when he was still a close associate of Sigmund Freud. Complexes were so central to Jung&#x27;s ideas that he originally called his body of theories &quot;Complex psychology&quot;. Historically the term originated with Theodor Ziehen, a German psychiatrist who experimented with reaction time in word association test responses. Jung described a complex as a node in the unconscious; it may be imagined as a knot of unconscious feelings and beliefs, detectable indirectly, through behavior that is puzzling or hard to account for.

Jung developed his theory regarding complexes very early in his career through the word association tests conducted at the Burghölzli, the psychiatric clinic of Zurich University, where he worked from 1900 to 1908. In the word association tests, a researcher would read a list of 100 words to a subject, who was asked to say, as quickly as possible, the first thing that came to mind in response to each word, and the subject&#x27;s reaction time was measured in fifths of a second. (Sir Francis Galton invented the method in 1879.) Researchers noted any unusual reactions—hesitations, slips of the tongue, signs of emotion. Jung was interested in patterns he detected in subjects&#x27; responses, hinting at unconscious feelings and beliefs.

In Jung&#x27;s theory, complexes may be conscious, partly conscious, or unconscious. As well, complexes can be positive or negative, resulting in good or bad consequences. There are many kinds of them, but at the core of any complex is a universal pattern of experience, or archetype. Two of the major complexes Jung wrote about were the anima (a node of unconscious beliefs and feelings in a man&#x27;s psyche relating to the opposite gender) and animus (the corresponding complex in a woman&#x27;s psyche). Other major complexes include the mother, father, hero, and more recently, the brother and sister. Jung believed it was perfectly normal to have complexes because everyone has emotional experiences that affect the psyche. Although they are normal, negative complexes can cause us pain and suffering.

One of the key differences between Jungian and Freudian theory is that Jung&#x27;s thought posits several different kinds of complex. Freud only focused on the Oedipus complex which reflected developmental challenges that face every young boy. He did not take other complexes into account except for the Electra complex, which he briefly spoke of.

After years of working together, Jung broke from Freud, due to disagreements in their ideas, and they each developed their own theories. Jung wanted to distinguish between his and Freud&#x27;s findings, so he named his theory &quot;analytical psychology&quot;.

==Jung&#x27;s theory of complexes with key citations==

The ego itself can be thought of as a complex, not yet fully integrated with other parts of the psyche (namely, the superego and the id, or unconscious). As described by Jung, &quot;by ego I understand a complex of ideas which constitutes the center of my field of consciousness and appears to possess a high degree of continuity and identity. Hence I also speak of an ego-complex&quot;.

Jung often used the term &quot;complex&quot; to describe a partially repressed, yet highly influential cluster of charged psychic material split off from, or at odds with, the conscious &quot;I&quot;. Daniels described complexes in 2010 as &quot;&#x27;stuck-together&#x27; agglomerations of thoughts, feelings, behavior patterns, and somatic forms of expression&quot;. Concerning its nature as feeling-toned, Jung wrote &quot;[a complex] is the image of a certain psychic situation which is strongly accentuated emotionally and is, moreover, incompatible with the habitual attitude of consciousness. This image has a powerful inner coherence, it has its own wholeness and, in addition, a relatively high degree of autonomy, so that it is subject to the control of the conscious mind to only a limited extent, and therefore behaves like an animated foreign body in the sphere of consciousness.&quot;

Some complexes can usurp power from the ego and can cause psychological disturbances and symptoms resulting from the development of a neurosis. Jung described the autonomous, self-directing nature of complexes when he said 
On the other hand, Jung spoke of the &quot;differentiating functions&quot; as essentially the healthy development of useful complexes, yet not without bringing about often undesirable side effects.

In &quot;Psychological Types&quot;, Jung describes the effects of tensions between the dominant and inferior differentiating functions, often forming complexes and neuroses, in high and even extremely one-sided types.

==In archetypal psychology==

Suffering contains complexes; complexes contain archetypes; archetypes contain the myths of deities; this figurative analogy is used to understand the afflicted subject.

==Complexes and subpersonalities==
Jung conceptualized complexes as having a high degree of autonomy, describing them as ‘splinter psyches’ that form the basis for ‘mini-personalities’, whom he called the ‘little people’.
This provided the foundation for later expansion of the idea, most notably by British Psychotherapist John Rowan, who referred to them as subpersonalities, each one operating as a &#x27;semipermanent and semi-autonomous region of the personality capable of acting as a person&#x27;.

The work of Rowan and others led to the widespread use of techniques by which psychotherapists encourage clients to express the thoughts, feelings, and attitudes of their various subpersonalities, as a way of facilitating the integration of diverse characteristics, part of what Jung called individuation.

<text>A primary metabolite is a kind of metabolite that is directly involved in normal growth, development, and reproduction. It usually performs a physiological function in the organism (i.e. an intrinsic function). A primary metabolite is typically present in many organisms or cells. It is also referred to as a central metabolite, which has an even more restricted meaning (present in any autonomously growing cell or organism). Some common examples of primary metabolites include: lactic acid, and certain amino acids. Note that primary metabolites do not show any pharmacological actions or effects.

Conversely, a secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has an important ecological function (i.e. a relational function). A secondary metabolite is typically present in a taxonomically restricted set of organisms or cells (plants, fungi, bacteria, etc.). Some common examples of secondary metabolites include: ergot alkaloids, antibiotics, naphthalenes, nucleosides, phenazines, quinolines, terpenoids, peptides and growth factors.

Plant growth regulators may be classified as both primary and secondary metabolites due to their role in plant growth and development. Some of them are intermediates between primary and secondary metabolism.

<text>: &quot;For the software testing tools, see xUnit.&quot;

The x unit (symbol xu) is a unit of length approximately equal to 0.1 pm (10−13 m). It is used to quote the wavelength of X-rays and gamma rays.

Originally defined by the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn (1886–1978) in 1925, the x unit could not at that time be measured directly; the definition was instead made in terms of the spacing between planes of the calcite crystals used in the measuring apparatus. One x unit was set at of the spacing of the (200) planes of calcite at 18 °C.

In modern usage, there are two separate x units, which are defined in terms of the wavelengths of the two most commonly used X-ray lines in X-ray crystallography:
* the copper x unit (symbol xu(Cu Kα1)) is defined so that the wavelength of the Kα1 line of copper is exactly 1537.400 xu(Cu Kα1);
* the molybdenum x unit (symbol xu(Mo Kα1)) is defined so that the wavelength of the Kα1 line of molybdenum is exactly 707.831 xu(Mo Kα1).

The 2006 CODATA recommended values for these units are:
: 1 xu(Cu Kα1) = ,
: 1 xu(Mo Kα1) = .

<doc id="722873" wikidata="Q1513913" url="?curid=722873" title="Triakis icosahedron">
<text>In geometry, the triakis icosahedron is an Archimedean dual solid, or a Catalan solid, with 60 isosceles triangle faces. Its dual is the truncated dodecahedron. It has also been called the kisicosahedron. It was first depicted, in a non-convex form with equilateral triangle faces, by Leonardo da Vinci in Luca Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, where it was named the &quot;icosahedron elevatum&quot;. The capsid of the Hepatitis A virus has the shape of a triakis icosahedron.

==As a Kleetope==
The triakis icosahedron can be formed by gluing triangular pyramids to each face of a regular icosahedron. Depending on the height of these pyramids relative to their base, the result can be either convex or non-convex. This construction, of gluing pyramids to each face, is an instance of a general construction called the Kleetope; the triakis icosahedron is the Kleetope of the icosahedron. This interpretation is also expressed in the name, triakis, which is used for the Kleetopes of polyhedra with triangular faces.

When depicted in Leonardo&#x27;s form, with equilateral triangle faces, it is an example of a non-convex deltahedron, one of the few known deltahedra that are isohedral (meaning that all faces are symmetric to each other). In another of the non-convex forms of the triakis icosahedron, the three triangles adjacent to each pyramid are coplanar, and can be thought of as instead forming the visible parts of a convex hexagon, in a self-intersecting polyhedron with 20 hexagonal faces that has been called the small triambic icosahedron. Alternatively, for the same form of the triakis icosahedron, the triples of coplanar isosceles triangles form the faces of the first stellation of the icosahedron. Yet another non-convex form, with golden isosceles triangle faces, forms the outer shell of the great stellated dodecahedron, a Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron with twelve pentagram faces.

Each edge of the triakis icosahedron has endpoints of total degree at least 13. By Kotzig&#x27;s theorem, this is the most possible for any polyhedron. The same total degree is obtained from the Kleetope of any polyhedron with minimum degree five, but the triakis icosahedron is the simplest example of this construction. Although this Kleetope has isosceles triangle faces, iterating the Kleetope construction on it produces convex polyhedra with triangular faces that cannot all be isosceles.

==As a Catalan solid==

The triakis icosahedron is a Catalan solid, the dual polyhedron of the truncated dodecahedron. The truncated dodecahedron is an Archimedean solid, with faces that are regular decagons and equilateral triangles, and with all edges having unit length; its vertices lie on a common sphere, the circumsphere of the truncated decahedron. The polar reciprocation of this solid through this sphere is a convex form of the triakis icosahedron, with all faces tangent to the same sphere, now an inscribed sphere, with coordinates and dimensions that can be calculated as follows.

Let formula_1 denote the golden ratio. The short edges of this form of the triakis icosahedron have length

and the long edges have length

Its faces are isosceles triangles with one obtuse angle of

and two acute angles of
As a Catalan solid, its dihedral angles are all equal, formula_2160°36&#x27;45.188&quot;. One possible set of 32 Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of the triakis icosahedron centered at the origin (scaled differently than the one above) can be generated by combining the vertices of two appropriately scaled Platonic solids, the regular icosahedron and a regular dodecahedron:
* Twelve vertices of a regular icosahedron, scaled to have a unit circumradius, with the coordinates formula_3
* Twenty vertices of a regular dodecahedron, scaled to have circumradius formula_4 with the coordinates formula_5 and formula_6

==Symmetry==
In any of its standard convex or non-convex forms, the triakis icosahedron has the same symmetries as a regular icosahedron.
The three types of symmetry axes of the icosahedron, through two opposite vertices, edge midpoints, and face centroids, become respectively axes through opposite pairs of degree-ten vertices of the triakis icosahedron, through opposite midpoints of edges between degree-ten vertices, and through opposite pairs of degree-three vertices.

<doc id="722875" wikidata="Q254198" url="?curid=722875" title="WWE Intercontinental Championship">
<text>The WWE Intercontinental Championship is a men&#x27;s professional wrestling championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on the Raw brand division. It is one of two secondary championships for WWE&#x27;s main roster, along with the WWE United States Championship on SmackDown. The current champion is Bron Breakker, who is in his second reign. He won the title by defeating Jey Uso on the October 21, 2024, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

The championship was established by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on September 1, 1979, as a result of the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship being unified with an apocryphal South American Heavyweight Championship, with Pat Patterson as the inaugural champion. It is the third-oldest championship currently active in WWE, behind the WWE Championship (1963) and United States Championship (1975), but the second-longest tenured championship, as WWE has only owned the U.S. championship since 2001. Although generally contested in the midcard at WWE shows, it has been defended in the main event of pay-per-views including WrestleMania VI, SummerSlam in 1992, the third and eighth In Your House shows, Backlash in 2001, and at Extreme Rules in 2018. It has been called a &quot;stepping stone&quot; to a WWE world championship.

In November 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship was unified into the Intercontinental Championship. In 2002, after the introduction of the first brand split, it became exclusive to Raw and the WWF was renamed WWE. Later that year, the European and Hardcore championships were unified into the Intercontinental Championship, which itself was unified into the World Heavyweight Championship (original version). The next year, it was reactivated for Raw, followed by the United States Championship&#x27;s reactivation as a counterpart championship on SmackDown. The Intercontinental Championship has switched between brands over the years, usually as a result of the WWE Draft; the 2023 draft moved the title back to Raw.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;intercontinental&quot; in the title originally referred to North and South America. In 1985, the championship belt design changed, the centerplate now centered on the Atlantic Ocean, in a map including western Africa and Europe. On April 7, 1989, the championship was first defended outside of North America, by Rick Rude against the Ultimate Warrior in Turin, Italy. On March 30, 1991, Mr. Perfect made the first Asian defense against The Texas Tornado at a WWF co-promotion with Super World of Sports in Tokyo, Japan. It first came to Africa on April 6, 1997, when champion Rocky Maivia pinned Savio Vega in Durban, South Africa. Shelton Benjamin made the first Australian defense on April 7, 2005, pinning Gene Snitsky in Brisbane.

== History ==

WWF North American Heavyweight Champion Pat Patterson became the inaugural champion on September 1, 1979. It was said he had unified his title with the South American Heavyweight Championship, in a tournament in Rio de Janeiro, although both the tournament and South American Championship were entirely fictional.

On April 1, 1990, at WrestleMania VI, Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion the Ultimate Warrior defeated WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan to win the world title; so the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time soon after. Mr. Perfect then won a tournament to crown a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion.

On October 17, 1999, Chyna became the only woman to hold the Intercontinental Championship by defeating Jeff Jarrett at No Mercy. Following the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF) purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001, the title was unified with the WCW United States Championship at Survivor Series, causing the United States Championship to become inactive. Then-United States Champion Edge defeated then-Intercontinental Champion Test.

In 2002, after the first brand split had begun and the WWF was renamed WWE, Raw general manager Eric Bischoff began unifying his brand&#x27;s singles championships. On July 22, 2002, the Intercontinental Championship was unified with the European Championship in a ladder match, in which then-Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated then-European Champion Jeff Hardy. On August 19, 2002, Bischoff made a six-minute gauntlet match for the Hardcore Championship, with the winner facing Van Dam in a second unification match the next week on &quot;Raw&quot;. Tommy Dreamer successfully retained his title in that match, and lost to Van Dam in a hardcore match the next week. As a result of the victories over Hardy and Dreamer, Van Dam is regarded as the last European and Hardcore champion in WWE history; these were his first and fourth reigns with those respective titles. On September 30, 2002, Bischoff scheduled a match to unify the Intercontinental Championship with the recently created Raw-exclusive World Heavyweight Championship. The unification match took place at No Mercy the following month and saw then-World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeat then-Intercontinental Champion Kane, making him the Raw brand&#x27;s sole male singles champion.

Over Bischoff&#x27;s objections, Raw co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin reactivated the Intercontinental Championship on the May 5, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and declared any former champion on the Raw roster eligible to enter a battle royal at Judgment Day for the title. Christian won the battle royal to win the championship and restore a secondary singles title for Raw wrestlers to compete for. Eventually, WWE did the same thing for SmackDown and created a separate set of titles for that brand; for its secondary title, SmackDown reactivated the United States Championship that had been unified with the Intercontinental Championship in 2001, placing the WWE name on it while claiming the lineage of the old WCW title of the same name (much as they did with the Cruiserweight Championship when that became WWE exclusive).

On May 31, 2015, the championship was contested in an Elimination Chamber match for the first time.

In July 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand split. During the 2016 draft, then-Intercontinental Champion The Miz was drafted to SmackDown. Just days later, he successfully defended the title against Raw draftee Darren Young at Battleground, making the title exclusive to SmackDown. During the following year&#x27;s Superstar Shake-up, Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose was moved to the Raw brand, making the title exclusive to Raw. Two years later during the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, Intercontinental Champion Finn Bálor moved to SmackDown, making the title exclusive back to SmackDown. Later that year, the NXT brand, WWE&#x27;s developmental territory, became WWE&#x27;s third major brand when it was moved to the USA Network in September, thus making the NXT North American Championship a third secondary title in WWE. However, this recognition was reversed when NXT reverted to being WWE&#x27;s developmental brand in September 2021. In late 2024, the WWE introduced the women&#x27;s counterpart to the Intercontinental Championship.

==Belt design==
The 1985 version of the Intercontinental Championship belt, designed by Reggie Parks, consisted of a gold center plate featuring a blue globe, with the red WWF block logo on top which was then later changed to gold. On the top ribbon of the belt, it reads &quot;INTERCONTINENTAL&quot; with the three stars on each side while the bottom inscription reads &quot;HEAVYWEIGHT WRESTLING CHAMPION&quot;. The championship belt also had four identical side plates. Like the main WWF Championship, the strap can be changed to a custom color such as yellow worn by The Ultimate Warrior and blue worn by Shawn Michaels.

In 1998, after Stone Cold Steve Austin won the title, the Intercontinental Championship was redesigned again, after he threw the previous title into the river. The belt originally had a purple strap and the WWF block logo, but was later redesigned again with a black strap and the WWF scratch logo. The center plate was oval shaped and had featured an oval shaped globe with the company&#x27;s logo in the center. On the top it had six faux diamonds and the inscription initially read &quot;World Wrestling Federation&quot; while the bottom had two texts read &quot;INTERCONTINENTAL&quot; on the ribbon and &quot;CHAMPION&quot; on the bottom. Each of the four side plates represents the continents: the first plate contained the WWF logo and the text Antarctica, the second plate read Europe and Africa, while the third plates represent the Americas (particularly North America and South America), and the fourth plate also reads Asia and Australia. The belt&#x27;s design was unchanged albeit the name change in 2002 when WWF changed its name to WWE, thus replacing the texts with &quot;World Wrestling Entertainment&quot; accordingly.

On October 2, 2011, at Hell in a Cell, Cody Rhodes reintroduced a modified version of Parks&#x27; 1985–1998 championship belt design with the white strap, with the modern WWE &quot;scratch logo&quot; and other embellishments. Following the end of the first brand split on August 29, 2011, the title could be defended on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On August 18, 2014, the Intercontinental Championship belt, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the long-standing scratch logo with WWE&#x27;s current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network that launched earlier that year in February.

On the November 22, 2019, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Sami Zayn presented a new belt design to champion Shinsuke Nakamura. The redesigned Intercontinental Championship returned to being on a black strap with an entirely new center plate with an irregular shape. The center portion of the center plate features an oval-shape. The top half of the oval says &quot;Intercontinental&quot; and the bottom half says &quot;Champion&quot;; the word &quot;Heavyweight&quot; sits in a banner on the inner side of the oval above the word &quot;Champion&quot;. At the center of the oval is a diamond shape, representing a wrestling ring viewed from above, with the WWE logo over a globe. On the sides of the center, plate is two halves of the globe. The left side features the continents of North and South America as well as Africa and Europe, while the globe on the left shows Asia and Australia; both globes show a portion of Antarctica. The rest of the center plate is filled with ornamentation. Like all of WWE&#x27;s other championships, the belt features two side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion&#x27;s logos; the default side plates consist of the WWE logo over a globe. On the September 30, 2024, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, upon Jey Uso winning the championship from Bron Breakker the week prior, the championship received a minor update by adding blue on the globes on the centerplate.

== Brand designation history ==
Following the brand split on March 25, 2002, all titles in WWE became exclusive to either the Raw brand or SmackDown brand. The brand split was discontinued on August 29, 2011, and revived on July 19, 2016. The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the Intercontinental Championship between the Raw and SmackDown brands.

==Tournaments==
===WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship Tournament (1990)===
The WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship Tournament was a tournament to decide a new WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after previous champion Ultimate Warrior was required to vacate the title after he defeated Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania VI.

===WWF Intercontinental Championship Tournament (1996)===
The WWF Intercontinental Championship Tournament was a tournament to decide a new WWF Intercontinental Champion after previous champion Ahmed Johnson forfeited the title. He suffered (kayfabe) injuries to both kidneys when he was attacked by the debuting Faarooq after winning an 11-man battle royal.

===WWF Intercontinental Championship Tournament (1997)===
The tournament to determine the new WWF Intercontinental Champion after former champion Stone Cold Steve Austin forfeited the belt after his neck injury. The tournament was held between September 8 and October 5, 1997, with the finals occurring on October 5 at the pay-per-view. The tournament brackets were:

Notes:
1 &lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===WWF Intercontinental Championship Tournament (1998)===
The WWF Intercontinental Championship Tournament was a tournament to decide a new WWF Intercontinental Champion after previous champion Triple H vacated the title due to injury.

===WWE Intercontinental Championship #1 Contender&#x27;s Tournament (2008)===
A tournament was announced to crown a new #1 contender for William Regal&#x27;s WWE Intercontinental Championship. CM Punk won the tournament by defeating Rey Mysterio in the tournament final at Armageddon.
===WWE Intercontinental Championship Tournament (2010)===
The WWE Intercontinental Championship Tournament was a tournament to crown a new Intercontinental Champion. On May 7, 2010, after failed attempts of getting Intercontinental Champion Drew McIntyre to stop attacking Matt Hardy, Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long fired McIntyre and vacated the title. The following week, Kofi Kingston won a tournament to become the new champion, but Mr. McMahon reverted Long&#x27;s decision. Due to the decision by Mr. McMahon, the vacancy of the title and Kingston&#x27;s championship win are not recognized as WWE continued to recognize McIntyre as champion during that period. At Over the Limit, Kingston defeated McIntyre to win his second official Intercontinental Championship.

=== WWE Intercontinental Championship Tournament (2020) ===
On May 12, 2020, the Intercontinental Championship was declared vacant after champion Sami Zayn elected to refrain from competing during the COVID-19 pandemic. A tournament to crown a new champion was then set to begin on the May 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.
† Neither Jeff Hardy nor Elias were able to compete in the semifinals, as Elias was (kayfabe) injured in a car crash and Hardy was accused of causing it and arrested. AJ Styles and Daniel Bryan were given the option of having a bye in the tournament. Styles opted for the bye to automatically advance to the final on June 12 while Bryan opted to have a new opponent; Sheamus subsequently won a battle royal to qualify for the vacant spot in the semifinals against Bryan that night.

== Reigns ==
The inaugural champion was Pat Patterson who, as the WWF North American Heavyweight Champion in September 1979 was also declared &quot;South American Heavyweight Champion&quot; after allegedly winning a tournament in Rio de Janeiro. Patterson unified the two championships into the Intercontinental Championship. Since then, there have been 187 reigns among 91 different champions. Chris Jericho has the most reigns with nine. At 666 days, Gunther&#x27;s reign is the longest in the title&#x27;s history, both as a singular reign and for most cumulative days as champion. Prior to his reign, Pedro Morales had the longest combined reign at 619 days over two reigns, and held this record for over 41 years. Dean Douglas had the shortest reign at just 13 minutes and 52 seconds. Chyna is the only woman to win the title. The youngest champion was Jeff Hardy, who won the championship for the first time at the age of 23, while the oldest champion was Ric Flair, who won the championship at the age of 56. There have been 10 vacancies throughout the title&#x27;s history. Only five men have held the title for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: Pedro Morales, Don Muraco, Randy Savage, The Honky Tonk Man, and Gunther.

Bron Breakker is the current champion in his second reign. He won the title by defeating Jey Uso on the October 21, 2024, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Reception==
The Intercontinental Championship&#x27;s early years have been praised. Samuel Kendall of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; lauded the championship during this era, stating: &quot;It was a foregone conclusion that the Intercontinental Champion was the workhorse of the company and the next in line for the World Heavyweight Championship&quot;. Steve Cook of &quot;411Mania&quot; wrote that &quot;nearly anybody that was a big deal in WWE held the championship at some point.&quot; Steve Austin said he considered the Intercontinental Championship to be as important as the world titles and he remains in possession of the physical belt that represented the championship during his reign because of its historical importance. 

Throughout the 2010s, WWE was criticized for its booking of the Intercontinental Champions, with champions either not defending during long periods of time or losing in many of their non-title matches. Chris Jericho said that WWE promoter Vince McMahon told him that &quot;nobody fucking cares about the Intercontinental Championship&quot; after he asked to be placed in a match for the title at WrestleMania 29 in 2013. Also in 2013, Darren Gutteridge of &quot;Pro Wrestling Dot Net&quot; wrote that the &quot;title has proven an albatross for the past decade, with almost all title holders doomed to tread water, usually only beating people decisively when the title is on the line&quot;. The albatross metaphor was also used to describe the title in 2014 by James Caldwell of &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot;, while Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer&quot; said that year that &quot;the [Intercontinental] title isn&#x27;t booked to mean much.&quot; Various commentators in 2014 and 2015, including from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;PWInsider,&quot; and &quot;Pro Wrestling Dot Net&quot; have pointed out that the Intercontinental Champion often loses non-title matches, while Mike Tedesco of &quot;Wrestleview&quot; questioned how Intercontinental Champions losing too much is supposed to bring prestige to the title. 

The championship continued to receive criticism into the early 2020s. Kendall panned the recent reigns as forgettable and wrote that the title had &quot;turned into a prop to be lugged around, rather than a title that should bestow prestige.&quot; Cook wrote that it had been &quot;treated as something of an afterthought&quot; for the previous two decades. The championship was only defended on two pay-per-views in 2021 and was not defended at any within the first quarter of 2022, including WrestleMania 38; its absence on the premiere event was widely criticized by fans.

After Vince McMahon retired as chairman, CEO, and Head of Creative on July 22, 2022, the championship has been featured more prominently after Triple H took over as the new Head of Creative. The championship has been featured in the main event of numerous episodes of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and has even received two five-star ratings from Meltzer. The first was Gunther defending against Sheamus at Clash at the Castle, while the second was Gunther defending against Sheamus and Drew McIntyre in a triple threat match at WrestleMania 39: Night 2, making it the first time Meltzer gave more than one five-star match rating for any main roster championship reign. The last time the Intercontinental Championship received such a rating before Gunther&#x27;s reign was Shawn Michaels going against Razor Ramon in an Intercontinental Unification ladder match at WrestleMania X.

<text>Viacheslav Mikhail-ipa Tsugba (, ; born 1 January 1944) was the third Prime Minister of the Republic of Abkhazia (a de facto independent republic of Georgia) from December 1999 to May 2001. Before his appointment as prime minister, Tsugba had headed the Central Election Committee, which had overseen the internationally unrecognised simultaneously held October 1999 presidential election and constitutional referendum.

==Early life and career==
Viacheslav Tsugba was born on 1 January 1944 in the village of Aatsy in the Gudauta District of what was then the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1970, Tsugba graduated from the Sukhumi Pedagological Institute. In 1978, he became aspirant member of the Academy of Social Sciences of the CPSU Central Committee. From 1973 until 1975, Tsugba was 1st secretary of the Abkhazian regional committee of the Komsomol, from 1975 until 1978 he was 1st secretary of the Ochamchira raikom of the CPSU, and from 1978 to 1989 Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Abkhazian ASSR.

On 20 July 1991, Tsugba was appointed Chairman of the Central Election Commission of Abkhazia.

==Prime minister==
After Vladislav Ardzinba&#x27;s re-election as president, Viacheslav Tsugba was appointed prime minister on 20 December 1999.

Tsugba&#x27;s time as prime minister was marked by a relative thawing of tensions between Abkhazia and Georgia. While Tsugba, like all the other prime ministers, strongly opposed any idea of reunification with Georgia, and highly criticised cross-border raids by Georgian paramilitaries, he managed to demilitarise the conflict to a degree. This was highlighted by an agreement signed in July 2000, where both sides agreed not to settle the conflict by force. He tended to negotiate alongside foreign minister Sergei Shamba, rather than handling negotiations himself.

In the first months of 2001, Tsugba was increasingly criticised by the opposition, led by the Amtsakhara movement. On 15 May 2001 Tsugba handed in his resignation. This remained secret for two weeks, and rumours that Tsugba had handed in his resignation which surfaced towards the end of May were denied by the President&#x27;s press spokesman Raul Agrba. But on 30 May, President Ardzinba accepted Tsugba&#x27;s resignation.

In his resignation request, Tsugba&#x27;s explanation was that &quot;serious problems have arisen in connection with lawmaking, the professional qualifications of personnel at all levels of administration, from the highest to the lowest, with their accountability and the need to improve management and increase strict control and institute an uncompromising fight against crime.&quot;

==Vice Speaker of Parliament==
Tsugba has been a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly of Abkhazia since 2002 and is one of its current Vice Speakers.

<text>Kunta Kinteh Island, formerly called James Island and St Andrew&#x27;s Island, is an island in the Gambia River, from the river mouth and near Juffureh in the Republic of the Gambia. Fort James is located on the island. It is less than 3.2 km (2 miles) from Albreda on the river&#x27;s northern bank. As an important historical site in the West African slave trade, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with related sites including a ruined Portuguese chapel and a colonial warehouse in Albreda, the &quot;Maurel Frères Building&quot; in Juffureh, and Fort Bullen and Six-Gun Battery, which are located at the mouth of the Gambia River.

==History==

The first record of European interaction with the island is in May 1456, when a Portuguese expedition led by Italian explorers Alvise Cadamosto and Antoniotto Usodimare moored off the island. They buried one of their sailors, named Andrew, on the island, giving it its first European name—St Andrew&#x27;s Island. Diogo Gomes also anchored off St Andrew&#x27;s Island on his expedition in 1458. A Portuguese settlement, San Domingo, was built on the northern bank of Gambia River, opposite St Andrew&#x27;s Island, in the 15th century.

The first European settlers on the island came from the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, who also had other colonial possessions in the area, although the English Crown had granted the island to two separate companies in 1588 and 1618. In 1651, the settlers built a fort that they named Jacob Fort after Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland, and used it as a trade base. Major Fock, a Courland soldier, was placed in charge of the first settlement and oversaw the construction of fortifications on St Andrew&#x27;s Island, which were built following the recognised contemporary rules of military engineering. The main building was in the shape of a rectangle, and was flanked at each corner by a bastion, each of which was triangular. However, the fort had no water supply, and was forced to rely on the good will of the King of Barra in order to stay operational.

It was the intention of the Duke of Courland to establish a permanent settlement on St Andrew&#x27;s Island, and so married couples were sent out to the island as well as a pastor. The first pastor was Gottschalk Eberling, who was replaced in 1655 by Joachim Dannefeld. The island had a small church built out of cane and with a thatched roof, from which Eberling and Dannefeld preached. There was a supposed deposit of gold at the river, so the Duke of Courland resolved to launch a full expedition to the Gambia. As few Courlanders had experience of Africa, he was forced to rely on foreigners. On 6 September 1652, he appointed the Dutchman Jacob du Moulin as his Director in the Gambia, while a Courlander, Frederick William Trotta von Treyden was appointed as his lieutenant.

Three ships, the &quot;Crocodile&quot;, the &quot;Patientia&quot;, and the &quot;Chur&quot;, were placed at Moulin&#x27;s disposal. There were a number of issues with the expedition, and in December 1652, Treyden wrote to the Duke of Courland describing Moulin as a &quot;light-hearted knave&quot;. After setting sail in March 1653, the expedition shortly after ran out of supplies and was forced to return. Moulin was subsequently arrested for his various misdeeds, including embezzling the Duke&#x27;s money. A second expedition was attempted in 1654, under the command of a Danish explorer, Philip von Seitz. However, Seitz abandoned the expedition in Hamburg, managing to extract 15,000 rixdollars from the Duke.

After these two failed expeditions, the Duke turned to his own people. Captain Otto Stiel, a Courlander who had previously visited the Gambia, was appointed as its Governor and as Commandant of St Andrew&#x27;s Island. In 1658, the Duke of Courland and his family were captured by a Swedish mercenary after becoming embroiled in the “Deluge”, the Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and communication between Courland and St Andrew&#x27;s Island was cut off for around two years. 

As a result of this, the Dutch West India Company made an agreement with the Duke&#x27;s representative in Holland, Henry Momber, by which it would both resupply and take over St Andrew&#x27;s Island. Momber agreed, in the absence of any instructions from the Duke. The Dutch sent a ship of soldiers to the island to seize it. Stiel objected, but on learning that the Dutch West India Company would guarantee them their pay, the garrison mutinied and returned to Holland on the ship that had brought out the new garrison.

In 1660, the Dutch lost control of the island after a French privateer in Swedish service had surprised the fort at night, expelled the garrison and plundered the island. The privateer subsequently met a merchant ship of the Groningen chamber of the Dutch West India Company, who, in a breakdown of communications, refused to buy back the island and said that it belonged to the Duke of Courland, rather than the Amsterdam chamber of the same company. Momber got in touch with Stiel, who had been living in Holland, and he traveled back to St Andrew&#x27;s Island in a ship provided by the Groningen chamber.

Several weeks later, three ships of the Amsterdam chamber anchored off the island and demanded that Stiel surrender. He refused, and the Dutch effected a landing, bringing a large amount of firepower to bear on the fort. With only a handful of men, Stiel was forced to surrender. However, when the King of Barra saw Stiel evicted again, he decided to come to his aid by capturing a party of Dutchmen who had landed at Juffure for fresh water. The King demanded that Stiel be re-instated and was joined by a large number of other native kingdoms, including the King of Kombo. The Dutch relented after a four-week stand-off, and the commander of the fort left it without provisions and partially destroyed before turning it back over to Stiel and the Courlanders. Over the next eight months, the garrison was reduced to just seven Europeans.

The Dutch briefly held the fort from 1659 until the English captured it in 1661. The Dutch ceded the fort to the English in 1664.
The English renamed the island James Island and the fort Fort James after James, the Duke of York, later King James II of England. The chartered Royal Adventurers in Africa Company administered the territory, which used it first for the gold and ivory trade, and later in the slave trade. On 1 August 1669, the company sublet the administration to the Gambia Adventurers. In 1684, the Royal African Company took over the Gambia&#x27;s administration.

In 1695, the French captured Fort James after a battle with English sailors, but by 1702, Fort James was once again definitively under English control. It was destroyed and rebuilt several times in this period, both in conflicts between the English and French and by pirates. On 13 June 1750, the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa assumed the administration of the Gambia. Between 1758 and 1779, the Gambia was part of British Senegambia.

The Six-Gun Battery (1816) and Fort Bullen (1826), now included in the James Island UNESCO World Heritage Site and located on both sides of the mouth of the River Gambia, were built with the specific intent of thwarting the slave trade once it had become illegal in the British Empire after the passing of the Slave Trade Act in 1807. They are the only known defensive structures in the region built to stop slaving interests, as opposed to enforcing them. These sites along with the island itself were abandoned in 1870.

On 6 February 2011, at the request of New York artist Chaz Guest to Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, it was renamed to Kunta Kinteh Island to give the island a Gambian name. At the renaming ceremony, Guest revealed the miniature replica of his 9-m (30-foot) statue of Kunta Kinte that would be displayed on Kunta Kinte Island.

==Legacy==
Kunta Kinteh Island is suffering heavy erosion and is now approximately 1/6 of the size it had been during the time when the fort was active. Ruins of several of the British administrative buildings (including a single cell, apparently used to house the most troublesome captives), a small jetty and a number of skeletal baobab trees remain. The ruins have been stabilised and protected by a capping. Because the island is low-lying, during high tide and storms sometimes waves will beat against some of the surviving structures.

Kunta Kinte, a character described in Alex Haley&#x27;s book and TV series &quot;&quot;, has become associated with James Island. The book states that Kunta Kinte was among 98 slaves that the slave ship &quot;Lord Ligonier&quot; brought to Annapolis, Maryland in 1767.

<doc id="722896" wikidata="Q5986604" url="?curid=722896" title="Icon (character)">
<text>Icon (Arnus; alias Augustus Freeman) is a fictional superhero appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, one of the headline characters introduced by Milestone Media in the 1990s. A being from another planet, he has taken on the form of an African-American man, and has abilities such as flight, super-strength, and invulnerability. He uses these in partnership with Rocket, a human teenager using his alien technology, to protect the people of the fictional city of Dakota.

==Publication history==

An original character from Milestone Comics, he was created by Dwayne McDuffie and M. D. Bright and first appeared in &quot;Icon&quot; #1 (May 1993). Although published and distributed by DC Comics, the Milestone titles took place in a different continuity. In addition to guest appearances in other titles, the character appeared monthly in his own series, until the Milestone imprint was discontinued in 1997. In 1994, the character was involved in &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;, a month-long crossover between Milestone and DC Comics&#x27; Superman titles.

In the late 2000s, the Milestone Universe and characters were revived and merged into the DC Universe, as part of an agreement between DC Comics and Milestone Media. The merger treated the characters as new to the universe, ignoring the previous crossover. Icon, along with Shadow Cabinet, appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #27, written by McDuffie.

==Fictional character biography==
Icon is a Terminan alien who is stranded on Earth in the 1800s after the starliner he is on malfunctions and jettisons him in a life-pod. He is discovered and adopted by a slave named Miriam, whose DNA the pod absorbs to give Arnus a human disguise.

Due to his longevity, Arnus periodically assumes the identity of his own son. By the late 20th century, he is posing as Augustus Freeman IV, the great-grandson of his original human identity, and becomes a superhero alongside his protégé Rocket.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Orion kills his father Darkseid, destabilizing the multiverse. Dharma transfers the Milestone characters to the DC universe, altering history so that they always existed there.

==Supporting characters==
* Raquel Ervin/Rocket – Raquel saw Augustus Freeman IV use his powers when his home was being robbed, and convinced him to become a super hero, as well as take her on as sidekick. All of Rocket&#x27;s superhuman powers derive from her inertia belt, based on tech from Icon&#x27;s ship.
* Darnice/Rocket II – Raquel&#x27;s best friend. Darnice took on the role of Rocket while Racquel was on maternity leave (one insisted upon by both Icon and her close friends).
* Amistad Ervin – Raquel&#x27;s infant son, named for the Spanish slave ship and for her partner, Icon.

* Rufus T. Wild/&quot;Buck Wild, Mercenary Man&quot; – A superhero who possesses superhuman strength and durability, and is a parody of Marvel Comics character Luke Cage. He is recruited to replace Icon when he returns to his home planet before being killed in battle with Oblivion.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to his hybrid physiology, Icon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities that are unusual even for a Terminan. He possesses superhuman physical abilities and senses and can fly and generate energy. Furthermore, Icon is a skilled combatant and lawyer.

Icon&#x27;s costume further increases his durability and can be summoned and dispersed at will. His starship can travel at light speeds, become invisible, and possesses a computerized database and a factory that can replicate matter.

==Collected editions==
===Trade paperbacks===
==In other media==
Icon appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Tony Todd. This version is an associate, later member, of the Justice League.

==Politics==
* Icon is a conservative Republican who holds conservative views on economic and social issues, which often put him in conflict with more liberal Milestone Comics superheroes, including his sidekick. Clarence Thomas was an avowed fan of Icon, to the extent that he quoted the character on multiple occasions; upon learning of this, author Dwayne McDuffie, who in the blog post he wrote on the matter described himself as very liberal, suffered writer&#x27;s block out of fears that dialogue he wrote would be used in the service of conservatism.

==Awards==
* &quot;Icon&quot; was nominated for three Eisners and is a three-time winner of Parents&#x27; Choice Award honors.

==Crossovers==
* &quot;Shadow War&quot; - Milestone company-wide crossover, which involved all comics, including the newly premiered &quot;Xombi&quot; and &quot;Shadow Cabinet&quot;.
* &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; - Milestone company-wide crossover, consisting of three issues of the comic by the same title along with tie-ins in every Milestone title.
* &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; - A postal worker named Fred Bentson unwittingly becomes a portal between the DC and Milestone universes. Eventually, Bentson loses control of his powers and transforms into Rift, a cosmic being capable of manipulating matter. The heroes of two universes come together to stop him and seal the dangerous rift between their worlds. This crossover with Milestone Universe and DC Universe characters included Blood Syndicate, Hardware, Icon, Static, and DC&#x27;s Steel, Superman, and Superboy.

<doc id="722903" wikidata="Q438428" url="?curid=722903" title="Alice Bunker Stockham">
<text>Alice Bunker Stockham (November 8, 1833 – December 3, 1912) was an obstetrician and gynecologist from Chicago, and the fifth woman to become a doctor in the United States. She promoted gender equality, dress reform, birth control, and male and female sexual fulfillment for successful marriages.

A well-traveled and well-read person who counted among her friends Leo Tolstoy and Havelock Ellis, she also visited Sweden and from her trips to schools there she brought back the idea of teaching children domestic crafts, thus single-handedly establishing shop and home economics classes in the United States.

==Activism==
Alice Bunker Stockham was born in Cardington, Ohio, on November 8, 1833, and received her MD from the Chicago Homeopathic Medical College in 1892.

She lectured against the use of corsets by women, advocated complete abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and believed in women&#x27;s rights. Stockham was a vegetarian. In 1893, she was a speaker at the Third International Vegetarian Congress in Chicago.

Stockham was very concerned with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted to get off the street. She felt these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves, so she had copies of her book &quot;Tokology&quot;, a layperson&#x27;s guide to gynecology and midwifery, privately printed and gave them to &quot;unfortunate women&quot; to sell door-to-door in Chicago. Each copy came with a bound-in certificate signed by Stockham, entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam.

In 1905, a then 72-year old Stockham and her publisher were convicted of circulating improper literature under the Comstock laws.

She died at her home in Alhambra, California on December 3, 1912.

==Karezza==

She coined the term Karezza (from the Italian for &quot;caress&quot;) and authored a book by this name in 1896. It refers to non-religious spiritual sexual practices that draw upon tantric techniques of body control but do not involve any of tantra&#x27;s cultural or iconographic symbolism.

She promoted Karezza as a means to achieve:
# birth control (she was against abortion but she wanted women to be able to control pregnancies);
# social and political equality for women (she felt that &quot;Karezza men&quot; would never rape their wives and would actually treat them &quot;decently&quot;);
# marital pleasure and hence marital fidelity (she advocated Karezza as a cure for &quot;failing marriages&quot;).

Stockham&#x27;s interest in birth control could not overcome her fear that a mechanical sperm barrier would prevent &quot;the complete interchange of magnetism&quot; (a theory popular among 19th century sexual-spiritual teachers). In part this stems from the biblical injunction against Onanism, but she also felt a failure of magnetic interchange was injurious and unnatural.

Thus she advocated &quot;the Oneida method&quot; (from the Oneida Society), then also known as &quot;male continence&quot;, in which men refrained from ejaculation but women were encouraged to have contractive orgasms at will. In later writings she also began to promulgate the need for women to learn to control their orgasm responses in the same way that the men of Oneida did. Ultimately, Stockham rejected the &quot;male continence&quot; techniques of John Humphrey Noyes in favour of gender parity in orgasm control. She also rejected Noyes&#x27; polyamorous ideas and promoted Karezza as a way to strengthen marriage and monogamy.

Stockham&#x27;s gender-parity version of tantra yoga, despite its somewhat anti-orgasmic, and thus apparently anti-hedonistic bent, serves as an important counterpoint to the male-centered aspects of traditional tantric sexual practices and later variants such as the &quot;sex-magick&quot; of Aleister Crowley. In the field of sex magic, the only practice that is similar to Karezza as far as the sex act is concerned is Samael Aun Weor&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Matrimony&quot;; otherwise, they diverge as far as doctrine is concerned. She saw Karezza as a way to promote health and happiness in marriage. The emphasis was on selflessness in lovemaking, gentle, harmonious passion leading to sublime spiritual delights.

Despite the many benefits of Stockham&#x27;s approach, including granting couples the ability to choose opportunities for parenthood without contraceptives, the Vatican did not like Karezza or its relatives. Forty years after Stockham&#x27;s death in 1912, the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office issued a moratorium, citing an express mandate of Pope Pius XII. It noted that several contemporary writers, in discussing married life, had described, praised, and even ventured to recommend something they termed &quot;a reserved embrace&quot;, and forbade priests and spiritual directors ever to suggest that there was otherwise. On October 29, 1951 in his &quot;allocution to midwives&quot;, Pope Pius XII citing Pope Pius XI&#x27;s Encyclical &quot;Casti connubii&quot; of December 31, 1930 declared

[...] that every attempt of either husband or wife in the performance of the conjugal act or in the development of its natural consequences which aims at depriving it of its inherent force and hinders the procreation of new life is immoral; and that no &quot;indication&quot; or need can convert an act which is intrinsically immoral into a moral and lawful one.
This precept is in full force today, as it was in the past, and so it will be in the future also, and always, because it is not a simple human whim, but the expression of a natural and divine law.

<doc id="722906" wikidata="Q6014831" url="?curid=722906" title="Inclusio">
<text>In biblical studies, inclusio is a literary device similar to a refrain. It is also known as bracketing or an envelope structure or figure, and consists of the repetition of material at the beginning and end of a section of text.

The purpose of an inclusio may be structural - to alert the reader to a particularly important theme - or it may serve to show how the material within the inclusio relates to the inclusio itself. Campbell notes that the first occurrence of the repeated material may not appear to the reader as being the start of an inclusio: it is at the second occurrence the repetition might be identified: &quot;it takes an attentive audience to keep them in mind&quot;.

==In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament)==
Inclusio is one of a number of repetitive devices in Hebrew poetry, including parts of the Old Testament.

Particularly noteworthy are the many instances of &quot;inclusio&quot; in the Book of Jeremiah. A rather far-flung example of &quot;inclusio&quot; in the Book of Jeremiah can be found in its first section, chapters 1–24, which are enveloped both by a similar question in the first and last episode (1:11, 24:3), and by similar imagery—that of almond rods and baskets of figs. &quot;Inclusio&quot; may also be found between chapters 36 and 45, both of which mention Baruch ben Nerya, to whom Jeremiah&#x27;s prophecies were entrusted. &quot;Bracketing&quot; can also be seen in The Lord&#x27;s sayings in 1:10 and 24:6. Indeed, the whole book save for its last (52nd) chapter—which some claim was appended to it—can be thought of as inside the &quot;inclusio&quot; formed by 1:1 and 51:64, both of which mention the preaching of Jeremiah (דברי ירמיה), thus implying the lateness of chapter 52; although analyzing whether so trivial a measure has any meaning but that which appeases the eye is best left to the astute reader. None of this is to say that the shorter forms of inclusio—those in which the section enframed is quite shorter—are not found in the Book of Jeremiah. An example is found in Jeremiah 4:22, which reads:

The phrase &quot;לא ידעו&quot; (&quot;did not know&quot;) is found at the beginning and the end of The Lord&#x27;s analysis of his people. English translations do not preserve this structure.

Inclusio also abounds in other books of the Bible. The first and last (29th) verses of Psalm 118, &quot;הודו לה&#x27; כי-טוב כי לעולם חסדו&quot;, form an inclusio. Another, more disputed, example may be found in the Book of Ruth, where one finds a certain resemblance, if somewhat chiastic, between 1:1 and 1:22: in the former, Elimelekh leaves Bethlehem in favor of Moab, and in the latter Ruth and Naomi leave Moab in favor of Bethlehem. In the visions of the prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 1:8-6:8), an inclusio has been identified, as the whole world is at peace as the visions commence, and at the end the four spirits of heaven go out in all directions and peace is imposed on &quot;the north country&quot;. Finally, it has been suggested that Genesis 2 contains inclusio, for the male is created at the start of the passage and the female at the end, providing textual evidence for the parallels between the two.

==In Rabbinic Literature==
The rabbis of the Talmud were aware of occurrences of inclusio in the Bible, as shown by Rabbi Yohanan&#x27;s comment in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 10a that &quot;Any psalm dear to David he opened with &quot;Ashrei&quot; (&quot;happy is he) and closed with &quot;Ashrei&quot;. Redactors of rabbinic document frequently made use of inclusio to mark off the endpoints of literary units of different sizes and possibly to suggest conceptual connections between seemingly disparate statements. At the end of the Mishnah, tractate Kelim, Rabbi Yose explicitly notes the phenomenon: &quot;Happy are you, Kelim, in that you opened with [statements regarding] impurity and departed with [statements regarding] purity.&quot; Tractate Berakhot, which opens with a discussion of the laws of reciting the Shema Yisrael (&quot;Hear O Israel&quot;) passage from Deuteronomy 6:4-9, concludes with a homiletic interpretation of the second verse from this passage (v. 5), showing how the ritual recitation of the tractate&#x27;s opening may serve as a source of spiritual instruction at the tractate&#x27;s end. The Mishna in tractate Nazir is framed by allusions to two famous biblical Nazirites - Samson (Nazir 1:2) and Samuel (Nazir 9:5), representing respectively negative and positive exemplars of this institution.

Many chapters of Mishnah are also framed by inclusio. In the opening mishnah of Taanit, Rabbi Joshua notes that rain on the festival of Sukkot is &quot;not a sign of blessing&quot;, and the closing mishnah of the chapter notes that rainfall after the month of Nisan is &quot;a sign of curse&quot;. This characterization of rainfall as God&#x27;s way of communicating His blessings and curses is a central theme of the chapter. Sometimes the inclusio is based on a wordplay. Ohalot Chapter 7 opens with a discussion of corpse impurity in a &quot;nefesh atuma&quot; (&quot;solid monument&quot;) and closes with the statement that a baby whose head has emerged from the womb may not be killed to save the mother because &quot;ayn dochin nefesh mipnei nefesh&quot; (&quot;one soul may not be set aside in favor of another&quot;). The use of the word &quot;nefesh&quot; at the beginning and the end of the chapter in opposite meanings, symbolizing respectively death and life, emphasize the interconnection between the mysteries of birth and of death.

Examples of inclusio may be found in later rabbinic literature as well. Tosefta Makkot Chapter 3 opens and closes with statements regarding the designation of three cities of refuge. Homilies regarding Isaiah 32:20 appear at the beginning and end of tracate Bava Kamma Chapter 1. The opening homily of Leviticus Rabba 29 asserts that the fate of Adam on the day of his creation is a sign for his children annually on the same date, and the closing homily of this section asserts that when Israel observes the commandments of this day God will regard them as having been created anew. Rabbinic redactors, following in the footsteps of their biblical predecessors, continued to employ inclusio as a literary marker and tool.

==In the New Testament==
The New Testament also uses inclusio. The main teaching part in the Sermon on the Mount starts and ends with the expression &quot;the Law and the Prophets&quot; (Matthew 5:17 and 7:12). Matthew&#x27;s account of the first part of Jesus&#x27; public ministry is framed by an account on his teaching and his miracles (Matthew 4:23 and 9:35). Also, Matthew&#x27;s Gospel begins with the prophecy that Jesus&#x27; name would be &quot;Emmanuel, that is, &#x27;God with us,&#x27;&quot; (1:23, in which the author has linked Isaiah 7:14 and 8:8, 10 together) and it ends with the promise, &quot;I am with you always, to the end of the age&quot;. This forms an inclusio about Jesus in his relationship to his people that suggests his deity. The Letter to the Hebrews uses Jeremiah&#x27;s prophecy as an inclusio in 8:8-12 and 10:16-18. There are many more examples of this literary device in the New Testament.

A case of inclusio occurs in the Gospel of Mark&#x27;s treatment of the &quot;cursing of the fig tree&quot; and the &quot;cleansing of the Temple&quot; (chapter 11). By giving the first half of the story before the account of the cleansing of the Temple, and the conclusion afterwards, Mark creates a &quot;frame&quot; which effectively highlights that he wants the cleansing of the Temple to be seen in light of the cursing of the fig tree - i.e. Jesus&#x27; actions in the Temple are not just a reform measure, but a judgment against it.

==In Latter-day Saints Scripture==
Wording in the Second Book of Nephi, where Nephi begins and ends his writing on the &quot;small plates&quot;, has been seen as an &quot;inclusio&quot;: the term &quot;good&quot; is used three times. Matthew Bowen notes that &quot;This repetition at the opening and closing of his account constitutes a framing device sometimes called &quot;inclusio&quot; or an envelope figure&quot;.

Another example is cited in the Book of Alma where Alma the Younger teaches his son about the doctrine of the resurrection, framing the passage in chapter 40, verses 22-24 by an inclusio.

<text>Pirkei Avot (; also transliterated as &quot;Pirqei Avoth&quot; or &quot;Pirkei Avos&quot; or &quot;Pirke Aboth&quot;), which translates to English as Chapters of the Fathers, is a compilation of the ethical teachings and maxims from Rabbinic Jewish tradition. It is part of didactic Jewish ethical literature. Because of its contents, the name is sometimes given as Ethics of the Fathers. Pirkei Avot consists of the Mishnaic tractate of &quot;Avot&quot;, the second-to-last tractate in the order of Nezikin in the Mishnah, plus one additional chapter. Avot is unique in that it is the only tractate of the Mishnah dealing &quot;solely&quot; with ethical and moral principles; there is relatively little halakha (laws) in Pirkei Avot.

==Translation of the title==
In the title &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;, the word &quot;pirkei&quot; is Hebrew for &quot;chapters of&quot;.

The word &quot;avot&quot; means &quot;fathers&quot;, and thus &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot; is often rendered in English as &quot;Chapters of the Fathers&quot;, or (more loosely) &quot;Ethics of the Fathers.&quot; This translation engenders an appealing and not entirely mistaken image of &quot;patriarchal teachings&quot;. 

However, the term &#x27;avot&#x27; is not usually used as an honorary designation for &#x27;rabbis&#x27; or &#x27;sages&#x27;; in rabbinical usage, it refers to the Patriarchs of the Bible. Rather, in the Mishnah, the word &quot;avot&quot; generally refers to fundamentals or principal categories. (Thus, the principal categories of creative work forbidden on Shabbat are called &quot;avot melacha&quot;, and the principal categories of ritual impurity are referred to as &quot;avot&quot; &quot;tum&#x27;ah&quot;.) Using this meaning, &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot; would translate to &quot;Chapters of Fundamental Principles&quot;. Additionally, the possibility that the title was intentionally worded to support multiple renderings—both &quot;fathers&quot; and &quot;fundamental principles&quot;—cannot be ruled out.

The recognition of ethical maxims as &#x27;Fundamental Principles&#x27; may derive from the high regard in which the Torah, Mishnah, and Talmud hold such wisdom. &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself,&quot; states the Bible (), an injunction that Rabbi Akiva in Genesis Rabbah 24:7 famously calls a &quot;great principle&quot; of the Torah. In Shabbat 31a, Hillel, when challenged by a prospective convert to explain the entire Torah while the latter stood on one foot, answered: &quot;That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: This is the entire Torah, the rest is the explanation, go now and learn it.&quot; (This maxim is not included in Pirkei Avot.) The attribution of Biblical Wisdom books to King Solomon (e.g., Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Book of Wisdom) attests also to the central importance that Jews of this period placed on transmitting the ethical way of life.

==Structure of the work==
The Mishnaic tractate &quot;Avot&quot; consists of five chapters. It begins with an order of transmission of the Oral Tradition; Moses receives the Torah at Mount Sinai and then transmits it through various generations (including Joshua, the Elders, and the Neviim, but notably not the Kohanim), whence it finally arrives at the Great Assembly, i.e., the early generations of Sages (Avot 1:1). It contains sayings attributed to sages from Simon the Just (200 BCE) to shortly after Judah haNasi (200 CE), redactor of the Mishnah. These aphorisms concern proper ethical and social conduct, as well as the importance of Torah study.

The first two chapters proceed in a general chronological order, with the second focusing on the students of Yochanan Ben Zakkai. Chapters Three and Four are thematic and contain various attributed sayings in no explicit order. Chapter Five departs from the organization and content of the preceding four in that it consists mostly of anonymous sayings structured around numerical lists, several of which have no direct connection with ethics. The last four paragraphs of this chapter return to the format of moral aphorisms attributed to specific rabbis.

In liturgical use, and in most printed editions of &quot;Avot&quot;, a sixth chapter, &quot;Kinyan Torah&quot; (&quot;Acquisition of Torah&quot;) is added; this is in fact the eighth (in the Vilna edition) chapter of tractate &quot;Kallah&quot;, one of the minor tractates. It is added because its content and style are somewhat similar to that of the original tractate Avot (although it focuses on Torah study more than ethics), and to allow for one chapter to be recited on each &quot;Shabbat&quot; of the Omer period, this chapter being seen well-suited to &quot;Shabbat Shavuot&quot;, when the giving of the Torah is celebrated. (See below.) The term &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot; refers to the composite six-chapter work (&quot;Avot&quot; plus &quot;Kinyan Torah&quot;).

Modern scholars suggest that Avot 5:21 (&quot;He would say: A five-year-old proceeds to Bible [study], a ten-year-old to mishna [study]...&quot;) was not authored by Rabbi Yehudah ben Teimah (the author of 5:20, and seemingly the referent of &quot;He would say&quot; in 5:21) but rather by Shmuel ha-Katan, and was not part of the Mishna tractate of Avot, but rather added later to Pirkei Avot. In Machzor Vitry, for example, this passage is printed after the words &quot;Tractate Avot has ended&quot;.

&quot;The structure of the tractate differs greatly from the thematic structure of the other tractates and Avot sayings employ a highly stylized language instead of the clear and straightforward mishnaic prose. In addition, the anomalous character of Avot is heightened by the biblical influences on its linguistic expressions, grammatical forms, and vocabulary.&quot;

==Study of the work==
From at least the time of Saadia Gaon (10th century), it has been customary to study one chapter a week on each Shabbat between Passover and Shavuot; today, the tractate is generally studied on each &quot;Shabbat&quot; of the summer, from Passover to Rosh Hashanah, the entire cycle repeating a few times with doubling of chapters at the end if there are not a perfect multiple of six weeks. The tractate is therefore included in many prayer books, following Shabbat afternoon prayers.

In the course of such study, it is common to preface each chapter with the Mishnaic saying, &quot;All Israel has a share in the world to come&quot; (Sanhedrin 10:1), and to conclude each chapter with the saying, &quot;The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to bestow merit upon Israel; therefore he gave them Torah and mitzvot in abundance&quot; (Makkoth 3:16).

==Notable sayings==
The tractate includes several of the most frequently-quoted rabbinic sayings on a variety of topics, including:

===Show kindness to others===
* &quot;The world stands on three things: On Torah, on works, and on kindness to others&quot; (1:2; work here translates &quot;avodah&quot; in the Hebrew which can mean labor, service of God, prayer, or sacrificial offerings)
* &quot;Your house should be open wide, and you should treat the poor as members of your household.&quot; (1:5)
* &quot;Meet every person with graciousness.&quot; (1:15)
* &quot;He [Yohanan ben Zakkai] said to [his disciples]: &#x27;Go and see what is the right way that a man should seek for himself.&#x27; Rabbi Eliezer said: &#x27;A good eye&#x27;. Rabbi Yehoshua said: &#x27;A good friend&#x27;. Rabbi Yose HaKohen said: &#x27;A good neighbor&#x27;. Rabbi Shimon [ben Netanel] said: &#x27;One who sees consequences.&#x27; Rabbi Elazar said: &#x27;A good heart&#x27;. He [Yohanan] said to them, &#x27;I prefer the words of Elazar ben Arach to yours, because his words include yours as well.&#x27;&quot; (2:13)

===Respect the other person&#x27;s rights===
* &quot;What is the right path a man should choose? Whatever is honorable to himself, and honorable in the eyes of others.&quot; (2:1)
* &quot;Let your friend&#x27;s honor be as dear to you as your own.&quot; (2:15)
* &quot;The evil eye, the evil inclination, and hatred of [God&#x27;s] creatures drive a person out of the world.&quot; (2:16)
* &quot;Let your friend&#x27;s money be as dear to you as your own.&quot; (2:17)

===Strive for greatness===
* &quot;If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for myself, what am &#x27;I&#x27;? And if not now, when?&quot; (1:14) This saying is written in simple and terse Hebrew and is attributed to the sage Hillel, who was famous for succinct expression. 
* &quot;What is the right path a man should choose? Whatever is honorable to himself, and honorable in the eyes of others.&quot; (2:1)
* &quot;In a place where there are no worthy men, strive to be worthy.&quot; (2:5)
* &quot;He who acquires a good name, has acquired himself something indeed.&quot; (2:8)
* &quot;Do not regard yourself as an evil person.&quot; (2:18)

===Respect God===
* &quot;Do His will as if it were your own, so that He will do your will as if it were His. Nullify your own will before His so that He will nullify the will of others before you.&quot; (2:4)

===Seek peace===
* &quot;Be amongst the students of Aaron: Love peace and pursue peace. Love people and bring them close to Torah.&quot; (1:12)
* &quot;The more charity, the more peace&quot; (2:8)

===Take precaution to avoid transgressions===
* &quot;Make a fence for the Torah&quot; (1:1)
* &quot;Keep far from an evil neighbor, do not befriend a wicked person, and do not despair of divine retribution&quot; (1:7)
* &quot;Evaluate the loss of fulfilling a commandment against its reward, and the reward of committing a transgression against its loss. Consider three things, and you will not come to sin: Know what is above you: a seeing eye, a hearing ear, and all of your deeds written down in a book.&quot; (2:1)

===Be humble===
* &quot;Love work, and do not admire official positions, and do not become too acquainted with the governing power.&quot; (1:10)
* &quot;One who seeks to make his name great, destroys it&quot; (1:13)
* &quot;Anyone who works for the community, let your work with them be for the sake of Heaven... And as for you all, I will make your reward great as though you had accomplished all the work.&quot; (2:2)
* &quot;Be wary regarding the ruling power, because they only befriend a person for their own purposes; they appear as friends when it suits them, but they do not stand by a man in his time of need.&quot; (2:3)
* &quot;Do not separate yourself from the community, and do not be sure of yourself until your day of death.&quot; (2:4)
* &quot;The more flesh, the more worms. The more possessions, the more worry. The more wives, the more witchcraft. The more maidservants, the more licentiousness. The more manservants, the more theft.&quot; (2:8)
* &quot;If you have learned much Torah, do not flatter yourself about it, because it was for this purpose you were created.&quot; (2:8)
* &quot;Let all your deeds be for the sake of Heaven.&quot; (2:12)

===Be intent in prayer===
* &quot;Be careful when reciting the Shema and regarding prayer. Do not pray as though by rote, but plead for mercy and grace before God.&quot; (2:18)

===Combine Torah learning with labor===
* &quot;Torah learning is best combined with an occupation, because the effort of both will keep one from sin. Torah study alone without work will in the end be nullified and lead to sin.&quot; (2:2) (See &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;.)
* &quot;Reduce your business activities and occupy yourself with the Torah instead, and be of a humble spirit before everyone.&quot; (4:10)
* &quot;If there is no Torah study, there is no worldly involvement (derech eretz); if there is no worldly involvement, there is no Torah study. ... If there is no flour, there is no Torah; if there is no Torah, there is no flour.&quot; (3:21)

===Do not exploit your learning===
* &quot;One who exploits the crown (of scholarship) will pass away&quot; (1:13)

===Be careful with speech===
* &quot;All my life I was raised amongst the Sages, and I never found anything better for a person than silence... one who talks too much causes sin.&quot; (1:17)
* &quot;Do not speak (excessively) much with women. This regards a man&#x27;s own wife, how much more so regarding another man&#x27;s wife!&quot; (1:5)
* &quot;Sages, you should be careful in what you say, lest you be punished with exile and be sent to a place of evil waters, and your pupils who follow you will die, and the name of Heaven will be disgraced.&quot; (1:11)
* &quot;Say little and do much.&quot; (1:15)
* &quot;Do not say something that cannot be understood, thinking it will be understood later.&quot; (2:5)

===Do not seek rewards===
* &quot;Do not be like slaves who serve the master in order to obtain a reward. Rather, be like slaves who serve the master not to receive a reward. And let the fear of Heaven be upon you.&quot; (1:3)
* &quot;Be as careful in observance of a minor commandment as in a major commandment, because you don&#x27;t know the respective rewards for the commandments.&quot; (2:1)

===Do not judge another person===
* &quot;Judge every person favorably&quot; (1:6)
* &quot;Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place.&quot; (2:4)

===Be fair and deliberate in legal decision===
* &quot;[When judging,] do not act as an advocate. When litigants stand before you, regard them [both] as guilty. And when they leave you, regard them as meritorious, provided that they have accepted your judgment.&quot; (1:8)
* &quot;Be thorough in examining witnesses, and watch what you say, so they do not learn from you how to lie.&quot; (1:9)
* &quot;On three things the world continues to exist: On justice, truth, and peace.&quot; (1:18)

===The time for action is now===
* &quot;If not now, when?&quot; (1:14)
* &quot;The main thing is not study, but doing.&quot; (1:17)
* &quot;Do not say &#x27;I will study when I have the time&#x27;, for perhaps you will never have time.&quot; (2:5)
* &quot;The day is short, the labor vast, the workers idle, the reward great, and the Employer is insistent.&quot; (2:20), attributed to Rabbi Tarfon
* &quot;It is not incumbent upon you to complete the work, but neither are you at liberty to desist from it&quot; (2:21), attributed to Rabbi Tarfon

===Patience===
* &quot;An ignoramus cannot be sin-fearing, and a boor cannot be pious. A shy person cannot learn, and an impatient person cannot teach.&quot; (2:6)
* &quot;Do not be quick to anger.&quot; (2:15)

===The punishment matches the sin===
* &quot;He saw a skull floating on the water, and said to it, &#x27;Because you drowned others, they drowned you. And they will also eventually be drowned because they drowned you.&#x27;&quot; (2:7)

==Commentaries and translations==

Mishnaic tractates, composed in Mishnaic Hebrew, are usually accompanied by commentaries in Aramaic known as gemara (&quot;the teaching&quot;). Unlike the majority of Mishnaic tractates, &quot;Avot&quot; has no corresponding &quot;gemara&quot;. Some have said this is because the concepts in it can never be dealt with completely, being the &quot;fifth part of the Shulchan Aruch&quot; (being intrinsically &quot;derekh eretz&quot;: wise practices).

Although Avot does not have an accompanying gemara, one of the minor tractates of the Talmud, the &quot;Avot of Rabbi Natan&quot;, is an expansion of the Mishnaic tractate containing numerous additional ethical teachings and legends.

The number of medieval and modern commentaries on the Tractate of Avot is large, and probably not known accurately. Among the best-known commentaries are the following:
* Samson Raphael Hirsch, &quot;Commentary on Pirkei Avot&quot;
* Yonah Gerondi on &quot;Avot&quot;
* Maimonides, on &quot;Avot&quot;, the introduction is known as &quot;The Eight Chapters&quot;

A comprehensive bibliography of Hebrew commentaries on Pirke Avot has been published, including over 1500 detailed entries. The appendix lists over 500 additional books that contain a short segment on Avot, and over 400 published references on Avot in general or individual mishnayot.

===Translations===

The Russian-American poet and translator Yehoash published his Yiddish translation of Pirkei Avot in 1912 under the title &quot;Di Lehren fun di Foters&quot;. This translation was subsequently included in a trilingual (Hebrew-Yiddish-English) edition that was published in 1921.
A Chinese translation of Pirkei Avot by Prof. Ping Zhang from Tel Aviv University was published in 1996 by CASS Press, together with footnotes and an introduction of Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz. The first edition, of 1500 copies, sold out immediately. A revised version of Zhang&#x27;s translation, with some influence from the Chinese Catholic Bible, was published in 2001 under the title (&#x27;Jewish sacred teachings, records, and ethics articles&#x27;). It is available online.

==Intertextuality==

Scholars have noted similar themes and language shared between Pirkei Avot and earlier Jewish traditions found in the Gospels, such as the parallel descriptions of &quot;where two or three are gathered&quot; used in the Gospel of Matthew for Jesus, and in Avot 3:2 for the Shekhinah.

<text>Walter Robert John Swinburn (7 August 1961 – 12 December 2016) was a flat racing jockey and trainer who competed in Great Britain and internationally.

==Biography==

Swinburn was born in Oxford. He was the son of Wally Swinburn, who won the Irish flat racing Champion Jockey title in 1976 and 1977 and was the first jockey to record over 100 winners in an Irish flat season. Nicknamed the &quot;Choirboy&quot;, he rode his first winner, Paddy&#x27;s Luck, on 12 July 1978 at Kempton Park but gained considerable fame for riding the superstar Shergar to victory in The Derby in 1981 by a record 10 lengths. Swinburn went on to win the Derby two more times.

In 1983, he rode All Along to victory in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe then the filly captured 1983 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year honors with three straight major event wins in North America: the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel, Maryland, the Canadian International Stakes (Rothmans International) at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, and the Turf Classic at Aqueduct Racetrack in Jamaica, New York. In 1996 he rode Pilsudski to victory in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf at Woodbine Racetrack and the Grosser Preis von Baden at Iffezheim Racecourse in Baden-Baden, Germany.

Swinburn spent four days in a coma after a fall in 1996, which was thought to have caused him to develop epilepsy, and he retired from racing in 2000.

==Trainer==

After retiring as a winner of numerous Group One races, including eight British Classics, Swinburn began working as a licensed trainer in 2004 and operated Walter Swinburn Racing Stables based at Church Farm in Aldbury, Tring, Hertfordshire. At the end of the 2011 UK Flat Season Walter Swinburn gave up his flat training licence.

==Personal life==
Swinburn married Alison Harris, the daughter of Peter Harris, a retired horse trainer, entrepreneur and multimillionaire in 2002. They had two daughters, Claudia and Camilla. His family home was Stocks House at Aldbury, a golf spa hotel and resort purchased by Harris in 2004 and converted for domestic use.

Swinburn died in London on 12 December 2016 at the age of 55. An inquest in January 2017 heard that Swinburn had fallen from a bathroom window, and the coroner ruled his death an accident.

<doc id="722923" wikidata="Q485032" url="?curid=722923" title="Sergei Bagapsh">
<text>Sergei Uasyl-ipa Bagapsh (4 March 1949 – 29 May 2011) was an Abkhaz politician who served as the second President of Abkhazia from 12 February 2005 until his death on 29 May 2011. He previously served as Prime Minister of Abkhazia from 1997 to 1999. He was re-elected in the 2009 presidential election. Bagapsh&#x27;s term as prime minister included the 1998 war with Georgia, while he oversaw both the recognition of Abkhazia by Russia and the Russo-Georgian War during his presidency.

Born in 1949 in Sukhumi, Bagapsh became a businessman following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as well as a representative of Abkhazian interests in Russia. Bagapsh became Prime Minister of Abkhazia in 1997, overseeing a brief, but successful, war with Georgia during a high point of tensions and the displacement of 30,000 Georgian civilians. In 2004, Bagapsh founded the United Abkhazia party in opposition to then-President Vladislav Ardzinba.

The same year, Bagapsh ran for President against Raul Khajimba, Ardzinba&#x27;s choice, and originally was forecast as losing to Khajimba. A political crisis followed, with the Supreme Court of Abkhazia declaring Bagapsh the winner and protests against the election both by supporters of Bagapsh and Khajimba. The two eventually ran on a national unity ticket, with Bagapsh becoming President and Khajimba becoming Vice President in 2005.

As President, Bagapsh lobbied for the international recognition of Abkhazia, eventually receiving recognition from Russia in 2008 following the successful capture of the Kodori Valley in the Russo-Georgian War by Russian and Abkhazian forces. Following the country&#x27;s recognition by Russia, widespread investment by Russian businesses and pressure to privatise assets drew both support and criticism. Bagapsh won a second term against Khajimba before dying of heart failure on 29 May 2011, due to complications from a surgery to remove cancerous growths on his lung.

==Early life and career==
Sergei Bagapsh was born on 4 March 1949 at Sukhumi in the Georgian SSR. Throughout most of his life, he had lived in Abkhazia. In his youth, Bagapsh was a member of the Georgian basketball team. Bagapsh graduated from the Georgian State University of Subtropical Agriculture in Sukhumi. During his studies he worked first, in a wine cooperative and later as a security guard for the state bank. In 1972, he fulfilled his military service, worked as the head of a sovkhoz following which he became instructor with the Abkhazian regional committee of the Komsomol.

In 1978, Bagapsh became responsible for information in the central committee of the Komsomol&#x27;s Georgian branch and in 1980, first secretary of the Abkhazian Regional Committee. In 1982, Sergei Bagapsh became secretary general of the Communist Party in the Ochamchira District. After the fall of communism, Bagapsh became a businessman and the representative of the Abkhazian government in Moscow. From 1995 until 1997, Bagapsh was First Deputy Prime Minister of Abkhazia. On 9 November 1995, Bagapsh was seriously wounded in an attack.

==Prime minister==
Sergei Bagapsh was appointed to the office of Prime Minister of Abkhazia on 29 April 1997.

Georgian-Abkhazian tensions during Bagapsh&#x27;s term in office reached a height in May 1998, following attacks by Georgian insurgents on peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Subsequently, a military conflict erupted between CIS and Georgian insurgent forces. In the subsequent war, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;, Abkhazian forces eliminated the insurgents, and 30,000 Georgian civilians fled Abkhazia.

==2004 presidential election==
From 2000 until 2004, Sergei Bagapsh was the managing director of the Abkhazian state-owned power company Chernomorenergo. During the same period, he began to emerge as a likely opposition candidate in the lead-up to the 2004 presidential election. In early 2004, he became one of three leaders of the newly founded opposition party, United Abkhazia. On 20 July 2004, United Abkhazia joined forces with Amtsakhara, another important opposition party, and the two named him as their joint candidate for the coming October presidential elections, beating out other hopefuls, such as former foreign minister Sergey Shamba.

In the elections, Bagapsh and his main opponent, Raul Khajimba, disputed the results. The Abkhaz Electoral Commission originally declared Khajimba to be the winner, with Bagapsh a distant second, but the Supreme Court later found that Bagapsh had actually won with 50.3% of the vote. The court reversed its decision when Khajimba&#x27;s supporters stormed the court building. At one point, Bagapsh and his supporters threatened to hold their own inauguration on 6 December 2004. However, in early December, Bagapsh and Khajimba reached an agreement to run together on a national unity ticket. New elections were held on 12 January 2005, with this ticket easily winning. Under the agreement, Bagapsh ran for president and Khajimba ran for vice-president.

Following Bagapsh&#x27;s election, Russia placed an imports ban on Abkhazia, leading to several tangerines destined for Russian markets rotting at the border. The presidential election and subsequent political crisis was termed by some, including the BBC, as the &quot;Tangerine Revolution&quot;, both as a reference to the Rose Revolution in Georgia the year prior and Abkhazia&#x27;s tangerines.

== Recognition of Abkhazia by Russia ==
In August 2008, the Russo-Georgian War began following the 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis. Following the war, Abkhazia gained control over the Kodori Valley, as well as recognition by Russia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Following Russia&#x27;s recognition of Abkhaz independence, Russian businesses began to invest extensively within the country, particularly in real estate, infrastructure, and energy. Pressure began mounting on Bagapsh from Russian sources to hasten economic privatisation in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics, while Abkhazian political opponents accused him of selling off Abkhazian assets.

==2009 Presidential election==
Bagapsh first addressed the matter of his candidacy in the 12 December 2009 presidential election when, during a press conference in Moscow on 18 April 2009, he announced that he would probably make use of his constitutional right to run for a second term. Bagapsh was nominated on 27 October by United Abkhazia, with Prime Minister Alexander Ankvab of Aitaira as his vice presidential candidate. On 18 November, Bagapsh received the additional support of the Communist Party of Abkhazia.

==Death==

In May 2011, cancerous growths were discovered on Bagapsh&#x27;s lung. On 21 May, Bagapsh underwent surgery in a Moscow clinic. Though the growths were successfully removed, Bagapsh died on 29 May due to heart failure that resulted from what was described as &quot;complications&quot; from the surgery. After the surgery, doctors discovered he had cancer. Alexander Ankvab took over as acting president with an election scheduled to be held on 26 August.

===Reactions===
Abkhaz parliament speaker Nugzar Ashuba told Russian state television that, although the death was completely unexpected, the situation remains calm.

Russian president Dmitry Medvedev offered his condolences saying: &quot;Bagapsh was a loyal supporter of friendship and alliance with Russia, and he tirelessly worked to deepen close bilateral ties between our countries.&quot;

==Legacy==

A state commission was installed to perpetuate the memory of Sergei Bagapsh. On 26 January 2012, the City Council of Sukhumi unanimously accepted a proposal by Mayor Alias Labakhua to rename the Square of the Constitution of the USSR after Bagapsh.

<doc id="722930" wikidata="Q5693180" url="?curid=722930" title="Heat (professional wrestling)">
<text>In professional wrestling, heat can refer to both crowd reactions and real-life animosity between those involved in a professional wrestling angle, or match.

In terms of crowd reaction, heat is usually used to denote how much of a reaction a heel wrestler receives, but can also be used for a babyface. Although the term can in some contexts refer to either positive or negative crowd reactions, heat is usually used specifically to mean a negative crowd response (e.g. booing), with its opposite being a &quot;pop&quot; or positive reaction (cheering, clapping, etc.).

As heat typically refers to a negative reaction that a wrestling character gets from a crowd in a performance setting, it has also become slang for a negative reaction that a wrestler gets backstage from colleagues, management or both. Backstage heat can be garnered for both real and perceived slights and transgressions.

== Cheap ==
Heels can draw &quot;cheap heat&quot; (called &quot;cheap&quot; because it is an easy way for the villains to receive boos) by blatantly insulting the fans, a local sports team, or the town in which they are performing. Fan favorites would sometimes do the equivalent, referred to as a &quot;cheap pop&quot;, by referring to the town (which Mick Foley popularized) or promising to &quot;win one for the fans&quot;. The villains can also draw cheap heat by referring to a mainstream news event as part of their promo, especially if the event has strongly emotional or political ramifications (e.g. a natural disaster), although they sometimes do not mention it by name. Historically, another common practice of villains to draw cheap heat involves using racial and ethnic slurs to offend the collective sensibility of wrestling fans. For example, in 1972, when the American Indian Movement was gaining momentum, Baron von Raschke was known to refer to Native American WWA World Heavyweight Champion Billy Red Cloud as a &quot;dirty low down Injun&quot; as a means of drawing cheap heat.

Another example of a wrestler using cheap heat was Sgt. Slaughter, who often delivered anti-American promos during the Gulf War (and Operation Desert Shield immediately before it) as part of his Iraqi sympathizer gimmick; one of those promos came at the 1990 Survivor Series, where Slaughter insulted servicemen stationed in Iraq for Thanksgiving. In 2003, The Rock used the Lakers-Kings rivalry to gain cheap heat during a WWE Raw show in Sacramento (The Rock even claimed that he was friends with Laker star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal) when he was singing a song about leaving the city; the song&#x27;s last lyrics were: &quot;I&#x27;ll be sure to come back when the Lakers beat the Kings in May.&quot; In 2004 during a WWE live event in Germany, John Bradshaw Layfield used Nazi salutes and was booed heavily by the crowd. In April 2006 during his feud with Shawn Michaels, Mr. McMahon used religion and the city to get heat from the crowd in St. Louis, Missouri by saying he went to hell that morning when his driver &quot;got lost and ended up in East St. Louis&quot;.

More recent examples include CM Punk and Paul Heyman in March 2013 mocking through displays of flippancy and disrespect towards Paul Bearer (who had just died), stealing his trademark urn and with Punk going as far as assaulting The Undertaker and constantly beating him with the urn (with Heyman being dressed up as Bearer) before then boldly opening the urn and emptying its contents over a fallen Undertaker. In November 2015, Paige mocked then Divas Champion Charlotte about her late younger brother Reid.

In October 2018 at Key Arena in Seattle, WA, Elias and Kevin Owens received over six minutes of continuous booing after mocking the city&#x27;s loss of the SuperSonics basketball team to Oklahoma City.

== Canned ==
&quot;Canned heat&quot; refers to playing a recording of cheering or booing through the arena sound system or adding it to a taped show, to either amplify a crowd reaction or mask silence from the crowd. Pre-taped crowd reactions from other events are also spliced in with the programming to make the crowd look more energetic than it actually is, or if promoters want a storyline to go in a particular direction.

For example, in early 1992 the World Wrestling Federation was attempting to push Sid Justice as a villain. During the Royal Rumble match in January, Justice – who had become popular due to his charisma – was loudly cheered when he eliminated Hulk Hogan, and commentators Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan and Gorilla Monsoon picked up on this as a fair act. However, the reaction was edited in future television replays, with Sid being booed heavily and Monsoon describing him as a &quot;jerk.&quot;

Before &quot;SmackDown&quot; went live in 2016, WWE usually overdubbed cheers on it and professional wrestling magazine &quot;Power Slam&quot; joked that the company has had to &quot;fire up the Fake Crowd Roar Machine™ to add an artificial atmosphere&quot;. This was particularly done for Roman Reigns, who was heavily booed at the time despite being booked as a babyface.

Gillberg&#x27;s entrance mocked on this concept, which features pre-recorded &quot;Gillberg&quot; chants in reference to accusations of World Championship Wrestling using pre-recorded crowd chants in entrances of the wrestler Gillberg parodies, Bill Goldberg.

This concept would end up being used outside of professional wrestling such as the National Hockey League during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs as the COVID-19 pandemic hit United States and Canada that impacted the sporting world. The crowd noise was provided by Electronic Arts, combined with recordings of team-specific chants by season ticketholders of participating teams in bubble cities in Edmonton and Toronto (the latter of which was also played in-arena). Similarly, in the National Football League, Fox lead commentator Joe Buck in an interview with Andy Cohen stated that the network had not ruled out the possibility of using artificial crowd noise on its telecasts for the 2020 season to make up for the possibility of limited or no attendance at games, and that Fox was also exploring the possibility of masking empty stands with CGI crowds. WWE would later follow up on the concept by installing LED boards on Amway Center and later Tropicana Field, branded as WWE ThunderDome on-screen and mixing arena&#x27;s audio with that of the virtual fans when the promotion began moving tapings from the WWE Performance Center in August 2020.

== Go home ==
&quot;Go home heat&quot; (sometimes called &quot;go away heat&quot; or &quot;nuclear heat&quot;) occurs when fans boo or jeer a legitimately disliked character or, sometimes, the wrestler playing that character. Go home heat can be given to wrestlers who are viewed negatively, either for their booking, their character, or even their actions outside of the show; thus, both heroes and villains can get this kind of heat. However, nuclear heat can also mean a heel character getting genuine disdain from fans, simply from great character work. This is much less common in the present day, as fans may be more clued in to the inner workings of professional wrestling, and this type of heat is transformed into a pop. This is due to smarks realizing how good the character work is, and cheering instead of booing.

Generally speaking, go home heat happens either because the fans feel the promotion has been too aggressively pushing a certain wrestler (regardless of his character alignment) who they feel is undeserving of their push, or because the character has become stale, boring, and uninteresting. While it can be difficult to distinguish the good heat for the villain from go away heat, with some fans and critics claiming it is indeed go away heat and others claiming it is good heat, there are a few example which are closer to be go away heat, most notably in WWE because of its major exposure. Notorious examples of the concept are The Rock as Rocky Maivia, X-Pac (who popularized the term in the early 2000s so much that go away heat is also known as &quot;X-Pac heat&quot;), Triple H, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, Lita, Stephanie McMahon, Michael Cole in 2011, and more recently Roman Reigns (see Persona and reception of Roman Reigns), Baron Corbin, Gable Steveson, Nia Jax, Logan Paul, Karrion Kross, Austin Theory, and Charlotte Flair.

=== Rocky Maivia ===
Between 1996 and 1997, Rocky Maivia was the first major example of go away heat and also the best example of turning the go away heat into a star by 1998. Hyped as the WWF&#x27;s first third-generation wrestler, Maivia was a clean-cut heroic character who was pushed heavily from the start and won the Intercontinental Championship despite his wrestling inexperience. This was during a transitional, but more edgy period that would lead to the Attitude Era, therefore audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of &quot;Die, Rocky, die!&quot; and &quot;Rocky sucks!&quot; being heard during his matches. After suffering a legit injury in April 1997, Maivia would return as a villain character in August 1997 by joining the Nation of Domination and refusing to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, insulting the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers. The Rock would eventually become the Nation&#x27;s leader and draw good heat, then starting getting cheered while still being a villain before being officially turned back into a fan favorite character by September 1998. During his time in the Nation, The Rock would get back the Intercontinental Championship and held it for 265 days (the second longest in the 1990s and the longest until Gunther in 2022), with his second reign being better reviewed and the ladder match in which he lost the title to Triple H at SummerSlam being rated ****1/4 out of five stars by journalist Dave Meltzer of &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; (&quot;WON&quot;).

Despite now getting the desired reaction, the WWF would turn him back into a villain (from November 1998 to April 1999) to feud with Mankind (Mick Foley) and become the top villain to main event WrestleMania XV as WWF Champion and drop the title to the company&#x27;s &quot;poster boy&quot; Stone Cold Steve Austin. In April 1999, The Rock would turn back into a heroic character and would become one of the most successful characters of both the Attitude Era and WWE history. Despite getting some mixed reactions and being booed a few times in 2001 and 2002, most notably against Austin in the main event of WrestleMania X-Seven at Austin&#x27;s home state, &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania X8 and Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam, The Rock would never draw go away heat and would instead use both the fans turning on him and him getting more successful in his actor career to turn back into a villain in 2003 to end his full-time career, before becoming once again a fan favorite ever since 2004.

=== X-Pac ===
During the Invasion storyline, where the WWF side (to which X-Pac belonged) was mostly portrayed as the heroes, the fans were vocal in their disapproval of X-Pac, which was acknowledged on-screen by both Alliance member Billy Kidman and later by WWF member Edge. This mass disapproval led to the term &quot;X-Pac heat&quot; as described above.

=== Triple H ===
Between 1999 and 2001, Triple H had a successful run as the main villain of the WWF—especially in 2000, when he became the first villain to win the main event of WrestleMania and thus retain the WWF Championship, as well as winning the &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; award by both &quot;PWI&quot; (with Kurt Angle) and &quot;WON&quot; (with Mick Foley) and the &quot;WON&quot; &quot;Wrestler of the Year&quot; award due his accomplishments and performances. Dave Meltzer would rank Triple H&#x27;s drawing power as the number one of the 2000s.

However, by late 2002 he would be criticized for the Katie Vick angle with Kane, with his following feuds with Scott Steiner and Booker T being criticized as well. Thus his &quot;reign of terror&quot; with the World Heavyweight Championship (he was the inaugural holder, being awarded the title by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff in September 2002) by December 2002 to September 2003 would often being described as go away heat due to his mediocre angles and matches.

As result of his go away heat, between 2002 and 2004 Triple H would win the &quot;Worst Feud of the Year&quot; with Kane (including the &quot;Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic&quot;), as well as the &quot;Worst Worked Match of the Year&quot; (with Scott Steiner in January 2003) and being voted by &quot;WON&quot;&#x27;s readers as the &quot;Most Overrated&quot; (2002–2004) and the &quot;Readers&#x27; Least Favorite Wrestler&quot; (2002 and 2003). It would stay with him despite getting in a better physical condition and thus having better matches and feuds by 2004—due to him winning the title five times for a total of 616 days—until he put over Batista (whose storyline building and eventual feud was highly acclaimed, winning the &quot;WON&quot; &quot;Feud of the Year&quot; award) at WrestleMania 21, Backlash and Vengeance. After his Hell in a Cell match with Batista at Vengeance, Triple H was given a standing ovation. Triple H would be getting cheered during his feud with Cena in 2006 despite still being a villain, which would lead to his return as a fan favorite.

=== John Bradshaw Layfield ===
John Bradshaw Layfield&#x27;s push in 2004 that would change him from a predominantly tag team division competitor to a SmackDown! main eventer who went on to hold the WWE Championship for 280 days (the longest reign in a decade) is often seen as go away heat due to the push being perceived as forced and undeserving. It was noted that Layfield&#x27;s push came at a time where SmackDown!&#x27;s talent roster was short of heel main eventers due to Brock Lesnar leaving the company and Kurt Angle due once again suffering from legitimate neck problems. It came to light that then-reigning WWE Champion and top babyface Eddie Guerrero felt a lot of pressure as he felt he was responsible for the drop in crowd attendance at SmackDown!&#x27;s live events at the time and wanted to drop the title. Layfield would not improve things on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; during his reign and actually drew even less than Guerrero. Furthermore, Layfield&#x27;s matches on pay-per-view were not well received, including his WrestleMania 21 match with John Cena in which he lost the title. However, the subsequent rematch between Layfield and Cena in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Judgment Day was better received.

=== Stephanie McMahon ===
As a villainess, Stephanie McMahon has been able to draw many boos, but her run with The Authority since 2013, as well as her run as Raw Commissioner, has been criticized and critics and fans alike saw her heat during this period as go away heat.

=== Hulk Hogan ===
Hulk Hogan, the face of the WWF that would lead to a boom in professional wrestling during the 1980s, may be included as well due to receiving less positive reactions by the early 1990s, including the Sid incident at the 1992 Royal Rumble, and even getting some boos, especially in his early years with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). This was mostly due to a stale character, which was turned as a villain in July 1996, becoming the leader of the New World Order (nWo) and eventually turning back into a fan favorite in 1999.

===John Cena===
Curiously, the last two WWE wrestlers billed as &quot;the face of the company&quot; or &quot;the top guy&quot; (John Cena and Roman Reigns) have been linked to have had go away heat, as both have in common the fact to be billed as heroic characters and staying as such despite getting jeers for years, unlike Rocky Maivia who was turned into a villain less than a year after his failed run as fan favorite. Cena had a brief run as a villain between late 2002 and late 2003, when he was turned back into a fan favorite to acclaim, much like The Rock in 1998. Cena would also win his first world title to a pop from the crowd, eventually surpassing Batista&#x27;s popularity in 2005 that would see him being moved from SmackDown to the Raw brand. By mid-2005, a change of character not appreciated by fans would see Cena changing from &quot;The Doctor of Thuganomics&quot; (a rapper) to a more clean-cut character (described by Cena as a &quot; Superman&quot;) who would often &quot;overcome the odds&quot;, thus getting his first boos and jeers. In the following years, Cena would get mostly real &quot;mixed reaction&quot; rather than go away heat, oftentimes still getting more cheers than boos, with the notorious exception of Rob Van Dam&#x27;s Money in the Bank cash-in at ECW&#x27;s One Night Stand (with ECW being Van Dam&#x27;s &quot;home promotion&quot;), Tables, Ladders and Chairs match against Edge at Unforgiven in Edge&#x27;s hometown and against CM Punk at Money in the Bank in CM Punk&#x27;s hometown. Eventually, by the 2010s he would be reevaluated (ironically, also due Reigns being described as &quot;even worse&quot;) and getting more cheers, especially during his run as United States Champion in 2015 and even when winning his 16th world championship against popular and respected veteran AJ Styles at the Royal Rumble in January 2017.

=== Roman Reigns ===

Reigns, while actually debuting on WWE&#x27;s main roster as a villain in November 2012, would never actually have a villain single run due to debuting as part of The Shield. By late 2013, Reigns would be getting the biggest push between the three members of The Shield (Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins), as he got to win as sole survivor his Survivor Series 5-on-5 Survivor Series match and the most elimination at 4, being the only member of The Shield to defeat CM Punk and breaking another record at the Royal Rumble for the most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble match at 12, also eliminating both Ambrose and Rollins from the match and ending up being the runner-up (Reigns would get cheered over eventual winner Batista, as fans wanted fan favorite and popular Daniel Bryan to win instead of Batista), being eventually billed as the leader of The Shield during their feud with Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton and Triple H) between April and May 2014. After The Shield broke up in June 2014, the heroic Ambrose and the now villain Rollins would change their ring attire and theme music (unlike Reigns, who retained much of The Shield&#x27;s aesthetic including ring attire, a remixed version of the group&#x27;s theme music and ring entrance), eventually evolving their characters during their high acclaimed feud that won the &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; (&quot;PWI&quot;) award for the &quot;Feud of the Year&quot;. While Ambrose was being voted by &quot;PWI&quot;&#x27;s reader as the &quot;Most Popular Wrestler of the Year&quot; in 2014 and 2015 and Rollins as both the &quot;Wrestler of the Year&quot; and the &quot;Most Hated Wrestler of the Year&quot; in 2015, Reigns had finished in second place for the &quot;WON&quot; &quot;Most Overrated&quot; award in both 2014 and 2015. When breaking up The Shield, WWE thought Reigns was the most popular between the three and thus pushed Reigns in the main event, immediately going after the world title. However, as soon as his singles career on WWE&#x27;s main roster started, Reigns&#x27; positive reactions started to diminish, culminating in Orton getting cheered over him during their match at SummerSlam. After suffering a legit incarcerated hernia in September 2014, Reigns&#x27; positive crowd reactions following his return in December further diminished, culminating in Reigns &quot;getting booed out of the building&quot; after winning the 2015 Royal Rumble.

For those arguing that Reigns is getting go away heat, their reason is due his perceived forced push, as he would headline WrestleMania 31 after wrestling only two singles matches on pay-per-view despite having a &quot;very limited&quot; in-ring moveset, &quot;forced promo delivery&quot; and a &quot;petulant and annoyed&quot; attitude ill-befitting of a top fan favorite. Reigns&#x27; first coronation was set to happen in the main event of WrestleMania 31, but WWE ultimately decided to go with Rollins cashing-in his Money in the Bank contract and win the title to avoid further negative reactions towards Reigns. Reigns would eventually win three world titles and two consecutive WrestleMania main events (against Triple H at WrestleMania 32 and The Undertaker at WrestleMania 33) despite the continuing negative reactions by both critics and fans alike, which has led &quot;PWI&quot; readers to vote him as &quot;Most Hated Wrestler of the Year&quot; for 2016, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. It should also be noted that &quot;business went up&quot; with Cena, who has been also one of the best merchandising seller in WWE history, whereas the period in which WWE tried to push Reigns as the new face of the company and gave him multiple coronations at WrestleMania saw a much quicker decline in &quot;Raw&quot; viewership by late 2015, when Reigns was made the number one contender for the world title in October and eventually winning the title three times between November 2015 and April 2016.

In August 2018 at SummerSlam, the audience started out giving Reigns a mixed crowd reaction during his entrance, but upon winning the WWE Universal Championship from Brock Lesnar, Reigns was cheered. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Reigns was again booed early in the show, but received a mixed reaction for suggesting that he defend his newly won championship against Finn Bálor later that night. After beating Bálor, Reigns was again heavily booed by the crowd, which increased in intensity after the match when Braun Strowman attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank title shot. The subsequent Shield reunion and attack on Strowman was positively received by the Brooklyn audience, but was viewed by many as a cheap attempt to garner positive reactions for Reigns.

However, all the heat diminished as of the October 22, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Reigns announced that he was re-diagnosed with leukemia after 11 years and would be taking a hiatus to treat it. As a result, he relinquished the Universal Championship, ending his reign of 64 days. Reigns initially received a mixed reaction upon entering the arena, but was welcomed with a positive reception after his announcement of leukemia was made.

<doc id="722940" wikidata="Q1061259" url="?curid=722940" title="Johnny Murtagh">
<text>Johnny Murtagh (born 14 May 1970) is an Irish flat racing trainer and former jockey from Bohermeen, near Navan, Kells, County Meath. As a jockey he won many of the major flat races in Europe, including all the Irish Classics, all the Group 1 Races at Royal Ascot, The Derby, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes and Europe&#x27;s biggest race the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. He was also Irish flat racing Champion Jockey five times. As a trainer, based at stables near Kildare, he has saddled a winner at Royal Ascot and an Irish Classic winner.

==Background==
Murtagh was born in Navan, County Meath. He was a keen amateur boxer as a young boy and was once Irish boy&#x27;s under-14 boxing champion. He also came close to joining Blackburn Rovers&#x27; youth football team.

At a boxing fight one evening in his native County Meath, a spectator advised his mother that Murtagh had the attributes to make a good jockey, balance, poise, weight, strength, courage. His mother wrote to the Racing Academy and Centre of Education (RACE) in County Kildare, a school for apprentice jockeys, and got a two-week trial for her son. He was one of 26 successful candidates who progressed onto the RACE 10-month course. At the end of the course, he was apprenticed to John Oxx, one of Ireland&#x27;s leading trainers.

==Career as jockey==
Murtagh rode his first winner, Chicago Style, at Limerick in 1987.

He became stable jockey to Oxx in 1992, and from then until his departure in 2003, rode 18 Group 1 winners for Oxx&#x27;s leading owner, the Aga Khan.

For Oxx, Murtagh rode Sinndar to win The Derby and Irish Derby, as well as the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in 2000. He won the Derby again on the Michael Bell trained Motivator. Murtagh was also the regular jockey for talented filly Soviet Song. In 2004, the partnership won two Group 1 races, including the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. Here she beat a strong field of colts, including the 2,000 Guineas winner Haafhd.

From 2008 to 2010, he was stable jockey for Coolmore, taking over from the drug-banned Kieren Fallon. He had been riding for them on an ad-hoc basis since 2002, most notably winning the Derby on High Chaparral in 2002. In 2008, he rode 19 Group 1 winners in a single season for O&#x27;Brien (21 in total for Coolmore), and followed it up in 2009 with another 10, including the Irish Derby, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, Sussex Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup, St. James&#x27;s Palace Stakes and an Irish 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas double.

He resigned his post as stable jockey to Coolmore in November 2010, issuing a statement via his agent to say he had informed Coolmore he wouldn&#x27;t be renewing his contract. No reason was given but there was speculation that O&#x27;Brien was looking for another jockey, and on his recent return from the Breeders Cup at Churchill Downs, where he had ridden four losers for O&#x27;Brien, one bookmaker had been offering odds on his replacement. His last Group 1 winner for the team was Roderic O&#x27;Connor in the Criterium International at Saint-Cloud on 31 October 2010.

This meant he was back riding for Oxx who trained 90 of the Aga Khan&#x27;s horses, and additionally for Mick Halford who trained 30.

&quot;I am thrilled to be renewing my association with His Highness&#x27; horses in Ireland,&quot; Murtagh said in a statement, &quot;We have shared some fantastic moments over the years and I have always enjoyed riding in the green and red colours. This will also give me an opportunity to ride for John Oxx again. I started off riding for Mr Oxx and it has always been a pleasure to be part of his Currabeg team&quot;.

In February 2014, Murtagh announced that he would retire from riding to concentrate on his training career.

==Career as trainer==
Murtagh obtained his trainer&#x27;s licence in 2013. In his first season he achieved a Group 2 and two Group 3 wins, including the Blandford Stakes with Belle de Crecy and the British Champions Long Distance Cup with Royal Diamond, riding the horses himself. His first Group 1 winner as a trainer was Champers Elysees in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in September 2020. His first win at Royal Ascot as a trainer came in 2021, when Create Belief, ridden by stable jockey Ben Coen, won the Sandringham Stakes. Later that season, Sonnyboyliston provided the trainer with his first Irish Classic win when Coen rode him to victory in the Irish St. Leger.

==Personal life==
He is married to Orla, daughter of famous Tipperary hurler Michael &quot;Babs&quot; Keating, and has five children, Caroline, Charles, Lauren, Grace and Tom.

<text>In association football, the formation of a team refers to the position players take in relation to each other on a pitch. As association football is a fluid and fast-moving game, a player&#x27;s position (with the exception of the goalkeeper) in a formation does not define their role as tightly as that of rugby player, nor are there breaks in play where the players must line up in formation (as in gridiron football). A player&#x27;s position in a formation typically defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role, and whether they tend to play centrally or towards one side of the pitch. 

Formations are usually described by three or more numbers in order to denote how many players are in each row of the formation, from the most defensive to the most advanced. For example, the &quot;4–5–1&quot; formation has four defenders, five midfielders, and a single forward. The choice of formation is normally made by a team&#x27;s manager or head coach. Different formations can be used depending on whether a team wishes to play more attacking or defensive football, and a team may switch formations between or during games for tactical reasons. Teams may also use different formations for attacking and defending phases of play in the same game. 

In the early days of football, most team members would play in attacking roles, whereas modern formations are generally split more evenly between defenders, midfielders, and forwards.

==Terminology==
Formations are described by categorising the players (not including the goalkeeper) according to their positioning along (not across) the pitch, with the more defensive players given first. For example, 4–4–2 means four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards.

Traditionally, those within the same category (for example the four midfielders in a 4–4–2) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, this is not the case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4–2–1–3, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4–3–3. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4–1–2–1–2, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered to be a kind of 4–4–2 (specifically a 4–4–2 diamond, referring to the lozenge shape formed by the four midfielders).

The numbering system was not present until the 4–2–4 system was developed in the 1950s.

Diagrams in this article use a &quot;goal keeper at the bottom&quot; convention but initially it was the opposite. The first numbering systems started with the number 1 for the goalkeeper (top of diagrams) and then defenders from left to right and then to the bottom with the forwards at the end.

==Historical formations==
In the football matches of the 19th century, defensive football was not played, and the line-ups reflected the all-attacking nature of these games.

In the first international game, Scotland against England on 30 November 1872, England played with seven or eight forwards in a 1–1–8 or 1–2–7 formation, and Scotland with six, in a 2–2–6 formation. For England, one player would remain in defence, picking up loose balls, and one or two players would roam the midfield and kick the ball upfield for the other players to chase. The English style of play at the time was all about individual excellence and English players were renowned for their dribbling skills. Players would attempt to take the ball forward as far as possible and only when they could proceed no further, would they kick it ahead for someone else to chase. Scotland surprised England by actually passing the ball among players. The Scottish outfield players were organized into pairs and each player would always attempt to pass the ball to his assigned partner. Ironically, with so much attention given to attacking play, the game ended in a 0–0 draw.

===Pyramid (2–3–5) ===
The first long-term successful formation was recorded in 1880. In &quot;Association Football&quot;, however, published by Caxton in 1960, the following appears in Vol II, page 432:
&quot;Wrexham ... the first winner of the Welsh Cup in 1877 ... for the first time certainly in Wales and probably in Britain, a team played three half-backs and five forwards ...&quot;

The 2–3–5 was originally known as the &quot;Pyramid&quot;, with the numerical formation being referenced retrospectively. By the 1890s, it was the standard formation in England and had spread all over the world. With some variations, it was used by most top-level teams up to the 1930s.

For the first time, a balance between attacking and defending was reached. When defending, the halfback-trio were the first facing opposing forwards; when those were surpassed, then fullbacks met forwards as the last line of defence.

The centre halfback had a key role in both helping to organise the team&#x27;s attack and marking the opponent&#x27;s centre forward, supposedly one of their most dangerous players.

This formation was used by Uruguay to win the 1924 and 1928 Olympic Games and also the 1930 FIFA World Cup.

It was this formation which gave rise to the convention of shirt numbers increasing from the back and the right.

====Danubian school====
The Danubian school of football is a modification of the 2–3–5 formation in which the centre forward plays in a more withdrawn position. As played by Austrian, Czechoslovak and Hungarian teams in the 1920s, it was taken to its peak by the Austrians in the 1930s. This school relied on short passing and individual skills, heavily influenced by the likes of Hugo Meisl and Jimmy Hogan, an English coach who visited Austria at the time.

=====Metodo (2–3–2–3)=====

The metodo was devised by Vittorio Pozzo, coach of the Italy national team in the 1930s. A derivation of the Danubian school, it can be called MM (if the goalkeeper is at the top of the diagram) or WW (if the goalkeeper is at the bottom). The system was based on the 2–3–5 formation; Pozzo realised that his half-backs would need some more support in order to be superior to the opponents&#x27; midfield, so he pulled two of the forwards to just in front of midfield, creating a 2–3–2–3 formation. This created a stronger defence than previous systems, as well as allowing effective counter-attacks. The Italy national team won back-to-back World Cups, in 1934 and 1938, using this system. It has been argued that Pep Guardiola&#x27;s Barcelona and Bayern Munich used a modern version of this formation. This formation is also similar to the standard in table football, featuring two defenders, five midfielders and three strikers (which cannot be altered as the &quot;players&quot; are mounted on axles).

===WM===

The WM formation, named after the letters resembled by the positions of the players on its diagram, was created in the mid-1920s by Herbert Chapman of Arsenal to counter a change in the offside law in 1925. The change had reduced the number of opposition players that attackers needed between themselves and the goal-line from three to two. This led to the introduction of a centre-back to stop the opposing centre-forward, and tried to balance defensive and offensive playing. The formation became so successful that by the late 1930s most English clubs had adopted the WM. Retrospectively, the WM has either been described as a 3–2–5 or as a 3–4–3, or more precisely a 3–2–2–3, reflecting the letters which symbolise it. The gap in the centre of the formation between the two wing halves ( Half backs ) and the two inside forwards allowed Arsenal to counter-attack effectively. The WM was subsequently adapted by several English sides, but none could apply it in quite the same way Chapman had. This was mainly due to the comparative rarity of players like Alex James in the English game. He was one of the earliest playmakers in the history of the game, and the hub around which Chapman&#x27;s Arsenal revolved. In 2016, new manager Patrick Vieira, a former Arsenal player, brought the WM formation to New York City FC. In Italian football, the WM formation was known as the , and its use in Italy later led to the development of the formation. The WM formation was used by West Germany during the 1954 FIFA World Cup. It antedates Pozzo&#x27;s Metodo and made more radical changes to the widely used system of that era: the 2–3–5 formation.

===WW===

The WW formation (also known as the MM formation, according to the current diagram convention, that is goalkeeper at the bottom. However, it is called the WW formation if the goalkeeper is depicted at the top as was customary at the time), was a development on the WM formation. It was created by Hungarian Márton Bukovi, who turned the 3–2–2–3/WM formation into a 3–2–3–2 by effectively turning the forward &quot;M&quot; upside down (that is M to W). The lack of an effective centre-forward in Bukovi&#x27;s team necessitated moving a forward back to midfield to create a playmaker, with another midfielder instructed to focus on defence. This transformed into a 3–2–1–4 formation when attacking and turned back to 3–2–3–2 when possession is lost. This formation has been described by some as somewhat of a genetic link between the WM and 4–2–4 and was also successfully used by Bukovi&#x27;s compatriot Gusztáv Sebes for the Hungarian Golden Team in the early 1950s.

===3–3–4===
The 3–3–4 formation was similar to the WW, with the notable exception of having an inside-forward (as opposed to centre-forward) deployed as a midfield schemer alongside the two wing-halves. This formation was commonplace during the 1950s and early 1960s. One of the best exponents of the system was Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s double-winning side of 1961, which deployed a midfield of Danny Blanchflower, John White and Dave Mackay. Porto won the 2005–06 Primeira Liga using this unusual formation under manager Co Adriaanse.

===4–2–4===

The 4–2–4 formation attempts to combine a strong attack with a strong defence, and was conceived as a reaction to the WM&#x27;s stiffness. It could also be considered a further development of the WW. The 4–2–4 was the first formation to be described using numbers.

While the initial developments leading to the 4–2–4 were devised by Márton Bukovi, the credit for creating the 4–2–4 lies with two people: Flávio Costa, the Brazilian national coach in the early 1950s, as well as another Hungarian, Béla Guttman. These tactics seemed to be developed independently, with the Brazilians discussing these ideas while the Hungarians seemed to be putting them into motion. The fully developed 4–2–4 was only &quot;perfected&quot; in Brazil, however, in the late 1950s.

Costa published his ideas, the &quot;diagonal system&quot;, in the Brazilian newspaper &quot;O Cruzeiro&quot;, using schematics and, for the first time, the formation description by numbers. The &quot;diagonal system&quot; was another precursor of the 4–2–4 and was created to spur improvisation in players.

Guttmann himself moved to Brazil later in the 1950s to help develop these tactical ideas using the experience of Hungarian coaches.

The 4–2–4 formation made use of the players&#x27; increasing levels of skill and fitness, aiming to effectively use six defenders and six forwards, with the midfielders performing both tasks. The fourth defender increased the number of defensive players but mostly allowed them to be closer together, thus enabling effective cooperation among them, the point being that a stronger defence would allow an even stronger attack.

The relatively empty midfield relied on defenders that should now be able not only to steal the ball, but also hold it, pass it or even run with it and start an attack. So this formation required that all players, including defenders, are somehow skilful and with initiative, making it a perfect fit for the Brazilian players&#x27; minds. The 4–2–4 needed a high level of tactical awareness, as having only two midfielders could lead to defensive problems. The system was also fluid enough to allow the formation to change throughout play.

The 4–2–4 was first used with success at the club level in Brazil by Santos, and was used by Brazil in their wins at the 1958 World Cup and 1970 World Cups, both featuring Pelé, and Mário Zagallo, the latter of whom played in 1958 and coached in 1970. The formation was quickly adopted throughout the world after the Brazilian success. Under the management of Jock Stein, Celtic won the 1966–67 European Cup and reached the final of the 1969–70 European Cup using this formation.

It was also used by Vladimír Mirka in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s victorious 1968 UEFA European Under-18 Championship campaign. He continued to use it after its waning days.

==Contemporary formations==
The following formations are used in modern football. The formations are flexible allowing tailoring to the needs of a team, as well as to the players available. Variations of any given formation include changes in positioning of players, as well as replacement of a traditional defender by a sweeper.

===4–4–2===

This formation was the most common in football in the 1990s and early 2000s, in which midfielders are required to work hard to support both the defence and the attack: typically one of the central midfielders is expected to go upfield as often as possible to support the forward pair, while the other will play a &quot;holding role&quot;, shielding the defence; the two wide midfield players must move up the flanks to the goal line in attacks and yet also protect the full-backs. On the European level, the major example of a team using a 4–4–2 formation was Milan, trained by Arrigo Sacchi and later Fabio Capello, which won three European Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, and three UEFA Super Cups between 1988 and 1995.

More recently, commentators have noted that at the highest level, the 4–4–2 is being phased out in favour of formations such as the 4–2–3–1. In 2010, none of the winners of the Spanish, English and Italian leagues, nor the Champions League, relied on the 4–4–2. Following England&#x27;s elimination at the 2010 World Cup by a 4–2–3–1 Germany side, England national team coach Fabio Capello (who was notably successful with the 4–4–2 at Milan in the 1990s) was criticised for playing an &quot;increasingly outdated&quot; 4–4–2 formation.

One reason for the partially discontinued use of the 4–4–2 formation at the highest level of the game is its lack of central dominance against other formations like a 4-3-3, due to having only 2 central midfielders. Being outnumbered in the central area of the pitch makes it more difficult to both obtain and retain the ball against formations that utilize three or more midfielders centrally. To combat these issues, variations of the classic formation have been created, such as the 4–1–2–1–2.

However, the 4–4–2 is still regarded as the best formation to protect the whole width of the field with the opposing team having to get past two banks of four and has recently had a tactical revival having recently contributed to Diego Simeone&#x27;s Atlético Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s Real Madrid and Claudio Ranieri&#x27;s Leicester City.

====4–4–1–1====

A variation of 4–4–2 with one of the strikers playing &quot;in the hole&quot;, or as a &quot;second striker&quot;, slightly behind their partner. The second striker is generally a more creative player, the playmaker, who can drop into midfield to pick up the ball before running with it or passing to teammates. Interpretations of 4–4–1–1 can be slightly muddled, as some might say that the extent to which one forward has dropped off and separated from the other can be debated.

===4–4–2 diamond or 4–1–2–1–2===

The 4–4–2 diamond (also described as 4–1–2–1–2) staggers the midfield. The width in the team has to come from the full-backs pushing forward. The defensive midfielder is sometimes used as a deep-lying playmaker, but needs to remain disciplined and protect the back four behind him. The central attacking midfielder is the creative player, responsible for picking up the ball, and distributing the ball wide to its full-backs or providing the two strikers with through balls. When out of possession, the midfield four must drop and assist the defence, while the two strikers must be free for the counter-attack. Its most famous example was Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s Milan, which won the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final and made Milan runners-up in 2005. Milan was obliged to adopt this formation so as to field talented central midfielder Andrea Pirlo, in a period when the position of offensive midfielder was occupied by Rui Costa and later Kaká. This tactic was gradually abandoned by Milan after Andriy Shevchenko&#x27;s departure in 2006, progressively adopting a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; formation.

====4–1–3–2====
The 4–1–3–2 is a variation of the 4–1–2–1–2 and features a strong and talented defensive centre midfielder. This allows the remaining three midfielders to play further forward and more aggressively, and also allows them to pass back to their defensive mid when setting up a play or recovering from a counterattack. The 4–1–3–2 gives a strong presence in the forward middle of the pitch and is considered to be an attacking formation. Opposing teams with fast wingers and strong passing abilities can try to overwhelm the 4–1–3–2 with fast attacks on the wings of the pitch before the three offensive midfielders can fall back to help their defensive line. Valeriy Lobanovskiy is one of the most famous exponents of the formation, using it with Dynamo Kyiv, winning three European trophies in the process. Another example of the 4–1–3–2 in use was the England national team at the 1966 World Cup, managed by Alf Ramsey.

===4–3–3===

The 4–3–3 was a development of the 4–2–4, and was played by the Brazil national team in the 1962 World Cup, although a 4–3–3 had also previously been used by the Uruguay national team in the 1950 and 1954 World Cups. The extra player in midfield allows a stronger defence, and the midfield could be staggered for different effects. The three midfielders normally play closely together to protect the defence, and move laterally across the field as a coordinated unit. The formation is usually played without wide midfielders. The three forwards split across the field to spread the attack, and may be expected to mark the opposition full-backs as opposed to doubling back to assist their own full-backs, as do the wide midfielders in a 4–4–2.

A staggered 4–3–3 involving a defensive midfielder (usually numbered four or six) and two attacking midfielders (numbered eight and ten) was commonplace in Italy, Argentina, and Uruguay during the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian variety of 4–3–3 was simply a modification of WM, by converting one of the two wing-halves to a &quot;libero&quot; (sweeper), whereas the Argentine and Uruguayan formations were derived from 2–3–5 and retained the notional attacking centre-half. The national team that made this famous was the Dutch team of the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, even though the team won neither.

In club football, the team that brought this formation to the forefront was the famous Ajax team of the early 1970s, which won three European Cups with Johan Cruyff, and Zdeněk Zeman with Foggia in Italy during the late 1980s, where he completely revitalised the movement supporting this formation. It was also the formation with which Norwegian manager Nils Arne Eggen won 15 Norwegian league titles.

Most teams using this formation now use a specialist defensive midfielder. Recent famous examples include the Porto and Chelsea teams coached by José Mourinho, as well as the Barcelona team under Pep Guardiola. Mourinho has also been credited with bringing this formation to England in his first stint with Chelsea, and it is commonly used by Guardiola&#x27;s Manchester City. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp employed a high-pressing 4–3–3 formation with dynamic full-backs and a potent front three (Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino) to win the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League.

====4–3–1–2====
A variation of the 4–3–3 wherein a striker gives way to a central attacking midfielder. The formation focuses on the attacking midfielder moving play through the centre with the strikers on either side. It is a much narrower setup in comparison to the 4–3–3 and is usually dependent on the attacking midfielder to create chances. Examples of sides which won trophies using this formation were the 2002–03 UEFA Cup and 2003–04 UEFA Champions League winners Porto under José Mourinho&#x27;s; and the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League and 2003–04 Serie A-winning Milan team, and 2009–10 Premier League winners Chelsea, both managed by Carlo Ancelotti. This formation was also adopted by Massimiliano Allegri for the 2010–11 Serie A title-winning season for Milan. It was also the favoured formation of Maurizio Sarri during his time at Empoli between 2012 and 2015, during which time they won promotion to Serie A and subsequently avoided relegation, finishing 15th in the 2014–15 Serie A season.

====4–1–2–3====
A variation of the 4–3–3 with a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and a fluid front three.

===4–3–2–1 (the &quot;Christmas tree&quot; formation)===

The , commonly described as the &quot;Christmas tree&quot; formation, has another forward brought on for a midfielder to play &quot;in the hole&quot;, so leaving two forwards slightly behind the most forward striker.

Terry Venables and Christian Gross used this formation during their time in charge of Tottenham Hotspur. Since then, the formation has lost its popularity in England. It is, however, most known for being the formation Carlo Ancelotti used on-and-off during his time as a coach with Milan to lead his team to win the 2007 UEFA Champions League title.

In this approach, the middle of the three central midfielders act as a playmaker while one of the attacking midfielders plays in a free role. However, it is also common for the three midfielders to be energetic shuttlers, providing for the individual talent of the two attacking midfielders ahead. The &quot;Christmas tree&quot; formation is considered a relatively narrow formation and depends on full-backs to provide presence in wide areas. The formation is also relatively fluid. During open play, one of the side central midfielders may drift to the flank to add additional presence.

===4–2–3–1===

A flexible formation in prospects to defensive or offensive orientation, as both the wide players and the full-backs may join the attack. In defence, this formation is similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stop opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent&#x27;s defence will be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.

At international level, this formation is used by the Belgian, French, Dutch and German national teams in an asymmetric shape, and often with strikers as wide midfielders or inverted wingers. The formation is also currently used by Brazil as an alternative to the 4–2–4 formation of the late 1950s to 1970. Implemented similarly to how the original 4–2–4 was used back then, use of this formation in this manner is very offensive, creating a six-man attack and a six-man defence tactical layout. The front four attackers are arranged as a pair of wide forwards and a playmaker forward who play in support of a lone striker. Mário Zagallo also considers the Brazil 1970 football team he coached as pioneers of 4–2–3–1.

In recent years, with full-backs having ever more increasing attacking roles, the wide players (be they deep lying forwards, inverted wingers, attacking wide midfielders) have been tasked with the defensive responsibility to track and pin down the opposition full-backs. Manuel Pellegrini is an avid proponent of this formation, and frequently uses it in the football clubs that he manages.

This formation has been very frequently used by managers all over the world in the modern game. One particularly effective use of it was Liverpool under Rafael Benítez, who deployed Javier Mascherano, Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard in central midfield, with Gerrard acting in a more advanced role in order to link up with Fernando Torres, who acted as the central striker. Another notable example at club level is Bayern Munich under Jupp Heynckes at his treble-clinching 2012–13 season. Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, and Ange Postecoglou also use this formation. A high point of the 4–2–3–1 was in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where Raymond Domenech&#x27;s France and Luiz Felipe Scolari&#x27;s Portugal used it to great success, with Marcello Lippi&#x27;s victorious Italy squad also using a loose variation in a 4–4–1–1.

===4–2–2–2 (magic rectangle)===

Often referred to as the &quot;magic rectangle&quot; or &quot;magic square&quot;, this formation was used by France under Michel Hidalgo at the 1982 World Cup and Euro 1984, and later by Henri Michel at the 1986 World Cup and a whole generation, for Brazil with Telê Santana, Carlos Alberto Parreira and Vanderlei Luxemburgo, by Arturo Salah and Francisco Maturana in Colombia. The &quot;Magic Rectangle&quot; is formed by combining two box-to-box midfielders with two deep-lying (&quot;hanging&quot;) forwards across the midfield. This provides a balance in the distribution of possible moves and adds a dynamic quality to midfield play.

This formation was used by former Real Madrid manager Manuel Pellegrini and met with considerable praise. Pellegrini also used this formation while with Villarreal and Málaga. The formation is closely related to a 4–2–4 previously used by Fernando Riera, Pellegrini&#x27;s mentor, and that can be traced back to Chile in 1962 who (may have) adopted it from the Frenchman Albert Batteux at the Stade de Reims of 50s.
The 4–2–2–2 with a box midfield was deployed by the North Carolina Courage of the NWSL from 2017 to 2021, using a front four with freedom to fluidly switch sides and move wide while served by high-playing fullbacks. The Courage won the league in three consecutive seasons using the formation and the NWSL playoff championship twice, setting season records in wins, points, and goals scored in the process.

This formation had been previously used at Real Madrid by Vanderlei Luxemburgo during his failed stint at the club during the latter part of the 2004–05 season and throughout the 2005–06 season. This formation has been described as being &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and &quot;suicidal&quot;. Luxemburgo is not the only one to use this although it had been used earlier by Brazil in the early 1980s. At first, Telê Santana, then Carlos Alberto Parreira and Vanderlei Luxemburgo proposed basing the &quot;magic rectangle&quot; on the work of the wing-backs. The rectangle becomes a 3–4–3 on the attack because one of the wing-backs moves downfield.

In another sense, the Colombian 4–2–2–2 is closely related to the 4–4–2 diamond of Brazil, with a style different from the French-Chilean trend and is based on the complementation of a box-to box with 10 classic. It emphasises the triangulation, but especially in the surprise of attack.
The 4–2–2–2 formation consists of the standard defensive four (right back, two centre backs, and left back), with two centre midfielders, two support strikers, and two out and out strikers. Similar to the 4–6–0, the formation requires a particularly alert and mobile front four to function. The formation has also been used on occasion by the Brazil national team, notably in the 1998 World Cup final.

===4–2–1–3===
The somewhat unconventional 4–2–1–3 formation was developed by José Mourinho during his time at Inter Milan. He used it in all the teams he coached, including in the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final. By using captain Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso in holding midfield positions, he was able to push more players to attack. Wesley Sneijder filled the attacking midfield role and the front three operated as three strikers, rather than having a striker and one player on each wing. Using this formation, Mourinho won The Treble with Inter in only his second season in charge of the club.

As the system becomes more developed and flexible, small groups can be identified to work together in more efficient ways by giving them more specific and different roles within the same lines, and numbers like 4–2–1–3, 4–1–2–3 and even 4–2–2–2 occur.

Many of the current systems have three different formations in each third, defending, middle and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team in all parts of the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So, the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4–2–1–3 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack, it may look exactly like a 4–2–1–3.

===4–5–1===

4–5–1 is a conservative formation; however, if the two midfield wingers play a more attacking role, it can be likened to 4–3–3. The formation can be used to grind out 0–0 draws or preserve a lead, as the packing of the centre midfield makes it difficult for the opposition to build up play. Because of the &quot;closeness&quot; of the midfield, the opposing team&#x27;s forwards will often be starved of possession. Due to the lone striker, however, the centre of the midfield does have the responsibility of pushing forward as well. The defensive midfielder will often control the pace of the game.

===4–6–0===
A highly unconventional formation, the 4–6–0 is an evolution of the 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 in which the centre forward is exchanged for a player who normally plays as a &quot;trequartista&quot; (that is, in the &quot;hole&quot;). Suggested as a possible formation for the future of football, the formation sacrifices an out-and-out striker for the tactical advantage of a mobile front four attacking from a position that the opposition defenders cannot mark without being pulled out of position. Because of the intelligence and pace required by the front four attackers to create and attack any space left by the opposition defenders, however, the formation requires a very skilful and well-drilled front four. Due to these demanding requirements from the attackers, and the novelty of playing without a proper goalscorer, the formation has been adopted by very few teams, and rarely consistently. As with the development of many formations, the origins and originators are uncertain, but arguably the first reference to a professional team adopting a similar formation is Anghel Iordănescu&#x27;s Romania in the 1994 World Cup Round of 16, when Romania won 3–2 against Argentina. 

The first team to adopt the formation systematically was Luciano Spalletti&#x27;s Roma side during the 2005–06 Serie A season, mostly out of necessity as his &quot;strikerless&quot; formation, and then notably by Alex Ferguson&#x27;s Manchester United side that won the Premier League and Champions League in 2007–08. The formation was unsuccessfully used by Craig Levein&#x27;s Scotland against Czech Republic to widespread condemnation. At Euro 2012, Spain coach Vicente del Bosque used the 4–6–0 for his side&#x27;s 1–1 group stage draw against Italy and their 4–0 win versus Italy in the final of the tournament.

===3–4–3===

Using a 3–4–3, the midfielders are expected to split their time between attacking and defending. Having only three dedicated defenders means that if the opposing team breaks through the midfield, they will have a greater chance to score than with a more conventional defensive configuration, such as 4–5–1 or 4–4–2. However, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack. This formation is used by more offensive-minded teams. The formation was famously used by Liverpool under Rafael Benítez during the second half of the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final to come back from a three-goal deficit. It was also notably used by Chelsea when they won the Premier League under manager Antonio Conte in the 2016–17 season and when they won the 2021 UEFA Champions League Final under Thomas Tuchel.

===3–5–2===

This formation is similar to 5–3–2, but with some important tweaks: there is usually no sweeper (or &quot;libero&quot;) but rather three classic centre-backs, and the two wing-backs are oriented more towards the attack. Because of this, the most central midfielder tends to remain further back in order to help prevent counter-attacks. It also differs from the classical 3–5–2 of the WW by having a non-staggered midfield. There are several coaches claiming to be the inventors of this formation, like two-time European Cup winning manager and World Cup runner-up Ernst Happel and the unorthodox and controversial Nikos Alefantos, but the first to successfully employ it at the highest level was Carlos Bilardo, who led Argentina to win the 1986 World Cup using the 3–5–2. The high point of the 3–5–2&#x27;s influence was the 1990 World Cup, with both finalists, Bilardo&#x27;s Argentina and Franz Beckenbauer&#x27;s West Germany employing it.

In the last years of first decade of 2000, Gian Piero Gasperini during his years at Genoa (and later in Atalanta) using this tactical system, in a modern way, with high pressure, speed, strength, one on one defense and ball possession helped his revival. Later, also, Italian coach Antonio Conte successfully implemented the 3–5–2 at Juventus, having won three Serie A consecutive titles between 2012 and 2014, the first unbeaten (record in a league championship with 20 contestants) and the last reaching the points record (102). After coaching the Italy national team, Conte used again the 3–5–2 system at Chelsea during the 2016–17 Premier League season, leading the club to the league title and an FA Cup final. In order to properly counteract the additional forward pressure from the wing-backs in the system, other sides, including Ronald Koeman&#x27;s Everton and Mauricio Pochettino&#x27;s Tottenham, also used the formation against Chelsea. At international level, Louis van Gaal utilised 3–5–2 with the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup, in which they finished third. Notably, this formation was specifically employed as a counter to the challenge of possession football used by the Spanish national side. Cesare Prandelli used it for Italy&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Spain in the group stage of Euro 2012, with some commentators seeing Daniele De Rossi as a sweeper. The Netherlands used it to greater effect against Spain during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup, completing a 5–1 win. This minimised the Dutch weaknesses (inexperience in defence) and maximising their strengths (world-class forwards in Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben).

Simone Inzaghi, who succeeded Conte at Inter in 2021, has helped modernize and further innovate the 3–5–2. Inzaghi&#x27;s system builds ball possession through the goalkeeper and defenders and uses midfielders who are quick and technical and capable of defending very well. Particularly innovative was his use of side midfielders, called &quot;Quinti&quot; (&quot;fifths&quot;) such as Federico Dimarco. Dimarco was used in a very flexible way with defensive duties in the non-possession phase (playing in the defensive line in a 5–3–2 shape), but would shift in the offensive phase. The two midfield sidemen would go up on the line of the attackers forming a four-man attack in a 3–3–4 shape. In three seasons Inter six four trophies along with an appearance in the 2023 UEFA Champions League final.

===3–2–4–1===
Manager Pep Guardiola used this formation at times in his time at Manchester City, using one main centre-back and two defensive midfield anchors. It begins as a typical 4–2–3–1 formation, but differs in attack, with the left or right half-back sliding into a defensive midfield position, and a defensive midfielder sliding up to create the &quot;square&quot; in midfield. The formation helped Manchester City to win the UEFA Champions League for the first time, and the continental treble in the 2022–23 season.

===3–4–1–2===
3–4–1–2 is a variant of 3–5–2 where the wingers are more withdrawn in favour of one of the central midfielders being pushed further upfield into the &quot;number 10&quot; playmaker position. Martin O&#x27;Neill used this formation during the early years of his reign as Celtic manager, noticeably taking them to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. Portland Thorns used a 3–4–1–2 formation to win the 2017 NWSL championship, withdrawing forward Christine Sinclair into the playmaker role rather than moving a midfielder up. The Thorns transitioned to a 4–2–3–1 in 2018 after opposing teams countered the 3–4–1–2 with a stronger midfield presence.

===3–6–1===

This uncommon modern formation focuses on ball possession in the midfield. In fact, it is very rare to see it as an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or a draw. Its more common variants are 3–4–2–1 or 3–4–3 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on assisting with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down the clock. On the other hand, when the team is losing, at least one of the playmakers will more frequently play on the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. Steve Sampson (for the United States at the 1998 World Cup) and Guus Hiddink (for Australia at the 2006 World Cup) are two of the few coaches who have used this formation. Hiddink used the 3–3–3–1 formation for the Socceroos as well.

===3–3–1–3===
The 3–3–1–3 was formed of a modification to the Dutch 4–3–3 system Ajax had developed. Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff brought it to even further attacking extremes and the system eventually found its way to Barcelona, where players such as Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were reared into 3–3–1–3&#x27;s philosophy. It demands intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponent&#x27;s half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff&#x27;s variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. Marcelo Bielsa has used the system with some success with Argentina and Chile&#x27;s national teams, and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to use the system in competition today. Diego Simeone had also tried it occasionally at River Plate.

===3–3–3–1===
The 3–3–3–1 system is a very attacking formation and its compact nature is ideally suited for midfield domination and ball possession. It means a coach can field more attacking players and add extra strength through the spine of the team. The attacking three are usually two wing-backs or wingers with the central player of the three occupying a central attacking midfield or second striker role behind the centre forward. The midfield three consists of two centre midfielders ahead of one central defensive midfielder or alternatively one central midfielder and two defensive midfielders. The defensive three can consist of three centre backs or one centre back with a full back either side.

The 3–3–3–1 formation was used by Marcelo Bielsa&#x27;s Chile in the 2010 World Cup, with three centre-backs paired with two wing-backs and a holding player, although a variation is the practical hourglass, using three wide players, a narrow three, a wide three and a centre-forward.

===5-2-2-1===
The 5-2-2-1 formation in football is a defensive-oriented system with a focus on counter-attacking. It utilizes five defenders, including three center-backs and two wing-backs, two central midfielders, two attacking midfielders or inside forwards, and one striker at the top. The three center-backs provide a solid defensive foundation, while the wing-backs offer width and versatility by pushing forward to support attacks or dropping back to help in defense. The two central midfielders act as both defensive shields and playmakers, controlling the tempo and transitioning the play from defense to attack. The two attacking midfielders support the lone striker, often operating in spaces between the opposition’s defense and midfield to create chances.

One of the main strengths of this formation is its defensive stability combined with the ability to launch quick counter-attacks through the wing-backs and attacking midfielders. However, it can struggle against teams that overload the midfield, as only two central midfielders are responsible for controlling this area, potentially leaving gaps in ball possession.

===5–3–2===

This formation has three central defenders, possibly with one acting as a sweeper. This system merges the winger and full-back positions into the wing-back, whose job it is to work their flank along the full length of the pitch, supporting both the defence and the attack. At club level, the 5–3–2 was famously employed by Helenio Herrera in his Inter Milan side of the 1960s and 1970s, influencing many other Italian teams of the era. The Brazil team which won the 2002 FIFA World Cups also employed this formation with their wing-backs Cafu and Roberto Carlos two of the best known proponents of this position.

====5–3–2 with sweeper or 1–4–3–2====
A variant of the 5–3–2, this involves a more withdrawn sweeper, who may join the midfield, and more advanced full-backs. The 1990 world champion West German team was known for employing this tactic under Franz Beckenbauer, with his successor Berti Vogts retaining the scheme with some variations during his tenure.

===5–4–1===

This is a particularly defensive formation, with an isolated forward and a packed defence. Again, however, a couple of attacking full-backs can make this formation resemble something like a 3–6–1. One of the most famous cases of its use is the Euro 2004-winning Greek national team.

==Incomplete formations==
When a player is sent off (i.e. after being shown a red card) or leaves the field due to an injury or other reason with no ability to be replaced with a substitute, teams generally fall back to defensive formations such as 4–4–1 or 5–3–1. Often only when facing a negative result will a team with ten players play in a risky attacking formation such as 4–3–2, 3–4–2, or even 4–2–3. If one or more players are also sent off, teams often adopt all-out attacking or all-out defensive formations, depending on the score. If two players are sent off or hurt, the common formations are a 4-4 hoping to block attacks until the game is over, or a 4-3-1 where the 3 man midfield &amp; 1 man up front will slide across in defence and creating chances with long through balls hoping for the fast striker to beat the defence with speed.

<doc id="722963" wikidata="Q467784" url="?curid=722963" title="Gothic alphabet">
<text>The Gothic alphabet is an alphabet for writing the Gothic language. It was developed in the 4th century AD by Ulfilas (or Wulfila), a Gothic preacher of Cappadocian Greek descent, for the purpose of translating the Bible.

The alphabet essentially uses uncial forms of the Greek alphabet, with a few additional letters to express Gothic phonology:

* Latin F.
* A Runic letter to distinguish the glide from vocalic .
* The letter hwair () to express the Gothic labiovelar.

==Origin==
Ulfilas is thought to have consciously chosen to avoid the use of the older Runic alphabet for this purpose, as it was heavily connected with pagan beliefs and customs. Also, the Greek-based script probably helped to integrate the Gothic nation into the dominant Greco-Roman culture around the Black Sea.

==Letters==
Below is a table of the Gothic alphabet. Two letters used in its transliteration are not used in current English: thorn (representing ), and hwair (representing ).

As with the Greek alphabet, Gothic letters were also assigned numerical values. When used as numerals, letters were written either between two dots (•• = 12) or with an overline ( = 12). Two letters, (90) and (900), have no phonetic value.

The letter names are recorded in a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795). Most of them seem to be Gothic forms of names also appearing in the rune poems. The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.

Most of the letters have been taken over directly from the Greek alphabet, though a few have been created or modified from Latin and possibly (more controversially) Runic letters to express unique phonological features of Gothic. These are:

* - q; derived either from a form of Greek stigma/digamma (), or from a cursive variant of kappa (), which could strongly resemble a &quot;u&quot;.
* - þ; derived either from Greek phi (Φ) /f/ or psi (Ψ) /ps/ with phonetic reassignment, Runic , or a cursive form of Ⲑ from the 4th century.
* - j; derived from Latin G /ɡ/
* - u; possibly an allograph of Greek Ο (cf. the numerical values), or from Runic /u/)
* - ; potentially derived from Greek Θ /θ/ with phonetic reassignment; also potentially derived from Greek Ο /o/; possibly the letterform was switched with ; also possibly pictographic in nature, with O for rounding and • for aspiration.
* - o; derived either from Greek Ω or from Runic , or from a cursive form of Greek Ο, as such a form was more common for omicron than for omega in this time period, and as the sound values of omicron and omega had already merged by this time, though the idea that it was derived from omicron does not explain why omega and occupy the same numerical spot, the similarity between the Gothic alphabet ending with and the Greek alphabet ending with Φ Χ Ψ Ω, or the fact that the Gothic alphabet is ordered from to like the Greek alphabet being ordered from Α to Ω.
 (r), (s) and (f) appear to be derived from their Latin equivalents rather than from the Greek, although the equivalent Runic letters (, and ), assumed to have been part of the Gothic futhark, possibly played some role in this choice. However, Snædal claims that &quot;Wulfila&#x27;s knowledge of runes was questionable to say the least&quot;, as the paucity of inscriptions attests that knowledge and use of runes was rare among the East Germanic peoples. Miller refutes this claim, stating that it is &quot;not implausible&quot; that Wulfila used a runic script in his creation of the Gothic alphabet, noting six other authors—Wimmer, Mensel, Hermann, d&#x27;Alquen, Rousseau, and Falluomini—who support the idea of the Gothic alphabet having runic contributions. Some variants of (s) are shaped like a sigma and more obviously derive from the Greek Σ.

 (x) is only used in proper names and loanwords containing Greek Χ (&quot;xristus&quot; &quot;Christ&quot;, &quot;galiugaxristus&quot; &quot;Pseudo-Christ&quot;, &quot;zaxarias&quot; &quot;Zacharias&quot;, &quot;aiwxaristia&quot; &quot;eucharist&quot;).

Regarding the letters&#x27; numeric values, most correspond to those of the Greek numerals. Gothic takes the place of Ϝ (6), takes the place of ξ (60), that of Ο (70), and that of ψ (700).

==Diacritics and punctuation==
Diacritics and punctuation used in the Codex Argenteus include a trema placed on &quot;i&quot;, transliterated as &quot;ï&quot;, in general applied to express diaeresis, the interpunct (·) and colon (:) as well as overlines to indicate sigla (such as &quot;xaus&quot; for &quot;xristaus&quot;) and numerals.

==Unicode==
The Gothic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in March 2001 with the release of version 3.1.

The Unicode block for Gothic is – in the &quot;Supplementary Multilingual Plane&quot;. As older software that uses UCS-2 (the predecessor of UTF-16) assumes that all Unicode codepoints can be expressed as 16 bit numbers ( or lower, the &quot;Basic Multilingual Plane&quot;), problems may be encountered using the Gothic alphabet Unicode range and others outside of the &quot;Basic Multilingual Plane&quot;.

<text>Michael J. Kinane (born 22 June 1959) is an Irish former flat racing jockey. He had a 34-year career, retiring on 8 December 2009.

A prolific winner of the Irish, English and French Classic races over two decades, Kinane has ridden winners in the 2,000 Guineas four times, The Derby three times, the Melbourne Cup in Australia and, in the United States, the Belmont Stakes once. Kinane also has four wins in Breeders&#x27; Cup races. He has been Irish Champion Jockey on 13 occasions.

He first came to prominence as the stable jockey to Liam Browne winning the 1982 Irish 2000 Guineas and St James Palace Stakes at Ascot, both on Dara Monarch, and finishing 2nd in the 1983 Epsom Derby on Carlingford Castle, before moving to Dermot Weld. He was later retained by John Magnier and Aidan O&#x27;Brien as stable jockey at Ballydoyle for many years prior to joining leading Irish flat trainer John Oxx. He became one of the world&#x27;s elite jockeys and excelled on the big occasions at Longchamp and Epsom, and was regarded as one of the leading professionals of his sport.

He retired &quot;on an incredible high,&quot; in his own words, at the end of 2009, a season which witnessed him ride Sea The Stars to six Group One wins, including an unprecedented 2000 Guineas-Derby-Arc treble. He bred the 2007 Epsom Derby winner Authorized.

== Post-jockey career ==
Michael Kinane is current working for Hong Kong Jockey Club in Europe to select horses suitable for running in Hong Kong. Those horses are resold by Hong Kong Jockey Club in an auction.

==Personal life==
His father, Tommy Kinane, was a leading National Hunt jockey who won the Champion Hurdle on Monksfield.

<text>A Sámi drum is a shamanic ceremonial drum used by the Sámi people of Northern Europe. Sámi ceremonial drums have two main variations, both oval-shaped: a bowl drum in which the drumhead is strapped over a burl, and a frame drum in which the drumhead stretches over a thin ring of bentwood. The drumhead is fashioned from reindeer hide.

In Sámi shamanism, the &quot;noaidi&quot; used the drum to get into a trance, or to obtain information from the future, or other realms. The drum was held in one hand, and beaten with the other. While the &quot;noaidi&quot; was in trance, his &quot;free spirit&quot; was said to leave his body to visit the spirit-world. When used for divination, the drum was beaten with a drum hammer; a &quot;vuorbi&quot; (&#x27;index&#x27; or &#x27;pointer&#x27;), a kind of die made of brass or horn, would move around on the drumhead when the drum was struck. Future events would be predicted according to the symbols upon which the &quot;vuorbi&quot; stopped on the membrane.

The patterns on the drum membrane reflect the worldview of the owner and his family, both in religious and worldly matters, such as reindeer herding, hunting, householding, and relations with their neighbours and the non-Sámi community.

Many drums were taken out of Sámi ownership and use during the Christianization of the Sámi people in the 17th and 18th centuries. Many drums were confiscated by Sámi missionaries and other officials as a part of an intensified Christian mission towards the Sámi. Other drums were bought by collectors. Between 70 and 80 drums are preserved; the largest collection of drums is at the Nordic Museum in Stockholm.

== Terminology ==

The Northern Sámi terms for the drum are &quot;goavddis&quot;, &quot;gobdis&quot; and &quot;meavrresgárri&quot;, while the Lule Sámi and Southern Sámi terms are &quot;goabdes&quot; and &quot;gievrie&quot;, respectively. , ; In English it is also known as a rune drum or Sámi shamanic drum.

The Northern Sámi name &quot;goavddis&quot; describes a bowl drum, while the Southern Sámi name &quot;gievrie&quot; describes a frame drum, corresponding to the distribution of these types of drums. Another Northern Sámi name, &quot;meavrresgárri&quot;, is a cross-language compound word: Sámi &quot;meavrres&quot;, from &quot;meavrit&quot; and Finnish (&#x27;dig, roar, mess&#x27;), plus &quot;gárri&quot; from Norwegian (&#x27;cup, bowl&#x27;).

The common Norwegian name for the drum, &quot;runebomme&quot;, is based on an earlier misunderstanding of the symbols on the drum, which interpreted them as runes. Suggested new names in Norwegian are &quot;sjamantromme&quot; (&quot;shaman drum&quot;) or &quot;sametromme&quot; (&#x27;Sámi drum&#x27;). The original Swedish name, &quot;trolltrumma&quot;, comes from the Christian perception of Sámi religion as witchcraft (&quot;trolldom&quot;), and it is now considered derogatory. In his &quot;Fragments of Lappish Mythology&quot; (ca 1840) Læstadius used the term &quot;divination drum&quot; (&quot;spåtrumma&quot;). In Swedish today, the term that&#x27;s commonly used is (&#x27;the Sámi drum&#x27;).

== Sources on the history of the drums ==

There are four categories of sources for the history of the drums. First are the drums themselves, and what might be interpreted from them. Secondly, there are reports and treatises on Sámi subjects from the 17th and 18th centuries, written by Norwegian and Swedish priests, missionaries or other civil servants, like Johannes Schefferus. The third category are statements from Saami themselves, given to legal courts or other official representatives. The fourth are the sporadic references to drums and Sámi shamanism in other sources, such as &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot; (late 12th century).

The oldest mention of a Sámi drum and shamanism is in the anonymous &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot; (late 12th century). It mentions a drum with symbols of marine animals, a boat, reindeer and snowshoes. There is also a description of a shaman healing an apparently dead woman by moving his spirit into a whale. Peder Claussøn Friis describes a &quot;noaidi&#x27;s&quot; spirit leaving the body in his &quot;Norriges oc omliggende Øers sandfærdige Bescriffuelse&quot; (1632). The oldest description by a Sámi is by Anders Huitlok of the Pite Sámi in 1642 about a drum that he owned. Huitlok also made a drawing; his story was written down by the German-Swedish bergmeister Hans P. Lybecker. Huitlok&#x27;s drum represents a worldview where deities, animals and the living and the dead are working together within a given landscape. The court protocols from the trials against Anders Paulsen in Vadsø in 1692 and against Lars Nilsson in Arjeplog in 1691 are also sources.

During the 17th century, the Swedish government commissioned a work to gain more knowledge of the Sámi and their culture. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) rumours were spread that the Swedes won their battles with the help of Sámi witchcraft. Such rumours were part of the background for the research that lead to Johannes Schefferus&#x27; book &quot;Lapponia&quot;, published in Latin in 1673. For Schefferus, a number of &quot;priests&#x27; correspondences&quot; (&quot;prästrelationer&quot;) were written by vicars within the Sámi districts of Sweden. Treatises by Samuel Rheen, Olaus Graan, Johannes Tornæus and Nicolai Lundius were the sources used by Schefferus. In Norway, the main source are writings from the mission of Thomas von Westen and his colleagues from 1715 until 1735. Authors were Hans Skanke, Jens Kildal, Isaac Olsen, and Johan Randulf (the &quot;Nærøy manuscript&quot;). These books were, in part, instructions for the missionaries and their co-workers, and part documentation, intended for the government in Copenhagen. Late books within this tradition are Pehr Högström&#x27;s &quot;Beskrifning Öfwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker&quot; (1747) in Sweden and Knud Leem&#x27;s &quot;Beskrivelse over Finmarkens Lapper&quot; (1767) in Denmark-Norway. Notable is especially Læstadius&#x27; &quot;Fragments of Lappish Mythology&quot; (1839–45), which both discusses earlier treatises with a critical approach, and builds upon Læstadius&#x27; own experience.

== The shape of the drums ==

=== Wood ===
The drums are always oval; the exact shape of the oval would vary with the kind of wood used. Drums which still exist are of four different types, and can be divided into two main groups: bowl drums and frame drums.
# In bowl drums, the wood consists of a burl shaped into a bowl. The burl usually comes from pine, but sometimes from spruce. The membrane is attached to the wood with a sinew. 
# Frame drums are shaped by wet or heat bending; the wood is usually pine, and the membrane is sewn to holes in the frame with sinew. 
# Ring drums are made from a naturally grown piece of pine wood. There is only one known drum of this type. 
# Angular-cut frame drums are made from one piece of wood cut from a tree. To bend the wood into an oval, angular cuts are made in the bottom and the side of the frame. Only two such drums are preserved, both from Kemi Sámi districts in Finland. The partly preserved drum from Bjørsvik in Nordland is also an angular-cut frame drum.

In his major work on Sámi drums, &quot;Die lappische Zaubertrommel&quot;, Ernst Manker lists 41 frame drums, one ring drum, two angular-cut frame drums and 27 bowl drums. Given these numbers, many tend to divide the drums into two main groups: bowl drums and frame drums, seeing the others as variations. Judged by these remaining drums and their known provenance, frame drums seem to be more common in the Southern Sámi areas, and bowl drums seem to be common in the Northern Sámi areas. The bowl drum is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic drum type, this being the frame drum. The frame drum type is more reminiscent of other ceremonial drums used by the indigenous peoples of Siberia.

=== The membrane and its symbols ===

The membrane is made of untanned reindeer hide. Lars Olsen, who described his uncle&#x27;s drum, the Bindal drum, in 1885, said that the hide was usually taken from the neck of a reindeer calf because of its thickness. The symbols were painted with a paste made from alder bark.

The motifs on a drum reflect the worldview of the owner and his family, both in terms of religious beliefs and in their modes of subsistence. A world is depicted via images of reindeer, both domesticated and wild, and of carnivorous predators that pose a threat to the herd. The modes of subsistence are presented by scenes of wild game hunting, boats with fishing nets, and reindeer herding. Additional imagery on the drum consists of mountains, lakes, people, deities, as well as the camp-site with tents and storage-houses. Symbols of foreign civilizations, such as churches and houses, represent the threats from the surrounding and expanding non-Sámi community. Each owner chose his set of symbols; there are no two drums with identical sets of symbols. The drum mentioned in the medieval Latin tome &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot;, with motifs such as whales, reindeer, skis and a boat would have belonged to a coastal Sámi. The Lule Sámi drum reflects an owner who found his mode of subsistence chiefly through hunting, rather than herding.

A typology based on the structure of the patterns can be divided into three main categories:
# Southern Sámi, characterized by the rhombus-shaped sun cross in the center
# Central Sámi, where the membrane is divided in two by a horizontal line, often with a solar symbol in the lower section
# Northern Sámi, where the membrane is divided by horizontal lines into three or five separate levels representing different worlds: the heavens, the world of the living and an underworld.

In Manker&#x27;s overview of 71 known drums, there are 42 Southern Sámi drums, 22 Central Sámi drums and seven Northern Sámi drums.

The Bindal drum is a typical Southern Sámi drum, with the sun-symbol in its center. Its last owner also explained that the symbols on the membrane were organized according to the four cardinal directions around the sun. South is described as the &quot;summer side&quot; or &quot;the direction of life,&quot; and contains symbols of the Sámi&#x27;s life in the fells during summer: the &quot;goahti&quot;, the storehouse or &quot;njalla&quot;, the herd of reindeer, and their pastures. North is described as &quot;the side of death,&quot; and contains symbols of sickness, death and wickedness.

Kjellström and Rydving have summarised the symbols of the drums in the following categories: nature, reindeer, bears, elk, other mammals (wolf, beaver, small fur animals), birds, fish, hunting, fishing, reindeer-herding, the camp site – with goahti, njalla and other storehouses, the non-Sámi village – often represented by the church, people, travel (skiing, reindeer with pulk, boats), and deities and their worlds. Sometimes even the use of the drum itself is depicted.

The reindeer-herding is mainly depicted with a circular symbol for the reindeer corral that was used to gather, mark and milk the flock. This symbol is found on 75% of the Southern Sámi drums, but not on any northern or eastern drums. The symbol for the corral is always placed in the lower half of the drum. Reindeer are represented as singular line figures, as fully modeled figures or by their antlers. The campsite is usually shown as a triangle symbolizing the tent/goahti. The Sámi storehouse (&quot;njalla&quot;) is depicted on many drums from different areas. The &quot;njalla&quot; is a small hut in bear cache style, built on top of a cut tree. It is usually depicted with its ladder in front.

Sámi deities are shown on several drum membranes. These are the high god &quot;Ráðði&quot;, the demiurge and sustainer &quot;Varaldi olmmai&quot;, the thunder and fertility god &quot;Horagallis&quot;, the weather god &quot;Bieggolmmái&quot;, the hunting god &quot;Leaibolmmái&quot;, the sun god &quot;Beaivi&quot; / &quot;Biejjie&quot;, the mother goddesses &quot;Máttaráhkká&quot;, &quot;Sáráhkká&quot;, &quot;Juoksáhkká&quot; og &quot;Uksáhkká&quot;, the riding &quot;Ruto&quot; spirit who brought sickness and death, and &quot;Jábmeáhkká&quot; – the empress of the underworld.

Some subjects from the non-Sámi world also appears on several drums. These are interpreted as attempts to understand and master the new influences interacting with the Sámi society. Churches, houses and horses appear on several drums, and drums from Torne and Kemi districts show both the city, the church and the &quot;lapp commissary&quot;.

Interpretation of the drums&#x27; symbols might be difficult, and different explanations have been proposed for several of the symbols. It has often been assumed that the Sámi deliberately gave misleading explanations when they presented their drums to missionaries and other Christian audiences, in order to downplay the pagan elements and emphasise the Christian impact on Sámi culture. However, it has also been proposed that some of the symbols have been over-interpreted as religious motifs, when they actually represented matters of everyday life.

Håkan Rydving evaluated the drum symbols from a perspective of source criticism, and divides them into four categories:
# Preserved drums that were explained by their owners. These are only two such drums: Anders Paulsen&#x27;s drum and the Freavnantjahke gievrie.
# Preserved drums that were explained by other people, contemporary to the owners. These are five such drums, four Southern Sami and one Ume Sami. 
# Lost drums that were explained by contemporaries, either the owner or other people. There are four of these drums.
# Preserved drums without a contemporary explanation. These make up the majority of the 70 known drums.

Rydving and Kjellström have demonstrated that both Olov Graan&#x27;s drum fra Lycksele and the Freavnantjahke gievrie have been &quot;spiritualized&quot; through Manker&#x27;s interpretations: When the explanations are compared, it appears as if Graan relates the symbols to household life and modes of subsistence, where Manker sees deities and spirits. This underlines the problems of interpretation. Symbols that Graan explains as snowy weather, a ship, rain and squirrels in the trees, are interpreted by Manker as the wind god Bieggolmai/Biegkålmaj, a boat sacrifice, a weather god and – among other suggestions – as a forest spirit. At the Freavnantjahke gievrie there is a symbol explained by the owner as &quot;a Sámi riding in his pulk behind his reindeer&quot;, while Manker suggests that &quot;this might be an ordinary sleigh ride, but we might as well assume that this is the &quot;noaidi&quot;, the drum owner, going on an important errand into the spiritual world&quot;. On the other hand, one might suggest that the owner of the Freavnantjahke gievrie, Bendik Andersen, is de-emphasising the spiritual content of the drum when the symbols usually recognized as the three mother goddesses are explained away by him as &quot;men guarding the reindeer&quot;.

=== Tools ===

The primary tools used when working with the drum are mainly the drum hammer and one or two &quot;vuorbi&quot; for each drum. The drums also had different kinds of cords as well as &quot;bear nails&quot;.

The drum hammer (Northern Sami: &quot;bállin&quot;) was usually made of horn and was T- or Y-shaped, with two symmetric heads, and with geometric decorations. Some hammers have tails made of leather straps, or have leather or tin wires wrapped around the shaft. Manker (1938) knew and described 38 drum hammers. The drum hammer was used for both trance drumming and, together with the &quot;vuorbi&quot;, for divination.

The &quot;vuorbi&quot; (&#x27;index&#x27; or &#x27;pointer&#x27;; Northern Sámi &quot;vuorbi&quot;, &quot;bajá&quot; or &quot;árpa&quot;; Southern Sámi &quot;viejhkie&quot;) used for divination was made of brass, horn or bone, and sometimes of wood.

The cords are leather straps nailed or tied to the frame, or to the bottom of the drum. They had pieces of bone or metal tied to them. The owner of the Freavnantjahke gievrie, Bendix Andersen Frøyningsfjell, explained to Thomas von Westen in 1723 that the leather straps and their decorations of tin, bone and brass were offers of gratitude to the drum, given by the owner as a response to good luck gained via the messages the shaman received when using the drum. The frame of the Freavnantjahke gievrie also had 11 tin nails in it, in a cross shape. Bendix explained them as an indicator of the number of bears killed thanks to instructions given by the drum. Manker found similar bear nails in 13 drums. Other drums had a baculum from a bear or a fox among the cords.

== Using the drum ==


Ernst Manker summarized the use of the drum, regarding both trance and divination:
* before use, the membrane was tightened by holding the drum close to the fire 
* the user stood on his knees, or sat with his legs crossed, holding the drum in his left hand
* the vuorbi was placed on the membrane, either in a fixed starting place or one chosen at random
* the hammer was held in the right hand; the membrane was struck either with one of the hammer heads, or with the flat side of the hammer
* the drumming started at a slow pace, and grew wilder
* if the drummer fell into a trance, his drum was placed upon him, with the painted membrane facing downwards
* the route of the vuorbi across the membrane, and the places where it stopped, were interpreted as significant

Samuel Rheen, who was a priest in Kvikkjokk 1664–1671, was one of the first to write about Sámi religion. His impression was that many Sámi, but not all, used the drum for divination. Rheen mentioned four kinds of things the drum could give:
# knowledge about what was happening elsewhere
# knowledge about luck, misfortune, health, and illness
# curing diseases
# advice on which deity one should sacrifice unto

Of these four things mentioned by Rheen, other sources state that the first of them was only performed by the &quot;noaidi&quot;. Based on the sources, one might get the impression that the use of the drum was gradually &quot;democratized&quot;, so that there in some regions there was a drum in each household, and that the father of the household could use it to seek advice. Yet the original use of the drum, inducing trance work, seems to have remained a specialty of the shaman.

Sources seem to agree that in Southern Sámi districts in the 18th century, each household had its own drum. These were mostly used for divination. The types and the configurations of the motifs on the Southern Sámi drums suggest it was, indeed, used for divination. On the other hand, the configurations of the Northern Sámi drum motifs, with their hierarchical structures of the worlds, represent a mythological universe in which it was the noaidi&#x27;s privilege to wander.

The drum was usually carried along on nomadic wanderings. There are also reports of drums being hidden close to regular campsites. Inside the lavvu and the goahti, the drum was always placed in the &quot;boaššu&quot;, the space behind the fireplace that was considered the &quot;holy room&quot; of the goahti.

Several contemporary sources describe a dual view of the drums: they were seen both as occult devices and as divination tools for practical purposes. Drums were inherited. Not all of those who owned drums in the 18th century described themselves as active users of their drum--at least that was what they insisted when the drums were confiscated.

There is no known evidence of the drum or the &quot;noaidi&quot; having had any role in childbirth or funeral rituals.

Some sources suggest that the drum was manufactured with the aid of secret rituals. However, Manker made a photo documentary describing the drum-making process. The selection of the motifs for the membrane, or the philosophy behind it, are not described in any sources. It is known that the dedication of a new drum featured rituals that involved the whole household.

=== In trance ===
The &quot;noaidi&quot; used the drum to induce a state of trance. He hit the drum with an intense rhythm until he went into a trance or sleep-like state. While in this state, his free spirit could travel into the spirit-worlds, or to other places in the material world. The episode mentioned in &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot; tells about a &quot;noaidi&quot; who traveled to the spirit-world and fought against enemy spirits in order to heal the sick. The writings of Peder Claussøn Friis (1545–1614) describe a Sámi in Bergen who could supposedly travel in the material world while he was in a trance: a Sámi named Jakob made his spirit-journey to Germany to learn about the health of a German merchant&#x27;s family.

Both Nicolai Lundius (ca 1670), Isaac Olsen (1717) and Jens Kildal (ca. 1730) describe noaidis traveling to spirit-worlds where they negotiated with death deities, especially &quot;Jábmeáhkka&quot;--the queen of the realm of the dead--regarding people&#x27;s health and lives. This journey involved risks to the noaidi&#x27;s own life and health.

=== Divination and luck ===
In the writings of both Samuel Rheen and Isaac Olsen, the drum is mentioned as a part of the preparations for a bear hunt. Rheen says that the noaidi could give information about hunting fortune, while Olsen suggests that the noaidi was able to manipulate the bear to move into the hunters&#x27; range. The noaidi--or the drum&#x27;s owner--was a member of the group of hunters, following on the heels of the spear bearer. The noaidi also sat at a prominent place during the feast after the hunting.

In &quot;Fragments of Lappish Mythology&quot; (1840–45), Lars Levi Læstadius writes that the Sámi used his drum as an oracle, and consulted it when some important matter was at hand. &quot;Just like any other kind of fortune-telling with cards or dowsing. One should not consider every drum owner a magician.&quot; A common practice was to let the &quot;vuorbi&quot; move across the membrane, visiting the different symbols. The noaidi would interpret the will of the gods by the route taken by the vuorbi. Such practices are described in conjunction with the Bindal drum, the Freavnantjahke gievrie and the Velfjord drum.

=== Women ===
Whether women were allowed to use the drum has been debated, but no consensus has yet been reached. On one hand, some sources say that women were not even allowed to touch the drum, and during herd migration, women should follow another route than the sleigh that carried the drum. On the other, the whole family was involved in the initiation of the drum. Also, the participation of joiking women was of importance for a successful spirit-journey.

May-Lisbeth Myrhaug has reinterpreted the sources from the 17th and 18th century, and suggests that there is evidence of female noaidi, including spirit-travelling female noaidi.

In contrast to the claim that only men could be &quot;noaidi&quot; and use the drum, there are examples of Sami women who did use the drum. Kirsten Klemitsdotter (d. 1714), Rijkuo-Maja of Arvidsjaur (1661-1757) and Anna Greta Matsdotter of Vapsten, known as Silbo-gåmmoe or Gammel-Silba (1794-1870), are examples of women noted to have used the drum.

== Drums after Christianisation ==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, several raids were made to confiscate drums, both in Sweden and in Denmark-Norway, during the Christianization of the Sámi people. Thomas von Westen and his colleagues considered the drums to be &quot;the Bible of the Sámi&quot;, and wanted to eradicate what they saw as &quot;idolatry&quot; by destroying or removing the drums. Any uncontrolled, &quot;idol-worshipping&quot; Sámi were considered a threat to the government. The increased missionary efforts towards the Sámi in the early 18th century might be explained as a consequence of the government&#x27;s desire to controle the citizens under the era of absolute monarchy in Denmark-Norway, and also as a consequence of the increased emphasis on an individual Christian faith in pietism, popular at the time.

In Åsele, Sweden, 2 drums were collected in 1686, 8 drums in 1689 and 26 drums in 1725, mainly of the Southern Sámi type. Thomas von Westen collected about a hundred drums from the Southern Sámi district; 8 of them were collected at Snåsa in 1723. 70 of von Westen&#x27;s drums were lost in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. von Westen found few drums during his journeys in the Northern Sámi districts between 1715 and 1730. This might be explained by the advanced Christianisation of the Sámi in the north, in that the drums had already been destroyed. It might also be explained through the differences in the ways the drums were used in Northern and Southern Sámi cultures, respectively. While the drum was a common household item in Southern Sámi culture, it might have been a rare object, reserved for the few educated &quot;noaidi&quot; in Northern Sámi culture.

Probably the best-known is the Linné Drum – a drum that was given to Carl Linnaeus during his visits to northern Sweden. He later gave it to a museum in France, and it was later brought back to the Swedish National Museum. Three Sámi drums can be found in the collections of the British Museum, including one bequeathed by Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the museum. Over 30 drums are held at the Nordiska Museet, Stockholm; with others held in Rome, Berlin, Leipzig and Hamburg. Cambridge University’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and London&#x27;s Horniman Museum all hold examples of Sami drums.

Anders Poulsen&#x27;s drum became part of the Danish Royal Collection after his trial and death. It eventually entered the collections of the National Museum of Denmark and was on loan to the Sámi Museum in Karasjok, northern Norway, from 1979. Following &quot;a 40-year struggle&quot; it was officially returned to the Sámi people in 2022, according to Jelena Porsanger, director of the museum, following an appeal by Norway&#x27;s Sámi president to Queen Margrethe of Denmark.

<text>Kenneth Edward Olin (born July 30, 1954) is an American actor, television director, and producer. As an actor, Olin is known for his role as Michael Steadman in the ABC drama series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; (1987–1991), for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama nomination in 1990. Olin later began working behind the scenes, as a director and producer. His credits as a producer include &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006), &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2006–2011), and &quot;This Is Us&quot; (2016–2022). Olin is married to actress Patricia Wettig.

==Career==
===Acting===
Olin made several guest appearances on episodic primetime TV in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His first series regular role was on the short-lived NBC comedy-drama &quot;Bay City Blues&quot; in 1983. He later joined the cast of NBC police drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; playing Detective Harry Garibaldi from 1984 to 1985, and from 1985 to 1986 co-starred on the CBS prime time soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as Father Christopher Rossini. Olin also guest-starred on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Hotel&quot; before he was cast as Michael Steadman, one of the lead roles in the ABC drama series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. Debuting in 1987, the series received critical acclaim, setting a new bar for realism in the realm of prime-time drama. For his performance, Olin was nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1990.

In 1996, Olin played a leading role in the short-lived CBS crime drama &quot;EZ Streets&quot;. From 1998 to 1999, he played the leading role in another short-lived CBS series, medical drama &quot;L.A. Doctors&quot;. He appeared along with wife Patricia Wettig in the 1995 television film &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot;, and well as in &quot;Telling Secrets&quot; (1993) with Cybill Shepherd, &quot;The Advocate&#x27;s Devil&quot; (1997) alongside Mariska Hargitay, and &quot;Evolution&#x27;s Child&quot; (1999). His film credits include roles in &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1981), &quot;Queens Logic&quot; (1991), and &quot;&#x27;Til There Was You&quot; (1997).

From 2007 to 2011, Olin had a recurring role opposite wife Patricia Wettig in the ABC drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, he had a recurring role in the CBS drama series, &quot;Zoo&quot;. In 2020, ABC ordered a sequel for &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; and Olin was set to return alongside Mel Harris, Timothy Busfield and Patricia Wettig; however, the project remains in development limbo. 

===Producing and directing===
Olin directed six episodes of &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. He also directed television movies &quot;The Broken Cord&quot; (1992), &quot;Doing Time on Maple Drive&quot; (1992), &quot;In Pursuit of Honor&quot; (1995) and &quot;Phenomenon II&quot; (2003), as well as &quot;White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf&quot; (1994) for Buena Vista Pictures. He directed episodes of &quot;L.A. Doctors&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, 23 episodes of &quot;Alias&quot;, 20 episodes of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and 20 episodes of &quot;This Is Us&quot;.

Olin has been an executive producer on several television dramas, starting with the ABC action drama &quot;Alias&quot; (2001-2006). From 2006 to 2011, he was a producer on ABC&#x27;s family drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, and also appeared on a recurring basis. His wife, Patricia Wettig, was also a regular cast member on the show. In the summer of 1990, Olin directed Wettig in a production of &quot;My Mother Said I Never Should&quot; at the Powerhouse Theatre at Vassar College.

His other credits include &quot;Breaking News&quot; (2002), &quot;The Mob Doctor&quot; (2012-2013) and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. In 2016, he began producing NBC&#x27;s family drama &quot;This Is Us&quot;, which received four Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series nominations during its run.

==Personal life==
Olin was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a former Peace Corps official and pharmaceutical company owner. He was raised in Highland Park, Illinois. He graduated from The Putney School in Putney, Vermont, in 1972. He then matriculated into the 1976 class at the University of Pennsylvania. He is married to &quot;thirtysomething&quot; co-star, Patricia Wettig, with whom he has a son, Clifford, and a daughter, Roxanne, who appeared on &quot;The City&quot;.

<text>Sir Thomas Finney (5 April 1922 – 14 February 2014) was an English international footballer who played from 1946 to 1960 as a winger or centre forward for Preston North End and England. He is widely acknowledged to have been one of England&#x27;s greatest ever players. He was noted for his loyalty to Preston, for whom he made 433 Football League and 39 FA Cup appearances, scoring a total of 210 goals. He played for England 76 times, scoring 30 goals.

==Early life==
Finney was born on 5 April 1922 at his parents&#x27; home on St Michael&#x27;s Road, Preston, Lancashire, a few hundred yards from Deepdale stadium, the home of Preston North End. His parents were Maggie (&quot;née&quot; Mitchell) and Alf Finney. He had an elder brother called Joe and four sisters called Madge, Peggy, Doris and Edith. Alf was a clerical worker in local government who sometimes found himself unemployed on account of the changing economic climate. When Tom was very young, the family moved to Daisy Lane in the Holme Slack area of Preston. They were struck by tragedy in 1927 when Maggie was suddenly taken ill and died, aged 32. Alf managed to keep the family together with the help of relations and neighbours.

Inspired by his father, who was a keen football fan, Finney played the game from a very early age both at school and in the fields near home. His ambition was always to become a professional footballer but he was somewhat frail and sickly in his youth and stood only when he left school in 1936 at the age of fourteen. He became an apprentice for a local plumbing company called Pilkington&#x27;s.

The following year, Finney saw an advert placed by Preston North End in the local newspaper for junior players aged fourteen to eighteen. He asked his father to help him get a trial. His father met Preston trainer Will Scott and it was arranged. Finney had an outstanding match in the trial and was immediately offered a contract at the wage of £2 10s a week. He went home to get his father&#x27;s approval but Alf Finney refused, insisting that he must first complete his apprenticeship before signing professional terms. Preston were nevertheless happy with this and Finney joined them as an amateur, doing his training in the evenings after work and eligible to play for the club&#x27;s junior teams.

Largely inspired by Bill Shankly, who was a first team regular, and helped by Scott, Finney worked hard in training and began to enhance his skills and technique. He later described Shankly as his &quot;football mentor&quot;. Finney soon won a place in Preston&#x27;s youth team, known as the B team, which won four trophies while he played for them. Although he was satisfied with plumbing as a full-time career, he set himself the goal of becoming a professional footballer and playing for the club&#x27;s first team.

==Second World War==
===Turning professional===
Finney was 17 when the Second World War began in September 1939. His elder brother Joe was playing for Netherfield A.F.C. and training with nearby Blackburn Rovers. Their father thought it would be sensible for both his sons to be at the same club. Finney had a trial for Netherfield at this time, but was rejected by the Kendal club. Almost 70 years later, Finney returned to the ground at Parkside Road, Kendal, as a guest of the club. The club&#x27;s then chairman apologised to Finney on the pitch in front of 500 fans, describing Netherfield&#x27;s decision as the &quot;biggest mistake in football history&quot;.

In January 1940, Finney was about to join Rovers when he received a letter from North End which resulted in him signing on as a professional. He later recalled that he was signed on wartime terms of ten shillings a match.

First-class league and cup football had been suspended for the duration, but regional wartime competitions were organised as a boost to the people&#x27;s morale. There were ten regional leagues in 1939–40 and Preston were in the North West League, finishing as runners-up to champions Bury. Finney continued to play youth team football through the season.

===1940–41 season===
The number of leagues were reduced to two in 1940 and Preston joined the North Regional League (NRL) for the 1940–41 season, which began on Saturday, 31 August 1940. They began their campaign with an away match against Liverpool at Anfield. Finney, now 18, made his first team debut playing on the right wing (wearing the no. 7 shirt). Five of his youth team colleagues, including Andy McLaren, also made their first team debuts. Played before an estimated 6,000 people, the result was a 3–3 draw after Preston led 3–2 at half-time. The Liverpool team included Bob Paisley, Billy Liddell and, playing as a guest, Stan Cullis. For military reasons, neither Matt Busby of Liverpool nor Bill Shankly of Preston were available. The &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot; praised Finney&#x27;s performance as he was involved in creating two of the Preston goals and, but for a lucky save by Sam Bartram, would have scored the winning goal near the end of the match.

With Finney in the team, Preston went on to enjoy a successful season and won the NRL with 18 wins in the 29 matches they played. They also won the Football League War Cup, defeating Arsenal 2–1 in a replay at Ewood Park after the final at Wembley Stadium ended 1–1. There were 36 teams in the 1940–41 NRL – 34 in the South Regional League (SRL) – but, because of wartime demands limiting the availability of players and venues, fixtures were often unfulfilled. For example, Bury played the most matches (38) while their near neighbours Bolton Wanderers could only manage 16.

The War Cup began in February with ties played on a two-legged, home-and-away basis. Finney began with two goals at home against Bury, a match described as a thriller that ended 4–4. Preston won 2–1 in the second leg at Gigg Lane and then enjoyed convincing victories over Bolton Wanderers and Tranmere Rovers to reach the quarter-finals. They defeated Manchester City 5–1 on aggregate but faced a tough semi-final tie against Newcastle United. Preston won the first leg at home 2–0 and held on for a 0–0 draw in the second at St James&#x27; Park. In one of his rare appearances that season, Bill Shankly scored both goals in the home leg.

The final at Wembley was the biggest event of Finney&#x27;s career so far and he described the experience at some length in his autobiography. Playing on the right wing, he directly faced Eddie Hapgood, who was the England captain, and Finney said the prospect made him &quot;feel quite weak at the knees&quot;. Because of wartime travel constraints, only a few hundred Preston fans were in the 60,000 crowd but among them were Finney&#x27;s father and brother. Finney got the better of Hapgood to provide the assist for McLaren to score the opening goal. He says Preston should have made the most of their advantage but they failed to score from several good chances and Arsenal equalised with a goal by Denis Compton. The match ended 1–1 and Finney said the team were disappointed.

The Preston fans formed the majority of the crowd at the replay in Blackburn. Finney recalled that it was touch-and-go as to whether Bobby Beattie, their Scottish international inside forward would be able to play because of his RAF commitments. He had not arrived at Deepdale when the team set off for Blackburn and they were surprised to find him waiting at Ewood; he had gone straight there after getting a late release to play. It was as well for Preston he did because he scored both their goals as they defeated Arsenal 2–1; Bernard Joy scored an equaliser for Arsenal after Beattie&#x27;s first. Finney gave most of the credit to Beattie but both of the goals came from moves in which he was primarily involved. Finney recalled that, for winning the War Cup, each of the Preston players were awarded five wartime savings certificates with a value of fifteen shillings apiece. Having faced Finney twice, the experienced Hapgood said he was &quot;amazed to see a right-winger dribbling so brilliantly with his left foot&quot;.

===1942–43 season===
In December 1942, Finney made a guest appearance for Southampton in a 3–1 defeat by Arsenal at The Dell.

===Service in Egypt and Italy===
Aged 20, Finney was called up in April 1942 and assigned as a trooper to the Royal Armoured Corps.

He was sent to Egypt and served with Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army. When on leave in North Africa, he was able to play for army football teams against local opposition. Many years later, he met the Egyptian film actor Omar Sharif, who told him that as a teenager he had been a substitute for one of the teams Finney played against, but he did not take part in the match.

In April 1945, Finney took part in the final offensive at the Battle of the Argenta Gap as a Stuart tank driver with the 9th Lancers.

==First-class playing career==
===Preston North End===
====League debut====
League football resumed on Saturday 31 August 1946. Preston were in the First Division and began the new season with a home match against Leeds United. Playing on the right wing, Finney made his debut in a team that included Bill Shankly and Andy Beattie. The crowd was over 25,000 and, on what Finney called &quot;a carnival sort of afternoon&quot;, Preston won 3–2. Finney said he was &quot;lucky enough to score one of the goals&quot; and his biographer Paul Agnew cites this as a typical example of Finney&#x27;s modesty. Newspapers of the day reported that Preston&#x27;s win was a &quot;one-man show&quot;; that Finney created all their goals; that Leeds would have won but for Finney; and that Finney&#x27;s goal, Preston&#x27;s second, was &quot;a brilliant solo effort&quot;. Although this match was his league debut, he was by no means a newcomer to the team, and the local supporters knew from his wartime appearances that Finney was an outstanding prospect. It was not until he played league football that his genius as a player was fully recognised.

Finney went on to play for Preston in fourteen English league seasons from 1946–47 to 1959–60, including twelve in the First Division. He played in the Second Division for two seasons after Preston were relegated at the end of the 1948–49 season. In the Second Division, Preston finished sixth in 1949–50 and then won the division championship in 1950–51. The club was thereby promoted back to the First Division where they remained for ten years until the end of the 1960–61 season, the one following Finney&#x27;s retirement. Preston&#x27;s best league position during Finney&#x27;s career was second in both the 1952–53 and 1957–58 seasons.

====Second income====
Post-war demand for plumbers ensured that Finney had a second income to supplement the £14 he received as a footballer. He became known as &quot;The Preston Plumber&quot; and ran his own successful plumbing business from the 1940s until the 1990s.

====Palermo approach====
Along with Stanley Matthews, Finney was English football&#x27;s most famous player in the decade after the war. In 1952, Preston&#x27;s chairman Nat Buck rejected an offer for Finney worth £10,000 over two years from Italian club Palermo, and Finney remained a one-club player.

====1950s====
In the 1952–53 season, Preston were runners-up to Arsenal in the First Division. Preston won their last three games and this run took them two points clear of Arsenal at the top of the league table, but Arsenal still had a game in hand. This match, at home to Burnley, was the Championship decider and was played on the night before the 1953 FA Cup Final. Arsenal had to win to equal Preston&#x27;s points total and overtake them on goal average. They won 3–2 and claimed the title by the margin of 0.099 of a goal. It was the closest that Finney came to a major title in his career.

He played for Preston in the 1954 FA Cup Final against West Bromwich Albion, his only cup final appearance. Preston lost 3–2 and Finney revealed in his autobiography that he was not fully match fit and &quot;did not give his best performance&quot;.

Finney formed an attacking partnership with Tommy Thompson in the 1950s. In the 1956–57 season they scored a combined total of 57 goals; in 1957–58 their combined tally was 60 goals. Preston were First Division runners-up again in 1957–58, five points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers.

===England===
Finney made his international debut for England on 28 September 1946, only four weeks after his Football League debut. The match was at Windsor Park against Ireland in the Home Championship. Finney scored once in England&#x27;s 7–2 victory. He later said the match was his &quot;proudest day as a footballer&quot;.

Finney won 76 caps and scored 30 goals in an England career that spanned twelve years and included 51 victories. He scored his 29th international goal in June 1958 against the Soviet Union to become joint England all-time top-scorer, sharing the record with Vivian Woodward and Nat Lofthouse. In October the same year, he netted his 30th goal, against Northern Ireland, to become the sole holder of the record. Finney made his final appearance for England on 22 October 1958, in a 5–0 win over the Soviet Union at Wembley. In the same match, Lofthouse equalled Finney&#x27;s tally of 30 goals for England. Both were surpassed by Bobby Charlton on 12 October 1963.

===Style and technique===
Finney was a versatile attacking player who could operate in any forward position on either side of the pitch or at centre-forward. In the 1950s, he was often compared with Stanley Matthews and football fans would debate who was the best player, given Matthews&#x27; dribbling skills and Finney&#x27;s all round ability. Relatively small in stature, Finney could withstand hard tackling but his movement, speed and ball control invariably enabled him to avoid contact with defenders. While Finney was himself a frequent goal scorer, he was also a creator of goals and it was because of his assists that he was considered &quot;the ideal team man&quot;.

Finney was voted Footballer of the Year in 1953–54. He won the award again in 1956–57, becoming the first player to win it a second time.

Finney respected the rules of football and believed in fair play and sportsmanship. He was never booked or sent off in his career. Both on and off the field, he always had a reputation as a gentleman. Dave Whelan supported this view when he said of Finney: &quot;He was and still is a total gentleman&quot;.

==Retirement from Preston North End==
Finney retired from competitive football in 1960 because of a persistent groin injury. He had played his entire career for his local club, making 433 League appearances and scoring 187 goals. At the end of the 1960–61 season, the first after Finney&#x27;s retirement, Preston were relegated from the First Division and have not returned to the top flight since.

Finney continued playing football after he left Preston, often appearing in charity and benefit matches. In 1962, he played in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City, appearing in one match and recorded a goal. In 1963, he played for Northern Irish club Distillery against Benfica in the European Cup.

==Later years==

Finney continued to run his plumbing business in Preston and he also worked for local charities and hospitals. On 9 November 1988, he was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Finney was led to believe he was attending a sports function in central London, and was then surprised by the host Michael Aspel and many of Finney&#x27;s former teammates. In 2007, he was awarded an honorary fellowship by Myerscough College in Preston. Celebrating Finney&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2012, Tommy Docherty said &quot;To me, Messi is Finney reborn&quot;.
On 31 July 2004, Finney unveiled the water feature sculpture &quot;The Splash&quot;, by sculptor Peter Hodgkinson, outside Deepdale stadium which at that time housed The National Football Museum. The sculpture was inspired by the 1956 Sports Photograph of the Year which shows Finney beating two Chelsea defenders at a waterlogged Stamford Bridge, which was taken on 25 August 1956 by photographer John Horton. The museum has been moved to Manchester but the statue remains at Deepdale.

Finney maintained his links with Preston North End as the club&#x27;s president and 2006 marked 60 years since his League debut for the club. To celebrate this diamond anniversary, the National Football Museum, an organisation which he championed and with which he had close links, invited football fans to sign a specially commissioned flag which was presented to Finney at the beginning of the 2006–07 season to mark his 60 years with Preston. He was also club president of non-league Kendal Town.

Finney was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1961 Birthday Honours after his retirement from competitive football. Later, in recognition of his charitable work, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1992 New Year Honours and then knighted in the 1998 New Year Honours.

==Personal life==
Finney was married to Elsie (&quot;née&quot; Noblett) from 1945 until her death in 2004. They had two children: a son Brian (born 1947) and a daughter Barbara (born 1950). In her later years, Lady Finney suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which led Finney as her full-time carer to be a strong supporter of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society. Two Preston care homes, Finney House and Lady Elsie Finney House, are named after Tom and Elsie.

==Death and legacy==
Finney died in Preston on 14 February 2014. The cause of death was not announced. At the time of his death aged 91, he was one of England&#x27;s oldest living former international footballers.

Finney was highly regarded by his former teammate Bill Shankly, who described Finney as &quot;the greatest player I ever saw, bar none&quot;. On another occasion, Shankly said that Finney was &quot;a ghost of a player but very strong. He could have played all day in his overcoat&quot;. Stanley Matthews once ranked him alongside Pelé, Diego Maradona, George Best and Alfredo Di Stéfano as one of the few players who could &quot;dictate the pace and course of a game on a regular basis&quot;.

In a tribute to Finney, The Football Association said he was &quot;one of England&#x27;s all-time greatest players&quot; and Bobby Charlton said Finney&#x27;s contributions to football were &quot;immeasurable&quot;. In April 2014, Northern Premier League club Bamber Bridge announced their Irongate Ground would be renamed the Sir Tom Finney Stadium.

Ahead of the 2021–22 EFL Championship season, the EFL agreed that the West Lancashire derby between Preston North End and Blackpool would take place at Deepdale on the evening of 5 April 2022, to celebrate the centenary of Finney&#x27;s birth. Preston won 1–0 before a crowd of 18,740, nearly a full house.

<doc id="722976" wikidata="Q6541867" url="?curid=722976" title="Liberty Lobby">
<text>Liberty Lobby was a far-right think tank and lobby group founded in 1958 by Willis Carto. Carto was known for his promotion of antisemitic conspiracy theories, white nationalism, and Holocaust denial.

The organization produced a daily five-minute radio show called &quot;This is Liberty Lobby&quot;, which was broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System and other radio stations. At the conclusion of each show, listeners were invited to get a copy of its &quot;America First&quot; pamphlet.

== History ==
Liberty Lobby described itself as &quot;a pressure group for patriotism; the only lobby in Washington, D.C., registered with Congress which is wholly dedicated to the advancement of government policies based on our Constitution and conservative principles.&quot; According to Chip Berlet, Liberty Lobby presented itself as &quot;a patriotic populist organization seeking to restore constitutional safeguards and national sovereignty&quot; and said that it &quot;consistently [denied] that it [was] the least bit antisemitic, much less neofascist or quasinazi&quot;. 

Carto&#x27;s Noontide Press republished Francis Parker Yockey&#x27;s &quot;Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics&quot;, and also published a number of other books and pamphlets promoting a racialist and white supremacist world view, and Liberty Lobby in turn sold and promoted these books.

While Liberty Lobby was intended to occupy a niche as a conservative anti-Communist group, Carto was meanwhile forming other organizations which would take a much more explicit neo-Nazi orientation. Among these was the National Youth Alliance in 1968, that in early 1970s became the National Alliance. Eventually Carto lost control of this organization, which fell into the hands of William Luther Pierce. Carto founded the Institute for Historical Review by 1978, a group known for publishing Holocaust denial books and articles. As with the National Youth Alliance and Noontide Press, the Institute for Historical Review fell out of Carto&#x27;s hands in a hostile internal struggle. Liberty Lobby, however, remained under the control of Carto until it was disbanded in 2001.

During the 1968 United States presidential election Liberty Lobby distributed a pro-Wallace pamphlet entitled &quot;Stand up for America&quot; despite the campaign&#x27;s denial of such a connection. 

During the 1970s, as the anti-Communism of the 1950s and 1960s fell out of favor, Carto redefined the public image of Liberty Lobby, and began to describe it as a politically populist organization, rather than conservative or right-wing. Liberty Lobby also tried to create connections to the American political left by redistributing a report critical of President Jimmy Carter authored by frequent third-party presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche and his NCLC.

Liberty Lobby was infiltrated by journalist Robert Eringer, who wrote about the organization in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 1981. The organization campaigned against the ratification of the Genocide Convention.

=== &quot;The Spotlight&quot; ===

In 1975, Liberty Lobby began publishing a weekly newspaper called &quot;The Spotlight&quot;, which ran news and opinion articles with a very populist and anti-establishment slant on a variety of subjects, but gave little indication of being extreme-right or neo-Nazi. However, critics charged &quot;The Spotlight&quot; was intended as a subtle recruiting tool for the extreme right, using populist-sounding articles to attract people from all points on the political spectrum including liberals, moderates, and conservatives, and special-interest articles to attract people interested in such subjects as alternative medicine. Critics also charged the newspaper with subtly incorporating antisemitic and white racialist undertones in its articles, and with carrying advertisements in the classified section for openly neo-Nazi groups and books. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described The Spotlight as &quot;a newspaper containing orthodox conservative political articles interspersed with anti-Zionist tracts and classified advertisements...&quot;

&quot;The Spotlight&#x27;s&quot; circulation peaked around 200,000 in the early 1980s, and although it experienced a steady drop after that, it continued to be published until Liberty Lobby&#x27;s demise in 2001.

Liberty Lobby founded &quot;The Barnes Review&quot; in 1994.

=== Demise ===

In 2001, Liberty Lobby and Carto lost a civil lawsuit brought by a rival far-right group which had earlier gained control of the Institute for Historical Review, and the ensuing judgment for damages bankrupted the organization. Carto and others who had been involved in publishing &quot;The Spotlight&quot; have since started a new newspaper, the &quot;American Free Press&quot;, which is very similar in overall tone to &quot;The Spotlight&quot;. , the political organization called Liberty Lobby remains defunct.

== Views ==

===Antisemitism===
Liberty Lobby described itself as a conservative political organization.

Evidence for the antisemitic stance of Liberty Lobby began to mount when numerous letters by Carto excoriating the Jews (and blaming them for world miseries) began to surface, which included statements such as &quot;How could the West [have] been so blind. It was the Jews and their lies that blinded the West as to what Germany was doing. Hitler&#x27;s defeat was the defeat of Europe and America.&quot; Carto&#x27;s letters eventually became the subject of a federal civil lawsuit. There were several other defamation lawsuits arising from publications that described Liberty Lobby as anti-semitic or racist, but it appears that Liberty Lobby never won any of these cases.

Other evidence of the group&#x27;s antisemitic views includes the charge that the group&#x27;s file cabinets contained extensive pro-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan literature. In 1969, &quot;True&quot; magazine ran a story by Joe Trento, titled &quot;How Nazi Nut Power Has Invaded Capitol Hill&quot;.

=== “Repatriation” of black people ===

Beginning in October 1966 two American journalists, Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson, published a series of stories in their widely-syndicated &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; column which recounted the findings of a former employee, Jeremy Horne. Horne said he had discovered a box of correspondence between Carto and numerous government officials establishing the Joint Council of Repatriation (JCR), a forerunner organization to Liberty Lobby. The JCR stated that their fundamental purpose was to &quot;repatriate blacks back to Africa&quot;. Ex-Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Thomas Pickens Brady and various members of the White Citizens&#x27; Councils who had worked to establish the JCR contributed to the founding of Liberty Lobby. Other correspondence referred to U.S. Congressional support for the emerging Liberty Lobby, such as from South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond (Dixiecrat presidential candidate in 1948) and California U.S. Representative James B. Utt.

Pearson reported that Utt, as well as congressmen John M. Ashbrook, Ellis Yarnal Berry, W. Pat Jennings and William Jennings Bryan Dorn, received &quot;Statesman of the Republic&quot; awards from Liberty Lobby for their &quot;right-wing activities&quot;.

Liberty Lobby sued for libel based on the stories in a case decided in 1986 by the U.S. Supreme Court, &quot;Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.&quot; The case was the most quoted Supreme Court precedent in 1997 because it established the guidelines for issuing summary judgment to end frivolous lawsuits.

<text>Prof Ferdinand Zirkel FRS(For) HFRSE (20 May 183811 June 1912) was a German geologist and petrographer.

==Biography==
Zirkel was born in Bonn. Educated in his native town, he graduated PhD from the University of Bonn in 1861. His training and initial interest was in mining. In 1860 he traveled to Iceland with William Thierry Preyer, and in 1862 they published &quot;Reise nach Island im Sommer 1860&quot;.

After graduation, Zirkel was engaged in teaching geology and mineralogy in Vienna at the Geological Institution. His journey to Iceland, along with travels to the Faeroe Islands, Scotland and England, and a meeting with Henry Clifton Sorby, led him from mining to the study of microscopical petrography, then a comparatively new science.

He became professor of geology in 1863 in the University of Lemberg, in 1868 at the University of Kiel, and in 1870 was made professor of mineralogy and geology in the University of Leipzig. He traveled for study in France, Italy, and Scotland; came to the United States in 1874 to examine the great collections of minerals made during the exploration of the fortieth degree of latitude; and in 1894-95 pursued scientific investigations in Ceylon and India.

He retired in 1909. He was an honorary D.Sc. of Oxford University, and also a foreign member of the Royal Society and an honorary member of the Mineralogical Society.

==Publications==
His numerous papers and essays include &quot;Geologische Skizze van der Westküste Schottlands&quot; (1871); &quot;Die Struktur der Variolite&quot; (1875); &quot;Microscopical Petrography&quot; (in Report of U.S. Geol. Exploration of 40th Par., vol. vi., 1876); &quot;Limurit aus der Vallée de Lesponne&quot; (1879); &quot;Über den Zirkon&quot; (1880). His separate works include &quot;Lehrbuch der Petrographie&quot; (1866; 2nd ed. 1893, 1894); &quot;Die mikroskopische Beschaffenheit der Mineralien und Gesteine&quot; (1873); and &quot;Über Urausscheidungen rheinischer Basalte&quot; (1893).
==Recognition==
*Mount Zirkel in the Park Range of Colorado, USA, is named after him.
*The mineral zirkelite is named after him.
*Dorsum Zirkel on the Moon is named after him.

<text>Fort Sheridan is a residential neighborhood within the cities of Lake Forest, Highwood, and Highland Park in Lake County, Illinois, United States. It was originally established as Fort Sheridan, an Army post named after Civil War cavalry general Philip Sheridan, to honor his services to Chicago.

==Early history==
A French trading post was established &quot;circa&quot; 1670 on a trail between Green Bay, Wisconsin, and the early Chicago area. The trail and trading post was used by Native Americans and settlers alike. The settlers were mostly Irish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants. The area was never considered suitable for farming due to the many ravines and heavy forestation. In the 1840s a small community, St. Johns, was established. It was settled on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The villagers were active in logging, leather tanning, brick making, and iron casting. The area eventually became ravaged by rampant deforestation associated with the production of 400,000 bricks annually. The village grew idle and became mostly deserted by 1865. The Fort Sheridan cemetery, established in 1889, is still an ongoing military burial site owned by the federal government. Retired armed forces members may be buried there.

==Fort Sheridan closing==

The main fort was ordered closed as a result of the first round of closures initiated by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 1988, and was officially closed by the Department of Defense on May 3, 1993. The majority of the property was relinquished to the Fort Sheridan Joint Planning Committee as the redevelopment authority, which then sold large segments of the land and housing to commercial land developers. Most of the original housing structures were then refurbished and resold as a residential community.

Other buildings were given to cultural organizations like the Midwest Young Artists Conservatory, the largest youth music program in the Midwest. Approximately of the southern end of the original post were retained by the Army; there the Army now operates the Sheridan Reserve Center complex. This includes the Great Lakes Training Division, 84th Training Command (an Army Reserve Brigadier General command), as well as numerous Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel commands. Newly refurbished housing is part of the military enclave and is used for active duty and active guard/reserve personnel and families stationed at Fort Sheridan and Great Lakes Navy Training Center.

==Historic district==

In 1984 parts of Fort Sheridan were designated a National Historic Landmark District by the National Park Service. The National Park Service states that the site &quot;possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America.&quot; The historic district includes of land and buildings bounded by Hutchinson and Bartlett Ravines and the shore of Lake Michigan. There are 94 buildings in the district. The buildings include officers&#x27; quarters, barracks, stables, a drill hall, water tower, and many other institutional buildings. The parade ground was preserved as open space.

==Forest preserve==

A forest preserve, operated by Lake County Forest Preserves, now sits on of the former fort. The preserve had been working since the 1980s on acquiring land from the U.S. Army. In 1997, the Army began conveyance of the northern section of the former base. The third and final section was obtained in 2001.

The preserve has roughly of trail for hiking, of trail for cross-country skiing, and of trail for bicycling. The preserve includes roughly of shoreline. Throughout the preserve are educational exhibits and viewing stations along the trails.

==Transportation==
The Fort Sheridan station provides Metra commuter rail service along the Union Pacific North Line. Trains travel south to Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago, and north to Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Pace provides bus service on Route 472 connecting Fort Sheridan to Highland Park and other destinations.

<doc id="722986" wikidata="Q6195080" url="?curid=722986" title="Jim Fregosi">
<text>James Louis &quot;Jim&quot; Fregosi (April 4, 1942 – February 14, 2014) was an American professional baseball shortstop and manager, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to , primarily for the Los Angeles / California Angels. He also played for the New York Mets, Texas Rangers, and Pittsburgh Pirates.

Having been the Angels’ most productive and popular player for that franchise&#x27;s first eleven years of play, Fregosi quickly became its first star. He led the American League (AL) in defensive double plays twice, winning the Gold Glove Award, and, upon leaving the team, ranked ninth in AL history, with 818 double plays. Fregosi holds the franchise record with 70 career triples; several of his other team records, including career games (1,429), hits (1,408), doubles (219), runs (691), and runs batted in (546), were broken by Brian Downing over the course of the through seasons.

Fregosi returned to the team as manager, guiding it to its first-ever postseason appearance in , and later managed the Philadelphia Phillies to the 1993 National League pennant.

==Early life==
James Louis &quot;Jim&quot; Fregosi was born on April 4, 1942, in San Francisco, California, and spent part of his youth growing up in nearby in San Mateo. He was the son of Archie and Margaret Fregosi and also spent time growing up in South San Francisco. His paternal grandparents were Italian, while his maternal grandparents were English and Irish.

A right-handed batter, Fregosi is one of many notable alumni of Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, where he excelled in football, basketball, and baseball, and also ran track. Other graduates include Tom Brady, Barry Bonds, and Lynn Swann. He graduated in 1959, and was inducted to the school&#x27;s inaugural Athletic Hall of Fame class in 1990.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Fregosi was signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Red Sox in . The Red Sox assigned him to the Alpine (Texas) Cowboys of the Sophomore League, where he played shortstop and second base, with a .267 batting average in 1960. In December of the same year, after the Red Sox chose not to protect him, he was selected by the Angels in the 1960 MLB Expansion Draft.

The Angels assigned him to the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers of the Triple-A American Association in 1961, where he hit .254, playing solely at shortstop. He was called up by the Angels in September 1961 and played in 11 games. In 1962, he played in 64 games for Dallas-Fort Worth, his final games in the minor leagues, and joined the Angels after hitting .283 in 219 at bats.

===Los Angeles / California Angels (1961–1971)===
On September 14, , Fregosi made his Major League debut. After hitting .291 in 175 at-bats as a reserve in 1962 and starting 49 games at shortstop, he batted .287 – ninth in the AL – in his first full season in 1963. He was second in the league in triples and fifth in hits. He made his first All-Star squad in 1964, batting .277. Fregosi was the leadoff hitter for the American League all-star team, and had one hit in four at bats.

From 1964 to mid-May 1969, he teamed with second baseman Bobby Knoop (Knoop was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1969 after 27 games) to form one of the game&#x27;s top double-play combinations. With Knoop winning Gold Gloves from 1966 to 1968, the two became only the third middle infield combination (after Nellie Fox and Louis Aparicio in 1959 and 1960) to win the honor in the same season (1967). On July 28, , Fregosi became the first Angel to hit for the cycle when he did so against the Yankees, and he did so again on May 20, , but this one was an unnatural cycle, hitting a home run in the first inning, a triple in the third inning, a double in the eighth inning, and a game-winning walk-off single in the bottom of the 11th inning.

Fregosi continued to turn out solid years, particularly in 1967, when he batted .290 (seventh in the AL) and won his only Gold Glove, finishing seventh in the MVP voting. He became regarded as the league&#x27;s top-hitting shortstop, and best all-around shortstop, leading the AL in triples (13) in 1968. He was named an All-Star every season from 1966 to 1970. But he was sidelined in when a tumor was discovered in his foot, playing in only 107 games after playing between 147 and 161 games from 1963 to 1970. Fregosi&#x27;s future with the Angels became uncertain when the Angels acquired Jose Cardenas on November 30, 1971, and named him their starting shortstop.

In 1969, the fans voted him the number one player in franchise history and, in 1998, the team retired his number 11. He was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame in 1989. On August 12, 2014, in a game between the Angels and Phillies, both teams wore patches honoring Fregosi.

===New York Mets (1972–1973)===

On December 10, 1971, Fregosi was traded to the New York Mets for four players, including future hall of fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, a trade that embittered many New York fans because of Ryan&#x27;s future success. Fregosi took jibes over the trade with good humor, saying the blame belonged with Angels&#x27; general manager Harry Dalton, not him. (Fregosi would later manage Ryan in 1978 and 1979, Ryan&#x27;s last two years as an Angel.)

Sidelined by several injuries, including a broken thumb, in , Fregosi struggled with the Mets, where he played mainly at third base (85 games to only six at shortstop). He played in only 101 games, with a .232 batting average and five home runs.

===Texas Rangers (1973–1977)===
Fregosi was sold to the Texas Rangers in the middle of the season. He spent five years as a backup for the Rangers (1973–77), during which he played primarily as a first baseman.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1977–1978)===
Fregosi was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in June 1977 for Ed Kirkpatrick, who had been Fregosi&#x27;s Angels teammate from 1962 to 1968. When the Angels expressed interest in naming him as their manager in , the Pirates released him to pursue the opportunity. He took the Angels&#x27; managerial job the day after he was released.

=== Career ===
In his 18-year career, Fregosi batted .265 with 1,726 hits, 151 home runs, 844 runs, 706 RBI, 264 doubles, 78 triples, and 76 stolen bases in 1,902 games played. Brian Downing broke his club marks for career at bats (5,244), total bases (2,112) and extra base hits (404). As of 2024, Fregosi ranks sixth, sixth, and seventh, respectively, in those categories for the Angels. Don Baylor broke his team record of 115 home runs in at a time when Fregosi was Baylor&#x27;s manager. As of 2024, neither is in the all-time top 10 home run leaders for the Angels.

Fregosi was the last player to retire who was a member of the &quot;original&quot; Los Angeles Angels.

National Sportscasters and Sportwriters Hall of Fame inductee Frank Deford said of Fregosi in 1964: &quot;If Jim Fregosi played for the Los Angeles Dodgers instead of the Los Angeles Angels, the city would cast his footprint or his gloveprint or something in cement outside of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. He ... would be endorsing everything under the smog. For Jim Fregosi, just 22 years old, is generally acknowledged as the best young player in the American League.&quot;

==Managerial career==

===California Angels (1978–1981)===

In becoming the Angels&#x27; manager at age 36, Fregosi was presented with a solid team nucleus of Ryan, Baylor, Downing, Bobby Grich, Carney Lansford, Frank Tanana, and longtime owner Gene Autry, compiling a record of 62–54 in 117 games, and tying for second with Texas behind the Kansas City Royals. In 1979, with the addition of Rod Carew, he led the Angels to an 88–74 record, surprising the Royals and winning the first title in the club&#x27;s 19-year existence. But they did not have enough to get by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1979 American League Championship Series. The Angels lost Game 1 in 10 innings and dropped a 9–8 slugfest in Game 2. The Angels captured a 4–3 win in Game 3, scoring twice in the bottom of the ninth on an error and a Larry Harlow double, but were knocked out in an 8–0 Game 4 loss.

After Ryan&#x27;s departure to the Houston Astros at the end of the season, the team&#x27;s pitching faltered in (going from three starters with ERAs of 3.89 or lower in 1979, to no starter below 4.06 in 1980), and the club dropped back into sixth place in their division. Fregosi was replaced in the first half of the season. Fregosi&#x27;s record was 237 wins and 248 losses in the regular season and one win and three losses in the postseason.

===Louisville Redbirds===
From the Angels, Fregosi was brought back into the game by Cardinals Farm Director Lee Thomas (Fregosi&#x27;s Angels teammate 1961-64) to manage the Louisville Redbirds of the American Association for three seasons. Louisville finished first during the regular season in Fregosi&#x27;s first season in 1983, and lost the league championship in the playoffs. In Fregosi&#x27;s second season, Louisville tied for fourth place in the regular season but won the 1984 league championship. In 1985, Fregosi&#x27;s Louisville team finished the season in first place and won the league championship in the playoffs.

===Chicago White Sox (1986–1988)===
With his success in Louisville, Fregosi was hired to manage the Chicago White Sox in . Fregosi managed the team for three seasons, in each of which the White Sox finished in fifth place in the American League West. Fregosi was released at the end of the season. He finished with a record of 193 wins and 226 losses in the regular season. He did not manage any postseason games for the White Sox.

===Philadelphia Phillies (1991–1996)===
Fregosi returned in with the Phillies, hired again by former Angels teammate and General Manager Lee Thomas. His greatest triumph as a manager came in , when he managed the club to the World Series. After finishing 26 games out of first place in , in last place, the 1993 Phillies (featuring a cast of colorful characters, including Darren Daulton, Lenny Dykstra, Dave Hollins, John Kruk, Danny Jackson, Curt Schilling, and Mitch Williams) charged to 97 wins. The Phillies then further shocked the baseball world by pulling off a major upset against the two-time defending NL Champion Atlanta Braves in six games in the League Championship Series. Despite putting up a good fight against the defending World Champion Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series, Fregosi&#x27;s Phillies wound up losing to Toronto in six games, with Joe Carter&#x27;s Series-winning home run in Game 6 being the final blow. Fregosi&#x27;s fit as a manager for this unusual group of players was important in their unexpected success.

Despite the World Series run, Fregosi was often the target of criticism by the Philadelphia sports media. One general criticism of Fregosi was that he was a manager who relied on veteran players and was unable to develop younger players. He ultimately was fired by the Phillies in after posting a series of dismal post-1993 seasons. Fregosi finished with a record of 431 wins and 463 losses in the regular season and six wins and six losses in the postseason.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1999–2000)===
After leaving the Phillies, Fregosi was a scout and became a special assistant to San Francisco Giants&#x27; general manager Brian Sabean for two years. He was hired away from the Giants to become manager of the Blue Jays in , one month before the season began. He replaced Tim Johnson, who was fired after one year due to lying about his military service in Viet Nam and play in college football.

The team finished in third place and above .500 in each of Fregosi&#x27;s two seasons in Toronto. On July 27, 2000, he won his 1,000th game as manager, doing so against the Seattle Mariners 7–2. Despite fair results, he was let go after the season. Fregosi finished with a record of 167 wins and 157 losses in the regular season. This ended up being his final managerial position in Major League Baseball. His run with the Blue Jays was the only stint where he finished with an overall winning record.

===Post-managerial career===
As a manager, he had a record of 1028 wins and 1094 losses in 15 seasons. He also managed 16 post-season games, finishing with a record of seven wins and nine losses. At the end of , when the Phillies were looking for a manager to replace Larry Bowa, Fregosi surfaced as a candidate for the job. The job ended up going to Charlie Manuel.

Fregosi&#x27;s number 11 was retired by the Angels in . Fregosi delivered a eulogy at the March 2007 funeral of longtime friend and former Phillies coach John Vukovich.

At the time of his death, Fregosi had been the top advance scout for the Atlanta Braves for 13 years. He had joined the Braves after leaving Toronto, and worked as a special assistant to Atlanta Braves general managers John Schuerholz and then Frank Wren, and was the number one confidant to each of them.

For his scouting work, in 2011, Fregosi received the George Genovese Lifetime Achievement Award, from the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation.

===Managerial record===

==Personal life==
Fregosi was known for not wanting to discuss his personal life in the baseball context. He always joked that had he written any autobiography, it would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;The Bases Were Loaded And So Was I.&quot;

===Death===
On February 8, 2014, Fregosi suffered a series of strokes on an MLB alumni cruise. The cruise docked in the Cayman Islands where he was rushed to a local hospital, and his condition was stabilized by doctors before he was relocated to Miami. On February 13, Fregosi&#x27;s condition declined and he died early on February 14, at the age of 71. Phillies owner David Montgomery memorialized Fregosi as a &quot;dear friend&quot;.

Shortly after his death, on March 5, 2014, the Braves and Phillies held a 12-minute ceremony honoring Fregosi before their preseason game.

His father was an attorney and his mother came from a powerful West Side political family. He joined WBBM in the mid-1980s, only to leave with friend Kathryn Pratt to start a TV writing career.

He and Kathryn Pratt married in 1992 and had two children. Their marriage was dissolved in 2002. Following the dissolution he married television writer Jennifer Levin. In 2003, his Thanksgiving Day production company created a show for ESPN, &quot;Playmakers&quot;. In 2008, he was signed to a deal with Universal Media Studios.

<text>Postmodern literature is a form of literature that is characterized by the use of metafiction, unreliable narration, self-reflexivity, intertextuality, and which often thematizes both historical and political issues. This style of experimental literature emerged strongly in the United States in the 1960s through the writings of authors such as Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Pynchon, William Gaddis, Philip K. Dick, Kathy Acker, and John Barth. Postmodernists often challenge authorities, which has been seen as a symptom of the fact that this style of literature first emerged in the context of political tendencies in the 1960s. This inspiration is, among other things, seen through how postmodern literature is highly self-reflexive about the political issues it speaks to.

Precursors to postmodern literature include Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605–1615), Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (1760–1767), James Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Private Memoires and Convessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; (1824), Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–1834), and Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957), but postmodern literature was particularly prominent in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 21st century, American literature still features a strong current of postmodern writing, like the postironic Dave Eggers&#x27; &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; (2000), and Jennifer Egan&#x27;s &quot;A Visit from the Goon Squad&quot; (2011). These works also further develop the postmodern form.

Sometimes the term &quot;postmodernism&quot; is used to discuss many different things ranging from architecture to historical theory to philosophy and film. Because of this fact, several people distinguish between several forms of postmodernism and thus suggest that there are three forms of postmodernism: (1) Postmodernity is understood as a historical period from the mid-1960s to the present, which is different from the (2) theoretical postmodernism, which encompasses the theories developed by thinkers such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and others. The third category is the &quot;cultural postmodernism&quot;, which includes film, literature, visual arts, etc. that feature postmodern elements. Postmodern literature is, in this sense, part of cultural postmodernism.

==Background==

===Notable influences===
Late 19th and early 20th century playwrights whose work influenced the aesthetics of postmodernism include August Strindberg, Luigi Pirandello, and Bertolt Brecht. Another precursor to postmodernism was Dadaism, which challenged the authority of the artist and highlighted elements of chance, whim, parody, and irony. Tristan Tzara claimed in &quot;How to Make a Dadaist Poem&quot; that to create a Dadaist poem one had only to put random words in a hat and pull them out one by one. Another way Dadaism influenced postmodern literature was in the development of collage, specifically collages using elements from advertisement or illustrations from popular novels (the collages of Max Ernst, for example). Artists associated with Surrealism, which developed from Dadaism, continued experimentations with chance and parody while celebrating the flow of the subconscious mind. André Breton, the founder of Surrealism, suggested that automatism and the description of dreams should play a greater role in the creation of literature. He used automatism to create his novel &quot;Nadja&quot; and used photographs to replace description as a parody of the overly-descriptive novelists he often criticized. Surrealist René Magritte&#x27;s experiments with signification are used as examples by Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Foucault also uses examples from Jorge Luis Borges, an important direct influence on many postmodernist fiction writers. He is occasionally listed as a postmodernist, although he started writing in the 1920s. The influence of his experiments with metafiction and magic realism was not fully realized in the Anglo-American world until the postmodern period. Ultimately, this is seen as the highest stratification of criticism among scholars.

Other early 20th-century novels such as Raymond Roussel&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1910) and &quot;Locus Solus&quot; (1914), and Giorgio de Chirico&#x27;s &quot;Hebdomeros&quot; (1929) have also been identified as important &quot;postmodern precursor[s]&quot;.

===Comparisons with modernist literature===
Postmodern literature represents a break from the 19th century realism. In character development, both modern and postmodern literature explore subjectivism, turning from external reality to examine inner states of consciousness, in many cases drawing on modernist examples in the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; styles of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, or explorative poems like &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot. In addition, both modern and postmodern literature explore fragmentariness in narrative- and character-construction. &quot;The Waste Land&quot; is often cited as a means of distinguishing modern and postmodern literature. The poem is fragmentary and employs pastiche like much postmodern literature, but the speaker in &quot;The Waste Land&quot; says, &quot;these fragments I have shored against my ruins&quot;. Modernist literature sees fragmentation and extreme subjectivity as an existential crisis, or Freudian internal conflict, a problem that must be solved, and the artist is often cited as the one to solve it. Postmodernists, however, often demonstrate that this chaos is insurmountable; the artist is impotent, and the only recourse against &quot;ruin&quot; is to play within the chaos. Playfulness is present in many modernist works (Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; or Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, for example) and they may seem very similar to postmodern works, but with postmodernism playfulness becomes central and the actual achievement of order and meaning becomes unlikely. Gertrude Stein&#x27;s playful experiment with metafiction and genre in &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; (1933) has been interpreted as postmodern.

===Shift to postmodernism===
As with all stylistic eras, no definite dates exist for the rise and fall of postmodernism&#x27;s popularity. 1941, the year in which Irish novelist James Joyce and English novelist Virginia Woolf both died, is sometimes used as a rough boundary for postmodernism&#x27;s start. Irish novelist Flann O&#x27;Brien completed &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; in 1939. It was rejected for publication and remained supposedly lost until published posthumously in 1967. A revised version called &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; was published before the original in 1964, two years before O&#x27;Brien died. Notwithstanding its dilatory appearance, the literary theorist Keith Hopper regards &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; as one of the first of that genre they call the postmodern novel.

The prefix &quot;post&quot;, however, does not necessarily imply a new era. Rather, it could also indicate a reaction against modernism in the wake of the Second World War (with its disrespect for human rights, just confirmed in the Geneva Convention, through the rape of Nanjing, the Bataan Death March, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Holocaust, the bombing of Dresden, the Katyn massacre, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and Japanese American internment). It could also imply a reaction to significant post-war events: the beginning of the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, postcolonialism (Postcolonial literature), and the rise of the personal computer (Cyberpunk and Hypertext fiction).

Some further argue that the beginning of postmodern literature could be marked by significant publications or literary events. For example, some mark the beginning of postmodernism with the first publication of John Hawkes&#x27; &quot;The Cannibal&quot; in 1949, the first performance of &quot;En attendant Godot&quot; in 1953 (&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, 1955), the first publication of &quot;Howl&quot; in 1956 or of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in 1959. For others the beginning is marked by moments in critical theory: Jacques Derrida&#x27;s &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play&quot; lecture in 1966 or as late as Ihab Hassan&#x27;s usage in &quot;The Dismemberment of Orpheus&quot; in 1971. Brian McHale details his main thesis on this shift, although many postmodern works have developed out of modernism, modernism is characterised by an epistemological dominant while postmodern works are primarily concerned with questions of ontology.

===Post-war developments and transition figures===
Though postmodernist literature does not include everything written in the postmodern period, several post-war developments in literature (such as the Theatre of the Absurd, the Beat Generation, and magic realism) have significant similarities. These developments are occasionally collectively labeled &quot;postmodern&quot;; more commonly, some key figures (Samuel Beckett, William S. Burroughs, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar and Gabriel García Márquez) are cited as significant contributors to the postmodern aesthetic.

The work of Alfred Jarry, the Surrealists, Antonin Artaud, Luigi Pirandello and so on also influenced the work of playwrights from the Theatre of the Absurd. The term &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; was coined by Martin Esslin to describe a tendency in theatre in the 1950s; he related it to Albert Camus&#x27;s concept of the absurd. The plays of the Theatre of the Absurd parallel postmodern fiction in many ways. For example, &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; by Eugène Ionesco is essentially a series of clichés taken from a language textbook. One of the most important figures to be categorized as both Absurdist and Postmodern is Samuel Beckett. The work of Beckett is often seen as marking the shift from modernism to postmodernism in literature. He had close ties with modernism because of his friendship with James Joyce; however, his work helped shape the development of literature away from modernism. Joyce, one of the exemplars of modernism, celebrated the possibility of language; Beckett had a revelation in 1945 that, in order to escape the shadow of Joyce, he must focus on the poverty of language and man as a failure. His later work, likewise, featured characters stuck in inescapable situations attempting impotently to communicate whose only recourse is to play, to make the best of what they have. As Hans-Peter Wagner says:
The &quot;Beat Generation&quot; was the youth of America during the materialistic 1950s; Jack Kerouac, who coined the term, developed ideas of automatism into what he called &quot;spontaneous prose&quot; to create a maximalistic, multi-novel epic called the Duluoz Legend in the mold of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. More broadly, &quot;Beat Generation&quot; often includes several groups of post-war American writers from the Black Mountain poets, the New York School, the San Francisco Renaissance, and so on. These writers have occasionally also been referred to as the &quot;Postmoderns&quot; (see especially references by Charles Olson and the Grove anthologies edited by Donald Allen). Though this is now a less common usage of &quot;postmodern&quot;, references to these writers as &quot;postmodernists&quot; still appear and many writers associated with this group (John Ashbery, Richard Brautigan, Gilbert Sorrentino, and so on) appear often on lists of postmodern writers. One writer associated with the Beat Generation who appears most often on lists of postmodern writers is William S. Burroughs. Burroughs published &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in Paris in 1959 and in America in 1961; this is considered by some the first truly postmodern novel because it is fragmentary, with no central narrative arc; it employs pastiche to fold in elements from popular genres such as detective fiction and science fiction; it&#x27;s full of parody, paradox, and playfulness; and, according to some accounts, friends Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg edited the book guided by chance. He is also noted, along with Brion Gysin, for the creation of the &quot;cut-up&quot; technique, a technique (similar to Tzara&#x27;s &quot;Dadaist Poem&quot;) in which words and phrases are cut from a newspaper or other publication and rearranged to form a new message. This is the technique he used to create novels such as &quot;Nova Express&quot; and &quot;The Ticket That Exploded&quot;.

Magic realism is a style popular among Latin American writers (and can also be considered its own genre) in which supernatural elements are treated as mundane (a famous example being the practical-minded and ultimately dismissive treatment of an apparently angelic figure in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot;). Though the technique has its roots in traditional storytelling, it was a center piece of the Latin American &quot;boom&quot;, a movement coterminous with postmodernism. Some of the major figures of the &quot;Boom&quot; and practitioners of Magic Realism (Gabriel García Márquez, Julio Cortázar etc.) are sometimes listed as postmodernists. This labeling, however, is not without its problems. In Spanish-speaking Latin America, &quot;modernismo&quot; and &quot;posmodernismo&quot; refer to early 20th-century literary movements that have no direct relationship to &quot;modernism&quot; and &quot;postmodernism&quot; in English. Finding it anachronistic, Octavio Paz has argued that postmodernism is an imported grand récit that is incompatible with the cultural production of Latin America.

Along with Beckett and Borges, a commonly cited transitional figure is Vladimir Nabokov; like Beckett and Borges, Nabokov started publishing before the beginning of postmodernity (1926 in Russian, 1941 in English). Though his most famous novel, &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955), could be considered a modernist or a postmodernist novel, his later work (specifically &quot;Pale Fire&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle&quot; in 1969) are more clearly postmodern.

===Scope===

Some of the earliest examples of postmodern literature are from the 1950s: William Gaddis&#x27; &quot;The Recognitions&quot; (1955), Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955), and William Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1959). It then rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s with the publication of Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; in 1961, John Barth&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; in 1968, Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; in 1969, and many others. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is &quot;often considered as postmodern novel, redefining both postmodernism and the novel in general.&quot;

The 1980s, however, also saw several key works of postmodern literature. Don DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;White Noise&quot;, Paul Auster&#x27;s &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; and this is also the era when literary critics wrote some of the classic works of literary history, charting American postmodern literature: works by Brian McHale, Linda Hutcheon, and Paul Maltby who argues that it was not until the 1980s that the term &quot;postmodern&quot; caught on as the label for this style of writing.

A new generation of writers—such as David Foster Wallace, William T. Vollmann, Dave Eggers, Michael Chabon, Zadie Smith, Chuck Palahniuk, Jennifer Egan, Neil Gaiman, Carole Maso, Richard Powers, Jonathan Lethem—and publications such as &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot;, and the fiction pages of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, herald either a new chapter of postmodernism or possibly post-postmodernism. Many of these authors emphasize a strong urge for sincerity in literature.

==Common themes and techniques==
Several themes and techniques are indicative of writing in the postmodern era. These themes and techniques are often used together. For example, metafiction and pastiche are often used for irony. These are not used by all postmodernists, nor is this an exclusive list of features.

=== Irony, playfulness, black humor===
Linda Hutcheon claimed postmodern fiction as a whole could be characterized by the ironic quote marks, that much of it can be taken as tongue-in-cheek. This irony, along with black humor and the general concept of &quot;play&quot; (related to Derrida&#x27;s concept or the ideas advocated by Roland Barthes in &quot;The Pleasure of the Text&quot;) are among the most recognizable aspects of postmodernism. Though the idea of employing these in literature did not start with the postmodernists (the modernists were often playful and ironic), they became central features in many postmodern works. In fact, several novelists later to be labeled postmodern were first collectively labeled black humorists: John Barth, Joseph Heller, William Gaddis, Kurt Vonnegut, Bruce Jay Friedman, etc. It is common for postmodernists to treat serious subjects in a playful and humorous way: for example, the way Heller and Vonnegut address the events of World War II. The central concept of Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the irony of the now-idiomatic &quot;catch-22&quot;, and the narrative is structured around a long series of similar ironies. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; in particular provides prime examples of playfulness, often including silly wordplay, within a serious context. For example, it contains characters named Mike Fallopian and Stanley Koteks and a radio station called KCUF, while the novel as a whole has a serious subject and a complex structure.

===Intertextuality===
Since postmodernism represents a decentred concept of the universe in which individual works are not isolated creations, much of the focus in the study of postmodern literature is on intertextuality: the relationship between one text (a novel for example) and another or one text within the interwoven fabric of literary history. Intertextuality in postmodern literature can be a reference or parallel to another literary work, an extended discussion of a work, or the adoption of a style. In postmodern literature this commonly manifests as references to fairy tales—as in works by Margaret Atwood, Donald Barthelme, and many others—or in references to popular genres such as sci-fi and detective fiction. Often intertextuality is more complicated than a single reference to another text. Robert Coover&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio in Venice&quot;, for example, links Pinocchio to Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. Also, Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; takes on the form of a detective novel and makes references to authors such as Aristotle, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Borges. An early 20th century example of intertextuality which influenced later postmodernists is &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges, a story with significant references to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; which is also a good example of intertextuality with its references to Medieval romances. &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is a common reference with postmodernists, for example Kathy Acker&#x27;s novel &quot;Don Quixote: Which Was a Dream&quot;. References to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; can also be found in Paul Auster&#x27;s post-modern detective story, &quot;City of Glass&quot;. Another example of intertextuality in postmodernism is John Barth&#x27;s &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; which deals with Ebenezer Cooke&#x27;s poem of the same name.

===Pastiche===
Related to postmodern intertextuality, pastiche means to combine, or &quot;paste&quot; together, multiple elements. In Postmodernist literature this can be a homage to or a parody of past styles. It can be seen as a representation of the chaotic, pluralistic, or information-drenched aspects of postmodern society. It can be a combination of multiple genres to create a unique narrative or to comment on situations in postmodernity: for example, William S. Burroughs uses science fiction, detective fiction, westerns; Margaret Atwood uses science fiction and fairy tales; Umberto Eco uses detective fiction, fairy tales, and science fiction, and so on. Though commonly involves the mixing of genres, many other elements are also included (metafiction and temporal distortion are common in the broader pastiche of the postmodern novel). In Robert Coover&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Public Burning&quot;, Coover mixes historically inaccurate accounts of Richard Nixon interacting with historical figures and fictional characters such as Uncle Sam and Betty Crocker. Pastiche can instead involve a compositional technique, for example the cut-up technique employed by Burroughs. Another example is B. S. Johnson&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;The Unfortunates&quot;; it was released in a box with no binding so that readers could assemble it however they chose.

===Metafiction===
Metafiction is essentially writing about writing or &quot;foregrounding the apparatus&quot;, as is typical of deconstructionist approaches, making the artificiality of art or the fictionality of fiction apparent to the reader and generally disregards the necessity for &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;. For example, postmodern sensibility and metafiction dictate that works of parody should parody the idea of parody itself.

Metafiction is often employed to undermine the authority of the author, for unexpected narrative shifts, to advance a story in a unique way, for emotional distance, or to comment on the act of storytelling. For example, Italo Calvino&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; is about a reader attempting to read a novel of the same name. Kurt Vonnegut also commonly used this technique: the first chapter of his 1969 novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is about the process of writing the novel and calls attention to his own presence throughout the novel. Though much of the novel has to do with Vonnegut&#x27;s own experiences during the firebombing of Dresden, Vonnegut continually points out the artificiality of the central narrative arc which contains obviously fictional elements such as aliens and time travel. Similarly, Tim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 1990 short story cycle &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;, about one platoon&#x27;s experiences during the Vietnam War, features a character named Tim O&#x27;Brien; though O&#x27;Brien was a Vietnam veteran, the book is a work of fiction and O&#x27;Brien calls into question the fictionality of the characters and incidents throughout the book. One story in the book, &quot;How to Tell a True War Story&quot;, questions the nature of telling stories. Factual retellings of war stories, the narrator says, would be unbelievable, and heroic, moral war stories don&#x27;t capture the truth. David Foster Wallace in &quot;The Pale King&quot; writes that the copyright page claims it is fiction only for legal purposes, and that everything within the novel is non-fiction. He employs a character in the novel named David Foster Wallace. Giannina Braschi also has a namesake character and uses metafiction and pastiche in her novels &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; and &quot;United States of Banana&quot; about the collapse of the American empire.
===Fabulation===
Fabulation is a term sometimes used interchangeably with metafiction and relates to pastiche and Magic Realism. It is a rejection of realism which embraces the notion that literature is a created work and not bound by notions of mimesis and verisimilitude. Thus, fabulation challenges some traditional notions of literature—the traditional structure of a novel or role of the narrator, for example—and integrates other traditional notions of storytelling, including fantastical elements, such as magic and myth, or elements from popular genres such as science fiction. By some accounts, the term was coined by Robert Scholes in his book &quot;The Fabulators&quot;. Strong examples of fabulation in contemporary literature are found in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot;.

===Poioumena===
Poioumenon (plural: poioumena; from , &quot;product&quot;) is a term coined by Alastair Fowler to refer to a specific type of metafiction in which the story is about the process of creation. According to Fowler, &quot;the poioumenon is calculated to offer opportunities to explore the boundaries of fiction and reality—the limits of narrative truth.&quot; In many cases, the book will be about the process of creating the book or includes a central metaphor for this process. Common examples of this are Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, and Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, which is about the narrator&#x27;s frustrated attempt to tell his own story. A significant postmodern example is Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962), in which the narrator, Kinbote, claims he is writing an analysis of John Shade&#x27;s long poem &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, but the narrative of the relationship between Shade and Kinbote is presented in what is ostensibly the footnotes to the poem. Similarly, the self-conscious narrator in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; parallels the creation of his book to the creation of chutney and the creation of independent India. &quot;Anagrams&quot; (1970), by David R. Slavitt, describes a week in the life of a poet and his creation of a poem which, by the last couple of pages, proves remarkably prophetic. In &quot;The Comforters&quot;, Muriel Spark&#x27;s protagonist hears the sound of a typewriter and voices that later may transform into the novel itself. Jan Křesadlo purports to be merely the translator of a &quot;chrononaut&#x27;s&quot; handed down Homeric Greek science fiction epic, the &quot;Astronautilia&quot;. Other postmodern examples of poioumena include Samuel Beckett&#x27;s trilogy (&quot;Molloy&quot;, &quot;Malone Dies&quot; and &quot;The Unnamable&quot;); Doris Lessing&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot;; John Fowles&#x27;s &quot;Mantissa&quot;; William Golding&#x27;s &quot;The Paper Men&quot;; Gilbert Sorrentino&#x27;s &quot;Mulligan Stew&quot;; and S. D. Chrostowska&#x27;s &quot;Permission&quot;.

===Historiographic metafiction===
Linda Hutcheon coined the term &quot;historiographic metafiction&quot; to refer to works that fictionalize actual historical events or figures; notable examples include &quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot; by Gabriel García Márquez (about Simón Bolívar), &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot; by Julian Barnes (about Gustave Flaubert), &quot;Ragtime&quot; by E. L. Doctorow (which features such historical figures as Harry Houdini, Henry Ford, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Booker T. Washington, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung), and Rabih Alameddine&#x27;s &quot;&quot; which makes references to the Lebanese Civil War and various real life political figures. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot; also employs this concept; for example, a scene featuring George Washington smoking marijuana is included. John Fowles deals similarly with the Victorian period in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; has been said to feature a metafictional, &quot;Janus-headed&quot; outlook in the way the novel seeks to represent both from World War II while, at the same time, the very notion of doing exactly that.

===Temporal distortion===
Temporal distortion is a common technique in modernist fiction: fragmentation and nonlinear narratives are central features in both modern and postmodern literature. Temporal distortion in postmodern fiction is used in a variety of ways, often for the sake of irony. Historiographic metafiction is an example of this. Distortions in time are central features in many of Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s nonlinear novels, the most famous of which is perhaps Billy Pilgrim in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; becoming &quot;unstuck in time&quot;. In &quot;Flight to Canada&quot;, Ishmael Reed deals playfully with anachronisms, Abraham Lincoln using a telephone for example. Time may also overlap, repeat, or bifurcate into multiple possibilities. For example, in Robert Coover&#x27;s &quot;The Babysitter&quot; from &quot;Pricksongs &amp; Descants&quot;, the author presents multiple possible events occurring simultaneously—in one section the babysitter is murdered while in another section nothing happens and so on—yet no version of the story is favored as the correct version.

===Magic realism===
Magic realism may be literary work marked by the use of still, sharply defined, smoothly painted images of figures and objects depicted in a surrealistic manner. The themes and subjects are often imaginary, somewhat outlandish and fantastic and with a certain dream-like quality. Some of the characteristic features of this kind of fiction are the mingling and juxtaposition of the realistic and the fantastic or bizarre, skillful time shifts, convoluted and even labyrinthine narratives and plots, miscellaneous use of dreams, myths and fairy stories, expressionistic and even surrealistic description, arcane erudition, the element of surprise or abrupt shock, the horrific and the inexplicable. It has been applied, for instance, to the works of Massimo Bontempelli, author of Eva Ultima (1923), and of Jorge Luis Borges, author of &quot;Historia universal de la infamia&quot; (1935), considered a bridge between modernism and postmodernism in world literature. Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez is also regarded as a notable exponent of this kind of fiction—especially his novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. The Cuban Alejo Carpentier (&quot;The Kingdom of This World&quot;, 1949) is another described as a &quot;magic realist&quot;. Postmodernists such as Italo Calvino (&quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot;, 1957), and Salman Rushdie (&quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot;, 1999), commonly use magic realism in their work. A fusion of fabulism with magic realism is apparent in such early 21st-century American short stories as Kevin Brockmeier&#x27;s &quot;The Ceiling&quot;, Dan Chaon&#x27;s &quot;Big Me&quot;, Jacob M. Appel&#x27;s &quot;Exposure&quot;, and Elizabeth Graver&#x27;s &quot;The Mourning Door&quot;.

===Technoculture and hyperreality===
Fredric Jameson called postmodernism the &quot;cultural logic of late capitalism&quot;. &quot;Late capitalism&quot; implies that society has moved past the industrial age and into the information age. Likewise, Jean Baudrillard claimed postmodernity was defined by a shift into hyperreality in which simulations have replaced the real. In postmodernity people are inundated with information, technology has become a central focus in many lives, and one&#x27;s understanding of the real is mediated by simulations of the real. Many works of fiction have dealt with this aspect of postmodernity with characteristic irony and pastiche. For example, the virtual reality of &quot;empathy boxes&quot; in Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; in which a new technology-based religion called Mercerism arises. Another example is Don DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;White Noise&quot; presents characters who are bombarded with a &quot;white noise&quot; of television, product brand names, and clichés. The cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and many others use science fiction techniques to address this postmodern, hyperreal information bombardment.

===Paranoia===
Perhaps demonstrated most famously and effectively in Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;, the sense of paranoia, the belief that there&#x27;s an ordering system behind the chaos of the world is another recurring postmodern theme. For the postmodernist, no ordering is extremely dependent upon the subject, so paranoia often straddles the line between delusion and brilliant insight. Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, long-considered a prototype of postmodern literature, presents a situation which may be &quot;coincidence or conspiracy – or a cruel joke&quot;. This often coincides with the theme of technoculture and hyperreality. For example, in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut, the character Dwayne Hoover becomes violent when he&#x27;s convinced that everyone else in the world is a robot and he is the only human. This theme is likewise present in the satirical dystopian science-fiction tabletop role-playing game &quot;Paranoia&quot;.

===Maximalism and the &quot;Systems Novel&quot;===
Dubbed maximalism by some critics, and overlapping with the related term systems novel, the sprawling canvas and fragmented narrative of such writers as Dave Eggers and David Foster Wallace has generated controversy on the &quot;purpose&quot; of a novel as narrative and the standards by which it should be judged. The postmodern position is that the style of a novel must be appropriate to what it depicts and represents, and points back to such examples in previous ages as &quot;Gargantua&quot; by François Rabelais and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, which Nancy Felson hails as the exemplar of the polytropic audience and its engagement with a work.

In &quot;The Maximalist Novel: From Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow to Roberto Bolano&#x27;s 2666&quot;, (2014) Stefano Ercolino characterised maximalism as &quot;an aesthetically hybrid genre of the contemporary novel that develops in the second half of the twentieth century in the United States, then &#x27;emigrates&#x27; to Europe and Latin America at the threshold the twenty-first.&quot;. Ercolino singled out seven novels for particular attention: &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, &quot;White Teeth&quot;, &quot;The Corrections&quot;, &quot;2666&quot;, and &quot;2005 dopo Cristo&quot; by Babette Factory.

Tom LeClair had previously coined the term systems novel in his 1987 book &quot;In the Loop: Don DeLillo and the Systems Novel&quot;, exploring the concept further in his 1989 book, &quot;The Art of Excess: Mastery in Contemporary American Fiction&quot;. Having introduced the term in relation to Don DeLillo, Tom LeClair chose seven novels as the focus of &quot;The Art of Excess&quot;. They were: &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (by Thomas Pynchon), &quot;Something Happened&quot; (by Joseph Heller), &quot;J R&quot; (by William Gaddis), &quot;The Public Burning&quot; (by Robert Coover), &quot;Women and Men&quot; (by Joseph McElroy), &quot;LETTERS&quot; (by John Barth) and &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; (by Ursula Le Guin). LeClair&#x27;s systems novels were all &quot;long, large and dense&quot; and all in some way striving for &quot;mastery&quot;, showing similarity to &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; in &quot;range of reference, artistic sophistication, and desire for profound effect.&quot; LeClair wrote, &quot;These seven novels are about mastery, about excesses of power, force, and authority in arenas small and large: the self&#x27;s mastery of itself, economic and political hegemony, force in history and culture, the transforming power of science and technology, the control of information and art. These novels are also about the size and scale of contemporary experience: how multiplicity and magnitude create new relations and new proportions among persons and entities, how quantity affects quality, how massiveness is related to mastery.&quot;

Although Ercolino&#x27;s &quot;maximalist&quot; examples overlapped with LeClair&#x27;s earlier systems novel examples, Ercolino did not see &quot;mastery&quot; as a defining feature. According to Ercolino, &quot;it would make more sense to speak of an &quot;ambiguous&quot; relationship between maximalist narrative forms and power.&quot;

Many modernist critics, notably B.R. Myers in his polemic &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;, attack the maximalist novel as being disorganized, sterile and filled with language play for its own sake, empty of emotional commitment—and therefore empty of value as a novel. Yet there are counter-examples, such as Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; and David Foster Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; where postmodern narrative coexists with emotional commitment.

In a 2022 GQ article, &quot;Is the &#x27;systems novel&#x27; the future of fiction?&quot;, Sam Leith compared Tom McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Making of Incarnation&quot; with Dave Eggers&#x27; &quot;The Every&quot;. Leith wrote, &quot;The question ultimately posed, or pointed to, by systems novels is: can novels do without people? And the answer I would give is: not completely. The problem is, perhaps, that the part of our minds that responds to old-fashioned novels hasn&#x27;t changed as fast as the world around it.&quot;

===Minimalism===
Literary minimalism can be characterized as a focus on a surface description where readers are expected to take an active role in the creation of a story. The characters in minimalist stories and novels tend to be unexceptional. Generally, the short stories are &quot;slice of life&quot; stories. Minimalism, the opposite of maximalism, is a representation of only the most basic and necessary pieces, specific by economy with words. Minimalist authors hesitate to use adjectives, adverbs, or meaningless details. Instead of providing every minute detail, the author provides a general context and then allows the reader&#x27;s imagination to shape the story. Among those categorized as postmodernist, literary minimalism is most commonly associated with Jon Fosse and especially Samuel Beckett.

===Fragmentation===
Fragmentation is another important aspect of postmodern literature. Various elements, concerning plot, characters, themes, imagery and factual references are fragmented and dispersed throughout the entire work. In general, there is an interrupted sequence of events, character development and action which can at first glance look modern. Fragmentation purports, however, to depict a metaphysically unfounded, chaotic universe. It can occur in language, sentence structure or grammar. In &quot;Z213: Exit&quot;, a fictional diary by Greek writer Dimitris Lyacos, one of the major exponents of fragmentation in postmodern literature, an almost telegraphic style is adopted, devoid, in most part, of articles and conjunctions. The text is interspersed with lacunae and everyday language combines with poetry and biblical references leading up to syntax disruption and distortion of grammar. A sense of alienation of character and world is created by a language medium invented to form a kind of intermittent syntax structure which complements the illustration of the main character&#x27;s subconscious fears and paranoia in the course of his exploration of a seemingly chaotic world.

Patricia Lockwood&#x27;s 2021 Booker-shortlisted novel, No One Is Talking About This is a recent example of fragmentation, employing the technique to consider the effects of internet usage on quality of life and the creative process.

==Different perspectives==
John Barth, a postmodernist novelist who talks often about the label &quot;postmodern&quot;, wrote an influential essay in 1967 called &quot;The Literature of Exhaustion&quot; and in 1980 published &quot;The Literature of Replenishment&quot; in order to clarify the earlier essay. &quot;The Literature of Exhaustion&quot; was about the need for a new era in literature after modernism had exhausted itself. In &quot;The Literature of Replenishment&quot; Barth says:

Many of the well-known postmodern novels deal with World War II, one of the most famous of which being Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;. Heller claimed his novel and many of the other American novels of the time had more to do with the state of the country after the war:

In his &quot;Reflections on &#x27;The Name of the Rose″&quot;, the novelist and theorist Umberto Eco explains his idea of postmodernism as a kind of double-coding, and as a transhistorical phenomenon:

Novelist David Foster Wallace in his 1990 essay &quot;E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction&quot; makes the connection between the rise of postmodernism and the rise of television with its tendency toward self-reference and the ironic juxtaposition of what&#x27;s seen and what&#x27;s said. This, he claims, explains the preponderance of pop culture references in postmodern literature:

Hans-Peter Wagner offers this approach to defining postmodern literature:

<doc id="723000" wikidata="Q514654" url="?curid=723000" title="Gold standard (test)">
<text>In medicine and medical statistics, the gold standard, criterion standard, or reference standard is the diagnostic test or benchmark that is the best available under &quot;reasonable&quot; conditions. It is the test against which new tests are compared to gauge their validity, and it is used to evaluate the efficacy of treatments.

The meaning of &quot;gold standard&quot; may differ between practical medicine and the statistical ideal. With some medical conditions, only an autopsy can guarantee diagnostic certainty. In these cases, the gold standard test is the best test that keeps the patient alive, and even gold standard tests can require follow-up to confirm or refute the diagnosis.

==History==
The term &#x27;gold standard&#x27; in its current sense in medical research was coined by Rudd in 1979, in reference to the monetary gold standard.

==In medicine==

&quot;Gold standard&quot; can refer to popular clinical endpoints by which scientific evidence is evaluated. For example, in resuscitation research, the &quot;gold standard&quot; test of a medication or procedure is whether or not it leads to an increase in the number of neurologically intact survivors that walk out of the hospital. Other types of medical research might regard a significant decrease in 30-day mortality as the gold standard.

The AMA Style Guide has preferred the phrase &quot;criterion standard&quot; instead of &quot;gold standard.&quot; Other journals have also issued mandates in their instructions for contributors. For instance, the &quot;Archives of Biological Medicine and Rehabilitation&quot; specifies this usage. In practice, however, the uptake of this term by authors, as well as enforcement by editorial staff, is notably poor, at least for AMA journals.

When the criterion is a whole clinical testing procedure it is usually referred to as clinical case definition. Differing case definitions can produce wildly different results when used as the basis for evalulating a given diagnostic method.

== Application to diagnostic tests ==
A hypothetical ideal &quot;gold standard&quot; test has a sensitivity of 100% concerning the presence of the disease (it identifies all individuals with a well-defined disease process; it does not have any false-negative results) and a specificity of 100% (it does not falsely identify someone with a condition that does not have the condition; it does not have any false-positive results). In practice, there are no true gold standard tests. 

Sometimes a test becomes popular and is declared to be the gold standard without adequate consideration of alternatives or despite weaknesses.

As new diagnostic methods become available, the &quot;gold standard&quot; test may change over time. For instance, for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, the gold standard test used to be the aortogram, which had a sensitivity as low as 83% and a specificity as low as 87%. Since the advancements of magnetic resonance imaging, the magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) has become the new gold standard test for aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%. Before the widespread acceptance of any new test, the former test retains its status as the &quot;gold standard&quot;.

==Test calibration==

Because tests can be incorrect (yielding a false-negative or a false-positive), results should be interpreted in the context of the history, physical findings, and other test results of the individual being tested. It is within this context that the sensitivity and specificity of the &quot;gold standard&quot; test is determined.

When the gold standard is not a perfect one, its sensitivity and specificity must be calibrated against more accurate tests or against the definition of the condition. This calibration is especially important when a perfect test is available only by autopsy. A test has to meet some interobserver agreement, to avoid some bias induced by the study itself. Calibration errors can lead to misdiagnosis.

==Ambiguity==

Sometimes &quot;gold standard test&quot; refers to the best-performing test available. In these cases, there is no other criterion against which it can be compared and it is equivalent to a definition. When referring to this meaning, gold standard tests are normally not performed at all. This is because the gold standard test may be difficult to perform or may be impossible to perform on a living person (i.e. the test is performed as part of an autopsy or may take too long for the results of the test to be available to be clinically useful).

Other times, the &quot;gold standard&quot; does not refer to the best-performing test available, but the best available under reasonable conditions. For example, in this sense, an MRI is the gold standard for brain tumor diagnosis, though it is not as good as a biopsy. In this case, the sensitivity and specificity of the gold standard are not 100% and it is said to be an &quot;imperfect gold standard&quot; or &quot;alloyed gold standard&quot;.

The term ground truth refers to the underlying absolute state of information; the gold standard strives to represent the ground truth as closely as possible. While the gold standard is the best effort to obtain the truth, ground truth is typically collected by direct observations. 

Some authors use the term &quot;golden standard&quot;. Claassen argues this usage is incorrect, as &quot;golden standard&quot; implies a level of perfection that is unattainable in medical science.

<text>(), usually known simply as Maersk ( ), is a Danish shipping and logistics company founded in 1904 by Arnold Peter Møller and his father Peter Mærsk Møller.

Maersk&#x27;s business activities include shipping, port operation, supply chain management and warehousing. The company is based in Copenhagen, Denmark, with subsidiaries and offices across 130 countries and over 100,000 employees worldwide in 2024.

It is a publicly traded family business, as the company is controlled by the namesake Møller family through holding companies. The company&#x27;s 2024 annual revenue was US$55.5 billion.

Maersk has faced several challenges, including the global economic downturn, a malware attack, and the Red Sea crisis.

== History ==

 was founded in Svendborg in April 1904 by captain Peter Mærsk Møller (1836–1927) and his son Arnold Peter (A. P.) Møller (1876–1965). A. P. Møller had four children, all by his first wife Chastine Estelle Roberta Mc-Kinney. Their second child was (Arnold) Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller (1913–2012), who became a partner in 1939 and head of the firm upon his father&#x27;s death. In 1993, he was succeeded as CEO by Jess Søderberg. He continued as chairman until December 2003, when he was 90, and Michael Pram Rasmussen took over. Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller was, until his death, one of the &quot;managing owners&quot; of the company and was chairman of Odense Steel Shipyard until 2 May 2006.

A.P. Moller - Maersk announced its strategic choice to separate its oil and gas-related operations from the conglomerate structure and to concentrate only on container logistics in 2016. The majority shareholding in Maersk Tankers was sold to A.P. Moller Holding in 2017. Maersk Oil was sold to TOTAL S.A. in 2018, and Maersk Drilling became a separately listed company in April 2019.

In 2017, the company was one of the main victims of the NotPetya ransom malware attack, which severely disrupted its operation for several months.

In 2021, the company bought 8 carbon-neutral ships for £1bn.

In August 2021, Maersk joined the BEC Low-Carbon Charter.

In September 2023, Maersk unveiled Laura Mærsk, which uses methanol as a fuel. Laura Mærsk is a feeder vessel of 2,100 TEU capacity in service on the Baltic Sea. In June of 2023, Maersk also announced an order for six additional mid-sized container vessels of 9,000 TEU capacity. 

In November 2023, Maersk signed an agreement with Chinese developer Goldwind. The agreement looks to secure annual volumes of 500KT of fuels including bio-methanol and e-methanol produced utilising wind energy at a new production facility in Hinggan League, Northeast China, around 1000km northeast of Beijing. The first volumes are expected to arrive in 2026.

===Maersk Logo===
The Maersk logo is a white, seven-pointed star on a pale blue background. The logo dates back to 1886 when it was used on Captain P. M. Møller&#x27;s first steamer, the s.s. LAURA. The story relates to an episode where Captain Møller&#x27;s wife, Anna, had accompanied him on a sea voyage and fallen seriously ill. The deeply devout Captain Møller prayed for his wife&#x27;s recovery, and she did recover.

In a letter dated October 6, 1886, he wrote to her: &quot;The little star on the funnel is a reminder of the evening I prayed for you so dejectedly and anxiously, asking for the sign that I might see a star in the grey, overcast sky, a reminder that the Lord hears our prayers.&quot;

When The Steamship Company Svendborg was founded in 1904, the seven-pointed star on the pale blue background became its funnel emblem and the company&#x27;s house flag symbol. When The Steamship Company of 1912 was established, the seven-pointed star was also chosen as their logo.

The white seven-pointed star has been synonymous with Maersk throughout the years, but the logo has undergone some minor changes. The last changes date back to the early 1970s when Maersk enlisted the Danish designer and architect Acton Bjørn to help with a more modern design, which is still used today.

== Transport and logistics ==

=== Maersk ===


The largest operating unit in A. P. Moller–Maersk by revenue and staff (around 25,000 employees in 2012) is Maersk Line. In 2013, the company described itself as the world&#x27;s largest overseas cargo carrier and operated over 600 vessels with 3.8 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) container capacity. As of January 2021, as the largest container fleet, it held 17% of the global TEU.

In 2006, the largest container ship in the world to that date, the vessel , was delivered to Maersk Line from Odense Steel Shipyard. Since then, seven other sister ships have been built, and on 21 February 2011 Maersk ordered ten even larger container ships from Daewoo, the , each with a capacity of 18,000 containers. The first was delivered in 2013. There was an option for 10–20 more, and in June 2011, Maersk placed a follow-on order for a second batch of ten sister ships (to the same design with the same shipyard), but cancelled its option for a third batch of ten.

As of February 2010, Maersk had an order book for new ships totaling 857000TEU (including options on the Triple E class); that backlog is larger than the existing fleet of the fourth-largest line, Evergreen Line.

Maersk Line cooperated with the United States Navy on testing 7–100% algae biofuel on the Maersk Kalmar in December 2011.

In January 2012, Søren Skou took over as CEO of Maersk Line from Eivind Kolding.

=== Maersk Oil ===
Maersk Oil (Danish: Mærsk Olie og Gas A/S) was established in 1962 when Maersk was awarded a concession for oil and gas exploration and production in the Danish sector of the North Sea. Maersk Oil is engaged in exploring and producing oil and gas in many parts of the world. Total oil production is more than 600,000 barrels per day (95,000 m³/d) and gas production is up to some 1 billion cubic feet (28,000,000 m³) per day. Most of this production is from the North Sea, from both the Danish and British sectors, but there is also production in offshore Qatar, Algeria and Kazakhstan.

In addition to the above-mentioned producing sites, Maersk Oil is involved in exploration activities in Danish, British, Dutch and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, Qatar, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Angola, Gulf of Mexico (US sector), Turkmenistan, Oman, Morocco, Brazil, Colombia and Suriname. Most of these activities are not 100% owned but are via membership in a consortium. The company developed production techniques for complex environments (The North Sea, etc.) and drilling techniques that extract oil from problematic underground conditions.

Oil and gas activities provided A .P. Moller–Maersk with 22% of its revenue and 68% of its profit in 2008. On 21 August 2017, A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S announced the signing of an agreement to sell Mærsk Olie og Gas A/S to Total S.A. for US$7.45  billion in a combined share and debt transaction. The transaction was subject to regulatory and competition approval and was closed on 8 March 2018, when Maersk Oil became a part of Total.

== Maersk and Danish climate targets ==
A.P. Møller-Maersk company accounts for over 80% of the Danish top 30 companies&#x27; emissions of carbon dioxide from operations. Mærsk has increased emissions by 2% since 2019, with a total of 37 million tonnes in 2021. The company presented plans to be CO2 neutral by 2040.

Since the Danish climate targets of a 70 per cent CO2 reduction in 2030 are territorial based, emissions from foreign shipping and aviation from Danish ports and airports, and internationally, are not counted, as the responsibility lies with the UN&#x27;s organizations for aviation (ICAO) and shipping (IMO). However, IMO has committed to halving the industry&#x27;s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, and because 80% of global trade (around 11 billion tonnes) is transported by sea each year, global shipping generated about 1,000 million tonnes (3%) of carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. From territorial based point of view, the Maersk fleet is not obliged to make reductions, but instead pay through slightly higher taxes from the emissions to a fund based on taxes from the fleets use of bunker fuel, which will be able to compensate and finance climate measures, a concept developed by the Ministry of Climate and the Danish Maritime Authority.

In 2008, it was calculated by the DK Group that the Maersk fleet together released just over one million tonnes of sulfur dioxide SO2 per year from the fleets use of bunker fuel, and at the time until 2014, when China Shipping Lanes took over by one meter and 20 percent less fuel emissions, the world&#x27;s largest container ship Emma Mærsk emits SO2 equivalent to 50 million cars.

&quot;These are figures that are publicly available. But they have probably not really come to light because shipping has been totally unregulated. But when the biggest ships sail out, you have to imagine that 50 million cars will follow,&quot; says Jørn Winkler, founder of DK Group. For example, there are filters that remove virtually all sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, but the price of a filter for a large container ship is DKK 25 million. By comparison, Maersk uses approximately DKK 46 billion worth of fuel per year (expenses deducted as a cost in company tax calculations), and &quot;In the past 20 years, it has been possible to remove the particles from the ships&#x27; exhaust fumes, but the will to do something is lacking,&quot; says Jørn Winkler in 2008.

The Danish Ministry of the Environment has in 2009 initiated an action plan, where the requirement is that SOx and NOx must be reduced using desulfurization plants, the so-called scrubbers, to build into the ships&#x27; chimney systems, where the smoke gets showered to benefit the air, but researchers at the Department of Aquatic Resources, DTU Aqua, find that this pollution, by a lot of heavy metals and tar substances, so-called polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are moved from the fuel into the sea instead, and thereby also poses a danger to the marine environment, as heavy metals do not break down and are taken up by plankton, from where they travel further up through the food chain - right up to fish. Environmentalist organizations however believe that the shipping companies have installed scrubbers on their ships so that they can continue to sail on cheap heavy bunker oil, which contains many environmentally harmful substances.

In 2023, Maersk became the first in the shipping industry to have its 2030 and 2040 targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in alignment with a 1.5°C and net zero pathway under SBTi’s new maritime industry guidance. These new targets include specific sub-targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and will replace previous targets announced in early 2022.

=== Maersk and tonnage taxation ===
Denmark is the world&#x27;s 11th largest flag state based on gross tonnage (the indication of a ship&#x27;s size, ed.) in 2022, and the shipping companies account for approximately one-fifth of Denmark&#x27;s total exports. According to the industry association Danish shipping, the latest figure for Danish-flagged ships is 779 ships with a total tonnage of 23.24 million gross registered tonnes, out of more than 50,000 merchant ships that trade internationally, under the flags of 150 nations.

Shipping companies in Denmark have a unique tax scheme – tonnage tax, which has been in force since 2001 to keep the shipping companies on Danish soil. Tonnage tax means that shipping companies pay a fixed tax or charge per ship, and the amount is thus not affected by the company&#x27;s profit. With the tonnage tax, the shipping companies avoid the classic corporation tax of 22 per cent, which other companies must pay. On top of that, Maersk receives an unknown amount of state aid through the so-called DIS scheme, which allows the shipping company to pay tax-free salary to the crews, and thereby the tax saved then accrues to the shipping companies as state aid in the form of lower labor costs, which for the four years 2017–2020 are calculated at DKK 925, 925, 1,050 and 1,100 million respectively.

The tax scheme means that in 2021, Maersk should pay around 4% of a record-breaking earnings of about 16,08 billion USD (117.5 billion Danish kroner) before tax, but in reality paid 100.66 million US$ (697 million DKK) or 0.6 percent in tax to Denmark in 2021, according to the company&#x27;s annual accounts, and much lower than the shipping company itself states in its published tax returns. The profit was expected to be DKK 270 billion in 2022, but ended to be 203 billion DKK in profit, and thought to pay the equivalent of three percent in tax (6.09 billion DDK), but in reality by Maersk tax statement for 2022, the tax payment in Denmark is calculated at 0.7 percent, but according to finance calculations, it suggests that the real share that ends up in the Danish treasury, will be less than 0.2 percent, according to Berlingske. But DKK 80 billion is calculated on its way to the shareholders of Maersk, where 45.23 percent is owned by 82,000 different shareholders in Denmark and abroad.

This compared to a deficit of DKK 3 billion in the company&#x27;s accounts for the first half of 2009. – The first deficit in the group&#x27;s history since World War II, with an expected deficit for the whole of 2009 of DKK 10.7 billion.

To keep this lucrative taxation scheme, compared to classic corporation tax, Maersk has met with the Ministry of Taxation and the Danish Maritime Authority and worked against a global minimum tax for the shipping industry with success, as their lobby meetings helped to exempt shipping from a global tax agreement, as a major deal on minimum tax was adopted by 135 countries under the OECD in 2021, which must ensure that international companies pay more in tax and minimum 15 percent, but precisely the shipping industry was exempted from the agreement. These meetings happened even though Maersk said publicly that they were open to paying more taxes if it happened through a global agreement. A strategy defended by the Social Democratic Minister for Taxation in 2023, &#x27;Nothing abnormal&#x27; in that they have opposed global minimum tax.

To supply the Danish and international shipping companies, Denmark, even of its very small size of 43.094 km2 and a population of 5,932,654 in 2023, that by World Happiness Report in 2022 was voted as the world&#x27;s second happiest population, and has been voted the world&#x27;s happiest country several times due to coziness or &quot;hygge&quot;, is also home country for several of the world&#x27;s top 10 largest suppliers of bunker fuel and other ship and aircraft fuels, like the earlier OW Bunker, founded in 1980, was a marine fuel (bunker) company based at Nørresundby, near Aalborg in northern Denmark, that was the world&#x27;s largest bunker supplier until its collapse on 7 November 2014. A lead now controlled by the Danish group Dan-Bunkering&#x27;s owner company Bunker Holding, also known as Bunker Holding Group, and represented in 33 countries, is by 2022 the world&#x27;s leading supplier and retailer of ship fuels, specializing since 1981 in the purchase, sale and delivery of fuel and lubricating oil for ships, but which on 14 December 2021 was convicted for violation of EU sanctions against supplies to Syria, to protect the civilian population from attacks by bombers, when the Danish billion worth company, via agreements through its branch office in Kaliningrad in Russia with two Russian companies, Joint Stock Company Sovfracht and Maritime Assistance LLC, who were agents for the Russian Navy, and at several occasions from higher levels was informed of there violation, delivered jet fuel under cover of darkness, transshipped from one ship to another on the high seas, for use by the Russian military, a regular supplier for more than 30 years, to use in the petrol tanks of Russian fighter aircraft that have been air raid bombing Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad, with a fine of DKK 30 million for having sold 172,000 tonnes of jet fuel through 33 deals worth around DKK 648 million, and confiscation of the profit of around DKK 15 million and fined DKK four million, as well as a conditional discharge of four months in prison for the managing director of Bunker Holding, for having acted negligently, but not intentionally, as Dan-Bunkering&#x27;s owner company Bunker Holding was found guilty of participating in eight of the transactions, it was fined DKK four million, a sentence not appealed against by Dan-Bunkering and Bunker Holding, &quot;has the full confidence of the board and the owners&quot;, nor by the State Attorney for Special Economic and International Crime (SØIK), that didn&#x27;t find reasons to appeal to increase the sentence, even a demand for two years&#x27; imprisonment and specified &quot;the fuel has gone to Russian fighter jets, which on behalf of Assad have bombed Syria with the help of a total of 172,000 tons of jet fuel sold from the company headquarters in Middelfart via the two Russian companies in the period 2015 to 2017, and the EU introduced sanctions against Syria in 2014&quot;, expanded its lead as the world&#x27;s largest bunker oil supplier in 2020, shows a report from the research house Seacred and the media Ship &amp; Bunker, a location Bunker Holding, owned by United Shipping &amp; Trading Company (USTC), has expanded from 2020, if measured in terms of volumes, which is particularly connected with Bunker Holding&#x27;s purchase of Oceanconnect Marine, which is today merged with Bunker Holding&#x27;s subsidiary KPI Bridge Oil. In addition, the subsidiary Bunker One is responsible for the physical delivery of marine fuel throughout the world, and is actively engaged in a number of green projects with, among other things, ammonia and methanol as ship fuel based on electricity from windmills (wind turbines) and PV solar cells.

== Piracy ==

On the morning of 8 April 2009, the 17,000-ton was en route to Mombasa, Kenya, when it was hijacked by pirates off the Somali coast. The company confirmed that the US-flagged vessel had 20 US nationals on board. This was the first time that the US had to deal with a situation in which Americans were aboard a ship seized by pirates in over 200 years. By noon, the Americans could resist the pirates and regain control of the boat. However, the pirates retreated on a covered lifeboat and held the captain hostage for four days. On 12 April 2009, it was confirmed that the captain held hostage was freed by the US Navy, whose SEAL sharpshooters killed three of the pirates. A fourth pirate surrendered earlier due to a medical injury. These events were subsequently dramatized in the 2013 film &quot;Captain Phillips&quot;, directed by Paul Greengrass, starring Tom Hanks in the titular role.

Maersk Line estimated that piracy costs the company $100 million per year due to longer routes and higher speed, particularly near East Africa.

As of 2010, all 83 Maersk tankers were diverting around the Cape of Good Hope south of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal, although , the first of the Triple E-class vessels, successfully navigated the Suez during her maiden voyage.

== Criticism ==
=== Labor practices in El Salvador and China ===
Trade unions and labor rights organizations have criticized Maersk&#x27;s labor practices in different parts of the world.

In El Salvador, Maersk has been accused of maintaining abusive conditions for port drivers. Charges include excessively long shifts, minimal wages and the repression of freedom of association by running union-busting campaigns, including firing and blacklisting at least 100 drivers in 2001.

Globalization Monitor, a labor rights group based in Hong Kong, has reported poor labor conditions in Maersk facilities in Dongguan and Qingdao, China. In January and May 2008, two riots reportedly broke out amongst workers at the Maersk plant in Dongguan in protest of poor working conditions and employment terms. In April 2011, Globalization Monitor stated, &quot;Maersk&#x27;s plants in China are still far from satisfactory as long as labor and human rights are concerned.&quot; 

=== Overcharging allegations of US Government in Iraq and Afghanistan ===
In response to a complaint from whistleblower Jerry H. Brown II, the US Government filed suit against Maersk for overcharging for shipments to US forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a settlement announced on 3 January 2012, the company agreed to pay $31.9 million in fines and interest but made no admission of wrongdoing. Brown was entitled to $3.6 million of the settlement.

=== Violation of embargo on Sudan ===
In August 2010, the US government fined Maersk $3.1 million for violating its embargo on Sudan. &quot;Maersk had a waiver from the US government to deliver US Food Aid into Sudan, so the US-flagged ship was in Port Sudan to deliver humanitarian aid,&quot; a U.S. government spokesman said, but &quot;the booking systems did not identify cargo that was coming on and off the ship, and that could be of violation of the embargo&quot;. The US government imposed a trade embargo on Sudan in 1997 due to human rights violations linked to the civil war between the north and south of the African country and also because of the regime&#x27;s alleged support of international terrorist groups.

===Business with Iran===
In July 2010, the advocacy group initially highlighted Maersk&#x27;s ties to a blacklisted Iranian company, Tidewater Middle East Co. The firm suspended operations at several Iranian ports owned by Tidewater Middle East Co. Maersk operates in other Bangladeshi ports and also diverted shipments to Dubai, partnering with other Bangladeshi companies that are not bound by U.S. sanctions.

On 28 April 2015, the Marshall Islands-flagged container ship &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot;, which was not owned by Maersk, was travelling westbound through the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval patrol boats contacted the ship and directed it to proceed into Iranian territorial waters, according to a spokesman for the US Defense Department. When the ship&#x27;s master declined, one of the Iranian craft fired shots across the bridge of &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot;. The master complied and proceeded into Iranian waters near Larak Island. The US Navy sent aircraft and a destroyer, , to monitor the situation.

Maersk stated they have agreed to pay an Iranian company $163,000 over a dispute about ten container boxes transported to Dubai in 2005. The court ruling allegedly ordered a fine of $3.6 million.

=== Regulation violations and contract fraud ===
In October 2010, Maersk plead guilty to 8 counts of failing to provide adequate hours of rest and 1 count of failing to improve the situation.

In February 2014, Maersk paid 8.7 million to settle allegations that Maersk had forged documents on a contract to ship cargo to Afghanistan. The government says they uncovered 277 instances &quot;in which claims verifying receipt of shipments in Afghanistan contained forged signatures.&quot; The settlement included no admission of guilt.

=== Sexual harassment suspensions and lawsuits ===
In May 2021, a Maersk officer&#x27;s license was suspended after he was accused of sexual assault, including abusive, unwanted, and inappropriate touching in violation of Maersk&#x27;s anti-harassment policy. On 12 October 2021, Maersk suspended five employees for their involvement in the rape of a 19-year-old girl.

In June 2022, Hope Hicks, formerly known as &quot;Midshipman X&quot; filed a lawsuit against Maersk, alleging that the company failed to protect her from rampant sexual abuse. In the same month, a second US Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) student under the alias &quot;Midshipman Y&quot; filed a suit against Maersk, also alleging that the company did not protect her from sexual abuse and violence.

=== Pollution from fuels ===
In 2009, it was estimated that the Maersk fleet&#x27;s use of bunker fuel released sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, into the atmosphere corresponding to the emissions from 9 billion cars, with resultant serious health, environmental, and climate change impacts related.

One of the health problems with nitrogen oxides, in particular, is, that an ethnically diverse cohort of 161,808 postmenopausal women, participated in a study published in 2023, found nitrogen oxides to be a major contributor to the bone deterioration in postmenopausal women, where one in two women over 50 years experiencing a bone fracture, and the lumbar spine is one of the most susceptible sites of damage from it, and is found twice as destructive as normal ageing, with effects believed to happen through bone cell death by oxidative stress and other mechanisms.

For example, lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) decreased 0.026 g/cm2/year per a 10% increase in 3-year mean NO2 concentration, or the amount to 1.22 per cent annual reductions, nearly double the annual effects of age on any of the anatomical sites evaluated.

The health problem with bunker fuel (heavy fuel oil), a type of oil used in 80 per cent of the world&#x27;s merchant ships in 2008, with a total consumption of 290 million tons per year is, that it has a very high sulfur content followed by sulfur dioxide, which smokes directly from the chimney, after which it spreads and can make people sick or even be lethal,&quot; says Jørgen Brandt, who is a senior researcher at the Department of Atmospheric Environment at Aarhus University. Mærsk is aware of the extent of the problem. Ivan Seistrup, group vice-president in A.P. Møller Mærsk, stated in 2009: &quot;Among other things, we have entered into close cooperation with Boeing on the development of biofuel for the shipping industry, which will constitute a technological quantum leap. One solution could be to sail on clean biofuel in coastal areas, and then use bunker fuel in the open sea, where it does no harm.&quot;

The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel. However, scientists and research of Norwegian Vestlandsforskning have found that biodiesel can increase the risk of cancer, caused by two molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), which is formed from fossil diesel, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), formed from biodiesel, and also show an ecotoxicological profile of both urban and rural air pollution.

=== Contravention of Maritime Organisation’s SOLAS Convention and cloaking ===
In August 2024, the South African Govnernment was alerted to two Maersk chartered ships (&quot;Campton&quot; and &quot;Candor)&quot; carrying approximately 816 total metric tonnes on board the two ships in 100 short containers of toxic steel furnace dust collected from pollution control filters. The containers were collected from Albania to be delivered to Thailand, passing around the south of Africa on route. The containers in question that potentially could contain mis-declared/hazardous waste cargo were picked up by Maersk (on behalf of MSC) in Trieste and were to be unloaded in Singapore.

The Basel Action Network (BAN) alerted the South African government to the fact that the Automatic Identification System (AIS) GPS beacon of the Maersk &quot;Campton&quot; was switched off on 31 July 2024 in contravention of the Maritime Organisation’s SOLAS Convention and failed to make its scheduled docking in Cape Town. The practice, known as cloaking, can be used for illegitimate purposes, e.g. to hide the location of a ship in cases where illegal dumping of waste takes place. Cloaking however is also used for legitimate reasons such as security concerns, e.g. to protect vessels in transit near the Red Sea from being targeted by terrorist groups. The containers are currently being repatriated from Singapore to Albania by MSC on their ship &quot;Maria Saveria&quot;.

=== Business with Israel ===
In November 2024, a Maersk container ship &#x27;Denver&#x27; was denied entry to the Spanish port of Algeciras, due to allegations that the ship was carrying arms supplies to Israel. 

On February 24, 2025, Maersk&#x27;s headquarters in Copenhagen was the target of a mass protest action by activists over the transportation of US government military equipment in relation to the Gaza war. Police cleared the protestors using batons and tear gas after they refused to leave after repeated requests, resulting in the arrest of 22 people. Greta Thunberg was among those arrested.

== NotPetya malware attack ==
On 27 June 2017, Maersk IT systems were the victim of a malware attack utilizing NotPetya, which was designed to appear to be a ransomware attack. The cyberattack was perpetrated by the Russian military cyberorganization, the GRU, and designed to attack Ukraine, but in fact almost destroyed Maersk Shipping. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine described the malware attack as the &#x27;Most Devastating Cyberattack in History.&#x27; In March 2020 Maersk revealed they would be terminating the employment and outsourcing the work of the UK based IT team that helped them successfully fend off and recover from the ransomware attack that shut down operations, as Maersk was forced to rebuild its IT infrastructure in 10 days and sustained losses of more than US$300 million to put on its tax relief as expenses.

<doc id="723008" wikidata="Q1734599" url="?curid=723008" title="The Spotlight">
<text>The Spotlight was a weekly newspaper in the United States, published in Washington, D.C. from September 1975 to July 2001 by the now-defunct antisemitic Liberty Lobby. &quot;The Spotlight&quot; ran articles and editorials professing a &quot;populist and nationalist&quot; political orientation. Some observers have described the publication as promoting a right-wing, or conservative, politics.

==Description==
&quot;The Spotlight&quot; has been described in media reports as promoting an America First position and giving positive coverage to the political campaigns of Pat Buchanan and David Duke. &quot;The Spotlight&quot; gave frequent coverage to complementary and alternative medicine, including advertisements for the purported anti-cancer supplement Laetrile. Kevin J. Flynn&#x27;s book &quot;The Silent Brotherhood&quot; described &quot;The Spotlight&quot; as regularly featuring &quot;articles on such topics as Bible analysis, taxes and fighting the IRS, bankers and how they bleed the middle class, and how the nation is manipulated by the dreaded Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations&quot;, adding &quot;the paper attracted a huge diversity of readers&quot;. NameBase described the newspaper as &quot;anti-elitist, opposed the Gulf War, wanted the JFK assassination reinvestigated, and felt that corruption and conspiracies can be found in high places&quot;.

==Circulation==
Circulation of &quot;The Spotlight&quot; peaked in 1981 at 315,000 but fell to about 90,000 by 1992. 

==Critical reaction==
&quot;The Spotlight&quot; was called &quot;the most widely read publication on the fringe right&quot; by the Anti-Defamation League, who also stated the newspaper &quot;reflected Carto&#x27;s conspiracy theory of history&quot; and called the paper anti-Semitic.

Howard J. Ruff in his 1979 book &quot;How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years&quot; praised &quot;The Spotlight&quot; for its investigative reporting, while criticizing it for a &quot;blatantly biased&quot; right-wing point of view and concluded &quot;there are many things I detest about it, but I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&quot;

U.S. Congressman and John Birch Society leader Larry McDonald criticized &quot;The Spotlight&quot; in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; in 1981 for purported use of the Lyndon LaRouche movement as a source of news items.

==Controversies==
===Lawsuit by E. Howard Hunt===
On August 14, 1978, &quot;The Spotlight&quot; published an article by Victor Marchetti linking former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Headlined &quot;CIA to Nail Hunt for Kennedy Killing&quot;, the article said: &quot;In the public hearings [of a pending Congressional hearing], the CIA will &#x27;admit&#x27; that Hunt was involved in the conspiracy to kill Kennedy.&quot; It also claimed that the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations had received an internal CIA memo from 1966 that stated the agency &quot;will have to explain Hunt&#x27;s presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963&quot;.

Stating that he was libeled by the accusations, Hunt sued the Liberty Lobby for $3.5 million in damages in a federal court in Miami in 1981; Marchetti was not named as a defendant. Hunt, represented by attorney Ellis Rubin, said that he suffered a $27,000 drop in income after the article was published. He also said that he was in Washington, D.C., on the day that Kennedy was killed. Miles McGrane, the attorney for Liberty Lobby stated that Liberty Lobby did not believe that Hunt was involved in the assassination, but that he was going to be made a scapegoat by the CIA. On December 17, 1981, the jury found in Hunt&#x27;s favor and awarded him $650,000 in damages. The decision was later overturned due to an error in jury instructions.

In the second trial, Hunt was represented by Baltimore attorney William Snyder. Hunt testified that he was in Washington, D.C., with his wife and son when he first heard of the assassination. Snyder told the jury that Hunt had already been cleared in the assassination by various commissions and inquiries. Attorney Mark Lane, author of &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; and a leading proponent of the theory that the CIA was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy, represented Liberty Lobby. Lane successfully defended Liberty Lobby against the defamation charges, which became the basis for Lane&#x27;s book &quot;Plausible Denial&quot;.

===Lawsuit by the National Review===
In 1985, the &quot;National Review&quot; and its editor, William F. Buckley Jr., were represented by attorney J. Daniel Mahoney during their $16 million libel suit against &quot;The Spotlight&quot;.

===Timothy McVeigh===
After the Oklahoma City bombing it was reported that Timothy McVeigh had taken out a classified advertisement in &quot;The Spotlight&quot; in August 1993 under the name &quot;T. Tuttle&quot; and had used a telephone card purchased from the newspaper.

==End of publication==
&quot;The Spotlight&quot; ceased publication in 2001 after Liberty Lobby was forced into bankruptcy as a result of a lawsuit brought by former associates in the Institute for Historical Review. Willis Carto and other people involved in &quot;The Spotlight&quot; then started a new newspaper, the &quot;American Free Press&quot;, which is very similar in overall tone. An August 2, 2002 court order in the Superior Court of California transferred the assets of Liberty Lobby, including &quot;The Spotlight&quot;, to the judgment creditor, the Legion for the Survival of Freedom, Inc. who maintains an online archive of &quot;Spotlight&quot; articles from 1997 to 2001.

==Other activities==
From 1988 to 2001, the paper sponsored the &quot;Radio Free America&quot; talk show which was heard on WWCR shortwave and on AM talk radio outlets.

<text>The river Bille () is a small, slow-flowing German river in Stormarn, Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg, a right tributary of the Elbe. Its source is near Linau, north of the Hahnheide forest. It then flows south of Trittau, representing the border between Stormarn and Lauenburg, continues south of Reinbek and reaches the river Elbe near Billwerder. A lot of old estates and tasteful parks are laid out along its riverbank. Its total length is 65 km. Sections of the Bille which flow near or inside the Sachsenwald forest are protected by the Billetal nature reserve.

The Bille is one of three rivers which flow through the city of Hamburg, the other two being the Elbe and the Alster.

==Tributaries==
The upper Bille drains a wide catchment area with many brooks and small stretches of water. Main tributaries are the Corbek feeding the Bille near Witzhave and the Schwarze Au at Aumühle, having drained wide parts of the large Sachsenwald forest.

<text>Aldwych tramway station (separate from Aldwych Underground station) was a tram stop underneath Kingsway, a road in central London, England. It was built in 1906 by the London County Council Tramways as part of the Kingsway tramway subway, joining the separate networks of tramways in North and South London.

==Services==
Tram services commenced on 24 February 1906, running from Angel through Holborn, the other station in the tram subway, to Aldwych. Through services across London began on 10 April 1908, running from Highbury station through Holborn and then east to Tower Bridge or south to Kennington Gate.

Following the decision to withdraw tram services in London and replace them with buses, the station closed just after 12.30am on 6 April 1952.

==Redevelopment==
In 1964, the Strand Underpass, a road tunnel, was opened to alleviate northbound traffic flow from Waterloo Bridge to Kingsway. The underpass took over a section of the tram subway, and rises at its north end through the site of the former Holborn tramway station. No sign of either of the former stations is visible on the surface or from the road tunnel.

<text>Holborn tramway station was a tram stop underneath Kingsway in central London, England. It was built in 1906 by the London County Council Tramways as part of the Kingsway tramway subway, joining the separate networks of tramways in North and South London. When opened it was named &quot;Great Queen Street&quot;.

==Services==
Tram services commenced on 24 February 1906, running from Angel to Aldwych, the next station in the subway. Through services across London began on 10 April 1908, running from Highbury station through Holborn and then east to Tower Bridge or south to Kennington Gate.

The routes that used the Kingsway Subway were numbered 31, 33, and 35.

Following the decision to withdraw tram services in London and replace them with buses, the station closed just after 12.30am on 6 April 1952. Much of the station remains in the disused subway but there is no public access. In 2004 it was expected that redevelopment work in the remaining subway would probably obliterate what remains exist.

==Alternative uses==
The station was used as a location in the 2008 film &quot;The Escapist&quot;, as a fictional London Underground station called &quot;Union Street&quot;, which was said to be on the Northern line between Elephant &amp; Castle and Borough. Remains of the film props, such as a fake tube map and a Union Street tube roundel, can still be seen pasted to the walls of the station. The props date from 2008, and are not part of the original station.

In 2009 the subway and station was the venue for an art installation, &quot;Chord&quot;, by Conrad Shawcross.

<doc id="723031" wikidata="Q2918240" url="?curid=723031" title="Orbital decay">
<text>Orbital decay is a gradual decrease of the distance between two orbiting bodies at their closest approach (the periapsis) over many orbital periods. These orbiting bodies can be a planet and its satellite, a star and any object orbiting it, or components of any binary system. If left unchecked, the decay eventually results in termination of the orbit when the smaller object strikes the surface of the primary; or for objects where the primary has an atmosphere, the smaller object burns, explodes, or otherwise breaks up in the larger object&#x27;s atmosphere; or for objects where the primary is a star, ends with incineration by the star&#x27;s radiation (such as for comets). Collisions of stellar-mass objects are usually accompanied by effects such as gamma-ray bursts and detectable gravitational waves.

Orbital decay is caused by one or more mechanisms which absorb energy from the orbital motion, such as fluid friction, gravitational anomalies, or electromagnetic effects. For bodies in low Earth orbit, the most significant effect is atmospheric drag.

Due to atmospheric drag, the lowest altitude above the Earth at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately 150 km (93 mi) while the lowest perigee of an elliptical revolution is approximately 90 km (56 mi).

== Modeling ==

=== Simplified model ===
A simplified decay model for a near-circular two-body orbit about a central body (or planet) with an atmosphere, in terms of the rate of change of the orbital altitude, is given below.

:formula_1

Where R is the distance of the spacecraft from the planet&#x27;s origin, αo is the sum of all accelerations projected on the along-track direction of the spacecraft (or parallel to the spacecraft velocity vector), and T is the Keplerian period. Note that αo is often a function of R due to variations in atmospheric density in the altitude, and T is a function of R by virtue of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.

If only atmospheric drag is considered, one can approximate drag deceleration αo as a function of orbit radius R using the drag equation below:

:formula_2

::formula_3 is the mass density of the atmosphere which is a function of the radius R from the origin,
::formula_4 is the orbital velocity,
::formula_5 is the drag reference area,
::formula_6 is the mass of the satellite, and
::formula_7 is the dimensionless drag coefficient related to the satellite geometry, and accounting for skin friction and form drag (~2.2 for cube satellites).

The orbit decay model has been tested against ~1 year of actual GPS measurements of VELOX-C1, where the mean decay measured via GPS was 2.566 km across Dec 2015 to Nov 2016, and the orbit decay model predicted a decay of 2.444 km, which amounted to a 5% deviation.

An open-source Python based software, ORBITM (ORBIT Maintenance and Propulsion Sizing), is available freely on GitHub for Python users using the above model.

=== Proof of simplified model ===

By the conservation of mechanical energy, the energy of the orbit is simply the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energies, in an unperturbed two-body orbit. By substituting the vis-viva equation into the kinetic energy component, the orbital energy of a circular orbit is given by:

:formula_8

Where G is the gravitational constant, ME is the mass of the central body and m is the mass of the orbiting satellite. We take the derivative of the orbital energy with respect to the radius.

:formula_9

The total decelerating force, which is usually atmospheric drag for low Earth orbits, exerted on a satellite of constant mass m is given by some force F. The rate of loss of orbital energy is simply the rate at the external force does negative work on the satellite as the satellite traverses an infinitesimal circular arc-length ds, spanned by some infinitesimal angle dθ and angular rate ω.

:formula_10

The angular rate ω is also known as the Mean motion, where for a two-body circular orbit of radius R, it is expressed as:

:formula_11

and...

:formula_12

Substituting ω into the rate of change of orbital energy above, and expressing the external drag or decay force in terms of the deceleration αo, the orbital energy rate of change with respect to time can be expressed as:

:formula_13

Having an equation for the rate of change of orbital energy with respect to both radial distance and time allows us to find the rate of change of the radial distance with respect to time as per below.

:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16

The assumptions used in this derivation above are that the orbit stays very nearly circular throughout the decay process, so that the equations for orbital energy are more or less that of a circular orbit&#x27;s case. This is often true for orbits that begin as circular, as drag forces are considered &quot;re-circularizing&quot;, since drag magnitudes at the periapsis (lower altitude) is expectedly greater than that of the apoapsis, which has the effect of reducing the mean eccentricity.

==Sources of decay==

===Atmospheric drag===

Atmospheric drag at orbital altitude is caused by frequent collisions of gas molecules with the satellite.
It is the major cause of orbital decay for satellites in low Earth orbit. It results in the reduction in the altitude of a satellite&#x27;s orbit. For the case of Earth, atmospheric drag resulting in satellite re-entry can be described by the following sequence:

: lower altitude → denser atmosphere → increased drag → increased heat → usually burns on re-entry

Orbital decay thus involves a positive feedback effect, where the more the orbit decays, the lower its altitude drops, and the lower the altitude, the faster the decay. Decay is also particularly sensitive to external factors of the space environment such as solar activity, which are not very predictable. During solar maxima the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere causes significant drag up to altitudes much higher than during solar minima.

Atmospheric drag exerts a significant effect at the altitudes of space stations, Space Shuttles and other crewed Earth-orbit spacecraft, and satellites with relatively high &quot;low Earth orbits&quot; such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Space stations typically require a regular altitude boost to counteract orbital decay (see also orbital station-keeping). Uncontrolled orbital decay brought down the Skylab space station, and (relatively) controlled orbital decay was used to de-orbit the Mir space station.

Reboosts for the Hubble Space Telescope are less frequent due to its much higher altitude. However, orbital decay is also a limiting factor to the length of time the Hubble can go without a maintenance rendezvous, the most recent having been performed successfully by STS-125, with Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; in 2009. Newer space telescopes are in much higher orbits, or in some cases in solar orbit, so orbital boosting may not be needed.

=== Tidal effects ===
An orbit can also decay by negative tidal acceleration when the orbiting body is large enough to raise a significant tidal bulge on the body it is orbiting and is either in a retrograde orbit or is below the synchronous orbit. This saps angular momentum from the orbiting body and transfers it to the primary&#x27;s rotation, lowering the orbit&#x27;s altitude.

Examples of satellites undergoing tidal orbital decay are Mars&#x27; moon Phobos, Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, and the extrasolar planet TrES-3b.

===Light and thermal radiation===

Small objects in the Solar System also experience an orbital decay due to the forces applied by asymmetric radiation pressure. Ideally, energy absorbed would equal blackbody energy emitted at any given point, resulting in no net force. However, the Yarkovsky effect is the phenomenon that, because absorption and radiation of heat are not instantaneous, objects which are not tidally locked absorb sunlight energy on surfaces exposed to the Sun, but those surfaces do not re-emit much of that energy until after the object has rotated, so that the emission is parallel to the object&#x27;s orbit. This results in a very small acceleration parallel to the orbital path, yet one which can be significant for small objects over millions of years. The Poynting-Robertson effect is a force opposing the object&#x27;s velocity caused by asymmetric incidence of light, i.e., aberration of light. For an object with prograde rotation, these two effects will apply opposing, but generally unequal, forces.

=== Gravitational radiation ===

Gravitational radiation is another mechanism of orbital decay. It is negligible for orbits of planets and planetary satellites (when considering their orbital motion on time scales of centuries, decades, and less), but is noticeable for systems of compact objects, as seen in observations of neutron star orbits. All orbiting bodies radiate gravitational energy, hence no orbit is infinitely stable.

=== Electromagnetic drag ===

Satellites using an electrodynamic tether, moving through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, create drag force that could eventually deorbit the satellite.

==Stellar collision==

A stellar collision is the coming together of two binary stars when they lose energy and approach each other. Several things can cause the loss of energy including tidal forces, mass transfer, and gravitational radiation. The stars describe the path of a spiral as they approach each other. This sometimes results in a merger of the two stars or the creation of a black hole. In the latter case, the last several revolutions of the stars around each other take only a few seconds.

==Mass concentration==

While not a direct cause of orbital decay, uneven mass distributions (known as &quot;mascons&quot;) of the body being orbited can perturb orbits over time, and extreme distributions can cause orbits to be highly unstable. The resulting unstable orbit can mutate into an orbit where one of the direct causes of orbital decay can take place.

<text>Aun the Old (Old Norse &quot;Aunn inn gamli&quot;, Latinized &quot;Auchun&quot;, Proto-Norse &quot;*Audawiniʀ&quot;: English: &quot;Edwin the Old&quot;) is a mythical Swedish king of the House of Yngling in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.
Aun was the son of Jorund, and had ten sons, nine of which he was said to have sacrificed in order to prolong his own life. Based on the internal chronology of the House of Yngling, Aun would have died late in the fifth century.
He was succeeded by his son Egil Vendelcrow (&quot;Íslendingabók&quot;: &quot;Egill Vendilkráka&quot;)
identified with Ongentheow of the &quot;Beowulf&quot; narrative and placed in the early sixth century.

==Ynglingatal==
Ruling from his seat in Uppsala, Aun was reputedly a wise king who made sacrifices to the gods. However, he was not of a warlike disposition and preferred to live in peace. He was attacked and defeated by the Danish prince Halfdan. Aun fled to the Geats in Västergötland, where he stayed for 25 years until Halfdan died in his bed in Uppsala.

Upon Halfdan&#x27;s death Aun returned to Uppsala. Aun was now 60 years old, and in an attempt to live longer he sacrificed his son to Odin, who had promised that this would mean he would live for another 60 years. After 25 years, Aun was attacked by Halfdan&#x27;s cousin Ale the Strong. Aun lost several battles and had to flee a second time to Västergötland. Ale the Strong ruled in Uppsala for 25 years until he was killed by Starkad the old.

After Ale the Strong&#x27;s death, Aun once again returned to Uppsala and once again sacrificed a son to Odin; this time Odin told the king that he would remain living as long as he sacrificed a son every ten years and that he had to name one of the Swedish provinces after the number of sons he sacrificed.

When Aun had sacrificed a son for the seventh time, he was so old that he could not walk but had to be carried on a chair. When he had sacrificed a son for the eighth time, he could no longer get out of his bed. When he had sacrificed his ninth son, he was so old that he had to feed, like a little child, by suckling on a horn.

After ten years he wanted to sacrifice his tenth and last son and name the province of Uppsala &quot;The Ten Lands&quot;. However, the Swedes refused to allow him to make this sacrifice and so he died. He was buried in a mound at Uppsala and succeeded by his last son Egil. 
From that day, dying in bed of old age was called &quot;Aun&#x27;s sickness&quot;.

<doc id="723043" wikidata="Q739925" url="?curid=723043" title="Family of sets">
<text>In set theory and related branches of mathematics, a family (or collection) can mean, depending upon the context, any of the following: set, indexed set, multiset, or class. A collection formula_1 of subsets of a given set formula_2 is called a family of subsets of formula_2, or a family of sets over formula_4 More generally, a collection of any sets whatsoever is called a family of sets, set family, or a set system. Additionally, a family of sets may be defined as a function from a set formula_5, known as the index set, to formula_1, in which case the sets of the family are indexed by members of formula_5. In some contexts, a family of sets may be allowed to contain repeated copies of any given member, and in other contexts it may form a proper class.

A finite family of subsets of a finite set formula_2 is also called a &quot;hypergraph&quot;. The subject of extremal set theory concerns the largest and smallest examples of families of sets satisfying certain restrictions.

==Examples==

The set of all subsets of a given set formula_2 is called the power set of formula_2 and is denoted by formula_11 The power set formula_12 of a given set formula_2 is a family of sets over formula_4 

A subset of formula_2 having formula_16 elements is called a formula_16-subset of formula_4 
The formula_16-subsets formula_20 of a set formula_2 form a family of sets. 

Let formula_22 An example of a family of sets over formula_2 (in the multiset sense) is given by formula_24 where formula_25 and formula_26

The class formula_27 of all ordinal numbers is a &quot;large&quot; family of sets. That is, it is not itself a set but instead a proper class.

==Properties==

Any family of subsets of a set formula_2 is itself a subset of the power set formula_12 if it has no repeated members. 

Any family of sets without repetitions is a subclass of the proper class of all sets (the universe). 

Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem, due to Philip Hall, gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite family of non-empty sets (repetitions allowed) to have a system of distinct representatives.

If formula_30 is any family of sets then formula_31 denotes the union of all sets in formula_32 where in particular, formula_33 
Any family formula_30 of sets is a family over formula_35 and also a family over any superset of formula_36

==Related concepts==

Certain types of objects from other areas of mathematics are equivalent to families of sets, in that they can be described purely as a collection of sets of objects of some type:
* A hypergraph, also called a set system, is formed by a set of vertices together with another set of &quot;hyperedges&quot;, each of which may be an arbitrary set. The hyperedges of a hypergraph form a family of sets, and any family of sets can be interpreted as a hypergraph that has the union of the sets as its vertices.
* An abstract simplicial complex is a combinatorial abstraction of the notion of a simplicial complex, a shape formed by unions of line segments, triangles, tetrahedra, and higher-dimensional simplices, joined face to face. In an abstract simplicial complex, each simplex is represented simply as the set of its vertices. Any family of finite sets without repetitions in which the subsets of any set in the family also belong to the family forms an abstract simplicial complex.
* An incidence structure consists of a set of &quot;points&quot;, a set of &quot;lines&quot;, and an (arbitrary) binary relation, called the &quot;incidence relation&quot;, specifying which points belong to which lines. An incidence structure can be specified by a family of sets (even if two distinct lines contain the same set of points), the sets of points belonging to each line, and any family of sets can be interpreted as an incidence structure in this way.
* A binary block code consists of a set of codewords, each of which is a string of 0s and 1s, all the same length. When each pair of codewords has large Hamming distance, it can be used as an error-correcting code. A block code can also be described as a family of sets, by describing each codeword as the set of positions at which it contains a 1.
* A topological space consists of a pair formula_37 where formula_38 is a set (whose elements are called &quot;points&quot;) and formula_39 is a on formula_40 which is a family of sets (whose elements are called &quot;open sets&quot;) over formula_38 that contains both the empty set formula_42 and formula_38 itself, and is closed under arbitrary set unions and finite set intersections.

===Covers and topologies===

A family of sets is said to a set formula_38 if every point of formula_38 belongs to some member of the family. 
A subfamily of a cover of formula_38 that is also a cover of formula_38 is called a . 
A family is called a if every point of formula_38 lies in only finitely many members of the family. If every point of a cover lies in exactly one member of formula_38, the cover is a partition of formula_50

When formula_38 is a topological space, a cover whose members are all open sets is called an . 
A family is called if each point in the space has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many members of the family.
A or is a family that is the union of countably many locally finite families.

A cover formula_30 is said to another (coarser) cover formula_53 if every member of formula_30 is contained in some member of formula_55 A is a particular type of refinement.

==Special types of set families==

A Sperner family is a set family in which none of the sets contains any of the others. Sperner&#x27;s theorem bounds the maximum size of a Sperner family.

A Helly family is a set family such that any minimal subfamily with empty intersection has bounded size. Helly&#x27;s theorem states that convex sets in Euclidean spaces of bounded dimension form Helly families.

An abstract simplicial complex is a set family formula_1 (consisting of finite sets) that is downward closed; that is, every subset of a set in formula_1 is also in formula_58 
A matroid is an abstract simplicial complex with an additional property called the &quot;augmentation property&quot;. 

Every filter is a family of sets.

A convexity space is a set family closed under arbitrary intersections and unions of chains (with respect to the inclusion relation).

Other examples of set families are independence systems, greedoids, antimatroids, and bornological spaces.

<text>Teenage Fanclub are a Scottish alternative rock band formed in Glasgow in 1989. The group were founded by Norman Blake (vocals, guitar), Raymond McGinley (vocals, lead guitar) and Gerard Love (vocals, bass), all of whom shared lead vocals and songwriting duties until Love&#x27;s departure in 2018. As of 2023, the band&#x27;s lineup consists of Blake, McGinley, Francis Macdonald (drums, vocals), Dave McGowan (bass, vocals) and Euros Childs (keyboards, vocals).

In concert the band usually alternate among its songwriters, giving equal playing time to each one&#x27;s songs. Although often pegged as alternative rock, the group have incorporated a wide variety of elements from various music styles.

Teenage Fanclub have had a succession of drummers, namely Francis Macdonald, Brendan O&#x27;Hare and Paul Quinn. Keyboardist Finlay Macdonald (no relation) has also been a member. As of 2023, the band have released 12 studio albums and two compilation albums.

==History==
Teenage Fanclub emerged from the Glasgow C86 scene. They formed following the break-up of The Boy Hairdressers, a band featuring Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake and Francis Macdonald. Following a brief period in which Blake was a member of BMX Bandits, the three former bandmates joined with Gerard Love to form Teenage Fanclub.

Originally a noisy and chaotic band, their first album &quot;A Catholic Education&quot;, released in 1990 on Paperhouse, is largely atypical of their later sound, with the possible exception of &quot;Everything Flows&quot;. Mostly written by Blake and McGinley, the record included several songs originally intended for The Boy Hairdressers. After recording his drum parts, Macdonald left the band to resume his university studies. They re-recorded several songs with Macdonald&#x27;s replacement,
Brendan O&#x27;Hare, because they weren&#x27;t satisfied with the results of the original recording sessions, and because they wanted to involve O&#x27;Hare in the album.

The band followed the album with the EP &quot;God Knows It&#x27;s True&quot; before being signed by Creation Records. &quot;The King&quot;, their next album, was a semi-improvised collection recorded in a single day. Originally intended to be a very limited release, the record received critical reviews of its self-confessed shambolic guitar thrashes and a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.

Their next album, &quot;Bandwagonesque&quot;, released on Creation Records in the UK and Geffen in the US, brought Teenage Fanclub a measure of commercial success. &quot;Bandwagonesque&quot; was more deliberately constructed, the hooks became stronger, the guitar riffs were brought under control, and the harmony vocals took shape. &quot;Bandwagonesque&quot; topped &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1991 end-of-year poll for best album, beating Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, their Creation stablemates My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s album &quot;Loveless&quot;, and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Out of Time&quot;.

The subsequent, &quot;Thirteen&quot;, received mixed reviews on release. Brendan O&#x27;Hare left Teenage Fanclub during this period because of &quot;musical differences&quot;, to be replaced by Paul Quinn (formerly of the Soup Dragons).

&quot;Grand Prix&quot;, Teenage Fanclub&#x27;s fifth album, was both a critical and commercial success in the UK, becoming their first top ten album. In the United States however the band failed to regain the ground that &quot;Thirteen&quot; had lost them. Around this time Liam Gallagher of labelmates Oasis called the band &quot;the second best band in the world&quot; – second only to Oasis.

&quot;Songs from Northern Britain&quot; followed &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and built on the former&#x27;s success. It became their highest-charting release in the UK and contained their biggest hit single to date, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Enough&quot;.

The follow-up album, &quot;Howdy!&quot;, released on Columbia Records in the UK after the demise of Creation, continued the sound of &quot;Songs from Northern Britain&quot;. Francis Macdonald rejoined as the drummer in place of Quinn, who left the band after recording his parts for &quot;Howdy!&quot; and before its release due to personal difficulties within the band . Quinn went on to form The Primary 5.

In 2002, they released &quot;Words of Wisdom and Hope&quot; with Jad Fair of Half Japanese.

Their final release on a Sony label, &quot;Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds – A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub&quot;, collected the Fanclub&#x27;s best songs along with three new songs (one from each member).

Their next album, &quot;Man-Made&quot;, was released on 2 May 2005, on the band&#x27;s own &quot;PeMa&quot; label. &quot;Man-Made&quot; was recorded in Chicago in 2004, and produced by John McEntire of Tortoise.

In 2006, the band held two special concerts (in London and Glasgow) playing their 1991 album &quot;Bandwagonesque&quot; in its entirety.

The band began work on their ninth album in August 2008, booking an initial three weeks at Leeders Farm recording studio in Norfolk. The album was called &quot;Shadows&quot;, the first to involve keyboardist Dave McGowan as a full-time member, and was released on the band&#x27;s own &quot;PeMa&quot; label. It became available in Europe, Australasia and Japan on 31 May 2010, and was released by Merge Records in North America on 8 June 2010.

In May 2015, Teenage Fanclub supported the Foo Fighters at a concert at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

Their tenth album, &quot;Here&quot;, was released on 9 September 2016.

The story of Teenage Fanclub&#x27;s early days features in the 2017 documentary &quot;Teenage Superstars&quot;.

In August 2018, the band issued new versions of their five Creation Records era albums which had been remastered at Abbey Road Studios. To celebrate the reissues, the band also announced Songs from Teenage Fanclub: The Creation Records Years, a four-city UK tour during late October to mid-November in which they would play three nights each in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London, with each night&#x27;s setlist covering different periods of the Creation-era discography, and featuring former drummers Brendan O&#x27;Hare and Paul Quinn participating, in which both drummers would respectively perform the albums and B-sides they had originally recorded. These gigs would be Gerard Love&#x27;s last with the group, as he separated from the band due to differences in opinion on their future touring plans, later revealed to be a reluctance to fly frequently around the world for live performances.

After Love&#x27;s departure, Euros Childs joined the band on keyboards and vocals, with Dave McGowan switching over to bass and vocals. A new album with this line-up, titled &quot;Endless Arcade&quot;, was recorded in early and late 2019. It was originally planned for release in October 2020 to coincide with a UK and Europe tour the following November and December. However, the tour was rescheduled for April and May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the album&#x27;s release date would eventually be set for 5 March 2021. The album release date and tour would end up being rescheduled once again, with &quot;Endless Arcade&quot; coming out on 30 April 2021 and the tour dates postponed to September 2021 and April and May 2022.

On 23 May 2023, Teenage Fanclub announced the September release of their twelfth album &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;.

==Other projects==
Norman Blake formed the two-person band Jonny with Euros Childs. In 2012, Blake also formed a Canadian-based supergroup with Joe Pernice and Mike Belitsky called The New Mendicants.

Raymond McGinley joined Dave McGowan&#x27;s folk group Snowgoose, whose debut album &quot;Harmony Springs&quot; was released in 2012.

After playing bass on Jonny&#x27;s 2011 eponymous debut album, Dave McGowan became Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s touring bassist in 2011, and appeared on their 2015 album &quot;Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance&quot;. On 3 November 2018, he became an official member of the band.

Gerard Love released his solo album &quot;Electric Cables&quot; in 2012 using the alias Lightships. The album also featured instrumental contributions from Dave McGowan and former Teenage Fanclub drummer Brendan O&#x27;Hare.

Francis Macdonald released an album of minimalist classical music, &quot;Music for String Quartet, Piano &amp; Celeste&quot;, in 2015. Macdonald played piano and celeste, with strings by members of the Scottish Ensemble.

Paul Quinn released 3 self composed albums. North Pole on his own Bellbeat Music label. Go! Released on Re-Action Recordings and High 5. Quinn released a digital only release of Demos before deciding to call time on The Primary 5

==Musical style and legacy==
Their sound is reminiscent of Californian bands like the Beach Boys and the Byrds, and their seventies counterparts Big Star. Teenage Fanclub are influenced by Big Star and Orange Juice. They performed a cover of Orange Juice&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot; with Edwyn Collins. In December 2010, at the ATP Bowlie 2 music festival, they performed as the backing band for Edwyn Collins.

Their musical style has been described as alternative rock, power pop, indie rock, indie pop, jangle pop, noise pop, pop-punk, and grunge (early).

Teenage Fanclub were regularly name-checked in interviews by Kurt Cobain, who described them as &quot;the best band in the world&quot;. The band would support Nirvana on tour in the summer of 1992. Juliana Hatfield covered the song &quot;Cells&quot; on her 2012 self-titled album.

<doc id="723048" wikidata="Q1399692" url="?curid=723048" title="Grave goods">
<text>Grave goods, in archaeology and anthropology, are items buried along with a body.

They are usually personal possessions, supplies to smooth the deceased&#x27;s journey into an afterlife, or offerings to gods. Grave goods may be classed by researchers as a type of votive deposit. Most grave goods recovered by archaeologists consist of inorganic objects such as pottery and stone and metal tools, but organic objects that have since decayed were also placed in ancient tombs. If grave goods were to be useful to the deceased in the afterlife, then favorite foods or everyday objects were supplied. Oftentimes, social status played a role in what was left and how often it was left. Funerary art is a broad term but generally means artworks made specifically to decorate a burial place, such as miniature models of possessions - including slaves or servants - for &quot;use&quot; in an afterlife. (Ancient Egypt sometimes saw the burial of real servants with the deceased. Similar cases of human sacrifice of slaves, retainers and wives feature in graves in (for example) the Americas, ancient Germania, and ancient Mesopotamia. Compare suttee.)

Where grave goods appear, grave robbery is a potential problem. Etruscans would scratch the word &quot;śuθina&quot;, Etruscan for &quot;from a tomb&quot;, on grave goods buried with the dead to discourage their reuse by the living. The tomb of pharaoh Tutankhamun is famous because it was one of the few Egyptian tombs that was not thoroughly looted in ancient times.

Grave goods can be regarded as a sacrifice intended for the benefit of the deceased in the afterlife. Closely related are customs of ancestor worship and offerings to the dead, in modern western culture related to All Souls&#x27; Day (Day of the Dead), in East Asia the &quot;hell bank note&quot; and related customs. Also closely related is the custom of retainer sacrifice, where servants or wives of a deceased chieftain are interred with the body. As the inclusion of expensive grave goods and of slaves or retainers became a sign of high status in the Bronze Age, the prohibitive cost led to the development of &quot;fake&quot; grave goods, where artwork meant to &quot;depict&quot; grave goods or retainers is produced for the burial and deposited in the grave in place of the actual sacrifice.

==History==
There are disputed claims of intentional burial of Neanderthals as old as 130,000 years. Similar claims have been made for early anatomically modern humans as old as 100,000 years. The earliest undisputed cases of &quot;homo sapiens &quot;burials are found in Upper Palaeolithic sites.

Burials that include intentional artifacts come much later. There is evidence of Egyptians (of the Badarian culture) being buried with grave goods very early in their prehistory. Examples of these items include pots, shells, combs, stone vessels, animal figurines, and slate palettes.

Beads made of basalt deposited in graves in the Fertile Crescent
date to the end of the Upper Paleolithic, beginning in about the 12th to 11th millennium BC.

The distribution of grave goods are a potential indicator of the social stratification of a society. Thus, early Neolithic graves tend to show equal distribution of goods, suggesting a more or less classless society, while in Chalcolithic and Bronze Age burials, rich grave goods are concentrated in &quot;chieftain&quot; graves (barrows), indicating social stratification. It is also possible that burial goods indicate a level of concern and consciousness in regard to an afterlife and related sense of spirituality. For example, when they buried pharaohs in ancient Egypt, they buried common house hold items, food, vehicles, etc. so they could have a comfortable afterlife.

==Famous grave sites==
The expression of social status in rich graves is taken to extremes in the royal graves of the Bronze Age. In the Theban Necropolis in Ancient Egypt, the pyramids and the royal graves in the Valley of the Kings are among the most elaborate burials in human history. This trend is continued into the Iron Age. An example of an extremely rich royal grave of the Iron Age is the Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang.

In the sphere of the Roman Empire, early Christian graves lack grave goods, and grave goods tend to disappear with the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism in the 5th and 6th centuries. Similarly, the presence of grave goods in the Early Middle Ages in Europe has often been taken as evidence of paganism, although during the period of conversion in Anglo-Saxon England and the Frankish Empire (7th century), the situation may be more complicated.
In the Christian Middle Ages, high-status graves are marked on the exterior, with tomb effigies or expensive tomb stones and still had certain grave goods such as accessories and textiles.

The practice of placing grave goods with the dead body has thus an uninterrupted history beginning in the Upper Paleolithic, if not the Middle Paleolithic. Many people would assume that the introduction of Christianity led to the absence of grave goods, however, there were many different Christian tombs that were shown to still have grave goods such as jewelry.

==Role in archaeology==
The importance of grave goods, from the simple behavioral and technical to the metaphysical, in archaeology cannot be overestimated. Because of their almost ubiquitous presence throughout the world and throughout prehistory, in many cases the excavation of every-day items placed in burials is the main source of such artifacts in a given prehistoric culture.
However, care must be taken to avoid naïve interpretation of grave goods as an objective sample of artifacts in use in a culture. Because of their ritual context, grave goods may represent a special class of artifacts, in some instances produced especially for burial.
Artwork produced for the burial itself is known as funerary art, while grave goods in the narrow sense are items produced for actual use that are placed in the grave, but in practice the two categories overlap.

Grave goods in Bronze Age and Iron Age cemeteries are a good indicator of relative social status; these wealthier graves may have included earrings, necklaces, and exotic foreign materials such as amber. Some even had the spectacular sighting of gold as their grave goods which contrasted from the less wealthy graves which were more deficient. Also,
in a 2001 study on an Iron Age cemetery in Pontecagnano Faiano, Italy, a correlation was found between the quality of grave goods and Forensic indicators on the skeletons, showing that skeletons in wealthy tombs tended to show substantially less evidence of biological stress during adulthood, with fewer broken bones or signs of hard labor.

Along with social status, grave goods also shed light on the societal norms with regards to sex. Common binary societies had women perform duties such as mothering, processing activities, cooking, etc. and men perform duties such as hunting and fighting. These societies would bury their women with jewelry and their men with axes. The Durankulak cemetery on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast had findings to match this society structure. There are societies where the roles are switched. The Sauromatian society&#x27;s women were highly respected warriors. Their graves were full of weapons and horse trappings. When it was difficult to determine sex of the individual due to bone decay, the grave goods became the determining factor.

==In modern times==
Grave goods continue to be important in modern funerary rituals. In contemporary English and American culture, bodies may be buried with goods such as eyewear, jewelry, photographs, and letters. In addition, objects are sometimes left above ground near or on top of gravestones. Flowers are common, although visitation stones are preferred in Jewish culture. In addition, coins for the dead (including challenge coins) are sometimes left on American military graves by comrades of the deceased.

<text>Aracruz is a municipality at the central coast of Espírito Santo, Brazil.

==Geography==
Aracruz covers , and has a population of 103,101 with a population density of 66 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The municipality contains part of the Comboios Biological Reserve, a fully protected area.
The Santa Cruz Wildlife Refuge created in 2010 extends offshore from the municipality.
The coastline of the municipality is also protected in part by the Costa das Algas Environmental Protection Area, created in 2010.

==History==
The municipality&#x27;s history begins in 1556, when two Jesuit priests (Braz Lourenço and Diogo Jácomo) founded Santa Cruz, a town then called Aldeia Nova (&quot;New Village&quot;). Aldeia Nova later became known as Aldeia Velha (Old Village), since it didn&#x27;t prosper as much as its neighbour, which then became known as Aldeia Nova, and is today called Nova Almeida. Aldeia Velha became emancipated as a municipality in 1848, and changed its name to Santa Cruz. In 1943, the municipality and its capital were both renamed Aracruz. However, the biggest economic driver at the time was &quot;jacarandá&quot; wood, and Sauaçu held most of the wood processing plants (&quot;serrarias&quot;), so in 1948 the capital was moved to Sauaçu (also called Sauassu), and the capital&#x27;s name went with it. Sauaçu then became known as Aracruz, and Aracruz reverted to its formal and present name, Santa Cruz.

Santa Cruz was founded at the mouth of the Piraquê-mirim and Piraquê-açu Rivers, as were a number of Amerindian tribes. After a visit from the Emperor Peter II who slept in Santa Cruz in 1860, he signed permission for 386 Italian families to settle in Santa Cruz, and those families founded Fazenda Nova Trento (New Trento Farm) around 1874. Other groups moved up the Piraquê-açu river to found Palmas Farm (&quot;Fazenda das Palmas&quot;) and Santa Teresa. At this time coffee and cassava plantations were common.

Another large wave of Italian immigrants began coming around 1872, when a ship called &quot;Sofia&quot; arrived bringing 386 Italians from the region of Trento. Those went on to found Nova Trento Colony.

On November 25, 2022, a shooting spree occurred at two schools in Aracruz: the Primo Bitti State Elementary and Middle School, a public school; and the Praia de Coqueiral Educational Center, a private school. Four people were killed, and 12 others were injured. The suspect, a 16-year-old former student at the public school, was arrested approximately four hours later.

==Demographics==
According to the IBGE population estimate for 2016, Aracruz is the tenth most populated municipality in Espírito Santo, with 96.746 residents.

==Population==
Aracruz is home to roughly 1,500 Native Americans divided into six reservations: Caieiras Velha, Comboios, Irajá, Pau Brasil, Tekoá and Três Palmeiras. Only in the last couple of decades have they been able to secure their land here, as many problems with the local paper industry greatly prolonged their land struggles. Those Amerindians belong to two tribes: the Tupiniquim and the Guarani. The Native Americans in Aracruz Municipality no longer speak their native languages, but they hold on to their traditional subsistence farming and handcraft trade.
