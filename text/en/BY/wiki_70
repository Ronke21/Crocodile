<text>The Rock Machine Motorcycle Club (RMMC) or Rock Machine is an international outlaw motorcycle club founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1986. It has eighteen Canadian chapters spread across seven provinces. It also has nine chapters in the United States and eleven chapters in Australia, with chapters also located in 24 other countries. It was formed in 1986, by Salvatore Cazzetta and his brother Giovanni Cazzetta. The Rock Machine competed with the Hells Angels for control of the street-level narcotics trade in Quebec. The Quebec Biker War saw the Rock Machine form an alliance with a number of other organizations to face the Hells Angels. The conflict occurred between 1994 and 2002 and resulted in over 160 deaths and over 300 injured. An additional 100+ have been imprisoned.

Common nicknames for the organization include &quot;R.M.&quot;, &quot;Black &amp; Platinum&quot;, &quot;RMMC&quot;, and &quot;1813&quot;. The official Rock Machine club motto is &quot;A La Vie A La Mort&quot;, or &quot;To the Life Until Death&quot;. The club also possesses a patch that reads &quot;RMFFRM&quot; which stands for &quot;Rock Machine Forever, Forever Rock Machine&quot;, an extremely common tradition among outlaw motorcycle clubs.

The Rock Machine Motorcycle Club gained the status of a &quot;Hang-around&quot; club in May 1999 and after eighteen months, became a probationary chapter of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club on 1 December 2000. Bandidos National Officer Edward Winterhalder was put in charge of overseeing the transition by Bandidos International President, George Wegers. The original version of the Rock Machine (1986–1999) in Canada changed their colors from black and platinum to red and gold in May 1999; their colors remained red and gold until they became &quot;Full-Patch&quot; Bandidos on 1 December 2001. In a &quot;patch-over&quot; ceremony at the Rock Machine&#x27;s Kingston chapter clubhouse.

A second version of the Rock Machine was founded in 2008 in Winnipeg under the leadership of Sean &quot;Crazy Dog&quot; Brown, adopting the original black and platinum colors as their patch. The second version has no connection with the first version.

The club&#x27;s racial policy is all-inclusive and possesses members from several different ethnicities including African Canadian/Americans. Despite the group&#x27;s use of the Waffen SS&#x27;s double lightning bolt on one of their patches, it is mainly to show respect to the club&#x27;s historical roots as opposed to the racial meaning of the symbol, due to large numbers of their founding members being a part of the SS Motorcycle Club. It is also worn due to its status in the motorcycle community. It is seen as an outlaw symbol, as society dictates people should not wear it, thus outlaws usually wear it as a sign of rebellion against societal standards as opposed to racial ideology.

Since 2007, the club has spread across Canada and throughout several other countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Hungary, Belgium, New Zealand, Sweden, Serbia, Norway, France, South Africa, England, Spain, Georgia, Hong Kong, Kosovo, Kuwait, Armenia, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and Turkey. As of 2022, the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club has established over 120 chapters on five continents. In the 2000s, the Rock Machine allied themselves with fellow international Canadian motorcycle club the Loners Motorcycle Club.

==The first incarnation==
In approximately 1982, Salvatore Cazzetta was a member of the SS, a white supremacist motorcycle gang based in Pointe-aux-Trembles, on the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal. Fellow SS member Maurice Boucher became friends with Cazzetta and as leaders of the club, the pair became candidates to join the Hells Angels when that club expanded into Canada.

Réjean Lessard, the president of The Sorel chapter of the Hells Angels suspected Laval chapter was interfering with drug profits through personal use of products intended for sale. In the Lennoxville massacre, five members of the Laval chapter were killed. Divers located the decomposing bodies of the victims at the bottom of the St. Lawrence River, wrapped in sleeping bags and tied to weightlifting plates, two months after the party. The event became known as the &quot;Lennoxville massacre,&quot; and its extreme nature earned the Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels a notorious reputation. Cazzetta considered the event an unforgivable breach of the outlaw code and, rather than joining the Hells Angels, in 1986 formed his own club, the Rock Machine, with his brother Giovanni and Paul Porter. The journalist Jerry Langton: &quot;The Cazzettas and Porter recruited a number of street toughs-including a few former Outlaws and guys who had been rejected by the Hells Angels-to form a new group called the Rock Machine. In the beginning they were a gang, but not a motorcycle gang. Of course, the Cazeettas, Porter and a few others rode Harleys, but the vast majority didn&#x27;t&quot;. Cazzetta spoke fluent French, English and Italian and had contacts with the Rizzuto crime family, the West End Gang, and the Dubois Gang. Giovanni Cazzetta would hold the position of second-in-command. Only Salvatore would hold more influence.

Future Rock Machine National President Fred Faucher later said, &quot;Sal once told me, &#x27;Those guys (Hells Angels), they operate their club in such a way that I didn&#x27;t want to join them&#x27;&quot;. The founding members of the Rock Machine were Salvatore Cazzettta, his younger brother Giovanni and Paul &quot;Sasquatch&quot; Porter. Other founding members included, Johnny Plescio, Andrew &quot;Curly&quot; Sauvageau, Renaud Jomphe, Gilles Lambert, Martin Bourget, Richard &quot;Bam Bam&quot; Lagacé, Serge Pinel and several others. The majority of the Rock Machine were former members of the Merciless Riders, the Executeurs and the SS. The Rock Machine made its living via the sale of narcotics and other prohibited goods. As the Rock Machine charged considerably less for cocaine than the Hells Angels, the gang won much market share in the Montreal area. The Hells Angels had been badly weakened by the Lennoxville massacre, which to the convictions of a number of Hells Angels in the late 1980s. Initially Rock Machine members chose not to wear Hells Angels-style leather vests that could easily identify members, and instead wore rings displaying an eagle insignia (this would last until 1995, with the adoption of three-piece vests).

The official Rock Machine club motto is &quot;A La Vie A La Mort&quot;, or &quot;To the Life Until Death&quot;. The club the possesses a patch that reads &quot;RMFFRM&quot; which stands for &quot;Rock Machine Forever, Forever Rock Machine&quot;, an extremely common thing among outlaw motorcycle clubs.

In April 1992, Giovanni Cazzetta was arrested by police and charged with trafficking narcotics, police found him to be in position of three kilograms of cocaine worth around $120,000 (modern equivalent when adjusting for inflation of $246,000 US). He was forced to plead guilty to four charges the following spring and was sentenced to four years in prison. Giovanni was released in 1997 and briefly participated in the conflict that was to come. Marice Boucher, was released after finishing a forty-month sentence for armed sexual assault, joined the Hells Angels and was subsequently promoted within the club&#x27;s ranks. The Hells Angels and Rock Machine co-existed peacefully for many years, a situation that, according to police officials, was due to Boucher&#x27;s respect for his friend, Cazzetta and the latter&#x27;s connections with the Quebec Mafia, the only organized crime group that the motorcycle gangs were unwilling to attack.

==Quebec Biker war==

Founder of the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club, Salvatore Cazzetta was arrested at a pitbull farm located in Fort Erie, Ontario during 1994. He was charged with attempting to import more than eleven tons (22,000lbs) of cocaine valued at an estimated 275 million dollars US (adjusting for inflation the 2021 value is $513,238,697). Claude Vézina, who was president of the Quebec City chapter at the time, became the new National President of the Rock Machine. Renaud Jomphe was made president of the Montreal chapter, while Marcel Demers became the president of the Quebec City chapter until eventually opening the Beauport chapter in late 1996.

Recently promoted Hells Angels Montreal President Boucher began to increase pressure on the Rock Machine shortly after the arrest, which initiated the Quebec Biker war. The local Rock Machine Motorcycle Club formed an affiliation, the Alliance, with Montreal crime families such as the Pelletier Clan, Dark Circle and other independent dealers who wished to resist the Hells Angels&#x27; attempts to establish a monopoly on street-level drug trade in the city. A violent turf war ensued with the Hells Angels. The Rock Machine MC, its support clubs and the Pelletier Clan would provide manpower while the Dark Circle would provide the funding. The Dark Circle&#x27;s leadership was ruled by a committee of five. The chairman was Michel Duclos.

Boucher organized &quot;puppet clubs&quot; to persuade Rock Machine-controlled bars and their resident drug dealers to surrender their illegal drug business. This led to the creation of the Palmers MC, a Rock Machine MC support club with chapters in Montreal and Quebec City. It was created to counter Hell&#x27;s Angels allies, the Rockers MC, Evil ones and Death Riders MC support clubs. It was led and organized by Rock Machine members Jean &quot;Le Francais&quot; Duquaire and André &quot;Dédé&quot; Désormeaux, who was initially a member of the Dark Circle but joined the Rock Machine. These two were described as the grandfathers of the Palmers MC, all of whose members would be patched into the Rock Machine in 2000. The starting point of the conflict is disputed; however, on 13 July 1994, three members of the Rock Machine entered a business in downtown Montreal. They assassinated Pierre Daoust, a member of a Hells Angel support club, the Death Riders Motorcycle Club. Once it was confirmed they had the right target, he was shot 16 times in the head and torso.

There was very little coverage oveofr this incident, but many in Montreal&#x27;s underground knew that the Rock Machine was defending its territory, months before the death of Daoust. The members of the Alliance (Rock Machine MC, Pelletier Clan, the Dark Circle) as well as other individual narcotics dealers and street gangs met to discuss a united front against the Hells Angels after they gave the narcotics community of Quebec an ultimatum to have them as their mandatory supplier of all contraband goods and narcotics. This offer was refused and the Alliance was formed; due to the Hells Angels&#x27; &quot;monopolistic attitude&quot;, they had decided to take the initiative and strike first.

A day after on 14 July 1994, The Rock Machine attempted to assassinate Normand Robitaille, a member of Hells Angels support club the Rockers MC and a future and prominent member of the Hells Angels. The attempt failed and Quebec police announced that they had arrested five members of the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club for planning to bomb the Evil Ones MC clubhouse which was also aligned with the Hells Angels.

With current knowledge of events due to information from Sylvain Boulanger, it is known that on 15 July 1994, the hierarchy of the Hells Angels in Quebec held emergency meetings in the city of Longueuil, Quebec. All four chapters in Quebec at the time were present (Montreal, Quebec City, Trois-Rivières and Sherbrooke). There was also a meeting at Hells Angels bunker during this period of time. All chapters had to vote on whether they would participate in the conflict against the Rock Machine and their alliance. All four chapters agreed and the club began to prepare for the long conflict ahead. The Hells Angels was an international organization and received aid from all over the country and internationally, giving them more support than the Rock Machine.

On 19 October 1994, a local drug dealer Maurice Lavoie was gunned down in his car and his girlfriend was wounded. Lavoie had previously been buying his wares from the Pelletier Clan associated with the Rock Machine, but had recently switched to the Hells Angels, and as a result the Pelletier Clan hired a hitman named Patrick Call to kill Lavoie.

On 28 October 1994, Sylvain Pelletier, the leader of the Pelletier Clan, was killed by the Hells Angels, who threatened to murder any drug dealer who did not buy their supplies from them. After these killings, an increasingly murderous struggle for the control of the drug trade in Montreal began between the Hells Angels and the Rock Machine that would see 20 dead before the end of 1994.

After Pelletier was killed, the independent drug dealers of Montreal formed the &quot;Alliance to fight the Angels&quot; headed by his younger brother, Harold Pelletier, whose first act was an attempt to assassinate Boucher in November 1994. Another member of the Pelletier Clan, Martin Simard, purchased enough stolen dynamite to fill a truck, which was left near Boucher&#x27;s favorite restaurant by Alliance member Martin Pellerin. The plan was to set off the explosives by remote control when Boucher arrived, killing him and everybody else in the restaurant, but a Montreal parking officer noticed the truck was parked illegally and had it towed, thus unknowingly foiling the plot.

On 24 June 1995, Boucher founded the Nomads, an elite chapter of the Angels, that unlike the other chapters, had no geographical limit and were to operate all over Canada. To join the Nomads, applicants were required to commit murders, which ensured that no undercover police agents could enter the Nomads chapter. Additionally, only the highest-quality Angels who had proven themselves could join the Nomads.

On 13 August 1995, a Jeep wired with a remote-controlled bomb exploded, killing Hells Angels associate Marc Dube and an 11-year-old boy, Daniel Desrochers, who was playing in a nearby schoolyard, An Interpol informant claimed that the plan was created and facilitated by Boucher to earn back public credit. The first full-patch Hells Angels member was shot to death entering his car at a shopping mall a month later. Nine bombs went off around the province during his funeral, targeting several Hells Angels businesses and properties. This series of violence related to Operation Wolverine, a police crackdown on both groups in which 130 were arrested.

in October 1995, Harold Pelletier, one of the heads of the Pelletier Clan (member of the Alliance), turned himself in to the &quot;Sûreté du Québec&quot;, confessing that on the night of 7 August 1983, he had murdered a drug dealer named Michel Beaulieu who was behind in his payments to the Pelletier Clan. He asked that the police provide him with protection from the Angels in exchange for more information about his crimes.

Ultimately, Pelletier confessed to committing 17 murders between 1983 and 1995, yet he was convicted only of the murder of Beaulieu. His murder of Beaulieu was classified as second degree murder, despite the fact Beaulieu had fallen asleep after Pelletier got him drunk before he was shot. Since the murder was premeditated, it should have been classified as a first degree murder.

Steinert was the biggest pimp in Montreal, owning the Sensations escort service, whose office in Montreal was destroyed in a case of arson in August 1996 by the Rock Machine.

In his plea bargain struck in June 1996, Pelletier was sentenced to life imprisonment with a promise that he receive full parole after 10 years served, in exchange for which he shared all he knew about the Montreal underworld. The Crown justified the plea bargain with Pelletier, given that he was guilty of 17 murders, on the grounds he was a &quot;mine of information&quot; about the underworld of Montreal. Pelletier&#x27;s motives for striking a plea bargain was that the &quot;Alliance against the Angels&quot; was collapsing with Alliance members defecting over to the Angels, and he wanted Crown protection from the Angels. However, Pelletier violated the terms of his plea bargain, under which he promised not to commit any more crimes, when he was caught in 2002 attempting to bribe another prison inmate to kill a prisoner whom he disliked, allowing the Crown to revoke its agreement. Pelletier was not released in June 2006, as had been promised 10 years earlier. He finally received full parole in December 2013 after he completed his high school equivalency degree, started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and demonstrated an ability to get along with penitentiary staff.

On 18 October 1996. president of the Rock Machine Montreal chapter, Renaud Jomphe, was shot and killed. He was seated with fellow club members Christian Deschenes and Raymond Laureau in a booth at the rear of a Chinese restaurant known as Restaurant Kim Hoa, located on Wellington Street. A man entered the establishment, approached the table, fired several shots, and fled out the rear of the building. Jomphe and Deschenes were killed, while Laureau was wounded in the shoulder. One of the Paradis brothers, Peter Paradis, would succeed Jomphe as president of the Montreal chapter, taking over much of his business in the suburb of Verdun.

In November 1996, the Rock Machine planted a bomb in the old Hells Angels bunker in St. Nicholas and the residential neighborhood where it was located was shaken by the immense force of the blast. The bunker received significant damage.

On 28 March 1997, Rocker member Aimé Simard, stating he was acting under the orders of the Rocker president, a man known as Gregory &quot;Pissaro&quot; Wooley, murdered Rock Machine member Jean-Marc Caissy as he entered a Montreal arena to play hockey with his friends.

In early 1997, Giovanni Cazzetta was released from prison and returned to the Rock Machine. Claude Vézina willingly stepped down and Giovanni was given the position of national president in his brother&#x27;s absence. He would lead the club through the conflict until May 1997. In May, Giovanni was subject to a police sting in which a man from Alberta attempted to purchase 15 kilos of cocaine (valued at $600,000; adjusting for inflation, the modern equivalent of $1,132,000). This individual turned out to be an informant for the crown. The mules Frank Bonneville and Donald Waite, who delivered the cocaine to the informant, were arrested and the narcotics were seized by police, Matticks, Bonneville and Waite pleaded guilty on 17 June 1997, and were sentenced to three, four, and two years respectively. Claude Vézina was momentarily reinstated as national president of the Rock Machine. Giovanni attempted to fight the charges brought against him, but he lost these appeals and was sentenced to five years prison time in April 1998. Maria Cazzetta, Giovanni&#x27;s sister, and Suzanne Poudrier received one year conditional sentences.

On 19 May 1997, Prominent Rock Machine member Serge Cyr was placed under arrest and charged with conspiracy along with 13 others including members of the Rock Machine, Pelletier Clan and Palmers MC for planning the murder of Hells Angels president Maurice &quot;Mom&quot; Boucher. In 1994, a stolen van loaded with explosives was discovered outside the Cri-Cri restaurant on St. Catherine Street, the restaurant was an establishment where Boucher often ate. Cyr was released soon after, with the condition that he report to police once a week, which he never did. Cyr gained a reputation from this, and after the December 2000 arrests, he was promoted to president of the Montreal chapter.

On 21 May 1997, Claude Vézina and his sergeant-at-arms Dany &quot;Le Gros&quot; Légaré were both charged with the trafficking of narcotics. In order to conduct his arrest, police had to sneak by guard dogs that he had located on his property; they entered his home and arrested him in his bedroom. This was all the result of a sting operation set up by the Quebec police. A police informant had completed seven transactions of narcotics with the two members of Rock Machine, during a five-month period. The massive raid launched by authorities as part of Operation Carcajou resulted in the seizure of a laboratory where narcotics such as PCP and methamphetamine were produced. $1,500,000 worth of various other narcotics, over 325 kg (716.5 lbs) of dynamite along with detonators, seven pistols, two fully automatic machine guns, three semi-automatic carbines and a pistol suppressor. After the arrest of Vézina, Frédéric Faucher became the Rock Machine&#x27;s new national president on 11 September 1997, Alain &quot;Red Tomato&quot; Brunette was promoted to president of the Quebec City chapter.

In mid-1997, an imprisoned Hells Angel, Denis Houle, was the victim of an unsuccessful assassination attempt when a Rock Machine member opened fire on him from beyond the prison fence. The resulting investigation first alerted the public to the existence of the Dark Circle, and it was reported that the Hells Angels would pay well for information identifying the members of the Dark Circle. Over the next two years, two members of the Dark Circle were murdered by the Hells Angels while a third escaped when the Hells Angels shot and killed the wrong Serge.

As the war turned into a battle of attrition the Hells Angels began to gain the upper hand as ever-increasing levels of support poured in from around Canada and internationally, but at the same time, the Great Nordic Biker War was taking place, and the Rock Machine was impressed with the way that the Scandinavian branches of the Bandidos held their own against the Scandinavian branches of the Hells Angels. In June 1997, the three leaders of the Rock Machine, Fred Faucher, Johnny Plescio, and Robert &quot;Tout Tout&quot; Léger, went to Stockholm to seek support from the Swedish branch of the Bandidos, but were expelled by the Swedish police, who declared that they did not want Canadian bikers in their country.

Faucher, had been the President of the Rock Machine Quebec City chapter prior to his promotion to National President, he had gained wide attention in underworld circles by blowing up the Hells Angels clubhouse in Quebec City in February 1997 and after the Rock Machine&#x27;s leader Claude &quot;Ti-Loup&quot; Vézina was arrested for drug smuggling, he became the Rock Machine&#x27;s new leader on 11 September 1997. 

On 23 August 1998, a team of Rock Machine killers consisting of Frédéric Faucher, Gerald Gallant, and Marcel Demers rode by on their motorcycles and gunned down Paolo Cotroni in his driveway. Cotroni was killed partly to gain the favor of the Rizzutos and partly because he was a friend of Boucher.

On 8 September 1998, Johnny Plescio, a founding member of the Rock Machine, was at his Laval home watching television when his cable was severed. As he rose to see what was wrong with his television, 27 bullets went through Plescios&#x27;s living room window, 16 of which struck him. At Plescio&#x27;s funeral, a flower arrangement appeared bearing the word Bandidos, which was the first sign that the Bandidos Motorcycle Club of Texas was taking an interest in the Rock Machine.

On 28 October 1998. Police arrested 25 Rock Machine members and associates as they were eating dinner in the restaurant of a downtown hotel. The men were forced to lie facedown on the ground, they were searched, and then placed under arrest. Richard Lagacé and Denis Belleau were among those arrested. Many were freed the next day, after swearing to stay away from the others who were picked up by police.

Disaster struck the Dark Circle when one of their number, Salvatore Brunnettii, a restaurateur, bar owner and drug dealer, defected to the Hells Angels and gave them a list of the remaining members of the Dark Circle. This basically led to their collapse, leaving the Rock Machine and fragmented members of the &quot;Alliance&quot; to face the Hells Angels and their support clubs.

By 1999 the Rock Machine MC were seriously looking to align itself with longtime Hells Angels rivals the Bandidos Motorcycle Club as the other factions in the Alliance had been devastated, with the Rock Machine itself receiving substantial losses. In May 1999 the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club became a &quot;hang-around&quot; club for the Bandidos.

On 17 April 2000, Normand Hamel, one of the Nomads, was killed when attempting to flee from Rock Machine assassins in a Laval parking lot while he and his wife were taking his son to the doctor. He was the most senior member of the Hells Angels killed during the conflict. On 12 May 2000, the Angels tried to kill the two Rock Machine members, Tony Duguay and Denis Boucher, suspected of killing Hamel, leading to a wild car crash, during which Duguay took bullet wounds to his arms, right hand, and thigh. About forty police officers from the Carcajou squad raided the Rock Machine chapter in Beauport but found nothing worthwhile. In June 2000, the Rock Machine set up in Ontario began recruiting former members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club.

In July 2000, Boucher&#x27;s plans to set up an internet company were derailed when Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Savard, the loan shark who charged 52% interest on the loans he made to the desperate and needy, was gunned down at the Déjeuners Eggstra! restaurant in the north end of Montreal. Savard had been a Hells Angels associate for several years and was considered a right-hand man for Boucher. Savard&#x27;s dinner companion, Normand Descoteaux, a hockey player turned loan shark, was also a target, but he survived by grabbing a waitress, Hélène Brunet, and using her as an involuntary human shield, ensuring that she took four bullets meant for him. Despite the fact that Brunet took bullets in her arms, legs and shin, Descoteaux was not charged. The shooter&#x27;s were infamous Canadian hitman, Gerald Gallant and an unidentified associate of his. Gallant was employed by Michel Duclos, the leader of the Dark Circle, and also frequently carried out contracts for the Rock Machine during the conflict with the Hells Angels, from 1980 to 2003, he was responsible for 28 murders and 13 attempted murders. His most active years were during the Quebec Biker War, where he killed two members of Hells Angels support clubs in 1997; a third survived an assassination attempt. In 1998 he eliminated five men, including Paul Cotroni Jr., son of deposed mob boss Frank Cotroni, making this his most prominent year as a hitman. He also at times worked for the Irish-Canadian West End Gang.

During this period both groups started to expand into Ontario, with both opening several clubhouses. The Rock Machine opened three chapters in Ontario (Toronto, Kingston and Niagara Falls). The Loners had aligned themselves with the Rock Machine, holding a party in Toronto in June 2000 that was attended by dozens of &quot;machinists&quot;, as the Rock Machine are known in outlaw biker circles. Also in June 2000 before the Hells Angels. Not wanting to lose ground to the Rock Machine in the province, Hells Angels opened its first clubhouse and in 2000, and gave a limited time offer to outlaw motorcycle clubs in Ontario (especially Satan&#x27;s Choice and the Para-Dice Riders). There would be no probationary period for Hells Angels club membership and all members would receive full-patch. This resulted in 168 members of the Para-Dice Riders, Satan&#x27;s Choice, Lobos and Last Chance &quot;patching&quot; to the Angels. Overnight the Hells Angels went from one chapter in Ontario to 14, giving them a massive advantage in the province. This gave the Hells Angels 29 chapters in total, with 418 full-patch members in Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.

On 6 December 2000, 255 police officers tracked and arrested 16 Rock Machine members and associates on narcotics trafficking charges. The &quot;ring&quot;, operated by Marcel Demers Leader of the Beauport chapter and National President Fred Faucher of the Quebec City chapter, were accused of distributing more than two kilograms of cocaine a month and generated almost $5 million in profits annually (the modern equivalent of $8,347,967). Alain Brunette was promoted to the position of national president, until he became the first president of Bandidos Canada on 1 December 2001. Jean-Claude Belanger replaced Brunette as president of the Quebec City chapter. Robert Léger would head the Beauport chapter until his death. Also in December 2000, the Rock Machine officially became a probationary club of the Bandidos. Seeing the division this caused, the Hells Angels approached the Alliance with the offer of a ceasefire brokered by the Rizzuto crime family, which was accepted. The truce had an ulterior motive for the Hells Angels, as they hoped to halt the expansion of the Bandidos in Canada, especially Ontario. The Hells Angels also convinced members of the Rock Machine who did not agree with the &quot;patch-over&quot; to join them. The truce lasted for only a brief period before hostilities continued.

In December 2000, most of the Rock Machine&#x27;s Ontario members joined the Hells Angels. The Hells Angels national president, Walter Stadnick, offered Hells Angels membership to the Rock Machine&#x27;s Kingston and Toronto chapters while excluding the London chapter, saying that the members of the London chapter were unqualified to be Hells Angels. Most of the Ontario members of the Rock Machine took up Stadnick&#x27;s offer as it was felt that the Bandidos patch with its cartoonish drawing of a Mexican bandit was &quot;silly&quot;. Furthermore, Stadnick offered Hells Angels membership on a &quot;patch-for-patch&quot; basis, allowing members to trade their current patches for equivalent Hells Angels, while the Bandidos required new members to take a reduction in rank. Paul &quot;Sasquatch&quot; Porter, a founding member of the Rock Machine and the president of their Kingston chapter, wrote on the wall of the clubhouse: &quot;Hello to all the RMMC, I wish you the best with your new colors! Bye my brothers!&quot; Porter became the president of the Hells Angels&#x27; new Ottawa chapter. The fact that the Hells Angels had conspired to kill Porter when he was a member of the Rock Machine did not stop him from defecting.

Regardless of the prior issues, on 1 December 2001, the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club became official members of the Bandidos Canada in a &quot;patch-over&quot; ceremony at the Rock Machine&#x27;s Kingston chapter club house. The Bandidos Canada inherited seven new chapters (Montreal, Quebec City, Point-Aux-Trembles, Beauport, Toronto, Kingston and Niagara Falls). On 28 March of the same year, a massive investigation by Canadian authorities dubbed Operation Springtime was launched against the Hells Angels. The raids resulted in the arrests of 138 members of the Hells Angels, including Maurice Boucher himself and associates connected with the motorcycle club. This brought about a power vacuum in the country&#x27;s narcotics market.

The Bandidos Canada were looking to take advantage of this opportunity to regain territory lost and take new territory from the Hells Angels. However, a concurrent investigation, Operation Amigo, was underway targeting the Bandidos Canada operations. This operation had initially gone under a different title and was created to target the Rock Machine as a result of the conflict in Quebec. When The Rock Machine patched over to the Bandidos they became the main focus. On 5 June 2002, raids led to the arrests of 62 members of the Bandidos Canada (Rock Machine) including all of its Quebec manpower and many other associates. This put an end to the conflict as it was the first time since the start of the war that both sides had large numbers of men and their respective leaders in custody and facing charges. All in all it is the deadliest recorded biker conflict in history, with over 162 dead, over 300 wounded, 100 plus arrested and 20 people missing. It cost the government of Canada and Quebec millions of dollars in damages, with 84 bombings and 130 cases of arson.

==Second incarnation==
In 2007, the former Winnipeg chapter of the Bandidos renamed themselves the Rock Machine. After the first president of the Winnipeg Bandido chapter, Michael Sandham, was arrested in June 2006, he was replaced as president by Ron Burling, who became the driving force behind the new Rock Machine. The second version of the Rock Machine has no connection with the first version, and just uses the name and the same patch. The website of the second version of the Rock Machine has a &quot;gone, but not forgotten&quot; section devoted to murdered members that failed to list a single Rock Machine biker killed during the Quebec Biker War, but listed the eight Bandidos killed in the Shedden Massacre.

Typical of the members of the Rock Machine was the president of the Winnipeg chapter, Ron Burling, described by the journalist Jerry Langton as a man with a shaven head, bushy goatee beard, his entire body covered in tattoos except for his face, and &quot;physically huge&quot;. Burling&#x27;s Facebook profile described him as &quot;a member of the Rock Machine Nomads&quot; and his occupation as &quot;Edmonton Maximum Security Penitentiary General Population&quot;. He had been convicted of a brazen kidnapping and assault in Toronto. On 8 February 2005, as a member of the Bandidos, Burling smashed through the window of a car to yank out a drug dealer named Adam Amundsen. Burling then beat Amundsen for several hours with a baseball bat and his fists to encourage him to pay a $6,000 drug debt owned to the Bandidos. Burling was convicted of assault and kidnapping, and threatened both the judge and the crown attorneys with violence when his appeal was quashed. Burling tried to lift the bench to throw at somebody, but was tasered by the court marshals. Burling was one of the founding members of the new Rock Machine in 2008. Langton mocked the claims that the second Rock Machine had no connections with criminality, noting that Burling had joined the Rock Machine while he was in prison for assault. Most of the chapters of the second Rock Machine exist only on the internet. One policeman told Langton about the Rock Machine: &quot;Internet bikers? LOL!&quot;

On 19 September 2008, two Australian men with criminal records, Michael Xanthoudakis and Eneliko Sabine, were arrested at Winnipeg airport, and it was revealed that the duo had gone to Winnipeg to join the Rock Machine. On 1 October 2008, the Rock Machine officially announced its existence to the media. The spokesman for the Rock Machine claimed it had 75 members, but none in Quebec &quot;out of respect for the Hells Angels&quot;. The Quebec biker war had made the name Rock Machine well known and a chapter had founded in Australia. The claims of the Rock Machine to have a chapter in Daytona Beach, Florida seems to have no foundation in reality. The party that was supposed to announce the new Rock Machine was attended by only three people. The headquarters of the new Rock Machine is Winnipeg, not Montreal. On 3 June 2009, Jean Paul Beaumont, the sergeant-at-arms of the Winnipeg chapter was arrested for having two assault rifles in his house. On 1 December 2009, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police launched Project Divide and arrested 34 people who were all Hells Angels or Zig Zag Crew members. The arrests allowed the Rock Machine to fill the vacuum and the a puppet gang, the Vendettas MC, was founded in early 2010. The brutal way that the Winnipeg Hells Angels chapter operated had a number of enemies who all joined the Winnipeg chapter of the Rock Machine such as Gregg Hannibal and Billy Bowden, a former Hells Angel.

In March 2010, the Winnipeg police bugged a warehouse on Sargent Avenue which turned to be used by the Rock Machine to sell cocaine. Ronald King of the Rock Machine was arrested and found to be carrying $463, 000 in cash on him. In September 2010, a major division in the Rock Machine emerged about whatever the group should try to open a chapter in Montreal. Jamie &quot;J.C.&quot; Korne, the vice president of the Winnipeg chapter was against opening a chapter in Montreal under the grounds that it was too dangerous, which led to his expulsion on 2 September 2010. Sean &quot;Dog&quot; Brown, the national president of the Rock Machine was deposed in November 2010 over the question of the Montreal chapter and was replaced by Joseph &quot;Critical J&quot; Strachan, who at the age of 40 still lived at home with his parents. On 15 December 2010, Andrew Block, a Rock Machine biker, was murdered in Edmonton.

On 22 March 2011, a Rock Machine biker, Ashley Sandison, contracted his estranged wife despite a restraining order forbidding him from contacting her, which led a shoot-out with the police who had arrived at the house of Mrs. Sandison. On 29 June 2011, the home of Strachan&#x27;s parents in Winnipeg were destroyed in a case of arson after Molotov cocktail was tossed into the house. On 10 July 2011, a business associated with the Hells Angels and the home of a Redlined Support Crew (Hells Angels puppet gang) were burned down. On 12 July 2011, the house of a Redlined Support Crew member was shot up and a 14-year-old boy was wounded. On 9 August 2011, the police arrested two members of the Vendettas, Guy Stevenson and Joseph Choken, for attempting to kill a Hells Angel associate. On 11 August 2011, the home of another Redlined Support Crew member was burned down in a case of arson. On 12 August 2011, the tattoo shop owned by Wayne Nuytten, a Hells Angels associate was burned down in another case of arson. Two Rock Machine members, Taylor Morrision and Shaine Stodgell, were convicted of the arson attacks.

Chevy Ballentyne, a Winnipeg drug dealer who once worked for the Manitoba Warriors and had been convicted of the murder of Guy Poliout, was arrested for a vicious stabbing spree on 23 December 2009. Once Ballentyne was convicted of assault on 17 August 2011, it was revealed that he was a Rock Machine member. On 2 February 2012, the police launched Operation Deplete, which to the seizure of 6, 912 grams of cocaine, 465 grams of crack cocaine, 272 grams of methamphetamine, 9, 811 Ecstasy pills and 501 tablets of oxycodone. Arrested were two Rock Machine members, Billy Bowden and Joshua Lyons. On 14 October 2012, Beaumont was murdered in prison. On 30 January 2013, the Rock Machine national president Strachan was arrested at his parents house on charges of drug trafficking. Also arrested were Rock Machine &quot;full patch&quot; members Todd Murray, John Curwin, and Cameron Hemminger along with the &quot;prospects&#x27; Donny Syraxa, Danny Tran, Patrcik La, Chris Camara, Tegveer Sinh Gill an Richard Lund. The police seized 16 pounds of cocaine along with six guns, two pipe bombs and ammunition. In a plea bargain with the Crown on 13 June 2013, Strahan made guilty pleas to the charges of drug trafficking and gangsterism.

===Allies===
*Outlaws Motorcycle Club - The Outlaws motorcycle club had initially given minor support to the Rock Machine during the Quebec Biker War, The Outlaws were also fighting a conflict with the Hell&#x27;s Angels during this period. An official alliance would be formed between the resurrected Rock Machine and the Outlaws in Manitoba in 2011.
*Gremium Motorcycle Club - During the club&#x27;s expansion into Europe, it made an alliance with Gremium MC, one of the largest motorcycle clubs in Germany.
*Loners Motorcycle Club - A fellow Canadian-based international motorcycle club, an alliance between the two was established in the 2010s.
*Vendettas Motorcycle Club - A RMMC created support club that was founded in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Serves as an international support club for the Rock Machine with chapters in Canada, Australia and Russia.
*Manitoba Warriors - A Native-Canadian gang based in the Canada&#x27;s prairies, an alliance was formed between the two groups during Rock Machine&#x27;s expansion into Western Canada in 2008.
*Bandidos (formerly, 1999–2006) - The Rock Machine became a chapter of the Bandidos in mid-1999. After 18 months, they became an official probationary club. All members of the Rock Machine were patched into the Bandidos on 6 January 2001. They would remain as a single entity until the events of the Shedden Massacre and the subsequent closure of the Bandidos MC Canada. The Rock Machine was reestablished by former Bandidos, and disgruntled members of the Mongols Motorcycle Club.

===Rivals===
*Hells Angels (1986–2002) - The Hells Angels&#x27; actions during the Lennoxville massacre directly led to the creation of the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club itself. Despite this, the two clubs existed in relative harmony until the 1994 arrest of Rock Machine President, Salvatore Cazzetta. From 1994 to 2002, the Rock Machine and the Hells Angels engaged in the deadliest motorcycle conflict in history. This cemented their rivalry. There have been several sporadic incidents since then.
*Rebels Motorcycle Club - The rivalry between the Rock Machine and the Rebels Motorcycle Club started when the Canadian club expanded into Australia. This saw the beginning of the Rock Machine-Rebels conflict.
*Red Devils Motorcycle Club - the Red Devils are the official support club of the Hells Angels, they have had several incidents with the Rock Machine.
*Bandidos Motorcycle Club (2011–present) - Tensions between the Bandidos and Rock Machine started in the mid-2000s, with the Shedden Massacre and the dissolution of the Bandidos Canada driving a wedge between the reemerging Rock Machine and their former ally. The rivalry escalated into conflict in 2011, when the two clubs clashed for control of the German city of Ulm. There has since been several conflicts fought between the two groups in multiple countries.
*WolfSSChanze Faction - a splinter faction of the Rock Machine led by Suat Erköse. The faction changed their emblem in 2022.

===Meeting with the Pagans===
For decades the Pagans Motorcycle Club had looked north to Canada for possibility of expansion. It also found the idea of supporting Hells Angels rivals beneficial. The Rock Machine Motorcycle Club, a Canadian-based international motorcycle club with chapters all over the world, has fought several conflicts with the Hells Angels including the Quebec Biker War, the deadliest motorcycle conflict in history. The Pagans deeply respected these feats and sought to establish a relationship with the Rock Machine. In 2011, dozens of the Pagans traveled to the Canadian province of New Brunswick to meet with the several chapters of the Rock Machine and other locals. At the time New Brunswick was a Canadian province that had little outlaw motorcycle influence. The meeting was to consolidate a friendship and probe the province for expansion. However, in 2018, Pagans member, Andrew &quot;Chef&quot; Glick revealed that the group had abandoned its plans at expansion North, they cited Canada&#x27;s anti-biker laws but also a large part of the reason was that Canadian Hells Angels are considered particularly violent members of the outlaw biker – or &quot;one percenter&quot; – community, Glick said in an interview.

&quot;In Canada and Australia, that&#x27;s where the heaviest (toughest) one per centers are,&quot; Glick said. &quot;Being a one per center in Canada, I would say is a little more dangerous than being a one per center in the U.S.&quot; New Jersey bikers are tough, but &quot;not near as violent as what I&#x27;ve seen and read (about) in Montreal and Toronto.&quot;

==Membership==
Today the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club&#x27;s membership is open to anyone but not to everyone. 
===Earning membership and rules===
Like most other Outlaw motorcycle clubs, members must own and operate a North American or British-made motorcycle with an engine of at least 1000cc and have sufficient riding skills not to be a danger to themselves or others.
In order to become a Rock Machine prospect the rules are strict. All candidates undergo an extensive background check, must have the right set of personal qualities &amp; prove their loyalty to the club.

===Past members===
Former members of the club included Salvatore Cazzetta, Giovanni Cazzetta, Claude Vézina, Paul Porter, Andrew Sauvageau, Marcel Demers, Richard &quot;Bam-Bam&quot; Lagacé, Johnny Plescio, Tony Plescio, Renaud Jomphe (the former president of the Montreal chapter), Martin Bourget, Serge Pinel, Frédéric Faucher, Alain Brunette (who would become the first national president of the Canadian Bandidos in 2001), Jean Paul Beaumont, and Peter Paradis (who became its first member to turn crown&#x27;s evidence).

The Rock Machine was merged with the Bandidos Motorcycle Club on 6 January 2001, in a patch-over ceremony located at the Rock Machine&#x27;s Kingston chapter clubhouse. It was overseen by high-ranking Bandidos member Edward Winterhalder. They remained Bandidos for seven years. Around ten Rock Machine members at the time joined their former arch-enemy, the Hells Angels, due to the Bandidos refusal to grant full members status to &quot;Full-Patch&quot; members of the Rock Machine forcing them to become probationary members of the Bandidos and take a reduction in ranking, this angered some members along with abandoning the Rock machine namesake for a Texas-based entity, it was felt by some that the Bandidos patch with its cartoonish drawing of a Mexican bandit was &quot;silly&quot;. Furthermore, Stadnick offered Hells Angels membership on a &quot;patch-for-patch&quot; basis, allowing members to trade their current patches for equivalent Hells Angels. Many Rock Machine had gained respect from the Hells Angels that they had faced during the conflict and saw them as a better alternative.

Notable members who defected to the Angels included original members Paul Porter and Andrew Sauvageau. &quot;Full-Patch&quot; members Gilles Lambert, Nelson Fernandes, Bruce Doran (who founded the Kingston chapter), and Fred Faucher&#x27;s brother Jean Judes Faucher. Fernandes would die of cancer within months of becoming a Hells Angel. Upon his release, club founder Salvatore Cazzetta joined Hells Angels in 2005, as the Rock Machine had merged with the Bandidos and was no longer active at the time.

==Chapters worldwide==
The club has more than 90 active chapters worldwide.

==Criminal allegations and incidents==

Since its rebirth, the Rock Machine maintains that it is a group of motorcycle enthusiasts and claim that it now dismisses members who are involved in known crimes or criminal activity. Any members that do commit crimes, do so without the club&#x27;s permission. Many law enforcement agencies and journalists criticize these claims.

<text>Assonet ( ) is one of two villages in the town of Freetown in Bristol County, Massachusetts, United States. An original part of the town, Assonet was settled in 1659 along with the city of Fall River, then a part of Freetown. It rests on the banks of the Assonet River. As of the 2000 census, the village had a total population of 4,084; up from 3,614 in 1990. As of the 2014 census, the village had a total estimated population of 9,093.

==History==

Assonet was first settled in 1659, shortly after the completion of Ye Freemen&#x27;s Purchase. It was part of the Plymouth Colony until the 1691 merger with the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

The word comes from the local Wampanoag Indians, who had a settlement in the area, and has two meanings: &quot;place of rocks&quot; and &quot;song of praise&quot;. Those meanings are traditional, but the former can be segmented as &quot;(h)assun-et&quot; where&quot; hassun&quot; or &quot;assin&quot; is a word used by southern New England Algonquian to mean &quot;stone&quot;. The &quot;-et&quot; is a locative suffix, to give the meaning &quot;at the place of the stone&quot;.

The entire region was sold to the English in 1659 by the Wampanoags, but, due to the Algonquian mobile way of life and the splitting and recombining of social units, the Nipmucs may have been subject to or at the time part of the Wampanoags.

The English settlement remained for many years as a small fishing and farming village, growing to be Freetown&#x27;s more industrious side by the end of the 18th century. By the end of the 19th century, Assonet had begun to slowly return to its origins, having less and less industry in town. At the beginning of the 21st century, the village has once again begun to expand rapidly.

===17th century===
Assonet was settled on April 2, 1659, but a string of wars between English settlers and the local Wampanoag Indians, including King Philip&#x27;s War, prevented much permanent settlement until later. History shows the area existed as a proprietary settlement as early as 1680, and in 1683 Assonet and Fall River were incorporated as the Town of Freetown, named as such because its settlers were Freemen. The earliest records of the town, from approximately 1680-1685, have been lost. Since then, records have been kept and maintained to trace back the town&#x27;s legacy. Little development occurred after the incorporation of the town, other than the construction of houses and smaller businesses.

===18th century===
Assonet became a prominent commercial fishing port in Southeastern Massachusetts in the 18th century, best known for its trout. Industry had also begun to develop, including grist mills, sawmills and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. As the century progressed, the villagers began to fall under the same strains as the rest of the colonists. Assonet was far enough east that it avoided many of the problems faced during the French and Indian War, but did feature in the Revolutionary War. Skirmishes were fought in Assonet, and the Battle of Freetown was fought on the outskirts of the village in present-day Fall River. The main settled area of the village was known to support the British, even harboring a general before he fled to Newport, Rhode Island.

The white chimneys with black rings on many of the oldest houses are indicative of homes that supported the British. As the 18th century closed, churches and other more prominent buildings began to pop up around the village, including the 1794 construction of Village School, then the office of a Raynham lawyer.

===19th century===
The 19th century was perhaps the most industrious period in the history of Assonet. The village developed rapidly, with its combination of railroads, ships, its position on the stagecoach and mail routes, and its factories.

The current Route 79 roughly follows the mail and stagecoach route from Rhode Island to Boston, and the Green Dragon Tavern on South Main Street was a popular stopover along the route. The downtown area boasted shipbuilding and was an import/export port, as well as a successful fishing industry.

The N. R. Davis Gun Manufactory, located near and on a portion of where Hathaway Park now sits, opened and provided many weapons to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Also built was the Crystal Springs Bleachery and Dying Company, which brought millhousing to a small area of the village, and employed many from town and neighboring Fall River, also known for industry.

North Church (1809), Town Hall (1888), and the Guilford H. Hathaway Library (1895) were all constructed in the same small area on Taunton Hill, and complimented the Village School nicely. The Town Hall has served as the municipal office building (1888–present), meeting hall (1888–1976), library (1888–1895), police station (1888–1978), and a variety of other functions. The second floor, literally a hall, was subdivided into office space in the mid-1970s. The Guilford Hathaway Library (b. 1895) served as the town&#x27;s only library from its construction until the James White Library opened in East Freetown in 1947.

The first Post Office in town opened in Assonet in 1811, and has operated continuously since then, first in a razed building on the corner of Elm and North Main Streets, later in a second razed building, and since 1962 at the facility on South Main Street near the former Assonet Star Market. The ZIP Code for Assonet is 02702.

===20th century===
In the mid-20th century, Assonet began to remove itself from the commercial/industrial scene. Most of its mills closed during this period, following the Second World War. The N. R. Davis Gun Factory burned to the ground in 1925; and the Crystal Springs Bleachery, now New England Textile, burned in 1955. (Remnants of the latter can be found by Mill Pond.) The former Monument Manufacturing Company on Mill &amp; Locust Sts. was the largest domestic producer of sleeping bags during World War II. In the postwar period, the majority of villagers sought work outside of town, and farming also came back into common practice. This reverse trend would not last long. By the 1990s, the village began to develop again as the region was seen as a &quot;great escape&quot; for upperclass Boston workers.

Next to the Hathaway Library is a local Verizon station, which is the home of one of the first regional dialing systems. Not far away is Freetown Fire Department Company 1, constructed in 1948.

===21st century===
The Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company opened a new 1.3 million square foot (120,000 m2) distribution center on near the site of the Crystal Springs Bleachery after it received a tax increment financing agreement from the town, which has saved the company almost $2 million in property tax as of 2007. They provided over 800 jobs to the region but as of 2005, only 36 of those jobs are held by residents of Freetown. Portions of the village were designated to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Historic District==

The Assonet Historic District has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. The boundaries are, roughly, High Street, the railroad tracks, a private road, and Route 24. It contains many buildings of local and widespread historical significance, including the home of United States Secretary of State John Hay&#x27;s grandfather.

===Properties===
*Assonet Burying Ground (c.1800)
*Col. Thomas Gilbert House (c.1700)
*Freetown Town Hall (1888)
*Guilford H. Hathaway Library (1895)
*North Church (1809) (now the United Church of Assonet)
*South Church (c.1835) (now St. Bernard&#x27;s Church)
*Village School (1794)

==Churches==
In 1795, 1835, 1809, and 1937, three Christian churches were built in Assonet. Additionally, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, several Quaker meetinghouses were active.

===Baptist Church===
The original Baptist Church (1795) was built on the site of South Church. The building suffered a string of misfortune, culminating with it burning following a lightning strike 1835. Some of the building was maintained, but arguably most of the building was new as of 1835.

===South Church===
South Church (1795/1835) served as the First Christian Church of Assonet steadily until 1916, then again from 1917 to 1922. At this time, it began alternating weekly services with the Congregational Church, from 1922 to 1944. In 1968, the church combined with the Congregational Church to form the United Church of Assonet, and South Church was sold in 1979. A parsonage was built to its left in 1899, and there are cemeteries both across the street from the church, and on the property. Baptisms were originally performed in the Assonet River.

===North Church===
North Church (1809) served as the Congregational Church until 1916, when it formed the Federated Church of Assonet. Its on-and-off independence mirrored that of the First Christian Church, except from 1916 to 1917 North Church was the facility utilized. The joining of the two congregations in 1968 fell under the roof of the North Church, which is still used today. The steeple of the church contains a bell cast by Paul Revere. A non-adjacent parsonage still exists further up Taunton Hill as a business.

The church currently belongs to the United Church of Christ. Rev. Gregory N. Baker serves as minister.

===St. Bernard&#x27;s Church===

Roman Catholics did not have a home in Assonet until 1912, when a mission was created. Services were held in private homes until 1937, when St. Bernard&#x27;s Catholic Church was constructed on the site of Col. Ebeneezer Pierce&#x27;s home on South Main St. It opened in 1938.

As the congregation grew too large for the small church, St. Bernard&#x27;s Church was sold and its parishioners moved into South Church, heavily renovated and renamed St. Bernard&#x27;s Church. St. Bernard&#x27;s Parish remains in South Church , and the parsonage has remained as the rectory.

The former St. Bernard&#x27;s, which was sold in 1981, has been a string of businesses since then. Most recently, it was a diner, then a Greek restaurant, a martial arts studio, and is now a private residence.

Assonet is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River.

== Schools ==
From the early 19th century until 1950, Freetown was serviced by several neighborhood grammar schools, at least three of which existed in Assonet.

===South School===
South School, 1869–1950, currently exists at the corner of Copicut Road and South Main Street. It was a three-room schoolhouse used initially for grades 1–8, and later for grades 3–6 and &quot;special class&quot;. Grades 3–4 were in one room on the east side and grades 5–6 in one room on the west side of the building. There was one teacher for each room of two grades. Ethel O&#x27;Brien was the grades 5–6 teacher in the mid-1940s. There were no bathrooms and the outhouse (since razed) was located at the Northwest corner. A grassy play area was adjacent the grades 3–4 side of the building and Red Rover was played in the street at recess time. Before being abandoned, it spent time as an American Legion hall. It is currently unoccupied, but remains in the possession of the American Legion.

====Structure====
It is a one-story, ground-level building with three rooms. There is no discernible cellar. The building is constructed of brick, and is covered in white clapboards. Most of the windows have been removed or boarded over, so an analysis cannot be provided. There were windows on the East and West walls that are no longer visible (2012).

===Village School===
Village School, closed in 1950, currently exists on Taunton Hill between the Town Hall and North Church, being the elder of those two buildings by 94 and 15 years, respectively. It began as a lawyer&#x27;s office in 1794, then became a string of schools. Originally, the minister of North Church served as the schoolmaster. In the 1850s it was a private school, the Assonet Academy. It was purchased by the town circa 1903 and used as a grammar school until 1950 for grades 1-8, and later grades 1 and 2. In the 1940s, grades 1-2 were on the left (South) side and grades 7-8 on the right (North) side of the building. Heat was provided by a pot-bellied wood-burning stove in each room. Mrs. Cudworth was the grades 1-2 teacher and both grades were in the same room; two grades, one teacher. In the 1980s and 1990s, the structure was used for public meetings of municipal committees. Throughout its history, it served as a meeting place for local Boy and Girl Scout troops. Currently, the Town Hall uses it for storage.

====Structure====
It is a two-story building, with two rooms on the upper (primary) floor. The lower floor is a two-room cellar, and partially underground. The foundation is brick, and the building itself is wood. The exterior is white clapboards, and the front staircase has a portico and both wooden and iron railings. A cupola adorns the center of the roof, and the windows are six-over-one. The interior of the building is divided in the center, with the wall travelling parallel to School Street between the two front doors. Each room has chalkboards (blackboards) running along the walls, and hanging fixtures from the ceiling provide artificial light when necessary. The building has no plumbing and a woodstove provides heat, with a central brick chimney. An outhouse, now razed, was located at the left rear of the building.

Facing the building from Taunton Hill, the righthand room is painted in bright colors, and was formerly used for meetings of the Girl Scouts and the town&#x27;s Cultural Council. The lefthand room is panelled in faux stained wood, and was used by the Boy Scouts.

A revitalization effort seeks funds to help restore the ailing structure, which suffers from the effects of weather, rot, deterioration, and a lack of maintenance funds.

===Forge School===
The latest in a string of schools known as the Forge School closed in 1940. It functioned irregularly from c.1920 - 1940 and housed grades 7 and 8. The schoolhouse was later converted to a dwelling house, which burned in 2002. It has since been rebuilt, now with dormers. From 1857 to 1862, the Forge School existed in an outbuilding known as the &quot;corn crib&quot; on the property of Daniel Macomber on Forge Road, which was once the site of the oldest dwelling in town, dating back to the 17th century.

===Today===
From 1950 on, students have attended the Freetown Elementary School, first for grades 1-8, later K-6, and currently PreK-3. Students then attend the George R. Austin Intermediate School for grades 4-5, and Freetown-Lakeville Middle School for grades 6-8.

For public secondary education, students have three options: Apponequet Regional High School serves students with an academic focus for grades 9-12. Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester accepts students from Assonet when there are openings, and provides a voc-tech atmosphere. Bristol County Agricultural High School serves students wanting to focus primarily in agricultural and animal studies.

In addition, there are a variety of Catholic high schools in the area.

==Geography==

Assonet is located in Southeastern Massachusetts. It is bounded by Fall River, Berkley, Lakeville, East Freetown, and the Assonet River. It has a hilly terrain, with many outcroppings of bedrock. One such outcropping is the famous Profile Rock, a rock said to resemble the profile of Wampanoag Indian chief Massasoit. Maple, elm, oak, pine, and birch trees are common throughout. Numerous streams and brooks flow through the village, as does the Assonet River.

Bodies of water include Assonet Bay and Mill Pond. Bryant&#x27;s Neck, also called Assonet Bay Shores, is a large peninsula situated between Shephard&#x27;s Cove and Assonet proper on Assonet Bay. This area is also well known for its salt marshes. The area around Mill Pond is frequented for its herring runs.

A large section of the village comprises approximately one third of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest.

<doc id="713680" wikidata="Q3829918" url="?curid=713680" title="Legion of Super-Villains">
<text>The Legion of Super-Villains is a team of supervillains who appear in comic books published by DC Comics, primarily as enemies of the Legion of Super-Heroes. They first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #147 (Aug 1961).

The team originated at a time when &quot;Superman&quot; editor Mort Weisinger was consciously adding new elements to the &quot;Superman mythos&quot; over a period of years, building an extended cast of supporting characters who could provide new story opportunities. The creation of the Legion of Super-Heroes was part of that plan, and in the Legion&#x27;s fourth appearance (&quot;The Army of Living Kryptonite Men&quot; in &quot;Superboy&quot; #86, Jan 1961), it was suggested that Lex Luthor would someday lead a group of super-villains. This would come to fruition seven months later, in &quot;Superman&quot; #147&#x27;s story &quot;The Legion of Super-Villains&quot;.

==Fictional team history==
Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the Legion first appears when Lex Luthor creates a radio to contact the future, hoping to send a message to a Legion of Super-Villains, feeling there must be an evil counterpart to the Legion of Super-Heroes. He is broken out of jail by a gun, flying belt, and force-field helmet being sent into his cell. He then meets the trio of villains, Cosmic King, Lightning Lord, and Saturn Queen, who tell him of their origins. They cause trouble for Superman and finally an illusion cast by Saturn Queen succeeds in luring him to a planetoid, where a Kryptonite field holds him. He is told the origins of the LSV, and sentenced to death in a parody of the way the Legion of Super-Heroes voted him in, but the adult Legion of Super-Heroes appears and battles their foes. Luthor threatens to kill Superman, but Saturn Woman offers herself in his place. Superman asks for a tribute to her and is released after promising not to rescue her. He uses part of Saturn&#x27;s rings to create a ring round the planetoid, causing Saturn Queen to hypnotize the villains before they can kill Saturn Woman, as it is revealed Saturn&#x27;s rings somehow make the inhabitants stay good. Saturn Queen is given a fragment to make sure she stays good, and the other villains are jailed. However, they would battle Superman at other points, such as during &quot;&quot;, where they aid Brainiac in assaulting Superman at his Fortress of Solitude. They also kill Lana Lang, before fleeing back to the future when Superman brutally attacks Lightning Lord.

Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, the Legion of Super-Villains was founded by Tarik the Mute, who had suffered irreparable damage to his vocal cords during a battle with the Science Police and subsequently developed a pathological hatred of law and order. He founded a school for supervillains, which served as the headquarters and recruiting grounds for the Legion&#x27;s first incarnation, and blackmailed Colossal Boy into joining as a teacher. 

Several other incarnations of the group formed over the years, led first by Sun Emperor and then by Nemesis Kid. In the last incarnation they conquered Orando, the homeworld of Princess Projectra, and slipped it into another dimension as a base of operations. Each villain was sworn to kill one Legionnaire, but only Nemesis Kid succeeded, fatally wounding Karate Kid.

In Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, some of the members of the Legion of Super-Villains attempted to remake the universe by tampering with the origins of Superman and Batman and adopting them as their own &quot;children&quot;, eventually transforming them into the dictators of Earth, and eliminating other members of the JLA to stop them from interfering. Superman and Batman managed to overcome their brainwashing, however, due to the Darkseid of another reality telling them what had happened; they restored the timestream to its proper course, and took the villains to the 31st century to be imprisoned, but kept the memories of their lives with the villains.

===Five Years Later===
During the fourth volume of &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, the Legion of Super-Villains has disbanded, and some of its members had actually reformed. Echo joined the Legion during the Five Year Gap, but resigned after the events of Black Dawn. Lightning Lord reformed and went to work on his family&#x27;s plantation on Winath. Ron-Karr joined the Legion of Substitute Heroes and Spider Girl joined the Legion, nursing some feelings for Jo Nah and changing her identity to &quot;Wave&quot; when the Legion went on the run. Saturn Queen married Matter-Eater Lad and reformed after retrieving her family&#x27;s hypno-stone from Prince Evillo, ultimately becoming queen of Titan. Radiation Roy, however, was kidnapped by the Dominator-controlled Earthgov and almost mindwiped as a soldier for the Dominion. These events were all wiped out by &quot;Zero Hour&quot;.

===The Lightning Saga===
Manifestations of the LSV based on the nightmares of Dream Girl appeared at the end of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; vol. 3 #4 (2007), where they kill the guards of Arkham Asylum.

===Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes===
In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #859 (2008), Spider Girl and Radiation Roy are shown to be members of the xenophobic &quot;Justice League of Earth&quot;, along with other rejected Legion of Super-Heroes applicants Earth Man (formerly Absorbency Boy), Eyeful Ethel, Tusker, Golden Boy, and Storm Boy. Spider Girl is now in a relationship with Earth-Man, the League&#x27;s leader, and traded the Legionnaire White Witch to Mordru, in return for his staying off the planet. Roy now has to wear a containment suit, since his radioactive powers have caused him to develop tumors all over his body, specifically one dominating the right side of his face. Defeated by Superman and the Legionnaires, the Justice Leaguers are sent to the prison planet Takron-Galtos.

===&quot;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&quot;===

The Legion of Super-Villains appear in the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; miniseries which runs from August 2008 to September 2009. This incarnation of the Legion includes Lightning Lord, Saturn Queen, Cosmic King, Sun Emperor, Beauty Blaze, Ol-Vir, Tyr, Zymyr, Hunter, and Chameleon Chief as well as other Legion of Super-Heroes villains Black Mace, Universo, Dr. Regulus, Grimbor the Chainsman, Mordru, Esper Lass, Magno Lad, Micro Lad, Echo, Terrus, the League of Super-Assassins (Silver Slasher, Lazon, Neutrax, Mist Master, and Titania), the Fatal Five (Tharok, Emerald Empress, Persuader, Mano, and Validus), and the Justice League of Earth (Radiation Roy, Tusker, Spider Girl, Golden Boy, Storm Boy, and Earth-Man). In addition, the group is led by Superboy-Prime. The villains are broken out of Takron-Galtos by Superboy-Prime, and reveal to him that it was he who inspired them to band together.

Each member is later given copies of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; flight rings bearing Prime&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; symbol. The Legion of Super-Villains later appear on Sorcerer&#x27;s World as Mordru is trying to stop Dawnstar, Wildfire, Blok, and Green Lantern/Legionnaire Rond Vidar from rescuing the White Witch. The White Witch manages to create a stargate, but Rond forces them through and is left to fight the Legion by himself. After Vidar has fought off several Legion members, Saturn Queen gets inside his head and starts to hinder his willpower. When Prime grabs Rond by the neck, Saturn Queen tells him to wait, since Rond is Universo&#x27;s son. Universo shows no care for Rond and only wants his power ring. Rond mocks him, telling him it can never be his, and spits in his face before Prime snaps his neck. Universo tries to take his ring, but it flies off to Oa. Mordru is then offered membership in the Legion, telling him it can only be temporary, which is the same case for the Fatal Five and the Justice League of Earth. Earth Man sums it up by saying that, as much as the various villains dislike each other, they all want the Legion of Super-Heroes dead. They head for Earth and launch an attack on the Legionnaires. Eventually, the tide turns against them as the White Witch absorbs Mordru and his magic.

===Post-&quot;Legion of Three Worlds&quot;===
In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; vol. 2 #3 (2009), it was revealed that the Legion of Super-Villains has sent an espionage squad back into the 21st century.

It has also been revealed that Saturn Queen reformed the group to bring anarchy back to the universe, starting with the destruction of the worlds that house the immortal beings that represent will (Oa), faith (the Rock of Eternity), and wisdom (Utopia, the World of the Wise, homeworld of supporting character Harmonia Li).

The Legion of Super-Villains appear in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, consisting of Lightning Lord (voiced by James Arnold Taylor), Hunter, Tyr (both by Khary Payton), Esper Lass (Tara Strong), Ron-Karr (Shawn Harrison), and Wave, who has no dialogue.

<text>Thomas Ewing Sr. (December 28, 1789October 26, 1871) was a National Republican and Whig politician from Ohio. He served in the U.S. Senate and also served as the fourteenth secretary of the treasury and the first secretary of the interior. He is also known as the foster father (and subsequently father-in-law) of famous American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman.

==Biography==
Born in West Liberty, Ohio County, Virginia (now West Virginia), he was the son of American Revolutionary War veteran George Ewing. After studying at Ohio University and reading law under Philemon Beecher, Ewing began practicing law in Lancaster, Ohio, in 1816. In 1824, he was joined in that practice by Henry Stanbery.

As a colorful country lawyer, he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1830 as a Whig and served a single term. He was unsuccessful in seeking a second term in 1836. Ewing served as Secretary of the Treasury in 1841, serving under Presidents William Henry Harrison and John Tyler. He resigned on September 11, 1841, along with the entire cabinet (except Secretary of State Daniel Webster), in protest of Tyler&#x27;s veto of the Banking Act.

Ewing was later appointed to serve as the first Secretary of the Interior by President Zachary Taylor. Ewing served in the position from March 8, 1849, to July 22, 1850, under Taylor and Millard Fillmore. As James G. Blaine later wrote:
As first secretary, Ewing consolidated bureaus from various Departments, such as the Land Office from the Treasury Department and the Indian Bureau from the War Department. The bureaus were being kicked out of their offices as unwanted tenants in their former departments. However, the Interior Department had no office space, so Ewing rented space. Later, the Patent Office building, with a new east wing, provided permanent space in 1852. Ewing initiated the Interior Department&#x27;s culture of corruption by wholesale replacement of officials with political patronage. Newspapers called him &quot;Butcher Ewing&quot; for his efforts.

In 1850, Ewing was appointed to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Thomas Corwin, and served from July 20, 1850 – March 3, 1851. Ewing was unsuccessful in seeking re-election in 1850. In 1861, Ewing served as one of Ohio&#x27;s delegates to the peace conference held in Washington in hopes of staving off civil war. Ewing was a defendant of slavery at this conference, and frequently deflected attacks on the institution by Britain, stating that &#x27;we have no slavery or misery to be compared with that existing in the India provinces.&#x27; After the war, Ewing was appointed by President Andrew Johnson to a third cabinet post as Secretary of War in 1868 following the firing of Edwin M. Stanton but the Senate, still outraged at Johnson&#x27;s firing of Stanton – which had provoked Johnson&#x27;s impeachment – refused to act on the nomination.
Ewing married Maria Wills Boyle, a Roman Catholic, and raised their children in her faith. His foster son was the famous general William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman eventually married Thomas Ewing Sr.&#x27;s daughter, Ellen Ewing Sherman. Ewing&#x27;s namesake son, Thomas Ewing Jr., was an American Civil War Union army general and two-term U.S. Congressman from Ohio. Two of Ewing&#x27;s other sons – Hugh Boyle Ewing and Charles Ewing – also became generals in the Union army during the Civil War. Through Ellen and Sherman, Ewing also had a namesake grandson, Thomas Ewing Sherman.

Ewing was born a Presbyterian, but for many years attended Catholic services with his family. He was formally baptized into the Catholic faith during his last illness.

Ewing remained a Whig following his joining of the party in 1833, even when the national Whig Party collapsed and was replaced by the Republican Party. This makes Ewing one of the only federal politicians to remain a member the Whig Party when many others bolted to the Republican or American parties.

Prior to his death on October 26, 1871, Ewing had been the last surviving member of the Harrison and Tyler Cabinets. Future President and Governor of Ohio Rutherford B. Hayes was a pallbearer at his funeral. He is buried in Saint Mary Cemetery, Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio.

<text>The RL10 is a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine built in the United States by Aerojet Rocketdyne that burns cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants. Modern versions produce up to of thrust per engine in vacuum. RL10 versions were produced for the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V and the DCSS of the Delta IV. More versions are in development or in use for the Exploration Upper Stage of the Space Launch System and the Centaur V of the Vulcan rocket.

The expander cycle that the engine uses drives the turbopump with waste heat absorbed by the engine combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle. This, combined with the hydrogen fuel, leads to very high specific impulses (&quot;I&quot;sp) in the range of in a vacuum. Mass ranges from depending on the version of the engine.

==History==
The RL10 was the first liquid hydrogen rocket engine to be built in the United States, with development of the engine by Marshall Space Flight Center and Pratt &amp; Whitney beginning in the 1950s. The RL10 was originally developed as a throttleable engine for the USAF Lunex lunar lander.

The RL10 was first tested on the ground in 1959, at Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s Florida Research and Development Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. The first successful flight took place on November 27, 1963. For that launch, two RL10A-3 engines powered the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas launch vehicle. The launch was used to conduct a heavily instrumented performance and structural integrity test of the vehicle.

Multiple versions of this engine have been flown. The S-IV of the Saturn I used a cluster of six RL10A-3S, a version which was modified for installation on the Saturn and the Titan program included Centaur D-1T upper stages powered by two RL10A-3-3 Engines.

Four modified RL10A-5 engines were used in the McDonnell Douglas DC-X.

A flaw in the brazing of an RL10B-2 combustion chamber was identified as the cause of failure for the 4 May 1999 Delta III launch carrying the Orion-3 communications satellite.

The DIRECT version 3.0 proposal to replace Ares I and Ares V with a family of rockets sharing a common core stage recommended the RL10 for the second stage of the J-246 and J-247 launch vehicles. Up to seven RL10 engines would have been used in the proposed Jupiter Upper Stage, serving an equivalent role to the Space Launch System Exploration Upper Stage.

===Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine===
In the early 2000s, NASA contracted with Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne to develop
the Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE) demonstrator. CECE was intended to lead to RL10 engines capable of deep throttling. In 2007, its operability (with some &quot;chugging&quot;) was demonstrated at 11:1 throttle ratios. In 2009, NASA reported successfully throttling from 104 percent thrust to eight percent thrust, a record for an expander cycle engine of this type. Chugging was eliminated by injector and propellant feed system modifications that control the pressure, temperature and flow of propellants. In 2010, the throttling range was expanded further to a 17.6:1 ratio, throttling from 104% to 5.9% power.

===Early 2010s possible successor===
In 2012 NASA joined with the US Air Force (USAF) to study next-generation upper stage propulsion, formalizing the agencies&#x27; joint interests in a new upper stage engine to replace the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10.
From the study, NASA hoped to find a less expensive RL10-class engine for the upper stage of the Space Launch System (SLS).

USAF hoped to replace the Rocketdyne RL10 engines used on the upper stages of the Lockheed Martin Atlas V and the Boeing Delta IV Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) that were the primary methods of putting US government satellites into space. A related requirements study was conducted at the same time under the Affordable Upper Stage Engine Program (AUSEP).

===Improvements===
The RL10 has evolved over the years. The RL10B-2 that was used on the DCSS had improved performance, an extendable carbon-carbon nozzle, electro-mechanical gimbaling for reduced weight and increased reliability, and a specific impulse of .

As of 2016, Aerojet Rocketdyne was working toward incorporating additive manufacturing into the RL10 construction process. The company conducted full-scale, hot-fire tests on an engine that had a printed main injector in March 2016. Another project by Aerojet Rocketdyne was an engine with a printed thrust chamber assembly in April 2017.

==Applications==

=== Current ===
*Centaur III: The single engine centaur (SEC) version uses the RL10C-1, while the dual engine centaur (DEC) version retains the smaller RL10A-4-2. An Atlas V mission (SBIRS-5) marked the first use of the RL10C-1-1 version. The mission was successful but observed unexpected vibration, and further use of the RL10C-1-1 model is on hold until the problem is better understood. The engine was used again successfully on SBIRS-6.
*Centaur V stage: On May 11, 2018, United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced that the RL10 upper stage engine had been selected for its Vulcan Centaur rocket following a competitive procurement process. Early versions of the Centaur V will use the RL10C-1-1, but later versions will transition to the RL10C-X. Vulcan flew its successful maiden flight on January 8, 2024.
*Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage: The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage or ICPS is used for the SLS and is similar to the DCSS, except that the engine is an RL10B-2 and it is adapted to fit on top of the 8.4 meter diameter core stage with four RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engines.

=== In development ===
*Exploration Upper Stage: The Exploration Upper Stage will use four RL10C-3 engines.

=== Cancelled ===
* OmegA Upper Stage: In April 2018, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems announced that two RL10C-5-1 engines would be used on OmegA in the upper stage. Blue Origin&#x27;s BE-3U and Airbus Safran&#x27;s Vinci were also considered before Aerojet Rocketdyne&#x27;s engine was selected. OmegA development was halted after it failed to win a National Security Space Launch contract.
* Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage: , an enhanced version of the RL10 was proposed to power the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES), a long-duration, low-boiloff extension of existing ULA Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) technology for the Vulcan launch vehicle. Long-duration ACES technology is intended to support geosynchronous, cislunar, and interplanetary missions. Another possible application is as in-space propellant depots in LEO or at that could be used as way-stations for other rockets to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO or interplanetary missions. Cleanup of space debris was also proposed.

<doc id="713688" wikidata="Q311005" url="?curid=713688" title="Alain Badiou">
<text>Alain Badiou (; ; born 17 January 1937) is a French philosopher, formerly chair of Philosophy at the École normale supérieure (ENS) and founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the Université de Paris VIII with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Jean-François Lyotard. Badiou&#x27;s work is heavily informed by philosophical applications of mathematics, in particular set theory and category theory. Badiou&#x27;s &quot;Being and Event&quot; project considers the concepts of being, truth, event and the subject defined by a rejection of linguistic relativism seen as typical of postwar French thought. Unlike his peers, Badiou openly believes in the idea of universalism and truth. His work is notable for his widespread applications of various conceptions of indifference. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force.

==Biography==
Badiou is the son of the mathematician (1905–1996), who was a working member of the Resistance in France during World War II. Alain Badiou was a student at the Lycée Louis-Le-Grand and then the École Normale Supérieure (1955–1960). In 1960, he wrote his &quot;&quot; (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Spinoza for Georges Canguilhem (the topic was &quot;Structures of Demonstration in the First Two Books of Spinoza&#x27;s Ethics&quot;, &quot;Structures démonstratives dans les deux premiers livres de l&#x27;Éthique de Spinoza&quot;). He taught at the lycée in Reims from 1963 where he became a close friend of fellow playwright (and philosopher) François Regnault, and published two novels before moving first to the faculty of letters of the University of Reims (the &quot;collège littéraire universitaire&quot;) and then to the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis) in 1969. Badiou was politically active very early on, and was one of the founding members of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU). The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the decolonization of Algeria. He wrote his first novel, &quot;Almagestes&quot;, in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by Louis Althusser, became increasingly influenced by Jacques Lacan and became a member of the editorial board of &quot;Cahiers pour l&#x27;Analyse&quot;. By then he &quot;already had a solid grounding in mathematics and logic (along with Lacanian theory)&quot;, and his own two contributions to the pages of &quot;Cahiers&quot; &quot;anticipate many of the distinctive concerns of his later philosophy&quot;.

The student uprisings of May 1968 reinforced Badiou&#x27;s commitment to the far Left, and he participated in increasingly militant groups, such as the (UCFml). To quote Badiou himself, the UCFml is &quot;the Maoist organization established in late 1969 by Natacha Michel, Sylvain Lazarus, myself and a fair number of young people&quot;. During this time, Badiou joined the faculty of the newly founded University of Paris VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis) which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard, whose philosophical works he considered unhealthy deviations from the Althusserian program of a scientific Marxism.

In the 1980s, as both Althusserian structural Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis went into decline (after Lacan died and Althusser was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Badiou published more technical and abstract philosophical works, such as &quot;Théorie du sujet&quot; (1982), and his magnum opus, &quot;Being and Event&quot; (1988). Nonetheless, Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan, and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more recent works (most notably &quot;Petit panthéon portatif&quot; / &quot;Pocket Pantheon&quot;).

He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions, such as the Collège International de Philosophie. He was a member of which, as mentioned above, he founded in 1985 with some comrades from the Maoist UCFml. This organization disbanded in 2007, according to the French Wikipedia article (linked to in the previous sentence). In 2002, he was a co-founder of the Centre International d&#x27;Etude de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine, alongside Yves Duroux and his former student Quentin Meillassoux. Badiou has also enjoyed success as a dramatist with plays such as &quot;Ahmed le Subtil&quot;.

In the last decade, an increasing number of Badiou&#x27;s works have been translated into English, such as &quot;Ethics&quot;, &quot;Deleuze&quot;, &quot;Manifesto for Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Metapolitics&quot;, and &quot;Being and Event&quot;. Short pieces by Badiou have likewise appeared in American and English periodicals, such as &quot;Lacanian Ink&quot;, &quot;New Left Review&quot;, &quot;Radical Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Cosmos and History&quot; and &quot;Parrhesia&quot;. Unusually for a contemporary European philosopher his work is increasingly being taken up by militants in countries like India, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.

In 2014–15, Badiou had the role of Honorary President at The Global Center for Advanced Studies.

== Key concepts ==

Badiou makes repeated use of several concepts throughout his philosophy, which he discerns from close readings of the philosophical literature from the classical period. His own method cannot be fully understood if it is not situated within the tradition of French academic philosophy. Badiou&#x27;s work engages a detailed decrypting of texts, in line with philosophers such as Foucault, Deleuze, Balibar, Bourdieu, Derrida, Bouveresse and Engel, all of whom he studied with at the Ecole Normale Superieure.

One of the aims of his thought is to show that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore, he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou&#x27;s philosophy can be regarded as a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism.

===Conditions===
According to Badiou, philosophy is suspended from four conditions (art, love, politics, and science), each of them fully independent &quot;truth procedures.&quot; (For Badiou&#x27;s notion of truth procedures, see below.) Badiou consistently maintains throughout his work (but most systematically in &quot;Manifesto for Philosophy&quot;) that philosophy must avoid the temptation to suture itself (&#x27;sew itself&#x27;, that is, to hand over its entire intellectual effort) to any of these independent truth procedures. When philosophy does suture itself to one of its conditions (and Badiou argues that the history of philosophy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is primarily a history of sutures), what results is a philosophical &quot;disaster.&quot; Consequently, philosophy is, according to Badiou, a thinking of the &quot;compossibility&quot; of the several truth procedures, whether this is undertaken through the investigation of the intersections between distinct truth procedures (the intersection of art and love in the novel, for instance), or whether this is undertaken through the more traditionally philosophical work of addressing categories like truth or the subject (concepts that are, as concepts, external to the individual truth procedures, though they are functionally operative in the truth procedures themselves). For Badiou, when philosophy addresses the four truth procedures in a genuinely philosophical manner, rather than through a suturing abandonment of philosophy as such, it speaks of them with a theoretical terminology that marks its philosophical character: &quot;inaesthetics&quot; rather than art; metapolitics rather than politics; ontology rather than science; etc.

Truth, for Badiou, is a specifically philosophical category. While philosophy&#x27;s several conditions are, on their own terms, &quot;truth procedures&quot; (i.e., they produce truths as they are pursued), it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures &quot;as&quot; truth procedures. (The lover, for instance, does not think of her love as a question of truth, but simply and rightly as a question of love. Only the philosopher sees in the true lover&#x27;s love the unfolding of a truth.) Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth, one that is strongly against the grain of much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant (always and everywhere the case, eternal and unchanging) and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badiou&#x27;s theory of truth, exposited throughout his work, accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence (such that invariance does not imply self-evidence), as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity (such that constructedness does not lead to relativism).

The idea, here, is that a truth&#x27;s invariance makes it genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed unless there is a rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in &quot;Being and Event&quot; and fleshed out in important ways in &quot;Logics of Worlds&quot;. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou&#x27;s work under the title of the &quot;veridical&quot;). While such knowledge is produced in the process of being faithful to a truth event, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms &quot;democratic materialism,&quot; denies the existence of truth and only recognizes &quot;bodies&quot; and &quot;languages.&quot; Badiou proposes a turn towards the &quot;materialist dialectic,&quot; which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, &quot;except&quot; there are also truths.

===Inaesthetic===
In &quot;Handbook of Inaesthetics&quot; Badiou both draws on the original Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of &quot;aesthesis&quot; as &quot;material perception&quot; and coins the phrase &quot;inaesthetic&quot; to refer to a concept of artistic creation that denies &quot;the reflection/object relation&quot; yet, at the same time, in reaction against the idea of mimesis, or poetic reflection of &quot;nature&quot;, he affirms that art is &quot;immanent&quot; and &quot;singular&quot;. Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art, and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alonehence reviving the ancient materialist concept of &quot;aesthesis&quot;. His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy, which he claims functions so as to &quot;arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them&quot;. He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of Samuel Beckett and the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé and Fernando Pessoa (who he argues has developed a body of work that philosophy is currently incapable of incorporating), among others.

==&quot;Being and Event&quot;==
The major propositions of Badiou&#x27;s philosophy all find their basis in &quot;Being and Event&quot;, in which he continues his attempt (which he began in &quot;Théorie du sujet&quot;) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies. A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, any notion of a subject. Badiou&#x27;s work is, by his own admission, an attempt to break out of contemporary philosophy&#x27;s fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in &quot;Being and Event&quot;, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both &#x27;analytical&#x27; and &#x27;continental&#x27; traditions. In Badiou&#x27;s own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up. &quot;Being and Event&quot; offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.

As is implied in the title of the book, two elements mark the thesis of &quot;Being and Event&quot;: the place of ontology, or &#x27;the science of being qua being&#x27; (being in itself), and the place of the event – which is seen as a rupture in being – through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory, and specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. In short, the event is a truth caused by a hidden &quot;part&quot; or set appearing within existence; this part escapes language and known existence, and thus being itself lacks the terms and resources to fully process the event.

===Mathematics as ontology===

For Badiou the problem which the Greek tradition of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with is that while beings themselves are plural, and thought in terms of multiplicity, being itself is thought to be singular; that is, &quot;it&quot; is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration: that the One is not (&quot;l&#x27;Un n&#x27;est pas&quot;). This is why Badiou accords set theory (the axioms of which he refers to as the &quot;ideas of the multiple&quot;) such stature, and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology: Only set theory allows one to conceive a &#x27;pure doctrine of the multiple&#x27;. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set (that is, another set too). What individuates a set, therefore, is not an existential positive proposition, but other multiples whose properties (i.e., &quot;structural&quot; relations) validate its presentation. The &quot;structure&quot; of being thus secures the regime of the count-as-one. So if one is to think of a set – for instance, the set of people, or humanity – as counting as one, the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept (humanity), but only in terms of what does &quot;not&quot; belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one, which makes multiplicities thinkable, implies (somehow or other) that the proper name of &quot;being&quot; does not belong to an &quot;element&quot; as such (an original &#x27;one&#x27;), but rather the void set (written Ø), the set to which nothing (not even the void set itself) belongs. It may help to understand the concept &#x27;count-as-one&#x27; if it is associated with the concept of &#x27;terming&#x27;: a multiple is &quot;not&quot; one, but it is referred to with &#x27;multiple&#x27;: one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as &#x27;multiple&#x27; does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology: for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology, within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term, is impossible. &#x27;Terminology&#x27; implies precisely difference between terms (thus multiplicity) as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent, the count-as-one is a &quot;structural effect&quot; or a &quot;situational operation&quot;; it is not an event of &#x27;truth&#x27;. Multiples which are &#x27;composed&#x27; or &#x27;consistent&#x27; are count-effects. &#x27;Inconsistent multiplicity&#x27; [&quot;meaning?&quot;] is [somehow or other] &#x27;the presentation of presentation.&#x27;

Badiou&#x27;s use of set theory in this manner is not just illustrative or heuristic. Badiou uses the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory to identify the relationship of being to history, Nature, the State, and God. Most significantly this use means that (as with set theory) there is a strict prohibition on self-belonging; a set cannot contain or belong to itself. This results from the axiom of foundation – or the axiom of regularity – which enacts such a prohibition (cf. p. 190 in &quot;Being and Event&quot;). (This axiom states that every non-empty set A contains an element y that is disjoint from A.) Badiou&#x27;s philosophy draws two major implications from this prohibition. Firstly, it secures the inexistence of the &#x27;one&#x27;: there cannot be a grand overarching set, and thus it is fallacious to conceive of a grand cosmos, a whole Nature, or a Being of God. Badiou is therefore – against Georg Cantor, from whom he draws heavily – staunchly atheist. However, secondly, this prohibition prompts him to introduce the event. Because, according to Badiou, the axiom of foundation &#x27;founds&#x27; all sets in the void, it ties all being to the historico-social situation of the multiplicities of de-centred sets – thereby effacing the positivity of subjective action, or an entirely &#x27;new&#x27; occurrence. And whilst this is acceptable ontologically, it is unacceptable, Badiou holds, philosophically. Set theory mathematics has consequently &#x27;pragmatically abandoned&#x27; an area which philosophy cannot. And so, Badiou argues, there is therefore only one possibility remaining: that ontology can say nothing about the event.

Several critics have questioned Badiou&#x27;s use of mathematics. Mathematician Alan Sokal and physicist Jean Bricmont write that Badiou proposes, with seemingly &quot;utter seriousness,&quot; a blending of psychoanalysis, politics and set theory that they contend is preposterous. Similarly, philosopher and aesthetics writer Roger Scruton has questioned Badiou&#x27;s grasp of the foundation of mathematics, writing in 2012:
:There is no evidence that I can find in &quot;Being and Event&quot; that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor&#x27;s theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen&#x27;s proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou&#x27;s texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician&#x27;s wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.

An example of a critique from a mathematician&#x27;s point of view is the essay &#x27;Badiou&#x27;s Number: A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology&#x27; by Ricardo L. Nirenberg and David Nirenberg, which takes issue in particular with Badiou&#x27;s matheme of the Event in &quot;Being and Event&quot;, which has already been alluded to in respect of the &#x27;axiom of foundation&#x27; above. Nirenberg and Nirenberg write:

:Rather than being defined in terms of objects previously defined, &quot;ex&quot; is here defined in terms of itself; you must already have it in order to define it. Set theorists call this a not-well-founded set. This kind of set never appears in mathematicsnot least because it produces an unmathematical &quot;mise-en-abîme&quot;: if we replace &quot;ex&quot; inside the bracket by its expression as a bracket, we can go on doing this foreverand so can hardly be called &quot;a matheme.&quot;&#x27;

===The event and the subject===

Badiou again turns here to mathematics and set theory – Badiou&#x27;s language of ontology – to study the possibility of an indiscernible element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician Paul J. Cohen, using what are called the &quot;conditions&quot; of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination, a domination being that which defines a set. (If one takes, in binary language, the set with the condition &#x27;items marked only with ones&#x27;, any item marked with zero negates the property of the set. The condition which has only ones is thus dominated by any condition which has zeros in it [cf. pp. 367–371 in &quot;Being and Event&quot;].) Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible (nameable or constructible) set is dominated by the conditions which don&#x27;t possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. (The property &#x27;one&#x27; is always dominated by &#x27;not one&#x27;.) These sets are, in line with constructible ontology, relative to one&#x27;s being-in-the-world and one&#x27;s being in language (where sets and concepts, such as the concept &#x27;humanity&#x27;, get their names). However, he continues, the dominations themselves are, whilst being relative concepts, not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination – in the terms of mathematical ontology – as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a &#x27;set of dominations&#x27;, which he refers to as the indiscernible set, or the generic set. It is therefore, he continues, possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language, by a process Cohen calls forcing. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the indiscernible, it falls to the subject – about which the ontological situation cannot comment – to nominate this indiscernible, this generic point; and thus nominate, and give name to, the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought.

Badiou&#x27;s ultimate ethical maxim is therefore one of: &#x27;decide upon the undecidable&#x27;. It is to name the indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, it is important to note, &quot;becomes&quot; a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a &#x27;generic procedure&#x27;, which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.

In line with his concept of the event, Badiou maintains, politics is not about politicians, but activism based on the present situation and the (his translators&#x27; neologism) rupture. So too does love have this characteristic of becoming &quot;anew&quot;. Even in science the guesswork that marks the event is prominent. He vigorously rejects the tag of &#x27;decisionist&#x27; (the idea that once something is decided it &#x27;becomes true&#x27;), but rather argues that the recasting of a truth comes prior to its veracity or verifiability. As he says of Galileo (p. 401):

:&quot;When Galileo announced the principle of inertia, he was still separated from the truth of the new physics by all the chance encounters that are named in subjects such as Descartes or Newton. How could he, with the names he fabricated and displaced (because they were at hand – &#x27;movement&#x27;, &#x27;equal proportion&#x27;, etc.), have supposed the veracity of his principle for the situation to-come that was the establishment of modern science; that is, the supplementation of his situation with the indiscernible and unfinishable part that one has to name &#x27;rational physics&#x27;?&quot;

While Badiou is keen to reject an equivalence between politics and philosophy, he correlates nonetheless his political activism and skepticism toward the parliamentary-democratic process with his philosophy, based around singular, situated truths, and potential revolutions.

==L&#x27;Organisation Politique==
Alain Badiou is a founding member (along with Natacha Michel and Sylvain Lazarus) of the militant French political organisation L&#x27;Organisation Politique, which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007. It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions, L&#x27;Organisation Politique highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (&quot;les sans papiers&quot;), stressing that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.

==Public controversies==
===Anti-Semitism accusation and response===
In 2005, a controversy in Parisian intellectual life erupted after the publication of Badiou&#x27;s &quot;Circonstances 3: Portées du mot &#x27;juif&quot;&#x27; (&quot;The Uses of the Word &#x27;Jew&#x27;&quot;). The author criticised Israel&#x27;s &quot;identitarian claim to be a Jewish state&quot; and advocated for a secular Palestine in its place. This book generated a strong response, and the wrangling became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; with articles going back and forth in the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; and in the cultural journal &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;. Linguist and Lacanian philosopher Jean-Claude Milner, a past president of Collège international de philosophie, accused Badiou of anti-Semitism.

Badiou forcefully rebutted this charge, declaring that his accusers often conflate a nation-state with religious preference and will label as anti-Semitic anyone who objects to this tendency: &quot;It is wholly intolerable to be accused of anti-Semitism by anyone for the sole reason that, from the fact of the extermination, one does not conclude as to the predicate &quot;Jew&quot; and its religious and communitarian dimension that it receive some singular valorizationa transcendent annunciation!nor that Israeli exactions, whose colonial nature is patent and banal, be specially tolerated. I propose that nobody any longer accept, publicly or privately, this type of political blackmail.&quot;

Badiou characterizes the state of Israel as &quot;neither more nor less impure than all states&quot;, but objects to &quot;its exclusive identitarian claim to be a Jewish state, and the way it draws incessant privileges from this claim, especially when it comes to trampling underfoot what serves us as international law.&quot; For example, he continues, &quot;The Islamic states are certainly no more progressive as models than the various versions of the &#x27;Arab nation&#x27; were. Everyone agrees, it seems, on the point that the Taliban do not embody the path of modernity for Afghanistan.” A modern democracy, he writes, must count all its residents as citizens, and &quot;there is no acceptable reason to exempt the state of Israel from that rule. The claim is sometimes made that this state is the only &#x27;democratic&#x27; state in the region. But the fact that this state presents itself as a Jewish state is directly contradictory.&quot;

Badiou is optimistic that ongoing political problems can be resolved by de-emphasizing the communitarian religious dimension: &quot;The signifier &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; or &#x27;Arab&#x27; should not be glorified any more than is permitted for the signifier &#x27;Jew.&#x27; As a result, the legitimate solution to the Middle East conflict is not the dreadful institution of two barbed-wire states. The solution is the creation of a secular and democratic Palestine...which would show that it is perfectly possible to create a place in these lands where, from a political point of view and regardless of the apolitical continuity of customs, there is &#x27;neither Arab nor Jew.&#x27; This will undoubtedly demand a regional Mandela.&quot;

===Sarkozy pamphlet===
Alain Badiou gained notoriety in 2007 with his pamphlet &quot;The Meaning of Sarkozy&quot; (&quot;De quoi Sarkozy est-il le nom?&quot;), which quickly sold 60,000 copies, whereas for 40 years the sales of his books had oscillated between 2,000 and 6,000 copies.

As Rafael Bahr pointed out at the time (in 2009), Badiou despised Sarkozy and barely could write his name. Instead, Badiou usually called Sarkozy &quot;the Rat Man&quot; throughout &quot;The Meaning of Sarkozy.&quot; Steven Poole also pointed out that this characterization (Rat Man) brought charges of antisemitism against Badiou. But as Bahr notes, the controversy went beyond antisemitism, striking at the heart of what it means to be French: Mark Fisher was impressed with Badiou’s efforts:

<text>William Allen Trimble (April 4, 1786December 13, 1821) was a Democratic-Republican politician from Ohio. He was in the United States Senate.

==Biography==
Trimble was born in Woodford, Kentucky, the son of James and Jane (Allen) Trimble. He graduated from Transylvania College and was admitted to the bar in 1811. He briefly practiced law in Highland County, Ohio, from 1811 to 1812.

In the subsequent years he served in a variety of capacities, mostly with the Ohio militia and the U.S. Army in campaigns against the Pottawatomie Indians. He was a major of the Ohio Volunteers in 1812 and major of the Twenty-sixth United States Infantry in 1813. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the First United States Infantry in 1814.

<text>During its time as a French colony, Obock issued its own postage stamps. At first the inhabitants used the general stamps of the French Colonies, but in 1892 they were overprinted with &quot;OBOCK&quot;, as were stamped post cards. Later in the year some of these were also surcharged with values from 1 centime to 5 francs. By the end of the year, a supply of the omnibus Navigation and Commerce issues became available, inscribed OBOCK in red or blue.

1893 and 1894 brought the stamps for which Obock is most famous among philatelists: a series of imperforate stamps with simulated perforations, a scalloped line resembling the outline of a perforated stamps, printed all around the design. In addition, the 2-franc and higher denomination stamps are in the shape of a large equilateral triangle. While the low values are relatively common, the triangular stamps are more scarce.

Although with the departure of the government from Obock, it is hard to believe that much mail came or went from the little port town, used stamps are no more valuable than unused. Authentic uses on cover are not often seen however.

Stamps issued for the whole French Somali Coast superseded the stamps of Obock.

<doc id="713711" wikidata="Q7962595" url="?curid=713711" title="Wall Drug">
<text>Wall Drug Store, often called simply Wall Drug, is a roadside attraction and tourist stop located in the town of Wall, South Dakota, adjacent to Badlands National Park. Wall Drug consists of a collection of cowboy-themed stores, including a drug store, gift shop, several restaurants, and various other stores, as well as an art gallery and an 80-foot (24 m) brontosaurus sculpture. Unlike a traditional shopping mall, all the stores at Wall Drug operate under a single entity rather than being run individually. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described Wall Drug as &quot;a sprawling tourist attraction of international renown [that] draws some two million annual visitors to a remote town&quot;.

==History==
The small-town drugstore made its first step towards fame when it was purchased by Ted Hustead in 1931. Hustead was a Nebraska native and pharmacist who was looking for a small town with a Catholic church in which to establish his business. He bought Wall Drug, located in a 231-person town in what he referred to as &quot;the middle of nowhere,&quot; and strove to make a living. Business was very slow until his wife, Dorothy, thought of advertising free ice water to thirsty travelers heading to the newly opened Mount Rushmore monument to the west. From that time on, business was brisk.

Ted&#x27;s son, Bill Hustead, also a pharmacist, returned to Wall and joined the family business in 1951. Under his direction, Wall Drug grew into a cowboy-themed mall and department store. In addition, he created the Art Gallery Cafe, with a design inspired by Club &quot;21&quot; in New York City, one of his favorite restaurants. In addition, Wall Drug includes a western art museum, a chapel based on the one found at New Melleray Abbey near Dubuque, Iowa, another Bill Hustead creation, and an brontosaurus that can be seen right off Interstate 90. It was designed by Emmet Sullivan, who also created the dinosaurs at Dinosaur Park in Rapid City and Dinosaur World in Arkansas.

Bill Hustead had seven children, and his oldest child, Rick Hustead, is the current proprietor of Wall Drug Store.

==Marketing campaign==
Wall Drug earns much of its fame from its self-promotion. Billboards advertising the establishment can be seen for hundreds of miles throughout South Dakota and the neighboring states. In addition, many visitors of Wall Drug have erected signs throughout the world announcing the miles to Wall Drug from famous locations. By 1981, Wall Drug was claiming it was giving away 20,000 cups of water per day during the peak tourist season, lasting from Memorial Day until Labor Day, and during the hottest days of the summer.

Most of Wall Drug&#x27;s advertisement billboards can be found on an approximately stretch of Interstate 90 from Minnesota to Billings, Montana. The signs are created by South Dakota billboard artists, including Dobby Hansen and Barry Knutson of Philip.

== Today ==

To date, Wall Drug still offers free ice water, but as they have become more popular, they have started to offer free bumper stickers to aid in promotion, and coffee for 5 cents. Some popular free bumper stickers read &quot;Where the heck is Wall Drug?&quot; and &quot;Have You Dug Wall Drug?&quot;.

Wall Drug has over 300 original oil paintings in the Western Art Gallery Dining Rooms. This acquisition represents one of the country&#x27;s best private collections of original Western and Illustration Art. Artists featured include N. C. Wyeth, Harvey Dunn, Dean Cornwell, Louis Glanzman, and Harold Von Schmidt.

When the United States Air Force was still operating Minuteman missile silos in the western South Dakota plains, Wall Drug used to offer free coffee and doughnuts to service personnel if they stopped in on their way to or from Ellsworth Air Force Base ( west on Interstate 90). To this day, Wall Drug continues to offer coffee and doughnuts which are free to active military personnel and also popular among ordinary tourists.

Ted and Bill Hustead died in 1999. The following day, South Dakota Governor Bill Janklow began his annual State of the State address by commemorating Hustead as &quot;a guy that figured out that free ice water could turn you into a phenomenal success in the middle of a semi-arid desert way out in the middle of someplace&quot;.

<doc id="713718" wikidata="Q3678778" url="?curid=713718" title="Civil Rights Act of 1957">
<text>The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first federal civil rights legislation passed by the United States Congress since the Civil Rights Act of 1875. The bill was passed by the 85th United States Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 9, 1957.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 ruling in the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; brought the issue of school desegregation to the fore of public attention, as Southern Democratic leaders began a campaign of &quot;massive resistance&quot; against desegregation. In the midst of this campaign, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill designed to provide federal protection for African American voting rights; most African Americans in the Southern United States had been disenfranchised by state and local laws. Though the civil rights bill passed Congress, opponents of the act were able to remove or weaken several provisions via the Anderson–Aiken amendment and the O&#x27;Mahoney jury trial amendment, significantly watering down its immediate impact. During the debate over the law, Senator Strom Thurmond conducted the longest one-person filibuster in Senate history. Under the direction of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, the Senate passed a watered-down, yet also passable, version of the House bill which removed stringent voting protection clauses.

Despite having a limited impact on African American voter participation, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did establish the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. Congress would later pass far more effective civil rights laws in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

==Background==
Following the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown&quot;, which eventually led to the integration of public schools, Southern whites began a campaign of &quot;Massive Resistance&quot;. Violence against black people rose; in Little Rock, Arkansas where President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered U.S. paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division to protect nine black teenagers integrating into a public school, the first time federal troops were deployed in the South to settle civil rights issues since the Reconstruction Era. There had been continued physical assaults against suspected activists and bombings of schools and churches in the South. Partly in an effort to defuse calls for more far-reaching reforms, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill that would increase the protection of African American voting rights.

By 1957, only about 20% of black people were registered to vote. Despite being the majority in numerous counties and congressional districts in the South, most black people had been effectively disfranchised by discriminatory voter registration rules and laws in those states since the late 19th and early 20th centuries that were heavily instituted and propagated by Southern Democrats. Civil rights organizations had collected evidence of discriminatory practices, such as the administration of literacy and comprehension tests and poll taxes. While the states had the right to establish rules for voter registration and elections, the federal government found an oversight role in ensuring that citizens could exercise the constitutional right to vote for federal officers: electors for president and vice president and members of the US Congress.

==Legislative history==

The Democratic Senate majority leader, Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, who would play a vital role in the bill&#x27;s passage in the Senate, realized that the bill and its journey through Congress could tear apart his party, as southern Democrats vehemently opposed civil rights, and its northern members were strongly in favor of them. Southern Democratic senators occupied chairs of numerous important committees because of their long seniority. As, in the near-century between the end of Reconstruction and the 1960s, white Southerners voted solidly as a bloc for the Democrats, Southern Democrats in Congress rarely lost their seats in elections, ensuring that they had more seniority than Democratic members of Congress from other parts of the country. Johnson sent the bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Democratic Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who drastically altered the bill. Democratic Senator Richard Russell Jr., of Georgia had denounced the bill as an example of the federal government seeking to impose its laws on states. Johnson sought recognition from civil rights advocates for passing the bill as well as recognition from the anti-civil rights Democrats for weakening the bill so much as to make it toothless.

As well as a general if vague support for civil rights as the party of Lincoln, Republicans saw that this could be an effective way to increase the number of Black Republican voters as the blocking of the Bill by the Democrats in the Southern Caucus would become obvious. They, like Johnson, also saw the potential for dividing the Democratic party&#x27;s Northern and Southern wings. This meant that the (on this issue) liberal but hardball Republican operators like the Vice President, Richard Nixon, who had a constitutional right to chair the Senate took a great interest in the Bill. Conservative Republican Senators who were sympathetic to Southern arguments on States rights were more likely to vote on a party basis. On the other hand, the Republicans were willing to quietly allow Democratic Southern obstruction if this meant that African-American and liberal voters would be more likely to see the culprits as Democrats.

=== Anderson–Aiken amendment ===
A bipartisan group of Senators realized that Southerners would not allow passage of the act with Title III, which authorized the US Attorney General to seek preventive relief in civil rights cases. Majority Leader Johnson convinced Senator Clinton Anderson (D-NM) to introduce an amendment to strip out the enforcement provisions of Title III. Anderson&#x27;s initial hesitancy to be associated with the anti-civil rights bloc was met with Johnson&#x27;s urging to introduce the amendment along with a Republican colleague. Anderson approached George Aiken (R-VT), who agreed to co-sponsor the amendment.

A crucial cause of the weakening of support for Title III was a speech given by the unofficial leader of the Southern Caucus the Georgian Democrat, Richard Russell, who pointed out that Title III was not a new law but an amendment of Section 1985 of Title 42 of the United States Code. It seems that this had not been understood previously by either the opponents or the supporters of the Civil Rights Act, including Douglas or Brownell. In his speech Russell drew out the implications of this, including the invocation of Section 1993 of Title 42 of the United States Code, a Reconstruction era law which wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the bill and which authorized the President to enforce judicial decisions - which would include &quot;Brown v Board&quot;. This specter of military involvement in domestic politics became a worry not just for moderate previous supporters of the bill such as Bourke Hickenlooper (R-IA) - who after Russell&#x27;s speech referred to Title III as a &quot;violation of the civil rights of the white race.&quot; - but also strong supporters such as Douglas. Later President Eisenhower in answer to a direct question on Russell&#x27;s charges distanced himself from the &quot;exact language&quot; of Title III.

President Eisenhower did not express enthusiasm for the provisions in Title III. In a press conference, he referred to it as going &quot;too far too fast in laws&quot;, and instead placed an emphasis on the voting rights provisions in Title IV. This diminished the already-waning support for the title among Republicans, many of whom opposed its expansion of federal power on conservative grounds in spite of their sympathy towards civil rights causes.

The Anderson–Aiken amendment passed by a 52–38 vote. The vote on the amendment did not split purely along partisan or ideological lines; it was opposed by conservative William Knowland (R-CA) and supported by liberal Frank Church (D-ID).

=== Jury trial amendment ===
Majority Leader Johnson, who was intent on passing a fully weakened act in contrast to overseeing a legislative graveyard at the hands of a Southern filibuster, moved to effectively weaken the voting rights-related provisions in Title IV. Alleged violators of civil rights injunctions are normally entitled to jury trials, with the exception of civil contempt actions. A jury trial amendment that included the guarantee of jury trials in civil contempt actions would, in the South, result in perpetrators of voter suppression being acquitted by an all-white jury, thus ensuring no resulted accomplishment to enfranchise blacks.

The jury trial amendment was not introduced by a Southern Democrat, instead being spearheaded by Wyoming senator Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney. The motivation for Western liberal Democrats to spearhead the cause of weakening the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was attributed to their traditional populist disdain for the perceived disproportionate power wielded by judges to quell labor causes in the Western United States, thus contributing to a resonance with the expansion of jury trial rights, although Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro also claims that Johnson had facilitated a bargain that Western liberal Democrats would vote with the South in important votes on Civil Rights in return for Southern support for public involvement in the building of the Hells Canyon Dam.

There was also support from some unions, particularly the Railroad brotherhoods and the United Mine Workers of America who agreed that this would also stop injunctions in union cases. Their support was seen as a major reason why Senators in mining states such as West Virginia and mid western Republican senators where the railroads were strong became less hostile to the amendment.

On August 2, 1957, the Senate passed the jury trial amendment with majority support from Democratic members, both Northern and Southern. Following the vote, many Republicans were visible in their bitterness, having failed in an opportunity to spearhead the cause of civil rights against a deceitful, partisan Democratic effort. According to Johnson biographer Robert A. Caro:
Several conservative Republican senators who voted for the Anderson–Aiken amendment on small-government grounds opposed the jury trial amendment for its intent of weakening civil rights efforts. Idaho senator Henry Dworshak decried that it &quot;practically scuttled any hope of getting an effective civil rights bill.&quot;

=== Filibuster ===
Then-Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, an ardent segregationist, sustained the longest one-person filibuster in history in an attempt to keep the bill from becoming law. His one-man filibuster lasted 24 hours and 18 minutes; he began with readings of every US state&#x27;s election laws in alphabetical order. He later read from the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address.

To prevent a quorum call that could have relieved the filibuster by allowing the Senate to adjourn, cots were brought in from a nearby hotel for the legislators to sleep on while Thurmond discussed increasingly irrelevant and obscure topics. Other members of the Southern caucus, who had agreed as part of a compromise not to filibuster this bill, were upset with Thurmond. They believed his defiance made them look incompetent to their constituents. Other constituents were upset with their senators because they were seen as not helping Thurmond.

Thurmond pointed out that there was already a federal statute that prosecuted citizens who denied or intimidated voters at voting booths under a fine and/or imprisonment but that the bill then under consideration could legally deny trial by jury to those that continued to do so.

Democratic Representative Charles A. Boyle of Illinois, a
member of the powerful Appropriations Subcommittee of Defense, pushed the bill through the House of Representatives.

=== Final passage ===
The bill passed 285–126 in the House of Representatives with a majority of both parties&#x27; support (Republicans 167–19, Democrats 118–107). It then passed 72–18 in the Senate, again with a majority of both parties (Republicans 43–0, Democrats 29–18). Despite large opposition from Southern Democrats, the Democratic U.S. Senators from Tennessee and Texas would support the law. President Eisenhower signed the bill on September 9, 1957.

The act established both the Commission on Civil Rights and the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Subsequently, on December 9, 1957, the Civil Rights Division was established within the Justice Department by order of US Attorney General William P. Rogers, giving the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights a distinct division to command. Previously, civil rights lawyers had enforced Reconstruction-era civil rights laws from within the Department&#x27;s Criminal Division.

==Parts==

===Part IEstablishment of the Commission on Civil Rights===

Part I, consisting of sections 101–106, establishes a six-member Civil Rights Commission in the executive branch to gather information on citizens&#x27; deprivation of voting rights based on color, race, religion, or national origin; in addition the legal background, the laws, and the policies of the federal government relating to voting rights. It delineates the procedures, powers, and responsibilities of the commission. The commission was to take testimony or written complaints from individuals on the difficulties in voting registration and denial of voting rights. Required of the commission were periodic reports to congress and the president, as well as a final report within two years, after which it would be disbanded.

===Part IITo Provide for an Additional Assistant Attorney General===
Part II, Section 111 establishes one additional Assistant Attorney General to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate.

===Part IIITo Strengthen the Civil Rights Statuses, and for Other Purposes===
Part III, Section 121 amends title 28, section 1343 of the United States Code to include language about civil rights. Section 122 repeals Section 1989 of 42 U.S.C. 1993.
===Part IVTo Provide Means of Further Securing and Protecting the Right to Vote===
Part IV, Section 131 banned intimidating, coercing or otherwise interfering with the rights of persons to vote for electors for president and members of Congress. The United States attorney general was allowed to institute actions, including injunctions and charges of contempt of court, with fines not to exceed $1,000 and six months imprisonment. Extensive safeguards for the rights of accused were provided by the statute. United States federal judges were allowed to hear cases related to the Act with or without juries.

Not being able to vote in most of the South, blacks were then excluded from state juries there. Federal jury selection had been tied to state jury selection rules, thus in some instances excluding both blacks and women as federal jurors. Section 161 freed federal courts from state jury rules and specified qualifications for jurors in federal courts. &quot;Any citizen&quot; 21 years or older, literate in English, who had resided in the judicial district for a year, excluding convicts and persons with mental or physical infirmities severe enough to make them unable to serve, was eligible. Since neither race nor sex was listed among the qualifications, the provision allowed both blacks and women to serve on juries in trials in federal courts.

===Part VTo Provide Trial by Jury for Proceedings To Punish Criminal Contempts of Court Growing Out of Civil Rights Cases and To Amend the Judicial Code Relating to Federal Jury Qualifications===

Part V consists of sections 151, 152, and 161. Section 151 describes the punitive measures to be taken when a person is found to be in contempt of the committee. Section 152 established federal qualifications for exclusion from a jury, those being: conviction of a crime with in State or Federal court with incarceration over 1 year; inability to read, write, speak, or understand the English language; or incapable through mental or physical disability. Section 161 establishes that the legislation may be cited as the &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1957&quot;.

The act established both the Commission on Civil Rights and the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Subsequently, on December 9, 1957, the Civil Rights Division was established within the Justice Department by order of US Attorney General William P. Rogers, giving the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights a distinct division to command. Previously, civil rights lawyers had enforced Reconstruction-era civil rights laws from within the Department&#x27;s Criminal Division.

==Future Acts==
The Civil Rights Act of 1960 addressed some of the shortcomings of the 1957 Act by expanding the authority of federal judges to protect voting rights and by requiring local authorities to maintain comprehensive voting records so that the government could determine if there were patterns of discrimination against certain populations.

The Civil Rights Movement continued to expand, with protesters leading nonviolent demonstrations for their cause. President John F. Kennedy called for a new bill in his televised Civil Rights Address of June 11, 1963, asking for legislation &quot;giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments&quot; as well as &quot;greater protection for the right to vote&quot;. Kennedy delivered the speech after a series of civil rights protests like the Birmingham campaign, which concluded in May 1963.

In the summer of 1963, parts of the civil rights movement collaborated on voter education and voter registration drives in Mississippi. During the 1964 Freedom Summer, hundreds of students from the North and West participated in voter drives and community organizing. Media coverage, especially of the violent backlash over the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner near Philadelphia, Mississippi, contributed to national support for civil rights legislation.

After the Kennedy assassination, President Lyndon Johnson helped secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made racial discrimination and segregation illegal, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and 24th amendment, which abolished poll taxes and other means of keeping blacks and the poor from registering to vote or from voting, established record-keeping and oversight, and provided for federal enforcement in areas with documented patterns of discrimination or low voter turnout.

==Legacy==
Although the Act&#x27;s passage seemed to indicate a growing federal commitment to the cause of civil rights, its effect was limited. Alterations to the bill made the Act difficult to enforce; by 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%. Its passage showed varying degrees of willingness to support civil rights. The Act restricted itself to protecting participation in federal elections.

Martin Luther King Jr., then 28, was a developing leader in the Civil Rights Movement and spoke out against white supremacists. Segregationists had burned black churches, which were centers of education and organizing for voter registration, and physically attacked black activists. King sent a telegram to Eisenhower to make a speech to the South and asked him to use &quot;the weight of your great office to point out to the people of the South the moral nature of the problem&quot;. Eisenhower responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what another speech would do about the thing right now.&quot;

Disappointed, King sent another telegram to Eisenhower stating that the president&#x27;s comments were &quot;a profound disappointment to the millions of Americans of goodwill, north and south, who earnestly are looking to you for leadership and guidance in this period of inevitable social change&quot;. He tried to set up a meeting with the president but was given a two-hour meeting with Vice President Richard Nixon. It was reported that Nixon was impressed with King and told Eisenhower that he might enjoy meeting King later.

<text>Karate Kid (Val Armorr) is a superhero appearing in the DC Comics universe, primarily as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. He is a master of every form of martial arts to have been developed by the 31st century. The extent of his skill is so great that he can severely damage various types of hard material with a single blow and was briefly able to hold his own against Superboy through what he called &quot;Super Karate&quot;.

Karate Kid has made limited appearances in other media, primarily in association with the Legion. He is voiced by Keith Ferguson in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006) and Dante Basco in &quot;JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time&quot;.

==Publication history==
Karate Kid first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #346 (July 1966) and was created by Jim Shooter. The character appeared in Shooter&#x27;s first published story, along with other new members of the Legion of Super-Heroes: Princess Projectra, Ferro Lad, and Nemesis Kid.

==Fictional character biography==
Val Armorr is the son of Japanese crime lord Kirau Nezumi, also known as Black Dragon. When he was born, his mother, American secret agent Valentina Armorr, tried to hide him from his father, but she failed and was killed for her effort. Japan&#x27;s greatest hero Sensei Toshiaki (White Crane) kills Black Dragon for his crimes, adopts Val, and trains him in martial arts. Following an unsuccessful attempt to impress Toshiaki, Val leaves him and searches the galaxy for new forms of battle to master.

===Legion of Super-Heroes===
When Val returns to Earth, he applies to join the Legion of Super-Heroes, who are searching for recruits to battle the Khunds. Despite lacking powers, he joins the Legion after defeating Superboy in one-on-one combat. He later becomes the Legion&#x27;s leader for one term and falls in love with Princess Projectra.

Karate Kid is later killed in battle with Nemesis Kid and succeeded by Myg. Furthermore, a temporal clone of Karate Kid from &quot;Batch SW6&quot; is introduced in the &quot;Five Years Later&quot; arc.

===1994 reboot===
Karate Kid is resurrected following &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, which reboots the Legion&#x27;s continuity. He joins Leland McCauley&#x27;s Workforce before leaving them and joining the Legion. After the Legion&#x27;s universe is destroyed, Karate Kid is among the Legionnaires who travel the multiverse to find survivors from other universes.
In the &quot;Threeboot&quot;, Karate Kid is a combat trainer for other Legion members.

===One Year Later and Countdown===
In &quot;One Year Later&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, the pre-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; Karate Kid resurfaces and is brainwashed into believing that he is the villain Trident. After being freed from mind control, Karate Kid stays in the 21st century with Una before being killed by the &quot;Morticoccus&quot; virus. Karate Kid is later resurrected and rejoins the Legion.

==Solo series==
The pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; Karate Kid was featured in a 15-issue ongoing series, cover dated March/April 1976 through July/August 1978. It was written primarily by Barry Jameson and Bob Rozakis, with pencils by Ric Estrada and Juan Ortiz.

In the series, Karate Kid attempts to prove to King Voxv of Orando that he is worthy of marrying Princess Projectra. While in the past, he befriends schoolteacher Iris Jacobs and encounters teen heroes Superboy and Robin. He battles numerous villains, including Nemesis Kid, Major Disaster, and the Lord of Time. Eventually, he returns to the 30th century to assist the Legion during &quot;Earthwar&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Karate Kid is a master in every documented form of martial arts. He can sense the weakest spot in an object and damage durable materials such as metal and stone with a single blow.

Furthermore, Karate Kid&#x27;s discipline gives him resistance to mind control and prevents him from feeling pain.

As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Karate Kid is provided a Legion Flight Ring, which allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. He has an extensive collection of weapons, but seldom uses them in combat.

<text>Stanley Griswold (November 14, 1763August 21, 1815) was a Democratic-Republican politician from Ohio. He served in the U.S. Senate.

Born in Torrington, Connecticut, Griswold served in the militia during the Revolutionary War. After graduating from Yale College in 1786, he taught for a time in Norwich, and began studying Theology in 1787. In 1789 he was called to the First Congregational Church in New Milford, Connecticut, where he preached until 1802. In 1803 he went to Walpole, New Hampshire, as editor of the new Democratic newspaper &quot;The Political Observatory&quot;. Griswold continued with the paper until the spring of 1805 when he received the appointment of Secretary to the new Territory of Michigan from President Thomas Jefferson. He served as the first territorial secretary of Michigan Territory from 1805-1808. 
In 1806, while serving as acting governor in the absence of Governor William Hull, Griswold ordered the erection of Fort Croghan, also known as Fort Nonsense, to protect livestock from raids by Native Americans. Griswold Street in Detroit is named in his honor. 
His tenure ended largely due to disagreements with the Governor, who accused Griswold of causing dissension between the Governor and the militia. In January 1808, Griswold lost a trial, which has been characterized as a farce, and was obliged to pay a penalty of $1,000. He left office on March 18, 1808, and moved to Ohio. He was appointed to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Edward Tiffin, serving from May 18, 1809 until a special election was held to choose a successor on December 11, 1809. Griswold then moved to the Illinois Territory, where he was appointed as a federal judge, serving on the bench and as a lawyer until his death.

<text>Dongguan, alternately romanized via Cantonese as Tungkun, is a prefecture-level city in central Guangdong Province, China. An important industrial city in the Pearl River Delta, Dongguan borders the provincial capital of Guangzhou to the north, Huizhou to the northeast, Shenzhen to the south, and the Pearl River to the west. It is part of the Pearl River Delta built-up (or metro) area with more than 65.57 million inhabitants as of the 2020 census spread over nine municipalities across an area of .

Dongguan&#x27;s city administration is considered especially progressive in seeking foreign direct investment. Dongguan ranks behind only Shenzhen, Shanghai and Suzhou in exports among Chinese cities, with $65.54 billion in shipments. It is also home to one of the world&#x27;s largest shopping malls, the New South China Mall, which is seeing increased activity. Although the city is geographically and thus culturally Cantonese in the Weitou form and as well as culturally Hakka in the prefectures of Fenggang and Qingxi, the majority of the modern-day population speaks Mandarin due to the large influx of economic migrants from other parts of China. The city is home to several universities, including Guangdong University of Science and Technology, Guangdong Medical University and Dongguan University of Technology.

== Economy ==
In the Pearl River Delta region Dongguan was the first urban area where joint production was implemented between village collectives, local Chinese Communist Party cadre, and foreign investors. In the 1990s this type of enterprise accounted for around 20 percent of all foreign direct investments and approximately 50 percent of exports by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

Today Dongguan is a major manufacturing hub, although it suffered significant loss of economic activity from the impact of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The largest industrial sector is manufacturing of electronics and communications equipment; international companies with facilities in Dongguan include DuPont, Samsung Electronics, Nokia, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Maersk.

The Dongguan Science and Technology Museum opened in December 2005 and is the high tech commerce park in the Songshan Lake district, which opened in 2003. The museum is a partnership with the Global IT Academy of the Brea Olinda Unified School District in Southern California, demonstrating the city&#x27;s emphasis on attracting technology business. The city announced in 2005 a planned investment of US$500 million over five years for technology infrastructure improvements. The city administration is considered especially progressive in seeking foreign direct investment. Among the investors were Brazilian shoe manufacturers. Brazil excelled in manufacturing cheap footwear in the 1970s and 80s. The Brazilian community in Dongguan numbered 4,000 people in 2013.

While the city is the fourth largest export region in China, behind Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Suzhou, Dongguan has yet to gain the kind of name recognition realized by Shenzhen outside of China. This may be because the city has focused on infrastructure investment rather than the direct targeting of major corporations with financial incentives for economic development. Nevertheless, Dongguan has been identified by high level representatives of the National Development and Reform Commission of the central government as one of the most significant growth regions for technology in the coming years. As part of this plan, the Dongguan local government announced a plan to create and support a 100-billion-yuan photovoltaic manufacturing industry by 2015.

To cope with the impact of the financial crisis, Dongguan city is looking to industrial restructuring, focusing on &quot;four pillar platforms&quot;, these are governmental services, supporting measures, technology upgrade, and market expansion. The city government claims that this process has already enhanced its capability for independent innovation and the quantity of patent applications in 2008.

Dongguan was known as China&#x27;s “Sin City”, where prostitution once thrived. But authorities have attempted to eradicate prostitution in the city.

On 9 February 2014 China Central Television aired a special on the sex industry in Dongguan. The same day Guangdong Provincial Police raided and closed all saunas, bars, foot massages, karaokes, and other businesses associated with the sex industry. The economic impact of this crackdown is believed to be 50 billion yuan, or just over $8 billion US dollars. The residual effects of the crackdown affected the livelihood of taxi drivers and restaurants who, while not directly involved in the sex industry, benefited from the increased clientele.

The city ranked 13th in Forbes China&#x27;s listing of the most innovative mainland cities, as well as 18th in &quot;Foreign Policy&#x27;s&quot; listing of the most dynamic cities in the world.

== History ==

The earliest traces of human habitation in the area stretch back 5,000 years. In 1839, at the outset of the First Opium War, large quantities of seized opium were destroyed in Humen, a town that now belongs to Dongguan. Several of the major battles of the war were fought in this area.

During the Second World War, the city served as the base for guerrilla resistance against the occupation that came with the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Being a district of the Huiyang prefecture before, as its economy overshadowed the prefectural capital of Huizhou itself, Dongguan earned city status in 1985, and was upgraded to prefecture city status three years later. During this period the city changed its focus from an agricultural town into a manufacturing hub, with an average annual growth of up to 18 percent.

== Geography ==

==Demographics==
Dongguan had an estimated 6,949,800 inhabitants at the end of 2008, among whom 1,748,700 were local residents and 5,201,100 permanent migrants from other parts of the country. At the 2010 Census the population had expanded to 8,220,237. The number reached 10.5 million by 2020.

Dongguan is the hometown for many overseas Chinese, the family origin of over 700,000 people in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and over 200,000 Chinese nationals living abroad.

==Administration==
Dongguan is a prefecture-level city of the Guangdong province. An uncommon administrative feature is that it has no county-level division, but the municipal government does group the 32 township-level divisions into six district areas. The city government directly administers four Subdistricts and 28 towns:

People can also choose to drive between Hong Kong and Dongguan. With the permitted business license plate and driver license, people can drive through the customs located at Shenzhen so that to get to Hong Kong. Normally, it takes three hours for driving. In 2018, G4 Expressway (Beijing - Hong Kong and Macau Expressway) was opened, and Dongguan is one of the cities that G4 Expressway approaches. This benefits people from Dongguan to travel to those cities on G4 Expressway.

Rail services in and out of the city call at Dongguan railway station where there are direct train services to Guangzhou East railway station in Guangzhou; and Hung Hom railway station in Hong Kong. High-speed rail services are also available at Humen railway station.

Among the four metro lines (Line 1-Line 4) planned for the Dongguan Rail Transit, Line 2 was scheduled to open for operations in early 2015. This was delayed and opened in May 2016. Line 2 will link towns in Western Dongguan, thereby promoting the connection of the entire downtown area with Houjie, Humen and Chang&#x27;an. It will also support Dongguan&#x27;s regional transportation with other cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong by joining with the rail transit junctions of the Pearl River Delta.

Dongguan Yulan Theater is one of China&#x27;s newest multipurpose performing arts venues. With its multi-layered exterior suggestive of an unfolding lotus petal, it has become a landmark in Dongguan city. The new cultural hub houses two theaters presenting a full schedule of performances, including Romeo and Juliet and the Chinese classic Butterfly Lovers. So far Dongguan has produced seven original musicals by its own and made a roadshow of 60 performances in over 30 cities of China.

==Social issues==
The city and province have been the recent focus of press and journalist attention with coverage of the many young Chinese workers, principally females (so-called &quot;factory girls&quot;), from agricultural areas who work in the area&#x27;s factories and manufacturing/assembly facilities, where many are housed in large dormitories, usually several to a room.

An article in the &quot;High Tech Misery in China&quot; series reports research conducted, over 2008 to 2009, on working conditions at one of the city&#x27;s major keyboard makers (Dongguan Meitai Plastics &amp; Electronics Factory); in it, Meitai factory won some unwanted attention due to the poor conditions for its young, mostly female workers. The article includes details of those conditions, photos, translations of employer&#x27;s rules and evidence that well-known computer brands use this keyboard supplier&#x27;s products.

Also, Dongguan has built a notoriety within China for its various types of brothels, massage parlors, nightclubs, sauna centers and karaoke bars. The city had more than 120 top-end luxury hotels and hundreds of other mid-range places that offer illegal sexual services or lease floors to sex operators, and many parts of the broader service sector benefit from the trade brought by visitors. Although much of the business is illegal, police operations to limit these activities were for a long time largely ineffective, in part because corrupt members of the local administration and other officials have business interests in the sector. On 9February 2014, CCTV aired a report about prostitution in Dongguan. In reaction, on the same day, Dongguan police launched a crackdown on brothels, massage parlors, nightclubs, sauna centres and karaoke bars, leading to some commentary that the city&#x27;s days as China&#x27;s sex capital were numbered.

==Education==
The city is home to 650 educational institutions: one general college, a TV University as well as technical and vocational schools, 550 primary schools and 480 kindergartens. Also, Dongguan is home to a wide range of international schools due to the large expat community.

The number of professional teachers, including those at kindergartens, totals 20,268. A comparatively integrated educational system has been set up including preschool, basic, vocational, higher and lifelong adult education. Senior high school education has developed since 1995.

The Dongguan University of Technology is located in Dongguan.

<text>Mount Wood (sometimes referred to as Wood Peak) is the seventh-highest mountain in Canada and is located in Kluane National Park and Reserve. In 1900 it was named by the surveyor James J. McArthur (1856–1925) after Zachary Taylor Wood (d.1915), a North-West Mounted Police inspector in Dawson during the Klondike Gold Rush. He was later the commissioner of the NWMP.

<doc id="713749" wikidata="Q3955380" url="?curid=713749" title="Princess Projectra">
<text>Princess Projectra (later Sensor Girl) is a fictional character, a superheroine in the DC Comics universe. Typically portrayed as a haughty member of an alien royal family, she is from the 30th and 31st centuries and is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

Projectra was one of Jim Shooter&#x27;s early creations on Legion of Super Heroes that helped cement his place in history as one of the seminal creators for the Legion. Shooter sold the original script in which Projectra debuted to DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger when Shooter was only 14 years old.

==Publication history==
In 1965, when he was just 13 years old, Jim Shooter submitted an unsolicited script to DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger. Weisinger was so impressed, he asked Shooter to send in another script. Shooter created a short origin story for Princess Projectra and several other characters and sent it in. Weisinger purchased all of these, and immediately started giving him writing assignments.

Shooter&#x27;s Projectra story first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #346 (July 1966) (&quot;One of Us Is a Traitor&quot;), when Shooter was 14 years old. The character later resigned from the Legion of Superheroes, and left the title, though later Legionnaire writer Paul Levitz had always intended to bring her back to the series in some form.

In 1985, in the &quot;Who Is Sensor Girl?&quot; storyline, a new character &quot;Sensor Girl&quot; was introduced. This character was fully masked, and when eventually unmasked, turned out to have been Projectra the whole time.

Sensor Girl&#x27;s true identity was unknown to the other characters in the story and even to some of the creators on the title. Penciller Steve Lightle, who created Sensor Girl&#x27;s costume, had no idea the character was supposed to be Princess Projectra, and believed her to be Supergirl. It is believed Levitz came up with the idea that Sensor Girl was Projectra significantly far into the development process of the story.

After this story line, she returned to her &quot;Projectra&quot; identity, but the character&#x27;s most enduring association is arguably with this brief interlude as a mystery character.

Starting in the July 2019 series &quot;Legion of Super Heroes: Millennium&quot;, the character received a significant visual re-design.

==Fictional character biography==
Projectra (often called by her nickname &quot;Jeckie&quot;, a shortened form of her name) is a member of the royal family of the planet Orando, and possesses the superhuman ability to generate illusions affecting all five senses. Following the death of her father King Voxv, Projectra battles her cousin Pharoxx and grandmother Hagga, who seek to usurp the throne. Afterward, she becomes queen and a reserve Legion member. She later leaves the Legion after Nemesis Kid kills her lover Karate Kid, and renounces her position as queen.
A temporal clone of Princess Projectra from &quot;Batch SW6&quot; appears in the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;. She serves as a member of the Legion before being killed by the Dominators&#x27; troops.

Princess Projectra is erased from existence following the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; continuity reboot and replaced with Sensor.

===Threeboot===
In the &quot;Threeboot&quot;, Projectra is initially an ally and sponsor of the Legion. After Orando is destroyed, Projectra blames the Legion and seeks revenge against them. Furthermore, she gains the ability to manipulate the emotions of others.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
In the pages of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #6, the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Sensor Girl returns. She is trapped in the past before Dawnstar rescues her and restores her memories using the code word &quot;Lightning Lad&quot;. Following this, Sensor Girl returns to her time before traveling to the 21st century to save the future in &quot;Last Stand of New Krypton&quot;.

== In other media ==
Princess Projectra appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>The National Provincial Championship (NPC) is an annual, men&#x27;s round-robin rugby union competition organised by New Zealand Rugby. First played in 1976, it is the second highest level of professional rugby in New Zealand. The Ranfurly Shield is also played for during the season. In 2021, Bunnings became the naming rights sponsor and the competition has been known as the Bunnings NPC since. A concurrent women&#x27;s tournament is also held, called the Farah Palmer Cup.

Following the 2005 season the league was restructured into a two-tier competition. The National Provincial Championship would include professional and semi-professional players, and consist of the top fourteen financial and sporting best performing regional teams. For sponsorship reasons it was rebranded as the Air New Zealand Cup. The remaining teams would form an amateur competition known as the Heartland Championship.

Twenty-nine teams have competed since the inception of the competition in 1976. Auckland are historically the most successful union with seventeen titles and Canterbury is the most successful team during the professional-era, having won nine from eleven finals. Eight other teams have won titles from both periods: Wellington (6), Waikato (3), Otago (2), Taranaki (2), Tasman (2), Bay of Plenty (1), Counties Manukau (1) and Manawatu (1).

== History ==
=== Origins and foundation ===

The first form of competition came in 1904 with the introduction of the Ranfurly Shield as a challenge trophy. Each year, fixtures were arranged in Wellington during the annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, where an elected representative from each provincial union would propose dates and opponents that ideally avoided conflicts with local club competitions. Across the country, neighbouring regions organised regular matches for challenge trophies. One of the most prestigious competitions, the Hanan Shield, was established in 1946 by Timaru&#x27;s former mayor, A.E.S. Hanan, and was contested by Mid Canterbury, South Canterbury, and North Otago. Another significant trophy, the Seddon Shield, was first challenged in 1906. Named after former New Zealand premier Richard Seddon, it featured representative teams from Buller, Nelson Bays, Marlborough, and the West Coast. In the North Island, starting in the King Country and moving north, eleven teams competed for the Coronation Shield.

Given the numerous competitions across New Zealand, there was a clear need for a national tournament. In 1972, Barry Smith proposed an inter-provincial competition to the Auckland Rugby Union. After gaining approval, the proposal was brought to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union&#x27;s annual conference in early 1974. It included an overview of the scheme, addressing finance, travel, sponsorship opportunities, implications for club and sub-union competitions, traditional representative matches, international laws and Sunday play. Following discussions in October 1975, modifications were made and ultimately accepted by all provinces. Radio New Zealand secured sponsorship rights worth NZD 100,000 and helped market the new competition, later joined by Lion Breweries, National Mutual, and Air New Zealand.

Teams were divided into two divisions based on their performance over the previous five years. The premier division included Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, Counties, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, North Auckland, Otago, Southland, and Wellington, determined by a ranking system. The remaining provinces, Buller, East Coast, Horowhenua, King Country, Mid Canterbury, Nelson Bays, North Otago, Poverty Bay, South Canterbury, Taranaki, Thames Valley, Waikato, Wairarapa Bush, Wanganui and the West Coast were split into North Island and South Island sub-divisions, with the potential for promotion to the top division.

=== Auckland dynasty ===
Between 1980 and the early 2000s, Auckland experienced a golden era, dominating competitions and consistently retaining the Ranfurly Shield. During this time, they reached eighteen finals, finishing as runners-up multiple times, and secured over half of the available competition titles, totaling fifteen. This remarkable run included a record sixty-one Ranfurly Shield defenses, five South Pacific Championship titles, and recognition as the Halberg Awards Team of the Year in 1992.

Canterbury emerged as the only team to consistently challenge Auckland&#x27;s supremacy, with several matches becoming historic. The 1985 clash, where Auckland ended Canterbury&#x27;s record-equalling streak of twenty-five matches, was famously dubbed the &quot;Match of the Century.&quot; In front of a record crowd of 52,000 at Lancaster Park, Canterbury nearly staged a stunning comeback from a 24–0 half-time deficit, but Auckland held on to win 28–23, setting a new benchmark with sixty-one consecutive defences over eight years.

However, Auckland&#x27;s fortunes waned with the professionalisation of rugby, officially declared in August 1995. The introduction of Super 12 in 1996 marked the end of their dominance as many international players became unavailable. Notable stars like Sean Fitzpatrick, who captained the All Blacks and played 154 games for Auckland, and Grant Fox, who set a record for the most shield points (932), were pivotal during this era, along with John Kirwan, who scored forty-four tries.

=== Turning professional ===
After the 2005 season, the league underwent a restructuring to create a two-tier competition. The National Provincial Championship would now feature both professional and semi-professional players, comprising the top fourteen financially viable and high-performing regional teams. For sponsorship purposes, it was rebranded as the Air New Zealand Cup, while the remaining teams formed an amateur competition called the Heartland Championship.

This restructuring followed a review conducted by the New Zealand Rugby Union in November 2003, which prioritised issues related to the professional and amateur provincial games, including timing, costs, and the roles of the NZRU, Super 12 franchises and provincial unions in the sport&#x27;s management. By December 2005, the final pools and draws for the inaugural Air New Zealand Cup were established, with the season commencing in late July. The fourteen participating teams were Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, Counties Manukau, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, North Harbour, Northland, Otago, Southland, Taranaki, Tasman, Waikato, and Wellington.

The competition format included two pools with a two-round system, followed by a finals series consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. Teams competed based on their rankings from the first round, forming a top six pool and a bottom eight repechage in the second round. The top two teams from the repechage joined the top six teams in the quarterfinals. The pools were determined by seedings from the 2005 National Provincial Championship.

Following the inaugural season, the New Zealand Rugby Union held a meeting to evaluate the tournament&#x27;s success and gather feedback from stakeholders and provincial unions. It was confirmed that the fourteen teams would remain for the 2007 season, though the format would be adjusted. The new structure included seven matches each week during a ten-week modified round robin, followed by quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Notably, this modified round robin did not require all teams to compete against one another, as a formula was established to determine which teams would not face each other based on their performance from the previous season.

=== Canterbury dominance ===

Canterbury had a remarkable run in the National Provincial Championship from 2008 to 2018, winning the title nine times and cementing their position as one of New Zealand&#x27;s premier provincial teams. This success stemmed from a strong focus on player development, with many players going on to represent the All Blacks. The 2008 season marked the beginning of Canterbury&#x27;s unprecedented dynasty, which continued until their streak was broken by Auckland in the 2018 final. They became the first team to win six consecutive titles after defeating Wellington in 2013 and also retained the Ranfurly Shield three times during this era.

During this period, Canterbury produced over twenty international players, more than any other province in New Zealand. Centurions such as Owen Franks and Sam Whitelock, along with other notable talents like Wyatt Crockett, Sonny Bill Williams, Codie Taylor and Richie Mo&#x27;unga, all began their careers with Canterbury. Each of these players made significant contributions to the All Blacks, with many playing over fifty test matches.

Few teams could match Canterbury&#x27;s dominance until their neighbouring province, Tasman, became competitive and gained promotion in 2013. This led to the end of Canterbury&#x27;s six-championship winning streak, as Tasman convincingly defeated them in the 2014 semi-final at Trafalgar Park. Ireland international James Lowe and former All Black Jimmy Cowan both scored tries, converted by Marty Banks, securing a memorable 26–6 victory. Canterbury also lost to Tasman during the round-robin phase of that season. The rivalry continued, with the two teams meeting again in the finals of 2016 and 2017, where Canterbury emerged victorious.

=== Renaming and newcomers ===

In April 2021, Bunnings, a hardware and retail store, became the new sponsor of the competition, leading to the name&#x27;s return to the National Provincial Championship for the first time since the 2005 season. Additionally, the Rugby Cup was reintroduced as the competition&#x27;s trophy after being replaced by three other trophies between 2006 and 2021. Following a further review by New Zealand Rugby, the competition format was also restructured, allowing fourteen teams to compete for a single title, eliminating the divisions that had been in place since the 2010 season.

Beyond the traditional Super Rugby bases of Auckland, Canterbury, Otago, Waikato and Wellington, only two other provinces have achieved notable success during the professional era, Taranaki and Tasman. Their rise began with their matchup in the 2014 final, where Taranaki claimed their first national title in history with a thrilling 36–32 victory. This marked the first time a provincial union outside the big five had won the premiership title since 1980.

Since then, both teams have secured the title twice, with Taranaki also holding the Ranfurly Shield on two occasions and Tasman winning it for the first time in 2024. During this era, notable All Blacks such as the Barrett brothers, Beauden, Jordie, and New Zealand captain Scott all represented Taranaki, while Tasman boasted talents like Will Jordan, one of the country&#x27;s leading international try scorers, and Ireland international James Lowe.

== Teams ==

The fourteen provincial unions that have participated in the current National Provincial Championship since its founding in 2006 are listed below. Ten teams are situated in the North Island and four teams in the South Island.

The NPC, which comes after Super Rugby and international rugby, constitutes the &quot;third tier&quot; of rugby union in New Zealand. Below this tier are numerous club competitions, which are organised by each provincial union.

With the creation of two distinct provincial competitions in 2006, thirteen teams, together with the newly established Tasman Rugby Union, remained in the newly restructured competition. The remainder formed an amateur competition called the Heartland Championship. The teams who were chosen to stay were reorganised to play professionally. In order for the area to field a squad for the 2006 season, Tasman was established in December 2005. This became the newest provincial union in New Zealand, having been created through the amalgamation of Nelson Bays and Marlborough Rugby Union.

Another one of New Zealand&#x27;s newest provincial rugby unions, North Harbour was founded in 1985, which was followed by Tasman. After North Harbour being promoted to the first division in 1987, they entered the National Provincial Championship by taking first place in the third division in its inaugural year. While the former competition received further additional participants such as the Central Vikings, another two unions underwent name changes throughout its time. In 1994, the 1920-founded North Auckland Rugby Union changed its name to Northland. South Auckland Counties was established with full union status in 1955. The following year, the name was abbreviated to Counties, and in 1996 the organisation changed its name to Counties Manukau.

Following a review conducted after the 2007 season, New Zealand Rugby declared Northland and Tasman might be removed from the competition due to widespread support for a smaller Air New Zealand Cup. However, after members unanimously decided to keep the fourteen-team structure, both teams appealed the decision to be eliminated and won their case. But their existence at top level was conditional upon them meeting further requirements. The relationship between the Nelson and Marlborough unions, which broke down the previous year, needed to be repaired and kept together by Tasman. Additionally, they had to persuade the NZR of their financial viability and begin making payments on a loan they had received from the organisation worth NZD 340,000. Furthermore, Northland had to make governance changes that include a new chief executive and the current board had to resign, seeking a re-election.

: One of the two home fields used by the Bay of Plenty Rugby Union is the Tauranga Domain. It serves as both their main stadium and training facility, with the Rotorua International Stadium serving as a temporary location for the occasional fixture.
: Home matches for the Tasman Rugby Union alternate between Blenheim and Nelson. Their main training facility is located at Trafalgar Park, where their headquarters is located in the vicinity. An alternative host for games is Lansdowne Park.
== Structure and finances ==
=== Format ===
In December 2005, the final pools and draws for the inaugural Air New Zealand Cup were made. The competition was established as a result of a thorough competitions review conducted by the New Zealand Rugby Union. The season started at the end of July, and fourteen teams participated. Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Canterbury, Counties Manukau, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, North Harbour, Northland, Otago, Southland, Taranaki, Tasman, Waikato, and Wellington were the teams that were revealed. A two-pool, two-round competition in which the unions participated was followed by a finals round including quarterfinal, semifinal, and final matches. Based on first-round rankings, teams competed in a top-six pool and a bottom-eight repechage in the second round. The top two teams from the repechage joined the top-six teams in the quarterfinals. Pools were based on the seedings at the end of the 2005 National Provincial Championship.

The New Zealand Rugby Union conducted a meeting after the inaugural season to assess how well the tournament went in its first year and to seek formal feedback from its stakeholders and the provincial unions. The meeting&#x27;s conclusion confirmed that the fourteen teams currently playing would remain for the 2007 season. Later, it was revealed that the format would be altered, with seven matches being played each week during a ten-week modified round robin, followed by quarterfinals, semifinals, and final matches. The modified round robin didn&#x27;t have all teams playing one another. This was based on a team&#x27;s performance in competition during the previous season. A formula was established to determine which teams did not play each other.

=== Sponsorship ===

The competition was known as the Air New Zealand Cup from 2006 to 2009. Air New Zealand, the national carrier of New Zealand, held the naming rights during that time. It was announced in March 2010 that the building suppliers&#x27; cooperative ITM, which is owned by New Zealand, would sponsor the tournament from 2010 to 2012. Air New Zealand opted to give up their sponsorship rights in order to concentrate their efforts on helping the New Zealand national men&#x27;s team.

ITM continued owning sponsorship naming rights until another bidder beat them for the 2016 season. The Heartland Championship was also backed by the business. It was referred to as the ITM Cup during its existence. However, they wished to extend their sponsorship once their agreement expired in 2015. ITM submitted a bid, however the New Zealand Rugby Union informed them that it had not been accepted. ITM was not given the opportunity to match the new sponsor&#x27;s investment, and no explanation as to why it was overlooked for both competitions the following year.

New Zealand owned home improvement and garden retailer, Mitre 10 took over sponsorship in 2016 after they were announced the new title sponsor for the national domestic rugby union competition. With the inclusion of the Farah Palmer Cup, and support of the Jock Hobbs Memorial National Under-19 tournament, Mitre 10 became the first sponsor of all major fifteens domestic rugby competitions in New Zealand.

Bunnings assumed sponsorship of the tournament on a three-year arrangement prior to the 2021 season, changing the competition&#x27;s name back to the National Provincial Championship. The Bunnings NPC would be the official name of the competition. Additionally, Bunnings would support the Heartland Championship, Super Rugby Aotearoa Under-20 competition and the Farah Palmer Cup.

In March 2024, the NPC signed a 4-year sponsorship deal with insurance firm Gallagher as an &quot;official national partner&quot; which sees their logo displayed on team jerseys, in stadiums and during televised matches.

=== Salary cap ===
The preliminary determination on a proposed salary cap from the Commerce Commission was made public in March 2006, according to the New Zealand Rugby Union. The organisation declared that it was confident that the pay cap restrictions would bring benefits to the public that would offset any reduction in competition. This was contingent upon the pay cap being strong and strictly enforced. The hiring of Craig Neil and Cameron Good to the positions of manager and advisor for the salary cap was later confirmed by Steve Tew. Along with the announcement, it was stated that each of the fourteen teams was permitted to spend up to two million NZD annually on player salaries and other benefits.

The Commerce Commission was considering overturning its ruling that allowed the New Zealand Rugby Union to impose player movement restrictions and a salary cap. The NZRU modified its employment policies between the 2006 and 2011 seasons, classifying all players as employees rather than independent contractors. Since all of the professional athletes were employed, the Commerce Act did not apply and there was no violation of the Act&#x27;s anti-competitive provisions. As a result, the Commission thought about overturning its judgement.

Information about player salaries and the salary limit was made public in 2015. It was revealed that no matter if a player participates in a single game or not, the minimum worth of any contract is NZD 18,000 and that sum counts towards the salary cap. No union can spend more than a little over one million on salaries. Any individual contract cannot be worth more than NZD 55,000 per season. The NZRU pays provincial unions $50,000 for each contracted New Zealand international they have on file that participates in a World Cup. The union is required to reimburse the NZRU a pro rata sum if that player becomes available for any reason in order to have access to that athlete. Internationals who are unable to play because of test obligations are not subject to the salary cap.

== Champions ==
The winner of the National Provincial Championship final match is awarded the NPC Trophy. The semi-final victor with the highest seed receives home field advantage and hosts the NPC final. In 2006, Waikato defeated Wellington to become the first province to win the competition following its reorganisation after the 2005 season. 

Prior to the tournament undergoing a redesign in 2006, the previous competition was split into three divisions, with promotion and relegation between the divisions. The promotion and relegation structure was reintroduced in 2011 (between the Premiership and Championship) until being removed after the 2021 season. The winner of the Premiership was crowned the competition&#x27;s champion, whereas the winner of the Championship was elevated to the Premiership in order to compete for the title. Nine teams were promoted over this time. Bay of Plenty, Counties Manukau, Manawatu, North Harbour, Taranaki, Tasman, Waikato and Wellington had once all received promotion, whereas Hawke&#x27;s Bay had been promoted on three different occasions.

With nine titles, Canterbury leads all other teams in final victories; Auckland, Tasman, Taranaki, Waikato and Wellington each have two. The most final appearances of eleven and most consecutive appearances with six in a row from 2008 to 2013 belong to Canterbury. From 2006 to 2009, Wellington was the only other team to make at least four straight appearances. Wellington has also lost a record number of six finals compared to Tasman&#x27;s four, Auckland&#x27;s three, Waikato&#x27;s two and Canterbury&#x27;s two. The only union with a flawless record is Taranaki, which won their two finals appearance in 2014 and 2023.

=== Finals appearances by union ===
In the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by season of first appearance.

=== Second-tier champions ===
For the 2011 season, three midweek games were agreed upon by all provincial teams in a one-off arrangement to accommodate an expanded Super 15 and the Rugby World Cup. The entire competition would be played over eight weeks, reduced from twelve. The final was held the week before the World Cup began; there were no semifinals. This was necessary because, according to IRB regulations, the World Cup host was required to cease all domestic rugby action a fortnight or more before the beginning of the competition in order to give all venues enough time to display their sponsors&#x27; logos. The brand-new two division format was introduced at this time. Those placed from first to seventh made up the Premiership after the 2010 ITM Cup, and teams ranked eighth to fourteenth made up the Championship. Each team would play four crossover games in addition to every other team in their division.

The Premiership and Championship division structures were removed after the 2021 season, returning all fourteen teams to compete for a single title. This was partly because teams had requested a change to the current structure and desired that every side have the opportunity to compete for the championship. Andrew Thompson, the chairman of the Taranaki Rugby Football Union board, collaborated with the other provinces to provide a new format to the NZR.

Only two teams, Auckland and Canterbury, haven&#x27;t competed in the Championship tier. Northland and Otago, on the other hand, have both participated in the Championship each year. Only one side, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, has won the Championship more than once, their 2020 victory adding to their 2011 and 2015 successes. Of the twelve teams that have participated in the Championship, there have been eight different winners. With the exception of Taranaki in its final season, no Championship team has ever won each of its four crossover matches in a single season.

== Honours ==
The inaugural trophy was first displayed at the tournaments&#x27; launch at Auckland&#x27;s Mt Smart Stadium in July 2006. It was also stated that it would be on display for the general public to witness during the competition&#x27;s opening game, which was played in Napier between Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Canterbury. Thorkild Hansen, the son of Jens Hoyer Hansen, crafted the trophy by hand. Black basalt from the Bombay Hills was used to create the polished stone base by Waihi stone carver Jeff Beckwith. The 45-centimeter-tall cup was constructed of 2.7 kilograms of sterling silver and weighed 3.9 kilograms.

=== Ranfurly Shield ===
The Ranfurly Shield, colloquially known as the Log o&#x27; Wood, is perhaps the most prestigious trophy in New Zealand&#x27;s domestic rugby union competition. First presented to Auckland in 1902, the Shield is based on a challenge system, rather than a league or knockout competition as with most football trophies. The holding union must defend the Shield in challenge matches, and a successful challenger becomes the new holder of the Shield. The Shield holder at the end of each season is required to accept at least seven challenges for the following year. All home games during the regular season, but not during knockout playoffs, in the NPC or Heartland Championship are automatic challenges. The remaining Shield defences must be made up of challenges from unions in the other domestic competition. For example, since North Harbour, an Air New Zealand Cup team, held the Shield at the end of the 2006 season despite losing their home quarter-final to Otago, they were forced to defend the Shield against two Heartland Championship teams during the 2007 pre-season, since they had only five home games scheduled in the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup regular season, which they did against Thames Valley and Horowhenua Kapiti. Having successfully done so, all their home fixtures in the round-robin phase were Shield defences until they lost the shield to Waikato. The Shield continues to change hands throughout the regular season; to continue the 2007 example, the week after gaining the Shield from North Harbour, Otago lost at home to Canterbury, who held the Shield until losing at home in the final week of the regular season to Auckland; hence, at the end of the 2007 season, Auckland held the Shield. The Shield is currently held by , who claimed it from on 6 October 2024.

=== Inter-union trophies ===
=== Player awards ===
The Duane Monkley medal, named in honour of the legendary Waikato player who played 135 games for the province between 1987 and 1996, was unveiled by New Zealand Rugby in 2017. The player of the year award is decided by a season-points system. Match officials choose their players of the match and award three points, two points, and one point for the game&#x27;s top three performers. Prior to 2017, it was simply given to the best player during the season and was selected by a committee of committee members, retired players and media representatives.

<text>In offset printing, a spot color or solid color is any color generated by an ink (pure or mixed) that is printed using a &quot;single run&quot;, whereas a process color is produced by printing a series of dots of different colors. 

The widespread offset-printing process is composed of the four spot colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) commonly referred to as CMYK. More advanced processes involve the use of six spot colors (hexachromatic process), which add orange and green to the process (termed CMYKOG). The two additional spot colors are added to compensate for the ineffective reproduction of faint tints using CMYK colors only. However, offset technicians around the world use the term &quot;spot color&quot; to mean any color generated by a non-standard offset ink; such as metallic, fluorescent, or custom hand-mixed inks. 

When making a multi-color print with a spot color process, every spot color needs its own lithographic film. All the areas of the same spot color are printed using the same film, hence, using the same lithographic plate. The dot gain, hence the screen angle and line frequency, of a spot color vary according to its intended purpose. Spot lamination and UV coatings are sometimes referred to as &#x27;spot colors&#x27;, as they share the characteristics of requiring a separate lithographic film and print run.

== Computer methods ==
There are various methods to incorporate rather sophisticated patterns of spot colors in the final prepress artwork. Software applications such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, QuarkXPress and Scribus may generate spot colors as additional channels. Adobe Photoshop can also be used to generate soft edges (widely known as feathered edges) of spot colors. The dissolve effect provided by Adobe Photoshop layer patterns can be generated for any spot color.

== Optimizing usage ==
Generally the cost and potential for problems for a print job increase as one adds more spot colors, due to the increased cost and complexity of added process inks and films, and requiring more runs per finished print. However, because of the complicated process, spot colors are effective at preventing forgeries of money, passports, bonds and other important documents. Money printing for example, uses secret formulae of spot colors, some of which can be seen by the naked eye and some that can only be seen by using special lights or applying certain chemicals.

== Classification ==
Spot color classification has led to thousands of discrete colors being given unique names or numbers. There are several industry standards in the classification of spot color systems, such as:
* Pantone, the dominant spot color printing system in the United States and Europe.
* Toyo, a common spot color system in Japan.
* DIC Color System Guide, another spot color system common in Japan – it is based on Munsell color theory.
* ANPA, a palette of 300 colors specified by the American Newspaper Publishers Association for spot color usage in newspapers.
* GCMI, a standard for color used in package printing developed by the Glass Packaging Institute (formerly known as the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute, hence the abbreviation).
* HKS is a color system which contains 120 spot colors and 3,250 tones for coated and uncoated paper. HKS is an abbreviation of three German color manufacturers: Hostmann-Steinberg Druckfarben, Kast + Ehinger Druckfarben and H. Schmincke &amp; Co.
* RAL is a color matching system used in Europe. The so-called RAL CLASSIC system is mainly used for varnish and powder coating.
Because each color system creates their own colors from scratch, spot colors from one system may be impossible to find within the library of another.

<doc id="713760" wikidata="Q4781667" url="?curid=713760" title="Apponequet Regional High School">
<text>Apponequet Regional High School (informally known as Apponequet or ARHS), located at 100 Howland Road in Lakeville, Massachusetts opened September 21, 1959. Apponequet serves secondary academic education students from the towns of Freetown, and Lakeville. It is the only high school within the Freetown-Lakeville Regional School District.

== History ==

In the early 20th century many small towns in Massachusetts sent their older students to other cities&#x27; or towns&#x27; high schools on a tuition basis to avoid the cost of building and maintaining their own secondary facility. As towns with high schools grew, they became unable to provide tuition spaces, needing the space for their own students. This created the need for more high schools, as tuition contracts slowly began to expire and not be renewed.

The communities of Freetown, Berkley, Carver, Lakeville, and Rochester, Massachusetts formed a planning committee for a regional high school, as each town needed a location for its secondary school students. Carver dropped from the board in 1955 after forming a region with Plymouth, and the remaining towns voted. Freetown and Lakeville approved the school, while Berkley and Rochester did not. Berkley would go on to form a tuition agreement with Somerset, and Rochester formed a region with Marion and Mattapoisett (Old Rochester Regional).

On April 8, 1957, town meetings were held in Freetown and Lakeville on the issue of the two towns building and operating a high school together. The vote in Freetown was 140–22 in favor, and in Lakeville 160–90, also in favor.

Freetown appropriated $20,347 for the preliminary planning of the school, and Lakeville appropriated $18,152 as its share. Land for the school was given by Paul Leonard and Frank Mello on Howland Road in Lakeville. On September 10, 1957, Israel T. Almy, a Fall River architect used for the original Freetown Consolidated Elementary School, was selected as the architect for the school. Charles Sawyer was chosen to be the first principal for the school.

Apponequet Regional Jr./Sr. High School opened on September 21, 1959, with an initial enrollment of 610 students in grades 7 through 12, including students from Freetown and Lakeville and tuition students from Berkley and Middleboro. The facility originally housed a vocational school, the Apponequet Regional Vocational High School, in addition to the current academic program. Apponequet&#x27;s vocational program admitted students in grades 9–12. Phased out in the early 1990s in favor of sending students to Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester, the vocational program at Apponequet remains in several independent living classes.

With the building of the former George R. Austin Middle School in 1972, Apponequet became a senior-only high school, enrolling grades 9–12 in both the academic and vocational schools.

Major additions and renovations were completed in 1972 (8 classrooms), 1989 (9 classrooms, a new Library/Media Center, and a TV studio/choir room) and 2000 (two classrooms, an Art Room, a Lecture Hall/choir room, and extensive renovations throughout the building). The 2000 renovation was noted for the destruction of many murals throughout the building that had been designed by students in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

As of the 2018–2019 academic year, the administration consists of Principal Dr. Barbara Starkie, and Assistant Principals John Higgins and Kahlan Dessert.

==Academics==
Apponequet Regional High School currently has an enrollment of approximately 800 students in grades 9–12. The school&#x27;s 83% graduation rate is lower than the Massachusetts state average of 86%. Apponequet provides currently 16 Advanced Placement classes that are offered to all students.

Currently, ARHS offers two foreign languages: Spanish and French. Both AP Classes are offered for each language.

Apponequet also participates in the Virtual High School. A program consisting of courses not traditionally offered at ARHS.

=== Advanced Placement ===
Apponequet Regional High School offers Advanced Placement courses in English Literature and Composition, English Language and Composition, European History, United States History, Psychology, Calculus, Biology, Physics, Environmental Science, Chemistry, Spanish, French and Studio Art. Students may also access AP courses through VHS.

A total of 354 Advanced Placement exams were administered to 200 students in May, 2018. Overall, 55% of all students in grades 11 and 12 took at least one AP exam, and 76% of the exams administered received scores of “3” or above. Students scored above state averages in 10 subject areas.

=== National Honor Society ===
The honor roll is composed of students who have met high academic achievement standards. It is created when report cards are issued. There are three categories of academic honors: Highest Honors - no grade lower than an A High Honors - no grade lower than an A− Honors - no grade lower than a B.

Selection for Membership: A student who has achieved an academic average of 3.6 at the conclusion of his/her second or third year of study at ARHS is eligible for membership in the National Honor Society. The student will be notified in writing of his/her eligibility and will be invited to complete an application for admission. The application, reviewed by the National Honor Society Advisory Council, will provide the council with documentation of the student&#x27;s leadership skills, high moral character and participation in at least 10 hours of school and community service.

=== Virtual High School ===
Virtual High School is an on-line/distance learning opportunity. Through VHS, students enroll in unique courses not traditionally available at ARHS. Students may earn up to 2.5 credits per semester or up to 5 credits per year and may choose from a catalog of semester and yearlong courses, including Honors, College Preparatory, and Advanced Placement. VHS classes take place entirely over the Internet and mirror the format of college courses. The structure of VHS courses requires productivity, initiative, and self-direction from students who will be entirely accountable and responsible for their own learning. Students enrolled in VHS report to the Library or another assigned space to attend class. However, students can complete their work at any time during the week, as long as work is posted by specified due dates. A site coordinator is available for assistance and distribution of materials and progress reports. Students are chosen on a first come first served basis with preference given to seniors and juniors. Students may not enroll in any VHS course that is currently being taught at ARHS. VHS courses count toward a student&#x27;s GPA and class rank. VHS courses also count toward fulfillment of the graduation requirements.

=== Graduation Requirements ===
All students in the Class of 2019 are required to earn 110 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in MCAS testing in order to graduate. All students in the Class of 2020 are required to earn 115 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in MCAS testing in order to graduate. All students in the Classes of 2021 and 2022 are required to earn 120 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in the Next Generation MCAS testing in order to graduate. In order to earn a Competency Determination, all students must score above a 240 on English Language Arts and Math MCAS exams or successfully complete an Educational Proficiency Plan (EPP) if their scores range between 220 and 238. In addition, all students must pass a Science MCAS with a score of 220 or better. Students in the Class of 2021 will be subject to any scoring requirements associated with the Next Generation MCAS.

Apponequet&#x27;s mascot is the Lakers. The word &#x27;Apponequet&#x27; refers to the native tribe that resided within the local area surrounding the school. Previously, the image used as the Laker mascot consisted of a Red Indian chief and spear. These images were featured on the sports uniforms and clothing relating to the Lakers athletics. However, this was replaced in recent times due to controversy over Native American mascots. Currently the Lakers have adopted the University of Arizona &#x27;A&#x27; as their emblem on uniforms and clothing.

In the mid-to-late 1960s the school belonged to the South Shore League. It later removed itself to the Mayflower League for the 1970s and early 1980s, and finally joined the South Coast Conference upon its founding in 1986.

Both teams went on to claim the South Coast Conference Championship titles in both 2015 and 2016. The boys swim team has remained undefeated in conference dual swim meets for the past four consecutive years (2013–2016). The swim teams practice at the George R. Austin Intermediate School pool.

<doc id="713779" wikidata="Q612894" url="?curid=713779" title="Mount Hubbard">
<text>Mount Hubbard is one of the major mountains of the Saint Elias Range. It is located on the Alaska/Yukon border; the Canadian side is within Kluane National Park and Reserve, and the American side is part of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park. The mountain was named in 1890 by U.S. Geological Survey geologist Israel Russell after Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, which had co-sponsored Russell&#x27;s expedition.

Hubbard is the highest point of a large massif with three named summits; the other two are Mount Alverstone and Mount Kennedy. Alverstone and Hubbard form a corner of the Canada–United States border: the border extends roughly south from these peaks toward the Alaska panhandle, and roughly west toward Mount Saint Elias, approximately away. The Hubbard Glacier separates Mount Hubbard from Mount Vancouver to the west, while the Lowell Glacier lies to the east of the peak.

Mount Hubbard is the eighth-highest peak in the United States, and the twelfth-highest peak in Canada. It is also notable for its large rise above local terrain. For example, its west face rises above the Alverstone Glacier in less than , and the peak rises above the Hubbard Glacier to the southwest in only . Mount Hubbard is just over from tidewater at Disenchantment Bay. However, despite its precipitous drops to the west, the eastern side provides a non-technical (though long) route to the summit.

<text>Innisfail (from Irish: Inis Fáil) is a regional town and locality in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. The town was originally called Geraldton until 1910. In the , the town of Innisfail had a population of 7,173 people, while the locality of Innisfail (the town&#x27;s centre) had a population of 1,091 people.

Innisfail is the largest township of the Cassowary Coast Region and is known for its sugar and banana industries, as well as for being one of Australia&#x27;s wettest towns. In March 2006, Innisfail gained worldwide attention when Tropical Cyclone Larry passed over, causing extensive damage.

== Geography ==
Innisfail&#x27;s town centre is situated at the junction of the Johnstone River and South Johnstone River, approximately from the coast. It is located near large tracts of old-growth tropical rainforest surrounded by vast areas of extensive farmlands. Queensland&#x27;s highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere, part of Australia&#x27;s Great Dividing Range, is to the north.

The town&#x27;s central business district is in the vicinity of Edith Street and Rankin Street ().

===Climate===

Innisfail experiences a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af) and has no month with an average temperature below or with less than of rainfall. However, as a trade-wind climate that experiences frequent cyclones, it is not equatorial. Consistently, humid, very warm to hot weather dominates in Innisfail. In particular Innisfail is reputed as being among the wettest towns in Australia. Babinda, north of Innisfail is generally considered to be the wettest.

Unlike most of tropical Australia, the southern winter or &quot;dry&quot; season is not completely dry as moist easterly winds bring frequent showers; rainfall is, however, still far lower than during the southern summer. Monthly totals of over are common in the region between January and April and some months will not experience a day without rain if the monsoon is unusually heavy. The town gets around 63.5 clear days per year.

During the summer &quot;cyclone season&quot;, Innisfail is frequently under threat from tropical cyclones developing in the Coral Sea. High rainfall associated with these storms, combined with Innisfail&#x27;s riverside location often causes flooding.

Climate data is taken from Innisfail weather station, which has recorded rainfall since 1881 and temperature since 1908. Meanwhile, sun data was borrowed from the South Johnstone EXP weather station, 9.7 km SW of Innisfail.
== History ==

Prior to European settlement the Innisfail area was occupied by five separate societies of the Mamu people. These Aboriginal people followed migratory lifestyles in the rainforest and traversed rivers in string-bark canoes.

The first arrival of European people came in January 1872 when survivors of the shipwreck, the &quot;Maria&quot; arrived on the coastal areas surrounding what is now the Johnstone River. Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police came with the intention of rescuing remaining survivors and collectively punishing Aboriginals thought to have killed a number of the shipwrecked crew. In mid 1873, Johnstone returned to the area as part of another punitive mission and ventured further upriver between what is today Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point. Johnstone wrote very highly of the area, stating:
In October 1873, Johnstone again returned as part of the Northeast Coast Expedition led by the explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple. British settlement was first established at the junction of the north and south branches of the Johnstone River by this expedition on 5 October 1873. It was named Nind&#x27;s Camp after Philip Henry Nind who accompanied the party.

Later in 1879, Irishman Thomas Henry Fitzgerald arrived in the area to establish a sugar industry at his Innisfail Estate (now the locality of that name). He was accompanied by large numbers of Kanaka South Sea Islanders workers accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish labourers. The house built by Fitzgerald and thus the first establishment in the area was called Innisfallen, after the largest island in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland. Inis Fáil (Island of Destiny) is an ancient Irish name for Ireland itself. The name is used in the rarely sung third verse of &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;, the Irish national anthem. The stone mentioned may be the stone at Tara, Co Meath, at which high kings of Ireland were crowned.

From 1879, the settlement was named Geraldton (officially in July 1883) by Fitzgerald, but on 20 August 1910 it was renamed &quot;Innisfail&quot; to avoid confusion with the town of the same name in Western Australia. It was Margaret-Mary Noone a long time resident of the area who suggested the name Innisfail as a way to honour T.H Fitzgerald&#x27;s pioneering efforts and Ireland

Johnstone River Post Office opened on 1 November 1882 (a receiving office had been open from 1880), was renamed Geraldton two months later and Innisfail in 1910. 
The settlers who moved into this region from 1889 were exceptionally diverse. The first influential group were Anglo-Celtic, but they were outnumbered by &quot;Kanaka &quot; South Sea Islanders. Aboriginal and Torres Strait workers, Chinese miners who developed the banana industry and retail businesses. French merchants, and German timber and sugar producers.

In May 1885, the Queensland Government called for tenders to build the Geraldton Hospital to replace the existing tent hospital; however, the tenders submitted were more expensive than the government was willing to pay, so they called again for tenders in September 1885 resulting in a contract with E. Couchman for £1527.

Geraldton Provisional School opened on 18 July 1887 in the present-day Anzac Memorial Park on the corner of the Bruce Highway and Ernest Street () with an initial enrolment of 15 boys and 13 girls under head teacher Thomas Edward White. On 1 August 1894, it became Geraldton State School. On 21 January 1908, the school relocated to Emily Street. On 8 April 1913, the name was changed to Innisfail State School to reflect the renaming of the town. The original school site is commemorated with a plaque laid on 4 July 1987.

The Innisfail Parish within the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1898. It is now merged with the Mourilyian and South Johnstone parishes.

Sacred Heart Catholic School opened on 2 November 1902 with an enrolment of 42 students. It was operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. It was renamed Good Counsel Catholic Primary School in 1975. When the Sisters were no longer able to lead the school, it was briefly led by the Marist Brothers until the first lay principal was appointed in 1982. The Sisters withdrew from teaching in the school in 1990.

In 1906, Patrick Leahy established the &quot;Johnstone River Advocate&quot; newspaper, with the first issue published in December that year. Later it was renamed the &quot;Johnstone River Advocate and Innisfail News&quot;, the &quot;Evening Advocate&quot;, and the &quot;Innisfail Chronicle&quot;. The newspaper continues to be published as the &quot;Innisfail Advocate&quot;.

In June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year. The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established (in present-day Goondi Hill) with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound&#x27;s buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular.

The first Methodist church in Innisfail was completed about October 1913; a Methodist home missionary had been stationed from 1911. The church was at 61 Rankin Street (), opposite the Catholic church.
A huge cyclone swept through Innisfail on 10 March 1918, causing immense damage and killing many people. Buildings destroyed included the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church. So many buildings were severely damaged, that many new buildings were erected after the cyclone using concrete rather than the more traditional timber with tin roof. As Art Deco architecture was popular at that time, many of the new buildings were built in the Art Deco style. As a result, Innisfail is now considered one of the best Australian towns for Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the beginning of a major period of settlement by Italian immigrants and noteworthy populations from Greece and Malta. Later in this period populations from Yugoslavia, India and the Philippines would also settle in the area.

On Sunday 1 July 1928, Bishop John Heavey officially opened and blessed the new Catholic presbytery, built of reinforced concrete to protect it from cyclones, after the Catholic church and associated buildings were all destroyed in the cyclone of 1918. Heavey returned some week later to officially open and bless the new Mother of Good Counsel Catholic Church which cost £20,000 and was described as the largest Catholic church in Queensland outside of its capital Brisbane.
On 31 March 1931, a civic reception was held for an international Cricket Team which was followed by a tree planting ceremony where a number of palm trees were planted commemorate the visit to Innisfail by the team. Among the team was cricketer, Sir Donald Bradman. Donald Bradman was part of the international team, led by New South Wales Captain, Alan Kippax in 1931. These palms still stand in the town centre.

On Sunday 10 November 1935, a Greek Orthodox Church was opened and dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (also known as the Dormition of Our Lady) by Archbishop Timotheos, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop for Australia and Oceania, in the presence of 300 people. It was the second Greek Orthodox Church to be built in Queensland and the sixth to be built in Australia, but the first to be built outside of an Australian capital city. The brick church cost £1,000. The church began to deteriorate and local builder Mick Kremastos re-built the church in 1970.

Innisfail East State School opened on 3 February 1936.

Innisfail State High School opened on 24 January 1955 and operated until the end of 2009 at 2 Stitt Street (Mighell, ). In 2010, it was amalgamated with the Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre (a special education facility) and Tropical North Queensland TAFE (Innisfail Campus) to form Innisfail State College using the site of the TAFE campus at Innisfail Estate. Innisfail State High School&#x27;s website was archived.

On 3 July 1970, Innisfail State School introduced a special education program called Opportunity Classes. In 1980 these were replaced by the opening of Innisfail Special School on 29 January 1980. On 7 March 2003 the school was renamed Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre. In 2010 it was amalgamated into the Innisfail State College.

Radiant Life Christian College opened on 13 February 1982 and closed on 1 November 1991.

In 2001, Los Angeles band Sugar Ray filmed part of their music DVD &quot;Music in High Places&quot; at the Johnstone Crocodile Farm in Innisfail. 

The Innisfail War Memorial in Jack Fossey Park on Fitzgerald Esplanade was dedicated on 16 April 2005; it commemorates those who served in all wars.
Innisfail suffered extensive damage in 2006 due to tropical Cyclone Larry, an Australian Category 5 cyclone with over 100mm of rain in the span of three hours. It struck Innisfail at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town.

Severe structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. Clean drinking water was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the Australian Defence Force was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only one indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone. While Innisfail was always reputed to have a positive sense of community spirit, the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Larry and the unified cleanup effort acted to promote this spirit through shared suffering.

Cyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia. Inflated cost remained until farmers were able to meet demand again in early 2007. After the cyclone the township underwent something of an economic boom that stemmed from an influx of tradespeople and business eager to capitalise upon relatively significant insurance payouts. According to reports local trade had increased some 30 – 40% opposed to expected increases of 10%.

On 8 February 2007, the Johnstone Shire Council was sacked by the Queensland Government by the Local Government Minister, Andrew Fraser because of internal conflict, inappropriate behaviour and financial problems.

In 2011, in the early morning of 3 February, Cyclone Yasi crossed the far north Queensland coast causing damage to the Innisfail area. Although the damage was not as severe as Cyclone Larry, Cyclone Yasi still had a huge impact on Innisfail bringing strong winds of possibly 285 kilometres per hour.

Darlinga Forest School in February 2021 at 89 Mourilyan Road, East Innisfail. However, it was closed in mid-2023 by the Queensland Government&#x27;s Non-State Schools Accreditation Board.

<text>Juan Luis Rivera (born July 3, 1978) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers.

==Playing career==

===New York Yankees===
Rivera was signed by the New York Yankees as a non-draft amateur free agent in 1996 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 2001, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was hitless in four at-bats in three games that first season. He returned to the Yankees on June 5, 2002, and recorded his first hit, a double, against the Baltimore Orioles. He hit a .265 batting average with one home run in 2002, Nevertheless, it was enough to warrant Baseball America naming him the #1 prospect in the Yankees organization. His strengths were described as &#x27;above-average raw power&#x27;, &#x27;crushes fastballs&#x27; and had excellent defense. However, in spite of good contact, an impatient hitter and an average runner who would likely get slower with age.

Rivera was again recalled in 2003, this time to hit seven homers (including a multi-homer game) with 26 RBI and a .266 batting average.

===Montreal Expos===
He, along with Nick Johnson and Randy Choate, was traded to the Montreal Expos before the 2004 season for Javier Vázquez. In 134 games with Montreal in 2004, he finished with a .307 batting average, 12 homers and 49 RBI.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
On November 19, 2004, the Expos (on the verge of becoming the Washington Nationals) traded Rivera and shortstop Maicer Izturis to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for outfielder José Guillén. In his first season as an Angel, Rivera saw playing time as both an outfielder and a designated hitter. Although he started the season slowly, he stepped up his play in the final months of 2005 and finished with a .271 batting average and a then-career high 15 home runs and 59 RBIs in 106 games.

During the 2006 campaign, Rivera was made an everyday player, either starting at left field or serving as the designated hitter when veteran Garret Anderson played left. He finished the season with his best statistical year yet, batting .310 with 23 home runs and 85 RBI.

Juan Rivera was the starting left fielder for the Venezuelan team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic.

While playing for Oriente in Venezuela&#x27;s winter ball, Rivera broke his leg sliding for first and was placed on the disabled list by the Angels. This injury kept him out for most of the 2007 season, with the exception of a brief appearance for 14 games in September.

On December 19, 2008, Juan Rivera re-signed with the Angels for three years worth $12.75 million through 2011.

Rivera had a good hitting season, especially in the months of May to July. He hit 25 home runs, batted for an average of .287, and had an on-base plus slugging of .810. However, in contrast to the rest of the team, his baserunning was generally poor. Noted baseball analyst Bill James rated him the worst baserunner in the MLB in his annual book, because of his overaggressive tactics including being thrown out 8 times on attempts at going from first to third, costing his team an estimated 40 runs.

Rivera got 2010 off to a slow start, batting just .235 over the first two months of the season. He finished the season hitting .243 with 15 home runs.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
After the 2010 season, Rivera was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for outfielder Vernon Wells.

On July 3, Rivera was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays after hitting .243 with 6 home runs in 70 games for them during the first half of the 2011 season.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On July 12, 2011, Rivera was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On July 15, 2011, in his first at bat as a Dodger, he hit a home run on the first pitch he saw off Joe Saunders of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He went on to play in 62 games for the Dodgers, hitting .274 with 5 home runs and 46 RBI. After the season, he signed a new one-year contract with the Dodgers which included an option for 2013.

He spent most of the 2012 season platooning in left field (with Tony Gwynn Jr. and Bobby Abreu) and at first base (with James Loney). After the Dodgers acquired Shane Victorino and Adrián González in trades, Rivera was relegated to pinch hitting. In 109 games, he hit .244 with 9 home runs and 47 RBI. The Dodgers declined his 2013 option worth $4 million on October 29, instead electing to pay the $400,000 buyout, making him a free agent.

===New York Yankees===
On January 28, 2013, the New York Yankees signed Juan Rivera to a minor-league deal. On March 28, he was released by the Yankees.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On April 30, 2013, Rivera signed a minor league deal with the Diamondbacks, and played 2013 with the Reno Aces.

===2015 WBSC Premier12===

In November 2015, Rivera participated with the Venezuela national team in the inaugural WBSC Premier12.

==Batting style==
Rivera is distinguished by his high contact rate and low strikeout rate. In 2009, he had the ninth lowest strikeout percentage in the American League, at 10.8%. His career strikeout rate stands at 11.3% through the 2009 season, compared to an MLB average of 18.0%.

<doc id="713809" wikidata="Q6991116" url="?curid=713809" title="Nemesis (DC Comics)">
<text>Nemesis is the name of two fictional characters in the DC Comics universe. Thomas Andrew Tresser first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #166 (September 1980) and was created by Cary Burkett and Dan Spiegle. Soseh Mykros first appeared in &quot;JSA Annual&quot; #1 (October 2000) and was created by David S. Goyer and Uriel Caton.

==Creation==
Editor Paul Levitz instructed Burkett to created a new character for the Brave and the Bold anthology series as a back up Burkett recalled the process 

&quot;His instructions were for me to
create a character who was a &#x27;non- costumed&#x27; hero, one who would fit well into a Batman-themed book … with some general similarities, but strong differences&quot;

Burkett explained the genesis of the design of the character 

&quot;Paul had Dan Spiegle in
mind as the artist before the character was created, I think. I figured that costume-wise, Nemesis would operate in basic black, but Paul added the touch that he would have a patch of the Scales of Justice on his costume. It was the right touch, I think—the symbol was important to the character.&quot;

As for the story aspect Burkett spoke on the inspiration for the storyline of the character

&quot;The story I based his back-ground on was that of Edwin Booth, famous American actor in the 1860s and brother of the assassin John Wilkes Booth. After John Wilkes Booth killed President Abraham Lincoln, Edwin Booth&#x27;s reputation was destroyed as well for many years. He carried around the disgrace of the Booth name for years after the assassination. I crafted the origin of Nemesis around a similar situation.&quot;

==Publication history==
The Thomas Tresser character was created by writer Cary Burkett in 1979 and named for an actor with whom Burkett was rooming in New Hampshire. The character debuted in an eight-page backup story in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #166 (September 1980) written by Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle.

The character was featured in one of the &quot;Final Crisis Aftermath&quot; limited series &quot;Escape&quot;, written by Ivan Brandon with art by Marco Rudy. In 2010, he was the eponymous character in the mini-series &quot;Nemesis: The Impostors.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Thomas Andrew Tresser===

Thomas Andrew Tresser is a vigilante turned operative for the U.S. government and a master of disguise. His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a balance as a chest symbol and a chest holster.

He was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called &quot;the Council&quot;. Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Marshall and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents. Tom thus became &quot;Nemesis&quot;, preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name. With the assistance of the Batman, he cleared his brother&#x27;s name and saw the men responsible for his brother&#x27;s death dead.

This was covered in a backup series in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #166 through 192, with team-ups with the Batman in #170 and #193.

Nemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the council&#x27;s leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to Amanda Waller and Rick Flag. He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the Suicide Squad as a means of paying off what he perceived as a debt. Nemesis became an occasional member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and fell in love with one of their members, Nightshade.

During a mission in Moscow with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a failure, as she died in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flag and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and came into conflict with the Justice League because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis was allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad, but left the team after conflicts with Amanda Waller. He later returned only shortly to help retrieve Flag&#x27;s kidnapped son and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. This plot-point was never resolved.

Tresser was drafted into the Shadow Fighters to battle the villain Eclipso. He was originally the sole survivor of the Eclipso massacre that claimed the lives of the rest of the Shadow Fighters. He continued the fight against Eclipso in a smaller recon-team that also included Nightshade and the matter-manipulator Chunk. Nemesis and Chunk were saved from a nuclear bomb attack by Nightshade&#x27;s powers.
After his involvement with the Suicide Squad and the Shadow Fighters ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of &quot;Catwoman&quot;. In &quot;Superman Secret Files 2004,&quot; Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating Sarge Steel and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal. Furthermore, in the last issue of the second volume of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; the then-current team&#x27;s erstwhile leader Sgt. Rock is revealed to have been an impostor. Given the events of the &quot;Superman Secret Files&quot;, &quot;Rock&quot; may well have been Nemesis for some or all of his appearances with the Squad. The story of what happened to Nemesis between his &#x27;death&#x27; in &quot;Catwoman&quot; and subsequent reappearance in &quot;Superman Secret Files&quot; has not yet been told.

One Year Later after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Nemesis is seen aiding government agent Diana Prince, Wonder Woman in disguise, in the rescue of Donna Troy from several of the Amazon&#x27;s villains. Nemesis is part of the newly re-opened Department of Metahuman Affairs under Sarge Steel.

Around this time, Nemesis assists in saving the life of the second Maxi-Man. Shortly before the events of the &quot;Amazons Attack&quot; limited series, Nemesis questions the detainment of Wonder Woman by the D.M.A. and defies orders to rescue her. He uncovers a plot by the villain Circe to trick the U.S. government into destroying Themyscira under false pretenses. During the Amazon counterattack, he is stung by several gigantic Stygian Killer Hornets, native to the Amazon Nation. Wonder Woman risks her life by traveling to Themyscira for an antidote and revives Nemesis back into health.

Shortly thereafter, Nemesis is again wounded in battle. While he is recovering in the hospital, Wonder Woman begins courting Tresser, in the traditional Amazon manner. After formally meeting her mother Hippolyta, he is inducted as an Amazon despite being a male. He is given the title of Sir Thomas of Cleveland and given the ranking of Guardsman. Tom ends any potential relationship aside of friendship with Diana once he discovers that she does not truly love him but instead wanted to use him to create a family.

In the &quot;Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape&quot; storyline, Tresser is kidnapped and &quot;reprogrammed&quot; by the Global Peace Agency. He then appears in &quot;Nemesis: The Imposters&quot;, battling false versions of the DC Universe.

During the &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot; storyline, Nemesis checked into Sanctuary to deal with the stress of his vigilante work. It is unknown if Nemesis was killed in the unexpected attack or not.

===Soseh Mykros===
A second Nemesis debuted in &quot;JSA Annual&quot; #1 (October 2000), which had no connection with the original and was a completely different character.

Soseh Mykros was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of the council (not to be confused with the above-mentioned Council), a terrorist group that had once used the hero Paul Kirk, Manhunter. She originally operated as an ally of the Justice Society and assisted the team during a few adventures. She soon departed for other causes to her interest.

Eventually, she found herself teaming up with Black Adam&#x27;s group of loose cannon heroes, a group that—while altruistic—had no compunctions about killing or blurring the lines of legitimacy with their respective goals. She soon became romantically involved with her teammate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon Eclipso to himself, and for a time they were happy with one another. Of course, as with many such tragic romances, this was not meant to last for long. At some point in the series, Alex finally lost control of his body, allowing Eclipso to kill Soseh when her guard was down. Alex regained control, but it was too late. He committed suicide in remorse.
===DC Rebirth: Pennyworth clone===
During Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s time in the military, he was mentored by a man named Briar, who enrolled him in a program to become the Nemesis, a Batman-like figure. Frustrated with many failed pupils and Pennyworth&#x27;s unwillingness to kill, Briar would create a perfect young clone as the new Nemesis. Having reduced aging, he would survive to encounter Batman and Alfred in Miami. Eventually, Nemesis killed his master, and was allowed by Alfred and Batman to retreat into the wilderness.
==Relationship of Tresser and Mykros==
In DC Comics continuity, Mykros does not seem to have any connection to Tresser except for the fact that they both battled organizations named &quot;the Council&quot; and as a result Tresser was killed for Mykros to debut in &quot;JSA&quot;. When asked in an interview what happened to Nemesis (Tom Tresser), why he was killed in &quot;Catwoman&quot; #62, and was it true that his death was editorially mandated, &quot;Catwoman&quot; writer Devin Grayson explained:

==In other media==

The Thomas Tresser incarnation of Nemesis makes non-speaking appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as a member of the Justice League.

<doc id="713814" wikidata="Q688982" url="?curid=713814" title="The Brave and the Bold">
<text>The Brave and the Bold is a comic book series published by DC Comics as an ongoing series from 1955 to 1983. It was followed by a reprint miniseries in 1988, two original miniseries in 1991 and 1999, and was revived as an ongoing anthology title in 2007 and 2023. The focus of the series has varied over time, and it sometimes featured team-ups of characters from across the DC Universe, from 1965-1983 it was exclusively a Batman team-up book.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===
The first volume of the series ran for 200 issues from August/September 1955 to July 1983. Originally, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; was an anthology series featuring adventure tales from past ages with characters such as the Silent Knight, the Viking Prince, the Golden Gladiator, and Robin Hood. With issue #25, the series was reinvented as a try-out title for new characters and concepts, starting with the Suicide Squad created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru. Gardner Fox and Joe Kubert created a new version of Hawkman in issue #34 (February–March 1961) with the character receiving his own title three years later.

Editor Julius Schwartz hired Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky to create the Justice League of America. The team debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (February–March 1960), and after two further appearances in the title received its own series.

Issues #45 through #49 (Dec. 1962/Jan. 1963 through Aug./Sept. 1963) were devoted to &quot;Strange Sports Stories&quot;, combining sport and science-fiction in tales such as &quot;Challenge of the Headless Baseball Team&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Drove Through Time&quot;. Ten years later, in 1973, &quot;Strange Sports Stories&quot; was resurrected as a DC Comics title in its own right, but it lasted only six issues.

The series was changed yet again with issue #50 as a team-up title between established characters. Starting with issue #59 &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; became, more specifically, a Batman team-up book with the Caped Crusader as the book&#x27;s main focus. This was due to the popularity of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. After issue #74, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; was exclusively a Batman team-up title until it ended with issue #200.

The teaming of Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad in issue #54 (June - July 1964) by writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani led to the creation of the Teen Titans. The three heroes subsequently appeared under the name &quot;Teen Titans&quot; in issue #60 (June–July 1965) by Haney and artist Nick Cardy and were joined by Wonder Woman&#x27;s younger sister Wonder Girl in her first appearance.

The Metamorpho character was created by Haney and artist Ramona Fradon in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #57 (December 1964–January 1965).

The title was the first to feature Neal Adams&#x27; version of Batman, generating fan interest that led to Adams&#x27; style defining the modern Batman image to this day. In addition, Adams updated Green Arrow&#x27;s visual appearance by designing a new costume for the character in issue #85 (August–September 1969). The primary artist for the second half of the run was Jim Aparo, starting with #98 (October - November 1971). Haney frequently disregarded continuity by scripting stories which contradicted DC&#x27;s canon or by writing major heroes in an out-of-character fashion. Issue #100 (Feb.-March 1972) featured Batman and &quot;4 Famous Co-Stars&quot; (Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Robin) in a story by Haney and Aparo. Issues #112 (April - May 1974) to #117 (Feb.-March 1975) of the series were in the &quot;100 Page Super Spectacular&quot; format.

The character Nemesis, also known as Thomas Tresser, debuted in an eight-page backup story in issue #166 (September 1980) written by Cary Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle. The Tresser character was created by Burkett in 1979, and named for an actor with whom Burkett was rooming in New Hampshire.

Alan Brennert wrote four issues of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; featuring Batman teaming with the Creeper, Hawk and Dove, the Robin of Earth-Two, and the Catwoman. 
The title&#x27;s final issue featured a team-up of the Batmen of Earth-One and Earth-Two and included a preview of &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, the title that replaced &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; on DC&#x27;s schedule and became Aparo&#x27;s next regular assignment.

===Full list of issues===
===Volume 2===
In December 1991 - June 1992, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; returned as a six-issue miniseries featuring Green Arrow, the Question, and the Butcher. The miniseries was written by Mike Grell and Mike Baron.

=== &quot;Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold&quot;===
A six-issue miniseries was published from October 1999 - March 2000 starring the Flash and Green Lantern titled &quot;Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold&quot;. This miniseries was written by Mark Waid and Tom Peyer with art by Barry Kitson and Tom Grindberg. A trade paperback of this mini-series was published in 2001 ().

The title was used again in 2001 for &quot;The Brave and the Bold Annual&quot; #1 (1969), a one-shot special that reprinted selected Silver Age team-ups. The book was designed in the 1960s-style &quot;80-Page Giant&quot; format as if it were an actual annual issue of the original run of the title, which did not have an annual in 1969.

===Volume 3===
DC resurrected the &quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; title as another ongoing series in April 2007. Deciding that it would be a random team-up series, and not a Batman team-up series, the first writer was Mark Waid, who remained on the title for its first 16 issues. The first arc, &quot;The Lords of Luck&quot;, involved Batman in a team-up with Green Lantern Hal Jordan. The story depicted the characters joining forces with various other characters in tracking down the book of Destiny, with appearances by Supergirl, Lobo, Blue Beetle, the Legion of Super Heroes, Adam Strange, and the Challengers of the Unknown. The second arc picked up threads from the first, but mainly focused on self-contained stories.

After Waid&#x27;s departure, Marv Wolfman took over for a two-part storyline, involving Supergirl and Raven battling the son of Triumph, while David Hine and Doug Braithwaite did a four-issue arc on the series featuring Hal Jordan and the Phantom Stranger. Following this, Dan Jurgens wrote issue #23, featuring Booster Gold and Magog. Like Wolfman&#x27;s run, this era was prominent for its team-ups between DC heroes and the characters of Milestone Media. Writer Matt Wayne and artist Howard Porter collaborated on a team-up between Static and Black Lightning, and Adam Beechen and Roger Robinson wrote another featuring Hardware and Blue Beetle. The final Milestone issue was a team-up between Xombi and the Spectre, by John Rozum and Scott Hampton.

In September 2009, the title was taken over by J. Michael Straczynski and artist Jesus Saiz with issue #27, which featured a team-up between Batman and Dial H For Hero. Similar to the Milestone issues, it was intended for Straczynski&#x27;s run on the series to showcase the Red Circle Comics characters licensed from Archie Comics. This idea was ultimately scrapped. Following the first issue, Straczynski wrote team-ups between: Barry Allen and Blackhawk; the Joker and the Atom; Hal Jordan and Doctor Fate; Batman and Brother Power; Aquaman and Etrigan; and Barbara Gordon, Wonder Woman, and Zatanna, which served as a companion piece to Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;&quot; graphic novel.

=== &quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold Volume 1&quot; ===
DC published a 22 issue comic book adaptation of the animated series &quot;&quot; from 2009-2010. In 2010 it was followed by a 16 issue series titled &quot;All New Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot;&quot;.&quot;

=== Batman and Wonder Woman ===
In 2018, DC released a limited series starring Batman and Wonder Woman.

=== &quot;The Doomed and the Damned&quot; ===
In October 2020, DC released an 80-Page Giant called &quot;The Doomed and the Damned&quot;.

=== &quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold Volume 2&quot; ===
In May 2023, DC Comics released a fourth volume of the anthology series in entitled &quot;Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot;, as a part of the &quot;Dawn of DC&quot; initiative. The series includes stories centered around Batman and other Gotham City-based characters, in addition other DC Universe superheroes. The first issue is 64-pages and features four stories by creators including Tom King, Mitch Gerads, Guillem March, Gabriel Hardman, Dan Mora, and Rob Williams.

<text>Juan Manuel Rincón (born January 23, 1979) is a Venezuelan professional baseball coach and former relief pitcher. Rincón bats and throws right-handed. He throws a low 90s fastball and a mid to low 80s slider. In his career, Rincón posted a .208 BAA against left-handed hitters and a .248 BAA against right-handed hitters.

==Career==

===Minnesota Twins===
Rincón was originally signed by the Minnesota Twins as an amateur free agent in 1996. He worked his way up through the Twins farm system and was selected as a Midwest League All-Star in 1999 when he went 14–8 with a 2.92 ERA in 28 starts with the Single-A Quad Cities River Bandits.

Rincón made his major league debut with the Twins on June 7, 2001, against the Cleveland Indians, striking out two in a scoreless inning in relief. He spent eight seasons with the Twins, appearing in 386 games (three starts), ending with a 30–26 record and 3.69 ERA.

On May 2, 2005, Rincón became the fifth baseball player to be suspended for testing positive for illegal performance-enhancing drugs under Major League Baseball&#x27;s drug policy. He was suspended for ten days without pay as the policy dictates for a first offense.

On June 12, 2008, Rincón was designated for assignment after refusing an outright assignment to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. He was released on June 22.

===Cleveland Indians===
Rincón signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on June 24, 2008. He was 1–1 with a 5.60 ERA in 23 appearances for the Indians.

===Detroit Tigers===
On January 20, 2009, Rincón was signed by the Detroit Tigers to a minor league contract. He made the major league roster after spring training, but was designated for assignment on May 13, 2009, to make room on the active roster for Dontrelle Willis. Rincón had three days to accept an outright assignment to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens or become a free agent. On May 17, 2009, Rincon rejected an assignment to Toledo and elected free agency. Rincon posted a 5.23 ERA and was 1–0 in seven appearances with the Tigers.

===Colorado Rockies===
On May 25, 2009, Rincón signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in 26 games with the Rockies, going 3–2 with an ERA of 7.52.

Rincón was re-signed by the Rockies to a minor league deal on December 18, 2009. On May 1, 2010, he was designated for assignment to make room for spot starter Esmil Rogers. On May 3, he was assigned to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He became a free agent on October 15 after he refused an assignment to the minor leagues.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On February 11, 2011, Rincón signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was released at the conclusion of spring training and signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, where he went 2–1 with 23 saves and a 2.98 ERA in 42 relief appearances.

===Los Angeles Angels===
Rincón signed a split contract with the Los Angeles Angels on February 24, 2012, which did not include an invitation to spring training. Rincón hired Burton Rocks as his agent in 2013 to seek a job as player/coach with a big league organization.

== Coaching ==
On February 23, 2016, the Toronto Blue Jays hired Rincón to be their new pitching coach for the Gulf Coast Blue Jays, their rookie team, for the 2016 season.

<text>Survival is the eleventh studio album by Bob Marley and the Wailers, released in 1979.

&quot;Survival&quot; is an album with an outwardly militant theme. Some critics speculate that this was due in part to criticism Marley received for the laid-back atmosphere of his previous release, &quot;Kaya&quot;, which seemed to sidetrack the urgency of his message. In the song &quot;Africa Unite&quot;, Marley proclaims Pan-African solidarity. The song &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; is a hymn dedicated to then white-dominated Rhodesia. The song was performed at Zimbabwe&#x27;s Independence Celebration in 1980, just after the official declaration of Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence.

&quot;Survival&quot; was originally to be called &quot;Black Survival&quot; to underscore the urgency of African unity, but the name was shortened to prevent misinterpretations of the album&#x27;s theme. The album was partially censored in South Africa because of their apartheid regime.

==Front cover==
The album&#x27;s front cover depicts 48 African flags and one Oceanian flag. Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe Rhodesia at the time of the album&#x27;s release) is represented by two political flags instead of a national flag.

Four states already sovereign by the time of the album&#x27;s release didn&#x27;t have their flags featured in its cover art, though they were featured in a poster that came with the album:
* State of the Comoros
* Libya Jamahiriya
* Namibia

Two non-sovereign regions that didn&#x27;t have their flags included in the cover art are also featured on the poster:

* Réunion
*Western Sahara

Two nations&#x27; flags are grayed-out and are represented by numbers rather than names on the poster.
* Zimbabwe Rhodesia

The album&#x27;s title appears in white (City typeface) with the Brookes slave ship engraving in the background.

<doc id="713833" wikidata="Q477574" url="?curid=713833" title="Machias Seal Island">
<text>Machias Seal Island is an island in disputed water between the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy, about southeast from Cutler, Maine, and southwest of Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick. Sovereignty of the island is disputed by the United States and Canada. The Canadian Coast Guard continues to staff a lighthouse on the island; the first lighthouse was constructed there in 1832.

== Geography ==
The relationship of Machias Seal Island to the Grand Manan archipelago is unclear, but may be considered a continuation of the exposed shoals, rocks, and islets strewn south and west of the Grand Manan Islands, The deeper Grand Manan Channel is situated to the north and west of the island, separating it from the coast of Washington County, Maine.

The climate and weather of Machias Seal Island is typical for the region. It is fog-bound for many days of the year, similar to the weather found at the nearby coasts of Maine and Grand Manan. The weather often causes rough waters, making any approach to the island hazardous.

Machias Seal Island is named because it is an exposed and barren island, devoid of any trees, and is attractive for seals using it as a prominence. Its geography and remote location also makes it valuable as a sanctuary for seabirds such as Atlantic puffins, razorbills, common murres, common tern and Arctic terns, Leach&#x27;s storm-petrels, and common eiders.

It is a neighbor to North Rock, away.

== History ==

No surviving record shows the island was used by the Passamaquoddy Nation in the pre-European era, but presumably, it was a rest stop for any native tribes fishing or travelling nearby. There is also no record showing Machias Seal Island was actively settled during the years when the French and the British were exploring this part of North America, but presumably it was similarly used by those nations as a rest station when convenient. 

Britain established possession of Machias Seal Island and, under pressure from shipping interests at the burgeoning port of Saint John, New Brunswick, set up a lighthouse in 1832. There is no indication of either nation having a durable presence on the island prior to 1832. British-Canadian Lighthouse keepers, James Connolly and his sons, were the sole residents of the island for 37 years, before retiring to Saint Andrews.

On January 9 1869, a Sackville brigantine loaded with lumber and hay struck Gull Rock, an islet a quarter-mile from Machias Seal Island; the 9-man crew was saved by the Connollys and billeted at the lighthouse for four days before being taken back to the mainland. Six similar shipwrecks occurred during their tenure.

==Dispute==
The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict surrounding the American Revolutionary War. Article 2 of that treaty set the boundaries:
Both nations&#x27; ongoing disputes are seen in the American claim that disputed island are resolved by proximity to the American coastline, and the British claim that territories already considered part of Nova Scotia ought to be continued as part of New Brunswick today. The &quot;northwest angle&quot; of Nova Scotia refers to what is today New Brunswick, and the Canada–U.S. border still follows today the St. Croix River and a line due north from its source. At the time of the treaty&#x27;s writing, Grand Manan was considered to be farther North-Northeast from New England than it actually is. A line from the mouth of the St. Croix River to Brier Island and other parts of Nova Scotia across the Bay of Fundy would cross Grand Manan Island rather than contain the whole and its nearby islands.
Once the St. Croix River was unambiguously identified following a commission provided by Jay&#x27;s Treaty of 1794, it became clear that Machias Seal Island, as well as Grand Manan Island, was within 20 leagues () of the shores of the United States and south of the line drawn due east from the mouth of the St. Croix River, but it remained unclear whether the islands were within the defined limits of Nova Scotia and its 1621 founding. That charter specifies Islands within six leagues of the boundary are part of Nova Scotia. These limits are written in the original text of the land grant dated 1621 to Sir William Alexander (founder of Nova Scotia) in which all &quot;... islands, or seas lying near to, or within six leagues of any part ... of the said coasts&quot; are deemed part of Nova Scotia. Machias Seal Island as well as numerous islands in Maine are located within six leagues from the original boundary line, although Britain would later cease its claims on other islands in eastern Maine, notably, Moose Island.

The ambiguities resulted in both countries claiming several islands in Passamaquoddy Bay, including Grand Manan. During the War of 1812, the United Kingdom occupied coastal Maine extending from the border with New Brunswick (created from Nova Scotia in 1784) west to the Penobscot River valley. During this time, tolls were charged upon residents at various occupied harbors in the area. The UK withdrew their forces upon signing the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, with the stipulation being that the boundary should be better delineated in the area of the Grand Manan Channel. In 1817, the decision of a joint commission declared that Moose, Dudley, and Frederick Islands belong to the United States, while Grand Manan and all other islands of the Passamaquoddy Bay belong to Canada.

The Treaty of Ghent also failed to settle the dispute while stating in Article Four:

Machias Seal Island is not directly mentioned, although Grand Manan is finally settled to be part of British-Canada, as are the coastal islands of Maine to be part of the US. Machias Seal Island was again not considered. Later boundary treaties and negotiations extended the seaward boundary in the Grand Manan Channel in 1908–1910 to its present terminus, roughly equidistant between Grand Manan Island and the coast of Maine, and several nautical miles northeast of Machias Seal Island.

The island has also been claimed by the descendants of &quot;Tall Barney Beal&quot;, particularly Barna Norton, who ran boat tours to the island.

== Canadian interest ==
The United Kingdom, and later Canada, have maintained an ongoing interest in the island, largely through the continuous occupation of the lighthouse. Until the 1970s–1980s, lighthouse keepers from the Canadian Coast Guard would live on the island with their families, receiving supplies by sea from Grand Manan or Saint John. Since 1944, the island has been protected under its designation as the &quot;Machias Seal Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary&quot; (a wildlife and seabird sanctuary), managed by the Canadian Wildlife Service. No private citizen in Canada has made an ownership claim to Machias Seal Island, and Canada considers the property to be wholly owned by the federal government. The island has long been included in federal and provincial electoral districts, and policing has been enforced on the island by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and on waters surrounding the island by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. In the 20th century, some Canadian residents placed mining claims on the island as an exercise of sovereignty, despite the fact that it is considered a protected area.

== United States interest ==
In 1918, with Canadian agreement, a small detachment of U.S. Marines was placed on the island following the U.S. entry into the First World War, as a means to assist in protecting the territory and its key lighthouse guarding the entrance to the Bay of Fundy from German U-boat attack. These forces were withdrawn after several months, and no U.S. presence has been re-established since.

== Gulf of Maine boundary ==
Sovereignty of Machias Seal Island (and North Rock) would likely not still be in question today if it were not for the decision by Canada and the United States to avoid settling this issue in their 1979 joint application to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague in the Netherlands to have the maritime boundary delineated in the Gulf of Maine for fishing and mineral exploration purposes on Georges Bank.

Both nations avoided having ICJ rule on the sovereignty of Machias Seal Island and North Rock by agreeing to have a common starting point for the offshore boundary southwest of the island at , as reflected in the final ruling in the case. The gap in the agreed maritime boundary extends for several nautical miles from this point. Machias Seal Island and North Rock lie in an area of overlapping claims, known by local fishers as the &quot;grey zone&quot;.

== Conflict in grey zone ==
The &quot;grey zone&quot; is a gap between Canada and the United States that was designated in 1977. Without clear ownership of the area, both countries assert fishing efforts that have strained the lobster population and its respective economies. Rules and rights over the &quot;grey zone&quot; are governed by political and social factors, such as increased lobster fishing efforts and different management styles, which becomes a source of conflict when more than one entity seeks to control the space. These political and social factors accentuate resource competition and eventually lead to conflict. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) governs the Canadian lobster fisheries, but the United States&#x27; fisheries are governed both by the federal and the state governments. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission governs the federal zone of and off of Maine, and the state government controls the area within offshore.

Canada and the United States separately manage their fisheries&#x27; guidelines regarding the use of the &quot;grey zone.&quot; The international grey zone boundary led to a fishery dispute between Canadian and US lobster fishers that began in August 2002, when climate change began pushing lobster migration to the area. Within the disputed territory, Canadian and American trap fishers compete to fish for a valuable marine resource, lobster, and do not agree on management and conservation efforts. Fishers from both countries are impacted by drivers of change, including an economic imperative for growth, historical institutional failure in managing the ocean and coastal environment, and a changing social-ecological environment.

Those issues are exacerbated by political and social factors including a lack of clear rules for both sides, which leaves both sides to perceive that the other side is taking what is perceived to be theirs. Both sides express a perception of unfair treatment from the opposing government but are in fact similarly impacted by continuing poor governance and management over the region. Direct conflict arises between fishers from both countries as they feel that their well-being is threatened, and they attempt to take matters into their own hands. That has led to destruction of each other&#x27;s property and threats of harm. That tied hand in hand with the unfair treatment of fishermen who were trying to fish in the grey zone, an area that was deemed “undisputed land.” The reliance on lobster fishing from both the Canadian and American sides quickly became competitive for lobster.

Both Canadian and American fishers have expressed concern about conservation and their need for security of supply; however, the continued escalation of the conflict between them only fuels damage to stocks and puts future harvests at risk for fishers of both countries. Canadians favored closure of the summer season to all fishers so that the lobster population had the opportunity to spawn and reproduce; Americans favored maximum catch limitations. Canadian fisheries perceived a decrease in their catch due to American fishing efforts during the Canadian off-season and responded by allowing their fisheries to operate during the same time period. The conflict over the &quot;grey zone&quot; was exacerbated when both countries&#x27; catch declined as well as the lobster population. The overlying issue is conservation of the lobster population; however, the governing bodies from Canada and the United States have differing opinions regarding management. This lack of cooperation from both nations perpetuated conflict that led to stock depletion.

== Current status ==

Since the 1984 ICJ ruling on the Gulf of Maine decided the fate of offshore boundaries, Machias Seal Island and neighboring North Rock, an exposed rock outcropping about north-northeast at , as well as the surrounding waters, have become a political football for local politicians in fishing communities of coastal Charlotte County, New Brunswick and Washington County, Maine. There are few or no mineral or petroleum resources in the &quot;grey zone&quot; although there is a valuable lobster fishery, and fishermen from both countries exploit the lack of rules in the &quot;grey zone&quot; by overfishing various species.

In 1995, the Canadian Coast Guard dramatically reduced the number of staffed lighthouses on the Atlantic coast as a cost-saving measure. Today, all lighthouses in Eastern Canada except for the station on Machias Seal Island are unstaffed. The Machias Seal Island light had been automated several years prior to the announcement, but Global Affairs Canada is now covering the Canadian Coast Guard&#x27;s costs to maintain lightkeepers on Machias Seal Island &quot;for sovereignty purposes.&quot;

The DFO had issued an updated sustainability development strategy to involve a commitment to knowledge and technology for sustainable development between 2001 and 2003. The two goals were to better understand the nature and use of marine and fresh water resources and ecosystems to support decision making, and to effectively apply that knowledge and new technology to support safe and sustainable use of marine and freshwater resources.

Using the residence on the island, two lightkeepers are permanently staffed there. Flown by helicopter from the coast guard base in Saint John, they are rotated every four weeks. The Coast Guard employees also assist the Canadian Wildlife Service in maintaining the Migratory Bird Sanctuary and help any wildlife researchers who may stay on the island for a period of time.

<doc id="713838" wikidata="Q1989754" url="?curid=713838" title="Nighthawk (DC Comics)">
<text>Nighthawk is a fictional character, a cowboy in the DC Comics universe. His real name is Hannibal Hawkes and he first appeared in &quot;Western Comics&quot; #5. In his secret identity, he worked as a traveling repairman. He had a sidekick named Jim Peyton.

Created by Joe Millard and Charles Paris, his later adventures were handled by writers France Herron, Don Cameron, and Gardner Fox; and artists Gil Kane and Carmine Infantino.

==Fictional character biography==
He was shown as dying during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, although this has been retconned twice to fit in with the later revelation that he was a reincarnation of Prince Khufu — who would later be reincarnated as Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman. Current continuity has it that he was shot by a criminal named Matilda Roderic, who was presumably a reincarnation of the evil priest Hath-Set, who is apparently destined to kill Khufu in every life. Roderic&#x27;s descendant is the current Hath-Set.

The 2002 retcon also revealed he was the partner and lover of the Western heroine Cinnamon, who was the reincarnation of Khufu&#x27;s wife Chay-Ara.

Nighthawk appears in &quot;Guy Gardner&quot; #24 during the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; incident. He sported white sideburns at this point in time. His group of allies, which includes El Diablo and Bat Lash, were forming to take on the villain Extant and several men Extant had brainwashed. Nighthawk calls this group the &quot;Rough Bunch&quot; on more than one occasion. The time-lost heroes Steel, Supergirl, Guy Gardner and a version of Batgirl show up to help in the fight.

A modern-day version of the character appears in the Western-themed &quot;Robin&quot; (vol. 2) Annual #6, as a mercenary. He worked with Robin and the modern day Pow Wow Smith to track down the modern day Trigger Twins. They have a literal Main Street showdown in a Western-themed tourist attraction located near Gotham City.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
Nighthawk appears in &quot;The New 52&quot; issue &quot;All Star Western&quot;. Nighthawk&#x27;s new origin is that he left home as a child and worked on a whaling boat. The captain, a former slave, became a second father to him and Nighthawk was there when the man died. This death inspired Nighthawk to fight for justice and for the oppressed. Nighthawk is teamed with Cinnamon once again. Nighthawk uses a special medallion he found at an Indian burial site which gives him enhanced strength and healing abilities.

==In other media==
Nighthawk&#x27;s alien abduction from &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #3 is adapted into the song &quot;Westerner&quot; by French-Canadian electro-rock band Judge Rock.

<text>Juan Pablo Ángel Arango (born 24 October 1975) is a Colombian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

He began his career at Nacional, whom he helped to win the championship in 1994, and then moved to River Plate of Argentina, where he was the league&#x27;s top scorer in 2000. The following year he moved to Europe, joining Aston Villa of the Premier League for a club record £9.5 million. In 2007, he moved to the United States, where he played for three clubs in Major League Soccer before returning to Atlético Nacional in 2013, where he ended his career a year later.

Ángel was also a full international for Colombia, and made 33 appearances from his debut in 1995, scoring 9 goals.

Ángel is the father of footballer Tomás Ángel, who currently plays as a forward for San Diego FC.

==Career==

===Atlético Nacional and River Plate===
Ángel started playing professional football at Atlético Nacional in his home city of Medellín. Ángel began to make a name for himself when he scored the winning goal against local rival Independiente Medellín to help Nacional capture the 1994 Colombian title. During his time with his hometown club Ángel would appear in 147 league matches scoring 45 goals.

Ángel was sold to River Plate in Argentina in January 1998 as a replacement of the departed Hernán Crespo. River Plate spectators would often adorn angel wings to show their appreciation. During his time with the club, Ángel managed 62 goals in 132 games, including 16 goals in 25 Copa Libertadores matches.

===Aston Villa===
Ángel signed for Premier League side Aston Villa on 12 January 2001, becoming the club&#x27;s record signing at £9.5 million. Angel made his debut away to Manchester United in a 2–0 loss on 20 January 2001. In his time at Villa, he was reportedly Villa&#x27;s highest earner. After an indifferent start to his Aston Villa career, and family difficulties, Ángel settled down and started to reproduce the form that had persuaded chairman Doug Ellis to spend the large transfer fee. He quickly became a fans favourite and is the 3rd most recent Villa player to have scored more than 20 goals in one season (behind Christian Benteke in the 2012–13 season and Tammy Abraham in the 2018–19 season), finishing as the club&#x27;s top scorer in the 2003–04 season with 16 goals in the FA Premier League, (23 goals including cup competitions) but could not maintain that form as Villa struggled and he only managed seven goals in 2004–05. That season he also missed two penalties in one game against Fulham. During his time with the club, Ángel managed 62 goals in 205 games across all competitions. Only two players have scored more goals for Villa in the Premier League era, those being Dwight Yorke (97 goals in 288 games) and Gabriel Agbonlahor (74 goals in 284 games).

===New York Red Bulls===
On 17 April 2007, the New York Red Bulls announced the signing of Ángel as their second designated player, pending the approval of his work visa. After his visa was approved, Ángel made his Red Bull debut 8 May 2007 in a US Open Cup qualifying match. Ángel came on as a substitute and scored from a free kick in extra time during the Red Bulls&#x27; 3–1 loss to Los Angeles Galaxy. 
Ángel also recorded an assist and played an important role in a third goal to round off a performance that earned him that week&#x27;s MLS Player of the Week award. His form showed no signs of letting up in the following game, as he weighed in with two goals and another assist as the Red Bulls overcame Chicago Fire to win 3–0, taking them to joint top of the Eastern Conference.

Ángel was voted MLS Player of the Month for May 2007. He became the first Red Bull player to score in six straight games.

On 18 August 2007, Ángel added two more goals to his tally. His team defeated Los Angeles Galaxy 5–4. Ángel scored the first goal early on from a free kick before striking a late winner to seal the game for the Red Bulls. Ángel also scored the first goal of the 2007 MLS All-Star Game on 19 July 2007 against Celtic, and later was named MVP of the Match for his performance. On 29 September 2007, Ángel scored a penalty to tie the Red Bulls&#x27; game against Real Salt Lake and in doing so scored his 17th goal of the season in all competitions, setting a new franchise record. Ángel concluded his initial campaign in New York scoring 19 goals and 5 assists in 24 league matches (20 goals in 27 matches in all official competitions). His regular season goal total was one short of Luciano Emilio who led the league with 20 but who had also played more games.

Ángel had a slow start to the 2008 season due to an arthritic nerve-related injury in his lower back that caused him to have pain in his hamstring but he finally scored his first of the season in his fourth appearance – a 2–1 winner against LA Galaxy on 10 May. On 5 June he fought through a still painful injury to score the only goal in New York&#x27;s home win against Chivas USA. However, in doing so he also picked up another slight hamstring strain and after the final whistle he was seen limping off the pitch. As a result of this injury Ángel missed the Red Bulls&#x27; next 4 league games. Even through this injury-plagued season, his three goals were enough for coach Steve Nicol to name him to the 2008 MLS All-Star Game vs West Ham United in which he fed the pass that earned the game winning penalty kick and also scored a goal that was disallowed due to a controversial offside. Ángel concluded his second season in New York scoring 14 goals in 23 league matches (16 goals in 28 matches in official competitions).

Ángel&#x27;s third season in New York was a major disappointment as the club had one of the worst seasons in club history. The club was quickly eliminated from play-off contention and failed to qualify to the group stages of the CONCACAF Champions League. However, Ángel still had his moments during the campaign as he became the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer. On 26 September 2009, he scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw at Chivas USA, that goal being the 46th of his career with New York and breaking Clint Mathis former record of 45. Ángel ended his season leading the club in scoring for the third straight year scoring 12 goals in 25 league matches.

Juan Pablo Ángel&#x27;s 2010 season was greatly improved. He started off slow but slowly progressed during the first half of the season to claim a total of 11 goals from 19 games. He slumped in the second half of the season but concluded the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 13 goals in 30 regular season appearances. On 2 June 2010, Angel scored the game-winning goal in a match against the Houston Dynamo, snapping a four-game losing streak. On 21 October 2010, Ángel assisted Dane Richards on the opening goal in a 2–0 victory over New England Revolution which helped New York clinch its second ever regular season Eastern Conference title.

On 11 November 2010, it was announced that he would not be returning to the Red Bulls for the 2011 Major League Soccer season. Ángel trails only Bradley Wright-Phillips in the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal record, with 62.

====Play-offs====
On 26 October 2007, Ángel told the New York Daily News, &quot;It&#x27;s very American, in every sport the playoff system ... I think there should be more credit to the guys who do well in the regular season. It&#x27;s interesting. It&#x27;s a little bit unfair. I&#x27;m trying to understand it. I might answer you in a different way in a couple of weeks.&quot; A week later, Ángel and the Red Bulls were knocked out of contention for the 2007 MLS Cup by the New England Revolution on a 1–0 aggregate score as Ángel pleaded to his manager to be brought back on after coming off for treatment to a head injury received during the match which turned out to be a concussion.

The following season Ángel would help lead the Red Bulls to their first ever MLS Cup final. On the way they defeated Houston Dynamo 3–0 (4–1 aggregate) and Real Salt Lake 1–0, but ultimately lost the final to Columbus Crew 3–1. After a poor 2009 season the Red Bulls failed to qualify for the post season for the first time since Ángel&#x27;s arrival.

The New York Red Bulls qualified the next season for the playoffs, with Ángel doing extremely well during the regular season. They ended up losing in the first round of the playoffs, losing 3–2 on aggregate, where Ángel scored a late goal to make the intense game 2–1 (2–2 aggregate) but Chris Wondolowski scored an even later goal to win it.

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
After the 2010 MLS season New York declined Ángel&#x27;s contract option and Ángel elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On 15 December 2010 Ángel was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft. On 19 January 2011, the club announced that they had signed Ángel to a multi-year contract which would make him the Galaxy&#x27;s third designated player. He scored his first goal of his 2011 Galaxy campaign in a 4–1 loss against Real Salt Lake.

===Chivas USA===
On 17 August 2011, Ángel was traded to Chivas USA to make room for new Los Angeles designated player Robbie Keane. Ángel scored his first goal for &#x27;the Goats&#x27; in his debut against the Colorado Rapids. Returning to form, he would go on to finish the 2011 season with seven goals in nine games.

Ángel remained with Chivas USA through the 2012 season. His contract expired after 2012 and he made himself eligible for the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft in December 2012. Ángel became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds.

===Atlético Nacional===
Ángel&#x27;s career came full circle in January 2013 when he signed a one-year contract to play for and captain his first club, Atlético Nacional. He arrived as a reinforcement to try and solve the club&#x27;s goalscoring troubles under coach Juan Carlos Osorio, who was also responsible for bringing Ángel to New York. As a sign of commitment to the team, his wage in Medellín was only 30 million pesos (US$15,600) per month compared to his former salary in the US which was 300 million pesos (US$156,000) a month.

On 2 February 2013, Ángel wore green again as a starter at the Estadio Atanasio Girardot where he scored a goal from the penalty spot in his team&#x27;s 3–0 victory against Atlético Huila. His second debut for the club would prove an ominous sign as the striker&#x27;s return led to a dominant spell for Nacional. Ángel finished as his team&#x27;s top goalscorer in the 2013 Apertura campaign as he helped fire them to the league title – the first of three consecutive championships (later adding the 2013 Clausura and 2014 Apertura), becoming the first club to achieve this since the Colombian league switched to the Apertura/Clausura format in 2002.

In addition to helping &#x27;Los Verdolagas&#x27; return to league success, Ángel also lifted the 2013 Copa Colombia and helped his side reach the final of the Copa Sudamericana in 2014. He would play in the second leg of Nacional&#x27;s losing effort in the Sudamericana final against former club River Plate on 10 December 2014. Of the game, he said: “I am closing my career in a final with the two clubs I love the most. I am overjoyed because that will be the last image that stays with me from football. I have lots of conflicting feelings; it is a wonderful way to end my career, as good as it gets.”
 Three days later, he made the final appearance of his career, coming on in the 72nd minute of a 1–0 loss to Santa Fe.

<doc id="713843" wikidata="Q7374738" url="?curid=713843" title="Royal Prince Alfred Hospital">
<text>The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (abbreviated RPAH or RPA) is a large teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, located on Missenden Road in Camperdown. It is a teaching hospital of the Central Clinical School of the Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney and is situated in proximity to the Blackburn Building of the university&#x27;s main campus. RPAH is the largest hospital in the Sydney Local Health District, with approximately 1200 beds. Following a $350 million redevelopment, the perinatal hospital King George V Memorial Hospital has been incorporated into it.

An Australian television documentary, &quot;RPA&quot;, was filmed there from 1995 to 2012, depicting the everyday workings of a major metropolitan hospital.

==History==

Royal Prince Alfred is one of the oldest hospitals in NSW. The funds were raised by public subscription, to make a monument to commemorate the recovery of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh from an assassination attempt in 1868 by Henry James O&#x27;Farrell. Thomas Holt was founder and director of the hospital from 1873 to 1883. This new hospital was originally proposed to be built in Macquarie Street, to incorporate the Sydney Infirmary. However, the Board of that institution rejected this proposal.

On 3 April 1873 Parliament passed an Act to incorporate Prince Alfred Hospital. Mansfield Brothers were appointed as architects to design the buildings. The first building erected was a cottage, near the southern entrance from Missenden Road, which later became the gardener&#x27;s cottage. Construction started on the Administration Building and C and D Pavilions in 1876, at which time gardens were also established, with assistance from the staff of the Botanical Gardens. The Administration Building is Victorian Free Classical in style, built symmetrically about a three-storied portico. It boasts a cream brick façade and sandstone embellishments, with red bricks emphasising the ground floor arched openings. The entrance portico has grey granite columns. Since 2015, the roof covering has been restored to the original slate with ornate ventilators. All weathered areas of stone cornicing and enrichments were also replaced. The hospital was opened in 1882.

Both the Victoria and the Albert Pavilion are three-storied Federation Free Classical style red brick buildings. The original pavilions were constructed to commemorate the royal visit of Prince Alfred. The foundation stone was laid in 1901 and the buildings were completed in 1904. Both pavilions have handsome elevations, dominated by a projecting bay surmounted by a pediment bearing copper clad statues of Queen Victoria (southern pavilion) and Prince Albert (northern pavilion). The Queen Victoria Pavilion was extended in relatively sympathetic manner by the construction of the Fairfax Institute of Pathology in 1943. The buildings were designed by Walter Liberty Vernon.

The Admission Block and the Victoria &amp; Albert Pavilions are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.

===Teaching===
It was only two years after its opening in 1882 that the hospital accepted its first medical students from the Medical School of the University of Sydney. Since then, the hospital has benefited from this close relationship at the teaching, research and clinical levels. For example, it is the only public hospital in Australia to offer a comprehensive revision course for the RACP written exam for basic physician trainees.

==Clinical services==

RPA&#x27;s staff of over 4,000 provides the largest number of in-patient treatments in the state, almost 500,000 out-patient treatments, 45,000 adult and paediatric emergency department patients and delivers 4,000 babies each year. With around 50 percent of all admissions being district services, RPA treats more public patients than any other hospital in the state.

Within RPA itself, four clinical sections provide specialty clinical services: Division of Medicine, Division of Surgery, Division of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology and Division of Diagnostic Service. In addition, a range of Allied Health services are also provided, including clinical psychology, psychiatry, health promotion, nutrition and dietetics, orthotics, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, clinical pharmacy, podiatry, speech pathology, social work and volunteer service.

===New facilities===

RPA has undertaken an extensive program of refurbishment and construction. 
Public spaces including gardens for patients have been renovated; views of the city, hospital gardens and the University of Sydney. New facilities include the Hot floor, a purpose-built nucleus of critical care services. It brings together operating theatres; intensive care; high dependency units; cardiac intensive care; neuro intensive care; day-stay centre and neonatal intensive care.

Sydney Cancer Centre – The only ambulatory care centre of its type in Australia, combining diagnostic, consultative and follow-up services.

Obstetric and gynaecological services – A birthing unit with nine delivery rooms, three home-like birthing rooms and 32 neonatal cots.

Diagnostic services – Facilities include positron emission tomography; X-ray/digital scanner rooms; computerised axial tomography scanners; ultrasound room; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and angiography rooms.

Institute of Rheumatology and Orthopaedics – 60 bed unit covering diagnosis; orthopaedic theatre suite; medical treatment unit; outpatient clinics; rehabilitation; allied health services; hydrotherapy pool and a TGA licensed bone bank.

Day-surgery centre – 38 bed centre containing separate admissions station, operating theatres and recovery area.

NSW Health Pathology – Laboratory services in diagnostic pathology including the NSW porphyrin reference unit. Previously known as the Sydney South West Pathology Service – Eastern Zone and Central Sydney Laboratory Service.

Charles Perkins Centre, dedicated to specialised healthcare and associated clinical research into obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related areas. Facilities include a whole-body calorimeter, metabolic kitchen, exercise physiology gymnasiums, physical testing facilities, phlebotomy bays, biobank, long-term stay beds, wet and dry research labs and more.

==Research==
RPA is home to more research institutes and specialist units than any other public hospital in Australia, including:
*Melanoma Unit – the largest in the world
*National Liver Transplant Unit
*Haemophilia Centre – Australia&#x27;s first major centre in this area
*Sleep Disorders Unit – an Australian first, the unit developed the revolutionary CPAP machine for sleep apnoea sufferers, and pioneered non-invasive ventilation treatment for respiratory failure.
*Sydney Cancer Centre – Australia&#x27;s largest and most comprehensive cancer treatment centre
*Positron Emission Tomography Camera
*Charles Perkins Centre
*Heart Research Institute
*National Medical Cyclotron
*National Poisons Register
*Sydney Breast Cancer Institute – pioneered breast-sparing surgery in NSW
*Woolcock Institute of Medical Research – Australia&#x27;s only centre devoted to respiratory and sleep diseases and the leading partner in the national Cooperative Research Centre for asthma.
*RPA Diabetes Centre – a pioneering unit which has developed into the most comprehensive centre for the multidisciplinary clinical care and research for diabetes in Australia. This was recognised by way of the Kellion Award in 2010.
*Rachel Forster Bone Bank – In 1984 RPA orthopaedic surgeons Harry Tyer and Paul Stalley pioneered Australia&#x27;s first Bone Bank using living donors undergoing elective orthopaedic procedures.

The hospital also sponsors a number of institutes at the University of Sydney, including the Charles Perkins Centre, Heart Research Institute; Centenary Institute for Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology; Kanematsu Memorial Institute of Pathology; and General Endocrinology Group.

==Royal Prince Alfred Hospital School==

The Department of Education operates a school within the hospital, known as Royal Prince Alfred Hospital School. Executive, teaching and administrative staffing and funding is provided by the DET in liaison with the hospital&#x27;s paediatric and nursing units, and may vary according to the changing needs of the school. The school is operated as part of the Botany Bay Network of schools within the Sydney Region.

== Notable staff ==

* Susan B. McGahey (1862–1919), Matron 1891-1904. She had trained at The London Hospital, Whitechapel, in London, under Eva Luckes between 1884 and 1886. McGahey introduced Nightingale style nursing, organised nurse education and founded the Prince Alfred Hospital Trained Nurses Reunion (alumni association). The then Chairman of the Board of Directors, Professor Anderson Stuart refused to allow her to establish a nurse training school, and she resigned in 1904. She was a Foundation Member of the International Council of Nurses, and was President in 1904. She was also one of the founders of the Australasian Trained Nurses Association.
*Frank Mills (1910–2008), cardiac surgeon

<text>Regina International Airport is an international airport located in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, located south-west and west-southwest of the city centre. It is run by the Regina Airport Authority. In 2022, it was the 16th busiest airport in Canada.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 120 passengers. However, they can handle up to 250 passengers if the aircraft is unloaded in stages.

==History==


===Early aviation (1911–28)===
The first site in Regina used for flying was the infield at Regina Exhibition Park&#x27;s horse race track, where visiting barnstormer &quot;Lucky Bob&quot; St. Pierre (a Nebraskan whose real name was &quot;Shaeffer&quot; or &quot;Shaffer&quot;) flew a Curtiss Model D biplane in August, 1911. A few other barnstormers, notably aviator Katherine Stinson of the famous aviation family, appeared in Regina and other prairie cities in the years thereafter, but there was virtually no other aviation activity in Western Canada during the First World War.

After the First World War, Reginan Roland Groome returned from military service as a flying instructor in Southern Ontario and, with partners, set up a company called the &quot;Aerial Service Co.&quot; Its primitive airfield was located near what is the current intersection of Hill Avenue and Cameron Street in the city&#x27;s southern Lakeview district. In May 1920, federal government regulators assigned this field the designation of Canada&#x27;s first licensed &quot;air harbour&quot;. Groome also received Canadian commercial pilot&#x27;s licence No. 1 and mechanic Robert McCombie was given air engineer&#x27;s licence No. 1.

===Current site (1928–39)===
The airport site was developed from 1928 to 1930. A terminal building was built in 1940. Scheduled airline service was initially provided by Moose Jaw-based Prairie Airways (in 1938) and then Trans-Canada Air Lines (in 1939).

===World War II (1939–45)===
In the beginning of the war, the Regina Flying Club was heavily involved in the contract training for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The majority of this training was conducted out of the Regina Municipal Airport. The implementation of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan in the early 1940s resulted in the formation of No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) and RCAF Station Regina at the Airport on November 11, 1940. The School was managed by the Regina Flying Club and was in operation at the site until it was closed on August 11, 1944. From November 1–30, 1945 the former 15 EFTS facilities at the airport were used as a release centre for Airmen leaving the service.

====Aerodrome====
Around 1942, the airport was listed as RCAF &amp; D of T Aerodrome - Regina, Saskatchewan at with a variation of 17 degrees east and elevation of . Three runways were listed as follows:

===Relief landing field – Brora===
The primary relief landing field (R1) for RCAF Station Regina during the war was located north of the city of Regina, at .

===Post-World War II (1945–90)===
A new terminal building was erected in 1960. Major renovations to this terminal building were conducted in 1983–86.

===Recent history (1990–present)===
A $24-million expansion started in January 2004, increasing its capacity to 1.2 million passengers per year. The first stage of the expansion included the expansion of the terminal and includes a larger post-security holding room, another passenger loading bridge, an expansion to the international arrivals area and more baggage carousels. The first phase was completed in August 2005.

The second phase is now under way and includes further expansion for security services and for facilities for new tenants such as stores and eating establishments (including a Tim Hortons). In 2009, construction began on two new jetways, one between gates 5 and 6, to the right of the glass atrium, and the other as an offshoot of gate 1. This is to keep up with airport demand and to further increase passenger comfort and safety in winter months.

===Scheduled service===
On May 1, 1995, under the Canada-US Open Skies agreement, Northwest Airlines began service to Minneapolis–Saint Paul. United Express then began non-stop service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare and Denver. In 1996 WestJet began Boeing 737-200 service. Air Canada, which began scheduled service to Regina in early 1939, ended mainline service into Regina and six other medium-sized Canadian cities in October 2005, turning over these routes to its subsidiary Air Canada Jazz and its fleet of Canadair Regional Jets (CRJ). Mainline service to Toronto returned on November 2, 2008, using the Embraer E-190 aircraft. In the summer of 2010, Air Canada Jazz introduced summer seasonal service between Regina and Ottawa using the CRJ-705 aircraft, as well late in 2013 WestJet Encore started service to Calgary using the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft. Since then, Edmonton and Winnipeg have been added to WestJet&#x27;s Encore network out of Regina. Starting in the 2014 summer season, WestJet has also added two weekly flights to Las Vegas, one flight on Wednesday, and the other being on Saturday.

In late 2014, United Airlines cancelled service to Chicago, and on February 28, 2015, cancelled service to Denver. In May 2016, Delta Air Lines confirmed that service to Minneapolis would cease on July 31, 2016, ending the last year-round service from Regina to the United States.

For a short period of time in 2016, ultra low-cost carrier NewLeaf (now Flair Airlines) operated flights to and from Kelowna before suspending the service on November 1, 2016. There were then plans to continue the service.

As of 2019, the CEO of Regina Airport was in talks with multiple airlines for possible services back to the United States with a 1.55% increase in passengers in 2018. 

Air Canada indefinitely suspended its routes from Regina to Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Saskatoon in June 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

Sunwing Airlines also indefinitely suspended routes from Regina to Sun destinations for the 2020/2021 winter season due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. No news has been announced for their return.

Service returned on August 24, 2020, to Toronto and Vancouver with Flair Airlines.

On November 15, 2021, Swoop announced that it would launch a twice-weekly service between Regina and Edmonton starting June 16, 2022.

Since the spring of 2022, Flair Air has suspended its service to Regina and has so far not announced any date for a return. Subsequently, Swoop flew their last flights to Toronto in October 2022, and would not be returning to Saskatchewan as a whole in the summer 2023 season.

Year-round service to the United States resumed on April 28, 2024 with flights to Minneapolis-St Paul.

==Passenger services==
Passenger services at YQR are under significant renovation. In late 2013 and early 2014, Regina Airport Authority (RAA) undertook efforts to develop and execute a strategy to improve retail, food and beverage services at Regina International Airport. Services currently include a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop, Tim Hortons Express, Relay (Duty Free) and a fully renovated Rumor Handcrafts shop. In addition, post-security, there is the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge, a children&#x27;s play area, vending machines, free Wi-Fi and a historical display located post-security. There is also a four-currency ATM just prior to security that dispenses US and Canadian dollars, euros, and British pounds.

Presently, the restaurant located on the second floor pre-security is currently closed for renovations. Post-security services for food and beverage are also under construction, a reduced menu is available in the Lounge (post security). From April 1 until October 1, 2015, YQR was working on additional and expanded food service options before and after security, expanded post-security retail services and improved lay-out in the main restaurant to improve traffic flow.

Current Air Terminal Building Food, Beverage &amp; Retail:

* 1st Floor - Pre-security: Brioche Dorée
* 2nd Floor - Post-security: Tim Hortons (Full Menu), Skyway Grill, 360 Bistro + Bar, Relay, Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge

==Facilities==

The RAA Fire Department (with crew of 10) operates from a single fire station housing two Rosenbauer Panther 6x6 ARFF as well as a Rosenbauer AirWolf Rapid Intervention Vehicle in 2012.

In 2012 RAA completed renovations to the existing airport fire hall.

Ground transportation options to/from the airport include taxi, private vehicles, and Regina Transit&#x27;s &quot;Route 24 Airport/Downtown&quot;, which opened in 2023.

<doc id="713863" wikidata="Q359560" url="?curid=713863" title="Walt Rostow">
<text>Walt Whitman Rostow (; October 7, 1916 – February 13, 2003) was an American economist, professor and political theorist who served as national security advisor to president of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson from 1966 to 1969.

Rostow worked in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and later was a foreign policy adviser and speechwriter for presidential candidate and then President John F. Kennedy; he is often credited with writing Kennedy&#x27;s famous &quot;New Frontier&quot; speech. Prominent for his role in shaping US foreign policy in Southeast Asia during the 1960s, he was a staunch anti-communist, noted for a belief in the efficacy of capitalism and free enterprise, and strongly supported US involvement in the Vietnam War. Rostow is known for his book &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto&quot; (1960), which was used in several fields of social science. Rostow&#x27;s theories were embraced by many officials in both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as a possible counter to the increasing popularity of communism in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

His elder brother Eugene Rostow also held a number of high government foreign policy posts.

==Early life==
Rostow was born in Manhattan, New York City, to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. His parents, Lillian (Helman) and Victor Rostow, were active socialists, and named Walt after the poet Walt Whitman. Rostow&#x27;s father, Victor Rostowsky, was born in the town of Orekhov near Odessa in 1886, and was involved in the Russian socialist movement as a teenager, publishing a left-wing newspaper in the basement of his parents&#x27; house calling for the overthrow of the Emperor Nicholas II. In 1904, at the age of 18, Victor Rostowsky boarded a ship that took him from Odessa to Glasgow and another ship that took him to New York. Upon arriving in the United States, Rostowsky &quot;Americanized&quot; his surname to Rostow. On 22 October 1912, he married Lillian Helman, the intellectually gifted daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants who longed go to college, but as her family was too poor to afford higher education, she instead encouraged her sons to attain the higher education she wanted for herself. Like the Rostowskys, the Helmans were &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; (Yiddish-speaking Jews). The Rostows were described as being very &quot;idealistic&quot; immigrants who deeply loved their adopted country and named their three sons after the three men they considered to be the greatest Americans, namely Eugene V. Debs, Walt Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Unlike many other Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants, Victor Rostow always spoke to his children in English rather than Yiddish as he felt this would improve their chances in life. Rostow&#x27;s brother Eugene, who was named for Socialist Party of America leader Eugene V. Debs, became a legal scholar, and his brother Ralph, a department store manager. The American journalist Stanley Karnow described Rostow as extremely intelligent with a &quot;brilliant&quot; academic record that saw him graduate from high school at the age of 15. Rostow described his childhood as mostly happy with the only dark spots being that sometimes his classmates called him and his brothers &quot;dirty Jews&quot;.

Rostow&#x27;s parents closely followed events in Russia and Rostow later recalled a defining moment of his life occurred as a teenager when his parents invited over for a dinner a group of fellow Jewish socialists together with a man who was serving as a purchasing agent for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. After the dinner, Rostow remembered that his father said: &quot;These communists took over the Tsarist police and made them worse. The Tsarist police persecuted the political opposition but never touched their families. These people touch families too. Nothing good will come of it&quot;. Rostow entered Yale University at the age of 15 on a full scholarship and graduated at 19. He then won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford, where he completed a B.Litt. degree. At Oxford, Rostow became friends with future British politicians Edward Heath and Roy Jenkins, being especially close to the latter. In 1936, during the Edward VIII abdication crisis, he assisted broadcaster Alistair Cooke, who reported on the events for the NBC Radio Network. After returning to Yale University, completing his PhD in 1940, he started teaching economics at Columbia University.

==Professional and academic career==
During World War II, Rostow served in the Office of Strategic Services under William Joseph Donovan. Among other tasks, he participated in selecting targets for US bombardment. Nicholas Katzenbach later joked: &quot;I finally understand the difference between Walt and me [...] I was the navigator who was shot down and spent two years in a German prison camp, and Walt was the guy picking my targets.&quot; In September 1942, Rostow arrived in London to serve as an intelligence analyst with the Enemy Objectives Unit, serving until the spring of 1945.

In January 1943, Rostow was given the task of identifying the key industries that supported the German war economy. As an intelligence analyst, Rostow became convinced in 1943 that oil was Germany&#x27;s Achilles heel, and if the United States Army Air Force were to target the Romanian oil fields together with the plants for making artificial oil and oil storage facilities within Germany itself, then the war would be won, a strategy known as the &quot;Oil Plan&quot;. By early 1944, Rostow had finally won over General Carl Spaatz to the merits of the &quot;Oil Plan&quot;. In early 1944, there was much debate about the merits of the &quot;Oil Plan&quot; vs. the &quot;Transportation Plan&quot; of targeting the German and French railroad system. The &quot;Transportation Plan&quot; was implemented first as part of the run-up to Operation Overlord. The &quot;Oil Plan&quot; began to be implemented as a strategy by the Army Air Force in May 1944, which Rostow later called a disastrous error, claiming if the &quot;Oil Plan&quot; had been adopted earlier, the war would have been won far earlier. He also claimed that the United States would have entered into the Cold War in a far stronger position as he always maintained that if &quot;Oil Plan&quot; had been adopted earlier it would have allowed the U.S. Armed Forces to push deeper into Central Europe and even into Eastern Europe. Based on his World War II experiences, Rostow became a convinced advocate of strategic bombing, arguing that it was the bombing campaign against Germany&#x27;s cities that had won the war. For his work with the Enemy Objectives Unit during the war, Rostow was awarded an OBE.

In 1945, immediately after the war, Rostow became assistant chief of the German-Austrian Economic Division in the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C. Rostow was invited to part in the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS), an assessment of the effects of the strategic bombing campaign on Germany&#x27;s economy, but he declined. Several of Rostow&#x27;s future foes in the 1960s such as George Ball, John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. did take part in the USSBS, and came away convinced that the strategic bombing campaign did not cripple the German economy as its advocates had promised, an experience that led these men to doubt the efficacy of bombing North Vietnam. Though the &quot;Oil Plan&quot; did indeed work as Rostow had promised, those taking part in the USSBS also noted that German industrial production peaked in December 1944, which led them to doubt the effects of strategic bombing as a way of breaking a nation&#x27;s economy. In 1946, he returned to Oxford as the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History. In 1947, he became the assistant to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, and was involved in the development of the Marshall Plan. One of Rostow&#x27;s colleagues recalled: &quot;In early 1946, Walt Rostow had a revelation that the unity of Germany could not be achieved without the unity of Europe, and that the unity of Europe could best be approached crabwise through technical cooperation in economic matters, rather than bluntly in diplomatic negotiations&quot;. Rostow&#x27;s writings on the subject of European economic unity attracted the attention of Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson, and ultimately Jean Monnet, the French diplomat regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the European Coal and Steel Community of 1951 that became the European Economic Community in 1957.

Rostow spent a year at Cambridge University as the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions. He was professor of economic history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1950 to 1961, and a staff member at the Center for International Studies (CIS) at the MIT from 1951 to 1961. The North Korean invasion of South Korea decisively altered Rostow&#x27;s thinking about the Soviet Union. Until the Korean War, Rostow had believed that the Soviet system would ultimately &quot;mellow&quot; on its own accord and he had also viewed the Cold War as a largely diplomatic conflict as opposed to a military struggle. The North Korean aggression against South Korea convinced him that the Cold War required a more militarized foreign policy as he called for greater defense spending in a speech in the fall of 1950 so a &quot;larger full mobilization could be carried out quickly.&quot; To pay for the higher amount of defense spending, Rostow urged the American people to accept the need for a &quot;very high level of taxation appropriated equally&quot;.

From late 1951 to August 1952, Rostow headed the Soviet Vulnerabilities Project. The project, which was sponsored by the CIS and received significant support from the U.S. government, sought to identify Soviet vulnerabilities with regard to political/psychological warfare, and it received contributions from top Sovietologist and psychological warfare specialists. In June 1955, Rostow headed a group of stalwart cold warriors who were called the &quot;Quantico Vulnerabilities Panel&quot; which issued a report that advocated nuclear coercion of the Soviet Union. Although the experts were invited by Nelson Rockefeller, their proposal ran contrary to the policy of the Eisenhower administration.

In 1954, Rostow advised President Dwight Eisenhower on economic and foreign policy, and in 1958 he became a speechwriter for him. In May 1954, Rostow was deeply shocked when he heard of the French Union defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, expressing his disgust that French leaders had failed to create a political alignment which would &quot;effectively rally the Vietnamese against the Communists&quot;. Rostow believed the Communist Viet Minh fighting for independence from France were a small, radical terrorist minority entirely unrepresentative of the Vietnamese people, the majority of whom he believed supported the French-dominated, but nominally independent State of Vietnam created in 1950. At the same time, he lashed out at Eisenhower for &quot;refusing to involve American units in combat&quot; as a plan had been drafted code-named Operation Vulture calling for the American intervention in the First Indochina War with tactical nuclear weapons. Eisenhower had Operation Vulture contingent upon British involvement, and when the British predictably refused to become involved, used that as an excuse not to execute Operation Vulture.

In August 1954, Rostow and fellow CIA-connected MIT economics professor Max F. Millikan convinced Eisenhower to massively increase US foreign aid for development as part of a policy of spreading what he saw as &quot;American-style&quot; economic growth in Asia and elsewhere, backed by the military. Unlike many of the first generation of &quot;Cold Warriors&quot; who saw the Cold War in essentially Euro-centric terms, Rostow viewed the Cold War as a global struggle in which the Third World was its most important battlefield. Rostow often accused people such as George F. Kennan and Dean Acheson of being racists because they viewed Europe as being far more important than Asia. On 26 February 1958, Rostow first met Senator John F. Kennedy, who was impressed with the academic who understood power. On 27 February 1958, Rostow appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where as prearranged, Kennedy asked him a question about American economic aid to India, which led to the reply the &quot;present aid program, which amounts to about $290 million this year, is grossly inadequate&quot;. The purpose of the testimony was to embarrass Eisenhower whom both men believed was neglecting the Third World. Rostow wrote two speeches for Kennedy, which he delivered on the Senate floor, attacking the Eisenhower administration for ignoring India, while the Soviet Union was not, and led ultimately India being granted $150 million in exchange credits from the Import-Export Bank later that year. In September 1958, Rostow left to take a professorship at Cambridge University, where he started writing his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a book intended to debunk Marxism as a theory that became &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot;. At a time when Nikita Khrushchev was boasting that the Soviet Union with its Five Year Plans would soon surpass the United States as the world&#x27;s dominant economic power because what he interpreted as Marxist theory explained both the past and the future, there was much desire in the American political and intellectual establishments to assess its ideological dimensions.

==&quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot;==

In 1960, Rostow published &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto&quot;, which proposed the Rostovian take-off model of economic growth, one of the major historical models of economic growth, which argues that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages of varying length: traditional society, preconditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and high mass consumption. This became one of the important concepts in the theory of modernization in social evolutionism. A product of its time and place, the book argued that one of the central problems of the Cold War as understood by American decision-makers, namely that there were millions of people living in poverty in the Third World whom Communism appealed to, could be solved by a policy of modernization to be fostered by American economic aid and growth. The book was highly influential, bringing modernization theory to prominence.

Rostow began the book with the question about where the world was going, asking &quot;Is it taking us to Communism, or the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?&quot; Using the Industrial Revolution in Britain as his case study, Rostow sought to rebut Karl Marx&#x27;s construction of history, arguing that Marx&#x27;s reading of British history, which he based much of his theories upon, was defective. The book was essentially a call for greater American involvement in the Third World as Rostow wrote that much of the Third World was struck in the &quot;traditional stage&quot; or &quot;preconditions for take-off&quot; stage, but with a little help from the US could reach the &quot;take-off&quot; stage. &quot;The Stages&quot; concluded: &quot;We must demonstrate that the underdeveloped nations ... can move successfully through the preconditions into a well established take-off within the orbit of the democratic world, resisting the blandishments and temptations of Communism. This is, I believe, the most important item on the Western agenda.&quot;.

Guy Ortolano argues that as an alternative to Marxist class-oriented analysis Rostow replaced class with nation as the agent of history. British history then became the base for comparisons. However Rostow never explicitly offered the British case as the ideal model for nations to copy. Many commentators assumed that was his goal and attention turned to issues of American exceptionalism, and the argument that Britain created the modern economy.

Rostow&#x27;s thesis was criticized at the time and subsequently as universalizing a model of Western development that could not be replicated in places like Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa. Another line of criticism was his thesis that societies based upon &quot;mass production&quot; and &quot;mass consumption&quot; like those of the West were the ideal society that everyone in the world wanted to emulate. At the time, critical reception was extremely favourable with a book review by Harry Schwarz in &quot;The New York Times&quot; speaking of Rostow&#x27;s &quot;impressive achievement&quot; of writing &quot;one of the most influential economic books of the twentieth century&quot;. In a review in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote: &quot;There is a sharp intelligence at work, producing paragraphs and pages which seem to distill events to an almost unbearable simplicity. This is the special quality of the writer and the book&quot;. Adlai E. Stevenson II wrote in a letter to Rostow: &quot;Is the future Rostowism vs. Marxism? If so, I am ready to vote now&quot;. Much of the success of &quot;The Stages&quot; at the time was due to the fact that it addressed seminal issues in a style that was easy to understand but was sufficiently intellectual enough not to be dismissed as facile and shallow. Like the various theories of Marxism that he had hoped to debunk, Rostow offered up a grand theory, in this case, the &quot;modernization theory&quot; that explained the past and predicted the future. The Swiss scholar Gilbert Rist wrote of &quot;Rostow&#x27;s marvelous fresco of humanity marching towards greater happiness&quot; and his theories as &quot;Marxism without Marx&quot; as Rostow asserted that capitalism was inevitably destined to triumph because, in his view, it was the superior system. The American historian Michael Shafer wrote about the modernization theory as &quot;a logical construct, deduced from a set of universal axioms abstracted from the realm of human and temporal contingencies&quot;.

In South Korea, at the time a Third World nation, much interest in Rostow&#x27;s book was expressed by both economists and policy-makers. Rostow&#x27;s concept of &quot;economic take-off&quot; especially appealed to the South Korean president, General Park Chung Hee, who often used that phrase in his speeches calling for South Koreans to work harder so that their nation could rise up to a First World economy. Park, who seized power in a 1961 coup d&#x27;état, starting in 1962 inaugurated a policy of five year plans under which the South Korean &quot;chaebol&quot; had to meet certain targets set by the government as part of the push to reach the &quot;economic take-off&quot; stage. A 1969 book &quot;Theory and Condition of Korean Economic Development&quot; published by the government had 17 essays by leading economists, of which half described sought to apply the theories set out in &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot; to South Korea.

==Service under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations==
&quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot; impressed presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who appointed Rostow as one of his political advisers, and sought his advice. After attempting unsuccessfully to be appointed to a major post under the Eisenhower administration, Rostow decided to try his luck with Kennedy in 1960. During the 1960 presidential election, Rostow served as a speech-writer and adviser for the Kennedy campaign, where he became known as an &quot;effervescent idea man&quot;. Rostow wrote the speech calling for a &quot;New Frontier&quot;, which Kennedy gave at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. The favorable reception to the &quot;New Frontier&quot; speech led Kennedy to promise Rostow a senior position if he won the election. Rostow also coined the slogan of Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 campaign &quot;Let&#x27;s Get the Country Moving Again&quot;. Initially, Kennedy wanted to give Rostow a major post in his administration. After Rostow wrote a policy paper in December 1960 to outline the incoming Kennedy administration&#x27;s &quot;flexible response&quot; nuclear posture to replace the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s &quot;massive retaliation&quot; nuclear doctrine, in which he stressed that the United States should be willing to use nuclear weapons in Southeast Asia to counter a &quot;possible breakout&quot; by China, the man whom Kennedy nominated to serve as his secretary of state Dean Rusk, vetoed Rostow&#x27;s appointment.

When Kennedy became president in 1961, he appointed Rostow as deputy to his national security assistant McGeorge Bundy. Though Rostow was just Bundy&#x27;s deputy, in practice he served as an equal as initially Kennedy was greatly influenced by the advice he received from the renowned, world famous economist. Just before Kennedy was inaugurated as president on 20 January 1961, on 6 January 1961, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech in Moscow declaring that the Soviet Union was allegedly able and willing to support any &quot;war of national liberation&quot; anywhere in the Third World. Khrushchev&#x27;s speech was largely a response to the Sino-Soviet split of 1960 as Mao Zedong had accused Khrushchev of &quot;revisionism&quot; and denounced the Soviet Union for not supporting Third World anti-colonial and nationalist movements. As such, Mao announced that he regarded himself as the proper leader of the world Communist movement, causing Khrushchev to strike back with his speech in Moscow announcing his willingness to support &quot;wars of national liberation&quot;. Missing the context of Sino-Soviet rivalry, Kennedy and his advisers regarded Khrushchev&#x27;s speech as a bold new Soviet gambit for world domination, making the subject of the Third World a key concern for him. The first meeting of the National Security Council under Kennedy on 28 January 1961 was entirely devoted to the subject of the Third World with the president reading out excerpts of Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;wars of national liberation speech&quot; to underline the danger. Rostow, who always saw the Third World as the main &quot;battlefield&quot; of the Cold War, enjoyed much influence with the new president at first. As the apostle of the modernization theory, Rostow laid out policies to counter Communism in the Third World.

Rostow supported the Bay of Pigs invasion, albeit with reservations, arguing the existence of a Communist government in Cuba was unacceptable as otherwise the rest of Latin America might be &quot;infected&quot; with Communism. Along the same lines, Rostow was the main inspiration for the Alliance for Progress, a $20 billion aid program for Latin America launched with great fanfare by Kennedy in 1961 who in a speech written by Rostow spoke of how the Alliance for Progress would allow Latin America to reach the &quot;economic take-off&quot; stage of growth by having an annual growth rate of 2.5% (a target chosen by Rostow), which would end the appeal of Communism in Latin America forever. Rostow was also instrumental in persuading Kennedy that the best way to fight Communism in the Third World in general, not just Latin America, was to increase aid, and in 1961 American aid to the rest of the Third World went up to $4.5 billion from $2.5 billion in 1960. In a speech written by Rostow, Kennedy announced that the 1960s would be the &quot;Decade of Development&quot;, saying that the United States was willing and able to furnish sufficient foreign aid to allow the Third World nations to reach the &quot;economic take-off&quot; stage.

Rostow annoyed Kennedy as an &quot;idea-a-minute man&quot;, causing him to complain that Rostow had too many ideas for his own good and was unable to focus on what was really important. Kennedy&#x27;s main complaint was that Rostow would in a rapid-fire fashion offer up a deluge of ideas, which made him hard to follow. Kennedy had come into the White House in January 1961 as a confirmed hawk, who during the 1960 election had criticized Eisenhower as &quot;soft on Communism&quot; for not overthrowing Fidel Castro, but the disaster of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April had cooled his martial ardor. After the Bay of Pigs invasion, he came to distrust the hawkish advice he received from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As a result, Kennedy also rejected the hawkish advice he received from Rostow, charging the experts had all told him that the Bay of Pigs invasion could not possibly fail. Just after the Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy rejected advice from Rostow to send U.S. troops to intervene in the Laotian Civil War. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith advised his friend Kennedy that Laos was not worth a war, and Kennedy himself noted to supply forces in Laos would present severe logistical problems. Finally remembering how the approach of American forces upon the Yalu river led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, the president was concerned that intervening in Laos would cause a war with China that he did not want. Instead, Kennedy sent the diplomat W. Averell Harriman to negotiate an agreement to &quot;neutralize&quot; Laos, which marked the beginning of the feud between Rostow and Harriman as the former started to see the latter as an appeaser.

Kennedy also charged that Rostow was too fixated on Vietnam, saying he seemed to have an obsession with that country as he spent much time talking about Vietnam. Rostow believed in the &quot;Domino Theory&quot;, predicating that if South Vietnam fell, the rest of Southeast Asia would also fall like so many dominoes, and ultimately India would fall as well. As early as June 1961, Rostow was advising Kennedy to bomb North Vietnam. During the Berlin crisis of 1961, Rostow advised Kennedy: &quot;We must find ways of putting pressure on Khrushchev&#x27;s side of the line with conventional forces or other means...We must begin now to present Khrushchev with the risk that if he heightens the Berlin crisis, we and the West Germans may take action that will cause East Germany to come unstruck&quot;. The particular action that Rostow advised Kennedy to take was to &quot;take and hold a piece of territory in East Germany that Khrushchev may not wish to lose (for example, Magdeburg)&quot;. Kennedy rejected this advice as too dangerous, stating that having U.S. forces seize part of East Germany would almost certainly cause a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Later that year, Rostow became Director of the State Department&#x27;s Policy Planning Staff. At the time, Kennedy commented: &quot;Walt is a fountain of ideas; perhaps one in ten of them is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately six or seven are not merely unsound, but dangerously so. I admire his creativity, but it will be more comfortable to have him creating at some remove from the White House.&quot;

Kennedy told Rostow that his being demoted from the White House to the State Department was because: &quot;Over here in the White House we have to play with a very narrow range of choices...We can&#x27;t do long-range planning; it has to be done over there. I want you to go over there and catch hold of the process at the level where it counts&quot;. Appealing to Kennedy&#x27;s Catholicism, Rostow complained that: &quot;I am going from being a priest in Rome to being a bishop in the provinces.&quot; In October 1961, Rostow went on a fact-finding mission with General Maxwell Taylor to South Vietnam and he returned full of enthusiasm for greater American involvement in what he stated &quot;might be the last great confrontation&quot; with Communism. The report that Taylor and Rostow wrote advocated that Kennedy send between 6,000 and 8,000 U.S Army troops to fight in South Vietnam under the guise of being &quot;flood relief workers&quot;. Kennedy rejected the Taylor-Rostow report&#x27;s recommendation that he send troops to fight in South Vietnam, but accepted the report&#x27;s other recommendations calling for more military and economic aid to South Vietnam. Karnow described Rostow as a man who &quot;seemed to revel in the war&quot; as it appeared that he wanted to prove that a short, bald, bespectacled New York intellectual could be just as hard, tough and macho as the idealized World War II veteran that Hollywood kept portraying in action films at the time. Rostow had served in World War II as an intelligence analyst with the task of selecting bombing targets in Germany, an important, but comfortable &quot;desk job&quot; that ensured he never saw combat, a point about which he was very sensitive.

In February 1962, President Ngo Dinh Diem introduced the strategic hamlet program of forcibly relocating peasants to strategic hamlets as a way of severing the population from the Viet Cong guerrillas. Though impetus for the Strategic Hamlet Program came from Diem, Rostow supported the program as a way of breaking down the &quot;traditional person&quot;, arguing that the strategic hamlets would be agents of modernization. He remained baffled as to why the strategic hamlets were so unpopular with South Vietnamese peasants. In 1962, Rostow drafted the statement of Basic National Security Policy (BNSP), a 284-page document meant to outline the foreign policy of the Kennedy administration. Reflecting his interest in the modernization theory, Rostow identified the Third World, especially &quot;the arc from Iran to Korea&quot; as the most important &quot;battlefield&quot; of the Cold War. Through to some extent based upon the theory of &quot;containment&quot; as argued by George F. Kennan in the 1940s, Rostow&#x27;s BNSP argued for the United States to promote economic growth in the Third World and for the creation of &quot;a wider community of free nations, embracing Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East&quot;. Kennan, who was serving as the US ambassador in Belgrade at the time, reviewed the BNSP and vigorously criticized the document. Kennan attacked Rostow&#x27;s advocacy of a winnable nuclear war, writing he would &quot;rather see my children dead&quot; than live in a world devastated by nuclear war. Kennan also criticized Rostow&#x27;s optimism about progress in the Third World, writing that the Third World was hopelessly backward and might be a danger to the US if allowed to progress. However, some of the statements in Kennan&#x27;s critique, where he argued that a First World standard of living was &quot;peculiar to peoples who have had their origins on or near the shores of the North Sea&quot; or to nations descended from such peoples like the United States allowed Rostow to accuse Kennan with some justification of racism.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Rostow was mostly excluded from the decision-making process, having only one meeting with Kennedy during the crisis where he advised him to stop Soviet ships carrying oil to Cuba, advice that was not taken. Unaware that Kennedy had promised not to invade Cuba and to pull American missiles out of Turkey as part of the resolution, Rostow saw the Cuban Missile Crisis as a triumph, which proved the superior power of the United States. Inspired by the Cuban Missile crisis, Rostow on 28 November 1962 called in a memo for the bombing of North Vietnam, writing: &quot;The whole lesson of the Cold War including the recent Cuba crisis is that Communists do not escalate in response to our actions&quot;. In 1962, Rostow started to advocate what became known in Washington as the &quot;Rostow Thesis&quot;, namely if the United States bombed North Vietnam along the same lines that Germany and Japan were bombed in World War II, then the North Vietnamese would have to cease trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.

In 1963, Rostow first advocated invading North Vietnam, arguing for American and South Vietnamese landings on the coast of North Vietnam as the prelude for reuniting Vietnam under the Saigon government. In a policy paper addressed to the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, W. Averell Harriman, dated 2 February 1963, that began with the sentence: &quot;Before you decide your old and respectful friend has gone off his rocker...&quot;, Rostow advocated invading North Vietnam. As the approach of U.S. troops to the Yalu River in 1950 led to the Chinese intervention in the Korean War, it was generally accepted within Washington that invading North Vietnam would likewise lead to a war with China. For this reason, Harriman was not impressed with Rostow&#x27;s paper and advised Kennedy to send Rostow back to his perch in academia, saying that Rostow was far too blasé about the possibility of a nuclear war with China. The Chinese nuclear program was well advanced by 1963, and in 1964 China exploded its first atomic bomb, followed by its first hydrogen bomb in 1967. Rostow underlined this consideration in a paper written in July 1963, stating it would be best to invade North Vietnam before the Chinese &quot;blow a nuclear device&quot;. Harriman was one of the richest men in the United States, who was very generous in donating to the Democratic Party, and as such served as a friend and adviser to every Democratic president from Roosevelt to Johnson. The persistence which Rostow advocated invading North Vietnam even after the first Chinese nuclear test in 1964 worried Harriman, and he consistently sought to curtail Rostow&#x27;s influence, making him into one of Rostow&#x27;s main enemies in Washington.

After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson promoted Rostow to McGeorge Bundy&#x27;s job after he wrote Johnson&#x27;s first State of the Union speech. Kennedy had generally ignored Rostow&#x27;s advice, but Johnson started to pay attention to him after he wrote a paper in February 1964 stating a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam would be enough to win the war. When the American ambassador to Laos, William H. Sullivan, wrote in February 1964 he did not believe a strategic bombing campaign would be decisive as the Viet Cong had a &quot;sustaining strength of their own&quot;, Rostow was ferocious, arguing the Viet Cong had no real basis of support in South Vietnam and only existed because North Vietnam was supporting them. The idea that Communism had an appeal to least some of South Vietnam&#x27;s people was anathema to Rostow, who insisted that there was no civil war in South Vietnam and there was only a struggle between North Vietnam and South Vietnam.  

The papers Rostow wrote urged a policy of &quot;graduated&quot; pressure as the United States would steadily increase the level of bombing to such a point that it would ultimately lead to the destruction of North Vietnam&#x27;s nascent industry. Unlike most American decision-makers, who knew nothing of Vietnam&#x27;s history, Rostow had done much reading on the subject and had learned that over the centuries that Chinese elites considered Vietnam a lost province which they would one day reclaim (Vietnam had been a Chinese province from 111 BC to 938 AD), leading to a long series of Vietnamese-Chinese wars as successive Vietnamese emperors fought off attempts by the emperors of China to incorporate Vietnam into the middle kingdom. Knowing of the full depth of the Sino-Vietnamese enmity, Rostow reached the conclusion that Ho Chi Minh would not want his nation to draw too close to China, and as such, could not risk the destruction of North Vietnam&#x27;s industry, which would leave North Vietnam entirely dependent upon China. One of Rostow&#x27;s opponents, George Ball, argued that Ho&#x27;s Vietnamese nationalism would make him an Asian version of Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, a communist leader who wanted his nation to be independent of both Moscow and Beijing. Ball argued that South Vietnam was a poor and politically unstable ally that contributed little to American national security, and allowing Ho to reunify Vietnam would pose no danger to the United States. Rostow, by contrast, argued that South Vietnam was crucial to American national security, and to allow the first &quot;domino&quot; to fall would cause the other &quot;dominoes&quot; in Southeast Asia. In his mind, losing any nation to communism, even it was of the Titoist type was unacceptable.

Rostow championed the idea of Congress giving President Johnson the power to wage war in Southeast Asia, an idea that he first suggested in February 1964. Rostow pointed out in a memo to the president that the degree of escalation in the Vietnam war envisioned by the administration would pose constitutional and legal problems as the constitution gave Congress, not the president, the right to declare war; and the level of escalation envisioned would be a war in everything but name. Rostow&#x27;s solution to this problem was for Congress to pass a resolution giving the president the legal power to essentially wage a war in Vietnam.

When Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on 10 August 1964, which was the closest thing to a declaration of war that the United States had in Vietnam, Rostow was well pleased. About the Gulf of Tonkin incident that led to the resolution, Rostow later said: &quot;We don&#x27;t know what happened, but it had the desired effect&quot;. In the context of the 1964 election, Johnson found the idea of a gradual process of escalating American involvement in Vietnam appealing as it allowed him to present both as a &quot;tough&quot; president while also less extreme than the Republican opponent, Senator Barry Goldwater. Rostow&#x27;s consistent advocacy of strategic bombing against North Vietnam as the decisive way to win the war endeared him to Johnson as it promised a &quot;cheap&quot; victory that would not cost too many American lives. In November 1964, Rostow advised Johnson to commit U.S. ground forces to Vietnam to prove that &quot;we are prepared to face down any form of escalation&quot; and to send &quot;massive&quot; naval and air forces to strike North Vietnam and, if necessary, China as well. In a memo to Johnson, Rostow wrote: &quot;They [the Vietnamese Communists] will not actually accept a setback until they are sure that we mean it&quot; and needed to know that &quot;they now confront a LBJ who has made up his mind&quot;.

Political scientist Charles King writes of Rostow&#x27;s tenure in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations,nearly every strategic move Rostow advocated turned out to be wrong, from escalating the commitment of U.S. combat troops for South Vietnam to rejecting peace talks with the North Vietnamese. Since he continued to defend those positions after most other people had concluded they were mistakes, his name became a byword for a specific kind of Washington virtue: offering terrible advice but at least doing so consistently.

==National Security Advisor==
As national security advisor, Rostow was responsible for developing the government&#x27;s policy in Vietnam, and he was convinced that the war could be won, becoming Johnson&#x27;s main war hawk and playing an important role in bringing Johnson&#x27;s presidency to an end. Rostow was extremely close to Johnson, later recalling:Johnson took me into his house as well as his staff, into his family; took my family in as well. It was an open-hearted, human relationship. I came to hold the greatest possible affection for him, love for him, as well as respect for the job. I had an enormous compassion for what he was bearing during those years, for what the family was bearing. At the time the appointment of Rostow as National Security Advisor was well received by almost all of the American media, praising Johnson for appointing such an eminent economist and historian to advise him. In an editorial &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Rostow was:a scholar with an original mind as well as an experienced official and policy planner ... one of the architects of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s foreign policy ... Mr. Rostow, of course, will be only one of the President&#x27;s principal advisers, and Mr. Johnson will make his own decisions. But the appointment places beside the President an independent and cultivated mind that, as in the Bundy era, should assure comprehension both of the intricacies of world problems and of the options among which the White House must choose. No President could ask for more. Johnson stated at the time that: &quot;I&#x27;m getting Walt Rostow as my intellectual. He&#x27;s not your intellectual. He&#x27;s not Bundy&#x27;s intellectual. He&#x27;s not Schlesinger&#x27;s intellectual. He&#x27;s not Galbraith&#x27;s intellectual. He&#x27;s going to be my Goddamn intellectual!&quot; Johnson, because of his origins as a man from the impoverished, harsh world of Texas who spoke his English with a heavy Texas twang and who had rather crude manners, always felt a certain sense of inferiority when dealing with patrician Ivy League intellectuals such as McGeorge Bundy, Arthur Schlesinger and John Kenneth Galbraith, who all served under Kennedy. Kennedy and his closest advisers always regarded Johnson as &quot;white trash&quot; from Texas, a vulgar man whose company had to be endured rather than enjoyed. Johnson felt that Rostow&#x27;s status as a Jewish intellectual from New York who likewise worked his way up from poverty made him into a kindred soul in a way that &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s intellectuals&quot; never could be for him. One of Johnson&#x27;s favorite advisers, Jack Valenti, recommended Rostow to the president.

Johnson&#x27;s background growing up poor on a farm in Texas left him with a sympathy for the underprivileged, and he was very interested in Rostow&#x27;s plans for Third World development. Rostow later recalled about Johnson: &quot;he was always for the underdog&quot;. Although Johnson believed that Africa was a hopeless disaster, he had great hopes for developing Latin America and Asia, remembering how the New Deal infrastructure projects of the 1930s had transformed Texas, until then a very backward state. As Rostow&#x27;s specialization was the subject of the economic modernization of the Third World, his area of expertise appealed to the president, who often talked grandly of his plans to bring electricity to the rural areas of South Vietnam as the necessary prelude to ending poverty in South Vietnam. Finally, Rostow&#x27;s consistently optimistic appraisal of the Vietnam war appealed to Johnson while his reputation as a hardliner was meant to signal that Johnson was prepared to do whatever it took to win the war. The abrasive Johnson, who was notorious within Washington for mistreating his staff, &quot;initiated&quot; Rostow by humiliating him by first leaking news of his appointment to the press, and then calling up to accuse him of being the leak. After unleashing a torrent of obscenities and screaming at him, the president hung up the phone without giving Rostow a chance to reply. Johnson always &quot;initiated&quot; his staff by humiliating them in some way to assert his dominance, and Rostow seems not to have taken it personally.

Rostow consistently argued to Johnson that any effort at a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam War would be &quot;capitulation&quot;. In his reports to Johnson, Rostow always put the emphasis on information that portrayed the United States as winning, becoming Johnson&#x27;s favourite adviser on foreign affairs. The optimistic reports that the hawkish Rostow wrote were much preferred by the president to the more pessimistic reports written by the &quot;doves&quot; in the administration. A typical memo from Rostow on 25 June 1966 read: &quot;Mr. President, you can smell it all over. Hanoi&#x27;s operation, backed by the Chicoms [Chinese Communists], is no longer being regarded as the wave of the future out there. U.S. power is beginning to be felt&quot;. The Ambassador-At-Large W. Averell Harriman called Rostow &quot;America&#x27;s Rasputin&quot; as he considered him to have a sinister power over Johnson&#x27;s mind, as he always pressed the president to take a harder line on Vietnam against the advice of his more dovish staff, Harriman included. Johnson was not enthusiastic about the Vietnam War, later telling his biographer Doris Kearns in a very gendered language that the Great Society was &quot;the woman I really loved&quot; while the Vietnam War was &quot;that bitch of a war on the other side of the world&quot;. As a president, Johnson had often in private complained that he much rather focus on his &quot;Great Society&quot; program intended to end poverty and racism in America and that the Vietnam War was an unwanted distraction. Given these views, Harriman found it mystifying that Johnson should shun his advice about finding a way for the United States to gracefully exit Vietnam while accepting the counsel of Rostow.

Johnson remembered how the &quot;Loss of China&quot; in 1949 had badly damaged the Democratic administration of Harry S. Truman who was excoriated by the Republicans as &quot;soft on communism&quot; and criminally negligent in allowing the &quot;loss of China&quot;, attacks that resonated with the American people at the time. Johnson once told a reporter Joseph Kraft, in an &quot;off-the-record&quot; conversation: I knew that Harry Truman and Dean Acheson had lost their effectiveness from the day the Communists took over China. I believe that the loss of China had played a large role in the rise of Joe McCarthy. And I knew that all these problems, taken together, were chickenshit compared with what might happen if we lost Vietnam ... I don&#x27;t give a damn about these little pinkos on the campuses, they&#x27;re just waving their diapers and bellyaching because they don&#x27;t want to fight. The great black beast for us is the right wing. If we don&#x27;t give this war over soon they&#x27;ll put enormous pressure on us to turn it into an Armageddon and wreck all our other programs. Johnson was fearful that if he allowed the &quot;loss of Vietnam&quot;, it would cause a similar right-wing backlash that would allow a &quot;reactionary&quot; Republican to win the presidency and for the GOP to take control of Congress, and together they would end his Great Society program along with the rest of Johnson&#x27;s civil rights legislation. Much of Rostow&#x27;s influence on Johnson was due to his insistence that to protect his domestic achievements that Johnson had to fight the Vietnam war, and moreover that the war was eminently winnable provided that the correct policies were followed. For Johnson, Rostow offered him a way out of an unpleasant situation of fighting a war in Vietnam that he rather not fight to protect the Great Society by promising him what Rostow insisted was a path to victory, as Rostow noted that presidents who win wars were usually also popular presidents.

In particular, Rostow persistently argued to the president that a programme of sustained bombing would force North Vietnam to cease its support of the Viet Cong and thus win the war. Rostow believed that strategic bombing alone would be enough to force North Vietnam to capitulate, and became the main advocate in the White House of Operation Rolling Thunder, the bombing offensive launched against North Vietnam in February 1965. Initially, Rostow believed in only bombing certain targets as a way of warning Hanoi to cease supporting the Viet Cong, but he changed his mind, coming to favour an all-out bombing offensive that would completely destroy the economy of North Vietnam. Reflecting the lessons of the Oil Plan, Rostow in particular believed that the destruction of the North Vietnamese oil storage facilities and the hydroelectric grid would so economically cripple North Vietnam that the war would be won, and he pressed Johnson to end the restrictions on bombing oil shortage tanks and hydro plants. Rostow was opposed by Harriman, who like him had spent much of World War II living in England; however, Harriman had first-hand observed how German bombing of British cities had hardened the will of the British public, and he now argued that American bombing on North Vietnam was having the same effect on the North Vietnamese public. The fact that Rostow had arrived in London in fall of 1942, when the worse of the German bombing was over, while Harriman as a special envoy for President Franklin D. Roosevelt had witnessed first-hand the &quot;Blitz&quot; against London and other British cities in the winter of 1940–41 contributed to their differing assessments of the effects of bombing. Based on his experiences in wartime, Harriman called the Rostow Thesis &quot;the stick without the carrot&quot;.

The first crisis that confronted Johnson and Rostow was the Buddhist Uprising in South Vietnam where an attempt by Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ to dismiss General Nguyễn Chánh Thi led to a civil war within the civil war as units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam fought one another, much to the consternation of Johnson who could not believe that America&#x27;s allies in South Vietnam were fighting each other. Rostow for his part advised the president to fully support Kỳ, charging that the Buddhist Struggle Movement which had rallied behind Thi was being used by the Communists. Rostow told Johnson: &quot;We are faced with the classic revolutionary situation-like Paris in 1789 and St. Petersburg in 1917&quot;. Rostow claimed that the Buddhists were just being used by the Viet Cong just as Lenin used Kerensky to take power in 1917, but fortunately American forces were there to save the day. Rostow concluded: &quot;In the face of defeat in the field and Kerensky&#x27;s weaknesses, Lenin took over in November. This is about what would happen in Saigon if we were not there, but we are there&quot;. As the civil war within the civil war between Kỳ and Thi greatly disturbed Johnson, Rostow&#x27;s advice to side with Kỳ was decisive. The fact that Kỳ expressed much admiration for Hitler, who in his own words was his &quot;only hero&quot; apparently did not offend Rostow. One of Rostow&#x27;s aides later wrote &quot;Rostow was like Rasputin to a tsar under siege&quot;. Rostow&#x27;s opponent, George Ball wrote about Rostow&#x27;s influence: &quot;He played to Johnson&#x27;s weaker side, always creating an image of Johnson standing against the forces of evil. He used to tell him how Lincoln was abused by everybody when he was at a certain stage of the Civil War...He spent a great deal of time creating a kind of fantasy for the president&quot;. In August 1966, Harriman warned Rostow against escalating the war to the brink of a nuclear war with China to best preserve life on plant Earth, only to be told &quot;it is only in extreme crises that such settlements will come&quot;.

At one point in 1966–67, the hawkish Rostow advocated that the United States invade North Vietnam, even if it meant war with China, a course of action that McNamara rejected as likely to cause a nuclear war. Rostow always maintained that had his advice to the president to invade North Vietnam been taken in 1966 or 1967, the war would have been won, telling Karnow in an interview in 1981 that he was disappointed that Johnson rejected his advice to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how the approach of American forces upon the Yalu river in 1950 led to China intervening in the Korean War, and he was very fearful that an American invasion of North Vietnam would once again lead to a war with China, which now had nuclear weapons. For this reason, Johnson was always against invading North Vietnam as the risks of a nuclear war with China were too awful for him to consider. Through Rostow was disappointed that Johnson rejected his advice to invade North Vietnam, he knew better than to stridently press that idea as that would annoy the president, and instead he brought up the idea of invading North Vietnam every so often a couple of months after Johnson last rejected it. Rostow also chaired a secret &quot;psychological strategy committee&quot; whose purpose was to supply &quot;correct facts&quot; about the Vietnam war to Congress, the media, and the American people in general.

In June 1966, Janusz Lewandowski, the Polish delegate to the International Control Commission, which was supposed to police the Geneva Accords of 1954, contacted Giovanni D&#x27;Orlandi, the Italian ambassador to South Vietnam, with a peace offer. Lewandowski stated he just spoken with Ho Chi Minh, whom he claimed wanted a &quot;political compromise&quot; to end the war and would go &quot;quite a long way&quot; for such a settlement. Lewandowski reported that Ho was willing to drop his demand that the government of South Vietnam be overthrown, though he preferred that somebody else other than Air Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky serve as premier; asked only the National Liberation Front (better known as the Viet Cong) &quot;take part&quot; in negotiations, instead of serving in the government; and were willing to accept a &quot;reasonable calendar&quot; for the withdrawal of American forces instead demanding their immediate pull-out. The Ambassador-at-Large Harriman and his deputy, the former CIA agent Chester Cooper, were intrigued by the Polish offer, which was backed by the Soviet Union. Ever since 1960, Mao Zedong had been accusing the Soviet Union of capitulating to capitalism and abandoning its principles, and a Sino-Soviet competition had broken out about which of the two states was most willing to support North Vietnam. Lewandowski stated that the Soviets were tired of this economically exhausting competition because every time China increased its support for North Vietnam, the Soviets had to increase their support on an even greater scale just to rebut the Chinese claim that they were &quot;selling out&quot;.

D&#x27;Orlandi was able to arrange for Lewandowski to meet Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the U.S. ambassador in Saigon, and the talks went well. By November 1966, it was arranged that John Gronouski, the American ambassador in Warsaw, would meet with North Vietnamese diplomats the next month for peace talks in what was code-named Operation Marigold. By December 1966, United States Air Force aircraft bombed oil facilities and railroad yards in Hanoi, which led the Poles to warn if the U.S. continued to bomb Hanoi, the talks would be aborted. Rostow told the president that he believed that Operation Marigold was a &quot;trap&quot; and the North Vietnamese demand that Hanoi not be bombed anymore showed the bombing campaign was indeed working as he promised it would. On December 6, 1966, Johnson refused Harriman&#x27;s request to cease bombing Hanoi and a week later, the planned talks in Warsaw were cancelled as the North Vietnamese announced that there would be no peace talks as long as North Vietnam was being bombed. In January 1967, Rostow reported to Johnson that the Viet Cong were &quot;disintegrating&quot; under the American pressure, writing optimistically that the major problem for the Americans in the coming year would be to find the best way to integrate those Viet Cong guerrillas who had surrendered back into civilian life. In a further hopeful sign he reported to the president in the same month that the bloody chaos of the Cultural Revolution had pushed China to the brink of civil war as &quot;Mao&#x27;s own prestige has been seriously, perhaps irretrievably, tarnished in this yet unavailing fracas&quot;. With China collapsing into chaos, he believed that the Chinese would be limited in their ability to support North Vietnam for some time to come. In fact, Mao continued to support North Vietnam during the war with the war serving as a foreign policy counterpart to the Cultural Revolution as the &quot;Great Helmsman&quot; believed that extreme violence was necessary to maintain Communist &quot;purity&quot;. The fact that some of Mao&#x27;s targets in the Cultural Revolution such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were opposed to increased aid to North Vietnam, preferring that the money be spent on Chinese development instead, gave him an additional reason to support North Vietnam.

In November 1966, the Israeli Defense Force raided the village of Samu&#x27; in the Jordanian-occupied West Bank, a move which angered Rostow as he told the Israeli ambassador Abba Eban that King Hussein of Jordan was an American ally and Johnson very strongly disapproved of the raid. Rostow stated: &quot;Israel for some Machiavellian reason, wanted a leftist regime on the Left bank [of Jordan] so that it could then have a polarized situation in which the Russians would be backing the Arabs and the U.S. backing Israel, and that Israel would not be in an embarrassing position where one of its friends among the Great Powers would also be a friend of an Arab country&quot;.

In February 1967, the Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited London, and the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson tried to act as a mediator to end the Vietnam war, offering to serve as an honest broker. Wilson had been asked in 1965 to send a British contingent to fight in Vietnam, but as his Labour Party was stoutly opposed to Britain fighting in Vietnam, he had refused, a move that the normally Anglophile Secretary of State Dean Rusk called a &quot;betrayal&quot;. To end a running sore in Anglo-American relations as Wilson was caught between the Americans who were pressuring him to send British forces to Vietnam and his own party who were pressuring not to, the prime minister was keen to end the Vietnam war. Kosygin told Wilson that Soviet influence in North Vietnam was limited as the North Vietnamese sought to play the Soviet Union off against China, but if the Americans were willing to cease their bombing of North Vietnam, the Soviet government would indeed pressure Ho Chi Minh to open peace talks. Speaking on what he thought was a secure telephone line from the Soviet embassy in London to the Kremlin, Kosygin told the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev that there was a &quot;great opportunity for peace&quot;, through in the same call he admitted that the militant, ultra-leftwing line taken by China would pose problems. Unknown to Kosygin, MI5 had tapped the telephone line and a translated transcript of his call to Brezhnev was forwarded to Wilson. The transcript convinced Wilson that Kosygin was negotiating in good faith, and the prime minister then contracted the Americans. American decision-makers tended to exaggerate Soviet influence over North Vietnam, and Wilson&#x27;s message that Kosygin was willing to apply pressure on North Vietnam was seen by Johnson as potentially opening the door for peace. Johnson directed David K. E. Bruce, the U.S. ambassador to the court of St. James together with Harriman&#x27;s deputy Chester Cooper to work alongside Wilson in what was code-named Operation Sunflower. Rostow reminded Johnson of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;betrayal&quot; in not sending British forces to Vietnam and advised the president not to trust him. Rostow was extremely negative about Operation Sunflower, called Wilson a vain and dishonest man who was working to end the Vietnam war on terms unfavorable to the United States, and did his best to fan Johnson&#x27;s already strong dislike of Wilson. Johnson only approved of Operation Sunflower because it would be too politically embarrassing to turn an opportunity outright.

Working closely with Bruce and Cooper, Wilson presented a ceasefire offer to Kosygin on 11 February 1967 on behalf of the United States, which Kosygin promised would be passed on to Ho. A few hours later, Cooper left his hotel to attend a performance of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; while informing the hotel staff that he would be at the theater if any phone calls came in for him. Cooper was at the theater when he an usherette told him that there was an urgent call from Washington, saying that a Mr. Rostow wanted to speak with him at once. In his telephone call, Rostow attacked Cooper for the conciliatory tone of Wilson&#x27;s letter, which he called appeasement, and demanding it be rewritten to make it much tougher, a gesture that Cooper felt was meant to sabotage Operation Sunflower. As demanded by Rostow, a new letter with considerably more confrontational tone was given to Kosygin, which led him to accuse the British and Americans of negotiating in bad faith.

Wilson in a telephone call to Johnson complained that the letter as rewritten by Rostow had ruined the peace talks and caused &quot;a hell of a situation&quot;. Wilson charged that Kosygin had taken a major risk for peace in Vietnam that could have exposed him to criticism within the Politburo and certainly would have exposed him to criticism from the Chinese who constantly accused the Soviets of not doing enough to support North Vietnam, and he felt an opportunity for peace had been gratuitously squandered. Anxious to salvage something from Operation Sunflower, Wilson, Bruce and Cooper put forward a new offer to Kosygin on 12 February that the United States would cease the bombing of North Vietnam in exchange for no more North Vietnamese troops going down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Johnson added in the condition that North Vietnam had to respond to the offer by noon the next day, a deadline that Bruce called &quot;ridiculous&quot; and Kosygin left London the next day with nothing to show for his peace-making efforts.

Wilson blamed Rostow for the failure of Operation Sunflower, telling his Foreign Secretary George Brown: &quot;I suspect that Rostow himself was largely responsible for the misunderstandings during the Kosygin visit and may well have reported to the president in the light of responsibility&quot;. Karnow wrote it is no means certain that Wilson&#x27;s claim that a &quot;historic opportunity&quot; to end the war in Vietnam in 1967 had been squandered as all Kosygin was promising was to pressure Ho to accept a ceasefire and as he himself noted that when the Soviets pressured the North Vietnamese to do something that they did not want to do, they just drew closer to China. Soviet pressure on North Vietnam tended to most effective in conjugation with China, and in 1967 the Chinese were attacking the Soviets in the most violent terms, accusing them of abandoning true communism, making any possibility of Sino-Soviet pressure on North Vietnam most unlikely. Karnow wrote at most Operation Sunflower offered was a chance to begin negotiations to end the war, and Johnson and Rostow shunned that chance.

On 27 April 1967, General William Westmoreland asked for another 200,000 troops for South Vietnam, a request that was supported by Rostow. Rostow went further than Westmoreland by asking Johnson to invade North Vietnam, saying that the American people wanted their president &quot;do something big and hopefully decisive rather than small&quot;. At the meeting of the National Security Council, Rostow paced back and forth before a map of Vietnam with a pointer, showing the best way to invade while the Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara, countered him point by point, stating that the dangers of Chinese intervention were far too great. Rostow was so disappointed that Johnson was more influenced by McNamara than himself that he almost resigned in protest, before deciding as he put it to &quot;stay with Johnson until the last day, while steadily, but quietly opposed to the way the war was being fought&quot;.

In April 1967, the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. came out against the Vietnam War with a speech in New York denouncing the &quot;immoral war&quot; whose burden he charged fall disproportionately heavily on black men who more likely to be drafted to fight in Vietnam. King&#x27;s speech increased the sense of siege in the White House, and hence Rostow&#x27;s influence. In July 1967, allegations of police brutality led to race riots in Detroit and Newark. In response to the race riots, conservative Republicans and Democrats accused the Johnson administration&#x27;s civil rights reforms as being the root reason for the riots. Johnson ordered Rostow to collect &quot;such evidence as there is on external involvement in the violent radical community of the Negro community in the U.S&quot;. Johnson was apparently hoping that Rostow would find evidence that the Soviet Union and/or China were behind the riots in Detroit and Newark, but his national security adviser was unable to produce any such evidence. The fact that Rostow was ordered to investigate an essentially domestic matter showed that the president thought very highly of him. As the anti-war protests increased, Rostow was able to reassure Johnson that history will vindicate him, leading the president to remark he was &quot;a man of conviction who doesn&#x27;t try to play president&quot;.

Rostow was finally able to persuade Johnson in June 1967 to bomb North Vietnamese oil storage facilities and hydroelectric plants, arguing that this would cause the collapse of North Vietnam&#x27;s economy and win the war. By contrast, McNamara reported to the president in the summer of 1967 that even though American bombers by destroying hydroelectric plants had reduced North Vietnam&#x27;s capacity to generate electricity by 85%, it had failed to impact meaningfully on the war. McNamara argued to Johnson that Rostow did not understand the differences between Germany, an advanced, industrialized First World nation vs. North Vietnam, a backward, rural Third Nation nation, and that paradoxically that North Vietnam&#x27;s very backwardness was a form of strength. McNamara noted that even before the American bombing, the total annual hydroelectric production of North Vietnam amounted only to a fifth of the annual hydroelectric production produced by the Potomac Electric Power Company&#x27;s plant in Alexandria, Virginia. For this reason, McNamara stated that knocking out North Vietnam&#x27;s hydroelectric plants did not have the same catastrophic effect on the North Vietnamese economy that knocking out America&#x27;s hydroelectric plants would have had on the American economy. Likewise, North Vietnam imported all of its oil from the Soviet Union, and the North Vietnamese loaded drums of oil from Soviet tankers at sea to sampans, which then entered North Vietnam via that country&#x27;s intricate network of rivers and canals. For this reason, the destruction of North Vietnam&#x27;s oil shortage tanks by American bombers in 1967 did not affect North Vietnam&#x27;s capacity to wage war. The North Vietnamese developed a system of hiding the oil drums underground all across the country. Despite all of the devastation caused by the American bombing between 1965 and 1967 with ports destroyed and oil shortage tanks left burning, North Vietnam doubled its imports of Soviet oil, reaching an annual total of 1.4 million tons by 1967. The North Vietnamese built some 30, 000 miles of tunnels and underground storage areas during the war to escape the bombing. Rostow believed that the bombing tied down North Vietnamese men who might otherwise fight in the war by forcing them to engage in reconstruction work, but the North Vietnamese government had proclaimed a &quot;total war&quot;, mobilized the entire population for the war, and put women to work reconstructing the damage done by American bombers. Additionally, some 320,000 Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army soldiers served in North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968 to operate anti-aircraft guns and the SAMs (surface to air missiles) while rebuilding roads and bridges.

While working as national security advisor, Rostow became involved in setting the United States&#x27; posture towards Israel. Concerns about Israel&#x27;s nuclear program were tabled by the United States during the build-up to the Six-Day War and its aftermath. Although he supported military and economic assistance to Israel, Rostow believed that increased public alignment between the two states could run counter to US diplomatic and oil interests in the region. Rostow considered President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt to be a moderating force who through he talked belligerently of war, in fact kept the Arab-Israeli dispute &quot;in the icebox&quot;. Rostow wrote in a memo advocating American economic aid to Egypt: &quot;While no one likes the idea of paying off a bully, Nasser is still the most powerful figure in the Middle East...and has restrained wilder Arabs who have for a disastrous Arab-Israeli showdown&quot;. After reviewing the May 1967 report from the Atomic Energy Commission team that had inspected Dimona along with other intelligence, Rostow informed President Johnson that, though the team found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program, &quot;there are enough unanswered questions to make us want to avoid getting locked in too closely with Israel. When Egypt remilitarized the Sinai in May 1967, Rostow did not support an Israeli strike against Egypt, instead writing &quot;We sympathize with Eshkol&#x27;s need to stop these [Palestinian] raids and reluctantly admit that a limited attack on Syria may be his only answer&quot;. About the Egyptian remilitarization, Rostow wrote that goals of American policy must be &quot;(a) prevent Israel from being destroyed (b) stop aggression, and (c) to keep U Thant out in front and stiffen his spine&quot;. In this regard, Rostow wrote it was essential to persuade the Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol &quot;not to put a match to this fuse&quot;. On 22 May 1967, Nasser further escalated the crisis by closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, which was a provocation as Israel had always stated that they would go to war to keep the Straits of Tiran open.

When the Israelis claimed that Eisenhower had given Israel a security &quot;guarantee&quot; in 1957 to keep open the Straits of Tiran, a claim that mystified the Americans who had never heard of this &quot;guarantee&quot;, Rostow was tasked by Johnson to investigate. The answer was soon found; Eisenhower had written a letter to the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in 1957 committing the United States to &quot;guarantee&quot; that the Straits of Tiran would be kept open to Israeli shipping by the United States. Rostow had to inform the Israelis that only treaties ratified by Congress are binding on the United States, and presidential promises represent only a moral, not a legal commitment on the part of the United States. However, he was later to state: &quot;From the moment Eisenhower made clear that a commitment had been made, Johnson had no doubt that he had to reopen the Straits&quot;. Rostow backed the Regatta plan under which a group of various nations would sail their ships through the Strait of Tiran as a show of support for Israel. Rostow believed that the free passage of Israeli ships via the Straits of Tiran was a &quot;naked principle&quot; the United States should uphold even it meant a war with Egypt. As more and more nations backed out of the Regatta plan, Rostow came to take a more hawkish stance, saying to Johnson that Israel should move &quot;like a sheriff in &quot;High Noon&quot;&quot;, using violence &quot;necessary to achieve not merely self-respect, but respect in the region&quot;. However, Johnson did not favor war to resolve the crisis, but as he appeared to be backtracking from the Regatta plan, Eshkol wrote Johnson a letter noting that he had not invaded Egypt per American requests, but still the Straits of Tiran were closed to Israeli shipping. Johnson in his reply stated he only promised to use all of his constitutional powers to reopen the Straits of Tiran, noting that because of the Vietnam war, he could not risk getting involving in another war at present, telling Rostow to make that point clear to the Israelis. Rostow told the Israeli envoy Ephraim Evron sent to Washington that Johnson disliked the Israeli &quot;pressure tactics&quot; and needed more time to study the issues. Rostow informed Evron: &quot;You have known President Johnson for a long time and have a right to make your own assessment&quot;. Evron predicated that Israel would probably go to war if nothing was done to reopen the Straits of Tiran, telling Rostow that were &quot;about ten days&quot; of peace left.

Though Rostow, Johnson, and Secretary of State Dean Rusk tried to convince Israel not to resort to military force, they supported Israel once the war began. Rostow told the Egyptian ambassador, Mustafa Kamel just before the war: &quot;Your adversaries believe that a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria is imminent. We know this is unthinkable. We cannot believe the government of the UAR [United Arab Republic] would be so reckless. Such a course would obviously have the most serious possible consequences&quot;. Rostow added that Israel had also been given a similar &quot;friendly warning&quot; not to escalate. Shortly before the war began, Johnson asked Rostow what he thought Israel was going to do, leading Rostow to reply &quot;they&#x27;re going to hit&quot;. At about 4:35 am on 6 June 1967, Rostow phoned Johnson to tell him that Israel had just attacked Egypt with the Israeli Air Force striking Egyptian Air Force bases all over Egypt. On the first day of the Six Day War, Rostow submitted a report to Johnson about the destruction of the Egyptian Air Force that began: &quot;Herewith the account, with a map, of the first day&#x27;s turkey shoot&quot;. Later that day, Rostow in a memo to the president wrote &quot;we should begin...talking with the Russians and, if possible, with others about the terms of a settlement...A ceasefire will not answer the fundamental questions in the minds of Israelis until they have acquired so much real estate and destroyed so many Egyptian planes and tanks that they are absolutely sure of their bargaining position&quot;.

Once the war began, Rostow saw an opportunity for the United States, writing that the issue &quot;was whether the settlement of this war shall be on the basis of armistice agreements, which leave the Arabs in the posture of hostilities towards Israel, keeping alive the Israeli issue in Arab political life as a unifying force, and affording the Soviet Union a handle on the Arab world; or whether a settlement emerges in which Israel is accepted as a Middle Eastern state&quot;. Rostow believed that the possibility of Israel gaining territory would allow a &quot;land for peace&quot; deal which might finally end the Arab-Israeli dispute, which led him to advocate no ceasefire to end the war until Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria as he maintained the Syrians would never make peace until an initiative was provided. Rostow favored having a peace plan calling for &quot;land for peace&quot; deal to be issued by the United Nations, with the negotiations to be mediated by the United States. Rostow made it clear that he did not envision Israel permanently occupying the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Sinai, believing that an occupation would ensure that the Arab-Israeli conflict would never end. By the third day of the Six Day War, Israeli officials were starting to hint that they were not willing to give up some of their recent territorial gains, especially East Jerusalem. In October 1967, Rostow advised Johnson that with Israel &quot;we lean against them just enough to keep their thinking from becoming too quickly set in the concrete of their current extended territorial possessions&quot;. When the nuclear issue resurfaced in January 1968, just prior to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol&#x27;s visit to the United States, Rostow recommended that the president make it clear that the United States expected Israel to sign the NPT.

In September–October 1967, Operation Pennsylvania peace initiative was launched, when a professor of political science at Harvard, Henry Kissinger, got into contact with a French biologist, Herbert Marcovich, who in turns was friends with the French Resistance hero, Raymond Aubrac who was a friend of Ho Chi Minh. Aubrac and Marchovich visited Hanoi to meet Ho to discuss peace. Rostow was opposed to Operation Pennsylvania plan, and turn his best to turn Johnson against it. Under Rostow&#x27;s influence, Johnson sent a message to Kissinger: &quot;I&#x27;m going to give it one more try and if it doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m going to come up to Cambridge and cut off your balls!&quot; Kissinger contacted Rostow to urge that the U.S. pause the bombing to give Operation Pennsylvania a chance, only to be rebuffed. Kissinger was later to call Rostow a &quot;fool&quot;.

During the siege of Khe Sanh in January 1968, Rostow reported to President Johnson that the North Vietnamese were sending their forces to &quot;re-enact a new Dienbienphu&quot;, predicating that Khe Sanh would be the decisive battle in 1968 and the United States must commit all of its forces to prevent the fall of Khe Sahn. In this, Rostow was playing into North Vietnamese hands as the intention by Hanoi was to draw away American forces from the main cities of South Vietnam as the prelude for the Tet Offensive. During the Tet Offensive in 1968, Rostow in a report stated that a Vietcong attack against a remote village in South Vietnam had been timed to coincide with a debate in Congress about appropriations for the war, leading Karnow to sarcastically write &quot;as if tacticians in Hanoi consulted the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; before deploying their units&quot;. During the Tet offensive, Rostow urged Johnson to give a &quot;war leader speech&quot; in preference to a &quot;peace leader speech&quot;. In February 1968, Rostow clashed repeatedly with the CIA director, Richard Helms, who accused him of distorting intelligence to present a more optimistic picture of the war than was warranted.

During the debate in Washington in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive about whatever to send more troops to South Vietnam or not, Rostow argued that firmness in Vietnam was needed to deter &quot;aggression...in the Middle East, elsewhere in Asia and perhaps even in Europe&quot; and recommended that U.S. ground forces enter North Vietnam and Laos to sever the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Rostow urged Johnson that &quot;it is time for a war leader speech instead of a peace-seeker speech&quot;. In the aftermath of the Tet Offensive, Rostow argued that now was the time to finish off the Vietnamese Communists and urged Johnson to send 206,000 more American troops to South Vietnam to join the half-million already there and to bomb North Vietnam even harder. During the debates, the out-going Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, who had been repeatedly bested in debates by Rostow, snapped in fury: &quot;What then? This goddamned bombing campaign, it&#x27;s worth nothing, it&#x27;s done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn&#x27;t done a fucking thing!&quot; At that point, McNamara, who had become disillusioned with the war he had once supported, broke down in tears, asking Johnson plaintively to stop listening to Rostow and saying the war could not be won. Rostow had supported Johnson&#x27;s decision to appoint Clark Clifford as Defense Secretary as he was known to be a hawk, and was greatly dismayed when the new defense secretary turned out to be more of a dove than McNamara was.

Johnson was badly spooked by his near-defeat in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which he won by only 300 votes against the anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy, a politician whom many people did not take seriously. Even worryingly for Johnson, inspired by this display of presidential weakness in New Hampshire, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, a politician whom many people did take seriously, entered the Democratic primaries on an anti-war platform on 16 March 1968. For the Wisconsin Democratic primary scheduled for 2 April 1968, the polls in March 1968 showed Kennedy in the lead, McCarthy coming in second and Johnson humiliatingly coming in third. Faced with a situation where there was a real possibility of him losing the Democratic nomination to be his party&#x27;s candidate in the 1968 election, Johnson decided to consider a political as opposed to a military solution to the Vietnam war. Clifford had despite expectations turned out to be more dovish in office, and pressed the president to find an &quot;honorable way out&quot; of Vietnam. Johnson sought the advice of the so-called &quot;wise men&quot;, a group of elder statesmen who advised him to find a way to end the war. The leader of the &quot;Wise Men&quot;, the former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, told Rostow &quot;tell the president—and you tell him in precisely these words—that he can take Vietnam and stick it up his ass&quot;. On 25 March, when Johnson met the &quot;Wise Men&quot;, he was informed that &quot;we must take steps to disengage&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s highest level of education had been at the Southwest Texas Teacher&#x27;s College, and throughout his life, he had much respect for those with university degrees from the &quot;Eastern Establishment&quot;. Of the 14 &quot;Wise Men&quot;, only General Omar Bradley, Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, the diplomat Robert Murphy and General Maxwell Taylor favored fighting on with the other ten favoring disengagement.

During the 1968 election, Rostow did his best to sabotage the peace talks going on Paris as the American delegation led by his old enemy Harriman negotiated with the North Vietnamese in Paris. By this point, Rostow was consumed with hatred for Harriman, and he missed an opportunity to disparage to Johnson. On 3 April 1968, Rostow that Harriman should not head the American peace delegation to Paris because &quot;he lacks—and always lacked—an understanding and sympathy with the South Vietnamese&quot;. Through Johnson was sympathetic, he argued that Harriman&#x27;s record as a distinguished diplomat going back to World War II qualified him to head the delegation. Rostow attached to the peace delegation a staffer from the National Security Council, William Jorden, with orders &quot;to keep an eye on those bastards and make sure that they didn&#x27;t give away the family jewels&quot;.

Rostow changed his opinions to suit the president&#x27;s changed mood in the summer of 1968 and now advised Johnson to limit the bombing raids against North Vietnam. By the time of the Democratic convention in Chicago in August 1968, Rostow approved of the compromise campaign plank of the man who won the Democratic nomination, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, which called for an end of the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, as by this point he feared that the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, would win the election. By August 1968, the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart, divisions that were all too apparent at the Democratic convention where anti-war and pro-war Democrats vehemently debated on the convention floor about whatever the United States should continue fighting in Vietnam or not. Given the disarray in the Democratic ranks, it was widely felt if the party did not find a way of unifying itself, Nixon would win. When Humphrey asked for Rostow&#x27;s help with campaign slogans, Rostow came up with the awkward &quot;We&#x27;re not going to let a handful of white and black punks turn this country over to Wallace, Strom Thurmond, and those who base their campaigns on their support&quot;. By this, Rostow meant that a divided Democratic Party might allow people like George Wallace, the outspoken white supremacist former governor of Alabama who was running for president as a third-party candidate, or Senator Strom Thurmond, a Democrat who turned Republican out of his opposition to civil rights for Afro-Americans, would come to power.

Based upon information provided by the National Security Agency, which broken the South Vietnamese diplomatic codes, senior Johnson administration officials learned that Anna Chennault, the chairwoman of the Republican Women for Nixon group had met the South Vietnamese ambassador, Bùi Diễm, to tell him that South Vietnam should sabotage Paris peace talks to improve the chances of Nixon winning the election. On 29 October 1968, Rostow told Johnson he now had information &quot;on how certain Republicans may have inflamed the South Vietnamese to behave as they have been behaving&quot;. Rostow also advised Johnson not to go public with this information, saying he should instead tell Nixon in private to keep away from Chennault, advice which was taken. By the fall of 1968, Rostow had come to feel that it was better if Nixon won the election rather than the &quot;defeatist&quot; Humphrey who on the campaign trail had become increasingly critical of the war. In one of his memos to Johnson, Rostow, who was still unhappy about Johnson&#x27;s decision not to invade North Vietnam, wrote he should say if asked about civilian-military relations: &quot;Generally speaking, the military has wanted us to use more power, earlier and faster. They may have been right. But the president had other considerations to think of&quot;. It was a mark of Rostow&#x27;s influence that Johnson, who was well known for being abrasive towards subordinates, did not explode in rage as he would have if anyone else wrote such a memo. After the Watergate scandal, Rostow expressed regret for not outing the Nixon campaign for the Chennault Affair and expressed his belief that their success emboldened the Nixon administration to commit worse offenses during the 1972 presidential election.

==Public intellectual==
When Richard Nixon became president in 1969, Rostow left office, and over the next thirty years taught economics at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin with his wife Elspeth Rostow, who later became dean of the school. In 1969, he was told that because of his support for the Vietnam War that he was not welcome to resume teaching at MIT, forcing him to take up a position at the University of Texas. By 1968 the general consensus amongst the liberal American intelligentsia was that the Vietnam War was a horrific mistake of epic proportions and when Rostow left government service in January 1969, he found himself an unpopular figure with the liberal intelligentsia, making it impossible for him to return to MIT. Rostow&#x27;s biographer, the British historian David Milne, wrote: &quot;In 1969, Rostow&#x27;s notoriety was such that none of America&#x27;s elite universities were willing to offer him a job&quot;. For a man who had previously held professorships at Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, and MIT, it was considered within academic circles to be a real comedown for him to teach at the University of Texas at Austin.

He wrote extensively in defense of neoliberal economics, particularly in developing nations. Rostow&#x27;s successor as National Security Adviser, the Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, was obsessed with the fear of becoming &quot;this administration&#x27;s Walt Rostow&quot;. Kissinger wanted to resume his professorship at Harvard as he did not want to end up teaching at an &quot;unacceptable&quot; institution like the University of Texas as Rostow did.

Rostow himself noted that the University of Texas campus was ultra-modern as the Texas government had used its oil wealth to create a gleaming, modernistic campus, but complained that the university administration was more interested in supporting the football team, the Longhorns, than in research and teaching. From 1969 to 1971, Rostow served as one of the ghostwriters on Johnson&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Vantage Point&quot;, writing all of the chapters dealing with foreign affairs. As the teaching load at the University of Texas was very light, Rostow had much time for research and between 1969 and 2003 wrote 21 books, mostly on world economic history with a particular focus on economic modernization. In his own memoir, &quot;The Diffusion of Power&quot;, Rostow argued for the justice of the Vietnam War and lashed out at Kennedy for ignoring his advice in 1962 to invade North Vietnam, writing that this &quot;was the greatest single error of U.S foreign policy in the 1960s&quot;. Reflecting his friendship with Johnson, Rostow was less harsh towards him in his memoir, but still he charged that Johnson was too worried about the possibility of a nuclear war with China and should have taken his advice to invade North Vietnam, arguing that the risk of a nuclear war with China was acceptable. The main villain in &quot;The Diffusion of Power&quot; was McNamara, who Rostow accused of being a defeatist from 1966 onward, charging that it was his weakness and doubts about the war that caused Johnson to hold back and not invade North Vietnam.

In the 1980s, Rostow visited South Korea, whose economy had greatly industrialized under the rule of General Park. During his visit, Rostow praised South Korea as the best example of the theories he set out in &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot;, arguing that General Park&#x27;s policies had indeed pushed South Korea into an &quot;industrial take-off&quot;. In 1998, Rostow told the South Korean economist Park Taey-Gyun that the experience of South Korea proved the correctness of &quot;The Stages of Economic Growth&quot; and expressed the wish that more Third World leaders had been like General Park; though the economist Park noted that General Park&#x27;s policy of Five Year Plans did not reflect Rostow&#x27;s ideas.

In 1986, a book by Rostow &quot;The United States and the Regional Organization of Asia and the Pacific, 1965–1985&quot; was published. In this book, Rostow advanced the thesis that the United States had actually &quot;won&quot; the Vietnam War, as he contended the war had &quot;brought time&quot; for the rest of Southeast Asia to economically advance and escape Communism. Rostow based his argument along the contention that based on the ways things were going in South Vietnam in 1965 that the country would have fallen to the Communists that year, and the American intervention, which though it failed to save South Vietnam in the end, gave an extra ten years to allow the rest of Southeast Asia to economically advance, ensuring that the other &quot;dominoes&quot; did not fall. Rostow argued that the economic success of most of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which comprised Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, and the Philippines, was due to the Vietnam War &quot;buying time&quot; for them, as none of those nations ended up being communist and with the exception of the Philippines, all of them were &quot;Asian tigers&quot; (i.e. rapidly growing economies).

In 1995, McNamara published his memoir &quot;In Retrospect&quot; when he famously declared about the Vietnam War &quot;we were wrong, terribly wrong&quot;. On 9 June 1995 in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Rostow wrote a scathing review of &quot;In Retrospect&quot; under the title &quot;The Case for the War&quot;, where he accused McNamara of insulting all of the families of Americans who died in Vietnam and argued that the United States had in fact &quot;won&quot; the Vietnam War as the non-communist states of Southeast Asia &quot;had quadrupled their real GNP between 1960 and 1981&quot;, which Rostow argued would not have happened had the United States not fought in Vietnam. The review in &quot;The Times Literacy Supplement&quot; reflected the intense feud between McNamara and Rostow; the latter made much of the fact that McNamara often suffered from depression and suggested that his &quot;defeatism&quot; was due to an unsound mind. Rostow believed that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown in 1966 and his &quot;defeatism&quot; about Vietnam was due to the fact he had &quot;cracked&quot; under the strain of war. Milne wrote that it is indeed correct that McNamara suffered from bouts of depression, but there is nothing to support Rostow&#x27;s claim he had lost his mind as Defense Secretary. Milne also wrote that Rostow&#x27;s assertion that high economic growth rates in Southeast Asia justified the Vietnam War was callous towards the families of all the Americans and Vietnamese who died in the war.

==Honors and awards==
Rostow received the Order of the British Empire (1945), the Legion of Merit (1945), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1969). He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1957) and the American Philosophical Society (1983).

<doc id="713875" wikidata="Q1431086" url="?curid=713875" title="Charlottetown Airport">
<text>Charlottetown Airport is located north of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The airport is currently run by the Charlottetown Airport Authority, is owned by Transport Canada and forms part of the National Airports System.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by NAV CANADA and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. CBSA officers at this airport can handle aircraft with no more than 60 passengers or 368 if off-loaded in stages.

==History==

===Upton Field===
The first aircraft to operate in the Charlottetown area was one that landed at the exhibition grounds east of the city&#x27;s central business district in 1912; it was not until 1931 that a permanent airfield was built. The first facility was known as Upton Field (later Upton Airport) and consisted of two turf runways and respectively, opening on January 16, 1932. Upton was a farm located in the western part of Queens Royalty, northwest of the city proper. The airfield was leased to Canadian Airways Limited from October 9, 1932, to October 9, 1938, although the airfield was only licensed until June 30, 1938. Throughout this time, Upton Airport received the first air mail service in Canada.

Today the site is farmland and trees, and a popular area for walking dogs, hiking, cross country skiing, and other recreational activities.

===Municipal ownership and operation===
In June 1938, the city government asked the Department of Transport to assist in the development of an expanded municipal airport. Upton Airport was considered a candidate, as was a property east of Sherwood Station on the Brackley Point Road. Upton Airport was rejected due to lack of space, and the Sherwood Station property in the central part of Charlottetown Royalty was purchased by the city government for $30,000. The provincial government contributed 50% to the development of the new airport in exchange for 50% of its profits while the city would operate it.

===Military operation===

In December 1939, the city government offered the airport to the federal government for military use through the duration of World War II. The Royal Canadian Air Force expanded the airport and enlarged the runways in preparation for using the airport to train pilots and aircrew. The runways were altered into a classic triangle configuration seen with most British Commonwealth Air Training Plan aerodromes across Canada. The Royal Air Force used the airfield from June 15, 1941, until February 1944 during which time it was known as RAF Station Charlottetown. Following the departure of the RAF, the RCAF established training units at the airfield, which was renamed RCAF Station Charlottetown.

===Federal ownership and operation===

Following the end of World War II, the military presence at the airport diminished by late 1945 and the base was decommissioned and transferred from the RCAF to the federal Department of Transport on February 1, 1946, returning the airfield to civilian use.

Several expansions were subsequently undertaken, including an enlarged civilian air terminal off the Brackley Point Road on the west side of the airfield, as well as a lengthening and realigning of what would become runway 03/21 during the 1960s-1970s to accommodate jet aircraft. A major expansion during the 1980s saw the old terminal become a general aviation facility after a new terminal, control tower and emergency services building were constructed further to the north from a continuation of Sherwood Road. This also saw runway 03/21 lengthened to its current configuration.

Charlottetown Airport saw extensive service during the 1960s-1990s from both Air Canada and Eastern Provincial Airways (EPA) to destinations in Atlantic and Central Canada. Following EPA&#x27;s sale and merger with CP Air, Charlottetown Airport saw direct CP Air service from Central Canada for several years, continued by Canadian. The creation of Air Canada subsidiary Air Nova and Canadian subsidiary Air Atlantic saw the beginning of a downgrade in direct service by the major carriers from Central Canada and an increase in service from hub airports such as Halifax and Moncton.

The opening of the Confederation Bridge in 1997 coupled with capacity improvements at Moncton and Halifax airports saw many changes to air traffic through Charlottetown.

===Charlottetown Airport Authority===
On February 28, 1999, the Department of Transport transferred operational and financial responsibility for the Charlottetown Airport to the Charlottetown Airport Authority under a 60-year lease arrangement, while the federal government remains the owner of the property.
Since the turn of the millennium, and especially since the mid-2000s, Charlottetown Airport has seen a considerable increase in the number of flights. The trend started when Air Canada introduced non-stop flights to Montreal-Trudeau Airport from Charlottetown after the acquisition of Canadian Airlines. JetsGo introduced non-stop flights from Charlottetown in early 2003. The flights didn&#x27;t last long, as JetsGo declared bankruptcy and shut down in March 2005.

In 2016 and 2017, the airport underwent major renovations to expand the size of the main terminal apron as well as a major expansion to runway 10/28 to have two 7,000-foot runways. Runway 10/28 reopened in late summer 2017. The renovations also included remodelling and added amenities within the terminal building, including a CBSA Customs Office.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport saw greatly diminished air carrier capacity. Only Air Canada Cargo was left operating at the airport in March and April of 2020. Limited passenger service returned with Air Canada in May 2020, and continued on its own until late 2021. In late 2021, Flair Airlines announced they would be operating a flight between Toronto and Charlottetown. Then, in May 2022, Swoop Airlines commenced operations between Toronto and Charlottetown, flying three times a week. In the summer of 2021, WestJet began to operate a direct flight between Charlottetown and Calgary. Porter Airlines began operating daily flights to Ottawa from Charlottetown in May 2023. In June 2023, WestJet started operating a direct flight between Charlottetown and Edmonton.

Airport traffic returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2022, breaking the airport’s passenger count records for October and November.

In 2022, the airport began a $20 million expansion to the main terminal building, planning to expand passenger seating as well as to create an outdoor seating area.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
===Historical passenger airline service: 1960s-2000s===

Eastern Provincial Airways served the airport during the 1960s with Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft and Handley Page Dart Herald turboprop aircraft. By 1970, Eastern Provincial had introduced jet service with Boeing 737-200 aircraft and was operating non-stop 737 flights to Halifax and Montreal as well as direct, no change of plane 737 service to Sydney, NS, Deer Lake, NL, Gander, NL and St. John&#x27;s, NL.

In 1975, Eastern Provincial Airlines was the only airline operating scheduled flights into the airport with non-stop Boeing 737-200 jet service from Halifax and Montreal as well as non-stop Handley Page Dart Herald turboprop service from Halifax, the Magdalen Islands and Moncton.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), a second airline was serving the airport by early 1976: Air Canada operating non-stop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service from Ottawa with these flights also providing one stop direct, no change of plane service from Toronto.
This same OAG also lists Eastern Provincial&#x27;s flights with Boeing 737-200 jet service being operated on the same routes with the airline also having replaced its Handley Page Dart Herald aircraft with Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops by this time.

Air Canada and Eastern Provincial were continuing to serve the airport during the early 1980s with Air Canada operating one daily nonstop to Ottawa with a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 with this flight continuing on to Toronto while Eastern Provincial was operating one daily nonstop flight to Montreal with a Boeing 737-200. However, by early 1985, Eastern Provincial, while continuing to serve the airport, was no longer operating nonstop flights to Montreal from Charlottetown. Eastern Provincial then merged with CP Air in 1986 to form Canadian Pacific Air Lines and successor Canadian Airlines was continuing to operate Boeing 737-200 jet service from the airport during the late 1980s.

In the late summer of 1994, three airlines were serving Charlottetown: Air Canada with one daily mainline DC-9-30 jet flight from Toronto which made an en route stop at Moncton, Air Nova operating code sharing service for Air Canada with six non-stop flights from Halifax operated every weekday flown with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprop aircraft and Air Atlantic operating code sharing service for Canadian Airlines with seven non-stop flights from Halifax every weekday also flown with Dash 8 aircraft. According to the OAG, Air Nova and Air Atlantic were also operating direct, no change of plane Dash 8 service into Charlottetown from Boston, Moncton and Saint John, NB with Air Nova operating direct Dash 8 flights from Fredericton, NB, Quebec City and Yarmouth, NS as well while Canadian Airlines was no longer operating mainline jet service into the airport at this time in 1994. By 1995, two airlines were operating non-stop service from the airport to Toronto with each air carrier operating one daily flight: Air Canada with Canadair CRJ regional jet service and Atlantic Island Airways with Fokker F28 Fellowship jet service. In 1999, Air Canada was operating its daily mainline non-stop flight to Toronto with a DC-9-30 jet while at the same time Royal Aviation was operating one non-stop flight a week to Toronto with a Boeing 757-200 jet.

During the summer of 2003, Jetsgo, a startup air carrier which flew Fokker 100 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, was operating three nonstop flights a week to Toronto and one nonstop flight a week to Montreal.

<text>A political argument is an instance of a logical argument applied to politics. Political arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office, and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment on and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.

The political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously fallacious.

A classic example of political arguments is those contained in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; arguing in favor of ratification of the American constitution.

There are several ways of classifying political argument:

* Based on the logical structure of the argument.
* Based on the purpose of the argument.
* Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.

== Purpose of political argument ==
The purpose of an argument is usually to sway belief. A political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot; can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda. One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact, some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that propaganda will take the place of argument. In a democracy, though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relationship between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power. In this case, political argument is an important element of political strategy. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda.

This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of social choice. Consider a social decision model of the kind used in the theory of social choice (such as used in stating Arrow&#x27;s theorem). In this model society has a set of individuals &quot;X&quot; and it faces a set of (political) alternatives &quot;A&quot; which need to be ranked in some way. A &quot;ranking&quot; is a relation &quot;R&quot; between the elements of &quot;A&quot; which is transitive and reflexive. Two alternatives &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; can satisfy &quot;a R b&quot; and &quot;b R a&quot;. If this is the case, we say &quot;R&quot; is indifferent to &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;. Each individual &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; will have an idiosyncratic ranking &quot;R&quot;&quot;x&quot; of the alternatives in &quot;A&quot;. A &quot;profile&quot; is any function &quot;P&quot; that associates with each individual &quot;x&quot; a ranking of alternatives &quot;P&quot;&quot;x&quot;; a profile is thus a function from &quot;X&quot; to rankings of &quot;A&quot;. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking &quot;R&quot;soc for the whole society from any profile &quot;P&quot;. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function &quot;P&quot; → &quot;R&quot;soc.

Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an &quot;effective&quot; political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. &quot;Effective&quot; political argument is a concept distinct from &quot;valid&quot; political argument.

=== Example ===
Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point &quot;T&quot;, that is individuals with income in excess of &quot;T&quot; pay taxes, and everyone else pays no taxes. In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate &quot;T&quot; can be determined: the median income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change an individual&#x27;s &quot;voting by their pocketbook&quot; by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, which is raising the tax cutoff point.

A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.

== Structure of political argument ==
Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion, etc. An argument cannot start from purely logical principles. An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions. The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of argument (which we can consider rules of fairness).

Semantically, some of the premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument are associated with specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable. For example, arguments concerning war must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war, and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve a commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

<text>Taipans are snakes of the genus Oxyuranus in the elapid family. They are large, fast-moving, highly venomous, and endemic to Australia and New Guinea. Three species are recognised, one of which, the coastal taipan, has two subspecies. Taipans are some of the deadliest known snakes.

==Taxonomy==
The common name, taipan, was coined by anthropologist Donald Thomson after the word used by the Wik-Mungkan Aboriginal people of central Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia. The Wik-Mungkan people used the name in reference to an ancestral creator being in Aboriginal Australian mythology known as the Rainbow Serpent.

The genus name is from Greek ὀξῠ́ς (&quot;oxys&quot;: sharp, needle-like) and οὐρανός (&quot;ouranos&quot;: an arch, specifically the vault of the heavens), and refers to the needle-like anterior process on the arch of the palate, which Kinghorn noted separated the genus from all other elapids. The oft-quoted meaning &quot;sharp-tailed&quot; (based on a confusion with οὐρά, &quot;oura&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;, and Latin &quot;anus&quot;) is both etymologically and morphologically incorrect.

The three known species are the coastal taipan (&quot;Oxyuranus scutellatus&quot;), the inland taipan (&quot;O. microlepidotus&quot;), and a recently discovered third species, the Central Ranges taipan (&quot;O. temporalis&quot;). The coastal taipan has two subspecies: the coastal taipan (&quot;O. s. scutellatus&quot;), found along the northeastern coast of Queensland, and the Papuan taipan (&quot;O. s. canni&quot;), found on the southern coast of New Guinea.

A 2016 genetic analysis showed that the speckled brown snake (&quot;Pseudonaja guttata&quot;) was an early offshoot of a lineage giving rise to the taipans, with the Central Ranges taipan being an offshoot of the common ancestor of the inland and coastal taipans.

===Species===
==Diet==
Their diet consists primarily of small mammals, especially rats and bandicoots.

==Venom==

Species of this genus possess highly neurotoxic venom with some other toxic constituents that have multiple effects on victims. The venom is known to paralyse the victim&#x27;s nervous system and clot the blood, which then blocks blood vessels and uses up clotting factors. Members of this genus are considered to be among the most venomous snakes in the world based on their murine , an indicator of the toxicity on mice. The inland taipan is considered to be the most venomous snake in the world and the coastal taipan, which is arguably the largest Australian venomous snake, is the third-most venomous snake in the world. The Central Ranges taipan has been less researched than other species of this genus, so the exact toxicity of its venom is still not clear, but it may be even more venomous than the other taipan species. Apart from venom toxicity, quantities of venom delivered should also be taken into account for the danger posed. The coastal taipan is capable of injecting a large quantity of venom due to its large size.

In 1950, Kevin Budden, an amateur herpetologist, was one of the first people to capture a taipan alive, although he was bitten in the process and died the next day. The snake, which ended up dying a few weeks later, was the first known taipan to have been milked for venom: Melbourne zoologist David Fleay and Dr. F. C. Morgan performed the milking, and the venom was used to develop an antivenom, which became available in 1955. The original preserved specimen is currently stored in the facilities of Museums Victoria.

Two antivenoms are available: CSL polyvalent antivenom and CSL taipan antivenom, both from CSL Limited in Australia.

In his book &quot;Venom&quot;, which explores the development of a taipan antivenom in Australia in the 1940s and 1950s, author Brendan James Murray states that only one person is known to have survived an &quot;Oxyuranus&quot; bite without antivenom: George Rosendale, a Guugu Yimithirr person bitten at Hope Vale in 1949. Murray writes that Rosendale&#x27;s condition was so severe that nurses later showed him extracted samples of his own blood that were completely black in colour.

Temperament also varies from species to species. The inland taipan is generally shy, while the coastal taipan can be quite aggressive when cornered and actively defends itself.

<text>In music, an accent is an emphasis, stress, or stronger attack placed on a particular note or set of notes, or chord, either because of its context or specifically indicated by an accent mark. Accents contribute to the articulation and prosody of a performance of a musical phrase. Accents may be written into a score or part by a composer, or added by the performer as part of their interpretation of a musical piece.

Compared to surrounding notes:
* A dynamic accent or stress accent is an emphasis using louder sound or stronger sound; typically, most pronounced on the attack of the sound.
* A tonic accent is an emphasis on notes by virtue of them being higher in pitch, as opposed to higher in volume.
* An agogic accent is an emphasis by virtue of notes being longer in duration.

Accents that don&#x27;t correspond to the stressed beats of the prevailing meter are said to be syncopated. For example, in common time, also called 4/4, the most common metre in popular music, the stressed beats are one and three. If accented chords or notes are played on beats two or four, that creates syncopation, since the music is emphasizing the &quot;weak&quot; beats of the bar. Syncopation is used in classical music, popular music, and traditional music. However, it is more prominent in blues, jazz, funk, disco, and Latin music.

==Agogic==
There are four kinds of agogic accents:
* Longer notated duration of a note, for example, a whole note/semibreve (four beats in common time) among quarter notes/crotchets (each of which gets one beat).
* Extended duration of a note within its full-time value (without altering the tempo). For example, players of organ and harpsichord (which do not allow the use of dynamic accents) can emphasize one of a sequence of &quot;staccato&quot; quarter notes by making it less &quot;staccato&quot; (that is, making one note longer to emphasize it).
* Extended duration of a note with the effect of temporarily slowing down the tempo (&quot;rubato&quot; or &quot;rallentando&quot;).
* Delayed onset of a note, for example by doing a pause before starting a note.

==Marks==
In music notation, an accent mark indicates a louder dynamic and a stronger attack to apply to a single note or an articulation mark. 
:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 5/4
 b-&gt; b-^ b-. b-! b--

&lt;/score&gt;

From left to right, the meanings of these articulation marks are explained below:

* The most common symbol is the horizontal wedge, the first symbol in the diagram above. This is the symbol that is most commonly referred to as &quot;accent mark&quot;. It indicates that the marked note should have an emphasized beginning and then taper off rather quickly. Though it is usually simply referred to as an accent. In jazz articulation, it is stated as &quot;dah&quot;.

* The vertical wedge, hat, or &quot;petit chapeau&quot;, shown second, signifies that a note should be played &quot;marcato&quot; (Italian for &quot;marked&quot;). It is generally accepted to be as loud as an accent mark and as short as a &quot;staccato&quot;. &quot;Martellato&quot;, Italian for &quot;hammered&quot;, also is denoted with the symbol, referring to a specific bowing technique used to create &quot;marcato&quot;. In jazz articulation, &quot;marcato&quot; is typically stated as &quot;daht&quot;, yet the performing musician may interpret the duration of the note differently depending on what style of jazz they are playing.

* The dot, shown third, signifies that a note should be played &quot;staccato&quot;. It indicates that the last part of a note should be silenced to create separation between it and the following note. For example, a written quarter note should be played as an eighth note followed by an eighth rest. The duration of a staccato note may be about half as long as the note value would indicate, although the tempo and performers&#x27; taste varies this quite a bit. In jazz articulation, it is stated as &quot;dit&quot;.

* The vertical stroke, (or sometimes an inverted wedge or inverted teardrop), shown fourth, is usually interpreted as &quot;staccatissimo&quot;, shorter than &quot;staccato&quot;. A &quot;staccatissimo&quot; crotchet (quarter note) would be correctly played in traditional art music as a lightly articulated semi-quaver (sixteenth note) followed by rests which fill the remainder of the beat. This mark was used by multiple composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Anton Bruckner, and Joseph Haydn, and the composers&#x27; intentions often varied at different points in their careers, and even at different points within a single work. The marking was generally used to indicate that the articulation was &quot;different&quot;. The marking was used to indicate various degrees of emphasis (ranging from accent to &quot;marcato&quot;), brevity (ranging from detached to &quot;staccato&quot; to hooked bowing), or some combination of the two. In the second half of the 19th century, German music (starting with Haydn&#x27;s later works) began replacing the vertical stroke with the regular accent mark when the notes were to be emphasized but not abbreviated, and French music began replacing the vertical stroke with the &quot;staccato&quot; dot when the notes were to be both emphasized and abbreviated. In 1954, a competition was held to write an essay on whether engravers should differentiate between vertical strokes and dots found in Mozart&#x27;s scores. Four of five of the essays published indicated a clear distinction in at least some passages. The same can be said of Bruckner&#x27;s use of these symbols. Because of the problems associated with reading music with this accent mark, the once commonplace marking has fallen nearly into disuse today.

* Finally, the &quot;tenuto&quot; mark, shown fifth above, generally means that a note or chord is to be played at full length. In jazz articulation, it is stated as &quot;doo&quot;.

Even when these symbols are absent, experienced musicians will introduce the appropriate gesture according to the style of the music. Mark McGrain writes about articulation on page 156 in his book &quot;Music Notation: Theory and Technique for Music Notation&quot;, where &quot;marcato&quot; accent in the third mark shown is referred to as the &quot;forzato&quot; accent, and the symbol as just an accent is referring to as the &quot;sforzando&quot; accent. &quot;Neither of these accents alter the durational value of the note or voicing they attend.&quot;

Another way to indicate accented notes (notes to emphasize or play louder compared to surrounding notes) is with &quot;sforzando&quot;, &quot;sforzato&quot;, &quot;forzando&quot; or &quot;forzato&quot; (abbreviated , , or ) (&quot;forcing&quot; or &quot;forced&quot;).

<text>José Julián Acosta (February 16, 1825 – August 26, 1891), was a journalist and an advocate of the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
José Julián Acosta Calbo was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Francisco de Acosta y Sandoval and Juana Antonia Calbo y Garriga. There he received his primary education. He was one of Rafael Cordero&#x27;s most notable students. Cordero was an inspiration to Acosta and the influence of his teachings remained with Acosta for the rest of his life. Later, he became a protégé of Father Rufo Manuel Fernández, who would send him to Madrid, Spain to study Physics and Mathematics. After he graduated in 1851, Acosta continued to expand his educational knowledge in Paris, London, and Berlin. In Berlin, he was a student of the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. When Acosta returned to Puerto Rico, he took a job as a professor of Botany and Maritime Sciences and became the director of the Civil Institute of Secondary Education. Acosta was the founder and editor of the newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot; (&quot;Progress&quot;), and he collaborated with many other newspapers which were oriented toward liberalism.

==Abolitionist==
Between 1865 and 1867, Acosta was a member of a Puerto Rican commission, which included Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Francisco Mariano Quiñones, and which participated in the &quot;Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar&quot; (Overseas Reforms Informative Board) which met in Madrid. Here, Acosta presented the argument for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. That same year, whilst in Madrid, Acosta was made a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of History, for his work in the editing of Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra&#x27;s &quot;Historia geografica, civil y natural de la isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico&quot;. (&quot;Geographic, Civil, and Natural History of the Island of St. John the Baptist of Puerto Rico&quot;)

Upon returning to the Island, Acosta, like many other Puerto Ricans with liberal views, was harshly mistreated by the Spanish governor. After the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt in 1868, he was suspected of being a conspirator and was imprisoned in the dungeons of Fort San Felipe del Morro by General Pavia, even though he had not participated in the failed revolt. Acosta later published a pamphlet entitled (&quot;Hours of Imprisonment&quot;) describing his experiences in prison.

==Political career==
Acosta became a member of the Liberal Reformist Party and in 1870, he founded the political newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot;. In 1871 he became an elected representative to the Spanish Courts. In 1873, he became president of the Liberal Reformist Party, but decided to leave the party in 1874, and joined the Autonomist Party formed by Román Baldorioty de Castro.

==Legacy==
On March 22, 1873, Acosta witnessed the success of his abolitionist efforts, with the proclamation of the decree for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. Acosta died on August 26, 1891, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was interred in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan. His great-grandson was Colonel Gilberto José Marxuach, the &quot;Father of the San Juan Civil Defense&quot;.

<text>3RRR (pronounced &quot;Three Triple R&quot;, or simply &quot;Triple R&quot;) is an Australian community radio station, based in Melbourne.

3RRR first commenced broadcasting in 1976 from the studios of 3ST, the student radio station of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (now RMIT University), on an educational licence with the name 3RMT. In 1979 it relocated to Fitzroy, and adopted its present name. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became synonymous with the post punk and new wave subcultures. In late 2004, supporters raised enough money for the station to purchase and move into new premises on the corner of Blyth and Nicholson Streets in Brunswick East after the 20-year lease on their previous studios, in Victoria Street, Fitzroy, expired.

3RRR&#x27;s mission statement was defined in 1990 as &quot;To educate, inform and entertain by drawing upon appropriate community resources. To develop a critical approach to contemporary culture.&quot; 
Triple R&#x27;s programming is split roughly 70% specialist music and 30% talk-based shows. Hosts have creative control over content and the station does not have playlists. As such, the nature of 3RRR broadcasts varies wildly depending on the time of the week. As 3RRR states, &quot;With the exception of [the] &quot;Breakfasters&quot;, all of Triple R’s programs are presented by volunteers&quot; who present their shows for no remuneration. A select few volunteer presenters are also in paid work at the station in operational roles.

3RRR&#x27;s operations are funded entirely by community sponsorships and public subscribers (currently around 15,000), which, by removing standard commercial pressures, allows for this diverse programming. The estimated current listenership is 440,000 per week. Due to the reaction from subscribers, in the late 1990s 3RRR cancelled sponsorship deals signed with the Ford and music venue The Mercury Lounge (due to its location in Melbourne&#x27;s Crown Casino). No such &quot;corporate&quot; sponsorship of this type has been considered since.

In 2009, 3RRR opened its performance space for live music, live comedy and literary events among others. In 2016, 3RRR was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

The station celebrated its 40th birthday in 2016 with a three month long collaborative exhibition ON AIR: 40 years of 3RRR at the State Library Victoria.

The name &quot;Local and/or General&quot; was borrowed from the name of a song and album by early 1980s band Models.In 1998 Richard Moffat left the show, and Natalie Mitchell hosted solo until 1999 when regular fill host Ryan Egan joined the show as co-host. Mitchell left the show in 2001 and Egan continued hosting solo until 2007 and handed over the reins to Jacinta Parsons, who hosted for a few years before moving on Dynamite and Detour shows. The show was then hosted by Nicole Jones and Luke Pocock for the next two years, with Pocock leaving in early 2011 to host his own show &#x27;Set it Out&#x27; on Tuesday drivetime and Jones hosting solo until April 2013.

<doc id="713935" wikidata="Q7593512" url="?curid=713935" title="St James railway station, Sydney">
<text>St James railway station is a heritage-listed underground commuter rail station that is located on the City Circle, at the northern end of Hyde Park in the Sydney central business district of New South Wales, Australia. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line, T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line and T8 Airport &amp; South Line services. It is named after the nearby St James&#x27; Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==


Part of the Bradfield Plan, St James railway station was originally intended to be a major interchange with the Eastern Suburbs line on Sydney&#x27;s underground rail system. Plans for the construction of St James included railway lines in four directions, but the original plan was never completed due to disagreements over the routes. Four platforms were completed, but the two inner platforms, intended to support Bradfield&#x27;s proposed eastern and western suburbs lines, were never put into service. When the Eastern Suburbs line was eventually built it was done so via a different route via Town Hall. In the 1990s, the two island platforms were connected by filling in the space between the two inner platforms, resulting in the single, large island platform seen today.

The station was designed by NSW Government Architect, George McRae, but not completed until after his death. It is an example of Inter-War Stripped Classical architecture influenced by Art Deco. One distinctive feature of the station is a neon sign from the late 1930s advertising Chateau Tanunda Brandy installed by Tucker, Lingard &amp; Co. It is located at the northern entrance on Elizabeth Street. It is a companion to Museum station, both opened at the same time and use a roundel design on their station signage that is similar to the one used on the London Underground.

St James station opened on 20 December 1926 with the opening of the eastern city line from Central. For the first 30 years, St James station was used as a terminating station for the East Hills and Illawarra lines. As a terminating station, St James was equipped with a small signal box and two dead end sidings, located in the tunnel stub at the north end of the station. The St James signal box, equipped with pistol grips, was the smallest such box in New South Wales. Trains arriving at St James would disembark passengers on one of the outer platforms, then the train would move to a siding and reverse direction, coming out at the opposite outer platform. During non-peak hours the driver would simply move to the other end of the train while the train was on the siding. During peak hours the train would take on a second driver in the last car while at the platform, then proceed to one of the sidings, where the drivers would exchange control of the train.

Completion of the City Circle loop did not occur until 30 years after St James station opened. Construction of the western city line as far as Wynyard was completed in 1932, but completion of the line connecting Wynyard and St James via Circular Quay, begun in 1936, proved problematic. Construction was halted during World War II and was intermittent after it resumed in 1945 due to inconsistent funding. The above-ground viaduct and Circular Quay railway station were finally completed in 1956, allowing trains to make a single circuit through the city and return to the suburbs without having to terminate.

As a result of this, St James&#x27;s terminating facilities were no longer regularly used. The signal box remained in use until 1990 with the occasional train continuing to terminate at St James to keep the siding tracks usable for emergencies and railway staff familiar with the procedures. In 1985–86, the signal box was taken out of service for an asbestos abatement project. During this period, train cars allocated for the removal of the asbestos would occupy one or the other of the dead end sidings, which meant that regular use of those lines by passenger trains was not possible. After the asbestos abatement project was completed, the signal box was returned to service until 1990, when asbestos was discovered in the signal box and the sidings. From that time the signal box was not used, and the signals and siding tracks were eventually removed. The sidings were formally closed on 27 July 1991.

In February 2010, a passenger lift between the platform and the concourse opened, followed later by a lift between the concourse and street level.

==Tunnels==
St James station is notable for the abandoned tunnels connected to the station. The Australian Railway Historical Society, with the approval of the State Rail Authority, has given tours of the tunnels, but many people have visited the tunnels by entering along the subway tracks. The tunnels were constructed as stubs for the planned eastern and western suburbs lines when the station was built in the 1920s. This was to ensure that the operation of St James would not be disrupted if future work was carried out on the lines. The abandoned tunnels extend some distance in either direction from St James. To the north is a double-track tunnel which proceeds for some 250 metres under Macquarie Street to be roughly parallel with the State Library; to the south two single-track tunnels extend to Whitlam Square at the intersection of Liverpool and College Streets.

===Use as a mushroom farm===
From 1933 to 1934, the City Inner tunnel between St James and Circular Quay was used by Raymond Mas as the location for an experimental mushroom farm producing of mushrooms per month.

===Use during World War II===
The southern tunnels were modified during World War II to serve as a public air raid shelter. The abandoned air raid shelter begins in the single track section of the southern end of the station and continues into the two single track tunnels beyond. At the station end the air raid shelter is protected by a blast curtain and the doorways and openings for ventilation between the chambers, each about 30 metres long, are protected by blast curtains.

The tunnels were also used during World War II as an operations bunker by the No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF. The bunker was located in what was intended to be the City Inner Tunnel, access to which was provided by a wooden staircase in a shaft leading upward to Shakespeare Place. Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) personnel housed in this operations bunker collected information from radar and weather stations, as well as reports on air traffic, ship and troop movements collected from airports, army and Volunteer Air Observer Corps reporting posts. This section of tunnel was constructed using a cut and cover technique outside St James station, and connects to the tunnels in St James through pilot tunnels, accessible via ladder.

As air quality in the tunnel was poor, WAAAF shifts were limited to six hours. Eventually the health of the WAAAF personnel declined due to poor air quality or poor food, so operations were relocated first to The Capital Theatre in Bankstown, and subsequently to the Bankstown Bunker on Black Charlies Hill near Condell Park.

The staircase used to access the bunker was destroyed by fire on 16 November 1968. Smoke from this fire interrupted train service for approximately twelve hours.

===Underground lake===
The end of the northern tunnel flooded and produced an underground lake, wide, deep, and long. Known as St James Lake, it is off limits to the public. In recent years, due to drought and diminishing water supplies in underground aquifers, there have been a number of proposals for how to use the abandoned tunnels and other underground spaces for storage and recycling of water.

In the mid-2000s, Ian Kiernan proposed that an abandoned water tunnel, Busby&#x27;s Bore, be redirected to St James Lake where water could be stored and recycled. Busby&#x27;s Bore was originally used to carry water from nearby swamps to the Hyde Park area, but was abandoned for that purpose in the 1890s after becoming contaminated by sewage. In 2004 the idea of recycling the water from the bore received support from the executive director of the Botanical Gardens Trust, Tim Entwisle.

During 2006, it was proposed that the northern unused tunnels be used as a reservoir for irrigation water for The Domain and the Royal Botanic Gardens as part of a Clean Up Australia project to create a series of water reclamation and storage facilities. Clean Up Australia partnered with a number of groups in the attempt to move the project forward, and in 2007 obtained funding to proceed. Also in 2007, State Premier Morris Iemma announced plans to harvest rainwater at Parliament House. According to this plan all storm water from Parliament House, the State Library and Sydney Hospital (all on Macquarie Street) would be drained into the tunnels, treated, and then pumped back to storage tanks at the surface for use in non-potable water systems, saving an estimated each year.

In January 2008, the Minister for Transport John Watkins said he intended to ask RailCorp to begin a study to determine if the underground network of tunnels could be used for water storage. The project began on 15 January 2008 when water tanks for storage of the recycled water were installed on the top of Parliament House.
===In popular culture===
The tunnels which had been prepared as an air raid shelter were also used by ABC TV as a location for one episode of the TV series &quot;Police Rescue&quot; in the early 1990s. In the episode, a boy who had fallen down a storm drain is rescued.

There is also a large bell in one of the tunnels. According to one source, the ABC used this bell to simulate the sound of Big Ben for use in a TV series during the 1960s, but that information has not been verified. Another source suggests that the bell was installed by Nigel Helyer in 1992 as a work of art. The piece, titled &quot;An UnRequited Place&quot;, was part of the Working in Public project created by ArtSpace Sydney, and was a combination of the physical sculpture, performance and audio broadcast. For 21 days the sound of the bell tolling at midnight was broadcast by the ABC.

The platforms were used as a shooting location in 2003 film &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;.

In 2008, the station was used as a location for the mini-series &quot;False Witness&quot;. The platforms featured in Zoë Badwi&#x27;s 2010 music video &quot;Freefallin&quot;. In 2011, &quot;The Tunnel&quot; was filmed in the abandoned tunnels.

===2018 proposal===
In September 2018, expressions of interest were being sought to use the tunnels as the next underground attraction in Sydney.

==Platforms and services==
== Heritage listing ==
St James station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station is of State significance because, along with Museum, it was the first underground station in Australia and demonstrates the adaptation of the London tube-style station to the Australian situation. The station is well constructed, proportioned and detailed.
The station complex is an important part of the larger Sydney Harbour Bridge and the electrified City Underground Railway scheme and has associations with prominent persons such as JJC Bradfield, chief engineer and designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and city underground and organisations such as the Department of Railways and represents the culmination of many years of political lobbying for a city railway system. The construction of the city underground and position of St James station encouraged the retail and commercial development of the Sydney CBD in the late 1920s and 1930s, with large department stores constructed around the stations.

The station head house building is a fine and largely intact example of a small-scale Inter-War Stripped Classical style building which adds to the general character of the immediate area. It has significance as one of two buildings of its type and style remaining in the city railway system (the other being Museum Station entrance) and is a rare example of this type of station building.

The underground platforms and concourse retain many original features and provide one of the most ornate station interiors in the NSW railway system. Disused platforms demonstrate the grand plans of the 1930s railway network of Bradfield, while the air raid shelter areas in the southern tunnels are rare surviving elements of Sydney&#x27;s World War II defences.

Individual elements, such as the tiling, ornate stairs, lights and clocks add to the ambience of the station, while the Chateau Tanunda neon advertising sign at the Elizabeth Street entrance is a rare surviving example of a 1930s neon sign in Sydney.

<text>Wanda Wasilewska (), also known by her Russian name Vanda Lvovna Vasilevskaya () (21 January 1905 – 29 July 1964), was a Polish and Soviet novelist and journalist and a left-wing political activist. 

She was a socialist who became a devoted communist. She fled the German attack on Warsaw in September 1939 and took up residence in Soviet-occupied Lviv and eventually in the Soviet Union. 

She was a founding member of the Union of Polish Patriots and played an important role in the creation of the 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division. The division developed into the Polish People&#x27;s Army and fought on the Eastern Front during World War II. 

Wasilewska was a trusted consultant to Joseph Stalin, and her influence was essential to the establishment of the Polish Committee of National Liberation in July 1944 and to the formation of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

== Biography ==

=== Before World War II ===

Wasilewska was born, the second of three daughters, on 25 January 1905 in Kraków, Austrian Poland. Her father was Leon Wasilewski, a Polish Socialist Party (PPS) politician and first foreign minister of the newly re-emerging independent Poland. Her mother, Wanda Zieleniewska, was also a PPS member and the young Wasilewska had gotten to know the party leaders at home. From 1923, she studied Polish language and Polish literature at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, where several years later she acquired her doctorate. While studying, she became involved with the Union of Independent Socialist Youth (ZNMS, allied with the PPS) and the Society of Workers&#x27; Universities. From the early 1930s, Wasilewska was strongly involved in women&#x27;s issues and gender equality. Her attitude was exemplified by her own personal conduct as well as her work in the Women&#x27;s Section of the PPS. However, she eventually chose to emphasize in her activism the broader class issues, remarked that it was easier to deal with men and criticized Warsaw feminists for coloring their movement with &quot;feminism of half a century ago&quot;.

Wasilewska joined the PPS as a student. She was a member of the main party council in 1934–37. She served there with her father, whose connections turned out helpful at the various stages and vicissitudes of her career in Poland. Wasilewska later wrote of her student PPS years: &quot;We had a lot of trouble with the communists because they were adamant about carrying out actions that could lead to bloodshed and we thought that was something that should not be done. Rather, we were into innocent skirmishes with the police ... &quot;. Her radicalism grew gradually from the early 1930s and she began viewing the socialists as former revolutionaries turned conformists, compromised by collaboration with state authorities. Writing to her mother in November 1931, Wasilewska characterized herself as &quot;turning increasingly Bolshevik&quot;, and in the spring of 1932, she joined a radical youth faction that pushed for confrontation with the Sanation regime and advocated joint action with the communists within the newly established Popular Front alliance. At that time she wrote to her mother of the &quot;desperation of the people&quot; and concluded: &quot;the communists will do something or we will, or we together with the communists&quot;. As Wasilewska drew closer to the communists, her relations with the PPS deteriorated and she lost her seat in the party council, but never left the organization.

Having finished her studies, Wasilewska started working as a secondary school teacher in Kraków, but lost her job when the school authorities refused to extend her contract because of her leftist views. With her husband Marian Bogatko, also dismissed from work as a strike organizer, in autumn 1934, they moved to Warsaw, where Wasilewska became involved with the Polish section of the International Red Aid, an organization concerned with helping political prisoners and their families, and the Polish League for the Defense of Human and Citizens&#x27; Rights. Wasilewska found employment in the Editorial Division of the Polish Teachers&#x27; Union. She met there and befriended Janina Broniewska, the wife of revolutionary poet Władysław Broniewski; Janina&#x27;s radical views would significantly influence Wasilewska. Wasilewska was a journalist for various left-wing newspapers, among them &quot;Naprzód&quot;, &quot;Robotnik&quot;, &quot;Dziennik Popularny&quot;, &quot;Oblicze Dnia&quot; and &quot;Lewar&quot;, and the chairperson of the &quot;Płomyk&quot; and &quot;Płomyczek&quot; monthlies for children. &quot;Płomyk&quot; was published under the auspices of the Teachers&#x27; Union and its March 1936 issue, Wasilewska devoted entirely to the promotion of communist models of upbringing as practised in the Soviet Union. In the aftermath, she was attacked in the Polish parliament by Prime Minister Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski, the printing ended up confiscated by the authorities, government restrictions and oversight were imposed on the activities of the Teachers&#x27; Union, and Wasilewska lost her job at the Editorial Division. Following this she was offered employment as the editor of the short lived &quot;Gazetka Miki&quot; for which, due to her notoriety, she wrote under the pen name Wanda Woskowska. Wasilewska was often criticised for her radical left-wing views and supported an alliance of all the left-wing parties, including the communists, against the ruling Sanation. Wasilewska was closely associated with the communists from the mid-1930s. In May 1936 Wasilewska, among other left-wing Polish and Western Ukrainian writers, participated in the Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers. The gathering of intellectuals and cultural activists passed a resolution declaring their support for international humanist values and opposition to fascism, nationalism, capitalism, imperialism and war; it did not invoke a Soviet leadership. Wasilewska left the congress convinced that &quot;today the place of the writer, of the artist is among the proletariat of towns and villages, fighting for its liberation&quot;. Among the labour actions actively supported by Wasilewska was the 1937 strike of the Polish Teachers&#x27; Union, coordinated by her together with Janina Broniewska.

In Poland Wasilewska, despite her own established position, was known as &quot;Leon&#x27;s daughter&quot;. Leon Wasilewski died in December 1936. Wasilewska recounted her comrades and communists bringing to his funeral a wreath with an inscription that read: &quot;For Wanda&#x27;s father&quot;. It is not clear what Wasilewska&#x27;s position was on Stalin&#x27;s persecution and extermination of Polish communists and the 1938 dissolution of the Communist Party of Poland ordered by the Comintern (she seems to have justified a &quot;necessity&quot; of &quot;certain actions&quot;, given the pressure and isolation that the Soviet state was subjected to), but on the eve of World War II she was a firm supporter of the Soviet Union, which she saw as the only force capable of stopping fascism. Wasilewska was highly regarded and accomplished in the field of social work. Helping the needy, especially children, was her natural inclination and passion. Early in the period of her studies Wasilewska met Roman Szymański, a mathematics student and popular PPS activist. They married and had a daughter Ewa. Szymański, however, died of typhus in August 1931. Later the same year Wasilewska met Marian Bogatko, a construction worker active in the PPS. Their successful relationship, purposely not sanctioned by traditional marriage, became a formal marriage in late 1936, when Wasilewska and Bogatko needed documents to travel to the Soviet Union. Bogatko was murdered by Soviet agents in May 1940 in Lviv. At that time Wasilewska was already a delegate to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. There are different versions of what had happened or who was the actual target. Nikita Khrushchev later wrote: &quot;Wasilewska believed that it was not the case of premeditation and continued active work&quot;; according to him, Bogatko was killed by mistake.

=== During World War II ===

After the Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Wasilewska, like hundreds of thousands of other Poles, fled to the east and following Stalin&#x27;s directions ended up in Lviv (after the Soviet invasion of Poland a part of the Soviet-occupied zone). Like other Polish citizens, she soon automatically became a Soviet citizen, but unlike many she was enthusiastic about the historic turn of events and Poland&#x27;s prospects under the Soviet tutelage that she expected; she thought it would promote both the national and social liberation of Poles. Wasilewska officially joined as a member the (All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) already in September 1939. According to Khrushchev, the Soviets worked with Wasilewska on organizing the Polish intelligentsia members present in their zone and turning them into Soviet allies. Several dozen Polish literary figures indeed joined the Federation of Soviet Writers of Ukraine in the fall of 1940. Wasilewska prevented a complete Ukrainization of the University of Lviv: because of her intervention part of the Polish prewar faculty remained there and teaching in Polish was retained in some departments. Also in 1940, Wanda Wasilewska participated in the production of &quot;Wind from the East&quot; – a propaganda film which justified the Soviet Invasion of Poland. Wasilewska soon came into prominence as a Soviet loyalist and diplomatic arrangements were made to bring members of her immediate family and her associates from Warsaw to Lviv. Five Poles were exchanged for five Germans in a transaction that took place at what was then the Soviet-German border. Wasilewska&#x27;s daughter Ewa moved to the Soviet zone, but Wanda&#x27;s mother and Bogatko&#x27;s brother refused to move there.

She was involved with various communist organisations uniting local Polish and Ukrainian communists. She was a journalist for &quot;Czerwony Sztandar&quot; (&#x27;The Red Banner&#x27;), a pro-Soviet newspaper printed in Lviv in Polish from October 1939. &quot;Czerwony Sztandar&quot; published a declaration signed by Polish writers, including Wasilewska, welcoming the &quot;unification of Ukraine&quot;, meaning the incorporation of the southern part of Kresy into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In early 1940 Joseph Stalin, who favored Wasilewska among the Polish communists, awarded her a seat in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. She became literary director of the Polish Theatre in Lviv, replacing Broniewski, who was arrested by the NKVD. Wasilewska was also one of the founders, together with Jerzy Putrament, of the social-literary monthly &quot;Nowe Widnokręgi&quot; (&#x27;New Horizons&#x27;), published from March 1941 and revived in May 1942 with Alfred Lampe.

On 28 June 1940, Stalin received Wasilewska, an unofficial leader of Polish communists, at the Moscow Kremlin. The event initiated a reorientation of Soviet policies in regard to Poles, which was reported with concern by the German embassy in Moscow. As a result, a wide range of official political, military, social, cultural, educational and other Soviet-Polish projects and activities commenced in 1940 and continued during the years that followed.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Wasilewska fled before the advancing Nazi army and in June 1941 arrived in Moscow. She joined the Red Army as a war correspondent and functionary of the Political Commandment, with the military rank of colonel. To agitate for the cause of the Great Patriotic War, she tirelessly traversed the many paths of the Soviet-German front, &quot;everywhere impatiently awaited&quot; by the soldiers. Wasilewska soon wrote the war novel &quot;Tęcza&quot; (&#x27;The Rainbow&#x27;), instantly translated into Russian. The novel earned her the Stalin Prize and based on it a film was made. In August 1941 she became chairman of the Polish section of the All-Slavic Anti-Fascist Committee.

According to Jakub Berman, the relationship between Stalin and Wasilewska became one of familiarity; she was free to contact him personally and had his private telephone number. Stalin made no secret of his confidence in Wasilewska, while she displayed considerable moral courage in her handling of the relationship.

Following a January 1943 letter written with Lampe to Vyacheslav Molotov and consultations with Stalin, Wasilewska became the head of the Union of Polish Patriots (&quot;Związek Patriotów Polskich&quot;, ZPP), a mass-membership political and social organization for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union, officially formed at its founding congress in Moscow in June 1943. The ZPP, where Wasilewska functioned as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s great trustee&quot;, was oriented toward the establishment of socialism in Poland; it facilitated the development of Poland&#x27;s post-war government. Wasilewska was very involved in organizing material help for Poles dispersed in many parts of the Soviet Union and Polish schools for children. Nearly thirty thousand Polish children in the Soviet Union, many of them orphans, were taken care of by Wasilewska and her ZPP colleagues; most were returned to Poland after the war.

After the Soviets suspended relations with the Polish government-in-exile in late April 1943 (following the revelations of the Katyn massacre), Wasilewska wrote an article in &quot;Izvestia&quot; sharply critical of the Polish government, which was taken as a sign that no Soviet-Polish government &quot;rapprochement&quot; was in the offing. On 6 May 1943, in Wasilewska-edited &quot;Wolna Polska&quot; (&#x27;The Free Poland&#x27;) periodical, the formation of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division was announced. Wasilewska and Zygmunt Berling had appealed to Stalin for permission to create a Polish division already in September 1942. Now they accomplished their goal and Stalin&#x27;s move signaled his definite intention to pursue Poland-related undertakings without regard to the government of Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski.

On 15 July 1943, the newly trained and equipped Polish army was shown to the public and the audience included foreign war correspondents. After the parade a press conference was given by Berling and Wasilewska, who spoke on behalf of the ZPP. In October, the Polish army fought the Germans for the first time in the Battle of Lenino. According to Wasilewska, she herself pressed for early deployment of the force. There was a perception of the need to demonstrate, before the Tehran Conference of the Allies, that the Soviet-allied Polish army was already engaged in combat, ahead of the army of Władysław Anders, which had left the Soviet Union. At Lenino the Poles suffered heavy, but not unusual for the Soviet front casualties. Nevertheless, Wasilewska was appalled by the losses and had the division withdrawn from combat for further training and expansion, until the middle of 1944. Following the battle, the ZPP took it upon itself to award official military medals of the Polish state, such as the Virtuti Militari and the Cross of Valour.
In July 1944, Wasilewska became deputy chief of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a provisional government sponsored by the Soviet Union and established in Lublin, in opposition to the Polish government-in-exile in London. On 6–7 August, together with Bolesław Bierut and Michał Rola-Żymierski, Wasilewska conducted in Moscow unsuccessful negotiations with Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk of the government-in-exile (he refused their offer of becoming prime minister of a communist-dominated government).

Already in 1942, Wasilewska presented to Ksawery Pruszyński the concept of &quot;Poland of Bolesław Krzywousty&quot;, from the Oder to the Bug River. Geographical vision of post-war Poland, deprived of the &quot;Kresy&quot; eastern lands but compensated with the so-called Recovered Territories in the west, was formed in Wasilewska&#x27;s discussions with Stalin. Back then, the Russian communists demanded reduction of a potentially hostile future Polish state to lands where ethnic Poles formed a majority of inhabitants. In July 1944, Wasilewska additionally secured Stalin&#x27;s consent for the moving of Poland&#x27;s western border in its southern portion from Nysa Kłodzka to Nysa Łużycka. It later caused problems at the Potsdam Conference, because the British wanted to preserve this part of Lower Silesia for the future German state.

Wasilewska explained away Stalin&#x27;s deadly purges by arguing that death of an innocent person was preferable to the risk of demise of the Soviet Union. The persecutions and victims, she felt, were an unavoidable cost of future progress or resulted from licentious conduct by functionaries. She intervened when Poles whom she knew were deported to distant regions of the Soviet Union and engaged in relief activities, such as sending parcels to deportees. Wasilewska&#x27;s interventions freed her fellow Polish communists (kept in detention by Lavrentiy Beria even after the official amnesty for Poles negotiated by the government of Władysław Sikorski), the poet Broniewski and his by then estranged wife Janina Broniewska. Broniewska, who went to Moscow and worked for &quot;Nowe Widnokręgi&quot;, took care of Wasilewska&#x27;s daughter Ewa during Wasilewska&#x27;s lengthy involvement at the German front. When the Polish People&#x27;s Army was formed, Wasilewska and Broniewska pushed for the use as an emblem on soldier uniforms and elsewhere of a crownless Piast eagle taken from the restored sarcophagus of Bolesław III Wrymouth, a medieval ruler of Poland. The crownless eagle, contrary to the previously and historically used eagle with a crown, was accepted for the army and remained in exclusive use as the coat of arms of Poland throughout the period of existence of communist Poland (1945–89).

Stalin valued Wasilewska&#x27;s opinion highly, even though (or in part because) she had no prewar background in the Communist Party of Poland. As she later wrote, during the war all the matters were settled through her to the detriment of input from other Polish communists, even though she had not sought a leadership role but rather took advantage of the opportunities as they arose.

=== After World War II ===

After the war, Wasilewska decided to stay in the Soviet Union and retired from public life, thus rejecting the opportunity for becoming an active member of the political elites in communist Poland. She was involved in a long-term relationship with Ukrainian playwright and Soviet state official Oleksandr Korniychuk, with whom she moved to Kyiv. Wasilewska had limited Russian and Ukrainian language abilities, but was a member of the Supreme Soviet for six terms. She often visited Poland, where a room was kept for her use at the villa of Broniewska in Warsaw. She was highly influential in the affairs of Poland and consulted by the country&#x27;s top leaders, including Bierut and Berman. Especially before Gomułka&#x27;s ascent to power in 1956, Wasilewska&#x27;s visits followed invitations from the authorities; afterwards they were less frequent and of a more private character. According to communist historian Andrzej Werblan, Wasilewska and Gomułka were politically incompatible. She made frequent foreign trips as an activist in the peace movement, including one to Stockholm in 1956.

Wasilewska wrote to her friend Nikita Khrushchev to complain of the 1955 publication of &quot;Poemat dla dorosłych&quot; (&#x27;A Poem for Adults&#x27;) by Adam Ważyk, which she saw as one of the manifestations of the increasingly present in Poland anti-socialist agitation. However, after Khrushchev&#x27;s assumption of the Soviet leadership and his reforms, she seemed primarily preoccupied with her family affairs and by the tending her grandson Peter in particular. She was often visited by family members and friends from Poland. Among other guests Wasilewska and Korniychuk entertained was the writer John Steinbeck. She spent time with her husband in their dacha not far from Kyiv, but the relationship eventually deteriorated. She developed heart and circulatory problems.

Wanda Wasilewska died on 29 July 1964 in Kyiv and is buried in the Baikove Cemetery. Oleksandr Korniychuk, who outlived her by several years, was buried there in another grave.

== Role, assessments, influence and works ==

Wasilewska has &quot;her place in Polish collective memory as a symbol of the establishment of the communist order after World War II&quot;.

Brought up in a patriotic, intellectual, left-wing but anti-Russian Polish establishment environment, Wanda Wasilewska gradually developed a communist identity and revolutionary outlook, to become a theorist, ideologue and promoter of communism in Poland. She was &quot;strongly embedded in the historical and geopolitical context of her era&quot; and blurred in her daily activities and works she produced the distinction between the public or political, and private aspects of her life. The transgressions she engaged in as a radical leftist were of many dimensions and involved transcending the borders of her gender, nationality, and social class (it amounted to &quot;rejecting superstition&quot;, as she put it).

Wasilewska writings were heavily socially and ideologically engaged. She accused Sanation Poland of gross discrimination of its citizens based on their rank (the elites vs. the masses) and ethnicity. She pointed to a combination of economic and nationalistic oppression of the working classes and the minorities by the industry and land owners and by people of the dominant Polish language and culture.

With the end of the war, Wasilewska removed herself from the position of power to assume other roles. As Władysław Gomułka saw it, later she must have had regretted the decision she made but had to live with it. She &quot;played her role till the end&quot;, but in a letter to her mother complained about the many ailments she suffered from, ascribing them all to &quot;nerves&quot;. Agnieszka Mrozik speculates that Wasilewska&#x27;s diseased body expressed her reaction to &quot;the corset of a monument which she was given to wear&quot; and that she may have been &quot;stuck&quot; in a role which &quot;involved – apart from the appearance of a fulfilled activist and writer – the appearance of a happy woman&quot;.

To some degree, Wasilewska might have been pushed out or discouraged from continuing political career in postwar Poland, because of being a lone woman in the Polish communist leadership or because of her image causing a problem for the new authorities (considered too closely associated with Stalin).

Depending on the political orientation of those who judged her and the propaganda needs of the moment, Wasilewska has been depicted in different, often extreme ways. She was a revolutionary icon of the new order and an embodiment of progress under Stalinism. Afterwards, in Gomułka years, the stress was on her military and social activities as she became a patriotic symbol in the national Romantic tradition. For those strongly opposed to communism, radical leftism or the Soviet domination of Poland, she has been a &quot;monstrosity&quot; and represented &quot;pathology&quot; and &quot;betrayal&quot;; labels such as &quot;renegade&quot;, &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;collaborator&quot; have commonly been used. In particular, her gender has been referenced to deny her as a woman individual agency and define her position relative to men, as in the primary characterizations of &quot;Stalin&#x27;s favorite&quot; or &quot;Leon&#x27;s disgraced daughter&quot;. Adam Ciołkosz, Wasilewska&#x27;s colleague and friend in her PPS years and an anti-communist émigré in post-war London, wrote &quot;biographical sketches&quot; about her. He patronizingly described Wasilewska as a well-meaning, even if sometimes rebellious (yet lacking truly radical credentials) woman of proper upbringing but limited intellectual ability and emotional maturity, who at the time of the Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939) succumbed to a sudden onset of infatuation with the Soviet Union. Wasilewska&#x27;s biography, according to Mrozik, has been &quot;continuously rewritten and corrected&quot; by those who wanted to &quot;inscribe into her their own content&quot;. This makes it possible to see her as a &quot;liminal character&quot;, used to mark &quot;the boundaries of political periods and ideological attitudes&quot;. The great Pole, an outstanding writer and diplomat from her pre-1989 biographies became a &quot;degenerate daughter of the Polish nation&quot; afterwards. Such processing of Wasilewska narrative corresponded with the dominant at a given place and time historical narrative (of pre-1989 Poland, post-1989 Poland, or Polish &quot;émigré&quot; circles in the West after World War II).

Wasilewska was one of the first Polish writers to follow the rules of socialist realism. She wrote several novels and a handful of poems. &quot;Oblicze Dnia&quot; (&#x27;The Face of Day&#x27;) novel had the printing of its book edition stopped by Sanation censorship (it had already been issued in installments in the leftist &quot;Naprzód&quot; periodical). After an intervention by Wasilewska&#x27;s father, the book was published in an expurgated form. However, a Russian translation and edition were soon produced. Around 1936, on several occasions the Soviet Embassy paid Wasilewska compensation for her books published in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, where Wasilewska&#x27;s literary works were much more appreciated than in Poland, the material she produced, including elements of her personal story, were turned, in accordance with the convention of socialist realism, into a model to be followed by the population.

In the early 1950s, Wasilewska and Korniychuk wrote a libretto for Kostiantyn Dankevych&#x27;s opera &quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;. After it became a target of ideologically based criticism, the authors submitted self-criticism and revised their work.

Wasilewska was a triple recipient of the Stalin Prize for literature (1943, 1946, 1952). During Stalin&#x27;s lifetime she was considered a classic writer of Soviet literature and her works were included in the Soviet school curriculum. Her &quot;collected works&quot; were published in Moscow in six volumes in 1955. The first volume was translated into the Ukrainian language and published in Ukraine in 1966. However, after the death of Stalin, Wasilewska was largely forgotten as a writer.

The communist government in Poland named countless streets and schools after her and she was one of the most notable figures in communist society. After the war, some of her books were obligatory school reading.

<text>In geometry, any hyperplane &quot;H&quot; of a projective space &quot;P&quot; may be taken as a hyperplane at infinity. Then the set complement is called an affine space. For instance, if are homogeneous coordinates for &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space, then the equation defines a hyperplane at infinity for the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional affine space with coordinates . &quot;H&quot; is also called the ideal hyperplane.

Similarly, starting from an affine space &quot;A&quot;, every class of parallel lines can be associated with a point at infinity. The union over all classes of parallels constitute the points of the hyperplane at infinity. Adjoining the points of this hyperplane (called ideal points) to &quot;A&quot; converts it into an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space, such as the real projective space .

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space &quot;A&quot; is completed to a projective space &quot;P&quot;, which may be called the projective completion of &quot;A&quot;. Each affine subspace &quot;S&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is completed to a projective subspace of &quot;P&quot; by adding to &quot;S&quot; all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in &quot;S&quot;. The resulting projective subspaces are often called &quot;affine subspaces&quot; of the projective space &quot;P&quot;, as opposed to the infinite or ideal subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).

In the projective space, each projective subspace of dimension &quot;k&quot; intersects the ideal hyperplane in a projective subspace &quot;at infinity&quot; whose dimension is .

A pair of non-parallel affine hyperplanes intersect at an affine subspace of dimension , but a parallel pair of affine hyperplanes intersect at a projective subspace of the ideal hyperplane (the intersection &quot;lies on&quot; the ideal hyperplane). Thus, parallel hyperplanes, which did not meet in the affine space, intersect in the projective completion due to the addition of the hyperplane at infinity.

<text>Baltimore City College, known colloquially as City, City College, and B.C.C., is a college preparatory school with a liberal arts focus and selective admissions criteria located in Baltimore, Maryland. Opened in October 1839, B.C.C. is the third-oldest active public high school in the United States. City College is a public exam school and an International Baccalaureate World School at which students in the ninth and tenth grades participate in the IB Middle Years Programme while students in the eleventh and twelfth grades participate in the IB Diploma Programme.

The school is situated on a hilltop campus located in the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello neighborhood in Northeast Baltimore. The main campus building, a designated National Historic Landmark, is constructed of granite and limestone in a Collegiate Gothic architectural style and features a Gothic tower.

==History==


In response to increasing public pressure due to the changing needs of Baltimore&#x27;s trade and commercial classes, political leaders introduced legislation authorizing establishing a high school. After a long spirited public controversy and debate over the values of higher public education beyond the grammar (elementary) school level / modern eighth grade. The resolution establishing the new school was finally unanimously passed by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839, and was signed into law by then Mayor Shepard C. Leakin. &quot;The High School&quot; opened with 46 pupils under the direction of Professor Nathan C. Brooks,(1809–1898), a locally noted classical educator and poet, who also served as the first principal, the first head of school of a new type of higher institution in Baltimore&#x27;s developing public education system since its establishment in 1829, a decade before. &quot;The High School&quot; opened on October 20, 1839, and was initially housed in a rented building on Courtland Street (present-day Saint Paul Street/Place) &quot;under the direction of Professor Nathan C. Brooks (1809–1898), a locally renowned Classics scholar. The school was housed at three different locations in its first three years of existence before returning to its original building on Courtland Street. The City Council in 1843 allocated $23,000 () to acquire the nearby Assembly Rooms building at the northeast corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets for the new school. The City Council in 1850 granted the Board of School Commissioners the right to confer graduates of the then-decade old high school with certificates of graduation, and the following year of 1851 in the old famous Front Street Theatre, along the east bank of the Jones Falls stream (between East Fayette and Lexington Streets) in the colonial era Jonestown / Old Town neighborhoods east of downtown, the school held its first commencement ceremony under the name of the &quot;Central High School of Baltimore&quot; (replacing the former unofficial title of the Male High School 
– used following the 1844 founding of twin all-female secondary schools of the Eastern and Western Female High Schools sited in opposite sides of the city). The reorganized Central High had its first ceremonies with well-known influential civic citizen, orator and lawyer Severn Teackle Wallis (1816–1894), as its first commencement speaker.

In the wake of an 1865 recommendation from the Baltimore City Council, the Board of School Commissioners, renamed and elevated the Central High School of Baltimore to become The Baltimore City College and allowed it to began offering a five-year academic track, in an effort to elevate the school to the status of a baccalaureate degree-conferring college. On October 9, 1866, the City Council accepted the School Board request and renamed the high school officially as &quot;The Baltimore City College&quot;. The Council however failed to take any further action such as recommendations to the General Assembly of Maryland. Therefore, the new B.C.C. with its longer curriculum and stricter academic standards was never granted the power during the later 1800s to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees, although for the following generations / decades, a Baltimore City College elaborate inscribed diploma frequently gave a graduate to be given advanced credit status in many American colleges and universities, such as the longtime special relationship between B.C.C and its adjacent neighbors at The Johns Hopkins University.

In November 1873, a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theater next door to the north to the historic &quot;Assembly Rooms&quot; structure forcing the City Council to allocate new resources to build a new school building especially for the recently renamed Baltimore City College. The council acquired a lot several blocks further northwest on the southwest corner of North Howard Street opposite West Centre Street and allocated $150,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the construction of the new building designed by Baltimore architect Edmund G. Lind and municipal architect George A. Frederick, who also designed the then-new monumental Baltimore City Hall under construction 1867–1875.

The new City College building was constructed in an English Gothic revival style of brown brick. The new high school was also adjacent to the Academy of Music auditorium and theater recently also completed and opened that same year, in the center of Baltimore&#x27;s new theater / entertainment district. 
The new City College&#x27;s third major academic structure was dedicated on February 1, 1875. The high school remained in its new building for 17 years when it was undermined in August 1892 by the underground construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Howard Street tunnel causing the B.C.C. structure to collapse. B.C.C. held classes further northwest in a converted school at Dolphin Street and Pennsylvania Avenue and also at northeast corner of North Paca and West Fayette Streets in another former elementary school building.

By the end of the decade, a new larger structure designed in the Italianate Romanesque Revival style of architecture of red brick with gray stone trim by the noted local architectural firm of Baldwin &amp; Pennington (Ephraim Baldwin and Josias Pennington). The new second high school building was erected on the same previous site, however was reoriented and turned to face its front to the north on the south side of West Centre Street, midway between Eutaw and Howard Streets, and facing the buildings to the north of the first downtown campus of 1876–1915 of Johns Hopkins University. This new 1899 building however quickly became overcrowded in the first decades of the 20th century and an annex was built further north on East 26th Street in Peabody Heights for underclassmen.

The school&#x27;s enrollment increased significantly during World War I and alumni began organizing a campaign to build a larger building with a modern surrounding campus grounds with a grass lawn during the early 1920s. In 1922, a nationwide architectural contest was held for various plans to be submitted for the future &quot;capstone of the Baltimore and Maryland public education system&quot;. In 1926, ground was broken for a massive Collegiate Gothic stone edifice designed by the local architects Buckler and Fenhagen (one of whom was a City College graduate himself) on renamed &quot;Collegian Hill&quot; at the southwest corner of newly laid-out boulevards with park-like landscaped median strips at 33rd Street and The Alameda. Buckler and Fenhagen&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral of Learning&quot; was designed to accommodate 2,500 students and cost almost $3 million dollars (equivalent to $ in ), making it one of the most expensive school projects in America up to that time. It won a regional architecture prize / medal as contributing to the Baltimore landscape in 1928. The new high school and campus grounds officially opened April 10, 1928.

The main academic rubble stone building with limestone trim, featured cornices, cloisters, carved gargoyles and sculpture, arched huge tall windows with colored stained glass leaded panes for the front / northeast side of the two-story high ceiling Library, Lecture Hall and center Trophy Hall (which were unfortunately removed during the 1977–1979 renovation project), mahogany wood paneling, stone block front entry foyer, plaster corridor arches, elaborate lighting chandeliers, terra cotta tiles, and polished terrazzo floors with two inside courtyards. The new &quot;Castle&quot; was designed by architects Buckler and Fenhagen to be expanded in the future with the addition of additional E-shaped similar stone Collegiate Gothic style wings / buildings on the northwest and northeast corners facing the Upper Campus planned for future B.C.C. expansion plus a possible companion junior high / middle school. A proposed clock and set of carillon bells system for the central landmark tower were left unfinished. Unfortunately fifteen years later during the early &quot;black-out&quot; years of World War II (1939/1941-1945), the beautiful multi-colored stained glass ceiling / skylight over the central auditorium with its wrap-around balcony was unfortunately covered / tarred over.

Following the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; in May 1954, and the summer long deliberations of the Board of School Commissioners the decision to racially integrate all Baltimore public schools was made. City admitted its first Black / African American students in September 1954.

Two years later the Maryland Scholastic Association integrated its sports competitions, opening to formerly segregated black City high schools: Frederick Douglass, Paul Lawrence Dunbar and Carver Vo-Tech in 1956.

Two years later, the first Black faculty members in 116 years of school history were assigned to the B.C.C., Mr. Pierre H. Davis to the Business Education and Mr. Eugene Parker to the Physical Education Departments. Mr. Davis returned 15 years later in September 1970, after his brief faculty time at the Castle during the 1950s, as the fifteenth and first Black principal of the City College, serving four years.

Enrollment at the City College reached a record high of nearly 4,000 male students by the mid-1960s, mostly due to the post-World War II &quot;baby boom&quot; and the lack of additional high schools in the outer reaches of Baltimore City. Following the construction / opening of several new high schools, enrollment began to decline by the mid-1970s.

After the crisis levels of overcrowding with the instigation of &quot;split -shifts&quot; during the previous decade to now contending with the reverse problems of declining enrollment which reached a low of about 1,500 students in 1973, the school&#x27;s academic standards also began to decline. The school&#x27;s once-prestigious &quot;A-Course&quot; (Advanced College Preparatory Course) academic track since the 1920s was discontinued in 1973 and a single academic track was offered in 1973–76 in a misguided improvement proposal however without any additional funding for the additional curriculum or strict admissions standards.

In 1978, using a half-million dollars originally earmarked for a swimming pool, a starter agreement was made with the City and state-wide school construction program to the main academic building. The renovations would require the school to temporarily relocate for two years. In 1979 the City admitted female students for the first time in its then-140-year history.

The Castle&#x27;s academic decline continued during the late 1970s, until under new hand-picked Principal Solomon Lausch celebrated the return of City College to its Castle in rededication ceremonies on the front upper campus highlighted by the appearance of a replica medieval-garbed &quot;Black Knight&quot; mascot (used since 1950) riding on a gray horse posing for photos in front of stone battlements once more occupied by &quot;Collegians&quot; after a two-year absence. Lausch&#x27;s administration lasted over a decade giving stable direction and enforcing the academic goals and principles of the Task Force&#x27;s recommendations from 1977 to 1979 for a revived resurgent and especially resurgent proud &quot;New Baltimore City College&quot;.

The 1990s, under Principal Joseph Antenson saw a new program introduced, a revamped curriculum, raised admissions standards, and secured increased funding and unique local autonomy from the Baltimore City Public Schools&#x27;s Board of School Commissioners oversight and direction. B.C.C.&#x27;s continued advancement and 15 years of a turn-around accelerated when Joseph Wilson, a former attorney-at-law, in 1994 to lead the school. Principal Wilson strengthened academic standards by introducing the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program in September 1998. By the early-2000s, the City College was once again routinely counted among the state, region and nation&#x27;s best public high schools. The B.C.C. was recognized at the start of the 1999–2000 academic year by the U.S. Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School.

== Campus ==

The Baltimore City College stands on an expansive, tree-shaded 38-acre (153,781 m2) hill-top campus in northeast Baltimore at the intersection of 33rd Street and the Alameda. The campus consists of two buildings: the Collegiate Gothic architecture-style central / main edifice known locally as the &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; which sits in the center of the landscaped with many trees on the hill-top campus, and the flanking power plant building also built 1926–1928, across a faculty parking lot, further east of the Castle. In addition to providing the building&#x27;s utilities, the power plant building originally housed five workshops: an electrical shop, a mechanical shop, a metal shop, a printing shop, and a wood shop. It currently houses the Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello community corporation headquarters. Both buildings of 1926–1928 and a later similar matching style of a north expansion annex wing added in 1958 for the then additional music rooms were designed in a similar Gothic style architecture using red brick and limestone trim by the same architecture firm of Buckler and Fenhagen.

The &quot;Castle&quot; features an iconic landmark 150-foot-tall Gothic style architecture central tower (designed originally to hold a set of clocks on its four facades plus a carillon bells system that were never installed after its 1928 opening due to &quot;Great Depression&quot; budget cutbacks after the famous October 1929 Stock Market Crash) that is visible from many locations throughout Baltimore. South of the main academic building is the renamed George Petrides Stadium at Alumni Field, which serves as home to the school&#x27;s athletic teams, with a grandstand for especially football, with adjoining fields for baseball, soccer and tennis courts. During a major building renovation in 1977–1979, a modern larger gymnasium was added to the southwest corner of the main building, replacing the old narrow gym (nicknamed &quot;The Crackerbox&quot;) on the south side, used 1928 to 1977.

In June 2003, the current &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, besides also being listed as a &quot;Baltimore City Landmark&quot;. The listing of the building coincided with the structure&#x27;s 75th anniversary. On April 24, 2007, the building was also designated a &quot;Baltimore City Landmark&quot;, which means that the building&#x27;s exterior cannot be altered without approval of the city&#x27;s Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation. On June 21, 2007, the school&#x27;s Alumni Association received a historic preservation award from the presentation organization Baltimore Heritage for its leadership role in preserving the building as an historic Baltimore landmark. In 2017, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; magazine named the school the most beautiful public high school in the state of Maryland and on the list as one of the most beautiful in the nation, which was also noted in several local television station&#x27;s news reports.

===B.C.C. Center for Teaching and Learning===

City College launched in 2015 the Torch Burning Bright campaign, a fundraising effort to modernize and rehab its library and student resource center. The $2.2 million dollars project was designed by the local firm JRS Architects and added new spaces for resource stacks; new areas for studying and reading; The central Great Hall (formerly Trophy Hall( had its original polished slate floor which had been covered with carpeting in 1977–79 renovations, was restored and reconfigured as a large communal space and reading room; additional new classrooms, seminar spaces, and conference rooms, a new location for library special collections and school archives, a listening and viewing room for audio / visual material, and office space for school library staff.

The B.C.C. Center for Teaching and Learning opened to students and faculty in January 2016 and is staffed by five full-time professionals, including the center director, the head librarian, and three staff coordinating each academic center. In all, the Center for Teaching and Learning includes the following resources for students:
* Cordish Technology Center
* Doetsch Hall, the school&#x27;s premier meeting and presentation space
* Joseph Meyerhoff Library, the school&#x27;s main library on campus featuring physical and digital collections
* Reed Math and Science Center
* The Writing Center
* The Research Center

== Academics ==

===Mission===
When it was founded in March 1839 as the flagship school of what later became the Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore City College was charged with providing a unique classics- and liberal arts-based course of study and with holding all members of its school community to the highest standards of academic achievement and personal development. The school&#x27;s stated mission is to prepare its students to succeed in the best colleges in the United States, with a focus on liberal arts.

===19th-century curriculum: the five-year course era===

The creation of a male high school &quot;in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively&quot; was authorized unanimously by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839. The school opened its doors October 20, 1839, with 46 students. Those enrolled were offered two academic tracks, a classical literature track and an English literature track. The sole instructor for both tracks was the educator and poet, Nathan C. Brooks, who also served as principal. To accommodate the two tracks, Brooks split the school day into two sections: one in the morning from 9 a.m. to 12 a.m., and another in the afternoon from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English. In 1849, after a decade of service, Prof. Brooks resigned as principal of the school, which had now grown to include 232 students and 7 teachers, excluding Brooks.

Rev. Dr. Francis G. Waters, who had been the president of the Washington College, succeeded Brooks. The following year the city council renamed the school &quot;The Central High School of Baltimore&quot; and granted the commissioners of the public schools the right to confer certificates to the high school&#x27;s graduates, a practice still in place today. By 1850, growing enrollment necessitated a reorganization of the school. Under the direction of Waters, the school day was divided into eight periods lasting forty-five minutes: four sessions were held in the morning and four in the afternoon. In addition to reorganizing the schedule, he divided the courses into seven different departments: Belles-letters and history, mathematics, natural sciences, moral, mental, and political science, ancient languages, modern languages and music. Each of the seven instructors was assigned to a distinct department and received the title of &quot;professor&quot;.

In 1850, the Baltimore City Council granted the school the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion. An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then-named &quot;Central High School of Baltimore&quot; to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began in 1865, and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as &quot;The Baltimore City College&quot; the retitling of its chief academic officer from &quot;principal&quot; to &quot;president&quot;, along with an increase in the number of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses. However, despite this early elevation effort, it ended unsuccessfully in 1869, although Baltimore City College continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of junior college (later known as community college) which did not fully appear in America until the beginning of the 20th century. As the importance of college education increased toward the end of the 19th century, the school&#x27;s priorities shifted to preparing students for college.

===20th-century curriculum: the A/B course era===

In 1901, the course of study at Baltimore City College went through a series of further changes. The most significant was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits. From 1927 to the early 1990s, the college preparatory curriculum at Baltimore City College was divided into two tracks: the &quot;A&quot; course and the &quot;B&quot; course. Though both tracks were intended to provide students with the skills necessary for college, the &quot;A&quot; course was intended to be more rigorous, enabling students to complete sufficient college-level courses to enter directly into the second year of college. In the early-1990s, then-Principal Joseph Antenson removed the two-tier system because he believed it to be racially discriminatory.

====The 1960s and 1970s====
Population decline in the city of Baltimore due to the migration of middle-class white populations to the suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the failure of Baltimore City Public Schools officials to address infrastructure improvements needed in the school&#x27;s deteriorating, then-thirty-seven-year-old main academic building lead to a gradually declining public perception of the school&#x27;s academic reputation. In response, school administrators and faculty developed the &quot;City Forever&quot; strategic plan in 1965–66. The performance improvement plan also served as a call to action for the school community, resulting in formal recommendations from the Alumni Association, a series of student-led demonstrations, newspaper articles and television news segments produced by alumni working as media professionals, letters-to-the-editors of local newspapers submitted by parents and teachers, and routine public comments in support of City College at School Board meetings. The public outcry stunned city leadership, which resulted in the district announcing a recommitment to Baltimore City College and its unique role as the selective flagship high school of Baltimore.

Over the next decade, the local school district failed to delivery on its pledge to adequately fund the revitalized Baltimore City College curriculum and enforce higher admissions standards. In 1975, City students, faculty, and influential alumni like then-Mayor of Baltimore William Donald Schaefer &#x27;39 and then-City Comptroller Hyman A. Pressman &#x27;33 again engaged in a series of coordinated campaigns, urging political leaders and members of the school board to provide the resources and enforce the high standards the school needs to succeed. As a result, the City of Baltimore announced its plan to advance funds to complete a $9 million renovation of the school&#x27;s main building and earmarked funding for a comprehensive, two-year study (1977–79). Subject matter experts in education and pedagogy, school faculty, parents, alumni, and other members of the school community formed the &quot;New City College Task Force&quot;. The task force, which combed through two decades of previous improvement plans, academic proposals, and experimental curricula, recommended to the school board a plan that included stricter admissions and retention standards, a revitalized humanities- and liberal arts-based curriculum, and the autonomy to selectively recruit new, highly qualified faculty and administrators.

The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners ultimately accepted all but one of the task force&#x27;s recommendations in 1979. The group recommended maintaining the school&#x27;s then-141-year-old tradition of all-male education. Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which had not yet been resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, the school board voted to make City a coeducational school. The board&#x27;s action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.

====The 1990s====

By 1990, enrollment was declining and the academic program at Baltimore City College had once again become subpar compared to its historically high standards. The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, the organization that had accredited the school for years, began raising questions about the institution&#x27;s ability to offer students an academically rigorous course of study. During this period of decline, the &quot;A&quot; Course was discontinued by newly appointed Principal Joseph Antenson, who contended that the program was racially discriminatory and opted for a standardized curriculum. Antenson was dismissed in 1992 after two tumultuous years as head of school and for the first time ever a private contractor was hired to operate Baltimore City College.

In 1994, Joseph M. Wilson, a lawyer by trade with degrees from Amherst College (B.A.), the University of Pennsylvania (M.A.), the University of Southern California (J.D.), and Harvard University (M.A.), was appointed principal and with the support of alumni and parents, was able to secure more funding and additional autonomy from the Baltimore City Public Schools. Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school&#x27;s academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, and the quality of the colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto &quot;National Post&quot; reported on its search for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.

===21st-century curriculum===
International Baccalaureate (IB) is a rigorous, internationally accepted academic program required of all 21st century Baltimore City College students. The IB Middle Years Program is intended to teach freshman and sophomore students to understand how core subjects are interrelated, how to master critical thinking processes, and to increase intercultural awareness. As juniors and seniors, students engage in the rigorous two-year IB Diploma curriculum that requires a comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College&#x27;s IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.

Despite some concerns of the school&#x27;s alumni association, school administrators proceeded with plans to expand the City College IB Program by incorporating the IB Middle Years Program into the 9th and 10th grade curricula. In addition to the IB courses, the school&#x27;s academic program offers a small selection of Advanced Placement courses.

====International Baccalaureate course offerings====
As of the 2015–2016 school year, the International Baccalaureate courses below are offered at the school. Some courses are offered at the higher level (HL) and standard level (SL).

===Graduation requirements===
Students who successfully complete the school&#x27;s required curriculum earn the Baltimore City College diploma upon graduation, which has been granted since 1851. The requirements are more stringent than those designated by the State of Maryland.

Requirements for the Baltimore City College Diploma:
* Successful completion of a minimum of one IB Diploma- or Certificate-level course, or AP course
* Successful completion of the IB Personal Project
* Physics or an advanced-level IB/AP science
* Two Fine Arts courses (requirement waived for IB Diploma candidates)
* Successful completion of the College Writing seminar (requirement waived for IB Diploma candidates and students enrolled in IB English IV)
* Minimum cumulative GPA of 70%
* Submit admission applications to a minimum of four colleges (including FAFSA submission)
* Take the SAT or ACT at least two times
* 75 hours of documented Service Learning activity

==Admissions==
Admission to Baltimore City College is selective but is open to residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding counties in the metropolitan area, though non-Baltimore City residents must pay tuition. Applicants must meet all requirements for promotion to ninth grade, as determined by the Maryland State Department of Education. Additionally, applicants must earn a minimum composite score of 610, calculated by Baltimore City Public Schools. Generally, candidates for admission must have a 3.0 overall numeric grade average (B letter grade; 80 or better percentage grade), have at least a 3.0 average in both Mathematics and English, rank in the 65th percentile or better among all Maryland students in Math and English on the Maryland School Assessment (MSA), and have 90% or better attendance rate. Due to the highly competitive nature of the City College admissions process, successful applicants typically exceed the aforementioned minimums. J.D. Merrill, BCC &#x27;09, is the school&#x27;s current Director of Admissions and Institutional Advancement.

== Enrollment ==
There were 1494 students enrolled at Baltimore City College in 2022. Of those students, 39 percent were male and 61 percent were female. 67.5 percent of the total student body identifies as African-American. 17.4 percent of students at the school identify as white. Roughly 12 percent of City College students identify as Hispanic. A little over one percent of the total student population identifies as Asian.

==Athletics==
Interscholastic athletics at Baltimore City College date back over 120 years. Though varsity sports were not formally organized until 1895, interscholastic athletics became a fixture at the school earlier in the 19th century with some documentation of activity going back to the 1870s. The annual tradition of a football game with Baltimore Manual Training School, started in 1889. The two schools were only separated by about five city blocks in the downtown area and oral tradition holds that a match was held between the B.C.C. &quot;Collegians&quot; and the B.M.T.S. &quot;scrubs&quot; at a field in the newly municipal acquired Clifton Park. By 1893, the Manual Training &quot; School itself was renamed as the &quot;Baltimore Polytechnic Institute&quot; (B.P.I. or &quot;Poly&quot;).

By the early 1890s, the City College was playing in the newly organized Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (M.I.F.A.), a nine-member athletic league consisting of colleges and schools in Washington, D.C., and Maryland area. City College was the lone secondary school among the old MIFA membership. The B.C.C. 1895 football schedule included St. John&#x27;s College of Annapolis, Swarthmore College, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, the former Maryland Agriculture College, (which later became after a 1920 merger (with the older original University of Maryland at Baltimore campus since 1807) to become the University of Maryland at College Park, and also the Washington College across the Chesapeake Bay in Chestertown, Maryland (on the Eastern Shore of Maryland). Between 1894 and 1920, the City College &quot;Collegians&quot; regularly faced off also against their neighbors at Howard and Centre Streets of the Johns Hopkins University &quot;Blue Jays&quot; and the Navy Midshipmen in our state&#x27;s team sport of lacrosse.

The Baltimore City College began competing on a regular extensive program schedule against the then few other public high schools and the many more numerous private / independent or parochial secondary schools in 1919 when it was invited to join the Maryland Scholastic Association (M.S.A.) as a founding member institution, with its organizing co-founder and B.C.C. teacher / coach (and future 10th Principal) Dr. Philip H. Edwards leading to form the new public / private athletic league. After 74 years of governing Baltimore metro area boys&#x27; high school athletics, the old Maryland Scholastic Association dissolved in 1993 when its 15 public high school members from the Baltimore City Public Schools including City College, withdrew from the public / private schools athletic league. Baltimore City&#x27;s high schools then joined the larger state association of public secondary schools, the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association.

The &quot;Black Knights&quot; currently compete with other public secondary schools in the MPSSAA Class 3A, North Region, District 9.

The current City College varsity athletic program consists of 18 sports: six for boys, seven for girls, and five coeducational teams. The boys&#x27; sports includes baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer, and wrestling. The girls&#x27; sports are badminton, basketball, lacrosse, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The five co-ed sports are cross country, indoor track and field, swimming, outdoor track and field, and tennis. Girls&#x27; sports were added to City&#x27;s athletic department in the fall of 1978 when the reorganized &quot;magnet high school&quot; became coeducational for the first time in its then-139-year-old history.

===Basketball===

Basketball has been played at Baltimore City College for more than a century and a quarter dating back to the introduction of the new sport in America in the 1890s. One of the earliest recorded results in program history is a one-point overtime road loss to the future University of Maryland at College Park&#x27;s &quot;Terrapins&quot; (then known as the Maryland Agricultural College &quot;Aggies&quot; or &quot;Cadets&quot;) on January 25, 1913. 
Baltimore City College currently competes in District 9 (Baltimore City League) of the MPSSAA.

=== Football ===

The Baltimore City College football program began in the mid-1870s, and has won more than 20 M.S.A. &quot;A-Conference&quot; and championships in its history. The Knights primarily competed against area colleges and universities throughout the 1880s and 1890s because only a few secondary schools existed at the time. The program began competing against other high schools at the beginning of the 20th century, especially after the 1919 organization of the old MSA and has held since 1941 the record for the longest streak of games played without a loss in MSA and MPSSAA history. The &quot;Collegians&quot; played 54 consecutive games without a loss between 1934 and 1941. Harry Lawrence, who guided the Castle footballers to a 38-game undefeated streak between 1936 and 1940 (including 35 wins, three ties, and four MSA championships), remains City College&#x27;s most successful head football coach.

==== City–Poly rivalry (1889–present) ====
The City-Poly football rivalry is the oldest American football rivalry in Maryland, and one of the oldest public school football rivalries in the United States. The rivalry began in 1889, when the City College met the old Baltimore Manual Training School (later renamed the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute - &quot;Poly&quot; after 1893) at the old Johns Hopkins country estate for a football scrimmage in which City&#x27;s freshman team beat the new B.M.T.S. team. City remained undefeated in the growing series according to the records until 1908.

With City&#x27;s 40 to 0 win in 2024, City now leads the series with a record of 66–62, with 6 ties. 2024 marked City&#x27;s 12th straight win of the series.

===Swimming===
On February 22, 2020, at the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association 3A, 2A, 1A swimming and diving championships held in College Park, City&#x27;s swim team finished in 14th place. City sophomore Taj Benton led the Knights, finishing 1st in the 100-yard butterfly and 4th in the 200-yard individual medley. Benton is the first student from a Baltimore City public school to win a state championship in any statewide swimming event.

== Extracurricular activities ==
Baltimore City College offers more than 20 student clubs and organizations. These include chapters of national organizations such as the National Honor Society (established at the school in 1927) and Quill and Scroll. Service clubs include the Red Cross Club and Campus Improvement Association. Other activities include the Drama Club, which produces an annual play, the Art Club, Model UN, Band, Dance, and One City One Book, an organization that invites the entire school community to read one book selected by faculty and invites the author of the book for a reading, discussion, and question and answer period. In 2007, Pulitzer Prize winner, MacArthur Fellow, and novelist Edward P. Jones discussed his book &quot;Lost in the City&quot;. The school store is operated by students and managed by the Student Government Association. City&#x27;s academic team participates on &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;, a local version of the syndicated nationwide television show, seen on WJZ-TV, (Channel 13), usually on Saturday mornings.

=== Speech and debate/literary and debating societies ===
The Baltimore City College debate team has a tradition that dates back over 150 years. The speech and debate teams are formally referred to as the Bancroft and Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies. The school&#x27;s first formal debate team within a student literary society was established in 1876 as the Bancroft Literary Association. In 1878, a second competing rival society, the Carrollton Literary Society, was formed, named for Maryland&#x27;s famous longest-living signer of the Declaration of Independence, the wealthiest man then in colonial era America and the only Roman Catholic member / signer in the Second Continental Congress of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), representing Maryland. That society was later renamed the &quot;Carrollton-Wight Literary Society&quot;, in honor of the group&#x27;s first advisor, Professor Charles Wight, a celebrated faculty member during the 1870s, while the high school was then located in the first B.C.C. building of two on the site at Howard and Centre Streets, from 1875 to 1892, then 1899 to 1928.

The speech and debate team competes in various speech events, Student Congress, Mock Trial, Lincoln-Douglas debate, and Policy Debate against teams throughout Maryland and routinely travels around the United States to compete on the national circuit. The team currently participates in four competitive debate leagues: the Baltimore Catholic Forensic League, the Baltimore Urban Debate League, the Chesapeake region of the National Catholic Forensic League, and the National Forensic League. Several community partners, including the Abell Foundation and the Baltimore Community Foundation, which endowed the Gilbert Sandler Fund for Speech and Debate in 2008, help provide financial support to the program.

=== Bands and orchestra ===

The marching band at Baltimore City College was created in the late 1940s. At the time, the instrumental music program consisted of the orchestra, concert band, and marching band. The director who brought the band to prominence was Dr. Donald Norton. In 1954, while on sabbatical, he was replaced by Professor Charles M. Stengstacke. The 65 member concert band doubled as a marching band in the fall. During halftime performances at home the band would form the shape of a heart or a car, but always ending the performance by forming the letters C-I-T-Y.

In the 1980s, under James Russell Perkins, these groups grew in size and changed styles, adding &quot;soulful&quot; dance steps. Perkins&#x27;s groups toured and traveled the east coast. They received superior ratings at district and state festivals. Perkins is responsible for the creation of the City College Jazz Band, the &quot;Knights of Jazz&quot;. In 1994, Alvin T. Wallace became Band Director. During his tenure, a wind ensemble was added and the marching band grew to include over 150 members. In 1999, the band swept the top categories in the Disney World high school band competition. In 2006, the wind ensemble received a grade of superior at the district adjudication festival and marched in the Baltimore Mayor&#x27;s Christmas Day Parade.

=== Choirs ===

The Baltimore City College choir was founded in 1950 by Professor Donald Regier. Originally a co-curricular subject with only 18 members, by 1954 it had developed into a major subject of study with 74 students enrolled.
Under the direction of Linda Hall, today&#x27;s choir consists of four groups: the Mixed Chorus, the Concert Choir, the Singin&#x27;/Swingin&#x27; Knights, and the Knights and Daze Show Choir.

The Mixed Choir is opened to all students at City College and currently has a membership of approximately 135 students. The Concert Choir is a more selective group consisting of about 50 students, who must audition for their places in the choir. The Singin&#x27;/Swingin&#x27; Knights is an even more selective group composed of 25 students. The Knights and Daze Show Choir is a group of students, who perform a choreographed dance routine while they sing. With the exception of the Knights and Daze Show Choir, which performs jazz and pop music, the choir&#x27;s repertoire consists of gospel music, spirituals, and Classical works by composers such as Handel and Michael Praetorius.
The choir has traveled to Europe on several occasions. Its first trip was in 1999, after receiving an invitation to perform at the Choralfest in Arezzo, Italy. In 2003, the choir returned to Italy to perform at the annual Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The choir has also performed in France and Spain. On October 2, 2007, the Weill Institute of Music at Carnegie Hall announced that the City College choir was one of four high school choirs selected to participate in the National High School Choral Festival on March 10, 2008. The four choirs performed Johannes Brahms&#x27; &quot;A German Requiem&quot; under the direction of Craig Jessop, Mormon Tabernacle Choir Director. The choirs were led by their own directors in performing choral selections of their choosing.

== Student publications ==

=== &quot;The Green Bag&quot; ===
&quot;The Green Bag&quot; is the senior class and school annual / yearbook at The Baltimore City College. Published continuously since 1896, it is now approaching Volume 128 of publication. &quot;The Bag&quot; is the oldest publication still in existence and printed / issued usually annually at the school and is one of the oldest high school or college yearbooks in America. G. Warfield Hobbs Jr. (later became a well-known Episcopal priest and academic doctor), president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of &quot;The Green Bag&quot;, gave the publication its longtime distinctive unique name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political, and legal / judicial leadership. Historically, the famous green &quot;carpet bag&quot; in the 19th century containing the lists of political appointees (also known as &quot;patronage&quot;) of the sitting Governor of Maryland to be approved by the General Assembly of Maryland has long been known as the &quot;green bag&quot; lists (and is still referred to as such by modern-day local press journalists, reporters and editors including the newer media of television and radio, although the derivation of the term is unknown. The term has already been researched into its origins by the staff at the Maryland State Archives / Hall of Records at the state capital of Annapolis, most recently in 2003. The term became synonymous with &quot;good news&quot; and &quot;glad tidings&quot;, such as could be applied to the feelings that recent graduates felt when seeing and reading their new yearbooks published soon after their graduations.

The first yearbooks contained sketches of faculty and seniors, and included recollections, anecdotes, stories, and quotes significant to the student body. Underclassmen were included for the first time with individual portraits in the growing student body in 1948. In 2007, &quot;The Green Bag&quot; released its first full-color edition, one of the most colorful since color printing of photographs was first introduced in &quot;The Bag&quot; in 1963 and again in 1967, repeated in 1972 under new publisher / printer of Josten&#x27;s American Yearbook Company. For many years the annual was printed by the local well-known printer/publisher of H.G. Roebuck and Son, owned by a City alumnus up to 1970 The most controversial issue of &quot;The Green Bag&quot; was the so-called &quot;Green Bag Affair&quot; celebrated and described in the several local daily newspapers of the time and read by many turn-of-the-century Baltimoreans. Volume 5 of the still new concept of a school or class yearbook published in the millennial year of 1900 when members of the senior Class of 1900, used the annual to make fun of their professors, printing a cartoon showing various faculty members (easily identifiable) as distinctive, unique and rare exhibited specimen animals in a group of cages as in a zoo!!. The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners were not however greatly amused or tolerant feeling betrayed and insulted themselves by the young Collegians and attempted to censor the edition by requiring &quot;The Green Bag&quot; to be reviewed by then President / Principal Francis A. Soper. The yearbook had however already been printed, and in defiance of the School Board, the editors refused to have the edition censored, cutting out the offensive cartoon and reprinted. The School Board responded by withholding the treasured City College diplomas of six of the offending editors and the business manager and by preventing the city&#x27;s premier high school from holding a public commencement ceremony which were often attended by the general public in those days as one of only five secondary schools in the region or have the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, a quarter-century later even became a member of the very same School Board himself in 1926. Coincidentally, the infamous cartoon was later printed for the first time in an issue of &quot;The Bag&quot; in an opening feature segment with a B.C.C. chronology and historical photos / illustrations montage on Castle school history in 1972 in Volume 77.

=== &quot;The Collegian&quot; ===
&quot;The Collegian&quot; has been the school student newspaper of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929. There have been other similar publications, such as &quot;The Oriole&quot;, the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however &quot;The Collegian&quot; is oldest, continuous student-run publication. Originally, the newspaper was both managed and printed by students. During the 1930s, &quot;The Collegian&quot; won numerous awards including second place in the Columbia Scholastic Press Association&#x27;s annual contest for five years in a row. Since 2000, printing of the publication has been scaled back. &quot;The Collegian&quot; is now published quarterly, often with a bonus issue around the time of the annual City-Poly football game. Since 2014, &quot;The Collegian&quot; also actively engages students and alumni through various social media platforms.

== Alumni Association ==

The Baltimore City College Alumni Association Inc. (BCCAA) was established in 1866 as a support network for City College. The BCCAA holds an annual meeting at the school every November and its board of governors meets the first Monday of each month at the school.

The BCCAA publishes the class reunion guide, established and maintains a life membership endowment fund, presents Golden Apple Awards annually to faculty members, sponsors the Hall of Fame selection and induction, publishes a semi-annual newsletter, maintains an alumni database, and assists with projects designed to enrich student life and improve the school&#x27;s facilities.

=== Trustees of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds ===
The Trustees of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was established and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that was established in 1924. The Trustees manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by the donors. Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships. To recognize the custodianship provided by the Trustees, the BCCAA has placed a bronze plaque in the main hall of the school which carries an individually cast nameplate for each of the thirty-four permanent endowments held by the Trustees.

=== Baltimore City College Hall of Fame ===
The Baltimore City College Hall of Fame induction ceremony is held annually in October. Alumni who have demonstrated extraordinary service to the school, city, state, country, or world are elected to the Hall of Fame, with former inductees, alumni, and students attending the two-hour ceremony. Inductees have included vice-president at Goldman Sachs Robert Hormats in 2007, and Maryland State delegate Curt Anderson in 2013.

== Notable alumni ==
Many City College alumni have become civil servants, including three of the 10 individuals currently representing the state of Maryland in the U.S. Congress, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger and Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. Among graduates with significant military service are two Commandants of the U.S. Coast Guard – Rear Admiral Frederick C. Billard and Admiral J. William Kime, as well as 2nd Lieutenant Jacob Beser of the U.S. Army Marines the only individual to serve on both atomic bomb missions over Japan in 1945.

<doc id="713982" wikidata="Q2856301" url="?curid=713982" title="Doctor Light (Arthur Light)">
<text>Doctor Light is the name of two characters appearing in media published by DC Comics: supervillain Arthur Light and superhero Jacob Finlay.

Light&#x27;s stint as Doctor Light is concurrent with that of a superheroine using the same name and a nearly identical costume, Kimiyo Hoshi. In 2009, Doctor Light was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 84th-greatest comic book villain of all time.

He made his live-adaptation debut in one episode of the series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, played by David Bowe. He also appeared in the second season of the DC Universe series &quot;Titans&quot;, played by Michael Mosley. A female version of the character appeared in the second season of &quot;The Flash&quot; played by the actress Victoria Park.

==Publication history==
Doctor Light first appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #12 and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky.

During the 1980s Doctor Light was transitioned from a serious menace to a comedic villain, a transformation which culminated in the DC Comics Bonus Book appearing in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #12 (May 1988).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Criminal physicist Doctor Arthur Light captures the League with light rays after first drawing them in by capturing Aquaman, then sending the League to different planets based on their weaknesses. He then orders Snapper Carr to write this down before imprisoning him in a light field. He has not realized Superman and Batman impersonated each other, allowing Superman to escape the world he was sent to and rescue the other members. Light fools the League with three duplicates of himself that are apparently committing robberies of light-associated objects, though they are actually placing devices around the world. Green Lantern realizes this trick and fakes his death to track Doctor Light, finally stopping him before he pulls the lever that would have set off the light impulses allowing him to take over the world.

&quot;Secret Origins&quot; #37 reveals that Light is the second Doctor Light. His predecessor is S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Jacob Finlay, who created a light-manipulating suit and became a superhero before Light accidentally killed him and took the suit and codename.

Through the Silver and Bronze Ages, Doctor Light is a minor but persistent foe for a number of heroes, including the Justice League&#x27;s former sidekicks, the Teen Titans.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #136, he is one of King Kull&#x27;s agents with which the Beast-Man hopes to wipe out humanity on all three Earths, helping in the attack on Earth-S by creating perpetual light and darkness on each side of the Earth, and teaming up with Shade, Joker of Earth-Two, and Weeper. He is petrified by Kull&#x27;s satellites, but restored when they are destroyed.

He then founds the supervillain team the Fearsome Five, but they are also defeated by the Titans, and Light is violently expelled from the group.

===Suicide Squad===
Driven by self-doubt and guilt, as well as Finlay&#x27;s ghost haunting him, Light joins the Suicide Squad, a group of incarcerated supervillains who perform dangerous missions for the government in exchange for clemency. During a mission on Apokolips, Light is killed by Parademons and sent to Hell. After being resurrected, Light attempts to rejoin the Suicide Squad, but Amanda Waller rejects him. Subsequently, he joins a short-lived incarnation of the Injustice Gang.

===&quot;Identity Crisis&quot; onwards===
&quot;Identity Crisis&quot; reveals that Doctor Light is a serial rapist and previously raped Sue Dibny. Zatanna magically alters his mind so that he will no longer pose a threat and inadvertently lobotomizes him. Light later recovers his memories and vows revenge against the Justice League. He joins Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains before being killed by the Spectre during &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, he is resurrected as a Black Lantern before Hoshi kills him.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Arthur Light is a scientist working with A.R.G.U.S. and the Justice League who gains light-based powers after his communicator explodes. He subsequently joins the Justice League before being killed by Atomica and resurrected as a light entity.

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Light can control light for a variety of purposes. He can bend the light around him to become invisible, generate blasts of energy, create force fields, and fly. By mentally repulsing photons, Light can create areas of complete darkness. &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #23 implied that Light could &quot;power up&quot; by draining the ambient light in the area.

The limits of his powers are unclear, but he seems to be able to wrest control of anything that emits light. Such things have included Green Lantern constructs, Superboy&#x27;s heat vision, and magic lightning from Wonder Girl&#x27;s lasso. He is also able to take the &quot;internal&quot; light away from light powered characters, the heroic Doctor Light and the Ray, leaving them temporarily powerless. He also has the ability to create holographic images. Despite his frequent defeats, he is quite powerful.

Originally, Doctor Light derives his powers from his suit, but over time he internalizes this ability, and could use his powers without having to use his costume.

Arthur Light is mentally brilliant, a genius in the field of physics. However, his mind-wipe by the Justice League reduces his intelligence substantially, along with his skills for creative use of his powers. Light&#x27;s recovery of his memories seems to have brought his intellect back with them and also his paraphilia. As a result, he becomes a much deadlier opponent.

<text>Richard Francis Needham, 6th Earl of Kilmorey, (born 29 January 1942), usually known as Sir Richard Needham, is a British Conservative politician. A Member of Parliament from 1979 to 1997, he served as Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1985 and 1992 and as Minister of State for Trade between 1992 and 1995. From January 1961 until April 1977, he was entitled to use the courtesy title Viscount Newry and Mourne.

==Early life==
Needham is the eldest of the three sons of the 5th Earl of Kilmorey by his marriage to Helen Bridget Faudel-Phillips, a daughter of Sir Lionel Faudel-Phillips, 3rd and last Baronet. He was educated at Eton. When his father succeeded as the 5th Earl of Kilmorey in January 1961, Needham became entitled to use the courtesy title Viscount Newry and Mourne, or Lord Newry. In April 1977 he succeeded his father and became the 6th Earl.

==Political career==
Needham was a member of the Somerset County Council between 1967 and 1974. In 1974, he stood unsuccessfully for parliament for the safe Labour seat of Pontefract and Castleford in the February general election, and was then also defeated at the more marginal Gravesend in October. 
He succeeded his father to the earldom in 1977. This is an Irish peerage and did not bar him from sitting in the House of Commons. At the 1979 general election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Chippenham in Wiltshire. He was one of the &quot;Wiltshire Wets&quot;, Conservative MPs from the county who expressed concern at the perceived loss of jobs resulting from the &quot;monetarist&quot; policies of Margaret Thatcher; in 1990 he called Thatcher &quot;a cow&quot; in a leaked telephone conversation with his wife. His constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, when he was returned to the House of Commons for the new North Wiltshire constituency. He held the seat until he retired from Parliament at the 1997 general election.

===In Government===

Needham was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, between 1983 and 1984, and to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Patrick Jenkin, between 1984 and 1985. He served under Thatcher and later John Major as an Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1985 and 1992 and under Major as Minister of State for Trade between 1992 and 1995, and was instrumental in transforming Northern Ireland&#x27;s economic base and the UK&#x27;s export strategy under Michael Heseltine. He was the longest serving British government Northern Ireland minister.

==Books==

Lord Kilmorey has written three books: &quot;Honourable Member&quot; and &quot;Battling for Peace: Northern Ireland&#x27;s Longest-Serving British Minister&quot; (1999); an account of his years in Northern Ireland and his contribution to peace. and &quot;One Man Two Worlds&quot; (2021) a memoir of his life in politics and business

==Honours==
Lord Kilmorey holds an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Ulster. A founder member of the UK-Japan 21st Century Group, he was appointed a member of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, by the Emperor of Japan.He was appointed the Order of San Carlos by Juan Manuel Santos, President of Colombia for his work on the Peace Process in Colombia. 
He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1994 and knighted in 1997.

==Personal life==
Needham married Sigrid Thiessen-Gairdner, daughter of Ernst Thiessen, in 1965. They have three children:

*Robert Francis John Needham, Viscount Newry and Mourne (b. 1966)
*Hon. Andrew Francis Needham (b. 1969)
*Lady Christina Clare Needham (b. 1977)

Although Needham inherited the Earldom of Kilmorey and Viscountcy of Newry and Mourne on the death of his father in 1977, he did not petition the House of Lords to formally claim succession until October 2012. According to his biography he opted not to use the title as he did not inherit any money with it. The Needham estate, known as Mourne Park, is near Kilkeel in County Down in Northern Ireland but the title and estate were separated when the fifth Earl inherited the title but opted to live in England. The Needham estate or Mourne Park is now owned by the Anley family, descendants of the 4th Earl of Kilmorey. The house was badly damaged by fire on 18 May 2013.
