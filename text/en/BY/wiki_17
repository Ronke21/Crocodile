<text>Backbone Mountain is a ridge of the Allegheny Mountains of the central Appalachian Mountain Range. It is situated in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland and forms a portion of the Eastern Continental Divide. Within the state of Maryland, Backbone Mountain reaches an elevation of , making it Maryland&#x27;s highest point.

==Description and geography==
Backbone Mountain stretches approximately southwest to northeast, from the Black Fork near Hambleton in Tucker County, West Virginia to the Savage River Reservoir in Garrett County, Maryland.

The Eastern Continental Divide follows part of the mountain in Maryland. The headwaters of Youghiogheny River, in the watershed of the Mississippi River, lie just northwest of the mountain, whereas the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River lie just south of the mountain, along the West Virginia-Maryland border. In West Virginia, the Eastern Continental Divide diverts to the east, with both sides of the mountain draining into the Black Fork.

The ridge is crossed twice by U.S. Route 219, once north of Parsons and again near Silver Lake. It is also crossed by U.S. Route 50 east of Red House, Maryland, which is marked by a Maryland State Highway Administration sign.

==Notable features==

===Hoye-Crest===

Located just inside of Maryland along Backbone Mountain is Hoye-Crest. At an elevation of , it is the highest point in the state of Maryland. The location, named for Captain Charles Hoye, founder of the Garrett County Historical Society, has a marker and offers a view of the North Branch Potomac River valley to the east. The location is accessible via a path leading from U.S. Route 219 to the west.

===Olson Observation Tower===

The southern end of Backbone Mountain was the location of West Virginia&#x27;s first fire tower. The first tower was built in 1922 by the state and subsequently transferred to Monongahela National Forest. In 1963, the original tower was replaced with the one currently on-site and named after Ernest B. Olson in recognition of 28 years of service in MNF fire control and conservation programs.

While the cab of the tower is not open to the public, the 133 steps leading to it are. From the tower it is possible to view the surrounding area, including Cheat River watershed, Parsons, Blackwater Canyon, Canaan Mountain and the Otter Creek Wilderness.

===Crabtree Woods===
Crabtree Woods, on the northwest slopes of Backbone Mountain, is in the Potomac-Garrett State Forest. It constitutes Maryland&#x27;s largest surviving remnant of old-growth forest: over of mixed Appalachian hardwoods (sugar maple, red oak, basswood and cucumber tree).

<doc id="696749" wikidata="Q1249888" url="?curid=696749" title="Dera Ismail Khan">
<text>Dera Ismail Khan (; Urdu and , ), abbreviated as D.I. Khan, is a city and capital of Dera Ismail Khan District, located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is the 10th largest city of Pakistan and third or fourth largest in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by population. Dera Ismail Khan is situated on the west bank of the Indus River, at its junction with the Gomal River.

It is south of the provincial capital Peshawar, and northwest of Multan, Punjab.

==Etymology==
In the local language, the word &quot;ḍerā&quot; means &quot;tent, encampment&quot;, and is commonly found in the name of towns in the Indus Valley such as Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Bugti. It is named after Dodai mercenary Ismail Khan, son of Malik Sohrab Dodai, who founded the town. As such the name of the city means &quot;Camp of Ismail Khan.&quot;

== History ==
===Foundation===

====Early history====

The region around Dera Ismail Khan has been inhabited for millennia, as evidenced by the nearby site of Rehman Dheri — a pre-Harappan archaeological site dating back from 3300 BCE. In the seventh century, the city had a large population of Brahmins and Buddhists.

====Medieval history====
D. I. Khan is located in the historical Derajat region, which was established in the 15th century, when Baloch people were invited to settle the region by Shah Husayn, of the Langah Sultanate of Multan. 

Baloch settlers were assimilated through the, later waves of Pashtun settlement, although villagers along the alluvial plains are typically Baloch or Jat. 

Dera Ismail Khan region was part of Multan Subah of Mughal Empire, though D. I Khan never attained a station of great power or importance before the British period. D. I. Khan grew prosperous as a trading centre for Powindah nomads, during Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion of the Mughal Empire.

D. I. Khan was ruled by nine generations of Baloch leaders descended directly from Ismail Khan. The last, Nusrat Khan, was removed from power after the city was captured by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1750. In 1794, the city was granted to Nawab Muhammad Khan Sadozai by Shahzada Kamran Durrani.

====Re establishment of the city====
The original town was swept away by flooding on the Indus River in 1823. The present city was founded by Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan of the Saddozai clan in 1825, and now stands four miles (6  km) away from the permanent channel of the river, atop a small plateau. Nawab Sadozai took into consideration the opinions of Diwan Lakhi Mal and Tej Bhan Nandwani for the city&#x27;s reconstruction. Architects were brought in from Punjab, who designed a city where Hindus would live south of the city center and Muslims north of it. 

Four bazaars were laid in each of the cardinal directions, with all four converging in the town&#x27;s central &quot;Chowgalla&quot;. The rebuilt city contained a large bazaar for Afghan traders, and the city prospered from trade via the Gomal Pass. An eight foot mud wall with nine gates was built around the city during this time as well, some of which such as the &quot;Kaneran Wala&quot; and &quot;Sakki&quot; survive until today. All existing buildings date from no earlier than the 19th century.

===Sikh rule (1821–1849)===
D. I. Khan remained under Sadozai rule from the nearby town of Mankera until it was annexed by Bhatti Jatsikh ruler Maharaja Nau Nihal Singh of the Sikh Empire in 1836. Diwan Lakhi Mal appointed city&#x27;s &quot;Kardar&quot; ruler, though the Nawabs of the city from the Durrani order were allowed to maintain their title and some income. The city suffered under punitive taxes that lead to frequent complaints in the Sikh &quot;Darbar&quot; at Lahore, resulting in several changes of &quot;Kardar&quot;.

=== Colonial British India era ===
D. I. Khan&#x27;s first deputy commissioner under British Indian Empire was General Henry Charles Van Cortland, who arrived in February 1848, before departing later that year to quell a revolt in nearby Multan. Following the defeat of rebels at Multan, Lieutenant Butler was made the next deputy commissioner of D. I. Khan and Bannu. Under his rule, city&#x27;s infrastructure and colonial administration system were established in which top posts were exclusively occupied by the British. The city was on the edge of the Tribal Areas — lands that were frequently in rebellion against British Indian Empire. The town did not rise up in revolt against British Indian Empire during the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. In 1861, D. I. Khan was made into the Divisional Capital of the new Dera Ismail Khan Division: analogous to a British county.

The municipality was constituted in 1867, while the Dera Ismail Khan Cantonment was established in 1894. By 1881 the city&#x27;s population was 22,164. The military cantonment area, which lies southeast of the town, had an area of , excluding the portion known as Fort Akalgarh on the northwest side. 

The Dera Ismail Brigade had its winter headquarters at Dera Ismail Khan, and the garrison consisted of a mountain battery, a regiment of Native cavalry, and three regiments of Native infantry. Detachments from these regiments helped to garrison the outposts of Drazinda, Jandola, and Jatta. The &quot;Civil Lines&quot; neighborhood was built to the south.

The town possessed a civil hospital; its chief educational institutions were two aided Anglo-vernacular high schools, one maintained by the Church Missionary Society and the other by the Bharatri Sabha, and an Anglo-vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality.

According to the 1901 census, the population of Dera Ismail Khan was 31,737, of whom 18,662 were Muslims, 11,486 Hindus, and 1,420 Sikhs. Of the total, 3,450 lived in the cantonment. 

The predominantly Muslim population (which accounted for more than 80 % of the local population of Dera Ismail Khan) supported the Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement. After the Partition of India and independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India, while the Muslim migrants from India settled in Dera Ismail Khan. In India, Model Town, Vijay Nagar and Derawal Nagar colony in Delhi absorbed many Hindu former residents of D. I. Khan.

=== After Independence of 1947 ===
Following an influx of refugees following the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, D. I. Khan&#x27;s population tripled. 

During the November 2008 Dera Ismail Khan bombing, Shia religious leader Allama Nazir Hussain Shah was shot dead in a sectarian killing with Shah Iqbal Hussain. During his funeral prayers, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing nine people and injuring 39. In the January 2009 bombings, 52 people were injured while 16 were killed as three explosions took place in the city.

In May 2009, three explosions caused the deaths of five people while nine were injured. On 14 June 2009, eight people were killed while 27 injured in an explosion in Pir Market near a bus stand. On 29 July 2009, two people were killed and four injured when a bomb planted in car detonated near the district court. On May 18, 2010, a bomb planted on a motorcycle exploded near a police van killing 13 people while injuring 14. On 25 June 2011, between 10 and 12 militants of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan attacked a police station in the nearby town of Kulachi, killing 10 police officers. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed the responsibility of these attacks.

In 2014, the wide-scale Operation Zarb-e-Azb was launched against militants throughout Pakistan, which resulted in a greatly improved security environment by 2016, although on January 4, 2017 15 people including five policemen were killed when a remote control planted bomb exploded on Bannu Road. On 17 February 2017, another five people, including four police officers, were killed after unidentified suspects opened fire on a police van near Mission Mor.

As part of the 2015 China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, it was announced that D. I. Khan would be the terminus of the Hakla–Dera Ismail Khan Motorway — a four-lane controlled access motorway, 280 km in length, that is to begin at the M1 near Islamabad and serve as part of the Western Alignment of the economic corridor.

On 3 November 2023, a bomb blast occurred in Dera Ismail Khan, in which a number of people were killed and injured.

<doc id="696757" wikidata="Q4861904" url="?curid=696757" title="Barnsley College">
<text>Barnsley College is a further education college just outside the town centre of Barnsley, England. It has several campuses, including the SciTech Digital Innovation Centre and The Electric Theatre. The college provides A Levels, apprenticeships and vocational courses for students.

Upon its last Ofsted inspection, the college was awarded the grade of &quot;Outstanding&quot;, the highest grade available; further to this award the college was also deemed &quot;The best college in the UK&quot; by Ofsted officials.

== Campus ==
The Old Mill Lane Campus is the main campus building and it has a variety of facilities available to students, including art and design studios, catering kitchens, a simulated nursery and classroom, hair salons, beauty therapy rooms, music recording studios, a drama studio, a dance studio, and a simulated aircraft cabin.

===SciTech Digital Innovation Hub===
Originally opened by Sir Patrick Stewart in November 2004, the SciTech Centre was home to health sciences, social care professions and computing subjects. In 2020, an extensive refurbishment project, supported by the Department for Education and the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, was completed, with the aims of improving facilities and the digital curriculum within Barnsley. The campus was renamed to the SciTech Digital Innovation Hub, and now offers industry-standard, high-spec computing technology to students.

===Honeywell Sports Campus===
The Honeywell Sports Campus offers team sports as well as support for individual athletes. 
All sports courses are delivered on campus, as well as public services.

===Construction Centre===

===Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) Centre===
The STEM Centre offers modern facilities to students including engineering and electrical workshops, laboratory facilities and computer learning zones. The STEM Centre additionally accommodates students studying Health, Science and Social Care Professions courses.

== Lifelong Learning Network ==
Barnsley College is a partner institution of Higher Futures, the Lifelong Learning Networks (LLN) for South Yorkshire, North Derbyshire and North Nottinghamshire.

== History: incorporation ==
The 1990s incorporation of colleges brought radical changes in management style led by David Eade. Franchising on a large scale brought new funds but ultimately in 2001 financial collapse and 100+ staff redundancies (Hansard 21 June 2001: Column 226 Link) as the leadership failed to respond to changes in the funding arrangements (opinion). Stuart Spacey served a prison sentence for fraud as a consequence of actions in this period (Serious Fraud Office press release 19 April 2007 SFO).

== Notable alumni ==
* Joann Fletcher, Egyptologist and TV presenter 
* Matt Helders of the indie rock group Arctic Monkeys studied music
* Stephanie Hirst radio presenter most notably for time at Capital Yorkshire.
* Gary Jarman, bassist of the indie rock group The Cribs studied music there, but failed to finish the course.

<doc id="696758" wikidata="Q2301819" url="?curid=696758" title="Thorpe Park">
<text>Thorpe Park, formerly also known as Thorpe Park Resort, is a theme park located in the village of Thorpe between the towns of Chertsey and Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey, England, southwest of Central London. It is operated by Merlin Entertainments and includes rides, themed cabins, live events and &quot;Hyperia&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s tallest and fastest rollercoaster at over 236ft and 129kmph, it also includes Europe&#x27;s tallest element and the worlds first outer banked airtime hill. In 2019, Thorpe Park was the UK&#x27;s third most visited theme park (1.9 million visitors), behind Alton Towers and Legoland Windsor. However, in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the park only had a 125-day operation season, along with limited capacity, leading to massively reduced visitor numbers.

After demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit, but in the early 1970s part of that gravel pit was flooded, creating a unique water-based environment for the park, with the intention of building a leisure attraction on it. Thorpe Park resort was built on that site in 1979, and being partially flooded it allowed visitors to view Thorpe Park as an island. It has since grown into a major theme park in the UK.
Major attractions include &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;, a large water ride; &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, a dark ride; as well as a number of rollercoasters including &quot;Colossus&quot;, &quot;Nemesis Inferno&quot;, &quot;Stealth&quot;, &quot;Saw – The Ride&quot;, &quot;The Swarm&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead: The Ride&quot;, and &quot;Hyperia&quot;.

==History==

=== Gravel Pit and Water Sports Resort ===
The demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s transformed the grounds into a gravel pit, originally owned by Ready Mixed Concrete Limited. RMC excavated gravel from the site for 30 years from 1941 until 1970 when they began to plan a transformation of the site into a leisure based visitor attraction. Initial concepts planned for the attraction to be themed around the &#x27;History of the British People as a Maritime Nation&#x27; achieved by flooding the now empty gravel pits

In 1975 the Water Ski World Championships were held on the lake. RMC established a subsidiary, Leisure Sport Limited, to operate the park for water sports, leisure and heritage exhibitions, at a cost of £3 million.

The park was formally opened to the public by Lord Louis Mountbatten on 24 May 1979, his final public appearance shortly before he was assassinated by a bomb on board a fishing boat planted by the Provisional IRA in Mullaghmore, Ireland. In addition to lakes and parkland, the park featured a replica Stone Age cave, Celtic farm, Norman castle and Viking camp as well as ancient water vehicles and aircraft.

=== Operation as a theme park ===
In the early 1980s, the park was redeveloped into a theme park with permanent themed rides and attractions. New attractions were opened throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Space Station Zero was the park&#x27;s first rollercoaster, opening in 1984. The last large attraction opened by the park&#x27;s original owners was &quot;X:\No Way Out&quot; in 1996. Both attractions still operate to this day but under the names &#x27;Flying Fish&#x27; and &#x27;The Walking Dead: The Ride&#x27; respectively.

Between 1983 and 1989 the park was often used as a filming location for The Benny Hill Show.

In 1998, The Tussauds Group bought the park. This period saw large investment with major attractions opening such as Tidal Wave in 2000, Colossus in 2002, Nemesis Inferno in 2003 and Stealth in 2006.

In May 2007, Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group for $1.9 billion (USD) and the company was merged into Merlin Entertainments, who took over operation of Thorpe Park. Dubai International Capital also acquired 20% of Merlin Entertainments.

On 17 July 2007, as part of the financing for the Tussauds deal, Merlin sold Thorpe Park to private investment firm Prestbury, under a sale and leaseback agreement. The site is operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease. As of 2023, the site is owned by LXi REIT Plc.

The target audience for the resort is teenagers and young adults, with rides such as &#x27;Saw – The Ride&#x27; in 2009 and &#x27;The Swarm&#x27; in 2011 being added. In 2014, Merlin also decided to target a broader family-based market with new attractions such as Angry Birds Land and the park&#x27;s onsite hotel.

On 20 February 2019, the official Twitter account of Thorpe Park confirmed the permanent closure of Logger&#x27;s Leap, a log flume that had opened in 1989 but had been closed since 2015 due to the Smiler accident at Alton Towers that year.

In 2021, Thorpe Park announced plans for a new rollercoaster in the Old Town section of the park under the project name of Project Exodus. During the 2023 Fright Nights event the name was revealed to be &#x27;Hyperia&#x27; and it was set to be the tallest and fastest rollercoaster in the UK, at a height of 236 feet (71.9 metres) and a speed of 81 mph (130 km per hour).

=== 2024 Revamp ===

In preparation for the opening of Hyperia, Merlin announced major new investment for the older areas of the park to get them up to standard ready for the record breaking new rollercoaster. This began on the 30 October 2023 when Thorpe Park announced that Angry Birds Land would be permanently closing. The park closed for the 2023 season on Tuesday 31 October following the conclusion of that years Fright Nights event. Over the closed season the Sparkle Project began which was a large refurbishment of many areas of the park which saw the refitting of many shops, repaint work for Colossus and Stealth, a new footbridge over Tidal Wave and much more. On 16 November 2023, the park revealed that the Angry Birds Land would be rethemed to Big Easy Boulevard and on the 30 November 2023 Thorpe Park revitalised their branding, with a brand new logo (previously unchanged since 2008) and slogan, bidding farewell to their iconic &quot;infinity&quot; symbol (used for the park since 2001) and light-hearted &quot;An Island Like No Other&quot; tagline - instead marketing itself as the home of &quot;Feel-Good Thrills&quot;. The new logo comes with six palettes and patterns for their marketing materials and merchandise, stating that this “encapsulates the spirit of Thorpe Park”.

The park re-opened for the 2024 season on 24 March with Big Easy Boulevard opening and construction on Hyperia completed. On 27 March 2024, Thorpe Park announced Hyperia&#x27;s opening date of the 24 May 2024. The rollercoaster began testing on 16 April and cycled nearly everyday up until its press event on the 23 May when the first public riders were allowed on.

Hyperia, the UK&#x27;s tallest and fastest rollercoaster opened to the public at the park on the planned date. However, on the morning of 25 May 2024, the park announced on social media that Hyperia would be closed until the 29 May due to &#x27;unforeseen circumstances.&#x27; The re-opening was then delayed until 8 June via another social media post. The final delay to the re-opening date pushed it back to the 12 June where it did re-open successfully. The coaster would go on to valley two times once on 19 June and the 2 October 2024 but has operated reliably since.

== Territories ==
In 2024, with the addition of Big Easy Boulevard and Fearless Valley, Thorpe Park is zoned into nine &#x27;island territories&#x27;. 

* &quot;Port and Basecamp&quot; includes the turnstile entrance, bridge, the dome and the playground.
* &quot;Amity&quot; (originally &#x27;Amity Cove&#x27;) opened with Tidal Wave and now includes &quot;Stealth&quot;, &quot;Depth Charge&quot;, &quot;Amity Beach&quot;, &quot;High Striker&quot;, &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, and &quot;Storm Surge&quot;.
* &quot;The Jungle&quot; contains &quot;Nemesis Inferno&quot;, &quot;Rumba Rapids&quot;, &quot;Mr Monkey&#x27;s Banana Ride&quot;, and a street of restaurants.
* &quot;Old Town&quot; is located towards the back of the park and includes &quot;Saw - The Ride and Samurai&quot;.
* &quot;Fearless Valley&quot; is located towards the back of the park and includes &quot;Hyperia&quot;.
* &quot;Lost City&quot; contains &quot;Colossus&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Quantum&quot;, &quot;Vortex&quot;, and &quot;Zodiac&quot;.
* &quot;Swarm Island&quot; opened as the plaza for &quot;The Swarm&quot;.
* &quot;The Dock Yard&quot; (previously named &#x27;The Depot&#x27; and &#x27;Thorpe Junction&#x27;) is the plaza immediately outside &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, previously known as &quot;Derren Brown&#x27;s Ghost Train&quot;, and includes the nearby &quot;The Walking Dead: The Ride&quot; rollercoaster, previously known as &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X:\ No way out&quot;.
* &quot;Big Easy Boulevard&quot; (formerly &#x27;Angry Birds Land&#x27; between 2014-2023) is located between Amity and The Jungle, and contains &quot;Detonator&quot;, &quot;Big Easy Bumpers&quot; (Dodgems), and &quot;Sunset Cinema&quot; (4D Theatre).

===Port and Basecamp===
The &#x27;Basecamp&#x27; area contains security, the turnstiles, toilets, business/staff reception, &#x27;Island HQ&#x27; and bridge where guests enter the park. This leads to &#x27;The Dome&#x27; which acts as a hub for the park, which houses &#x27;Vibes Bar &amp; Kitchen&#x27; (formerly Infinity Bar &amp; Kitchen), an arcade area, The Coffee Shack, toilets, lockers, the Island Gift Shop, guest services, first aid, photo points and staff areas (canteen, &#x27;The Core&#x27; and offices).

The dome was previously known as &#x27;Port Atlantis&#x27; with an underwater Atlantian themed interior. Much of the scenery and underwater effects went missing since Merlin&#x27;s acquisition of the park and was removed altogether after the building&#x27;s change of theme.

The Dome remains open outside park operating hours to provide entertainment and dining facilities for guests staying at Thorpe Shark Cabins, including a breakfast buffet.

===Amity===
Amity is set as a 1950s-era American fishing village hit by a tidal wave and opened with &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; in 2000. It was previously named &#x27;Amity Cove&#x27;, as still named on themed signage. The area was expanded in 2006 with &quot;Stealth&quot;, set at &#x27;Amity Speedway&#x27; racetrack. It later took on attractions from the former &#x27;Neptune&#x27;s Beach&#x27; family area, &quot;Depth Charge&quot;, and &quot;Amity Beach&quot; outdoor water park. Amity and Amity Speedway are no longer physically connected, being divided by Big Easy Boulevard.

It also includes attractions from the former &#x27;European Park&#x27; area, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; and &quot;Storm In A Teacup&quot;. Flying Fish was originally located beside Tidal Wave (where Stealth sits today) but was removed following construction of Stealth in 2005. It was reopened, in its present location near The Swarm, in 2007, due to popular demand. In 2011, the raft water ride &quot;Storm Surge&quot; was re-located from &quot;Cypress Gardens&quot; in Florida, USA, before it was rethemed into Legoland Florida. Storm Surge was built on the former site of the &quot;Octopus Garden&quot; children&#x27;s area.

=== Calypso Quay ===
The area&#x27;s main attractions are &quot;Nemesis Inferno&quot;, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard inverted coaster set in a volcano, and &quot;Rumba Rapids&quot; a river rapids ride. The area now also includes part of the former &#x27;Ranger County&#x27; family area, including &quot;Mr Monkey&#x27;s Banana Ride&quot;, a small swinging ship ride, as well as shopfronts and restaurants from the former &#x27;European Park&#x27; area.

=== The Dock Yard ===
This area is primarily the plaza for &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, an indoor dark ride, and also contains &quot;The Walking Dead: The Ride&quot; an indoor rollercoaster. The area has no major themed features, other than buildings and scenery remaining from &#x27;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&#x27; (a since-closed children&#x27;s area) which was later themed to Amity such as the Megastore, various buoys, and a carnival game that resembles a cargo ship.

=== Lost City ===
The Lost City&#x27;s theme is that of the ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilisation, with Colossus as the main attraction (since 2002). The area first opened in 2001 with the &quot;Vortex&quot; and &quot;Zodiac&quot; rides as the only attractions. In 2003, this area was expanded further, with the additions of &quot;Quantum&quot; (a magic carpet ride) and &quot;Eclipse&quot; (a Ferris Wheel). &quot;Eclipse&quot; was removed after the 2004 season (being relocated to Chessington World of Adventures); in its place, &quot;Rush&quot;, an S&amp;S Screamin&#x27; Swing, was opened in the 2005 season. At the end of the 2005 season, &quot;Zodiac&quot; was removed, and replaced with a new HUSS Enterprise (relocated from Drayton Manor, where it operated under the name &quot;Cyclone&quot;, until it had to be closed down due to noise complaints). The replacement &quot;Zodiac&quot; opened (without fanfare) for the 2006 season.

=== Old Town ===
The main ride in this area is &quot;Saw - The Ride&quot;, a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with a , 100-degree beyond vertical drop. The ride is themed to the &quot;Saw&quot; horror movie franchise and is set in a derelict warehouse/sawmill. A flat ride called &quot;Samurai&quot; was relocated from Chessington World of Adventures in 2004.

The area was previously named &#x27;Canada Creek&#x27; and was the plaza for Logger&#x27;s Leap, which opened in 1989 as one of the tallest log flumes in the world. It had a loose Canadian forest theme, although this has mostly been lost through redevelopments and resembles more of a Western town theme. The main attractions listed in the area sat outside the plaza. Logger&#x27;s Leap ceased to operate after the 2015 season, and its permanent closure was confirmed in 2019. It also used to have the main station for the &quot;Canada Creek Railway&quot;, a miniature railway which used to take guests to and from the (now closed) &#x27;Thorpe Farm&#x27; area of the park, and around the backwoods of Canada Creek (after the closure of Thorpe Farm, it only traversed the backwoods of the Canada Creek area). The railway was closed during the 2008 season (and the track had to be partially rerouted due to the construction of &quot;SAW - The Ride&quot;), before being closed permanently at the end of the 2011 season. In the years since its closure, the trains, station, and route used by this ride were utilized by several Fright Nights attractions. The area was also home to the experience &quot;Black Mirror Labyrinth&quot; from 2021-2023.

Most of the rides in this area have been closed since the start of the 2022 season, due to construction work for Hyperia (opening 24 May).

=== Fearless Valley ===
The main ride in this area is &quot;Hyperia&quot;, the UK&#x27;s tallest and fastest rollercoaster. Fearless Valley also includes a Burger King, Victorious Games, Hyporium gift shop, Cloud Nine Treats and toilets themed to Hyperia.

=== Swarm Island ===
Swarm Island is the plaza area for &quot;The Swarm&quot;, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard wing coaster, opened in 2012. The area was built on land reclaimed from the surrounding lakes. The area is themed as the scene of an apocalyptic disaster/alien invasion from &quot;The Swarm&quot; which is intertwined with the area and ride station. Major theming pieces include a crashed plane, various damaged emergency vehicles like a helicopter and fire truck, a partially destroyed church (used as the ride station), and other destroyed structures. Many of the areas facilities are based within these structures, such as the ride station being housed in the church, the shop being housed in a shipping container, and the ride control room being based in an overturned police trailer wedged in the roof of the church.

==Records held by the park==

*&quot;Nemesis Inferno&quot; is the first inverted coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews (in the same layout).
* Additionally, the world record for &#x27;most naked people on a rollercoaster&#x27; was set on Nemesis Inferno in May 2004.
*&quot;The Swarm&quot; opened as Europe&#x27;s tallest wing coaster and the first coaster in the world to feature the &quot;wing over drop&quot;.
*&quot;SAW - The Ride&quot; was marketed as having the world&#x27;s steepest &#x27;freefall&#x27; drop, and as the world&#x27;s first horror movie themed roller coaster. &quot;SAW - The Ride&quot; was not actually the steepest rollercoaster in the world when it opened in March 2009 - Steel Hawg at Indiana Beach had opened the previous year with a steeper 111° drop. However, whilst Steel Hawg&#x27;s drop has brakes on it, &quot;SAW&quot;&#x27;s drop is brakeless - hence it being marketed as having the steepest &quot;freefall&quot; drop. This particular accolade was taken by The Monster in 2016 (and, as of 2022, is held by Defiance).
*&quot;Colossus&quot; held the world record for the most inversions on a rollercoaster when it opened in 2002, with 10 inversions. This record was matched in 2006 by &quot;10 Inversion Coaster&quot; (an exact clone of Colossus) and then beaten in 2013 by &quot;The Smiler&quot; at Alton Towers Resort, with 14 inversions.
*&quot;Stealth&quot; was the UK&#x27;s fastest roller coaster, launching from in 1.8 seconds (as of 2024 this record has been taken by Hyperia) Standing at , it is also the UK&#x27;s third tallest roller coaster (behind The Big One and Hyperia&quot;)&quot;. 
*&quot;Tidal Wave&quot; opened as Europe&#x27;s tallest water ride.
*&quot;Hyperia&quot; is the tallest roller coaster in the UK at , and the fastest roller coaster in the UK at 81 mph (130 km/h). &quot;Hyperia&quot; also contains Europe&#x27;s tallest inversion at 168 ft (51.2 m), and a world&#x27;s first outer-banked turn inversion. Thorpe Park also claim that Hyperia has 14.8s of airtime being the UK&#x27;s most weightless coaster. However, this is debated as they have included a 3s stall in this statistic, which is widely regarded as hangtime and not airtime.
*&quot;Stealth&quot; is the world&#x27;s fastest accelerating rollercoaster ( in 1.8 seconds) with the announced closure of Do-Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland on 13 March 2024.

==Fright Nights==

&quot;Fright Nights&quot;, formerly &quot;Fright Nites&quot; is Thorpe Park&#x27;s annual Halloween event and also its largest Halloween event in the UK. It is an event that has been running at Thorpe Park since 2002, celebrating Halloween with the park staying open until late at night, as well as operating a range of temporary Halloween attractions. Roaming actors in costume or with make up can also be found around the park. During Fright Nights, the park stays open until 9pm, with a range of &quot;scare mazes&quot; available for guests, who normally enter in groups of 8–10. &quot;Face it Alone&quot; has sometimes been available as an upcharge, where a guest enters unaccompanied and must sign a disclaimer before entering.

In 2013, Fright Nights was relaunched with a horror movie theme, courtesy of a three-year contract with Lionsgate. All of the pre-existing Fright Nights attractions were removed with the exception of The Asylum and SAW: Alive to make way for new horror-film themed attractions.

In 2014, when the Thorpe Shark Hotel opened, Thorpe Park offered two overnight scare attractions, one of which involved a &#x27;night terror&#x27; character appearing in guests&#x27; hotel rooms during the night. The other attraction, the &#x27;Extra Cut&#x27;, involved guests being &#x27;kidnapped&#x27; from their hotel room during the night and chased throughout the park.

In 2017 Fright Nights was reinvented with a Walking Dead theme. The addition of two Walking Dead attractions coincided with the season 8 premier of the show. SAW Alive, The Big Top and Platform 15 remained in operation from previous years, with Containment returning as an upcharge attraction.

In 2020, restrictions put into place due to the COVID-19 Pandemic meant that only two mazes operated: Platform 15 and Roots of Evil, both of which took place primarily outdoors. This led to a wide selection of scare zones introduced for the first time to Fright Nights, with The Swarm: Invasion located on Swarm Island, Creek Freaks Unchained in Old Town, The Fearstival Arena in The Dockyard, The Howling of LycanThorpe High in Lost City (on the site near Zodiac and Rush typically used for a scare maze), and Terror at Amity High returning for its third year on the Stealth Plaza. The Crows were also added as roaming actors dressed as scarecrows, based in a few main locations but found anywhere around the park, including interacting with other scare zones.

==Thorpe Shark Cabins==

Guests can stay over on-park at the &#x27;Thorpe Shark Cabins&#x27;, comprising 90 rooms converted from shipping containers with a link to facilities in the adjacent Dome. The accommodation takes its name from its shark head entrance feature built from recycled park signage.

The hotel initially opened in 2013 as &#x27;The Crash Pad&#x27;, run by external company Snoozebox. The temporary development was purchased by the park the following year and rebranded as the Thorpe Shark Hotel.

Thorpe Park had originally been planning to build a permanent 250-bed hotel as far back as 2006. This would have been located on the opposite side of the lake, on the site of former excavation works, featuring a lakeside bar, health club and restaurant. Planning permission was granted in 2011.

The development was pitched again following the installation of &#x27;The Crash Pad&#x27; to &quot;test market conditions&quot;. The park received planning permission to construct the permanent hotel in 2014, with construction planned to begin in 2016 and an opening in 2018. However, the hotel was never constructed and the Shark Hotel&#x27;s planning permission was extended by 10 years instead.

In 2023, new Swarm, Nemesis Inferno and Stealth themed rooms opened in the Thorpe Shark Cabins. They feature special theming in the room and unlimited fastrack on each rooms roller coaster on your 2nd day.

In 2024, new Colossus and Hyperia themed rooms opened in the Thorpe Shark Cabins.

== Operations and developments ==
Thorpe Park has a maximum capacity of 15,000 guests.

In 2010, the park outlined a 5-year development plan that outlined new rollercoasters for 2012, which was later realised in The Swarm. The plan outlined another rollercoaster scheduled for 2015 as well as a permanent lakeside hotel, both of which have not come to fruition. No application was ever submitted for the 2015 development and the earmarked site behind The Swarm remains undeveloped.

On 26 November 2021, the park launched a public consultation website outlining a proposal for a brand new roller coaster. Alongside this, leaflets were handed out to local residents, stating the proposal will &#x27;involve the removal of existing old rides and replacement with a new roller coaster in the Old Town part of the resort&#x27;. The public consultation began on 10 December 2021, with plans detailing a tall steel hyper coaster codenamed &quot;Project Exodus&quot;. 

An application for planning permission was submitted on 14 March 2022. Objections were raised by Surrey Wildlife Trust, Natural England, and the Environment Agency; citing concerns regarding biodiversity impacts, pollution, and flood risks. The concerns raised by Surrey Wildlife Trust and Natural England were addressed, leading to their objections subsequently being withdrawn. On 5 October 2022, Runnymede Borough Council approved the application for &quot;Project Exodus&quot;, but, due to the unresolved objection from the Environment Agency, the application had to be referred to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities for approval (under the terms of The Town and Country Planning (Consultation) (England) Direction 2021).

On 1 November 2022, a letter sent to Runnymede Borough Council on behalf of the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities stated that &#x27;He is content that it should be determined by the local planning authority&#x27;. Subsequently, Runnymede Borough Council granted planning permission for &quot;Project Exodus&quot; on 2 November 2022.

Construction for the project began in January 2023, with the manufacturer being confirmed as Mack Rides. On 17 July 2023, the first supports arrived for the coaster. In August 2023, Project Exodus was confirmed to be the UK&#x27;s fastest roller coaster and the colour scheme of black, gold and white was confirmed. 

On 5 October 2023, the name for Project Exodus, Hyperia, was revealed and, on 6 March 2024, the track was completed. The rollercoaster opened on 24 May 2024, but was closed the following day. It reopened on 12 June 2024, but was temporarily closed again on 19 June following an incident four days earlier, in which riders were stuck on part of the ride for an hour.

== Transport ==
There are no direct rail connections to Thorpe Park; the nearest railway station is Chertsey, 2 km away.

<text>The Simla Agreement, also spelled Shimla Agreement, was a peace treaty signed between India and Pakistan on 2 July 1972 in Shimla, the capital city of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It followed the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which began after India intervened in East Pakistan as an ally of Mukti Bahini who were fighting against Pakistani state forces in the Bangladesh Liberation War. The Indian intervention proved decisive in the war and led to East Pakistan&#x27;s breakaway from its union with West Pakistan and the emergence of the independent state of Bangladesh.

The treaty&#x27;s official purpose was stated to serve as a way for both countries to &quot;put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations&quot; and to conceive the steps to be taken for further normalization of India–Pakistan relations while also laying down the principles that should govern their future interactions.

The treaty also gave back more than 13,000 km2 of land that the Indian Army had seized in Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few strategic areas, including Turtuk, Dhothang, Tyakshi (earlier called Tiaqsi) and Chalunka of Chorbat Valley, which was more than 883 km2.

== Details ==
The treaty was signed in Simla (also spelt &quot;Shimla&quot;) in India by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the President of Pakistan, and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. The agreement also paved the way for diplomatic recognition of Bangladesh by Pakistan. Technically, the document was signed at 0040 hours in the night of 3 July; despite this official documents are dated 2 July 1972. Some of the major outcomes of the Simla Agreement are:
* Both countries will &quot;settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations&quot;. India has, many a times, maintained that Kashmir dispute is a bilateral issue and must be settled through bilateral negotiations as per Simla Agreement, 1972 and thus, had denied any third party intervention even that of United Nations.
* The agreement converted the cease-fire line of 17 December 1971 into the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan and it was agreed that &quot;neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations&quot;. Many Indian bureaucrats have later argued that a tacit agreement, to convert this LOC into international border, was reached during a one-on-one meeting between the two heads of government. Pakistani bureaucrats have denied any such thing. This identification of a new &quot;cease-fire line&quot; by both the states has been argued by India as making United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan insignificant. As according to India, the purpose of UNMOGIP was to monitor the cease-fire line as identified in Karachi agreement of 1949 which no longer exists. Pakistan has a different take on this issue and both countries still host the UN mission.

The agreement has not prevented the relationship between the two countries from deteriorating to the point of armed conflict, most recently in the Kargil War of 1999. In Operation Meghdoot of 1984 India seized all of the inhospitable Siachen Glacier region where the frontier had been clearly not defined in the agreement (possibly as the area was thought too barren to be controversial); this was considered as a violation of the Simla Agreement by Pakistan. Most of the subsequent deaths in the Siachen Conflict have been from natural disasters, e.g. avalanches in 2010, 2012, and 2016.

==Delhi Agreement ==

The Delhi Agreement on the Repatriation of War and Civilian Internees is a tripartite agreement among the aforementioned states, signed on 28 August 1973. The agreement was signed by Kamal Hossain, the Foreign Minister of the Government of Bangladesh, Sardar Swaran Singh, Minister of External Affairs of India and Aziz Ahmed, the Minister of State for Defense and Foreign Affairs of the Government of Pakistan.

<text>William Julius &quot;Judy&quot; Johnson (October 26, 1899 – June 15, 1989) was an American professional baseball third baseman, shortstop, manager and scout whose career in Negro league baseball spanned 17 seasons, from 1921 to 1937. He also played in the Cuban League. Slight of build, Johnson never developed as a power threat but achieved his greatest success as a contact hitter and an intuitive defenseman. Johnson is regarded as one of the greatest third basemen of the Negro leagues. In 1975, he was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame after being nominated by the Negro Leagues Committee.

From 1921 to 1929, Johnson was a member of the Hilldale Daisies ball club and became an on-the-field leader respected for his professional disposition. His consistent swing and fielding prowess helped the Daisies win three straight pennants in the Eastern Colored League and the 1925 Colored World Series. After serving as a player-manager for the Homestead Grays followed by the Daisies in the early 1930s, Johnson signed with the Pittsburgh Crawfords; as a part of the vaunted Crawford line-up of 1935, Johnson contributed to a team widely considered the greatest in Negro league history. He retired in 1937 after a short second stint with the Grays.

Following his retirement from baseball as a player, Johnson became a scout for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. He was hired as an assistant coach by the Philadelphia Athletics in 1954, becoming one of the first African Americans signed to a coaching position on a major league ball club. In his later years, Johnson served on the Negro Leagues Committee and stepped down in 1975 to accept his hall of fame nomination. He suffered a stroke in 1988 and died a year later.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===

William Julius Johnson was born on October 26, 1899, in Snow Hill, Maryland, to William Henry Johnson, a sailor and licensed boxing coach, and Annie Lee Johnson. Johnson had an older sister Mary Emma and a younger brother John, both of whom were named after heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson, a long-time friend of William Henry. Early into his childhood, the family moved to Wilmington, Delaware; by that time his father worked at the docks as a shipbuilder and as the athletic director at the Negro Settlement House.

When Johnson was eight years old, his father began grooming him to become a pugilist. William Henry bought two pairs of boxing gloves: one pair for his son and the other for Mary Emma, his sparring partner. The sport was unappealing to Johnson, however; instead, he began playing sandlot ball and joined his father&#x27;s local amateur team the Rosedale Blues which competed against black and white teams. In 1917, he stopped attending Howard High School to work on shipyards in New Jersey and play weekend games on baseball teams that were drawn from the community, including the Rosalies and the Chester Stars. The following year he joined the semi-professional ball club the Bacharach Giants for a $5 wage per game.

=== The Hilldale Daisies (1921–1929) ===
In early 1919, Johnson worked out for the Hilldale Daisies and was attached with the Madison Stars, Hilldale&#x27;s unofficial minor league affiliate, to hone his skills. By 1921, with the Daisies in need of an infielder, Johnson signed a professional baseball contract worth $135 a month with Ed Bolden, who owned the Hilldale ball club. The rookie ballplayer was soon adorned with the nickname &quot;Judy&quot; because of his resemblance to Chicago American Giants pitcher Judy Gans; the name stuck with Johnson for the duration of his baseball career. Johnson spent his first year as a professional ballplayer at shortstop while his player manager Bill Francis played at third base, Johnson&#x27;s natural position. Once the regular season began, Johnson struggled at the plate, finishing his rookie year with a .188 batting average (BA), yet he played every day and was mentored by Francis in the offseason in order to make the transition to third base.

During the 1922 season, Johnson was used as the starting third baseman. With Francis leaving for the Bacharach Giants, Johnson looked to John Henry Lloyd for guidance. A renowned infielder, the veteran ballplayer became a role model to him, and Johnson&#x27;s defensive style closely resembled his mentor&#x27;s. After his playing career, Johnson stated, &quot;He&#x27;s [Lloyd] the man I give the credit to for polishing my skills; he taught me how to play third base and how to protect myself... John taught me more baseball than anyone else&quot;. In the offseason, the Hilldale club joined Bolden&#x27;s newly established Eastern Colored League (ECL). Bolden had rebuilt the team as well, strengthening its core with the signings of Biz Mackey and George &quot;Tank&quot; Carr, both from the American Giants.

The 1923 campaign was the beginning of a series of successful seasons for Johnson which saw his emergence as a hitter and leader of the Daisies. Measured at 5-feet-11 inches and 155 lbs. (70.3 kg.), Johnson never developed as a serious power threat; instead, he became a player who consistently hit for contact and drove the ball at gaps in the defense. A &quot;scientific hitter&quot; at the plate, as sports historian Richard Bak described him, Johnson used different strategies to get on base such as taking walks or crowding in on the plate to allow the ball to hit his sleeve. In the field, Johnson was the defensive leader of the Daisies&#x27; infield, noted for his intuitive fielding prowess and strong throwing arm. The Daisies won their first Eastern Colored League pennant with Johnson as their most consistent player at the plate; he batted .391 in 1923.

The Hilldale club had another successful season in 1924, clinching their second pennant. The Daisies had high expectations when they met the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League (NNL) in the 1924 Colored World Series, the first official World Series between the respective champions of the NNL and ECL. Johnson led both teams with a .364 BA and hit a clutch Inside-the-park home run in Game Five of the best-of-nine series, but the Daisies lost, five games to four (with one tied game). The following season, with Johnson hitting .392, the Daisies secured a third straight pennant and returned to the World Series for a rematch with the Monarchs. The favored Hilldale club owed its success in the series—which they won five-to-one—to a stronger line-up consisting of seven starters finishing the regular season batting over .300 and pitching staff led by Nip Winters.

After the season, Johnson started playing winter ball in Cuba and was moved to the clean-up spot in the line-up for the remainder of his stint with Hilldale. The Daisies finished second in the ECL pennant race of 1926 to the Bacharach Giants. During the playoffs, the Daisies played four exhibition games against a team composed of white major leaguers, including Lefty Grove, Heinie Manush, and Jimmy Dykes. Hilldale bested them in three out of the four games; Johnson made more money from the games than if the team had played in the World Series.

=== The 1930s ===
The onset of the Great Depression in the United States drastically affected attendance at Negro league baseball games, forcing the Daisies to temporarily fold before the 1930 season. At 29 years old, Johnson signed on with the Homestead Grays as a player manager. During the season, Johnson directed his attention to Crawford Colored Giants catcher Josh Gibson who was mentioned in several newspapers for his ability to hit long home runs. The Grays, however, did not seriously pursue Gibson—the team already had two catchers, Buck Ewing and Vic Harris, on its roster. On July 25, 1930, the Grays played an exhibition game with the Monarchs; scheduled at night, the field was illuminated by Monarchs owner J. L. Wilkinson&#x27;s portable lighting system to attract fans. Ewing, the starting catcher, lost sight of the ball in the low visibility and was injured by a pitch as Harris was playing in the outfield. In attendance, Gibson was called from the stands by Johnson to catch for the remainder of the game. He finished the season with the Grays; Johnson, his mentor, used him to catch batting practice every day and gradually worked him into the line-up.

Johnson spent the 1931 and early 1932 seasons managing the Daisies which joined the East–West League for the latter year. Although he was in the twilight of his playing career, Johnson still felt he could contribute to a winning team and signed on with the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1932. The 1932 Crawfords team is considered one of the greatest squads ever assembled, often receiving comparisons to the New York Yankees&#x27; 1927 team known as the Murderers&#x27; Row. Their owner, the wealthy businessman Gus Greenlee, had little experience with baseball when he purchased the Crawfords in 1930 but was determined to aggressively purchase and trade for the best available players. By 1932, Greenlee signed five future hall of famers: Johnson, Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, and Oscar Charleston, the player manager.

Like Charleston, Johnson remained productive in the latter stage of his career, hitting well above a .300 BA during his five-year stint with the Crawfords. In 1935, he was chosen as captain, and the Crawfords were favored to win the pennant race. The team secured the first half of the championship but finished second in the latter half to the Cuban Giants. As a tiebreaker, both clubs met for a seven-game series to determine the winner of the pennant. In Game Seven, with the Crawfords trailing 7–4 and down to their final out, Johnson hit an infield single to load the bases and kept Pittsburgh&#x27;s pennant hopes alive. Charleston followed next in the order and hit a walk-off grand slam to win the game and the series.

Although the Crawfords finished the second half of 1936 in first place and Johnson showed little signs of slowing down with age, Greenlee shockingly traded him and Gibson to the Homestead Grays in exchange for Pepper Bassett and Henry Spearman, both of whom were considered marginal players at best. Johnson took the deal personally; he played for a few games at the beginning of the 1937 season and announced his retirement soon after.

=== Later life and legacy ===

After he retired from baseball, Johnson worked for the Continental Cab Company and managed a general goods store with his brother. In 1951, the Philadelphia Athletics hired Johnson as a scout. He urged the team, albeit unsuccessfully, to sign prospects Hank Aaron and Minnie Minoso. Before the Athletics relocated to Kansas in 1954, the club assigned Johnson as an assistant coach tasked with instructing black players Bob Trice and Vic Power during spring training. Due to the brief nature of Johnson&#x27;s assignment, Buck O&#x27;Neil is generally credited with being the first African-American to coach in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Johnson spent time scouting with the Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1950s and 1960s. He is credited with instigating the signings of slugger Dick Allen and Bill Bruton who later became his son-in-law. As one of the oldest surviving stars of the Negro leagues, Johnson was offered a seat on the Committee on Negro Baseball Leagues when it was appointed by MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn in 1971. The Committee&#x27;s responsibility was to select noteworthy Negro league players for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1975, Johnson stepped down from his position in the Committee to accept his Baseball Hall of Fame nomination. 

In 1976, Johnson was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame.

Johnson is recognized as the best third baseman of the Negro leagues; Arthur Ashe in his book &quot; A Hard Road to Glory&quot; termed his play as &quot;the standard by which other third-basemen were measured&quot;. His leadership was the centerpiece of two of the most dominant Negro league teams—the Hilldale Daisies in the 1920s and the Pittsburgh Crawfords in the 1930s. Former teammates, including Ted Page and Johnson&#x27;s mentor John Henry “Pop” Lloyd, praised his composure under pressure, both on the field and at the plate. Johnson suffered a stroke in 1988 and died a year later on June 15, 1989, in Wilmington; he was 89 years old. His home, the William Julius &quot;Judy&quot; Johnson House in Marshallton, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Judy Johnson Field at Daniel S. Frawley Stadium is named for him.

In 2019, a memorial statue dedicated to Johnson was unveiled in his home town of Snow Hill, Maryland, in front of the town&#x27;s library.

<doc id="696766" wikidata="Q2275150" url="?curid=696766" title="Seven Oaks Dam">
<text>Seven Oaks Dam is a high earth and rock fill embankment dam across the Santa Ana River in the San Bernardino Mountains, about northeast of Redlands in San Bernardino County, southern California. It impounds Seven Oaks Reservoir in the San Bernardino National Forest.

The dam was proposed in response to major floods in the mid–20th century, and was constructed between 1993 and 2000. Seven Oaks is a dry dam that serves mainly for flood protection to Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, although it also used to impound water for groundwater recharge. One of the largest embankment dams in the United States, the dam was built under contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) by Odebrecht Corporation of California, a subsidiary of the Brazilian firm Contructora Norberto Odebrecht. The dam is now owned and operated by local flood control districts.

==History==
The USACE began an ambitious effort to improve levees and dams on the Santa Ana River system known as the Santa Ana River Mainstem Project. Among the works proposed under the project were an expansion of the massive Prado Dam, which despite filling to capacity did not fully prevent heavy flooding damages in Orange County, and the construction of the $530 million &quot;Mentone Dam&quot; across the Santa Ana north of Mentone in San Bernardino County. However, the Mentone Dam site was controversial because it would affect groundwater recharge, was aesthetically unpleasing and lay on unstable sediment deposits directly above the San Andreas Fault. In response to public opposition, the USACE replaced the Mentone proposal with the $304 million Upper Santa Ana River Dam, later to be called Seven Oaks Dam, in a bedrock canyon one mile (1.6 km) upstream in the southern San Bernardino Mountains.
The contract for Seven Oaks Dam was awarded in 1994 and construction work began in May. A system of conveyor belts totaling , with a capacity of 3,400 short tons (3,080 t) per hour, was built to transport materials to the dam site. Fill used in the embankment was excavated from the Santa Ana River canyon directly below the dam, the alluvial fan of the river north of Mentone, and a cut in a ridge directly southeast of the dam that now serves as the dam&#x27;s spillway. The dam was built in ten alternating zones of dirt, rock and clay that ultimately totaled . When completed and dedicated in January 2000, the Seven Oaks Dam was the 12th highest dam in the world and was one of the last major dams built in the United States. At $450 million, the final cost of the dam significantly exceeded the USACE&#x27;s projected cost. The federal government shouldered 70.47% of the total cost, while Orange County paid 27.09%, San Bernardino County 1.71%, and Riverside County 0.73%.

==Design and operations==
Seven Oaks Dam is a long arched embankment structure standing high above the Santa Ana River and above its deepest foundations. The dam is wide at the crest and over wide at the base. Situated close to the San Andreas Fault, Seven Oaks is designed to withstand an 8.0 ML earthquake. The reservoir has a gross storage capacity of , with reserved for flood control and the remainder for sediment accumulation. At full pool, the reservoir lies at an elevation of and has an area of . Water releases are controlled by a long tunnel outlet that runs through the base of the structure, and a wide ungated overflow spillway located just southeast of the dam. The dam controls runoff from an area of or including the drainage area of Baldwin Lake, which overflows into the Santa Ana River system during periods of heavy runoff.
In tandem with Prado Dam, Seven Oaks prevents about $140 million of flood–related damages each year in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties and provides flood protection to more than two million people. During flood events, Seven Oaks Dam will store runoff as long as the reservoir of Prado Dam is rising, then release the captured water as quickly as downstream channel conditions allow. Seven Oaks is designed to completely contain a &quot;Reservoir Design Flood&quot; of , corresponding to a 350-year flood event, reducing it to a peak outflow of . The dam is capable of withstanding an inflow of up to , or the &quot;Probable Maximum Flood&quot;. In addition, controlled releases from the dam allow about of additional groundwater recharge in the upper Santa Ana River basin each year. Captured floodwater from the Seven Oaks Dam benefits local water districts, as river water costs only a fraction of water imported through the State Water Project, which supplies most agricultural and municipal needs in the area.

Since its construction, Seven Oaks Dam has not yet been filled to capacity. The highest lake level on record was about , or less than a third of capacity, on March 8, 2005. The high water presented an opportunity to test large water releases through the dam&#x27;s outlet works, but the trial had to be cancelled because the high flows destroyed sections of the concrete tunnel lining. The tunnel was repaired and later tested successfully in 2011.

==Environmental impacts==
In March 1999, as the dam neared completion, environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the USACE because construction activity at the Seven Oaks site had affected the habitats of two endangered plants, the Santa Ana River woolly star and slender-horned spineflower, and the endangered San Bernardino kangaroo rat. The USACE responded by purchasing of land adjoining the dam and reservoir to use in conservation of these species. The Seven Oaks Dam has also damaged the habitat of native fish species including the Santa Ana sucker, which is endemic to a handful of river systems of Southern California.

<doc id="696768" wikidata="Q1344607" url="?curid=696768" title="Mairé-Levescault">
<text>Mairé-Levescaultt is a commune in the Deux-Sèvres department in western France. (Not to be confused with Mairé, in the same general area).

==History==
The history and derivation of the name of Mairé-L&#x27;Evescault are closely linked to that of Saint Junian (&quot;Junien&quot;), the patron saint of Poitou ploughmen. He was born in the year AD 500 or AD 501 in the area of &quot;Briosso&quot; (now called Briançais) on an estate named &quot;Champagné&quot; which still exists close to the village of Mairé in the commune of Perigné, Deux-Sèvres, and was educated by his parents who were Gallo-Roman nobility.

Although his name is undoubtedly of Pagan origin, coming from the Roman gods Juno/Jupiter, he was dedicated to the service of God from his earliest childhood and was instructed in all the sacred and human sciences which were taught at that time.

Nothing else is known about his early life but we re-encounter Junien as a young man living as a hermit in a place called Bois Trappeau in the commune of Ardilleux in Deux-Sèvres.

In 559, King Clotaire I made him a gift of land on which to found a monastery dedicated to the rule of Saint Benoît. This isolated place evoked memories of his childhood home and Junien named it &quot;Mariacus&quot; - subsequently &quot;Mairé&quot;. The &quot;L&#x27;Evescault&quot; was added after a great religious festival in Poitiers to which Junien was invited by Queen Radagonde who raised him to the same rank as the other bishops or &quot;Les Evêques&quot; who were present. Hence the name Mairé-L&#x27;Evescault.

The monastery was partially destroyed during the wars of Pepin the Short and Charlemagne but survived for another thousand years. It was finally demolished during the French Revolution, the stone being re-used for local construction and the lands reverting to their farming origins.

<text>Abraham Louis Fischer (23 April 19088 May 1975) was a South African Communist lawyer of Afrikaner descent with partial Anglo-African ancestry from his paternal grandmother, notable for anti-apartheid activism and for the legal defence of anti-apartheid figures, including Nelson Mandela, at the Rivonia Trial. Following the trial, he was himself put on trial accused of furthering communism. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and diagnosed with cancer while in prison. The South African Prisons Act was extended to include his brother&#x27;s house in Bloemfontein where he died two months later.

== Family and education ==

Fischer came from a prominent Afrikaner family; his father was Percy Fischer (1878–1957), a judge president of the Orange Free State and his grandfather was Abraham Fischer (1850–1913), a prime minister of the Orange River Colony and later a member of the cabinet of the unified South Africa.

Prior to studying at University of Oxford (New College) as a Rhodes scholar during the 1930s, he was schooled at Grey College and Grey University College in Bloemfontein, he was a resident of House Abraham Fischer which is named after his grandfather Abraham Fischer. During his stay at Oxford, he travelled on the European continent, including a trip in 1932 to the Soviet Union. In a letter to his parents during his trip indicating that he had become radicalized, he noted similarities between the position of Russian farmers that he encountered along the Volga river and South African blacks.

In 1937, Fischer married Molly Krige, a niece of Jan Smuts; the couple had three children. Their son, Paul died of cystic fibrosis at the age of 23 while Fischer was in prison. Molly became involved in politics and was detained without trial during the 1960 state of emergency declared after the Sharpeville massacre. In 1964, Bram, Molly and a friend, Liz Franklin, were driving to Cape Town for daughter Ilse&#x27;s 21st birthday. Bram swerved the car to avoid hitting a cow that had strayed onto the road. The car veered off the road and overturned into a river, causing Molly to drown.

== Professional and political activities ==

Fischer joined the Communist Party of South Africa (SACP) in the 1940s and soon rose to leadership positions. The CPSA had a close relationship with the African National Congress (ANC) and in 1943, Fischer co-authored revisions to the constitution of the ANC. In 1946 he was charged with incitement arising out of his position as a leader of the CPSA and the African Mine Workers&#x27; Strike of that year. After the CPSA was dissolved and banned in 1950, he became Chairman of the illegal South African Communist Party when it was established underground in 1953.

Alongside Issy Maisels and others, Fischer played an integral role on the defense team in the Treason Trial of 1956 – 1961 where Mandela and many other anti-apartheid activists were acquitted on 29 March 1961. In his autobiography, Mandela affectionately recalls Fischer reading the left wing publication &quot;New Age&quot; at his table during the trial proceedings.

Fischer led Nelson Mandela&#x27;s legal defence team at the Rivonia Trial of 1963 – 1964. By a coincidence, Fischer had not been present at the raid on Liliesleaf Farm, although he had in fact been part of the trusted Rivonia inner circle. A number of documents seized by authorities were in his handwriting.

Mandela and co-defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty, which the state prosecutor Percy Yutar had been asking for. This was considered a victory for the defence. International pressure also played a role. At this time, Fischer&#x27;s role as leader of the SACP was unknown even to his closest white friends.

After the verdict, Bram Fischer visited the Rivonia trial prisoners on Robben Island to discuss the question of an appeal in their case. Wishing to protect the prisoners, he did not tell them of his wife’s death one week earlier. After the meeting, Mandela learned about Mrs. Fischer&#x27;s death and wrote to Fischer, a letter that his prison guards never delivered. A few days later Fischer was himself arrested, held in solitary confinement for three days and then released. On 23 September 1964, he was again arrested and joined the 12 white men and women facing charges of being members of the illegal South African Communist Party.

Fischer was released on bail to handle a patent case in London. He applied for bail to attend to his case. In his appeal to Court in the bail application he stated:

I am an Afrikaner. My home is in South Africa. I will not leave my country because my political beliefs conflict with those of the Government.

Fischer returned to South Africa to face trial despite pressure put on him to forgo his £5,000 bail and go into exile. One day, after proceedings began, he did not arrive at Court and instead sent a letter to his counsel, Harold Hanson which was read out in court. He wrote:

By the time this reaches you I shall be a long way from Johannesburg and shall absent myself from the remainder of the trial. But I shall still be in the country to which I said I would return when I was granted bail. I wish you to inform the Court that my absence, though deliberate, is not intended in any way to be disrespectful. Nor is it prompted by any fear of the punishment which might be inflicted on me. Indeed I realise fully that my eventual punishment may be increased by my present conduct...

My decision was made only because I believe that it is the duty of every true opponent of this Government to remain in this country and to oppose its monstrous policy of apartheid with every means in his power. That is what I shall do for as long as I can...

What is needed is for White South Africans to shake themselves out of their complacency, a complacency intensified by the present economic boom built upon racial discrimination. Unless this whole intolerable system is changed radically and rapidly, disaster must follow. Appalling bloodshed and civil war will become inevitable because, as long as there is oppression of a majority, such oppression will be fought with increasing hatred.

Fischer went underground to support the liberation struggle against apartheid. In doing so, he went against the advice of Mandela, who had advised him to support the struggle in the courtroom, &quot;where people could see this Afrikaner son of a judge president fighting for the rights of the powerless. But he could not let others suffer while he remained free. […] Bram did not want to ask others to make a sacrifice that he was unwilling to make himself.&quot;

Fischer was struck off the advocate&#x27;s roll in 1965 in a trial completed in his absence. Advocates Harold Hanson, Sydney Kentridge, and Arthur Chaskalson defended him at the hearing. Vernon Berrange led the defence case and Ismail Mahomed (who later became Chief Justice in the new South Africa) and Denis Kuny acted as Junior Counsel.

== Imprisonment and death ==

Fischer carried on underground activities for almost a year. He was arrested in November 1965, nine months after his return to South Africa and after 290 days underground. In March 1966 he was put on trial for a second time on charges of furthering the aims of communism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. He was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was imprisoned in Pretoria Central Prison.
In 1974 Denis Goldberg and another prisoner, Marius Schoon, became concerned about Fischer’s health; his hip was giving him pain, his digestion was poor and he looked gaunt and frail. Suspecting that Fischer would not receive the proper care he needed, Goldberg kept a detailed diary of Fischer’s medical care which was subsequently smuggled out of prison. Fischer needed a crutch to walk but a request for one was denied; a broom was found and used instead. In September 1974 he fell and fractured his femur and neck whilst trying to shower, after which it took thirteen days before he was admitted to hospital. When he returned from the hospital Fischer was in a wheelchair, disorientated and unable to look after himself. The hip was found to be cancerous. Goldberg argued, and was eventually allowed, to spend the nights with Fischer in his cell where he tried to make him comfortable. By this time Fischer was so emaciated that Goldberg could easily carry him to the toilet pot.

It was not until December of that year that the authorities had him transferred to a hospital. When news of his illness was publicised, the public lobbied government for his release.

Non-political prisoners rarely served their full term and would be released after serving half or two-thirds of their sentence, but political prisoners were required to serve every day of their sentence. Fischer was allowed to leave the prison shortly before his death and placed under house arrest at his brother&#x27;s home in Bloemfontein in April 1975. He died a few weeks later.

The prisons department had Fischer&#x27;s ashes returned to them after the funeral and they have never been located. Anti-apartheid political leaders in Parliament Colin Eglin and Harry Schwarz both called for Fischer&#x27;s remains to be returned to his family, which was refused.

== Tributes and legacy ==

Nelson Mandela wrote in his 1995 autobiography, Fischer was one of the &quot;bravest and staunchest friends of the freedom struggle that I have ever known.&quot; From a prominent Afrikaner family, he gave up a life of privilege, rejected his heritage, and was ostracized by his own people, showing &quot;a level of courage and sacrifice that was in a class by itself.&quot;

Fischer had been reluctant to serve as leader of the defence at the Rivonia Trial, since many of the witnesses could implicate him in illegal communist activities. In addition, his handwriting was found on documents from Liliesleaf Farm. His white friends could not understand his reluctance and persuaded him to do so, not knowing his Communist Party membership. As a result, when Lionel Bernstein heard about it, he remarked that &quot;He deserves the Victoria Cross&quot;.

In her account of her detention and solitary confinement by the South African Security Branch in 1963, Ruth First writes about being questioned about Fischer, telling her interrogators, &quot;Bram is a friend, a very dear friend of mine, a wonderful man, and – thank God for the reputation of your people that you have at least one saving grace – he&#x27;s an Afrikaner.&quot;

Fischer was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize, in 1967.

He was respected by fellow prisoners in Pretoria Central, and even earned the respect of prison warden Vermeulen, who at his trial following suspected involvement in the prison escape involving Tim Jenkin and others in 1979, called him the nicest prisoner he&#x27;d guarded, saying &quot;Fischer was very keen on rugby. We used to talk about it a lot. I felt sorry when he died. He was a gentleman. He was the leader of the prisoners.&quot;

One of the first major post apartheid housing projects in Johannesburg was named Bram Fischerville in his honour. It is located north of Soweto, has 22000 formal houses and was settled from 1997 onwards.

In &quot;Country of My Skull&quot; (1998), Antjie Krog wrote, &quot;He was so much braver than the rest of us, he paid so much more, his life seems to have touched the lives of so many people – even after his death&quot;.

In 2003 Fischer became the first South African ever to be posthumously reinstated to the Bar.

In 2004, despite opposition from alumni and management, Fischer was awarded a posthumous honorary degree by Stellenbosch University.

Rhodes House (University of Oxford), where Fischer was a student, has held an annual Bram Fischer Memorial Lecture to honour his legacy since 2007, a reincarnation of a former lecture in his name hosted by New College.

In December 2012, Bloemfontein Airport was renamed Bram Fischer International Airport.

== Works about Fischer ==
An early biography was written in Bram Fischer&#x27;s lifetime by Naomi Michison, &quot;A Life for Africa: The Story of Bram Fischer (1973)&quot;.

&quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1979), a novel by literature Nobel Prize winner and fellow South African, Nadine Gordimer, is based on the life of Bram Fischer&#x27;s daughter; he is the &quot;Burger&quot; of the title.

Fischer is also the subject of Stephen Clingman&#x27;s &quot;Bram Fischer: Afrikaner Revolutionary&quot;, which won the Alan Paton Award in 1999, and Martin Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Fischer&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

South African director Sharon Farr&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Love, Communism, Revolution &amp; Rivonia – Bram Fischer’s Story&quot;, won the Encounters Film Festival Audience Award for Best South African Documentary in August 2007.

Harry Kalmer wrote &quot;The Braam Fischer Waltz&quot; a play performed by David Butler at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown in 2013 and 2014.

In 2017 the feature film &quot;Bram Fischer&quot; (alternative title &quot;An Act of Defiance&quot;) directed by Jean van de Velde was released in the Netherlands, with the role of Bram Fischer played by Peter Paul Muller.

<text>The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation is a Braille code for encoding mathematical and scientific notation linearly using standard six-dot Braille cells for tactile reading by the visually impaired. The code was developed by Abraham Nemeth. The Nemeth Code was first written up in 1952. It was revised in 1956, 1965, and 1972. It is an example of a compact human-readable markup language.

Nemeth Braille is just one code used to write mathematics in braille. There are many systems in use around the world.

== Principles of the Nemeth Code ==
The Nemeth Code Book (1972) opens with the following words:

One consequence is that the braille transcriber does not need to know the underlying mathematics. The braille transcriber needs to identify the inkprint symbols and know how to render them in Nemeth Code braille. For example, if the same math symbol might have two different meanings, this would not matter; both instances would be brailled the same. This is in contrast to the International Braille Music Code, where the braille depends on the meaning of the inkprint music. Thus a knowledge of music is required to produce braille music.

<text>Edward Tuckerman (December 7, 1817, in Boston, Massachusetts – March 15, 1886) was an American botanist and professor who made significant contributions to the study of lichens and other alpine plants. He was a founding member of the Natural History Society of Boston and most of his career was spent at Amherst College. He did the majority of his collecting on the slopes of Mount Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Tuckerman Ravine was named in his honor. The standard botanical author abbreviation Tuck. is applied to species he described.

==Early life and education==
Tuckerman was the eldest son of a Boston merchant, also Edward Tuckerman, and Sophia (May) Tuckerman. He studied at Boston Latin School and then at his father&#x27;s urging at Union College in Schenectady, which he entered as a sophomore and where he completed a BA in 1837 and to which he returned for his MA after taking a law degree at Harvard in 1839, traveling in Germany and Scandinavia, and making the first of his botanical studies in the White Mountains. In 1846, he returned to Harvard as a senior (telling the President he intended to correct his father&#x27;s error in breaking the family tradition), completed a second BA in 1847, then two or three years later entered the Divinity School and graduated from there in 1852. His brother was Frederick Goddard Tuckerman (1821–1873), the American poet and his first cousin was Henry Theodore Tuckerman (1813–1871), an American writer, essayist and critic. His sister was the writer and spiritualist medium Sophia May Eckley (1822-174).

==Career==
When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark went on their 1804-1806 expedition across the western United States, they collected many plant, seed, and flower species that had never been seen before. Lewis wrote notes about these species and they were put on scrap book paper. After Lewis supposedly committed suicide in 1809, dozens of his scrapbook pages were stolen by a botanist who was supposed to draw and classify the plants collected on the expedition. He took the papers to England to sell for money at an auction in 1842. Tuckerman noticed the auction and the significance of these papers. He bought them and then donated them to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

After teaching at Union College, Tuckerman was a professor at Amherst College from 1854 until his death, successively Lecturer in History, Professor of Oriental History, and from 1858 Professor of Botany. Amherst awarded him an LLD.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.

His first paper, on New England lichens, was given in 1838 or 1839. In 1843, he published privately the first serious systematic analysis of the genus &quot;Carex&quot;, &quot;Enumeratio Methodica Caricum Quarundam.&quot; Tuckerman liked to write his botanical studies in Latin. He also made the first systematic study of native &quot;Potamogeton&quot;, and after becoming Professor of Botany at Amherst, began preparing &quot;A Catalogue of Plants Growing without cultivation within 30 miles of Amherst College&quot; (published in 1875). However, his main focus was lichens. He published a number of important studies in the field, drawing on both his own collecting and specimens sent to him from elsewhere, in particular by Charles Wright from Cuba. His career culminated in the publication of &quot;Genera Lichenum: An Arrangement of the North American Lichens&quot; (1872) and &quot;Synopsis of the North American Lichens&quot;, Part 1 (1882). Between 1847 and 1863 Tuckerman edited three exsiccata-like series, one of them being &quot;Lichenes Americae septentrionalis exsiccati, curante Edvardo Tuckerman&quot;. His last botanical publication was in 1884, and he may have published anonymous theological articles after that. Tuckerman did not accept that lichens are a combination of fungi and algae, a theory advanced late in his life.

===Honours===
He was honoured in the naming of several plant taxa including;
&quot;Tuckermania&quot; (family Ericaceae) now a synonym of &quot;Corema&quot;. and &quot;Tuckermannia&quot; (Asteraceae family) now a synonym of &quot;Coreopsis&quot;.

In 1933 Hungarian lichenologist Vilmos Kőfaragó-Gyelnik circumscribed the lichen genus of &quot;Tuckermannopsis&quot;.
&quot;Tuckneraria&quot; is a genus of lichen-forming fungi, which was published by Randlane &amp; A.Thell in 1994.
Lastly, Esslinger in 2003 published &quot;Tuckermanella&quot;, a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Parmeliaceae.

Between 1937 and 1942 the Farlow Herbarium distributed an exsiccatal series called &quot;Reliquiae Tuckermanianae&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tuckerman was married to Sarah, daughter of Thomas Parkman Cushing, who was his father&#x27;s business partner. They had no children.
Tuckerman died on March 15, 1886.

<text>The Roothaan equations are a representation of the Hartree–Fock equation in a non orthonormal basis set which can be of Gaussian-type or Slater-type. It applies to closed-shell molecules or atoms where all molecular orbitals or atomic orbitals, respectively, are doubly occupied. This is generally called Restricted Hartree–Fock theory.

The method was developed independently by Clemens C. J. Roothaan and George G. Hall in 1951, and is thus sometimes called the &quot;Roothaan-Hall equations&quot;. The Roothaan equations can be written in a form resembling generalized eigenvalue problem, although they are not a standard eigenvalue problem because they are nonlinear:

:formula_1

where F is the Fock matrix (which depends on the coefficients C due to electron-electron interactions), C is a matrix of coefficients, S is the overlap matrix of the basis functions, and formula_2 is the (diagonal, by convention) matrix of orbital energies. In the case of an orthonormalised basis set the overlap matrix, S, reduces to the identity matrix. These equations are essentially a special case of a Galerkin method applied to the Hartree–Fock equation using a particular basis set.

In contrast to the Hartree–Fock equations - which are integro-differential equations - the Roothaan–Hall equations have a matrix-form. Therefore, they can be solved using standard techniques.

<text>Woody Herman Shaw Jr. (December 24, 1944 – May 10, 1989) was an American jazz trumpeter, flugelhornist, cornetist, composer, arranger, band leader, and educator. Shaw is widely known as one of the 20th century&#x27;s most important and influential jazz trumpeters and composers. He is often credited with revolutionizing the technical and harmonic language of modern jazz trumpet playing, and is regarded by many as one of the major innovators of the instrument. He was an acclaimed virtuoso, mentor, and spokesperson for jazz and worked and recorded alongside many of the leading musicians of his time.

==Biography==
===Early life and background===
Woody Shaw was born in Laurinburg, North Carolina. When Shaw was a year old, his parents, Rosalie Pegues and Woody Shaw Sr., took their son to Newark, New Jersey. Shaw&#x27;s father was a member of the African American gospel group, The Diamond Jubilee Singers. Both parents attended the same secondary private school as Dizzy Gillespie: Laurinburg Institute. Shaw&#x27;s mother and Gillespie were both from the same town, Cheraw, South Carolina.

Shaw began playing the bugle when he was 9 and performed in the Newark Junior Elks, Junior Mason, and Washington Carver Drum and Bugle Corps. Though not his first choice of instrument, he began studying classical trumpet with Jerome Ziering at Cleveland Junior High School at the age of 11.

In a 1978 interview, Shaw explained:
The trumpet was not my first choice for an instrument. In fact, I ended up playing it by default. When we were asked what we wanted to play in the Eighteenth Avenue School Band, I chose the violin, but I was too late since all the violins were taken. My second choice was the saxophone or the trombone but they were also all spoken for. The only instrument that was left was the trumpet, and I felt why did I have to get stuck with this &quot;tinny&quot; sounding thing.

When I complained to my music teacher that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair that all the other kids got to play the instruments they wanted, he told me to just be patient. He said he had a good feeling about me and the trumpet, and he assured me I&#x27;d grow to love it. Of course my teacher was right, and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to fall in love with the trumpet. In retrospect, I believe there was some mystical force that brought us together.
Ziering encouraged him to continue his study of classical trumpet playing and pursue an education at the Juilliard School of music with trumpet instructor William Vacchiano, but Shaw had a deep interest in jazz. His first influences were Louis Armstrong and Harry James. After skipping two grades, he began attending Newark Arts High School (alma mater of Wayne Shorter, Sarah Vaughan, Melba Moore, Savion Glover, Larry Young, and many others), from which he graduated.

As a teenager, Shaw worked professionally at weddings, dances, and night clubs. He eventually left school but continued his study of the trumpet under the influence of Gillespie, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Booker Little, Lee Morgan, and Freddie Hubbard. He later discovered that he had picked up the trumpet during the same month and year that Brown died: June 1956.

===Paris and Eric Dolphy (early 1960s)===
In 1963, after many local professional jobs, Shaw worked for Willie Bobo (with Chick Corea and Joe Farrell), and performed and recorded as a sideman with Eric Dolphy, with whom he made his recorded debut, &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Dolphy, who was living in Paris, unexpectedly died in June 1964. Shaw was nonetheless invited to Paris to join Dolphy&#x27;s colleague, Nathan Davis,and the two men found steady work all over Europe. While living in Paris, they frequented the club Le Chat Qui Peche, and Shaw crossed paths with musicians such as Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, Johnny Griffin, Dexter Gordon, Art Taylor, other lesser-known musicians such as John Bodwin, and French musicians including Jean-Louis Chautemps, Rene Urtreger, Jacques Thollot and Jef Gilson. After some time, Shaw demanded that two of his contemporaries, organist Larry Young and drummer Billy Brooks, be relocated to Paris. The four young musicians – Davis, Shaw, Young, and Brooks – continued living and performing in France, intermittently touring cities in Europe, including Berlin, Germany.

===Blue Note Records (mid-to-late 1960s)===
By the mid-1960s, Shaw had successfully absorbed the concepts and influence of his mentor and friend, saxophonist Dolphy, and was meanwhile exploring the harmonic innovations of saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist McCoy Tyner. Both musicians contributed greatly to the development of Shaw&#x27;s style as a trumpeter and composer.

Shaw returned to the U.S. from Paris in 1965, and began his career as one of the Blue Note labels regular trumpet players, working steadily with their roster of artists. He replaced Carmell Jones in the Horace Silver quintet (1965–1966), and made his Blue Note debut on Silver&#x27;s &quot;The Cape Verdean Blues&quot;, followed by Larry Young&#x27;s &quot;Unity&quot; (1965); the album with Young featured three of his compositions (&quot;Zoltan&quot;, &quot;Moontrane&quot;, and &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot;). &quot;Moontrane&quot;, dedicated to Coltrane, was written when Shaw was 18 years old and was his earliest composition.

Shaw also collaborated frequently and recorded with Corea (1966–67, 1969), Jackie McLean (1967), Booker Ervin (1968), Tyner (1968), Andrew Hill (1969), Herbie Hancock, and Bobby Hutcherson. In 1968–69, he worked intermittently with Max Roach, touring with him in Iran. Shaw also worked as a studio musician, in pit orchestras, and on Broadway musicals.

===Contemporary and Muse (early-to-mid 1970s)===
In 1970, Shaw recorded his first album as a leader, &quot;Blackstone Legacy,&quot; for Contemporary Records. &quot;Blackstone Legacy&quot; featured Bennie Maupin, Ron Carter, George Cables, Gary Bartz, Clint Houston, and Lenny White. This was followed by a second release under Shaw&#x27;s name, entitled &quot;Song of Songs&quot;. During this time, Shaw moved to San Francisco to explore new opportunities and became closely associated with musicians on the West Coast such as Bobby Hutcherson, Eddie Moore, Eddie Marshall, and Henry Franklin.

In 1974, Shaw returned from California to New York, beginning an association with Muse Records, recording the albums – &quot;The Moontrane&quot;, &quot;Love Dance&quot;, &quot;Little Red&#x27;s Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Iron Men&quot;, with musicians from the mid-western creative black arts scene such as Anthony Braxton, Arthur Blythe and Muhal Richard Abrams.

===Columbia Records (late-1970s)===
After working frequently with Hutcherson, Art Blakey, Tyner and others, Shaw emerged as a band leader during the early 1970s, which was a time when many jazz artists began to explore jazz-rock. A younger statesman among his elders, Shaw saw himself as an heir to the musical legacy of trumpeters such as Gillespie, Navarro, and Brown, and, being an alumnus of Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers, felt responsible for upholding the integrity and appreciation of the tradition.

After releasing several albums for the Muse label, Shaw signed to Columbia Records in 1977 following an endorsement from Miles Davis. He then recorded the albums &quot;Rosewood&quot;, &quot;Stepping Stones: Live at the Village Vanguard&quot;, &quot;Woody III&quot;, &quot;For Sure!&quot;, and &quot;United&quot;.

&quot;Rosewood&quot; was nominated for two Grammys and was voted Best Jazz Album of 1978 in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll, which also voted Shaw Best Jazz Trumpeter of the Year, and No. 4 Jazz Musician of the Year.

===1980s===
Throughout the &#x27;80s, Shaw continued performing and recording as a leader with sidemen such as pianists Onaje Allan Gumbs, Mulgrew Miller, and Larry Willis, bassist David Williams, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, and trombonist Steve Turre, recording a number of more &quot;traditional&quot; but highly lyrical albums (&quot;Solid&quot;, &quot;Setting Standards&quot;, &quot;In My Own Sweet Way&quot;) consisting mainly of standards and tunes from the hard bop repertoire. During this time he also worked on projects with saxophonists Benny Golson, Kenny Garrett and Dexter Gordon, as well as fellow trumpeter Freddie Hubbard on three albums (&quot;Double Take&quot;, and &quot;The Eternal Triangle&quot;, reissued on Blue Note as &quot;The Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw Sessions&quot;) and Golson&#x27;s &quot;Time Speaks&quot;.

===Health issues and death===
By the late &#x27;80s, Shaw was nearly blind from retinitis pigmentosa, an incurable degenerative eye disease. A heroin user throughout his adult life, Shaw was in poor health when he returned to the U.S. in early 1989 from a lengthy stay in Europe and needed a wheelchair at the airport. On the morning of February 27, 1989, Shaw was struck by a subway car in Brooklyn, New York, which mangled his left arm and caused other injuries including head trauma; doctors were forced to amputate his arm. The night before the accident, Max Roach sent a limousine to Newark where Shaw was staying, to bring Shaw to the Village Vanguard to hear Roach play. After the set, Roach put Shaw into a taxi around midnight with enough money to get back to Newark. Shaw did not go to Newark; it is unclear what led to the accident later that morning. During his hospital stay at Bellevue, Shaw suffered kidney failure, was put on a respirator and lost consciousness for more than a month. He died from kidney failure May 10, 1989, at age 44.

==Legacy revival==
The years between 2003 and 2013 saw a resurgence of interest in, and recognition of, Shaw&#x27;s music. In 2003, Shaw&#x27;s son, Woody Louis Armstrong Shaw III, launched The Official Woody Shaw Website, which helped to bolster appreciation for Shaw&#x27;s contribution to music. Since then, many of Shaw&#x27;s long-out-of-print recordings have been reissued, remastered and repackaged, under the curatorial oversight of Shaw&#x27;s son and long-time producer Michael Cuscuna.

In 2012, PopMarket, a division of Sony Legacy, released &quot;Woody Shaw: The Complete Columbia Albums Collection&quot;, and in 2013, Mosaic Records released &quot;Woody Shaw: The Complete Muse Sessions&quot;, for which NPR described Shaw as &quot;the last great trumpet innovator&quot;.

Shaw III, the primary inspiration for Shaw&#x27;s third Columbia album, &quot;Woody III&quot; (dedicated to Shaw&#x27;s father and newborn son), is the sole heir to his father&#x27;s legacy. Today, Shaw III preserves the Shaw legacy through the production, management, archiving and preservation of his father&#x27;s life&#x27;s work. Shaw&#x27;s legacy is kept active and relevant through the use of social media and the official website.

==Innovations==
Shaw was noted for his mastery and innovative use of &quot;wide&quot; intervals, often fourths and fifths, which are considered relatively unnatural to the trumpet and difficult to employ skillfully due to (a) the technical facility required to do so, (b) the architecture of the instrument, (c) the trumpet&#x27;s inherent harmonic tendencies based on the overtone series, and (d) its traditional association with intervals based more commonly on thirds and diatonic relationships.

In both his improvisations and his compositions, Shaw frequently used polytonality, the combination of two or more tonalities or keys (i.e. multiple chords or harmonic structures) at once. In his solos, he often superimposed highly complex permutations of the pentatonic scale and sequences of intervals that modulated unpredictably through numerous key centers. He was a master of modality and used a wide range of harmonic color, generating unusual contrasts, using tension and resolution, dissonance, odd rhythmic groupings, and &quot;over the barline&quot; phrases, yet always resolving his ideas according to the form and harmonic structure of a given composition while adhering to the conventions of jazz improvisation and simultaneously creating new ones.

His &quot;attack&quot; was remarkably clean and precise, regardless of tempo (Shaw often played extremely fast passages). He had a rich, dark tone that was distinctive with a near-vocal quality to it; his intonation and articulation were highly developed, and he greatly utilized the effects of the lower register, usually employing a deep, extended vibrato at the end of his phrases. Shaw also often incorporated the chromatic scale, which gave his melodic lines a subtle fluidity that seemed to allow him to weave &quot;in and out&quot; of chords seamlessly from all &quot;angles&quot;.

Shaw was also born with an extraordinary memory and perfect pitch. Max Roach once stated: &quot;He was truly one of the greatest. I first had occasion to work with Woody on a trip to Iran. One of the most amazing things was his uncanny memory. I was just flabbergasted. After one look, he knew all of the charts, no matter how complex they were.&quot;

Shaw&#x27;s improvisational and composing style bears the influences of his idols Dolphy, Coltrane and Tyner, as well as many European modern classical and 20th-century composers such as Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Erik Satie, Alexander Scriabin, Carlos Chavez, Ernest Bloch, Olivier Messiaen, Paul Hindemith, Charles Ives, Edgar Varese, Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Colin McPhee. Shaw also listened closely to traditional Japanese music, Indonesian Gamelan, Indian classical music, Brazilian music, and various other musics of the world.

==Educator==
Throughout his career, Shaw gave countless clinics, master classes and private lessons to students around the world. During the 1970s, he and Joe Henderson were faculty members in Jamey Aebersold&#x27;s jazz camp. NEA Grant recipients who studied with Shaw include Wynton Marsalis (musical director of Jazz at Lincoln Center), and Ingrid Monson (Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music, Harvard University). Other students and apprentices include Chris Botti, Wallace Roney, and Terence Blanchard.

==Admiration among musicians==
As a musician and trumpeter, Shaw was held in high esteem by his colleagues and is seen as one of the most technically and harmonically advanced trumpet players in the history of jazz and of the instrument itself. Miles Davis, a notoriously harsh critic of fellow musicians, once said of Shaw: &quot;Now there&#x27;s a great trumpet player. He can play different from all of them.&quot; Trumpeter Dave Douglas stated: &quot;It&#x27;s not only the brilliant imagination that captivates with Woody Shaw – it&#x27;s how natural those fiendishly difficult lines feel... Woody Shaw is now one of the most revered figures for trumpeters today.&quot;

Shaw is credited with having extended the harmonic and technical vocabulary of the trumpet. Upon hearing of Shaw&#x27;s death in 1989, Wynton Marsalis stated: &quot;Woody added to the vocabulary of the trumpet. His whole approach influenced me tremendously.&quot; Multi-genre producer, instrumentalist and rapper, Madlib, also cites Shaw as an inspiration. In an interview with Red Bull Music Academy, Madlib listed Shaw as his favorite trumpet player, saying of his music: &quot;It’s electric and acoustic, traditional and non-traditional — that’s what I’m all about.&quot;

==Travels==
Throughout his life, Shaw travelled all over Europe. He first moved to France at 19. As a sideman with Roach, he traveled to Iran in 1969. He also toured such places as Japan, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia.

During a 1980s tour for the United States Information Service, Shaw ventured to such countries as Egypt, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates. Recently, it has been discovered that Shaw spent significant time performing and giving clinics in India, working in cities such as New Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, and Calcutta. When asked by film producer Chuck France in an interview whether he thought traveling was important, Shaw responded: &quot;Most definitely. I think every great artist should share his music with the world.&quot;

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1969), Austrian Academy of Sciences (1992), US National Academy Sciences (1971), Pontifical Academy of Sciences (1994), Russian Academy of Sciences (1988), Academia Europaea (1999), and the Royal Astronomical Society (1989).

He served as the President, International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (1987–1991), Vice President, International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth’s Interior (1983–1987), Board Member and Chair of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Section, International Council of Scientific Unions (1988–1991), Founding Chairman, International Committee for Geophysical Theory and Computers (1964–1979), and Expert, Technical meetings on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1960–1990). 

He was also a member of: Committee for International Security and Disarmament, Russian Academy of Sciences (1998–2000); The Union&#x27;s Scientific Committee for the UN Decade for Natural Disasters Reduction (1990–1999); International Working Group on the Geological Safety of Nuclear Waste Depositories (1994–1997).

He was awarded the First Lewis Fry Richardson Medal for exceptional contributions to non-linear geophysics (1998), a Doctor Honoris Causa, Institut de Physique du Globe, Paris, and the 21st Century Collaborative Activity Award for Studying Complex Systems, McDonnell Foundation.

His team of researchers used new algorithmic methods for earthquake prediction. Keilis-Borok&#x27;s method has been retroactively applied to 31 cases dating back to 1989, with correlation 25 times (not including two near misses), including the Samoa area quake (September, 2009) and the Sumatra quake (September, 2009). 

In 2003, he and his team predicted the San Simeon (December 2003) and Hokkaido (September 2003) earthquakes. 

In response to his prediction of an earthquake in California in 2005, US Geological Survey has said: &quot;The work of the Keilis-Borok team is a legitimate approach to earthquake prediction research. However, the method is unproven, and it will take much additional study, and many additional trial predictions, before it can be shown whether it works, and how well.&quot; The California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council determined, &quot;To date there is no evidence that these, or related methods, yield useful intermediate term forecasts.&quot; No earthquake occurred in the predicted location or time period.

Keilis-Borok, in collaboration with Allan Lichtman, used some of his techniques to create The Keys to the White House, a presidential election prediction system. It has accurately predicted every United States presidential election since 1984, with the exception of the 2024 election and 2000 election.

Between 1998 and 2013, Keilis-Borok was a Regents&#x27; Professor, Professor, and Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was the research group leader at the International Institute for Earthquake Prediction Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, Russian Academy of Science, and the Co-Director (and Founder) of the Research program on non-linear dynamics and earthquake prediction of the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste.

He died in Culver City, California, on October 19, 2013.

<text>Bede Griffiths OSB Cam (17 December 1906 – 13 May 1993), born Alan Richard Griffiths and also known by the end of his life as Swami Dayananda (&quot;bliss of compassion&quot;), was a British-born Catholic priest and Benedictine monk who lived in ashrams in South India and became a noted missionary. Griffiths was a part of the Christian Ashram Movement.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Griffiths was born in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England, at the end of 1906, the youngest of three children of a middle-class family. Shortly after Griffiths&#x27; birth, his father was betrayed by a business partner and was left penniless. His mother took the children and established residence in a smaller home which she maintained, though she had to find work to support herself and the children. At age 12, Griffiths was sent to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, a private charity school for children from families of modest means. He excelled in his studies and earned a scholarship to the University of Oxford where, in 1925, he began his studies in English literature and philosophy at Magdalen College. In his third year at university he came under the tutelage of C. S. Lewis, who became a lifelong friend. Griffiths graduated from Oxford in 1929 with a degree in journalism.

Shortly after graduation Griffiths, with fellow Oxford alumni Martyn Skinner and Hugh Waterman, settled in a cottage in the Cotswolds and began what they called an &quot;experiment in common living&quot;. They followed a lifestyle attuned to nature, milking cows and selling the milk to support themselves. They would read the Bible together as a form of literature. Griffiths noted a strong connection between the teachings of scripture and the rhythm of the nature around them. The experiment lasted less than a year, as one of the friends found the life too demanding. Nevertheless, the experience had a strong effect on Griffiths.

As a result of this experience, Griffiths decided to seek ordination in the Church of England. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London. This advice was so contrary to what Griffiths felt to be his vocation that it drove him to a crisis of faith, which nearly drove him to an emotional breakdown yet, guided by the writings of Cardinal Newman, he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough.

In November 1931, Griffiths went to stay at the Benedictine monastery of Prinknash Abbey where he was impressed by the life. Despite the strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiments of his mother, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and made his First Communion at Christmas Eve Mass at the abbey.

===Benedictine monastic life===
Griffiths was received by the abbey as a postulant a month after his reception into the Catholic Church. On 29 December 1932, he entered the novitiate and was given the monastic name of &quot;Bede&quot;. He made his solemn profession in 1937 (a year before the death of his mother in a car accident) and was ordained to the Catholic priesthood in 1940.

In 1947 the abbey sent a group of 25 monks to give support to two monasteries in the United Kingdom which had been founded by monks from France. Griffiths was chosen to be the obedientiary prior for the monastery at Farnborough in Hampshire. He led that house for four years, but was unable to generate sufficient financial support to keep the community going. The abbot then sent him to the other monastery, Pluscarden Abbey in Scotland. It was there that he wrote his autobiography.

During Griffiths&#x27; time at Farnborough, he had come to know Father Benedict Alapatt, a European-born monk of Indian descent who was greatly interested in establishing a monastery in his homeland. Griffiths had already been introduced to Eastern thought, yoga and the Vedas and took interest in this proposed project. The abbot at first refused permission, but later changed his mind and authorised Griffiths to go to India with the Indian member of the community. There was one condition, though: Griffiths was not to be there as a member of the abbey, but as a priest subject to a local bishop, which meant that he would be giving up his vows.

===Christian Missionary===
After some painful inner debate, Griffiths agreed to this and, in 1955, he embarked for India with Alapatt. At the time, he wrote to a friend: &quot;I am going to discover the other half of my soul.&quot; After arriving and visiting some spiritual centres in the country, they settled in Kengeri in Bangalore with the goal of building a monastery there. That project was eventually unsuccessful as Griffiths left the location in 1958, saying that he found it &quot;too Western&quot;.

Griffiths then joined with a Belgian monk, Father Francis Acharya, OCSO, to establish Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram (&quot;Mountain of the Cross&quot;), a Syriac Rite monastery of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in Kerala. They sought to develop a form of monastic life based in the Indian tradition, adopting the saffron garments of an Indian &quot;sannyasi&quot; (an ascetic or monk). At that point, Griffiths took the Sanskrit name &quot;Dayananda&quot; (&quot;bliss of compassion&quot;). During that time he continued his studies in the religions and cultures of India, writing &quot;Christ in India&quot; while there. He also visited the United States during the period, giving a number of talks about East–West dialogue and being interviewed by CBS television.

Later, in 1968, Griffiths moved to the Saccidananda Ashram (also known as &quot;Shantivanam&quot;; Tamil for &quot;forest of peace&quot;) in Tamil Nadu, South India, which had been founded in 1950 by the French Benedictine monk Abhishiktananda (Dom Henri Le Saux, OSB), from the Abbey of Kergonan, along with another Frenchman, the Abbé Jules Monchanin. The two had developed a religious lifestyle which was completely expressed in authentic Indian fashion, using English, Sanskrit and Tamil in their religious services. They had built the ashram buildings by hand in the style of the poor of the country. Monchanin had died in 1957 and Le Saux wanted to devote himself to a hermit&#x27;s life. Griffiths came with two other monks to assume life there and to allow Le Saux his wish.

Griffiths resumed his studies of Indian thought, trying to relate it to Christian theology. At this point, he became known as &quot;Swami Dayananda&quot; (&quot;bliss of compassion&quot;). He wrote 12 books on Hindu–Christian dialogue. During this period, Griffiths desired to reconnect himself with the Benedictine order and sought a monastic congregation which would accept him in the way of life he had developed over the decades. He was welcomed by the Camaldolese monks, and he and the ashram became a part of their congregation.

Griffiths was a strict vegetarian who followed a sattvic diet of fruit, vegetables and dairy products.

===Final years===
In January 1990, Griffiths suffered a stroke in his room at the ashram. A month later, to the day, he was declared healed. The following year, he began a period of extensive travel, making annual visits to the United States, then later to Europe, where he met the Dalai Lama. He noted to a friend, &quot;I do believe that he liked me.&quot; He continued his journey, giving lectures in Germany and England. He arrived back at the ashram in October 1992, where an Australian film crew were awaiting him to make a documentary about his life, which was released as &quot;A Human Search&quot;.

Three days after the completion of filming, on his 86th birthday, Griffiths had a major stroke. The following month, he had a further series of strokes. He died at Shantivanam on 13 May 1993, aged 86.

==Legacy==
The archives of the Bede Griffiths Trust are located at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. His contributions are promoted and developed by the Bede Griffiths Trust and by the Camaldolese Institute for East–West Dialogue based at the American Camaldolese hermitage of New Camaldoli, located in Big Sur, California.

<text>Thórsmörk (, ) is a mountain ridge in Iceland that was named after the Norse god Thor (Þór). It is situated in the south of Iceland between the glaciers Tindfjallajökull and Eyjafjallajökull. The name &quot;Thórsmörk&quot; properly refers only to the mountain ridge between the rivers Krossá, Þröngá, and Markarfljót, but is sometimes used informally to describe a wider area that includes the region between Thórsmörk and Eyjafjallajökull. Thórsmörk is one of the most popular hiking areas in Iceland.

In the valley, the river Krossá winds between the mountains. The valley is closed in between glaciers, Mýrdalsjökull being at the rear end of the valley. This leads to an especially warm climate, better than in the rest of south Iceland. In the protected valley, green vegetation of moss, fern, birchwood, and other small shrubs are found.

Thórsmörk is popular amongst hikers. Many different tours are possible, from hiking on the glaciers to trekking (i.e., Laugavegur up to Landmannalaugar) or smaller excursions, such as to the canyon Stakkholtsgjá with its waterfall or five small day treks, to the summits of surrounding peaks, with rewarding views, even in bad weather. The Krossá is a cold, fast river coming down from glaciers; a bridge allows pedestrians to cross. Coaches arrive daily from Reykjavík and other towns in Iceland.

== Volcanic ash from Eyjafjallajökull ==
During the spring 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, much of the area was covered in a thick layer of volcanic ash. Several months were needed for nature to return to normal.

<text>John Beatty (December 10, 1749 – May 30, 1826) was an American physician, statesman and slaveowner from Princeton, New Jersey.

==Early life==

He was born in Neshaminy in the Province of Pennsylvania on December 10, 1749. Beatty was the oldest of ten children of Irish born Rev. Charles Clinton Beatty and Anne (née Reading) Beatty, who were married in 1746. His father was a Presbyterian minister who did missionary work among the Native Americans.

His maternal grandfather was John Reading, president of the New Jersey Provincial Council and acting Governor of the province of New Jersey. His paternal grandparents were John Beatty and Christiana (née Clinton) Beatty. John&#x27;s grandmother was the daughter of James Clinton and the sister of Charles Clinton (himself the father of Revolutionary War Major General James Clinton and Vice President George Clinton, and the grandfather of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton).

Beatty graduated from the College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton University) in 1769. He was a student of Founding Father Benjamin Rush.

==Career==

Beatty became a doctor and opened his first practice in Hartsville, Pennsylvania. He rose to the rank of major in the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was captured at the surrender of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776. After his exchange, he was appointed Commissary General for Prisoners with the rank of colonel.

By the end of the war he had become a resident of New Jersey, serving as a member of the New Jersey Legislative Council (now the New Jersey Senate) from 1781 to 1783, representing Middlesex County, and delegate from that state to the Continental Congress in 1784 and 1785.

In 1784, when Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s proposed ban on slavery in all future territories came up for a vote in Congress, Beatty became sick and was absent from the meeting. As Jefferson noted, &quot;[Je]rsey would have been for it, but there were but two members, one of whom [Beatty] was sick in his chambers&quot;; thus, New Jersey could not submit its vote. The proposal failed to pass by one vote.

Beatty was the speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1789 to 1790, an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1791, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in the Third Congress from 1793 to 1795. While serving in the U.S. House, he was one of nine representatives to vote against the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. He later served as Secretary of State of New Jersey from 1795 to 1805.

==Personal life==
Beatty was married to Catherine DeKlyn, the daughter of Mary (née Van Sant) DeKlyn and Barnt DeKlyn, who became wealthy selling textiles to the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Together, they were the parents of Robert Beatty and William Beatty.

Beatty was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of New Jersey, and served as the organization&#x27;s treasurer from 1823 until his death on May 30, 1826, in Trenton in Mercer County, New Jersey.

===Legacy===
The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a collection of personal papers, including diaries, correspondences and genealogical notes, related to the Beatty Family. Besides John Beatty&#x27;s papers, the collection also includes journals by his father, Charles Clinton Beatty, who served as an early missionary with George Duffield among Native Americans.

<text>Mopar (a portmanteau of &quot;motor&quot; and &quot;parts&quot;) is an American car parts, service, and customer care division of the former Chrysler Corporation, now owned by Netherlands-based automobile manufacturer Stellantis. It serves as a primary OEM accessory seller for Stellantis companies under the Mopar brand. &quot;Mopar&quot; is also used as a nickname by enthusiasts of Chrysler-built products to refer to any product built by the company.

Mopar also designs and builds a small number of customized vehicles.

==History==

The term was created by an internal activities council and was first used by Chrysler in 1937 as a product name to put on cans of Chrysler Motor Parts Antifreeze. This new branded product became known as &quot;MoPar antifreeze&quot; a portmanteau of the terms &quot;motor&quot; and &quot;parts&quot;.

Mopar parts are original equipment manufactured parts for FCA US LLC vehicles. The term &quot;Mopar&quot; has passed into broader usage among car enthusiasts as an unambiguous reference to vehicles produced by former parent company Chrysler Corporation/Chrysler Group LLC/FCA US LLC, now known as Stellantis. 

The term has thus become an inclusive word for any Chrysler-built vehicle— almost any Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth, Imperial, DeSoto, Fargo (Canada-only in later years) or Dodge Trucks/Ram. By extension, it is also used for Jeep and AMC vehicles built after Chrysler&#x27;s 1987 buyout of American Motors Corporation, including the short-lived Eagle brand.

In Canada, Chrysler parts were sold under the &quot;Chryco&quot; and &quot;AutoPar&quot; brands until the Mopar brand was introduced into that nation&#x27;s market, starting in the late 1970s.

==Custom cars==
Mopar does not have dedicated assembly lines. There are 13 Mopar Custom Shops that install customer-chosen accessories on their vehicles prior to delivery.

There are also limited-edition Mopar versions of FCA vehicles. These are marketed featuring custom paint and equipped with numerous Mopar performance and cosmetic modifications.

An example was the 2013 Dodge Dart finished in black with an offset Mopar Blue racing stripe and featuring sport-tuned steering, exhaust, premium brakes with slotted rotors, lowered sport suspension, and gloss black 18-inch aluminum wheels with low profile performance tires. The Dart had production plans for 500 units.

A special edition Mopar 2017 Dodge Challenger was introduced at the 2017 Chicago Auto Show as part of 80th anniversary of the Mopar brand. A total of 160 were built: half were finished in &quot;contusion blue&quot; with &quot;pitch black&quot; effects and the second half in &quot;billet silver&quot; with &quot;pitch black&quot; accents.

==Sponsorship==

Over its 80 years, Mopar has sponsored a number of racers in a variety of motorsports series. 

In 1996, Mopar sponsored the No. 30 car of Jimmy Hensley in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. From 2004 to 2007 Mopar sponsored the No. 9 car driven by Kasey Kahne in the Nextel Cup Series for the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. They also sponsored his sprint car.

In the United States and Canada, Mopar participates in Formula D. Formula Drift drivers are Samuel Hübinette, and in Canadian Drift Championship Vanessa Ozawa, Kevin Huynh, and John Yakomoto. Mopar had sponsored NHRA drag racer Allen Johnson in that series&#x27; Pro Stock division for 20 years, but for 2016 season they sponsored Jegs Coughlin Jr. and Erica Enders-Stevens.

Mopar remains active in drag racing events. It sponsors Don Schumacher Racing drivers, such as Tony Schumacher, in the Funny Car and Top Fuel classes of the NHRA Camping World Drag Racing Series. Drivers of the Mopar Dodge Challenger Drag Pak are eligible for a variety of Mopar contingency awards and benefits.

Mopar sponsors the Mopar Mile-High NHRA Nationals held each July in Denver. It is the longest-running sponsorship in all of drag racing.

<text>The Helsinki Citizens&#x27; Assembly (hCa) is an international organization of citizens dedicated to peace and democracy. The hCa functions as a non-governmental organization working to improve fundamental rights and freedoms, pluralism, and human rights in Europe.

==History and objectives==
The Helsinki Citizens&#x27; Assembly was founded in October 1990 in Prague, Czechoslovakia as an international working conference. Over one thousand delegates from Western and Eastern Europe attended. Civil society groups, women&#x27;s organizations, trade unions, peace organizations, and representatives from the European Union participated in the founding meeting.

The hCa works independently from political parties, government and states, and aims to:

* introduce the basic rights and freedoms accepted in international agreements and outlined by universal standards into daily life
* to promote peaceful processes for the resolution of problems through mutual understanding dialogue and peace
* to improve pluralist democratic bodies and civil society initiatives
* to ensure the supremacy of law and to defend an economic system that promotes the well-being of human life and the environment

The Helsinki Final Act (1975) provided a basis for creating conditions favorable to peace in Europe and made human rights a common value to be respected by all nations in a world which was divided into East and West camps in that period. The word &quot;Helsinki&quot; refers to the historic significance of this agreement.

The collapse of the Berlin Wall and the new global political context this created gave rise to a new peace movement called the &quot;Helsinki Citizens&#x27; Assembly&quot;. From October 19 to 22 1990, peace activists from all parts of Europe (chaired by Václav Havel, then president of Czechoslovakia) held a meeting. They agreed on the &quot;Prague Appeal&quot; and founded the hCa as a permanent forum, within which peace and civic groups, as well as individuals and institutions representing a broad spectrum of views, could exchange experiences, discuss common concerns and formulate joint campaigns and strategies.

As stated in the Founding document (Prague, 1990):
&quot;Overcoming the division of Europe is the job, especially, of civil society, of citizens acting together in self-organized associations, movements, institutions, initiatives and clubs across national boundaries. It means the creation of new social relationships, new forms of dialogue, through which citizens can negotiate with governments and each other, put pressure on political institutions, and, indeed, resolve many issues without the direct involvement of governments. It means the expansion of public -that is, non-State, non-private- spheres of activity and the creation of a European public opinion. The commitment of politicians to open diplomacy must go beyond the ante-chamber of high politics. It is not just a matter of informing journalists or even non-governmental organizations. The Helsinki process from above has to be complemented by an equally significant Helsinki process from below.&quot;

&quot;Let us therefore found a Helsinki Citizens Assembly!&quot;
The idea was to set up different national hCa chapters, many of which still exist today. In its first news bulletin, an impressive list of projects and activities was published. These included editorials by Mary Kaldor and Mient Jan Faber, reports from national committees, various conferences, a directory of 42 national contact persons for HCA, etc.

In the early nineties, the hCa initiative very much resembled other large international networks, like the END-Convention and IPCC (International Peace Communication and Coordination Center) and many of the activists and organizations of END and IPCC joined the hCa. The main differences between hCa and the two other networks was that hCa had a great potential of being more than just a network of peace organizations, including also activists and groups working around other issues, like North-South relations.

Chapters of the hCa organize seminars, workshops, meetings, and conferences at the local, national, and international levels. Chapters often cooperate with other NGOs, civil society, and think tanks.

==Areas of operation==
The hCa maintains active branches across Europe, including countries from the Balkans, the Caucasus, and from EU member states.

<text>Ruislip Gardens () is a London Underground station. It lies on the Central line, between West Ruislip and South Ruislip, in Travelcard Zone 5. The closest stations on the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line are Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. The station serves RAF Northolt.

== History ==
The tracks through the station were laid by part of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway with services starting on 2 April 1906 although there was no station at Ruislip Gardens at that time. The station opened on 9 July 1934.

As part of the 1935-40 New Works Programme, Central line services were projected westwards from a new junction, west of North Acton on the line to Ealing Broadway. The original intention was to extend the service as far as Denham, but work was delayed by World War II and the formation of the Metropolitan Green Belt after the war and so the terminus of the extension was cut back to West Ruislip, with services starting on 21 November 1948.

The main line services stopping at Ruislip Gardens ceased on 21 July 1958 and the station closed, leaving only the Central line services in place. Until recently the entrance to a passenger stairwell was visible on the London-bound side of the Chiltern tracks.

== The station today ==
The station has an island platform layout. Some services start or terminate here rather than West Ruislip, the trains leaving or entering the Central line depot to the west of the station, south of the running lines. There is a link from the Central line depot for stock movement to the Metropolitan line just to the west of Ruislip via a shunting neck.

A running link round the southern boundary of the depot has several times been proposed, to make a connection with the Metropolitan line. This would allow through running of Central line trains onwards from Ruislip Gardens to Uxbridge, but nothing has ever come of these suggestions.

== Local places of note ==
RAF Northolt and a Polish War Memorial are also close by.

==In popular culture ==
The station achieved poetic immortality in John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;Middlesex&quot;:

:&quot;Gaily into Ruislip Gardens&quot;
:&quot;Runs the red electric train,&quot;
:&quot;With a thousand Ta&#x27;s and Pardon&#x27;s&quot;
:&quot;Daintily alights Elaine;&quot;
:&quot;Hurries down the concrete station&quot;
:&quot;With a frown of concentration,&quot;
:&quot;Out into the outskirt&#x27;s edges&quot;
:&quot;Where a few surviving hedges&quot;
:&quot;Keep alive our lost Elysium – Rural Middlesex again.&quot;

==Connections==
London Buses route E7 and school route 696 serve the station.

<doc id="696881" wikidata="Q851349" url="?curid=696881" title="Rosy-billed pochard">
<text>The rosy-billed pochard (Netta peposaca), alternatively named rosybill or rosybill pochard, is a member of family Anatidae. Though classified as a diving duck, this pochard feeds more like a dabbling duck feeding on seeds roots, sedges, aquatic plants and other grasses. &quot;Netta&quot; is Ancient Greek for &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;peposaca&quot; is a transcription of the Guaraní name of this species which means &quot;showy wings&quot;, referring to the broad white stripe that is only visible with stretched out wings. Male characteristic features include a bright red bill with a rounded knob at the base.

The rosy-billed pochard is endemic to South America. It is found in Argentina, central Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The population in southern Argentina migrates northward during the austral winter, reaching Brazil and southern Bolivia. It is a vagrant to the Falkland Islands.

==Taxonomy==
The rosy-billed pochard is one of five pochard species that make up the genus &quot;Netta,&quot; which is one of 31 genera of the subfamily Anatinae. Within subfamily Anatinae, there is a tribe called Aythini. This tribe was thought to be limited to the Northern Hemisphere (what was believed to be the Palearctic), and experienced three or four bursts of speciation, one of which was by the ancestor of the rosy-billed and southern pochards. Rosy-billed pochards were first described in 1816 by taxon author Viellot, in Paraguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The species is highly autapomorphic and is placed in a sister-group with the southern pochard, but evidence for this relationship is lacking. Additionally, they have been known to hybridize with the red-crested pochard and other pochards from ornamental waterfowl collections. The rosybill is monotypic and thus no further classifications exist.

==Description==
Like many other members of family Anatidae, the rosy-billed pochard exhibits significant sexual dimorphism. Males have a purplish-black head, neck and breast with gray sides, a white area on the crissum (the area around the cloaca), and a bright red bill and red eyes. The bill has a large rounded knob, which is bright red, and rest of the bill gradually fades towards a pale pink before ending with a black tip. The rounded knob of the bill increases in size and intensity in colour during the mating season. When in flight, the mostly dark plumage noticeably contrasts with the white primaries and secondaries. The legs and feet are yellow to orange. On the other hand, females are dull and brown. The bill is bluish-gray with a black tip and the legs are yellow-orange to gray. The contrasting white crissum is the most noticeable feature on females.

Young are almost identical in appearance to the females, but their underparts are darker. Rosybill adults lack the dull eclipse plumage that is characteristic of northern individuals of the genera &quot;Aytha&quot; and &quot;Anas&quot;.

Males tend to be slightly larger than females, but in general both sexes are very similar in terms of body size. Adults can grow to about 22 inches (56 cm) in length and weigh 2.2-2.6 pounds (1-1.2 kg). Despite these pochards being strong fliers, their blunt-tipped wings require a faster wing-beats than that of many ducks and they have some trouble taking off. They do not walk as well on land as other dabbling ducks because their legs are placed further back on their bodies to help propel them when underwater. Their minimum wingspan recorded is 72 cm, while the maximum is 84 cm.

==Distribution and habitat==
Rosy-billed pochards nest within tall grasses in wetlands, mainly in areas that extend from the central provinces of Córdoba, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, and Buenos Aires, southwards to Río Negro. Individuals are also found in shallow freshwater swamps, marshes and small lakes.

They are a fully migrant species and their movements are heavily associated with water conditions. Seasonal dry periods are common in central Argentina and they force birds to move towards larger water areas in late summer. By early fall, these areas are often dry and individuals are forced to move to find more water and better food sources elsewhere. An increase in population size can be seen during wet periods.

==Behaviour==
Rosy-billed pochards are highly sociable ducks and may congregate in flocks of thousands of individuals.

===Diet===
Rosybills are omnivorous ducks, feeding on mostly knotgrass and barnyard grasses, but also roots, sedges, aquatic plants and other grasses and some animal products. However, their diet is dominated by seed consumption. This seed-dominated diet is due to the need to obtain carbohydrate-rich food, which is essential for meeting their thermoregulation requirements for the season. The seeds are high in energy, and this energy is also important for controlling temperature stressors. Though they are classified as diving ducks, they feed by dabbling on the surface of the water, upending in shallow water and occasionally grazing on land, but they rarely dive. Since the rosybill has a relative general diet and does not depend on a single food source, the species is said to be relatively adaptable to the offer of alternate food sources.

===Reproduction===
Each breeding season, a male and female rosy-billed pochard will form a seasonal bond. The pairs, however, are not monogamous and they do not pair for life. A distinct spring courtship period exists during which courtship displays are important. The courtship displays are performed before breedings and consist of distinct movements performed by both sexes. The displays include exaggerated drinking activities, mock preenings, head bobbings and neck extensions. Breeding generally occurs in October to November and can be done in single pairs or in small groups.

Females construct nests using plant matter and they line the nest with down. Nests are normally built over the water at the edge of the water. Females have also been observed to make their nests in rice fields.

The female lays up to 10 cream to greenish coloured eggs and she may even lay her eggs in another bird&#x27;s nest if available. Eggs are incubated for 27-29 days, and fledging occurs within 50-75 days. Females will raise the ducklings without help from the males. Occasionally, broods from different females will merge and females will raise the young as a collective.

===Vocalizations===

Similar to almost all other bird species, rosybills have different calls used for different purposes. The characteristic &#x27;honk&#x27; of family Anatidae is obvious in this pochard&#x27;s vocalization, however it is much deeper as compared to a mallard, for example. Based on limited recordings of vocalizations, it appears as if the vocalization of the rosey-billed pochard is relatively quiet.

==Use by humans==
Rosy-billed pochards are commonly used by humans for consumption, as pets/display animals and even in horticulture. The species, has been indicated as a pest in rice fields, and they experience a large amount of pressure from hunting in Argentina. Not only does this pressure stem from the direct hunting of the birds, but also from lead poisoning. Lead shot is the only available ammunition in Argentina, and investigations into lead toxicosis is still very recent. A 2013 study looking into lead pellet ingestion and tissue levels in ducks from Argentine hunting spots discovered that rosy-billed pochards were more prone to ingesting lead shot than any other duck species they sampled. Rosybills will swallow the lead bullets thinking they are stones, which are required for the mechanical breakdown of food within their gizzard. Not only were the bullets found inside the gizzard, but there were traces of lead concentrations within their bones, which is very toxic and detrimental to the health of the bird. This threat of lead poisoning from hunting has led researches to believe that populations could be declining due to excessive hunting.

Ownership of individuals is relatively accessible and they can be purchased even online.

==Conservation status==
Current population trends show that populations are increasing and are not severely fragmented. There is currently no action recovery plan, however there is a systematic monitoring scheme in place. Conservation sites exist across the entire range of rosybills and they occur in at least one protected area.

<doc id="696886" wikidata="Q4982893" url="?curid=696886" title="Buck Leonard">
<text>Walter Fenner &quot;Buck&quot; Leonard (September 8, 1907 – November 27, 1997) was an American first baseman in Negro league baseball and in the Mexican League. After growing up in North Carolina, he played for the Homestead Grays between 1934 and 1950, batting fourth behind Josh Gibson for many years. The Grays teams of the 1930s and 1940s were considered some of the best teams in Negro league history. Leonard and Gibson are two of only nine players in league history to win multiple batting titles.

Leonard never played in Major League Baseball (MLB); he declined a 1952 offer of an MLB contract because he felt he was too old. Late in life, Leonard worked as a physical education instructor and was the vice-president of a minor league baseball team. He and Gibson were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in . In 1999, he was ranked number 47 on the 100 Greatest Baseball Players list by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Leonard was the brother of fellow Negro leaguer Charlie Leonard. His father worked as a railroad fireman while his mother was a homemaker who cared for the six Leonard children. Leonard&#x27;s parents called him &quot;Buddy&quot;, but his younger brother began mispronouncing it &quot;Bucky&quot;. Family members began calling him &quot;Buck&quot;, a name which stuck with him throughout his life. When Leonard was about seven years old, he would sneak over to the baseball field of the local white team and watch games through the fence. Local police even once arrested Leonard and his friends when they were caught peeking through the fence at the segregated field.

Leonard&#x27;s father died when he was eleven and Leonard picked up jobs after school to help his family. There was no black high school in Rocky Mount, so Leonard finished the eighth grade and went to work shining shoes for a rail station. He also worked in a hosiery mill and for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. He later earned a GED by correspondence. He began playing semiprofessional baseball while working for the railroad, then decided to pursue his living with the sport.

==Negro league career==
He began his Negro league career in 1933 with the Brooklyn Royal Giants, then moved to the legendary Homestead Grays in 1934, the team he played for until his retirement in 1950. The Grays of the late 1930s through the mid-1940s are considered one of the greatest teams of any race ever assembled. The team won nine league pennants in a row during that time.

Leonard batted fourth in their lineup behind Josh Gibson. He led the Negro leagues in batting average in 1948 with a mark of .395, and usually either led the league in home runs or finished second in homers to teammate Gibson. Since Gibson was known as the &quot;Black Babe Ruth&quot; and Leonard was a first baseman, Buck Leonard was inevitably called the &quot;Black Lou Gehrig.&quot; Together, the pair was colloquially known as the &quot;Thunder Twins&quot; or &quot;Dynamite Twins&quot;. In fact, Negro league star Monte Irvin said that if Leonard had been allowed in the major leagues, baseball fans &quot;might have called Lou Gehrig the white Buck Leonard. He was that good.&quot; The Grays disbanded after 1950.

==Mexican League career==
Beginning in 1951, Leonard went to the Mexican League. Teams played three games per week in this league, a pace that worked well for the aging player. Leonard said that he got sick from the water every year that he returned to Mexico, but he otherwise enjoyed the league. For much of his time in Mexico, he was managed by Cuban baseball star Martín Dihigo. Leonard was impressed by Dihigo&#x27;s baseball knowledge. In 1952, Leonard was offered a major league contract, but he believed that at age 45 he was too old and might embarrass himself and hurt the cause of integration. He stayed in Mexico through 1955, playing for teams in Torreón, Xalapa, Durango and Obregón.

== Minor league career ==
In 1953, Leonard made his only appearances in &quot;organized&quot; ball, playing for the unaffiliated Portsmouth Merrimacs of the class B Piedmont League, hitting .333 in 10 games and 46 at bats.

==Later life==

After retiring as a player, Leonard worked as a truant officer, served as a physical education instructor and started a realty company. From 1962 to 1972, he was vice president of the Rocky Mount Leafs and then, from 1973 to 1975, of the Rocky Mount Phillies. The Leafs were a Class A Carolina League farm team for the Detroit Tigers from 1965 to 1972. In 1962 and 1963. the Leafs were a farm club of the Cincinnati Reds and in 1964, the Leafs were a farm club of the Washington Senators. The Phillies were a farm team for the Philadelphia Phillies.

Leonard was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in along with Gibson. At his induction ceremony on August 7 of that year, Leonard said, &quot;We in the Negro leagues felt like we were contributing something to baseball, too, when we were playing. We played with a round ball and we played with a round bat. And we wore baseball shoes and wore baseball uniforms and we thought we were making a contribution to baseball. We loved the game and we liked to play it. If we didn&#x27;t, we wouldn&#x27;t have played because there wasn&#x27;t any money in it.&quot;

Leonard was also inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1974. He suffered a stroke in the 1980s. In , the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Pittsburgh, hometown of the Grays, and the 88-year-old Leonard was named an honorary captain. He appeared wearing a replica of a Grays uniform. Shortly before his death in 1997, Leonard was the subject of a North Carolina General Assembly proclamation recognizing his contributions to baseball. His death late that year stemmed from complications of his earlier stroke.

==Legacy==

In , he ranked Number 47 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, one of five players so honored who played all or most of their careers in the Negro leagues, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Leonard&#x27;s contemporaries, including catcher Roy Campanella and pitcher Dave Barnhill, cited his quick bat as one of his greatest strengths. &quot;You could put a fastball in a shotgun and you couldn&#x27;t shoot it by him,&quot; Barnhill said. Negro league pitcher Leon Day said that he would have rather pitched against Gibson than Leonard. Grays owner Cumberland Posey described Leonard as one of the most talented clutch hitters in the Negro leagues.

He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his &quot;significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot; as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010.

==Career statistics==

===Negro leagues===
The first official statistics for the Negro leagues were compiled as part of a statistical study sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and supervised by Larry Lester and Dick Clark; a research team collected statistics from thousands of boxscores of league-sanctioned games. The first results from this study were the statistics for Negro league Hall of Famers elected prior to 2006, which were published in &quot;Shades of Glory&quot; by Lawrence D. Hogan. These statistics included the official Negro league statistics for Buck Leonard as of 2006.

After seven Negro leagues were declared major leagues in December 2020, Baseball Reference added Negro League statistics compiled by the Seamheads Negro Leagues Database to its website. These statistics include the official Negro major league statistics for Buck Leonard as of 2021.

<doc id="696891" wikidata="Q328370" url="?curid=696891" title="Egbert Benson">
<text>Egbert Benson (June 21, 1746 – August 24, 1833) was an American lawyer, jurist, politician and Founding Father who represented New York State in the Continental Congress, Annapolis Convention, and United States House of Representatives. He served as a member of the New York constitutional convention in 1788 which ratified the United States Constitution. He also served as the first attorney general of New York, chief justice of the New York Supreme Court, and as the chief United States circuit judge of the United States circuit court for the second circuit.

==Education and career==

Benson&#x27;s ancestor, Dirck Benson, who settled in New Amsterdam in 1649, was the founder of the Benson family in America. Egbert Benson was born in New York City in the Province of New York, the son of Robert Benson (1715–1762) and Catherine (Van Borsum) Benson (1718–1794). The Benson family was one of the earliest Dutch families to have settled in Manhattan. In a letter written to Arthur D. Benson, Egbert Benson lived at the corner of Puntine and Fulton streets in the home of William Puntine. His home was one of the centers of cultural life in New York City. Benson lived with his maternal grandmother, a widow who lived on Broad Street, at the corner of Beaver, during the early part of his life.

Benson was taught in Dutch, and he learned his catechism in that language. Upon reaching a suitable age, Benson attended the Collegiate School, a school of repute, and prepared himself for college. During this time, he was guided and assisted by Reverend Doctor Barclay, rector of Trinity Church. He was privately educated, then attended King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University), graduating in 1765. He read law, was admitted to the bar and moved to Red Hook in Dutchess County, New York. He practiced law both there and in New York City. Benson was also honored by Harvard University and Dartmouth College.

A relative of Benson&#x27;s was Benjamin Benson, a Revolutionary War soldier and member of the committee of correspondence. He signed one of the Articles of Association, or &quot;Association Test&quot;, which was preliminary to the Declaration of Independence, at Haverstraw, New York, in May 1775. Egbert Benson was the brother of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Benson and Captain Henry Benson, who commanded an armed vessel in the Revolution.

Benson owned slaves; in the 1790 census, he was recorded as having one slave, and in the 1800 census, two slaves. Despite his personal ownership of slaves, he was involved in the anti-slavery New York Manumission Society.

==Political and judicial service==

Towards the start of the American Revolutionary War, Benson approved the course of the Sons of Liberty and gave up, in a measure, his professional prospects then brightly opening and devoted himself to his country. He aided the Sons of Liberty, who were in Dutchess County where Benson, as a part of his first efforts, gave proper directions to the political meetings. When the British occupied New York City in 1776, Benson remained in Dutchess County for several years. From 1777 to 1781, Benson served as a member of the New York State Assembly and drafted every important bill passed there in during the Revolution. The county made him the president of their committee of safety and in 1777 sent him to the revolutionary New York State Assembly. When the first state government was organized, Benson was appointed the first New York attorney general and served until 1788. He was elected to the Assembly annually until 1781 and again in 1788.

New York sent Benson as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1784. Although he was reappointed in 1785, he did not attend sessions. In 1786, he was named by the Legislature to accompany Alexander Hamilton as a delegate to the Annapolis Convention, which issued a call for the United States Constitutional Convention held the following year. He returned to the Congress in 1787 and 1788, and in 1788 attended the New York state convention that ratified the United States Constitution.

When the new federal government was established, Benson was elected from New York&#x27;s 3rd congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 1st and 2nd United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1793. In 1794, Benson was appointed a justice of the New York Supreme Court, a position he held until 1801.

Benson was part of the three-man commission that decided the location of the St. Croix River in 1798. He was nominated by President John Adams on February 18, 1801, to the United States Circuit Court for the Second Circuit, to the new chief judge seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1801, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on July 1, 1802, due to abolition of the court.

==Later life==

Benson returned to the private practice of law in New York City in 1802. He joined other civic leaders to found the New-York Historical Society and served as its first president from 1804 to 1816. He was the author of several books, including &quot;Vindication of the Captors of Major Andre&quot;, defending the three American Patriots who captured the spy Major John André, which led to the discovery of the plot to surrender West Point to the British by Benedict Arnold.

In 1812, Benson was again elected from New York&#x27;s 2nd congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 13th United States Congress as a Federalist but served only five months before he resigned on August 2, 1813. In December 1813, Benson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

Benson&#x27;s writings include &quot;A Biographical Sketch of Gouverneur Morris&quot; (published in November 1816), and &quot;Brief Remarks on the &#x27;Wife&#x27; of Washington Irving&quot; (published in 1819). Benson also wrote and published in the &quot;New York American&quot; a series of able and highly interesting articles, in condemnation of what he regarded as the absurd and anti-Christian practice of calling the first day of the week the Sabbath.

Benson married late in life, on May 17, 1820, to Maria Conover (1796–1867). He died on August 24, 1833, in Jamaica, Queens, and is buried in the Prospect Cemetery there. His grave has been designated by a historical marker.

==Descendants and legacy==

Egbert&#x27;s oldest brother was clerk of the New York State Senate, Robert Benson (1739–1823), father of his namesake, Egbert Benson.

According to manuscripts and notes found in the Arthur D. Benson manuscript collection at Queens Library, Benson&#x27;s name was engraved on a bronze tablet on the Butterick Building on 6th Avenue and Spring Street in New York City; this tablet was placed there by the Greenwich Village Historical Society. Hevelyn D. Benson, great-grandnephew of Egbert Benson, sent Jerome D. Greene, director of Harvard&#x27;s Trancentanery, seven photostats concerning Egbert Benson. Hevelyn Benson was also a member of the New York Historical Society, founded in 1804 by his ancestor, Egbert Benson. Benson also included a photostat of an article in &quot;The Eagle&quot; from September 16, 1935, which designated Egbert Benson as the man behind the Constitution. The state historical marker for Benson&#x27;s grave was applied to Senator Thomas C. Desmond, a trustee of the New York State Historical Society, by Hevelyn Benson.

<doc id="696894" wikidata="Q235110" url="?curid=696894" title="Chuquisaca Department">
<text>Chuquisaca (); ; ; ) is a department of Bolivia located in the center south. It borders on the departments of Cochabamba, Tarija, Potosí, and Santa Cruz. The departmental capital is Sucre, which is also the constitutional capital of Bolivia.

==Geography==
The department is traversed by the main cordillera of the Andes mountain range and lesser cordilleras. Parts of it lay within the basin of the Amazon River, and other parts within the basin of the Río de La Plata. The surface area of the department is 51,524 square kilometers. The topography of central Chuquisaca consists of a series of ridges rising up to 1500 m that run north and south with flat valleys between the ridges. To the west of these ridges abruptly rise the Andes Mountains to 3000 m forming a prepuna landmass that is cut into by large river valleys that drain into the Amazon or Rio de la Plata river basins. To the east of the central ridges lies a stretch of territory containing low elevation flat Chaco topography. 90% of the land in the department of Chuquisaca has an inclination of 70% or more.

==Demographics==

==Ecological and vegetation zones==
Ecological and vegetation zones in the department of Chuquisaca vary widely according to a diversity of abiotic factors including soil formation and textures, rainfall patterns, and mineral and salinity content of water. Elevation plays an important role in the dispersion of vegetation species and wider ecosystems as they respond to microclimates. As the Andes Mountains became uplifted, plants adapted to dryer and higher microclimates resulting in a high level of speciation especially in the dry forest river valleys of the Bolivian-Tucuman formation. colder and drier air from more austral parts of South America have resulted in migration of plant communities with a floristic connection to those in Argentina, Paraguay and Southern Brazil as opposed to more tropical plant communities that result from warm and moist northern climates. Navarro and Ferreira have developed a database of plant species in Bolivia and identified 39 separate vegetation zones in Bolivia within twelve general physiographic-biogeographical units of which four fall in the boundaries of Chuquisaca Department including: Cordillera Oriental Central y Meridional, Prepuna or High Interandean Valleys, Bolivian-Tucuman Formation, and Chaco. Using Navarro and Ferreira&#x27;s categories and descriptions based on vegetation zones, the geographical and ecological characteristics of the Chuquisaca Department can be described as follows.

Cordillera Oriental Central y Meridional. From an elevation of 3200m in Chuquisaca to nearly 6000 meters in Potosi, this zone is characterized by the puna, altoandean, and subnival and nival ecological zones with a pluviestacional subhumid bioclimate.

Prepuna or High Interandean Valley. From 2300m to 3200m, this zone is characterized by a mesotropical dry xeric bioclimatic zone. Seasonally torrential waters and salinity levels affect regional vegetation patterns in this zone.

Bolivian-Tucuman Formation. With a wide elevation range between 600m to 3900m this zone contains pluviestacional subhumid and locally humid bioclimatic zones. The high elevation Rio Grande and Pilcomayo river valleys transect this unit and are characterized by dry xeric vegetation zones with endemic and varied speciation especially in the Rio Grande river valley and vegetation influence from the Chaco in the Pilcomayo river valley. Wet forest ecosystems like those found in more northern Yungas valleys are found on high ridges where clouds form.

Chaco: from 400 to 900 m this unit is characterized by a xeric bioclimate. Sandy soils in this unit were formed from alluvial processes from the Parapeti and Grande rivers. Soil drainage affects vegetation dispersion within this unit.

==Human Ecological Impacts==
With a human population of 631,000 people humans are a part of the ecology of Chuquisaca. The grazing of cattle and introduction of invasive feral citrus trees has affected the native plant populations in the department. Native forests and ecosystems have contracted as land has been converted to pasture and erosion is widespread as a result of human agricultural activities on steep slopes.

==Government==
===Executive offices===
The chief executive office of Bolivia departments (since May 2010) is the governor; until then, the office was called the prefect, and until 2006 the prefect was appointed by the president of Bolivia. The current governor, Damián Condori Herrera, member of the CST, was elected on 7 March 2021.

===Legislative Assembly===
Under the 2009 Constitution, each Bolivian department has an elected Departmental Legislative Assembly. The first elections were held 4 April 2010. The majority party in the twenty-one member assembly after the first election was held by the Movement towards Socialism (MAS-IPSP) with 15 seats. Four seats were held by We Are All Chuquisaca. Two seats were selected by the Guaraní people through &quot;usos y costumbres&quot;.

The last elections to the Departmental Legislative Assembly took place on 1 March 2021 for seats reserved for the Guaraní people and 7 March for the regular seats. The current executive committee, elected on 28 April 2022, consists of Santos Ricardo Carnicel Serrano as president, Evert Cruz Quiroga as first vice-president, Janeth Rocio Blanco Martínez as second vice-president, Juan Cuellar as first secretary and Anastacio Flores Pinto as second secretary.

===Provinces===
The department is divided into 10 provinces which are further subdivided into municipalities and cantons.

==History==
The native inhabitants were the Charcas, who were dispersed along riverbanks and lowlands. Their leaders, &quot;jampiris&quot;, sorcerers, and priests resided in the capital, Choque-Chaca, which according to 17th century chronicles had a population of several thousand.

===Sucre===
Sucre (elev. 2750 m) is called the city of the four names, each name corresponding to a different period of its history. It was founded by the Spaniard Pedro de Anzures in 1538. It thrived due to its regional proximity to the famous silver mines of Potosi, and as &quot;Charcas&quot; served as capital of the Real Audiencia de Charcas, encompassing all of current Bolivia&#x27;s territory and more. Reverting to its native name of Chuquisaca, it was the Upper Peru&#x27;s chief administrative center and largest city. It was there that the first public call for independence from Spain took place, on May 25, 1809, and where the Act of Independence from Spanish rule was signed on August 6, 1825. It was immediately designated the capital of independent Bolivia, under the auspices of Simon Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre. Years later, the city of Chuquisaca was renamed Sucre in honor of the Venezuelan-born hero of South America&#x27;s independence, who had served as the first effective administrator of the country (and second president).

When the center of political and economic power shifted north, to the tin-producing regions of Oruro and La Paz, Sucre&#x27;s importance waned, leading to the displacement of the legislative and executive powers to La Paz. However, in honor of Sucre&#x27;s historical preponderance, the judicial branch (Supreme Court) continues to operate there, and the city&#x27;s official status as capital of the country was never revoked.

== Languages ==
The languages spoken in the department are mainly Spanish and Quechua. The following table shows the number of those belonging to the recognized group of speakers.

<doc id="696897" wikidata="Q233917" url="?curid=696897" title="Cochabamba Department">
<text>Cochabamba (, , ), from Quechua &quot;qucha&quot; or &quot;qhucha&quot;, meaning &quot;lake&quot;, &quot;pampa&quot; meaning &quot;plain&quot;, is one of the nine departments of Bolivia. It is known to be the &quot;granary&quot; of the country because of its variety of agricultural products from its geographical position. It has an area of 55,631 km2. Its population in the 2024 census was 2,005,373. Its capital is the city of Cochabamba, known as the &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot; and &quot;The Garden City&quot; because of its spring-like temperatures all year.

==History==
The Cochabamba valley has been inhabited for over a thousand years due to its fertile productive soils and climate. Archaeological evidence suggests that the initial valley inhabitants were of various ethnic indigenous groups. Tiwanaku, Tupuraya, Mojocoya, Omereque and Inca inhabited the valley at various times before the Spanish arrived.

The first Spanish inhabitant of the Valley was Garci Ruiz de Orellana in 1542. He purchased the majority of the land from local tribal chiefs Achata and Consavana through a title registered in 1552 at the Imperial City of Potosí. The price paid was 130 pesos. His residence, known as the House of Mayorazgo, still stands in the Cala Cala neighbourhood of the city.

The city, called Villa de Oropesa was founded on 2 August 1571 by order of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa. It was to be an agricultural production centre to provide food for the mining towns of the relatively nearby Altiplano region, particularly the city of Potosí which became one of the largest and richest cities in the world during the 17th century – funding the vast wealth that ultimately made Spain a world power at the time. With the silver mining industry in Potosi at its height, Cochabamba thrived during its first centuries of existence. The city entered a period of decline during the 18th century as mining began to wane.

In 1786, King Charles III of Spain renamed the city to the &#x27;loyal and valiant&#x27; Villa of Cochabamba. This was done to commend the city&#x27;s pivotal role in suppressing the indigenous rebellions of 1781 in Oruro by sending armed forces to Oruro to quell the uprisings. Since the late 19th century it has again been generally successful as an agricultural centre for Bolivia.

The 1793 census shows that the city had a population of 22,305 persons. There were 12,980 mestizos, 6,368 Spaniards, 1,182 indigenous natives, 1,600 mulattos and 175 African slaves.

In 2000, Cochabamba was wracked by large-scale protests over the privatisation of the city&#x27;s water supply, known as the Water War.

In January 2007 city dwellers clashed with mostly rural protestors, leaving four dead and over 130 injured. The democratically elected Prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, a former military aide to the Luis García Meza dictatorship of the 1980s, had allied himself with the leaders of Bolivia&#x27;s eastern departments in a dispute with President Evo Morales over regional autonomy and other political issues. The protestors blockaded the highways, bridges, and main roads, having days earlier set fire to the departmental seat of government, trying to force the resignation of Reyes Villa. Citizens attacked the protestors, breaking the blockade and routing them, while the police did little to stop the violence. Further attempts by the protestors to reinstate the blockade and threaten the government were unsuccessful, but the underlying tensions have not been resolved.

In July 2007, a monument erected by veterans of January&#x27;s protest movement in honour of those killed and injured by government supporters was destroyed in the middle of the night, reigniting racial conflicts in the city.

In August 2008, a nationwide referendum was held, and while President Evo Morales had 67% support in Bolivia, the Prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, was not confirmed by the voters of the department.

In 2018 Cochabamba hosted the 2018 South American Games ODESUR.

Around 74% of Cochabambinos identify as indigenous, while most of the remaining population is mestizo.

==Geography==

Cochabamba Department is bordered by Chuquisaca and Potosi Departments to the south, Oruro and La Paz Departments to the west, Beni Department to the north, and Santa Cruz Department to the east. The borders are formed mainly by rivers, like Ichilo to the east, Rio Grande to the south and Cotacajes to the west.

Geographically and climatically, Cochabamba is one of Bolivia&#x27;s most diverse regions, with a similar orography and diversity to La Paz department. Cochabamba is made up of a variety of regions. The northern portions of the department, known as the Chapare, is a region of moist Southwestern Amazonian moist forests with high levels of precipitation between 2,000mm and 7,000mm a year. This region is marked by steep hills and mountains at the edge of the Central Andes descending into the flat floodplains of the Llanos de Moxos to the north of Cochabamba. Further east of this region is a transition zone between the Tropical Wet-and-Dry forests of Santa Cruz and the Chapare, where Monsoonal climates predominate with an average annual precipitation between 1,800mm and 3,000mm.

South of the Tropical lowlands of Cochabamba lies a thin band of montane cloud forests that run slightly southeast from north to south in Cochabamba. This region features an unusual subtropical highland climate and Oceanic climate, with precipitation year-round, with some drying periods. Precipitation in this region ranges between 1,000mm and 2,500mm.

The center of the department is marked by the temperate xeric valleys of Cochabamba (known as Kanata), Alto Cochabamba, and Capinota. These valley areas are marked by dry montane forests, and semi-arid orographies. Temperate climates year-round feature considerable diurnal temperature variation due to the high altitude. A majority of the department&#x27;s population lives in this area, where major cities are located like Cochabamba, Cliza, Punata, Sacaba, Quillacollo, Arani, Santivańez, Capinota, Irpa Irpa, among others.

Surrounding the smaller valleys of the department&#x27;s center from the west to the east, is a region of Andean highlands, featuring a subtropical highland climate, with annual precipitation averaging between 400mm and 1,400mm. This region of rocky valleys and moderately sized mountains features mosaics of high altitude forests and agricultural heartland. This region features dramatic and diverse geographies, with a considerable historical and archaeological importance.

To the southeast of the highlands of Cochabamba, are semi-arid valleys and mountains terminating at the banks of the Wapaymayu or Río Grande. This area, famous for its cultural history, is marked by dry valleys and mountains, with agricultural lands bordering rivers throughout the region. Precipitation in this region is generally sparse, oscillating between 300mm and 600mm per year, bordering on a Desert climate

To the extreme southwest, is a small tract of Puna which features a cold Tundra climate, with unusual subpolar oceanic characteristics. Precipitation in this area ranges between 300mm and 650mm per year.

==Government==

===Executive offices===
Since May 2010, the chief executive officer of Bolivia departments has been the governor; before then, the officer was called the prefect, and until 2006, the prefect was appointed by the president of Bolivia. The current governor, Humberto Sánchez of the Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (MAS–IPSP) was elected on 7 March 2021 and took office on 4 May.

The MAS–IPSP has been the dominant political party in the department since the 2008 recall referendum. 

===Legislative Assembly===

Under the 2009 Constitution, Bolivian departments have an elected legislature, the Departmental Legislative Assembly. The Cochabamba Assembly has 34 members including two indigenous representatives. The first elections were held 4 April 2010 and the current composition was determined at the regional election on 7 March 2021.

The current executive committee, elected on 3 May 2022, consists of Elena Aine Espinoza as president, Francisco Otalora Ticona as first vice-president, Pedro Andrés Badran Leon as second vice-president and Julieta Veizaga Guevara as first secretary.

== Subdivisions ==
=== Provinces ===
Cochabamba Department is divided into 16 provinces (), which are further subdivided into 47 municipalities () and – on the fourth level – into 144 cantons.

The provinces with their capitals and population according to census 2012 are listed as follow:

=== Regions ===
The municipalities in Cochabamba Department can also be grouped informally into large regions. Provinces are not subsumed under regions, which have rather different borders. The five regions are:
* Región Andina (): the cordilleras in the west, part of the Altiplano.
* Cono Sur (), a cone-shaped (vaguely triangular) corner in the southeast.
* Región Metropolitana: the department&#x27;s most populous region, centered around the capital city, Cochabamba
* Trópico (el Trópico de Cochabamba): the department&#x27;s largest region, including Chimoré, Colomi, Entre Rios, Puerto Villarroel, Shinahota, Villa Tunari, and part of the 
* Valles (): south of Metropolitana.

==Languages==
The languages spoken in Cochabamba Department are mainly Spanish and Quechua. The following table shows the number of those belonging to the recognised group of speakers.

==Population and demographics==

==Religion== 
Cochabamba is home to a diverse amount of religious adherents, with 42% identifying as Catholics, 32% as Evangelical Christians, 0.67% as Muslims, and the remaining 27% as identifying with either no religion or other religions.

==Economy==
The Cochabamba economy is based mainly in services, but recently it is experiencing some diversification in manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. 
The geographic location of Cochabamba makes it the main routes of transport joining the two main cities, the host government La Paz and the industrial hub Santa Cruz. Therefore, many cervices i.e. transport, banking, telecommunication, gastronomy, are economically important in the corridor La Paz – Santa Cruz.
Extraction of oil was very important for the economy in the past; especially in Chapare where the wells are located. By 2013 many of the exploited wells were showing signs of depletion. Thus, investment is needed to find new productive wells.
Once called “the basket grain of Bolivia” today Cochabamba produces just a portion of the agriculture output of the country. Overpopulation in the productive valleys and “minifundio” doomed the once competitive production. Nevertheless, Cochabamba is still important in poultry, dairy, tropical fruits, potatoes, among others.
Recently, Cochabamba experiences some improvement in manufacturing and industry. The cement mill of COBOCE located in Capinota almost triples the production tapering the strong demand. The roads to the industrial park and other facilities of the park were improved making it more competitive for the local and new industries. Also, it is worth to mention the almost 1b USD government investment in the petro chemistry (urea plant) located in Bulo Bulo.

<text>Beckton is the eastern terminus of the Beckton branch of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the Docklands area of east London. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==
When the London Docks and Beckton Gasworks were active, they were served by a railway system. A separate station known as Beckton existed on this earlier network, several hundred yards east of Beckton DLR station, until its closure in December 1940.

In 1973, a government report on the redevelopment of London&#x27;s Docklands proposed an extension of the unbuilt Fleet line from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Beckton. The proposal was developed during the 1970s as the Fleet line developed into the Jubilee line. The route was approved in 1980 with the main route running via Custom House and Silvertown to Woolwich Arsenal. Beckton would have been the terminus of a branch line operated as a shuttle service from Custom House. Financial constraints meant that the route was not proceeded with. By the start of the 1990s new plans had been developed to extend the Jubilee line on a route south of the River Thames towards Stratford.

The DLR branch from Poplar was opened on 28 March 1994. The station was originally in Travelcard Zone 4 and was moved to Zone 2/3 in January 2000.

==Location==
The next station is Gallions Reach, but between the two stations the line curves through 180 degrees, such that westbound trains for Central London depart Beckton heading east. Beckton station is located north and slightly further west of Cyprus, the station after Gallions Reach. During peak hours, trains from Beckton depart for Tower Gateway and Bank. Off-peak, trains alternate between Tower Gateway and Canning Town station.

Beckton DLR depot, the principal depot for the DLR system, is located between Beckton and Gallions Reach stations, but is closer to the latter.

Like all open-air DLR stations, Beckton is unmanned and tickets are bought at the ticket machines. New machines were installed in January 2009 that now allow Oyster card users to top-up their pre-pay balance and see their journey history. During 2007–2008, a new bus station was constructed directly opposite the DLR station. This opened in the first week of November 2008.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Beckton is:
* 12 tph to of which 6 continue to Tower Gateway

Additional services run to and from the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction.


==Connections==
There is a bus station directly in front of the station offering services right across East London.

<doc id="696899" wikidata="Q1862440" url="?curid=696899" title="List of Icelandic writers">
<text>Iceland has a rich literary history, which has carried on into the modern period.

Some of the best known examples of Icelandic literature are the Sagas of Icelanders. These are prose narratives based on historical events that took place in Iceland and the surrounding areas during the Saga Age. Most of these sagas were recorded during the 13th and 14th centuries, but the original authors and subsequent recorders of the works are unknown and thus not listed here. Although it has been suggested that Snorri Sturluson is the author of &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;. The Saga tradition is not limited only to Iceland, and is an integral part of Norse mythology throughout the Nordics.

Another dominant form of Icelandic literature is poetry. Iceland has a rich history of poets, with many poets listed here. The early poetry of Iceland is Old Norse poetry, which is divided into the anonymous Eddic poetry, and the Skaldic poetry attributed to a series of skalds, who were court poets who lived in the Viking Age and Middle Ages. The modern Icelandic language is sufficiently similar to the Old Norse language for speakers of modern Icelandic to be able to understand Old Norse texts. Later Icelandic poetry includes the &quot;Passion Hymns&quot; by Hallgrímur Pétursson, a collection of Christian religious poetry published in 1666. Modern poets include Einar Benediktsson, a neo-Romantic poet who was an important figure in Iceland&#x27;s nationalistic literary revival during the 19th century, and 20th-century poets such as Tómas Guðmundsson and Davíð Stefánsson.

Halldór Laxness is the only Icelander to have been awarded the Nobel Prize. Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955, he is recognized as one of Iceland&#x27;s greatest literary figures. He wrote poetry, newspaper articles, plays, travelogues, short stories, and novels. Icelandic authors have won the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize nine times.

In the modern period many Icelandic authors have been successful writing in languages other than Icelandic. Others have their work translated into other languages and are known internationally. The Detective Erlendur series by crime fiction author Arnaldur Indriðason is translated into at least 24 languages, including English.

Following is a list of notable Icelandic writers. This list includes authors of Icelandic literature, as well as writers in other literary disciplines; such as authors of fiction and non-fiction works, poets and skalds, playwrights, screenwriters, songwriters and composers, scholars, scribes, journalists, translators, and editors of newspapers and magazines. All the people listed here are or were Icelandic citizens, or writers with a strong connection to Iceland, for example by writing in the Icelandic language. People listed are from a wide range of time periods, ranging from the early Viking-age chroniclers, to modern day novelists. To help sort the writers by period, they are sorted according to the time period they lived. Although many more precise periods can be used, this list uses &quot;Contemporary&quot; for living writers, &quot;Modern&quot; for writers since the 16th century, and &quot;Medieval&quot; for the period from the 5th to the 15th century. In keeping with Icelandic naming conventions, the list is alphabetical by given name, as that is how Icelandic names are sorted.

<text>Richard Beresford (June 3, 1755 – February 6, 1803) was an American planter and lawyer from Berkeley County, South Carolina. He was a delegate for South Carolina in the Confederation Congress in 1783 and 1784.

Beresford was born near Charleston, South Carolina and was baptized June 3, 1755. He was educated in South Carolina and in England, studying law at the Middle Temple in London. He became a lawyer in private practice and also engaged in planting, with extensive estates in Berkeley County and Colleton County in South Carolina as well as in England.

He took an active part in the American Revolutionary War, serving as an officer in the 1st South Carolina Regiment under General Isaac Huger in the Georgia campaign in 1778. He was captured at the fall of Charleston in 1780 and imprisoned at St. Augustine until 1781, when he was exchanged. He was member of the South Carolina state house of representatives, 1781 and was elected by the South Carolina state general assembly as a member of the privy council in 1782. He was elected the ninth Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina in January 1783, but resigned shortly afterward, having been elected to the Continental Congress. He was a member of the Confederation Congress in 1783 and 1784, after which he resumed planting. He later engaged in literary pursuits and published the &quot;Vigil in Charleston&quot; in 1798. He died in Charleston.

The Confederation Congress had scheduled to meet at the Maryland State House in November, 1783, to ratify the Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War. However, by mid-January only seven of the thirteen states had sent delegates, which was not enough to ratify the treaty. On January 13, 1784, Beresford, who was ill, was the last delegate to arrive. Soon after his arrival, the vote was taken and on January 14, the Congress ratified the treaty.

<doc id="696905" wikidata="Q235362" url="?curid=696905" title="Pando Department">
<text>Pando is a department in Northern Bolivia, with an area of , in the Amazon Rainforest, adjoining the border with Brazil and Perú. Pando has a population of 130,761 (2024 census). Its capital is the city of Cobija.

The department, named after former president José Manuel Pando (1899–1905), is divided into five provinces.

Although Pando is rich in natural resources, the poverty level of its inhabitants is high, due largely to the lack of roads effectively linking the province to the rest of the country. In addition, residents suffer from debilitating effects of tropical diseases, typical of life in the Amazonian rain forest. The main economic activities are agriculture, timber, and cattle.

At an altitude of 280 metres above sea level in the northwestern jungle region, Pando is located in the rainiest part of Bolivia. Pando has a hot climate, with temperatures commonly above 26 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit).

Pando is the least populous department in Bolivia, the most tropical (lying closest to the Equator in the Amazonian Basin), and the most isolated, due to an absence of effective roads. It was organized at the beginning of the 20th century from what was left of the Acre Territory, lost to Brazil as a result of the so-called Acre War (1903). Its capital city of Cobija (the smallest of all the Bolivian departmental capitals) was named after the much-lamented Bolivian port of the same name on the Pacific Ocean, part of an area lost to Chile following the War of the Pacific.

Although remote, Pando is densely forested and close to navigable waterways leading to the Amazon River and from there on to the Atlantic Ocean. The department had a rubber boom in the late 19th century and early 20th century, along with the northern part of the nearby Beni department. The local industry collapsed under competition with rubber cultivated in Southeast Asia, as well as the discovery and manufacture of synthetic rubber.

Culturally, the Pandinos are considered part of the so-called Camba culture of the Bolivian lowlands, similar to the people of the country&#x27;s other two tropical departments, Beni and Santa Cruz. Many of Pando&#x27;s original settlers moved from nearby Beni.

==Autonomy movement==
Far from the centers of power in Bolivian society, Pando has recently linked its fate with that of Santa Cruz and Beni, which (along with Tarija and Chuquisaca) are demanding increased autonomy for the departments, with a lessening in central government power. Prefect Leopoldo Fernández strongly backed autonomy for the department, in alliance with other governors of the eastern &quot;media luna&quot; (half-moon, so known for their combined geographic shape). Nationwide referendums on autonomy held on July 2, 2006, were approved in all four departments. A second referendum to approve a statute of autonomy was held by each department in mid-2008, despite being declared illegal by the National Electoral Court in March. Left-wing and pro-Morales social movements boycotted the votes.

Pando&#x27;s referendum, held on June 1, 2008, won 82% approval among those who voted. But 46.5% of the registered electorate did not vote, the highest abstention rate in the four departments holding such referendums. Considerable social unrest took place in 2008, culminating with the arrest in September 2008 of Prefect Leopoldo Fernández, stemming from the massacre at El Porvenir of anti-autonomy backers of President Evo Morales.

==Government==
===Executive offices===
The chief executive office of Bolivia departments (since May 2010) is the governor; until then, the office was called the prefect, and until 2006 the prefect was appointed by the President of Bolivia. The current governor, Regis Germán Richter of the MTS was elected on 11 April 2021 after winning the second round of the regional election.

===Legislative Assembly===
Under the 2009 Constitution, a Departmental Legislative Assembly was instituted for each Bolivian department. The first elections hereunto were held on 4 April 2010. The legislature has 21 members. Its current composition, per the last regional election, is 13 seats for the MAS-IPSP, 3 for indigenous representatives, 2 for the Democratic Integration Community and one each for MTS, &quot;Movimiento Democrático Autonomista&quot; and We Are All Pando.

The current executive committee was determined per vote on 2 May 2022, selecting Olga Feliciano Ampuero as president, Almir Flores Muzumbite as vice-president, Josué Olmos Quetehuari as secretary and Keila Tirina Peralta and Georgina Ribero Chao as first and second committee member, respectively.

<doc id="696908" wikidata="Q1770259" url="?curid=696908" title="Mark Lane tube station">
<text>Mark Lane is a disused station on the London Underground. It was served by the Circle and District lines. 

In 1946 it was renamed Tower Hill. It was closed in 1967 and the present Tower Hill station was opened as its replacement, located on the same site as the Tower of London station that had closed in 1884.

It was named after Mark Lane, the street on which it is located, slightly west of the current Tower Hill station that replaced it in 1967.

==History==

Mark Lane station was opened on 6 October 1884 to replace the short-lived Tower of London station, which was closed when the Metropolitan Railway and District Railway were connected to form the Circle line and a larger station was required. 
The station was referred to in early plans as Trinity Square, and later named Seething Lane, but it was ultimately given the more recognisable name Mark Lane (the street on which London&#x27;s Corn Exchanges were located). On 1 September 1946, the station was renamed Tower Hill.

The station was earmarked for closure due to overwhelming passenger numbers and little space available for expansion. It was closed on 4 February 1967 and the present Tower Hill station was opened as its replacement, located on the same site as the Tower of London station that had closed in 1884.

The underground section of Mark Lane station can still be seen between Monument and Tower Hill, though only one platform on the eastbound track now remains due to redevelopment of the track. The surface station, sited in Seething Lane, can be seen in the form of a pedestrian subway under the road converted from the old station overbridge, where large white grilles now cover the original stairways down to the platforms.

The offices above the station were called Mark Lane Station Buildings, and this sign can still be read above an entrance on Byward Street.

==In fiction==
The disused station features in the 2017 novel &quot;Who Sent Clement&quot; by Keith A. Pearson as the fictional hiding place for a gold bar from the 1971 Baker Street robbery. The loot is made as a pay-off to a look-out from the robbery, a former ticket office manager of the then recently closed station.

<doc id="696911" wikidata="Q2253702" url="?curid=696911" title="Interaction energy">
<text>In physics, interaction energy is the contribution to the total energy that is caused by an interaction between the objects being considered.

The interaction energy usually depends on the relative position of the objects. For example, formula_1 is the electrostatic interaction energy between two objects with charges formula_2, formula_3.

==Interaction energy==
A straightforward approach for evaluating the interaction energy is to calculate the difference between the objects&#x27; combined energy and all of their isolated energies. In the case of two objects, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the interaction energy can be written as:

formula_4
where formula_5 and formula_6 are the energies of the isolated objects (monomers), and formula_7 the energy of their interacting assembly (dimer).

For larger system, consisting of &quot;N&quot; objects, this procedure can be generalized to provide a total many-body interaction energy:

formula_8

By calculating the energies for monomers, dimers, trimers, etc., in an N-object system, a complete set of two-, three-, and up to N-body interaction energies can be derived.

The supermolecular approach has an important disadvantage in that the final interaction energy is usually much smaller than the total energies from which it is calculated, and therefore contains a much larger relative uncertainty. In the case where energies are derived from quantum chemical calculations using finite atom-centered basis functions, basis set superposition errors can also contribute some degree of artificial stabilization.

<text>A bound state is a composite of two or more fundamental building blocks, such as particles, atoms, or bodies, that behaves as a single object and in which energy is required to split them.

In quantum physics, a bound state is a quantum state of a particle subject to a potential such that the particle has a tendency to remain localized in one or more regions of space. The potential may be external or it may be the result of the presence of another particle; in the latter case, one can equivalently define a bound state as a state representing two or more particles whose interaction energy exceeds the total energy of each separate particle. One consequence is that, given a potential vanishing at infinity, negative-energy states must be bound. The energy spectrum of the set of bound states are most commonly discrete, unlike scattering states of free particles, which have a continuous spectrum.

Although not bound states in the strict sense, metastable states with a net positive interaction energy, but long decay time, are often considered unstable bound states as well and are called &quot;quasi-bound states&quot;. Examples include radionuclides and Rydberg atoms.

In relativistic quantum field theory, a stable bound state of particles with masses formula_1 corresponds to a pole in the S-matrix with a center-of-mass energy less than formula_2. An unstable bound state shows up as a pole with a complex center-of-mass energy.

==Examples==

*A proton and an electron can move separately; when they do, the total center-of-mass energy is positive, and such a pair of particles can be described as an ionized atom. Once the electron starts to &quot;orbit&quot; the proton, the energy becomes negative, and a bound state – namely the hydrogen atom – is formed. Only the lowest-energy bound state, the ground state, is stable. Other excited states are unstable and will decay into stable (but not other unstable) bound states with less energy by emitting a photon.
*A positronium &quot;atom&quot; is an unstable bound state of an electron and a positron. It decays into photons.
*Any state in the quantum harmonic oscillator is bound, but has positive energy. Note that formula_3 , so the below does not apply.
*A nucleus is a bound state of protons and neutrons (nucleons).
*The proton itself is a bound state of three quarks (two up and one down; one red, one green and one blue). However, unlike the case of the hydrogen atom, the individual quarks can never be isolated. See confinement.
*The Hubbard and Jaynes–Cummings–Hubbard (JCH) models support similar bound states. In the Hubbard model, two repulsive bosonic atoms can form a bound pair in an optical lattice. The JCH Hamiltonian also supports two-polariton bound states when the photon-atom interaction is sufficiently strong.

==Definition==

Let -finite measure space formula_4 be a probability space associated with separable complex Hilbert space formula_5. Define a one-parameter group of unitary operators formula_6, a density operator formula_7 and an observable formula_8 on formula_5. Let formula_10 be the induced probability distribution of formula_8 with respect to formula_12. Then the evolution
:formula_13 
is bound with respect to formula_8 if 
:formula_15, 
where formula_16.

A quantum particle is in a bound state if at no point in time it is found “too far away&quot; from any finite region formula_17. Using a wave function representation, for example, this means
:formula_18
such that
:formula_19 bound wavefunction ordered according to increasing energy has exactly formula_20 nodes, i.e., points formula_21 where formula_22. Due to the form of Schrödinger&#x27;s time independent equations, it is not possible for a physical wavefunction to have formula_23 since it corresponds to formula_24 solution.

==Requirements==

A boson with mass mediating a weakly coupled interaction produces an Yukawa-like interaction potential,

:formula_25,

where formula_26, is the gauge coupling constant, and is the reduced Compton wavelength. A scalar boson produces a universally attractive potential, whereas a vector attracts particles to antiparticles but repels like pairs. For two particles of mass and , the Bohr radius of the system becomes

:formula_27 

and yields the dimensionless number

:formula_28.

In order for the first bound state to exist at all, formula_29. Because the photon is massless, {{math|&quot;D&quot;}} is infinite for electromagnetism. For the weak interaction, the Z boson&#x27;s mass is {{val|91.1876|0.0021|u=GeV/c2}}, which prevents the formation of bound states between most particles, as it is {{val|97.2|u=times}} the proton&#x27;s mass and {{val|178,000|u=times|fmt=commas}} the electron&#x27;s mass.

Note, however, that, if the Higgs interaction did not break electroweak symmetry at the electroweak scale, then the SU(2) weak interaction would become confining.

<doc id="696914" wikidata="Q257015" url="?curid=696914" title="Archduchess Louise of Austria">
<text>Archduchess Louise of Austria (2 September 1870, in Salzburg – 23 March 1947, in Brussels) was by marriage Crown Princess of Saxony as the wife of the future King Frederick Augustus III.

Louise was born in Salzburg to the exiled Grand Duke of Tuscany and his second wife, Alice grew up in a relatively informal household. At the age of seventeen she began to attract suitors, but ended up choosing the crown prince of Saxony, Frederick Augustus, and they married in 1891. 

Upon arriving in Dresden, she soon found herself despising the strict and overbearing rules of Saxon court life, which brought her into conflicts with her Wettin in-laws. However, Louise was not infertile and gave birth to six children in eleven years, five surviving, which increased her popularity among the Saxon people. Her unhappiness with her husband caused her to have affairs, and her father-in-law threatened to lock her up in an asylum. Whilst pregnant with her sixth child, Maria Alix, she fled Dresden to Lake Geneva, where her brother was meeting her. This scandal was extremely damaging to the Saxon royal family, since they were very devout Catholics. 

The Saxon king dissolved their union in 1903 and a year later, she was barred from returning to Saxony. She first lived with her lover, giving birth to a daughter who was officially the daughter of Frederick, until late 1903 when they separated. In 1907, Louise married again to the Italian musician, Enrico Toselli but this union only produced one child and they divorced in 1912. Following this, she relied on the charity of her wealthy Habsburg family, but when Austria-Hungary collapsed in 1918 Louise lost this income and largely fell into poverty. She died as a flower seller in 1947. 

==Life==

===Crown Princess of Saxony===
Louise was born on 2 September 1870, the second child of Ferdinand IV, the last Grand Duke of Tuscany and his second wife, Princess Alice of Bourbon-Parma. Through her mother, she was a great-great-granddaughter of Charles X of France.

At 17 she attracted the attention of potential suitors, among them Prince Pedro Augusto of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (grandson of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil) or Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria, but none appealed to her. In the summer of 1887 at Pillnitz Castle she met Prince Frederick Augustus of Saxony (eldest son of Prince George, who became king of Saxony in June 1902). They married at Vienna on 21 November 1891, in a lavish ceremony which cost the groom the sum of 20,000 marks. In return, Louise fulfilled her royal duties, and bore him six children; however, she did not follow etiquette at the strict Dresden court, which resulted in arguments with her father-in-law, the Interior Minister Georg von Metzsch-Reichenbach, and her sister-in-law Princess Mathilde.

As her popularity among the people by far exceeded that of the rest of the Saxon Royal Family, they made her life difficult with big and small intrigues. Soon rumors began to circulate that Louise had had an affair with a dentist named O&#x27;Brian and with her children&#x27;s French tutor, André Giron. In desperation, she sent a telegram to Giron, which was intercepted by the secret police and it turned out that she had actually begun an affair with him. This was discussed by her biographer Erika Bestenreiner, who described the French tutor as a slender black-haired man with a small dark mustache, of a lively nature, with perfect manners and good taste in clothes.

===Scandal===
Threatened by her father-in-law with being interned in a mental asylum at the Sonnenstein Castle for life, on 9 December 1902 and with the help of two of her maids, sisters Sidonie and Maria Beeger – daughters of the royal court architect Eduard Beeger – Louise (pregnant with her seventh child) fled from Dresden towards Lake Geneva, where André Giron was waiting for her. At first, in the Saxon court, it was believed that this trip was for recreation, but she had arranged to meet her elder brother Archduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria, who had begun a liaison with (and shortly after married) Wilhelmine Adamović, a prostitute and daughter of a postman. Three days after their arrival, the Beeger sisters left Geneva. In the meantime, André Giron (who was with Louise&#x27;s brother) contacted a notary in Brussels to lay a false trail to the Belgian capital. However, the siblings were identified at Geneva a few days later.

The escape of the Crown Princess of Saxony was the first scandal of the German nobility in the 20th century, especially hurtful for the staunchly Catholic Saxon Royal Family. The conservative Baroness Hildegard von Spitzemberg noted in her diary:

Hermione von Preuschen, on the other hand, answered the “Louise Question” put to several women writers by the Neues Wiener Journal as follows:

Alice Gurschner said simply:

Without consulting his son, King George of Saxony officially declared the civil divorce of the Crown Princely couple on 11 February 1903 by a special court, which he had set up on 31 December 1902. One year later, on 15 October 1904, the Saxon monarch died after forcing his son, the new King Frederick Augustus III, to bar her from returning to the Dresden court. In Geneva, the former Crown Princess led a happy life and even dared to show up with her lover in public, but unexpectedly a few days before the divorce was declared she separated from Giron for unknown reasons.

The paternity of her daughter Anna Monika Pia, born on 4 May 1903 at Lindau remained unclear. The Saxon court sent the director of the Dresden maternity hospital, Dr. Leopold, to Lindau to examine her and establish her true parentage. Due to her physical appearance and the bright colour of eyes and hair, he declared that the Crown Prince was her father, but refused to admit further medical opinions. She was therefore recognized by Frederick Augustus as his own. King George gave Louise an allowance and granted her the title of Countess of Montignoso (in allusion of her Tuscan ascendancy) on 13 July 1903; in turn, he demanded that Anna Monika Pia be sent to Dresden to be raised with the other royal children, but Louise adamantly refused.

===Later life===
Louise lived firstly at Ramo Castle near Lyon, then in 1903 at Ventnor Castle on the Isle of Wight. In 1904 she and her family moved to the Bourbon-Parma family seat of Wartegg Castle on Lake Constance, and later to Florence. On 21 December 1904 she tried to see her older children at the Dresden Taschenbergpalais, but her attempts were unsuccessful because the police had surrounded the building. Later, she traveled in the company of her new lover, Conte Carlo Guicciardi, who lived separately from his wife but was still married.

Both Louise and her lover thought to return 2-year-old Anna Monika Pia to the Saxon court, but after an increase of the child&#x27;s allowance from 30,000 to 40,000 marks was negotiated Louise changed her mind and refused to send her daughter to Dresden.

In London on 25 September 1907 Louise married the Italian musician Enrico Toselli, 12 years younger than she. They had one son, Carlo Emmanuele Filiberto, born on 7 May 1908. Shortly after her wedding (26 October 1907), King Frederick Augustus III finally located Anna Monika Pia, who was sent to Dresden to live with her siblings and be raised as a member of the Saxon royal house. In 1908 Louise separated from Toselli, and they divorced in 1912; their son remained with his father.
In 1911, Louise broke her silence and published a memoir blaming her disgrace on her late father-in-law and Saxon politicians, who she claimed feared that, when she became queen, she would use her influence to dismiss them from office. Throughout the book, &quot;My Own Story&quot;, she claimed that her popularity exceeded that of her father-in-law, King George of Saxony, and her husband, the future king. Louise implied that her popularity had alienated her from the royal family and politicians. She was indeed popular with the Saxon people. She ascribed her popularity to her insistence on ignoring the etiquette of the Saxon court and, perhaps to cast herself as a victim, compared herself with her Habsburg relative, Marie Antoinette, who disliked court rituals at Versailles and, like Louise, had avoided the noble courtiers who depended on those rituals to affirm their places at court.

After the Habsburg monarchy collapsed in 1918, Louise called herself &quot;Antoinette Maria, Comtesse d&#x27;Ysette&quot;; after some time in Mallorca with her uncle Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria, she moved to Brussels, where she initially lived in the suburb of Ixelles. Stripped of her imperial titles and dignities after her second marriage, she could no longer bear the surname of Habsburg. After the German invasion ended the little support that she received from some relatives, she suddenly became penniless. She died in poverty as a flower seller on 23 March 1947. Her urn was deposited in the Hedingen monastery in Sigmaringen, the burial place of the House of Hohenzollern, where a number of her children are buried nearby, including her son Prince Ernst Heinrich. Her estate is found in the Central State Archive of Dresden.

<text>The Waccamaw River is a river, approximately 140 miles (225 km) long, in southeastern North Carolina and eastern South Carolina in the United States. It drains an area of approximately 1,110 square miles (2886 km2) in the coastal plain along the eastern border between the two states into the Atlantic Ocean. Along its upper course, it is a slow-moving, blackwater river surrounded by vast wetlands, passable only by shallow-draft watercraft such as canoe. Along its lower course, it is lined by sandy banks and old plantation houses, providing an important navigation channel with a unique geography, flowing roughly parallel to the coast.

== Description ==
The Waccamaw River begins its course at Lake Waccamaw, a Carolina bay in Columbus County, North Carolina. Downstream it forms the county line between Columbus and Brunswick counties, flowing generally southwest and parallel to the coastline; it is separated from the ocean by approximately 15 miles (24 km).

It enters South Carolina and flows southwest across Horry County, past Conway. Near Burgess, it is joined from the northwest by the Great Pee Dee River, which rises in north central North Carolina. It continues southwest, separated from the ocean by only five miles (8 km) in a long tidal estuary. The long narrow point of land along the ocean formed by the lower river is called Waccamaw Neck. At Georgetown it receives the Black River (South Carolina) from the north, then turns sharply to the southeast and enters the ocean at Winyah Bay, approximately five miles (8 km) north along the coast from the mouth of the Santee River.

Navigable as far as Conway, the lower river has been an important commercial route for European settlers in the region since the 18th century. Before that, it was equally important for various Native American cultures.

In the 19th century, planters developed extensive rice cultivation on lands of the lower Waccamaw River. They depended on the labor of thousands of enslaved Africans and their descendants to cultivate and process this labor-intensive crop. After the American Civil War, some of the large plantations were confiscated by the federal government. In addition, the emancipation of enslaved persons and new laws established a &quot;free labor&quot; market. Some planters established sharecropping or tenant farmers to gain workers, but as freedmen wanted to control some of their work. The rice industry declined under these conditions.

Since the early 20th century, the Waccamaw&#x27;s lower course in South Carolina forms part of what is now known as the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It joins the river from the northeast at Bucksport, South Carolina. Long important to trade and transportation, the waterway also began to be recognized for its recreational uses.

In addition, the river&#x27;s extensive wetlands provide habitat for diverse species, including the Carolina pygmy sunfish and the American black bear. 
&quot;Extensive forest communities cover the Waccamaw floodplain, including cypress-gum swamp and bottomland hardwood forests. The bottomland hardwood forests of the Waccamaw are unique in the Carolinas in containing abundant Atlantic white cedar and live oaks, along with the more typical laurel and overcup oak and loblolly pine.&quot;
The Nature Conservancy has acquired a portion of the habitat for conservation and preservation. They control land along the Waccamaw, the lower Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers for habitat preservation.

A much larger area was acquired by the federal government for the Waccamaw National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1997 near the confluence of these three rivers. Originally consisting of , it is planned to have a total of .

<doc id="696923" wikidata="Q579176" url="?curid=696923" title="International Standard Atmosphere">
<text>The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a static atmospheric model of how the pressure, temperature, density, and viscosity of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere change over a wide range of altitudes or elevations. It has been established to provide a common reference for temperature and pressure and consists of tables of values at various altitudes, plus some formulas by which those values were derived. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) publishes the ISA as an international standard, ISO 2533:1975. Other standards organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United States Government, publish extensions or subsets of the same atmospheric model under their own standards-making authority.

==Description==
The ISA mathematical model divides the atmosphere into layers with an assumed linear distribution of absolute temperature &quot;T&quot; against geopotential altitude &quot;h&quot;. The other two values (pressure &quot;P&quot; and density &quot;ρ&quot;) are computed by simultaneously solving the equations resulting from:
* the vertical pressure gradient resulting from hydrostatic balance, which relates the rate of change of pressure with geopotential altitude:
:: formula_1, and
* the ideal gas law in molar form, which relates pressure, density, and temperature:
:: formula_2
at each geopotential altitude, where &quot;g&quot; is the standard acceleration of gravity, and &quot;R&quot;specific is the specific gas constant for dry air (287.0528J⋅kg−1⋅K−1). The solution is given by the barometric formula.

Air density must be calculated in order to solve for the pressure, and is used in calculating dynamic pressure for moving vehicles. Dynamic viscosity is an empirical function of temperature, and kinematic viscosity is calculated by dividing dynamic viscosity by the density.

Thus the standard consists of a tabulation of values at various altitudes, plus some formulas by which those values were derived. To accommodate the lowest points on Earth, the model starts at a base geopotential altitude of &quot;below sea level&quot;, with standard temperature set at 19 °C. With a temperature lapse rate of −6.5 °C (-11.7 °F) per km (roughly −2 °C (-3.6 °F) per 1,000 ft), the table interpolates to the standard mean sea level values of temperature, (1 atm) pressure, and a density of . The tropospheric tabulation continues to , where the temperature has fallen to , the pressure to , and the density to . Between 11 km and 20 km, the temperature remains constant.
:lapse rate given per kilometer of &quot;geopotential altitude (A positive lapse rate (λ &gt; 0) means temperature decreases with height)&quot;

In the above table, &quot;geopotential altitude&quot; is calculated from a mathematical model that adjusts the altitude to include the variation of gravity with height, while &quot;geometric altitude&quot; is the standard direct vertical distance above mean sea level (MSL).
* The equation that relates the two altitudes are (where z is the &quot;geometric altitude&quot;, h is the &quot;geopotential altitude&quot;, and r0 = 6,356,766 m in this model):
:: formula_3
Note that the Lapse Rates cited in the table are given as °C per kilometer of geopotential altitude, not geometric altitude.

The ISA model is based on average conditions at mid latitudes, as determined by the ISO&#x27;s TC 20/SC 6 technical committee. It has been revised from time to time since the middle of the 20th century.

===Use at non-standard day conditions===
The ISA models a hypothetical standard day to allow a reproducible engineering reference for calculation and testing of engine and vehicle performance at various altitudes. It &quot;does not&quot; provide a rigorous meteorological model of actual atmospheric conditions (for example, changes in barometric pressure due to wind conditions). Neither does it account for humidity effects; air is assumed to be dry and clean and of constant composition. Humidity effects are accounted for in vehicle or engine analysis by adding water vapor to the thermodynamic state of the air after obtaining the pressure and density from the standard atmosphere model.

Non-standard (hot or cold) days are modeled by adding a specified temperature delta to the standard temperature at altitude, but pressure is taken as the standard day value. Density and viscosity are recalculated at the resultant temperature and pressure using the ideal gas equation of state. Hot day, Cold day, Tropical, and Polar temperature profiles with altitude have been defined for use as performance references, such as United States Department of Defense MIL-STD-210C, and its successor MIL-HDBK-310.

==ICAO Standard Atmosphere==
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) published their &quot;ICAO Standard Atmosphere&quot; as Doc 7488-CD in 1993. It has the same model as the ISA, but extends the altitude coverage to 80 kilometers (262,500 feet).

The ICAO Standard Atmosphere, like the ISA, does not contain water vapor.

Some of the values defined by ICAO are:
Aviation standards and flying rules are based on the International Standard Atmosphere. Airspeed indicators are calibrated on the assumption that they are operating at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere where the air density is 1.225 kg/m3.

Physical properties of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere are:
==Other standard atmospheres==
The U.S. Standard Atmosphere is a set of models that define values for atmospheric temperature, density, pressure and other properties over a wide range of altitudes. The first model, based on an existing international standard, was published in 1958 by the U.S. Committee on Extension to the Standard Atmosphere, and was updated in 1962, 1966, and 1976. The U.S. Standard Atmosphere, International Standard Atmosphere and WMO (World Meteorological Organization) standard atmospheres are the same as the ISO International Standard Atmosphere for altitudes up to 32 km.

NRLMSISE-00 is a newer model of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from ground to space, developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory taking actual satellite drag data into account. A primary use of this model is to aid predictions of satellite orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. The COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (CIRA) 2012 and the ISO 14222 Earth Atmosphere Density standard both recommend NRLMSISE-00 for composition uses.

JB2008 is a newer model of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from 120 km to 2000 km, developed by the US Air Force Space Command and Space Environment Technologies taking into account realistic solar irradiances and time evolution of geomagnetic storms. It is most useful for calculating satellite orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. Both CIRA 2012 and ISO 14222 recommend JB2008 for mass density in drag uses.

<text>The Trip is a 1967 American psychedelic film released by American International Pictures, directed by Roger Corman and written by Jack Nicholson. It was shot on location in and around Los Angeles, including on top of Kirkwood in Laurel Canyon, the Hollywood Hills, and near Big Sur, California, over three weeks in March and April 1967. Peter Fonda stars as a young man who experiences his first LSD trip.

Released during the Summer of Love, &quot;The Trip&quot; was very popular, particularly with members of the era’s counterculture. It became one of AIP’s most successful releases and was important in the later development of an even larger cultural touchstone in &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, which involved many of the same personnel and appealed to the same young demographic.

==Plot==
Paul Groves, a television commercial director, takes his first dose of LSD while experiencing the heartbreak and ambivalence of divorce from his beautiful but adulterous wife. He starts his trip with a &quot;guide&quot;, John, but runs away and abandons him out of fear.

Experiencing repetitive visions of pursuit by dark hooded figures mounted on black horses, Paul sees himself running across a beach.

As Paul experiences his trip, he wanders around the Sunset Strip, into nightclubs, and into the homes of strangers and acquaintances. Paul considers the roles played by commercialism, sex, and women in his life. He meets a young woman, Glenn, who is interested in people who take LSD. Having learned from Paul recently that he would be taking LSD, she has been looking out for him. Max is another friendly guide to his trip.

Glenn drives Paul to her Malibu beach house, where they make love, interspersed in his mind with a kaleidoscopic riot of abstract images intercut with visions of pursuit on a beach. Driven into the surf by his pursuers, Paul turns and faces them, and they reveal themselves to be his wife and Glenn.

As the sun rises, Paul returns to his normal state of consciousness, now transformed by the trip, and steps out to the balcony to get some fresh air. Glenn asks him whether his first LSD experience was constructive. Paul defers his answer to &quot;tomorrow.&quot;

==Production==


The film was first announced as early as July 12, 1966 in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; with Daniel Haller considered to direct, although Corman soon took over the project. Peter Fonda&#x27;s agents had warned him against taking the lead role, as he already had a bad public reputation with drugs including a recent arrest for marijuana; Fonda was adamant, however, and even performed for a reduced salary. Nancy Sinatra, who had starred with Fonda in &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;, was also briefly considered for a role.

Corman did research by taking LSD himself while scouting locations at Big Sur, noting it was under &quot;strict medical supervision&quot; with a stenographer to record what happened, and stated that the film would not be unsympathetic to the drug. Charles B. Griffith wrote the first two drafts of the script; the first one was about the social issues of the sixties; the second one was an opera. Corman then hired Jack Nicholson to write the eventual screenplay. Corman encouraged Nicholson&#x27;s experimental writing style and gives between 80 and 90% credit to Nicholson for the shooting script in the director&#x27;s commentary. Corman slightly modified the story to stay within budget.

On using Nicholson as a screenwriter Corman said, &quot;I hired him because I knew he was a very good writer. He had written several scripts before. His career wasn’t really doing that much at that time. I knew he had experience with LSD, so I hired him as a writer. I was thinking of possibly using Jack for the role that Bruce Dern played. But I wanted to repeat some of the casting, particularly Peter Fonda and Bruce Dern from &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;, so I went with Bruce for that reason.&quot; AIP executive Samuel Z. Arkoff recalled &quot;The first draft of Jack&#x27;s script turned out to be immense--about three inches thick. He had crammed nearly every social and political concern of the sixties into it. He also had included so many special effects that it would have challenged the creative talents and the budgets of George Lucas. According to Fonda biographer Peter Collier, upon reading this initial draft, the actor allegedly cried and proclaimed it would be the greatest American film ever made.

Filming began on March 29, 1967 and lasted approximately three weeks. The interior of the house with the indoor/outdoor pool where Fonda takes his LSD trip was located on Blue Heights Drive near Laurel Canyon and occupied at the time by Arthur Lee of the band Love. According to Corman, most of the intensely psychedelic decor seen in the house had already been set up by Lee with little additional decoration needed. The house can also be seen in the promotional film for Love&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;Your Mind and We Belong Together&quot;. The large circular main room of the house seen at the beginning with Dennis Hopper was shot at the San Souci Culture Temple on Ardmore Ave., which had been renamed &quot;The Psychedelic Temple&quot;; it would also be used as the gallery in &quot;Psych-Out&quot;. Corman also had Hopper film Fonda wandering across desert dunes in Yuma, Arizona and Big Dune, Nevada for some of the vision sequences of the trip. For the topless sequence at the Bead Game club, shot at an actual L.A. establishment, assistant director Paul Rapp admitted passing around hundreds of amyl nitrate poppers to the dancing extras to &quot;get their energy up a pitch&quot;.

Roger Corman wildly edited some scenes for &quot;The Trip&quot;, particularly the exterior night scenes on the Sunset Strip, to simulate the LSD user&#x27;s racing mind. &quot;The Trip&quot; also features photographic effects, body paint on seminude actresses to lend atmosphere, and colorful patterned lighting, both during sex scenes and in a club, which imitates LSD-induced hallucinations. Assistant cameraman Allen Daviau recalled that &quot;Bob used liquid light projectors. He used strobe lights. He used all kinds of devices for changing color gels in the middle of a shot&quot;. Many of the special effects in the film were developed by Peter Gardiner, who had caught the attention of Fonda just days before filming began. Finally, Corman included inscrutable fantasy sequences including one where Fonda is faced with revolving pictures of Che Guevara, Sophia Loren and Khalil Gibran in a wildly lit room. For no apparent reason, a little person riding a merry-go-round in the background blurts &quot;Bay of Pigs!!&quot;

The story plays over a backdrop of improvisational jazz, blues rock, and electronic music by Mike Bloomfield&#x27;s new band The Electric Flag, including an exotic organ and horn-drenched theme. Gram Parsons and the International Submarine Band, seen as the band rehearsing in a club at the start of the film, are one of the earliest country-rock acts. It had been Fonda&#x27;s original intention to use ISB music in the soundtrack, which resulted in the group recording the song &quot;Lazy Days&quot; to be used in the film. However, the song wasn&#x27;t considered psychedelic enough to be used for the scene the band appeared in, and music by The Electric Flag (aka &quot;An American Music Band&quot;) is what is actually heard in the film. The Electric Flag&#x27;s soundtrack to &quot;The Trip&quot; features some of the earliest use of the Moog synthesizer on a pop/rock record. Peter Fonda claimed to &quot;Esquire&quot; that Corman abandoned the film before scoring was completed, leading Fonda to spend an additional $7,500 of his own money on the music; this claim was disputed by Corman.

Salli Sachse, who played Glenn, recalled working on the film:
Roger was a very linear director–everything went from A to B to C. He was very serious. You didn&#x27;t goof off or kick back while working with him. You had to be very on-task. It was a stricter atmosphere than I was used to. Roger felt that there had to be a distinction between Susan Strasberg&#x27;s character and mine, so he wanted me to appear as a blonde... &quot;The Trip&quot; didn&#x27;t deserve all the bad press it received. There was no drug use going on during filming–it was strictly professional. Maybe after hours, but I couldn&#x27;t talk for anybody else.&lt;br&gt;

AIP insisted on making two modifications to the final cut of the film: an opening pre-credit monologue warning of the dangers of LSD, and an effect of &quot;shattered glass&quot; over Fonda&#x27;s face in the final shot to imply that taking the drug had left him shattered and confused. When Corman heard about these modifications he was upset, feeling that the ending of the film should be left ambiguous. AIP also obscured the images on the television screen in the scene where Fonda wanders into a middle-class suburban home, because it contained grisly news footage of the Vietnam War.

==Release==

Released on 23 August 1967 during the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;, the film had a huge cultural impact and grossed $6 million against a budget of $300,000. Corman commented on the popularity of the film, &quot;I think that one of the reasons that the audience came in such large numbers was out of curiosity. They didn’t really want to take LSD, but the reviews and comments said this came somewhat close to an LSD experience, so they could take it without taking it&quot;.

The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) put out an advisory to TV stations against running ads for the film, due to certain ads featuring Fonda&#x27;s nude backside and language describing the hallucinatory effects of LSD. The film itself encountered censorship problems in the UK and was refused a certificate four times by the BBFC. A cinema classification was rejected in 1967, 1971 and 1980 and again for video in 1988. It was released on DVD fully uncut in 2004.

==Reception==
Upon release, initial reviews were highly polarized. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; enthusiastically called it &quot;the most unabashed art film ever to come out of Hollywood...Ingmar Bergman for the teenyboppers, Dali for the drive-ins&quot;. Conversely, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Is this a psychedelic experience? Is this what it&#x27;s like to take a trip? If it is, then it&#x27;s all a big put-on. Or is this simply making a show with adroitly staged fantasy episodes and good color photography effects? In my estimation, it is the latter. And I would warn you that all you are likely to take away from the &quot;Rivoli&quot; or the &quot;72d Street Playhouse&quot;, where the picture opened yesterday, is a painful case of eye-strain and perhaps a detached retina.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;&quot;The Trip&quot; is a psychedelic tour through the bent mind of Peter Fonda, which is evidently full of old movies. In a flurry of flesh, mattresses, flashing lights and kaleidoscopic patterns, an alert viewer will spot some fancy business from such classics as &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, even &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;... The photographer&#x27;s camera work is bright enough, and full of tricks, without beginning to suggest the heightened inner awareness so frequently claimed by those who use the drug.&quot; Meanwhile, Judith Christ of &quot;The Today Show&quot; savaged the film as &quot;little more than an hour-and-a-half commercial for LSD...The subject matter enables the director to make a totally incoherent movie with erratic, repetitious and fake-arty effects that simply nauseate, both intellectually and physically&quot;.

Gene Youngblood of &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; wrote, &quot;Corman’s film is not fine art; more precisely, it’s not refined art. But it is possibly the purest cinematic exercise ever to come out of Hollywood. Here, for the first time to my knowledge, Hollywood gives us a truly cinematic experience: a visual film, structured literally of pictures that move; a montage that is brisk and relatively arbitrary; a storyline that is appreciably abstract, and, most important, a film that pays tribute to the power of the image over the word — this from an industry in which most movies are merely photographed radio scripts.&quot; Another positive review came from &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, who concluded &quot;&quot;The Trip&quot; is technically and visually one of the most spectacular pictures ever made.

The movie holds a 39% &quot;Rotten&quot; score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 critics with the consensus: &quot;&quot;The Trip&quot;″s groovy effects and compelling message can&#x27;t overcome the rough acting, long meandering stretches, and pedestrian plot.&quot; Nonetheless, the film retains a strong cult following, particularly in Europe where it is hailed for its application of various New Wave cinema techniques within the Hollywood system.

===Box office===
The movie was very popular: Corman says it took $6 million in rentals during its initial release. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, $5.1 million was in North America, and total revenue is estimated at around $10 million.

Writing for &quot;FilmInk&quot;, Stephen Vagg argued the film &quot;proved to Corman that you could make personal movies as long as they had authenticity and naked women.&quot;

Despite being one of American International Pictures (AIP) most profitable films, Samuel Z. Arkoff said they stopped making &quot;dope pictures&quot; soon after &quot;The Trip&quot; because he sensed the cycle would exhaust itself quickly. In 1974 he said &quot;everybody else picked it up; and as late as last year they were still coming out with dope pictures. And there isn&#x27;t one single company that made a buck on dope pictures. The young people had turned off.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Trip&quot; was released in a Region 1 DVD by MGM on April 15, 2003 as part of their &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; series doubled with a similar film, &quot;Psych-Out&quot;, on a double-sided disc.

In 2015, the MGM HD channel broadcast a newly-constructed &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; of the film, which removed the opening disclaimer and the &quot;shattered glass&quot; ending imposed by AIP, as well as restoring additional footage to the Bead Game club party scene and exit music previously clipped on home video releases. This alternate version was later released on Blu-ray in Region B by Signal One films that year, and on Region A Blu-ray by Olive Films in 2016. The Signal One Blu-ray retained special features created for the previous MGM DVD, including a Roger Corman commentary track, and offered the AIP-mandated scenes (with Corman commentary) as bonus material. The Olive Blu-ray did not port any of the special features, but did include the original trailer.

==In other media==
In 2004, film historian Tim Lucas and his friend Charlie Largent&#x27;s screenplay &quot;The Man with Kaleidoscope Eyes&quot;, which serves as a fictionalized account on the making of &quot;The Trip&quot;, was optioned by Corman&#x27;s frequent collaborator Joe Dante. After years of development on the script, which included rewrites by Michael Almereyda and James Robison, as well as Elijah Wood joining development as a co-producer through his company SpectreVision, a live table read of the script was hosted at the Vista Theater in Los Angeles on October 12, 2016. Moderated by Dante, the cast included Bill Hader as Corman, Jason Ritter as Fonda, Ethan Embry as Nicholson, Claudia O’Doherty as Corman&#x27;s assistant Frances Doel and Pat Healy as screenwriter Charles B. Griffith, with James Adomian and Sarah Burns portraying other characters and Corman playing an older version of himself. Writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, Steve Greene praised the presentation of the reading and the &quot;element of playful investigation&quot; in Hader&#x27;s portrayal of Corman; in an interview about the project, Lucas described Hader&#x27;s performance as &quot;remarkable and funny&quot;.

Lucas later adapted the script of &quot;The Man with Kaleidoscope Eyes&quot; into a novel, which was published by PS Publishing through their Electric Dreamhouse imprint in April 2022 in a signed hardback edition limited to 100 copies, a retail hardback edition and an eBook. The author revealed that details about Corman and the setting within the novel were expanded upon compared to the screenplay, drawing on correspondence with Doel and Julie Corman.

<text>The Minquiers and Ecréhous are two groups of islands and rocks forming part of the Bailiwick of Jersey, Channel Islands. They are respectively the most southerly and northerly land territories of the Bailiwick. The islands have no permanent inhabitants.

*The [[Minquiers]] (&quot;Les Minquiers&quot;) are situated 9 miles south of Jersey, and are administratively part of the Parish of Grouville and the Vingtaine de la Rocque.
*The [[Écréhous]] (&quot;Les Écréhous&quot;) are situated 6 miles north-east of Jersey (8 miles from France), and are administratively part of the Parish of St. Martin and the Vingtaine de Rozel.

==History==

In 1950, Britain and France went to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for friendly discussions to decide to which country the Minquiers and Ecréhous belonged. 
The French fished in the waters, but Jersey exercised various administrative rights. Certain maps showed the Ecréhous islands as not being part of Jersey.
The ICJ considered the historical evidence, and in its Judgment of 17 November 1953 awarded the islands to Jersey.

==References==
*Files on the ICJ case can be found in the National Archives, mostly in the FO 371 sequence.

<text>Gex (; ; ) is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France and a subprefecture of the department.

It lies from the Swiss border and from Geneva. It is a subprefecture of Ain.

==History==
The town gave its name to the &quot;Pays de Gex&quot;, at various times under the jurisdiction of France, Switzerland and the Duchy of Savoy.

The future site of Gex was inhabited around 1800 BC. Around 220 BC, a group of Gallic warriors known as the Gaesatae resided in the area around Gex. Afterwards, the town was part of Roman Gaul.

In 1252, Léonette of Geneva, Lady of Gex, descendant of the count of Geneva, Amadeus I, married Simon of Joinville, son of Simon of Joinville and Beatrix of Auxonne, Lady of Marnay. The city of Gex was included in her dowry. Later that century, the Joinvilles set up a castellan and a judge in the town.

On November 13, 1353, the town of Gex as well as its castle were captured by Savoy, and the &quot;pays de Gex&quot; was incorporated into the Savoyard state for nearly two centuries. The &quot;pays de Gex&quot; was invaded in 1536 by the Canton of Bern. The Bernese established a bailiwick at Gex, managed by a bailiff. Walls were built in 1550.

The &quot;pays de Gex&quot; was returned to the Duchy of Savoy by the treaties of Nyon in 1563 and Lausanne in 1564. The Genevans seized it in 1589. Savoy, with the assistance of Spain, tried several times to take back the &quot;pays de Gex&quot;, but they were unsuccessful. During these attacks, the town of Gex was burned in 1590 on July 23 and again on July 30; few of the houses withstood the fires.

In 1601, during the reign of Henry IV, control of the &quot;pays de Gex&quot; passed to France as part of the Treaty of Lyon.

With the 1815 , (signed on 20 November) and the Treaty of Paris of the same date, Gex was placed in the Customs region of Switzerland and neutralised. The resolutions regarding the Pays de Gex were annulled by Art 435 of the Treaty of Versailles. In November 1923 France moved its customs office to Gex, and the matter was brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice (predecessor of the International Court of Justice), which decided in favour of Switzerland; this case is also notable for being an early example of the doctrine of fundamentally changed circumstances being invoked before an international court. A compromise was reached in 1932.

Historically, citizens spoke a dialect of the Franco-Provençal language but this dialect is not in use anymore. In 1910 the commune of Mijoux was created from part of the commune of Gex.

==Population==

Population data for 1906 and earlier include the commune of Mijoux.
==Economy==
Its principal market for exports is Geneva. A weekly market takes place in the town on Saturdays.

<text>Bouncy techno is a hardcore dance music rave style that developed in the early 1990s from Scotland and Northern England. Described as an accessible gabber-like form, it was popularised by Scottish DJ and music producer Scott Brown under numerous aliases and Ultra-Sonic who were formed in Ayrshire. 

The sound became prominent in the northern United Kingdom rave scene before it broke into the hardcore homeland of the Netherlands through Dutch DJ and music producer Paul Elstak, where it became known &quot;there&quot; as happy hardcore or happy gabber and funcore. 
A subsequent mainstream-aimed Eurodance tangent appeared in Germany and itself back into the Netherlands. Scott Brown&#x27;s music also changed the Southern England happy breakbeat style away from its breakbeat foundation and into a bouncy derivative. These different country entrails created a single pan European hardcore briefly in the mid-1990s. Bouncy techno rapidly declined from this point for a variety of reasons.

==History==

===Antecedents: early 1990s===
The breakbeat hardcore style that dominated raves across England was generally not popular in Scotland. This is attributed to regional music, cultural and racial differences across the UK; with breakbeat regarded in Scotland as a &quot;black English thing&quot; and an &quot;alien musical culture&quot;.

The few Scottish-based DJs who supported this music found it difficult to be booked locally. DJ Kid told the crowd to &quot;fuck off&quot; on the mic before he stormed off stage when ravers turned hostile towards him playing such a set. A divide in the United Kingdom rave scene occurred as a result with separate musical paths of development.

Scotland instead favoured techno and vocal/piano music at raves. The Time Frequency (TTF) led the charge of local bands. After three chart hit records in the UK Singles Chart Top 40 across 1993, which peaked with &quot;Real Love&quot; at number eight, their commercial success in part resulted in a backlash against the band. With the vocal/piano approach now tainted, ravers turned their attention to an alternative form of underground music that had since materialised.

===Origins: early to mid 1990s===

====Scotland and Northern England====
Bass Generator introduced the gabber style to northern ravers. These sets would prove popular and earned him Best Rave DJ and Best UK DJ by Clubscene readers for 1993. To keep crowds receptive, the slower and softer vocal/piano anthems would also be played but unorthodoxly mixed at greatly increased speeds to match them to the much faster and aggressive gabber. This created a peculiar clash of styles; an early template of what would become bouncy techno (this concoction was something he would eventually release as &quot;The Event&quot; (1993)).

With a potential new avenue, Scott Brown reinterpreted the gabber sound into a more accessible interpretation for local audiences. His Bass X &quot;Hardcore Disco&quot; track in 1993 was the first hardcore release in Scotland (and the UK). The runner-up Best Scottish Dance Record for 1993 set the trend in Scotland; followed-up by his Dance Overdose remix in a similar fashion. Other local acts replicated this popular winning formula. Even The Time Frequency also got in on the act and anonymously released &quot;The Bounce&quot; (1993) to fool their critics.

Brown and his sound was propelled to the forefront of the hardcore scene in Scotland and abroad. In the year of 1994, Brown released 27 x 12&quot; vinyl records under assorted aliases across 10 labels, 2 x compilation LPs, 22 x remix credits and launched five record labels under his Evolution Records stable; the majority of this music in his bouncy techno style.

Local artists and DJs soon appeared in Western Europe, Australia and Japan; Q-Tex (Brown) and Ultra-Sonic played at the Mayday music festivals in Germany of 1994. Other factors in the style&#x27;s exposure included DJ Carl Cox who played the founding Shoop! Records releases at raves; and DJ Tom Wilson&#x27;s award-winning Steppin&#x27; Out dance music radio show that captured 82% of the available listening audience during Saturday evenings on Forth FM.

====Netherlands and Germany====

In the Netherlands, Paul Elstak felt that their own gabber was caught in a race to be the hardest at the expense of quality. He found a new direction with Bass Reaction &quot;Technophobia&quot; (1993); another production from Brown. It brought an unexpected cheerful melody to the heavy undercurrent. The track was re-released for the Dutch market in 1994, where its success inspired Elstak and others to produce the same less frenetic sound, which became known &quot;there&quot; as happy hardcore (i.e.: happy gabber).

Dutch labels dedicated to the &quot;new rage&quot; appeared such as Babyboom, Pengo, Waxweazle and Elstak&#x27;s own Forze Records. Ironically, Brown&#x27;s initial attempts to front Combined Forces new label venture was considered too hard in the Dutch landscape that he had changed. They expected music in Brown&#x27;s own style and not that of gabber.

Concurrently, the Scottish duo Ultra-Sonic unconventionally combined the slower piano approach with the faster Brown-type beat; &quot;Annihilating Rhythm&quot; won Best Scottish Dance Record for 1993. The act claimed it &quot;changed the face of dance music&quot;. The track became the inspiration for Scooter &quot;Hyper Hyper&quot; (1994) and Charly Lownoise and Mental Theo &quot;Live at London&quot; (1994). Both were the first such musical chart entries in Germany and the Netherlands respectively.

These successes created a path for further mainstream music to be exploited. Scooter achieved much commercial chart success around western Europe; Ultra-Sonic claimed that Scooter were &quot;ripping us off&quot;. Elstak meanwhile enlisted people in the eurodance field to produce a chart hit for him. Importantly, this particular music was not happy hardcore itself but alternative eurodance versions created for radio airplay in the style of Culture Beat.

====Southern England====
Bouncy techno had already been supported in small numbers at raves in England by the like of DJs Brisk, Chris C and Ramos.

Happy breakbeat DJs such as Dougal and Vibes initially introduced bouncy techno tracks to their breakbeat mix sets; Scott Brown Versus DJ Rab S &quot;Now is the Time&quot; (1995) release being a catalyst. Artists in this field started to add bouncy techno characteristics to their compositions, which created a new type of happy breakbeat music.

Several happy breakbeat labels created offshoots dedicated to bouncy techno, such as Bounce! Records from Happy Vibes Recordings in late 1995. These labels would quickly become redundant as happy breakbeat itself developed in a similar light.

===Decline: mid 1990s===
With the influence now found across several different markets, a single pan European hardcore was formed. This was however short lived. Due to several drug related deaths at Hanger 13 that attracted national press and parliamentary debate, local authorities in Scotland clamped down on raves and clubs switched to house music.

The Metropolis, one of the leading venues for bouncy techno, dropped the music in 1996 due to its clown-suited PA scene and regarded it as &quot;timewarp techno&quot; (a word play of tartan techno). Ultra-Sonic similarly stated that &quot;someone [Brown] came up with a style of music&quot; that everyone copied and &quot;nothing new was evolving&quot; as a result.

The new bouncy techno influenced happy breakbeat from Southern England was heavily pushed in Scotland as the next big thing but with little success. Bass Generator singled it out as having &quot;killed the music scene up north&quot; as it was an advanced form of breakbeat so was never going to work.

Rezerection closed its doors in 1997 as interest dwindled. Synonymous with the rave scene and hardcore music; the two were inseparable. Brown said of the promotion&#x27;s demise that &quot;Scottish &#x27;bouncy&#x27; hardcore is almost a thing of the past&quot; and looked to expand his horizons to other music. Bass Generator&#x27;s own Judgement Day looked to fill their void with a traditional Hogmanay rave to specifically kick-start a bouncy techno revival for 1998.

In Netherlands, hardcore fans became tired of funcore and felt betrayed by Elstak&#x27;s subsequent chart forays. Dutch producers reverted to gabber after a final few parting shots with releases like Chico Chipolata &quot;No More Happy Hardcore&quot; (1996), Buzz Fuzz &quot;Fuck Happy&quot; (1997); whilst Bodylotion &quot;Happy Is Voor Hobos&quot; (1996) alternated between droll bouncy and no-nonsense gabber parts to get their message across.

===Relaunch: late 1990s===

As an alternative to the now formulaic music from Southern England, Brown launched the Bouncy Techno label in 1998. Plagued by distribution problems, the imprint revealed a new uplifting trance approach to his work. Brown&#x27;s &quot;Elysium&quot; (1999) helped revitalise the domestic rave scene to much success.

Producers picked up on Brown&#x27;s lead, as others had done in the past. In the early 2000s, labels that included Quosh Records and Higher Order Recordings would release music with a bouncy techno influence. These would be subsumed into what became generically known as UK hardcore.

Throwback events had also appeared in the 2000s such as Back to the Future and Fantazia in Scotland, and Happy Hardcore in Netherlands. Kutski dedicated several sets to bouncy techno on his BBC Radio 1 show, like the Rezerection Free Range Mix in 2011.

==Characteristics==
Typical compositions have a tempo of 160 to 180 BPM, and use a 4/4 signature. Tracks can be instrumental, or use a short repeated sample at certain points. Singing is uncommon. Brown uses a regimented structure with components occurring for a fixed length. e.g.: beat solo, bouncy with beat, hi-hat added, riff solo, riff with beat, hi-hat added, etc. each lasting 8-bars. These parts would be pieced together with short fills and rolls. Drum kicks are slightly distorted, like gabber. Breakbeat patterns may also occur briefly in the background at certain points.

Whilst breakbeat hardcore itself was not popular in Scotland, its synthesiser sounds were found in bouncy techno&#x27;s range of stab melodies. N-Joi&#x27;s &quot;Live in Manchester&quot; (1992) feast provided further general inspiration. Its hallmark is the single-keyed offbeat note, which relates to its &#x27;bouncy&#x27; designation (this offbeat focus was found in the latter bouncy house namesake). These rhythmic combinations and arrangements were described by Simon Reynolds as being reminiscent of klezmer music, fairground-like melodies and oom-pah offbeat notes.

The N-Joi group provided another important attribute. Unlike other rave music from this period, the Scottish scene was performance driven where bands often headlined raves rather than DJs. Acts were expected to have costumes, dancers and the best stage performance. Dancers were dressed in baggy tracksuit-like attire and had their own form of dance that involves a lot of rapid leg movements. The performances of Ultra-Sonic filtered through to the like Scooter on a wider level.

<text>Enchanted Rock is a pink granite mountain located in the Llano Uplift about north of Fredericksburg, Texas and south of Llano, Texas, United States. Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, which includes Enchanted Rock and surrounding land, spans the border between Gillespie and Llano counties, south of the Llano River. Enchanted Rock covers roughly and rises around above the surrounding terrain to an elevation of above sea level. It is the largest pink granite monadnock in the United States. Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, a part of the Texas state park system, includes . In 1936, the area was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. In 1971, Enchanted Rock was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

Enchanted Rock was rated in 2017 as the best campsite in Texas in a 50-state survey. The State Natural Area had 307,686 visitors in 2022.

==Geology==

The prominent granite dome is visible for many miles in the surrounding basin of the Llano Uplift. The weathered dome, standing above the surrounding plain, is known to geologists as a monadnock. The rock is actually only the visible above-ground portion of a segmented ridge, the surface expression of a large igneous batholith, called the Town Mountain Granite, of middle Precambrian () material that intruded into earlier metamorphic schist, called the Packsaddle Schist. The intrusive granite of the rock mass, or pluton, was exposed by extensive erosion of the surrounding sedimentary rock, primarily the Cretaceous Edwards limestone that is exposed a few miles to the south.

==Enchanted Rock State Natural Area and Conservation==
Park activities include hiking, picknicking, rock climbing, primitive backpacking, camping, and caving. The Summit Trail is the most popular hiking path.

Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) partners with Friends of Enchanted Rock, a volunteer-based nonprofit organization that works for the improvement and preservation of Enchanted Rock State Natural Area. Scheduled Summit Trail tours are on the third Saturday of the month starting April, May, September, October, November, and December. Private tours are available for groups at other times.

The Granite Gripper is an annual rock climbing competition that acts as a fundraiser for park conservation through the Friends of Enchanted Rock. Emphasis is placed on activity safety and ecological preservation.

Visitors are asked to keep human incursion at a minimum by not disturbing plants, animals, or artifacts. Pets are not allowed on the summit trail.

Federal and state statutes, regulations, and rules governing archeological and historic sites apply. The state Game Warden as a commissioned peace officer is authorized to inspect natural resources and take any necessary action for their preservation.

==Nature==
===Fauna===

Wildlife at Enchanted Rock includes white-tailed deer, ringtail, nine-banded armadillo, rock and fox squirrel, rabbit, and red harvester ants. A wide variety of lizards, including the Texas horned lizard, also make the Enchanted Rock area their home. Vernal pools on the rock contain fragile invertebrate fairy shrimp.

Designated a key bird watching site, bird enthusiasts can observe many species including wild turkey, greater roadrunner, golden-fronted woodpecker, Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub jay, canyon towhee, rufous-crowned sparrow, black-throated sparrow, lesser goldfinch, common poorwill, chuck-will&#x27;s-widow, black-chinned hummingbird, vermilion flycatcher, scissor-tailed flycatcher, Bell&#x27;s vireo, yellow-throated vireo, blue grosbeak, painted bunting, orchard oriole, vesper sparrow, fox sparrow, Harris&#x27;s sparrow, northern cardinal, canyon wren, and lark sparrow.

===Flora===
More than 500 species of plants, from four chief plant communities — open oak woodland, mesquite grassland, floodplain, and granite rock community — inhabit the rock. Specific species include plateau live oak, Texas beargrass, prickly pear cactus, and sideoats grama.

==History==


Archaeological evidence indicates human visitation at the rock going back at least 11,000 years, per the book &quot;The Enchanted Rock&quot; published in 1999 by Ira Kennedy:

These hunter-gatherers had flint-tipped spears, fire, and stories. With these resources, some 12,000 years ago, the first Texans became the wellspring of Plains Indian culture. Based on archaeological evidence, human habitation at Enchanted Rock can be traced back at least 10,000 years. Paleo-Indian projectile points or arrowheads, 11–12,000 years old, have been found in the area upstream and downstream from the rock. The oldest authenticated projectile point found within the present-day park is a Plainview point, dating back 10,000 years.

The rock has been the subject of numerous geological surveys and paintings.
===Vandalism===
In 2016, two citizens of San Marcos, Texas were arrested for vandalizing the &quot;... south face of the summit at Enchanted Rock State Park&quot;. The summit was vandalized with graffiti again in 2018 but no arrests have been made in that case. Such vandalism is a state felony in Texas, carrying &quot;a penalty of up to two years in state jail and a $10,000 fine if convicted&quot;.

===Expansion===
In August 2024 TPWD approved the purchase of 630 acres adjacent to Enchanted Rock, which expanded the size of the park by almost 40%. In January of 2025, an additional 3,073 acres of adjacent land was purchased, almost tripling the park&#x27;s size.

The funds for these purchases came from the $1 billion Centennial Parks Conservation Fund, which was created in 2023 during the 88th Texas Legislature with the passage of S.J.R. 84.

==Legends==
Folklore of local Tonkawa, Apache and Comanche tribes ascribe magical and spiritual powers to the rock (hence the name Enchanted Rock). The Tonkawa, who inhabited the area in the 16th century, believed that ghost fires flickered at the top of the dome. In particular, they heard unexplained creaking and groaning, which geologists attribute to night-time contraction of the rock after being heated by the sun during the day. The first European to visit the area was probably Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1536. To elude Anglo settlers in the area, the natives would hide on the top two tiers of the rock, where they could not be seen from the ground below. The name &quot;Enchanted Rock&quot; derives from Spanish and Anglo-Texan interpretations of such legends and related folklore; the name &quot;Crying Rock&quot; has also been given to the formation.

A plaque formerly embedded in Enchanted Rock near the top but now displayed in a kiosk below reads:

<doc id="696946" wikidata="Q211198" url="?curid=696946" title="Audience">
<text>An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called &quot;readers&quot;), theatre, music (in which they are called &quot;listeners&quot;), video games (in which they are called &quot;players&quot;), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art. Some events invite overt audience participation and others allow only modest clapping and criticism and reception.

Media audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. The biggest art form is the mass media. Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations.

In the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, &quot;Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don&#x27;t give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will.&quot; Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, &quot;The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be — what application, what device, what time, what place.&quot;

==Types==
===Particular (real)===
In rhetoric, some audiences depend on circumstance and situation and are characterized by the individuals that make up the audience. Sometimes these audiences are subject to persuasion and engage with the ideas of the speaker. Ranging in size and composition, this audience may come together and form a &quot;composite&quot; of multiple groups.

====Immediate====
An immediate audience is a type of audience that is composed of individuals who are face-to-face subjects with a speaker and a speaker&#x27;s rhetorical text or speech. This audience directly listens to, engages with, and consumes the rhetorical text in an unmediated fashion. In measuring immediate audience reception and feedback, (audience measurement), one can depend on personal interviews, applause, and verbal comments made during and after a rhetorical speech.

====Mediated====
In contrast to immediate audiences, mediated audiences are composed of individuals who consume rhetorical texts in a manner that is different from the time or place in which a speaker presents text. Audiences who consume texts or speeches through television, radio and internet are considered mediated audiences because those mediums separate the rhetor and the audience. Such audiences are physically away from the audience and the message is controlled. Understanding the size and composition of mediated audiences can be difficult because mediums such as television, radio, and Internet can displace the audience from the time and circumstance of a rhetorical text or speech. In measuring mediated audience reception and feedback (a practice called audience measurement), one can depend on opinion polls and ratings, as well as comments and forums that may be featured on a website. This applies to many fields such as movies, songs and much more. There are companies that specialize in audience measurement.

===Theoretical (imagined)===
Theoretical audiences are imagined for the purpose of helping a speaker compose, practice, or a critic to understand, a rhetorical text or speech.

====Self (self-deliberation)====
When a rhetor deeply considers, questions, and deliberates over the content of the ideas they are conveying, it can be said that these individuals are addressing the audience of self, or self-deliberating. Scholars Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, in their book &quot;The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation&quot;, argue that the rhetor &quot;is in a better position than anyone else to test the value of his own arguments.&quot; The audience of self, while not serving as the ends to all rhetorical purpose or circumstance, nevertheless acts as a type of audience that not only operates as a function of self-help, but as instrument used to discover the available means of persuasion.

====Universal====
The universal audience is an imagined audience that serves as an ethical and argumentative test for the rhetor. This also requires the speaker to imagine a composite audience that contains individuals from diverse backgrounds and to discern whether or not the content of the rhetorical text or speech would appeal to individuals within that audience. Scholars Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca ascertain that the content addressed to a universal audience &quot;must convince the reader that the reasons adduced are of a compelling character, that they are self-evident, and possess an absolute and timeless validity&quot;. The concept of the universal audience has received criticism for being idealistic because it can be considered as an impediment in achieving persuasive effect with particular audiences. Yet, it still may be useful as an ethical guide for a speaker and a critical tool for a reader or audience.

====Ideal====
An ideal audience is a rhetor&#x27;s imagined, intended audience. In creating a rhetorical text, a rhetor imagines is the target audience, a group of individuals that will be addressed, persuaded, or affected by the speech or rhetorical text. This type of audience is not necessarily imagined as the most receptive audience, but as the future particular audience that the rhetor will engage with. Imagining such an audience allows a rhetor to formulate appeals that will grant success in engaging with the future particular audience. In considering an ideal audience, a rhetor can imagine future conditions of mediation, size, demographics, and shared beliefs among the audience to be persuaded.

====Implied====
An implied audience is an imaginary audience determined by an auditor or reader as the text&#x27;s constructed audience. The implied audience is not the actual audience, but the one that can be inferred by reading or analyzing the text. Communications scholar Edwin Black, in his essay, The Second Persona, presents the theoretical concept of the implied audience using the idea of two personae. The first persona is the implied rhetoric (the idea of the speaker formed by the audience) and the second persona is the implied audience (the idea of the audience formed by and utilized for persuasion in the speech situation). A critic could also determine what the text wants that audience to become or do after the rhetorical situation.

==== On the web ====
Through the Internet, every person is given the opportunity to participate in different ways. The Internet gives people a platform to write and reach the people who are interested in what they are writing about. When writers write online, they are able to form communities with the people they share common interests with. The audiences that people are trying to reach can be general or specific, all depending on what the writer is discussing in their online posts. Audiences have to go and check into what the writers are writing to stay on top of the latest information. Writers have to find their niche and try hard to work their way into an already formed community. The audience the writer is reaching is able to respond to the writers posts and can give feedback. The Internet allows these connections to be formed and fostered. In the &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot; book by Clay Shirky, there are various examples of how audience is not only receiving content but actually creating it. The Internet creates a chance of being part of an audience and a creator at the same time.

==Audience participation==
Audience participation is commonly found in performances which break the fourth wall. Examples include the traditional British pantomimes, stand-up comedy, and creative stage shows such as Blue Man Group.

Audience participation can be uncomfortable for certain people, but is growing and evolving as a new tool of brand activation and brand engagement. In a bid to create and reinforce a special bond between brands and their consumers, companies are increasingly looking towards events that involve active audience participation. Often, organizations provide branded objects to event attendees that will involve the audience in the show as well as act as souvenirs of the event, creating a lasting link with the brand. For example, during Super Bowl XLVIII, the audience was incorporated in the Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show as part of the lighting effects. Pepsi involved the spectators by giving them &quot;video ski hats&quot; that produced visual effects across the crowd.
By appealing more directly to people and emotions, brands can obtain feedback from their consumers. Companies that provide or seek such experiences refer to the term &quot;crowd activation&quot;. For example, Tangible Interaction named one of its branches Crowd Activation and PixMob refers to itself as a crowd activation company on its website.

One of the most well-known examples of popular audience participation accompanies the motion picture and music &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and its earlier stage incarnation &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. The audience participation elements are often seen as the most important part of the picture, to the extent that the audio options on the DVD version include the option.

=== Examples ===
In the audience participation for &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), the audience will make &quot;call backs&quot;, and yell at the screen at certain parts of the movie. Also, a number of props are thrown and used by the audience during certain parts of the film.

&quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980) has become a staple of late-night cinema, even slowly morphing into an audience-participation show in its regular screenings at the Valhalla Cinema, in Melbourne, Australia. John Landis acknowledged the support of the cinema and the fans by a phone call he made to the cinema at the 10th-anniversary screening, and later invited regular attendees to make cameo appearances in &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998). The fans act as the members of the crowd during the performance of &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot;.

In British pantomime performances, the audience is a crucial aspect of the show and is expected to perform certain tasks such as:
* Interacting with an &quot;audience friend&quot;, a character often designed to be comedic and sympathetic, such as Buttons from &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Typical interactions include call and response (e.g. Buttons: &quot;Hiya gang!&quot; Audience: &quot;Hiya Buttons!&quot;)
* Back and forth arguments, usually composed of simple, repetitive phrases (e.g. Character: &quot;No there isn&#x27;t!&quot; Audience: &quot;Yes there is!&quot;)
* &quot;Ghost gags&quot;, where the audience yells loudly to inform the character of imminent danger, usually whilst the character is completely unaware.

&quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&quot; divides the audience into groups assigned to call out the concerns of three components of a character&#x27;s psyche.

In &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, a Broadway theatre musical based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s last, unfinished work, the audience must vote for whom they think the murderer is, as well as the real identity of the detective and the couple who end up together.

The 1984 Summer Olympics included card stunts at the Olympic Stadium.

&quot;Tony n&#x27; Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot; engages the entire audience at once, staging a narrative set during a wedding in which the audience performs the role of &quot;guests&quot;.

The British panel game &quot;QI&quot; often allows the audience to try to answer questions. Currently, the audience have won one show, and have come last in another.

Magic shows often rely on some audience participation. Psychological illusionist Derren Brown relies heavily on audience participation in his live shows.

During performances of the &quot;Radetzky March&quot;, it is traditional for the audience to clap along with the beat of the second (louder) repetitions of the chorus. This is particularly notable at the Neujahrskonzert.

Bloggers, YouTubers, and live streamers often allow their viewers moderated or unmoderated comments sections.

Some musical groups often heavily incorporate audience participation into their live shows. The superhero-themed comedy rock band The Aquabats typically do so within their theatrical stage shows through such antics as &quot;pool floatie races&quot;, where members of the band race across the venue on inflatable rafts via crowd surfing, or providing the audience with projectiles (such as plastic balls or beach balls) to throw at costumed &quot;bad guys&quot; who come out on stage. Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a comedy dance-pop duo, write their music solely for audience participation, utilizing call and response style sing-along songs which are usually accompanied by a simple dance move that the band encourage the audience to follow along with.

===Faux participation===
The television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; features a man and his robots held as imprisoned audience members and tortured by being forced to view &quot;bad&quot; movies; to retain their sanity, they talk throughout and heckled each one.

In a similar vein, the online site Television Without Pity has a stable of reviewers and recappers who speak the lingo of audience members rather than of scholars, and who sometimes act as though they, too, are being tortured.

<text>York St John University (originally established as York Diocesan College), often abbreviated to YSJ, is a public university located on a large urban campus in York, England. Established in 1841, it achieved university status in 2006 and in 2015 was given research degree awarding powers for PhD and other doctoral programmes.

It is one of several higher education institutions which have religious foundations and is part of the Cathedrals Group of Universities.

In 2022, there were 8,350 students, reading a wide variety of subjects, across five schools: School of the Arts; School of Education, Language and Psychology; School of Humanities; School of Science, Technology and Health; and York Business School.

==History==
The university descends from two Anglican teacher training colleges, which were founded in York in 1841 (for men) and 1846 (for women). York St John University&#x27;s founding mission was to improve access to education for people from all walks of life. In 1862, the women&#x27;s college relocated to Ripon. Over the next century, the colleges gradually diversified their education programmes. The colleges, St John&#x27;s College (named for John the Evangelist) and Ripon College, merged in 1974 to form the &quot;College of Ripon and York St John&quot;.

In 1990 the combined institution formally became a college of the University of Leeds; this arrangement allowed it to award degrees in the name of the latter, while remaining in practice largely autonomous. Between 1999 and 2001, all activities were transferred to York and the college received the name &quot;York St John College&quot;.

In February 2006, the College was granted the right to award degrees in its own name and the right to call itself a university college. On 10 July 2006 the Privy Council approved a request from the college to become a full-fledged university; the name became &quot;York St John University&quot; on 1 October 2006, and the first Chancellor (installed at a ceremony in York Minster on 7 March 2007) was the Archbishop of York John Sentamu. Archbishop Sentamu retired in 2019 after 12 years as Chancellor. He was succeeded by BBC broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti.

==Campus==
The university has an eleven-acre city centre campus on Lord Mayor&#x27;s Walk, close to York Minster and the city walls.

=== Creative Centre ===
Opened in 2021, the purpose-built Creative Centre spans three floors and provides teaching space for music, theatre, drama, creative writing and media production students. Part of the building is dedicated to computer science teaching and research. It includes high-tech equipment for software engineering and games development. The Creative Centre also includes a large auditorium for live performances.

=== Foss Building ===
In 2022 new spaces were developed in the existing Foss building to provide enhanced facilities for nu[NS1] [SC2] rsing, biomedical science, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and paramedic science. The facilities include consultation rooms, specialist camera and audio systems, and simulation spaces.

=== York St John University Sports Park ===

The university&#x27;s main sports facilities are at the Sports Park on Haxby Road, one mile from the city centre. The university acquired the site in 2012. A multi-million-pound redevelopment included the creation of a 3G pitch for football and rugby league. The facilities at the site also include grass pitches, outdoor tennis courts, sprint track, sports barn and strength and conditioning suites.

In January 2021, three new indoor tennis courts were opened which are available for public use. The Sports Park is used as the training facilities for York Knights and as part of £1 million investment a 4G pitch matching the specifications of York Community Stadium was built. During the 2021 Rugby League World Cup the sports park hosted the Cook Islands women&#x27;s team and was the venue for the warm-up match between the York Valkyrie and the Papua New Guinea Orchids on 20 October 2022.

===Fountains Learning Centre===

The Fountains Learning Centre, opened in 2004, is at the Clarence Street entrance to the campus. It provides access to resources of all kinds including books, journals, DVDs and videos, media equipment, approximately 400 computers and a 200-seat lecture theatre.

===De Grey Court===
York St John University&#x27;s £15.5 million De Grey Court was designed by leading architects Charles Thomson of Rivington Street Studio Architects in London. It has won many plaudits, including the highly lauded Lord Mayor&#x27;s York Design Award and a Royal Institute of British Architects award.

=== London campus ===
In 2018 York St John University&#x27;s London campus opened, offering various postgraduate programmes in Business Management and Computer Science. The London campus is located near the East India DLR station.

==Academic profile==

===Courses===
Around 100 degree course options are available to students at foundation and undergraduate level, including biomedical science, computer science, nursing, film and television production (see filmmaking), media production, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, literature, linguistics, Japanese, Korean, British Sign Language (BSL), psychology, counselling, business management, marketing, tourism, sociology, criminology, law, professional policing, video game design, history, creative writing, music, music production, art, design, geography, politics, theatre, dance, sport, theology and primary education.

Over 30% of research was ranked as world-leading and internationally excellent in the last Research Excellence Framework (REF) review.

=== Institute for Social Justice ===
The York St John University Institute for Social Justice was launched in 2020 to support the university&#x27;s mission &quot;to stand up for social justice&quot;. The Institute works with people, partners and communities to address the inequalities facing society today.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
York St John University was ranked 13th in the Times Higher Education Guide 2023.

York St John University rose to 84th in the Guardian University Guide in 2023. In the National Student Survey 2022, the university was ranked 30th of 122 English Higher Education providers for overall student satisfaction. York St John University is in the top 10 UK universities for giving equal access to students from all backgrounds.

=== Scholarships ===
The university has a newly developed set of scholarships for 2021 which include specific scholarships for: students from low income families, students who are from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, students who are carers, students whose parents or guardians have died serving their country in the Armed Forces and students who are seeking asylum or with Limited Leave to Remain in the UK.

==Students&#x27; Union==

The YSJ Students&#x27; Union (YSJSU), is associated with nearly 50 clubs and societies, covering activities and interests such as sports, languages, music, drama, religion and art. The Students&#x27; Union is led by three full-time sabbatical officers: SU President, President of Education and President of Wellbeing and Diversity. There are also a number of part-time officers including chairs of schools and liberation officers. The Students&#x27; Union building houses space for students to socialise and create committees.

===Community initiatives===
In 2021, the Students&#x27; Union launched the &quot;Throw it our way&quot; community campaign. In partnership with Mind, Oxfam, RSCPA and the York Community Furniture Store, the campaign aimed to reduce waste being created when students moved out of their accommodation and redistribute items to those in need.

In April 2021, following the easing of some of the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, the YSJSU launched the campaign &quot;Reconnect the right way.&quot; The campaign aimed to normalise social anxiety, support local businesses and give advice on how to stay safe on nights out.

In 2005, the Students&#x27; Union launched another community-friendly campaign called &#x27;Pick It Up&#x27;. This campaign was designed to reduce litter levels on campus and in the surrounding community.

In 2002, a campaign entitled &quot;SSHH – Silent Students Happy Homes&quot; was initiated to combat local residents&#x27; concerns about studentification. This has subsequently been adopted by other Students&#x27; Unions around the UK, although in many instances the expansion of the abbreviation has been dropped, leaving campaigns called &quot;Shh&quot;, &quot;Sshh&quot;, or variants.

=== Awards ===
In 2020, the Students&#x27; Union received a Silver Award from Investors in People.

In 2017, they attained an accreditation through &quot;Quality Students&#x27; Unions&quot; - a quality framework run by the National Union of Students.

In June 2014, the Students&#x27; Union was short listed for Small and Specialist Students&#x27; Union of the Year at the annual NUS Awards.

In 2012 the Students&#x27; Union was awarded silver in the Students&#x27; Union Evaluation Initiative, making it the only small Students&#x27; Union in the country to receive the award.

In October 2009 the Student Union was awarded a Bronze Students&#x27; Union Evaluation Initiative award, one of 16 institutions to receive this accolade. Awards are made from bronze (lowest) to gold (highest). The scheme is administered by a former manager of Sheffield University Student Union. Currently Sheffield University shares the gold award with the nearby Leeds University.

===Sports===
The Students&#x27; Union has many sports clubs.

York St John University Rowing Club was founded 11 years after the college in 1852 and caters for all levels of experience; from competent rowers to complete beginners.

As of academic year 2018–19, the biggest club is the dance club, which stands at 119 members, of which 18 compete at a national level. The club offers 10 types of classes (including ballet, jazz and street) to all its members and six to those on the competition team.

The football club plays at Heworth Green: one team competes under the name York St John University in the York Football League (they are currently in the Premier Division of that league system); their reserve team also feature in Reserve Division A, which is the top reserve league. Its origins date back to 1872 when J. Morton persuaded the Sports Association to take up association football.

The cricket club is probably the oldest club – the first record of cricket being played was in 1848, seven years after the opening of the Training College. The club has strong links with its Old Johns Cricket Association, whose president was ex-student Harry Gration.

The hockey club is one of the biggest clubs within the university, offering 1st and 2nd men&#x27;s and ladies teams and a mixed team. The men&#x27;s 1st team are the last ever BUSA National Plate champions, having won the competition in 2008.

The badminton club is also present and represents York St John in BUCS too.

As of 2019, students formed an esports society and teams formed in titles such as, Overwatch, League of Legends, and CSGO.

===Societies===
YSJSU houses around 30 different societies ranging from Musical Production, Drama, Geek Society, and course based societies too such as Physiotherapy, Geography, Primary Education and many more. The societies work together on many projects in the year and all have the opportunity to win the title of Society of year at the annual Societies Awards Dinner.

===Democratic structures===
As of September 2016, the Students&#x27; Union moved to a new democratic structure in order to further student engagement with the Union. The Students&#x27; Union is led by a student executive of twelve, including three full-time officer trustees and nine chairs of schools representing each of the university schools. The current president of York St John Students&#x27; Union is Tim Holmes. The current president of education is Jenny Marchant. The current president of wellbeing and diversity is Kirsten Jolley.

The executive all hold seats on the Student Council (previously Senate) and the other seats are filled by elected members of each of the six Students&#x27; Union &#x27;Zones&#x27; (student forums).

Any student can submit a motion to the Student Council on any issue regarding life at university. The motion is then debated by members of Senate and either passed or not passed as policy.

== Community links ==

=== Public events ===
The university regularly hosts in person and virtual lectures, discussions, art displays and presentations for the public to attend.

=== York St John Communities Centre ===
Founded in 2016 and based on the university campus, the Communities Centre offers counselling, support groups and drop-in sessions for local residents. It also conducts research into mental health issues. Specialist areas are bereavement and domestic abuse. The Centre regularly collaborates with the Independent Domestic Abuse Services (IDAS).

<text>Rudolf von Ribbentrop (11 May 1921 – 20 May 2019) was a German Waffen-SS officer who served and was decorated in World War II, and later became a wine merchant. His father was Nazi diplomat and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. His autobiography gave further insight to his father and the last days of Adolf Hitler.

==Early life==
Rudolf von Ribbentrop was born in Wiesbaden as one of five children to Joachim von Ribbentrop. His father was appointed as German Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1936 and was accompanied to London by Rudolf. Enrolled into Westminster School, he had to later return to a boarding school in Germany after The Times became aware of his presence.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, when the Second World War started, Ribbentrop joined as a private soldier in the SS-Infantry Regiment &quot;Deutschland&quot;, with which he served during the Western Campaign, receiving the Iron Cross second class. During Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, his unit was sent to Finland. In February 1943 he was assigned to a Panzer regiment the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler division (LSSAH) and sent to Kharkov in February 1943, where he took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov.

Ribbentrop was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 15 July 1943. On 1 August he was transferred to the newly formed SS Division Hitlerjugend as a training officer and company commander. During battles in Normandy, Ribbentrop was awarded the German Cross in Gold. Following the breakout from Falaise, he saw action during Battle of the Bulge. He surrendered with the division to the U.S. Army on 8 May 1945. Ribbentrop was “taken aback” by the American artillery barrages in Normandy: “The Americans threw everything at us, particularly artillery … it put everything that we had previously undergone into the shade”.

==Post-war==
Ribbentrop spent over three years in American, British, and French custody. While in custody, he was accused of shooting two Canadian prisoners of war, one of them fatally, during an interrogation in France. However, the charges could not be proven. Ribbentrop was released from Cherche-Midi Prison in July 1948. Afterwards, he became a wine merchant and wrote his memoirs. These gave fresh insight into the career of his father and also an insight in the final days of Adolf Hitler. His work included previously unpublished photographs of his family and Hitler.

<doc id="696953" wikidata="Q450467" url="?curid=696953" title="Edward MacDowell">
<text>Edward Alexander MacDowell (December 18, 1860January 23, 1908) was an American composer and pianist of the late Romantic period. He was best known for his second piano concerto and his piano suites &quot;Woodland Sketches&quot;, &quot;Sea Pieces&quot; and &quot;New England Idylls&quot;. &quot;Woodland Sketches&quot; includes his most popular short piece, &quot;To a Wild Rose&quot;. In 1904 he was one of the first seven Americans honored by membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Studies==
Edward MacDowell was born in New York City to Thomas MacDowell, a Manhattan milk dealer, and Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Mary Knapp. He received his first piano lessons from Juan Buitrago, a Colombian violinist who was living with the MacDowell family at the time. He also received music lessons from friends of Buitrago, including the Cuban pianist Pablo Desverine and Venezuelan pianist and composer Teresa Carreño. MacDowell&#x27;s mother decided to take her son to Paris, France, where in 1877 he was admitted to the Paris Conservatory after receiving a competitive scholarship for international students.

After two years of studies under Antoine François Marmontel and being at the top of his class, he continued his education at Dr. Hoch&#x27;s Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, where he studied piano with Carl Heymann and composition with Joachim Raff. When Franz Liszt and Clara Schumann visited the conservatory in early 1880 and attended a recital of student compositions, MacDowell performed Robert Schumann&#x27;s Quintet, Op. 44 along with a transcription of a Liszt symphonic poem. The next year, he paid a visit to Liszt in Weimar and performed some of his own compositions. Liszt recommended MacDowell&#x27;s First Modern Suite, Op. 10 to Allgemeiner Deutscher Musikverein for performance and also introduced him to Leipzig music publishers at Breitkopf &amp; Härtel.

After finishing his studies in 1881, MacDowell remained for a while in Germany, where he composed, performed on stage and gave piano lessons. He taught piano at various places in Darmstadt during 1881–1884, including the &#x27; (now known as the &#x27;), and in Wiesbaden, 1884–1888.

==Marriage and family==
In 1884, MacDowell married Marian Griswold Nevins, an American who had been one of his piano students in Frankfurt for three years. About the time that MacDowell composed a piano piece titled &quot;Cradle Song&quot;, Marian suffered an illness that resulted in her being unable to bear children.

==Career==

In Germany, the MacDowells settled first in Frankfurt, then in Darmstadt, and finally, in Wiesbaden. From 1885 to 1888, MacDowell devoted himself almost exclusively to composition. That brought financial difficulties, and he decided to return to the United States in the autumn of 1888. He made Boston his new home, where he became well known as a concert pianist and piano teacher. He performed in recitals with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and other American musical organizations.

The MacDowells lived in Boston until 1896, when Edward was appointed professor of music at Columbia University, the first music professor in the university&#x27;s history. He was personally invited to Columbia University by its president Seth Low to create a music department. He stayed at Columbia until 1904. In addition to composing and teaching, from 1896 to 1898 he directed the Mendelssohn Glee Club. MacDowell composed some music for the group to perform.

In 1896, Marian MacDowell purchased Hillcrest Farm, to serve as their summer residence in Peterborough, New Hampshire. MacDowell found his creativity flourished in the beautiful rural setting. His compositions included two piano concertos, two orchestral suites, four symphonic poems, four piano sonatas, piano suites, and songs. He also published dozens of piano transcriptions of mostly 18th century pre-piano keyboard pieces.

From 1896 to 1898, MacDowell also published 13 piano pieces and 4 part songs under the pseudonym of Edgar Thorn. These compositions were not mentioned in Lawrence Gilman&#x27;s 1909 biography of MacDowell. They were listed without opus numbers in MacDowell&#x27;s &quot;Critical and Historical Essays&quot; (1912) and in John F. Porte&#x27;s &quot;Edward MacDowell&quot; (1922). They were listed with opus numbers in Oscar Sonneck&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of First Editions of Edward MacDowell&quot; (1917).

MacDowell was also a noted teacher of the piano and music composition. His students included James Dunn, E. Ray Goetz, Frances Tarbox and John Pierce Langs, a student from Buffalo, New York, with whom he became very close friends. Langs was also close to noted Canadian pianist Harold Bradley, and both championed MacDowell&#x27;s piano compositions. The linguist Edward Sapir was also among his students.

MacDowell was often stressed in his position at Columbia University, due to both administrative duties and growing conflict with the new university president Nicholas Murray Butler around a proposed two-course requirement in fine arts for all undergraduate students, as well as creation of combined Department of Fine Arts overseeing music, sculpture, painting and comparative literature. After Butler stripped the academic affairs voting rights of Columbia faculty members in the arts and accused MacDowell of unprofessional conduct and sloppy teaching, in February 1904, MacDowell abruptly announced his resignation, raising an unfortunate public controversy.

After stepping down from Columbia professorship, MacDowell fell into depression and his health rapidly deteriorated. E. Douglas Bomberger&#x27;s biography notes that MacDowell suffered from seasonal affective disorder throughout his life, and often made decisions with negative implications in the darkest months of the year. Bomberger advances a new theory for the sudden decline of MacDowell&#x27;s health: bromide poisoning, which was sometimes mistaken for paresis at the time, as was the case with MacDowell&#x27;s death certificate. Indeed, MacDowell had long suffered from insomnia, for which bromides were the standard treatment, and bromides were used in many common remedies of the day. MacDowell also was in contact with bromides through his hobby of photography.

A 1904 accident in which MacDowell was run over by a Hansom cab on Broadway may have contributed to his growing psychiatric disorder and resulting dementia. Of his final years, Lawrence Gilman, a contemporary, wrote: &quot;His mind became as that of a little child. He sat quietly, day after day, in a chair by a window, smiling patiently from time to time at those about him, turning the pages of a book of fairy tales that seemed to give him a definite pleasure, and greeting with a fugitive gleam of recognition certain of his more intimate friends&quot;.

The Mendelssohn Glee Club raised money to help the MacDowells. Friends launched a public appeal to raise funds for his care; among the signers were Horatio Parker, Victor Herbert, Arthur Foote, George Whitefield Chadwick, Frederick Converse, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, New York Mayor Seth Low, and former President Grover Cleveland.
Marian MacDowell cared for her husband to the end of his life. In 1907, the composer and his wife founded MacDowell (artists&#x27; residency and workshop) (formerly known as The MacDowell Colony) by deeding the Hillcrest Farm to the newly established Edward MacDowell Association. MacDowell died in 1908 in New York City and was buried at his beloved Hillcrest Farm.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1896, Princeton University awarded MacDowell an honorary degree of Doctor of Music. In 1899, he was elected as the president of the Society of American Musicians and Composers (New York). In 1904, he became one of the first seven people chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. After this experience, the MacDowells envisioned establishing a residency for artists near their summer home in Peterborough, New Hampshire.

The MacDowell (artists&#x27; residency and workshop), a multidisciplinary artists&#x27; retreat, continued to honor the composer&#x27;s memory after his death by supporting the work of other artists in an interdisciplinary environment. With time, it created an important part of MacDowell&#x27;s legacy. Marian MacDowell led the Edward MacDowell Association and Colony for more than 25 years, strengthening its initial endowment by resuming her piano performances and creating a wide circle of donors, especially among women&#x27;s clubs and musical sororities and around 400 MacDowell music clubs. The Edward MacDowell Association backed many American composers, including Aaron Copland, Edgard Varese, Roger Sessions, William Schuman, Walter Piston, Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter, and Leonard Bernstein, in the beginning phases of their careers by awarding them residencies, fellowships, and the Edward MacDowell Medal. Between 1925 and 1956, Copland received a fellowship eight times; in 1961 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal, and he served himself for 34 years on the board of Association and Colony. Amy Beach was at MacDowell on fellowships from its beginning for many summers while she was in her middle to later career.

After his death, MacDowell was considered a great, internationally known American composer. In 1940, MacDowell was one of five American composers honored in a series of United States postage stamps. The other four composers were Stephen Foster, John Philip Sousa, Victor Herbert, and Ethelbert Nevin. However, as the twentieth century progressed, his fame was eclipsed by such American composers as Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, and Roy Harris. In 1950s, Gilbert Chase, an American music historian and critic, wrote, &quot;When Edward MacDowell appeared on the scene, many Americans felt that here at last was &#x27;the great American composer&#x27; awaited by the nation. But MacDowell was not a great composer. At his best he was a gifted miniaturist with an individual manner. Creatively, he looked toward the past, not toward the future. He does not mark the beginning of a new epoch in American music, but the closing of a fading era, the &quot;fin de siecle&quot; decline of the genteel tradition which had dominated American art since the days of Hopkinson and Hewitt&quot;. In the 1970s, John Gillespie reaffirmed Chase&#x27;s opinion by writing that MacDowell&#x27;s place in time &quot;accounts for his decreasing popularity; he does not belong with the great Romantics, Schumann and Brahms, but neither can be regarded as a precursor of twentieth century music&quot;. Other critics, such as Virgil Thomson, maintained that MacDowell&#x27;s legacy would be reconsidered and regain a place proper to its significance in the history of American music.

As romantic tradition in music never lost its relevance and importance, the twenty-first century brought a reassessment of MacDowell&#x27;s legacy not only as a talented piano virtuoso and piano composer, but also as one of America&#x27;s preeminent composers. On February 14, 2000, he was inducted into a national Classical Music Hall of Fame. MacDowell&#x27;s two concertos are now perceived as the &quot;most important works in the genre by an American composer other than Gershwin&quot;. His four sonatas, two orchestral suites and multiple solo piano pieces are performed and recorded.

<doc id="696955" wikidata="Q1325769" url="?curid=696955" title="Antisymmetric tensor">
<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a tensor is antisymmetric on (or with respect to) an index subset if it alternates sign (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged. The index subset must generally either be all &quot;covariant&quot; or all &quot;contravariant&quot;.

For example,
formula_1
holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.

If a tensor changes sign under exchange of &quot;each&quot; pair of its indices, then the tensor is completely (or totally) antisymmetric. A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor field of order formula_2 may be referred to as a differential formula_2-form, and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor field may be referred to as a formula_2-vector field.

==Antisymmetric and symmetric tensors==

A tensor A that is antisymmetric on indices formula_5 and formula_6 has the property that the contraction with a tensor B that is symmetric on indices formula_5 and formula_6 is identically 0.

For a general tensor U with components formula_9 and a pair of indices formula_5 and formula_11 U has symmetric and antisymmetric parts defined as:
 
Similar definitions can be given for other pairs of indices. As the term &quot;part&quot; suggests, a tensor is the sum of its symmetric part and antisymmetric part for a given pair of indices, as in
formula_12

==Notation==

A shorthand notation for anti-symmetrization is denoted by a pair of square brackets. For example, in arbitrary dimensions, for an order 2 covariant tensor M,
formula_13
and for an order 3 covariant tensor T,
formula_14

In any 2 and 3 dimensions, these can be written as
formula_15
where formula_16 is the generalized Kronecker delta, and the Einstein summation convention is in use.

More generally, irrespective of the number of dimensions, antisymmetrization over formula_17 indices may be expressed as
formula_18

In general, every tensor of rank 2 can be decomposed into a symmetric and anti-symmetric pair as:
formula_19

This decomposition is not in general true for tensors of rank 3 or more, which have more complex symmetries.

==Examples==

Totally antisymmetric tensors include:

* Trivially, all scalars and vectors (tensors of order 0 and 1) are totally antisymmetric (as well as being totally symmetric).
* The electromagnetic tensor, formula_20 in electromagnetism.
* The Riemannian volume form on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

<text>The High North Alliance () is an umbrella organisation of several fishing, whaling and Nordic municipal councils. The organisation objectives are, it says, &quot;to protect the rights of whalers, sealers and fishermen to harvest renewable resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable management.&quot;

The alliance was founded in 1991 in response to calls from environmentalists to prohibit completely commercial whaling, and, from more radical groups, calls to prohibit the killing of marine mammals for any purpose. The alliance is organised by a governing committee of six members, three from Norway, and one each from the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. The alliance is funded by membership fees, and from grants from organisations such as the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (founded by Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands in 1992) and the Regional Development Committee for Northern Norway.

Activities of the Alliance include lobbying the largely sympathetic Norwegian government for increases in Norway&#x27;s whaling quota, promoting studies into methods of more humane whaling, lobbying the International Whaling Commission into relaxing the whaling moratorium, and responding to campaigns from anti-whaling groups such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and Greenpeace.

<text>John R. Beatty (born May 6, 1961, in Whitesburg, Kentucky) is an American illustrator who has worked for Marvel Comics and DC Comics, primarily as an inker.

==Biography==

Beatty was born in Letcher County, Kentucky; he lived there for less than a year when his family moved to Holly Hill, Florida, a small city located between Daytona Beach and Ormond Beach.

As a child, I discovered and fell in love with the comic strips &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and &quot;Peanuts&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until later that Beatty discovered superhero comic books when a friend who lived up the street sold him a box of comics for $20.00. Beatty&#x27;s goal was to become a comic book artist.

By the time he was 15 years old, Beatty had made his first &quot;professional sell,&quot; as Camelot Publishing hired him to do cartoons for computer instruction manuals. This gig turned into after-school employment during Beatty&#x27;s high school years. He graduated from Mainland Senior High School in 1979.

Not long after he discovered the world of fanzines, Beatty wrote and drew a short comic story starring the hero &quot;Crime Smasher,&quot; which was printed in Tim Corrigan&#x27;s &quot;Super Hero Comics&quot;. Jerry Ordway had a story published in the same issue, and Ordway was also starting up his self-published comic book, titled &quot;OK Comics!&quot; Soon Beatty and Ordway began communicating through the mail. Beatty also connected with artist Mike Zeck, through the &quot;pro-zine&quot; &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot;. Zeck encouraged Beatty, and even sent xeroxed pencils of his work to Beatty, so he could ink samples for practice and critiques.

Beatty had, for a couple of years, been going to OrlandoCon, an annual comic book convention held in Orlando, Florida. Beatty and his long-time friend Craig Zablo (creator of Stallonezone, a Sylvester Stallone fansite), would go to OrlandoCon and make a weekend of it. On this particular occasion, Beatty took some art samples to show professional attendees, comics artists such as Pat Broderick and Bob McLeod (who were living on the west coast of Florida in Tampa). This was also the con where Beatty met AC Comics publisher and artist Bill Black. Beatty showed samples to Black and was offered ink work on the spot; he would get to ink Black&#x27;s pencils at a rate of $7.00 per page.

Beatty&#x27;s career began to take shape: Bob McLeod tagged him to start doing some assistant work, such as filling in blacks and erasing pages; he also occasionally drew backgrounds for McLeod&#x27;s pages.

It was now 1980. Beatty went to the annual MiamiCon and showed Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter new samples of his work. (Shooter had reviewed Beatty&#x27;s work the previous year and said Beatty was not quite ready.) Shooter looked over Beatty&#x27;s art and said: &quot;If you can come up to New York, I&#x27;ll give you a paid tryout to work on.&quot; In July 1980, Beatty made the journey, and with the help of Mike Zeck got some gigs from both Marvel and DC.

Beatty spent twenty years inking titles such as &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, &quot;The Nam&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;JLA&quot;, and many more.

Beatty has also worked for the DC Comics Licensing Department, where style guide art is created. This art is used for many things, including package design, clothing, and other licensed products that DC supplies its vendors.

==Bibliography==
Comics work includes:
*&quot;New Mutants&quot; vol. 1 #50 (inker)
*&quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 1 #265, 267–283, 286–289, 321–323, 326, 327 vol.3 #5
*&quot;Secret Wars&quot; # 1–12
*&quot;Punisher&quot; # 1–5

<text>Pagan Kennedy (born c. 1963) is an American columnist and author, and pioneer of the 1990s zine movement.

She has written ten books in a variety of genres, was a regular contributor to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and has published articles in dozens of magazines and newspapers. In 2012–13, she was a &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; columnist.

==Early life and education==
Born Pamela Kennedy around 1963, she grew up in suburban Washington, D.C. She graduated from Wesleyan University in 1984, and later spent a year in the Masters of Fine Arts program at Johns Hopkins University.

==Career==
Kennedy&#x27;s autobiographical zine &quot;Pagan&#x27;s Head&quot; detailed her life during her twenties.

In 2007, Kennedy wrote a biography called &quot;The First Man-Made Man&quot; about Michael Dillon, a British physician and author who in the mid-1940s became the first successful case of female-to-male sex change treatment that included a phalloplasty (the surgical construction of a penis).

In July 2012, Kennedy was named design columnist for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. Her column, &quot;Who Made That&quot;, detailed the origins of a wide variety of things, such as the cubicle and the home pregnancy test. Kennedy resigned from the column after signing a contract with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to write a book, &quot;Inventology&quot;.

In 2020, Kennedy&#x27;s investigation into the history of the first rape kit written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Rape Kit&#x27;s Secret History&quot;, received national media attention. It led to a revival of interest surrounding Marty Goddard&#x27;s story, including the auction of an early rape kit at Sotheby&#x27;s. Kennedy went on to write a full-length book about the rape kit, which is forthcoming from Vintage Books in 2025. 

===Teaching===

<text>Eatonia is a town in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan with a population of 449 people (according to the Canada 2006 Census). The town&#x27;s economy is based almost exclusively on agriculture. Eatonia is in southwest Saskatchewan at the crossroads of Highways 21 and 44, approximately 44 kilometres southwest of Kindersley and 72 kilometres from the provincial boundary with Alberta. The town is served by Eatonia (Elvie Smith) Municipal Airport.

== History ==

Eatonia was founded in 1919 as a station on the Canadian National Railway and was named after Timothy Eaton, founder of the Eaton&#x27;s department store chain and catalogue, and to honour his son and heir, John Craig Eaton. The station was originally simply called &quot;Eaton&quot;, but there was confusion with nearby Eston, so the name was changed to Eatonia in 1921 (&quot;Eatonia&quot; was the name of an Eaton&#x27;s brand for clothing and other goods, and &quot;Eatonian&quot; was the name given to long-serving Eaton&#x27;s employees).

Eatonia was incorporated as a town in 1954. In 1955, the year of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Eatonia&#x27;s train station was featured on the cover of the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue, thus resulting in a classic local image finding its way into homes across the country. The former CN train station is now home to the Wheatland Regional Library (Eatonia Branch). The former station, along with a train caboose and a wood-frame house ordered from the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue in 1917, comprise the Eatonia Heritage Park, a Municipal Heritage Property located at the south end of Main Street.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Eatonia had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Education==
Eatonia is home to a kindergarten to Grade 12 public school, Eaton School, which has been home to many successful volleyball, basketball, and football teams throughout its history. It is located within the Sun West School Division.

<doc id="696986" wikidata="Q1494444" url="?curid=696986" title="Assistive cane">
<text>An assistive cane is a walking stick used as a crutch or mobility aid. A cane can help redistribute weight from a lower leg that is weak or painful, improve stability by increasing the base of support, and provide tactile information about the ground to improve balance. In the US, ten percent of adults older than 65 years use a cane, and 4.6 percent use walkers.

In contrast to crutches, canes are generally lighter, but, because they transfer the load through the user&#x27;s unsupported wrist, are unable to offload equal loads from the legs.

Another type of crutch is the walker, a frame held in front of the user and which the user leans on during movement. Walkers are more stable due to their increased area of ground contact, but are larger and less wieldy and, like canes, pass the full load through the user&#x27;s wrists in most cases.

== Parts of medical canes ==

The basic cane has four parts. These parts vary depending on the design of the cane and the needs of the user.
* Handle. The handle of a cane is extremely important to the user. Many different styles exist, the most common traditional designs are the Tourist (or Crook) handle, the Fritz Handle and the Derby Handle. Ergonomically shaped handles have become increasingly common for canes intended for medical use, both increasing the comfort of the grip for the user (particularly important for users with disabilities which also affect their hands or wrists), and better transmitting the load from the user&#x27;s hand and arm into the shaft.
* Collar. The collar of a cane may be only a decorative addition made for stylistic reasons, or may form the structural interface between shaft and handle.
* Shaft. The shaft of the cane transmits the load from the handle to the ferrule and may be constructed from carbon fiber polymer, metal, composites, or traditional wood.
* Ferrule. The tip of a cane provides traction and added support when the cane is used at an angle. Many kinds of ferrules exist, but most common is a simple, ridged rubber stopper. Users can easily replace a ferrule with one that better suits their individual needs.

Modern canes may differ from the traditional fixed structure. For instance, a quad cane has a base attached to the shaft that provides increased stability by having four ferrules, and an adjustable cane may have two shaft segments telescoping one inside the other to allow adjustment for multiple sizes.

All cane users who need a walking cane for medical reasons should consult a medical professional before choosing the style that best suits them. It is particularly important that the cane be the proper height for the individual user.

==Length and user weight==

For use as a walking aid, it is usually recommended that the length of the stick should be such that the top of the handle reaches the wrist joint when standing up with arms hanging, wearing the footwear to be used with the stick.

Sticks are rated according to the weight they can bear; this is not just a matter of the weight of the user, but depends upon whether the stick is used for light balance and support, or with a great deal of weight placed on the stick. Canes made of carbon fiber or aluminium are stronger than those of the same weight made of other materials such as hardwood.

== Types of canes ==
*White cane: specifically designed for assisting the visually impaired, these are longer and thinner and allow the user to &quot;feel&quot; the path ahead. They also alert others, such as motorists, that the user is blind and should be regarded with caution. In the UK, red banding on a white cane indicates a deaf-blind user.
*Folding cane: has several joints, generally linked by an internal elastic cord, enabling them to be folded into a shorter length when not in use.
*Forearm cane: a regular or offset cane with additional forearm support, enabling increased stability and load shifted from the wrist to the forearm.
*Quad cane: has four ferrules at the base, enabling them to stand freely, and offering a more firm base for standing.
*Tripod cane: opens in a tripod fashion. Often available with an attached seat.
*Adjustable cane: features two or more shaft pieces for a telescoping effect that allows the user to lengthen or shorten their walking cane to fit to size. This feature can be combined with other variations.
*Shillelagh: a cane made of blackthorn wood with a knob at the top and usable as a weapon, originating in Ireland and still a recognized symbol thereof.

== Accessories ==
* The most common accessory is a hand strap, to prevent loss of the stick should the hand release its grip. These aides are then threaded through a hole drilled into the stick rather than tied around.
* A clip-on frame or similar device can be used to hold a stick against the top of a table.
* In cold climates, a metallic cleat may be added to the foot of the cane. This dramatically increases traction on ice. The device is usually designed so it can easily rotate to the side to prevent damage to indoor flooring.
* Different handles are available to better match the size of the user&#x27;s hands and their medical needs.
* Rubber ferrules give extra traction on most surfaces.

== Handedness ==
Canes are generally held in the hand that is opposite to the side of the injury or weakness. It allows the cane to be used for stability in a way that lets the user focus much of their weight away from their weaker side and onto the cane. This prevents the person&#x27;s center of balance from swaying from side to side as they walk. It also allows for fluid movement that better matches walking, as the hand on the opposite side of the leg generally sways forward in normal human locomotion. Due to personal preference or a need to hold the cane in the dominant hand, some cane users hold the cane on the same side as the affected leg.

<text>Little Ben is a cast iron miniature clock tower, situated at the intersection of Vauxhall Bridge Road and Victoria Street, in Westminster, central London, close to the approach to Victoria station. In design it mimics the famous clock tower colloquially known as Big Ben at the Palace of Westminster, found at the other end of Victoria Street.

Little Ben was manufactured, according to Pevsner, by Gillett &amp; Johnston of Croydon, and was erected in 1892; removed from the site in 1964, and restored and re-erected in 1981 by Westminster City Council with sponsorship from Elf Aquitaine Ltd &quot;offered as a gesture of Franco-British friendship&quot;.

There is a rhyming couplet &quot;Apology for Summer Time&quot; signed &quot;J.W.R.&quot; affixed to the body of the clock:

The couplet is a reference to the plan that the clock be permanently on Daylight Saving Time leading to the time being correct for France during the winter months and correct for the UK during the summer. However this policy was either changed, or never implemented, since recently it is on GMT in winter and BST in summer like all other clocks in Great Britain.

А replica of Little Ben called &quot;Lorloz&quot; (painted silver) was erected in 1903 in the centre of Victoria, capital of Seychelles to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897.

Little Ben was removed in 2012 and put in storage during upgrade works to London Victoria station. The timepiece was refurbished and the clock tower was reinstalled on 28 February 2016.

Little Ben was listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England in December 1987.

<doc id="697002" wikidata="Q3841885" url="?curid=697002" title="Maakies">
<text>Maakies is a comic strip by Tony Millionaire. It began publication in February 1994 in the &quot;New York Press&quot;. It has previously run in many American alternative newsweeklies including &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and &quot;Only&quot;. It has also appeared in several international venues including the Italian comics magazine &quot;Linus&quot; and the Swedish comics magazine &quot;Rocky&quot;.

On December 14, 2016, Tony Millionaire announced that &quot;Maakies&quot; had ended. One of the reasons he stated for discontinuing the strip was that many of the weekly papers that carried the strip were no longer in business.

On May 19, 2021, Tony Millionaire announced that weekly strips were being published again.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Maakies&quot; focuses on the darkly comic misadventures of Uncle Gabby (a &quot;drunken Irish monkey&quot;) and Drinky Crow (a crow), two antiheroes with a propensity for drunkenness, violence, suicide, and venereal disease. According to Millionaire, &quot;&quot;Maakies&quot; is me spilling my guts... Writing and drawing about all the things that make me want to jump in the river, laughing at the horror of being alive.&quot;

&quot;Maakies&quot; strips typically take place in an early 19th-century nautical setting. There is rarely any continuity between strips. The comic often includes visual references to historic works of art, especially to the popular graphic arts such as Japanese &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, European engravings, and early American newspaper comics.

Like many early 20th century Sunday strips, each &quot;Maakies&quot; comic usually includes a second, smaller strip (known as a &quot;topper&quot;) that runs along the bottom of the main strip. Tiny landscape drawings are interspersed between the panels of these strips. Also, a tugboat (referred to once as &quot;the enigmatic Maakies tug&quot;) appears somewhere in the background of virtually every strip.

==Meaning of the title==
Millionaire has given differing accounts of the origin and meaning of the word &quot;maakies.&quot; &quot;Maak&quot; is the name of a character in the strip, a ship&#x27;s captain who apparently is Uncle Gabby&#x27;s employer, and in one sense the strip seems to be named after him. Discussing the strip&#x27;s development, Millionaire said &quot;I fleshed them [the characters] out as best I could at the time, knowing that they&#x27;d grow over time. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t call the strip Drinky Crow. I called it Maakies because I didn&#x27;t know who would become the most important characters as I went along.&quot;

However, on more than one occasion he has claimed that the true significance of the strip&#x27;s name is a strict secret: &quot;I can&#x27;t release that information until a certain person dies... Because he or she would be extremely pissed off to even know that that name was being used.&quot;

Elsewhere he has attributed the origin of the word to his friend Spike Vrusho: &quot;Some of the tugboats in New York harbor have a big M painted on the side of them and my friend Spike Vrusho used to say &quot;MAAKIES!&quot; in a high pitched screech every time he saw one.&quot;

==Dr. Terrence Ross==
Terrence Ross is a real-life friend of Tony Millionaire from Fort Greene who frequently appears as a character in &quot;Maakies&quot;. In the strip he is drawn as a mechanical lizard who wears a black cloak and hat and has the number &#x27;147&#x27; imprinted on his forehead; he claims this is his IQ. Sometimes he delivers a monologue or reads a poem of his own composition. Other times he introduces one of his sinister or bizarre trademarked inventions, such as a &quot;safety harness&quot; that ejects the wearer&#x27;s spinal column from their body using a cherry bomb and M-80s. The book collection &quot;Premillennial Maakies&quot; is dedicated to &quot;Terry Ross&quot;.

==Guest cartoonists==
Numerous episodes of &quot;Maakies&quot; have been drawn (and possibly written) by cartoonists other than Millionaire. The most frequent &quot;guest cartoonist&quot; is Millionaire&#x27;s nephew Curtis Sarkin, who drew the strip in a child&#x27;s unsteady scrawl; his daughter and nieces have also made occasional contributions. One &quot;Maakies&quot; strip reprinted, in the original German, four panels of an illustrated poem by Wilhelm Busch dated 1867 and featuring the accidental demise of Hans Huckebein, an inebriated, Drinky Crow-like bird; in another, Millionaire illustrated a poem about the sea written by M Otis Beard, and dated it a century prior to the actual date on which the poem was penned. On another occasion, after Millionaire had drawn a comic featuring a stereotypical Native American character, &quot;Maakies&quot; ran a rebuttal strip by Tania Willard of the Secwepemc Nation lambasting Millionaire, his characters, and his editor.

A pair of &quot;Maakies&quot; strips are purportedly drawn by Drinky Crow and Uncle Gabby (who passed out in the middle of drawing his).

All the &quot;Maakies&quot; collections are published by Fantagraphics Books and designed by Chip Kidd. All but the first of the books are hardcover, printed in an unusual format that preserves the dimensions of Millionaire&#x27;s original drawings.

With the exception of the first collection and its hardcover reprint, the title of each of the &quot;Maakies&quot; books refers to a classic children&#x27;s book – A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; and &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, Heinrich Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot;, Johnny Gruelle&#x27;s &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees&quot;, and Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little House On The Prairie&quot;.

==Related works==
The characters of Uncle Gabby and Mr. Crow in Millionaire&#x27;s &quot;Sock Monkey&quot; comics and books are loosely connected to their &quot;Maakies&quot; counterparts. They make occasional appearances in the weekly strip.

A horsefly named Billy Hazelnuts appeared in an early &quot;Maakies&quot; strip. However, this character is unrelated to the titular character in Millionaire&#x27;s 2006 graphic novel &quot;Billy Hazelnuts&quot;.

The tiny hardcover book &quot;Mighty Mite The Ear Mite&quot; (2003, Fantagraphics Books) is based on recurring characters in &quot;Maakies&quot;.

Millionaire has occasionally drawn X-rated adaptations of his familiar &quot;Maakies&quot; characters (e.g. &quot;Shtuppi Eisberg, the Libidinous Penguin&quot; instead of Drinky Crow) for &quot;Screw&quot;, &quot;Legal Action Comics&quot; and other explicit venues.

==Animation==

Several short &quot;Maakies&quot; Flash animations were shown on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the late 1990s. Several more animations were produced but never broadcast. All of the &quot;Maakies&quot; Flash animations are included on the DVD collection &quot;God Hates Cartoons&quot;, published by Bright Red Rocket.

A &quot;Maakies&quot; short bridges the two-halves of the 2002 They Might Be Giants documentary &quot;Gigantic&quot;.

An animated television pilot for &quot;The Drinky Crow Show&quot;, based on the &quot;Maakies&quot; characters, premiered on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim on May 13, 2007.
Dino Stamatopoulos provided the voice of the titular character, and They Might Be Giants performed the show&#x27;s theme song. The show premiered on Adult Swim on November 23, 2008 and ran for one season containing ten episodes. It ended on January 25, 2009. The cancellation of the show was confirmed by a &quot;Maakies&quot; comic.

<doc id="697009" wikidata="Q7979905" url="?curid=697009" title="Weighted round robin">
<text>Weighted round robin (WRR) is a network scheduler for data flows, but also used to schedule processes.

Weighted round robin is a generalisation of round-robin scheduling. It serves a set of queues or tasks. Whereas round-robin cycles over the queues or tasks and gives one service opportunity per cycle, weighted round robin offers to each a fixed number of opportunities, as specified by the configured weight which serves to influence the portion of capacity received by each queue or task. In computer networks, a service opportunity is the emission of one packet, if the selected queue is non-empty.

If all packets have the same size, WRR is the simplest approximation of generalized processor sharing (GPS). Several variations of WRR exist. The main ones are the &quot;classical&quot; WRR, and the &quot;interleaved&quot; WRR.

== Algorithm ==

=== Principles ===

WRR is presented in the following as a network scheduler. It can also be used to schedule tasks in a similar way.

A weighted round-robin network scheduler has formula_1 input queues, formula_2. To each queue formula_3 is associated formula_4, a positive integer, called the &quot;weight&quot;. The WRR scheduler has a cyclic behavior. In each cycle, each queue formula_3 has formula_4 emissions opportunities.

The different WRR algorithms differ on the distributions of these opportunities in the cycle.

=== Classical WRR ===

In classical WRR
the scheduler cycles over the queues. When a queue formula_3 is selected, the scheduler will send packets, up to the emission of formula_4 packet or the end of queue.

=== Interleaved WRR ===

Let formula_9, be the maximum weight. In IWRR, each cycle is split into formula_10 rounds. A queue with weight formula_4 can emit one packet at round formula_12 only if formula_13.

=== Example ===

Consider a system with three queues formula_14 and respective weights formula_15. Consider a situation where there are 7 packets in the first queue, A,B,C,D,E,F,G, 3 in the second queue, U,V,W and 2 in the third queue X,Y. Assume that there is no more packet arrival.

With classical WRR, in the first cycle, the scheduler first selects formula_16 and transmits the five packets at head of queue,A,B,C,D,E (since formula_17), then it selects the second queue, formula_18, and transmits the two packets at head of queue, U,V (since formula_19), and last it selects the third queue, which has a weight equals to 3 but only two packets, so it transmits X,Y. Immediately after the end of transmission of Y, the second cycle starts, and F,G from formula_16 are transmitted, followed by W from formula_18.

With interleaved WRR, the first cycle is split into 5 rounds (since formula_22). In the first one (r=1), one packet from each queue is sent (A,U,X), in the second round (r=2), another packet from each queue is also sent (B,V,Y), in the third round (r=3), only queues formula_23 are allowed to send a packet (formula_24, formula_25 and formula_26), but since formula_27 is empty, only C from formula_16 is sent, and in the fourth and fifth rounds, only D,E from formula_16 are sent. Then starts the second cycle, where F,W,G are sent.

==Task scheduling==

Task or process scheduling can be done in WRR in a way similar to packet scheduling: when considering a set of formula_1 active tasks, they are scheduled in a cyclic way, each task formula_31 gets formula_4 quantum or slice of processor time

==Properties==

Like round-robin, weighted round robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, work conserving and starvation-free.

When scheduling packets, if all packets have the same size, then WRR and IWRR are an approximation of Generalized processor sharing: a queue formula_3 will receive a long term part of the bandwidth equals to formula_34 (if all queues are active) while GPS serves infinitesimal amounts of data from each nonempty queue and offer this part on any interval.

If the queues have packets of variable length, the part of the bandwidth received by each queue depends not only on the weights but also of the packets sizes.

If a mean packets size formula_35 is known for every queue formula_3, each queue will receive a long term part of the bandwidth equals to formula_37. If the objective is to give to each queue formula_3 a portion formula_39 of link capacity (with formula_40), one may set formula_41.

Since IWRR has smaller per class bursts than WRR, it implies smaller worst-case delays.

== Limitations and improvements ==
WRR for network packet scheduling was first proposed by Katevenis, Sidiropoulos and Courcoubetis in 1991, specifically for scheduling in ATM networks using fixed-size packets (cells). The primary limitation of weighted round-robin queuing is that it provides the correct percentage of bandwidth to each service class only if all the packets in all the queues are the same size or when the mean packet size is known in advance. In the more general case of IP networks with variable size packets, to approximate GPS the weight factors must be adjusted based on the packet size. That requires estimation of the average packet size, which makes a good GPS approximation hard to achieve in practice with WRR.

Deficit round robin is a later variation of WRR that achieves better GPS approximation without knowing the mean packet size of each connection in advance. More effective scheduling disciplines were also introduced which handle the limitations mentioned above (e.g. weighted fair queuing).

Bee was nominated by President George Washington on June 11, 1790, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina vacated by Judge William Drayton Sr. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 14, 1790, and received his commission the same day. He published reports of the district court in 1810. His service terminated on February 18, 1812, due to his death in Pendleton, South Carolina. He was interred in Woodstock Cemetery in Goose Creek, South Carolina.

Bee was nominated by President John Adams to be Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit on February 21, 1801, and was confirmed by the Senate on February 24, 1801, but he declined the appointment.

==Family==

Bee was the father of Barnard E. Bee Sr., who took part in the Texas Revolution and who was a political figure in the Republic of Texas, and the great grandfather of Carlos Bee, a United States representative from Texas. Two of Barnard&#x27;s sons became known as Confederate generals during the American Civil War: Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. and Hamilton P. Bee.

<text>In music, a counter-melody (often countermelody) is a sequence of notes, perceived as a melody, written to be played simultaneously with a more prominent lead melody. In other words, it is a secondary melody played in counterpoint with the primary melody. A counter-melody performs a subordinate role, and it is typically heard in a texture consisting of a melody plus accompaniment.

In marches, the counter-melody is often given to the trombones or horns. American composer David Wallis Reeves is credited with this innovation in 1876. 

The more formal term countersubject applies to a secondary or subordinate melodic idea in a fugue. A countermelody differs from a harmony part sung by a backup singer in that whereas the harmony part typically lacks its own independent musical line, a countermelody is a distinct melodic line.

<doc id="697026" wikidata="Q24785512" url="?curid=697026" title="SERCA">
<text>SERCA, or [[sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic]]/[[endoplasmic reticulum]] [[Calcium|Ca]]2+-[[ATPase]], or SR [[Calcium|Ca]]2+-[[ATPase]], is a calcium ATPase-type P-ATPase. Its major function is to transport calcium from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

==Function==
SERCA is a P-type ATPase. It resides in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) within myocytes. It is a Ca2+ ATPase that transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol of the cell to the lumen of the SR. This uses energy from ATP hydrolysis during muscle relaxation.

There are 3 major domains on the cytoplasmic face of SERCA: the phosphorylation and nucleotide-binding domains, which form the catalytic site, and the actuator domain, which is involved in the transmission of major conformational changes.

In addition to its calcium-transporting functions, SERCA1 generates heat in brown adipose tissue and in skeletal muscles. Along with the heat it naturally produces due to its inefficiency in pumping ions, when it binds to a regulator called sarcolipin it stops pumping and functions solely as an ATP hydrolase. This mechanism of thermogenesis is widespread in mammals and in endothermic fishes.

==Regulation==
The rate at which SERCA moves Ca2+ across the SR membrane can be controlled by the regulatory protein phospholamban (PLB/PLN). SERCA is not as active when PLB is bound to it. Increased β-adrenergic stimulation reduces the association between SERCA and PLB by the phosphorylation of PLB by PKA. When PLB is associated with SERCA, the rate of Ca2+ movement is reduced; upon dissociation of PLB, Ca2+ movement increases.

Activity regulation of SERCA can also involve phosphorylation of SERCA itself by interaction with GSK3β. Phosphorylation of SERCA2a at S663 was shown to reduce SERCA2a activity.

Another protein, calsequestrin, binds calcium within the SR and helps to reduce the concentration of free calcium within the SR, which assists SERCA so that it does not have to pump against such a high concentration gradient. The SR has a much higher concentration of Ca2+ (10,000x) inside when compared to the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. SERCA2 can be regulated by microRNAs, for instance miR-25 suppresses SERCA2 in heart failure.

For experimental purposes, SERCA can be inhibited by thapsigargin and induced by istaroxime.

SERCA function is upregulated in the skeletal muscle of rabbits and in rodent myocardium by thyroid hormones. This mechanism may contribute to the proarrhythmogenic effect of thyrotoxicosis.

==Paralogs==
There are 3 major paralogs, SERCA1-3, which are expressed at various levels in different cell types. 
* ATP2A1 – SERCA1
* ATP2A2 – SERCA2
* ATP2A3 – SERCA3

There are additional post-translational isoforms of both SERCA2 and SERCA3, which serve to introduce the possibility of cell-type-specific Ca2+-reuptake responses as well as increasing the overall complexity of the Ca2+ signaling mechanism.

<text>Eugene Lee-Hamilton (6 January 1845 – 9 September 1907) was a late Victorian English poet. His work includes some notable sonnets in the style of Petrarch. He endowed a literary prize administered by Oriel College in Oxford University, where he was a student. The prize is open to students of Oxford and of Cambridge University and continues to this day.

==Life and works==
Eugene Lee-Hamilton was born in London on 6 January 1845; his parents were James Lee-Hamilton, who died in 1852, and Matilda Abadam (1815–1896), daughter of Edward Hamlyn Adams.

Lee-Hamilton was educated mainly in France and Germany. In 1864 he was sent to the University of Oxford. In 1869 he entered the British diplomatic service. He was first attached to the Embassy at Paris, where, due to his early experiences of French life, and mastery of the French language, he was eminently suitable. After the Franco-German War broke out he took part in the Alabama arbitration at Geneva. Subsequently he was appointed secretary in the British Legation at Lisbon. He had to renounce this second position in 1873, when, suddenly, he collapsed altogether, losing the use of his legs, and suffering agonies of pain. He expressed it in one of his sonnets,

&quot;To keep through life the posture of the grave,
While others walk and run and dance and leap.&quot;

It was to while away the tedium arising out of this malady that he first took to composing verse. All of his poetry from this time was composed without his touching pen or paper, and subsequently dictated.

===Early poems===
Hamilton&#x27;s first miscellaneous poems appeared in 1878, and attracted no notice whatever; and it was only with the publication of &quot;The New Medusa&quot; that his poetry began to receive attention. This volume was followed, in 1885, by one entitled &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot;, and his next publication, entitled &quot;Imaginary Sonnets&quot;, came out in the fall of 1888. As a writer of sonnets he is most remarkable.

He spent much of his adult life suffering from psychological ailments.

He was nursed by his mother and sporadically by his half-sister, Violet Paget, who wrote under the name Vernon Lee. Lee-Hamilton lived with his mother and step-father in Florence, Italy, during his illness, and it was only after his mother died in 1896 and he recovered that he was able to travel again, eventually marrying the novelist Annie E. Holdsworth in 1898 and fathering a child, Persis Margaret, in 1903, but she died of meningitis in infancy. This led to him writing the poem, &quot;Mimma Bella; In Memory of a Little Life&quot;.

===Analysis===
Lee-Hamilton wrote in the tradition of shorter Victorian verse, particularly the dramatic sonnet. Robert Browning was an influence, but Lee-Hamilton refined the art of the dramatic monologue, and there is a restless imagination to his sonnets.

Certain motifs recur, such as submersion in water, being buried in the earth, being shackled, the conflict between body and mind, dark female archetypes such as the gorgon, and male archetypes such as the madman or the murderous lover. Lee-Hamilton has failures when an image or plot that loses force because it lacks restraint. His major works are his sonnets, and his successes depend on technical ability. He condensed the dramatic monologue into a sonnet format, and gained power, in sonnets that are concise and restrained.

&quot;Imaginary Sonnets&quot; (1888) drew on historical, mythic and imaginary figures: each spoken by a particular person at a definite time. Philip Hobsbaum (in &quot;Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form&quot;) suggests that Lee-Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Sonnets of the Wingless Hours&quot; (1894) is the only Victorian sonnet sequence that can compare to Gerard Manley Hopkins. In longer poems of collections such as &quot;the New Medusa&quot; (1882), there are narratives and dramatic monologues that explore the darker side of life; as in Browning, lust, jealousy, and fear predominate.

<text>Loie Fuller (; born Marie Louise Fuller; January 15, 1862 – January 1, 1928), also known as Louie Fuller and Loïe Fuller, was an American dancer and a pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting techniques.

==Early life and debut==
Marie Louise Fuller was born on January 15, 1862, in Fullersburg, Illinois, on a remote farm conveniently linked to Chicago by a newly-constructed plank road. When Fuller was two, her parents Reuben Fuller and Delilah Eaton moved to Chicago and opened a boarding house. Her early exposure to the arts came through her parents - her father was a skilled fiddler and dance caller, while her mother had aspired to be an opera singer before marriage. Fuller&#x27;s parents took her to the Progressive Lyceum, a hub of Freethought, on Sunday mornings.

Fuller debuted on the stage as a toddler, performing a variety of dramatic and dance roles in Chicago. Her first performance, according to her memoir, was reciting &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; at a Sunday school event. Her formal dramatic debut at the age of four was at the Chicago Academy of Music, playing a young boy in &quot;Was He Right?&quot;. Fuller&#x27;s career as a child performer progressed with little formal training and much variety, as she experimented with dramatic reading, singing, and dance. From 1878 to 1879, she toured with the Felix A. Vincent Company, performing in &quot;Aladdin,&quot; a pantomime spectacle filled with magical scene transformations. This experience exposed her to important principles of stagecraft. 

As a child, Fuller&#x27;s family moved in and out of Chicago, with Fuller eventually securing a part in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s touring act at the age of nineteen. From 1881 to 1889, Fuller performed in western melodramas and musical burlettas in New York City and the Midwest, with notable roles in &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (1882) and &quot;Twenty Days, or Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Pledge&quot; (1883).

Despite her initial success, Fuller faced significant financial challenges early in her career. In 1889, she attempted to expand her career by venturing into production, traveling to London to mount and star in the play &quot;Caprice.&quot; This endeavor proved to be both a critical and financial failure, leaving Fuller broke and unemployed in London. Following this setback, Fuller&#x27;s fortunes changed when she secured a role as an understudy at London&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre, known for its skirt dances. This engagement proved pivotal, as it exposed her to a dance form that would influence her later innovations.

Marie Louise Fuller changed her name to the more glamorous &quot;Loïe&quot; at the age of sixteen. An early free dance practitioner, Fuller developed her own natural movement and improvisation techniques. In 1889, Fuller visited the Paris Exposition Universelle, where she was particularly impressed by the Palais d&#x27;électricité and the illuminated fountains of the Champs de Mars, which later influenced her innovative use of lighting in her performances. In multiple shows she experimented with a long skirt, choreographing its movements and playing with the ways it could reflect light.

== Career ==
By 1891, Fuller combined her choreography with silk costumes illuminated by multi-coloured lighting of her own design, and created the &quot;Serpentine Dance&quot;. After much difficulty finding someone willing to produce her work when she was primarily known as an actress, she was finally hired to perform her piece between acts of a comedy entitled &quot;Uncle Celestine,&quot; and received rave reviews.


Almost immediately, she was replaced by imitators (originally Minnie &quot;Renwood&quot; Bemis). Fuller&#x27;s innovative choreography led to legal challenges as she sought to protect her work. In 1892, she filed a lawsuit against imitator Minnie Renwood Bemis in an attempt to secure intellectual property rights for her Serpentine Dance. The case, Fuller v. Bemis, became a landmark in dance copyright law. Despite Fuller&#x27;s precaution of submitting a written description of her dance to the U.S. Copyright Office, the U.S. Circuit Court denied her request for an injunction. The court ruled that the Serpentine Dance told no story and was therefore not eligible for copyright protection as a dramatic composition, which was the only category under which dance could potentially be protected at the time. The judge stated: &quot;A stage dance illustrating the poetry of motion by a series of graceful movements, combined with an attractive arrangement of drapery, lights and shadows, but telling no story, portraying no character and depicting no emotion, is not a &#x27;dramatic composition&#x27; within the meaning of the Copyright Act.&quot; The precedent set by Fuller&#x27;s case remained in place until the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976, which explicitly extended protection to nondramatic choreographic works. Another notorious imitator was Lord Yarmouth, later 7th Marquess of Hertford, who performed the &quot;Serpentine Dance&quot; under the stage name of ‘Mademoiselle Roze’. Fuller&#x27;s pursuit of copyright protection was part of a broader struggle for artistic recognition and control over her work in a male-dominated theatrical industry. As a performer selling her live enactment of the Serpentine Dance in the theatrical marketplace, Fuller&#x27;s body circulated in commodity form. Her attempts to protect her performing body from becoming fully open to capital by asserting property rights over her image and choreography marked a complex negotiation between her status as artist and commodity.

In the hope of receiving serious artistic recognition that she was not getting in America, Fuller left for Europe in June 1892. She became one of the first of many American modern dancers who traveled to Europe to seek recognition. Her warm reception in Paris persuaded Fuller to remain in France, where she became one of the leading revolutionaries in the arts.

A regular performer at the Folies Bergère with works such as &quot;Fire Dance&quot;, Fuller became the embodiment of the Art Nouveau movement and was often identified with symbolism, as her work was seen as the perfect reciprocity between idea and symbol. Fuller began adapting and expanding her costume and lighting, so that they became the principal element in her performance—perhaps even more important than the actual choreography, especially as the length of the skirt was increased and became the central focus, while the body became mostly hidden within the depths of the fabric. The choreography of the &quot;Serpentine Dance&quot; was filmed by multiple early filmmakers, including Auguste and Louis Lumière, but it is unclear whether the recordings depict Fuller herself.

Gab Sorère and Fuller would make three films together, &quot;Le Lys de la vie&quot; (The Lily of Life, 1921), &quot;Visions des rêves&quot; (Visions of dreams, 1924) and &quot;Les Incertitudes de Coppélius&quot; (Uncertainties of Coppelius, 1927). &quot;Le Lys de la vie&quot; was a silent film, based upon a story written by Queen Marie of Romania, a close friend of the couple and is the only one of the films which survived.

&quot;The only surviving reel of her work is a segment from Le Lys de la Vie, and features a show within a show with classically-costumed figures dancing by the sea, a banquet, royal intrigue, and romance with René Clair featured as a prince on horseback.&quot;

According to Celia McGerr&#x27;s biography of René Clair, in 1920, singer Damia &quot;persuaded a reluctant Clair to play the role of a suave Parisian in Loie Fuller&#x27;s poetic film on dance&quot;Le lys de la vie&quot;, by telling him about the pretty girls who would be present.&quot;

Fuller&#x27;s pioneering work attracted the attention, respect, and friendship of many French artists and scientists, including Jules Chéret, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, François-Raoul Larche, Henri-Pierre Roché, Auguste Rodin, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Franz von Stuck, Maurice Denis, Thomas Theodor Heine, Paul-Léon Jazet, Koloman Moser, Demétre Chiparus, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Marie Curie. Fuller was also a member of the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society).

Fuller patented many of her innovations in stage lighting, including the use of chemical compounds for creating color gel, and the application of chemical salts to luminescent lighting and garments.

Fuller supported other pioneering performers, such as Sada Yacco and fellow United States-born dancer Isadora Duncan. Fuller helped Duncan ignite her European career in 1902 by sponsoring independent concerts in Vienna and Budapest.

Fuller&#x27;s work attracted the attention and respect of many French artists and scientists. She was also a member of the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society).

Loie Fuller&#x27;s original stage name was &quot;Louie&quot;. In modern French &quot;L&#x27;ouïe&quot; is the word for a sense of hearing. When Fuller reached Paris she gained a nickname which was a pun on &quot;Louie&quot;/&quot;L&#x27;ouïe&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Loïe&quot; – this nickname is a corruption of the early or Medieval French &quot;L&#x27;oïe&quot;, a precursor to &quot;L&#x27;ouïe&quot;, which means &quot;receptiveness&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot;. She was also referred to by the nickname &quot;Lo Lo Fuller&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Fuller met her romantic partner of over 30 years, Gab Sorère, in the mid-1890s. Sorère was born Gabrielle Bloch, the daughter of wealthy French bankers, in 1870, and eventually took the name Gab Sorère in 1920. Bloch first saw Fuller perform at the age of 14, and by 1898 Fuller and Bloch were living together.

Fuller and Bloch&#x27;s relationship initially attracted some attention in the press, as Bloch dressed exclusively in menswear, and was 8 years Fuller&#x27;s junior. The press coverage of their relationship declined over time, focusing more on Fuller&#x27;s mother, and allowing Bloch and Fuller to live a relatively unbothered life.

Fuller met Crown Princess Marie of Romania, later to become Queen Marie, in 1902, at a performance in Bucharest. Marie and Fuller became close, and maintained an extensive correspondence as close friends. Their relationship was the subject of scandalous rumors, alleging that Fuller and Queen Marie were lovers. Fuller, through a connection at the United States embassy in Paris, played a role in arranging a United States loan for Romania during World War I.

Later, during the period when the future Carol II of Romania was alienated from the Romanian royal family and living in Paris with his mistress Magda Lupescu, she befriended them; they were unaware of her connection to Carol&#x27;s mother Marie. Fuller initially advocated to Marie on behalf of the couple, but later schemed unsuccessfully with Marie to separate Carol from Lupescu. With Queen Marie and American businessman Samuel Hill, Fuller helped found the Maryhill Museum of Art in rural Washington state, which has permanent exhibits about her career.

== Later life and death ==
Fuller occasionally returned to America to stage performances by her students, the &quot;Fullerets&quot; or Muses, but spent the end of her life in Paris. She died of pneumonia at the age of 65 on January 1, 1928, in Paris, two weeks shy of her 66th birthday. She was cremated and buried in the columbarium of the Père-Lachaise cemetery (site No. 5382) in Paris.

==Legacy==

After Fuller&#x27;s death, her romantic partner of thirty years, Gab Sorère inherited the dance troupe as well as the laboratory Fuller had operated. Sorère took legal action against dancers who wrongfully used Fuller&#x27;s fame to enhance their own careers and produced both films and theatrical productions to honor Fuller&#x27;s legacy as a visual effects artist.

Fuller&#x27;s work has been experiencing a resurgence of professional and public interest. Rhonda K. Garelick&#x27;s 2009 study entitled &quot;Electric Salome&quot; demonstrates her centrality not only to dance, but also modernist performance. Sally R. Sommer has written extensively about Fuller&#x27;s life and times Marcia and Richard Current published a biography entitled &quot;Loie Fuller, Goddess of Light&quot; in 1997. The philosopher Jacques Rancière devoted a chapter of &quot;Aisthesis&quot;, his history of modern aesthetics, to Fuller&#x27;s 1893 performances in Paris, which he considers emblematic of Art Nouveau in their attempt to link artistic and technological invention. Giovanni Lista compiled a 680-page book of Fuller-inspired art work and texts in &quot;Loïe Fuller, Danseuse de la Belle Epoque&quot; in 1994. In the 1980s, Munich dancer Brygida Ochaim revived Fuller&#x27;s dances and techniques, also appearing in the Claude Chabrol film The Swindler.

In 2016, Stéphanie Di Giusto directed the movie &quot;The Dancer&quot; about the life of Loïe Fuller, with actresses Soko as Loïe and Lily-Rose Depp as Isadora Duncan. Jody Sperling choreographed Soko&#x27;s dances for the movie, served as creative consultant and was Soko&#x27;s dance coach, training her in Fuller technique, which earned Sperling a World Choreography Award nomination. The movie premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. 

Commissioned by the Paul Taylor Dance Company for their November 2024 Lincoln Center Season, Sperling developed &quot;Vive La Loïe&quot;, an expansion upon material created for &quot;La Danseuse (The Dancer)&quot; with the Loïe character performing atop a box containing lights within. The work for the Taylor company mines Fuller’s synaesthetic concept of “color harmony” in which multi-hued lights are composed like musical notes into luminous “melodies” and “chords.” Sperling collaborated closely with Bessie Award-winning lighting designer David Ferri so that each dance moment unfolds as a synthesis of motion, emotion, fabric, and light. 

Fuller continues to be an influence on contemporary choreographers. Sperling has choreographed dozens of works inspired by Fuller and expanded Fuller&#x27;s vocabulary and technique into the 21st century. Sperling&#x27;s company, &quot;Time Lapse Dance&quot;, consists of six female-identifying dancers who are all versed in Fuller-style technique and performance. The company reimagines the art of Fuller in the context of contemporary and environmental forms. 

Another is Ann Cooper Albright, who collaborated with a lighting designer on a series of works that drew inspiration from Fuller&#x27;s original lighting design patents. Shela Xoregos choreographed a tribute, &quot;La Loȉe&quot;, a solo which shows several of Fuller&#x27;s special effects.

Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2018 Reputation Tour featured a segment dedicated to Fuller. During her performance of &quot;Dress&quot; each night on the tour, several dancers recreated the &quot;Serpentine Dance.&quot; In the Reputation Stadium Tour concert film on Netflix, after &quot;Dress&quot; there is a message showing Taylor&#x27;s dedication to Fuller.

Into the 2019 film &quot;Radioactive&quot; Loie Fuller (Drew Jacoby) is a friend of the main character Marie Curie.
The scientist envisions Fuller dancing in the green light of radium. The dancer also introduces the Curies to a medium.

==Written works==
Fuller&#x27;s autobiographical memoir &quot;Quinze ans de ma vie&quot; was written in English, translated into French by Bojidar Karageorgevitch and published by F. Juven (Paris) in 1908 with an introduction by Anatole France. She drafted her memoirs again in English a few years later, which were published under the title &quot;Fifteen Years of a Dancer&#x27;s Life&quot; by H. Jenkins (London) in 1913. The New York Public Library Jerome Robbins Dance Collection holds the nearly complete manuscript to the English edition and materials related to the French edition.

Fuller&#x27;s autobiography is a first hand account, and she was known for being very adaptive in her story telling. There are seven highly dramatized versions of how she got her first silk skirt; however, the real story is unknown. As well as writing about inventing the &quot;Serpentine Dance&quot;, she also wrote extensively about her own theories of modern dance and motion.

<doc id="697050" wikidata="Q268760" url="?curid=697050" title="Ruth St. Denis">
<text>Ruth St. Denis (born Ruth Dennis; January 20, 1879 – July 21, 1968) was an American pioneer of modern dance, introducing eastern ideas into the art and paving the way for other women in dance. She was inspired by the Delsarte advocate Genevieve Stebbins. St. Denis was the co-founder in 1915 of the American Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts. She taught notable performers including Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey. In 1938, she founded the pioneering dance program at Adelphi University. She published several articles on spiritual dance and the mysticism of the body. 

Her signature solos continue to be performed. She was inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame in 1987.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Ruth Dennis was born in Newark, New Jersey on January 20, 1879. Her parents were Ruth Emma Hull (a physician by training), and Thomas Laban Dennis, a machinist and inventor; they were not married. She was raised on the small Pin Oaks Farm in New Jersey, where she studied Christian Science. She used to invent melodramas, specialising in fainting and collapsing to the floor in front of an audience of friends. As a child, she learned exercises based on François Delsarte&#x27;s Society Gymnastics and Voice Culture. This was the beginning of St. Denis&#x27;s dance training, and was instrumental in developing her technique later in life. In 1891 she raised the money to travel briefly to New York, auditioning in the Marwig studio; she was pronounced to have talent, and her mother set about getting her into theatre. In 1892, she witnessed the Delsarte advocate Genevieve Stebbins performing a matinee, &quot;The Dance of Day&quot;; she described the experience as &quot;the real birth of my art life&quot;.

=== Debut ===

In 1894, after years of practicing Delsarte poses, she debuted as a skirt dancer for Worth&#x27;s Family Theatre and Museum. From this modest start, she progressed to touring with an acclaimed producer and director, David Belasco; this gave her the opportunity to observe Belasco&#x27;s skill in creating a theatrical atmosphere with a &quot;perfect combination of subliminal suggestion and concrete detail&quot;. While touring in Belasco&#x27;s production of &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; in 1904 she had a career-changing moment. She was at a drugstore with another member of Belasco&#x27;s company in Buffalo, New York, when she saw a poster advertising Egyptian Deities brand cigarettes. The poster portrayed the Egyptian goddess Isis enthroned in a temple; this image captivated her on the spot and inspired her to create dances that expressed the mysticism that the goddess&#x27;s image conveyed. From then on, she was immersed in Oriental philosophies.
In 1905, she began her career as a solo artist, soon making her first European tour using the stage name of St. Denis. The first piece that resulted from her interest in the Orient was &quot;Radha&quot; performed in 1906. Drawing from Hindu mythology, Radha is the story of Krishna and his love for a mortal milkmaid. &quot;Radha&quot; was originally performed to music from Léo Delibes&#x27; opera &quot;Lakmé&quot;. This piece was a celebration of the five senses and appealed to a contemporary fascination with the Orient. 
In 1909, St. Denis performed a Salome dance at Broadway&#x27;s Hudson Theatre. This was during the height of the &quot;Salomania&quot; craze in the U.S., and one reviewer declared she was “out-Salomeing all the Salomes&quot; and that &quot;Miss St. Denis burst upon dazzled audiences.”
Although her choreography was not culturally accurate or authentic, it was expressive of the themes that St. Denis perceived in Oriental culture and highly entertaining to contemporary audiences. St. Denis believed dance to be a spiritual expression, and her choreography reflected this idea.

=== Denishawn ===

In 1911, a young dancer named Ted Shawn was impressed by seeing St. Denis perform in Denver. In 1914, Shawn applied to be her student, and soon became her artistic partner and husband. Together they founded Denishawn, the &quot;cradle of American modern dance.&quot; One of her more famous pupils was Martha Graham. Together St. Denis and Shawn founded the Los Angeles Denishawn school in 1915. Students studied ballet movements without shoes, ethnic and folk dances, Dalcroze Eurhythmics, and Delsarte gymnastics. In 1916 they created a collection of dances inspired by Egypt, which included &quot;Tillers of the Soil&quot;, a duet between St. Denis and Shawn, as well as &quot;Pyrrhic Dance&quot;, an all-male dance piece. Her exploration of the Orient continued into 1923 when she staged &quot;Ishtar of the Seven Gates&quot; in which she portrayed a Babylonian goddess. Together St. Denis and Shawn toured throughout the 1910s and 1920s, often performing their works on the vaudeville stage.

Other notable dancers such as Doris Humphrey, Lillian Powell, Evan-Burrows Fontaine and Charles Weidman studied at Denishawn. Graham, Humphrey, Weidman and the future silent film star Louise Brooks all performed as dancers with the Denishawn company. At Denishawn, St. Denis served as inspiration to her young students, while Shawn taught the technique classes. St. Denis and Shawn were instrumental in creating the legendary dance festival Jacob&#x27;s Pillow.

=== Later career ===

Although Denishawn had crumbled by 1930, St. Denis continued to dance, teach and choreograph independently as well as in collaboration with other artists. St. Denis redirected her works from Orient-inspired to combining religion and dance through her Rhythmic Choir of Dancers. Kelly Mayo comments that through these works, St. Denis sought to embody the Virgin Mary in the same manner in which she once sought to embody goddesses. In 1938 St. Denis founded Adelphi University&#x27;s dance program, one of the first dance departments in an American university. It has since become a cornerstone of Adelphi&#x27;s Department of Performing Arts. She cofounded a second school in 1940, the School of Nataya, which focused on teaching Oriental dance. For many years, St. Denis taught dance at her studio, at 3433 Cahuenga Boulevard West, near Universal City, California.

== Death and legacy ==
St. Denis died in Los Angeles on July 21, 1968, aged 89. Her signature solos continue to be performed as in &quot;The Art of the Solo&quot; at the Baltimore Museum of Art in 2006, which began with St. Denis&#x27;s &quot;The Incense&quot;. George Jackson described this as &quot;waft[ing] into space as the image of a woman in motion amidst ascending spirals of smoke&quot;, conveying &quot;serenity, &#x27;spirituality&#x27; if you will, ... [not] at odds with sensuality.&quot;

St. Denis was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987, its first year.

The global organization Dances of Universal Peace were started by a student of St. Denis, Samuel L. Lewis. The Dances of Universal Peace organization subsequently published many of St. Denis&#x27;s writings on spiritual dance and the mysticism of the body.

<text>Michael Scott Speicher (July 12, 1957 – unknown) was a naval aviator in the United States Navy who was shot down over Iraq during the Persian Gulf War becoming the first American combat casualty of the war. His fate was not known until 2 August 2009 when the U.S. Navy reported that Speicher&#x27;s remains had been found in Iraq by the United States military. The official cause of death was &quot;homicide by undetermined means&quot; and DNA testing showed survival after his crash. He is also the most recent American to have been shot down in air-to-air combat.

==Early life and education==
Michael Scott Speicher was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on 12 July 1957. Scott and his sister went to Lakewood Elementary School and Eastgate Middle School before attending Winnetonka High School.

When Speicher was 15, his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where he attended Nathan Bedford Forrest High School. After graduating from high school, he then attended Florida State University (FSU). Speicher graduated from FSU in 1980 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in accounting and business management. While at Florida State, he met Joanne, whom he eventually married, and they had two children. Eighteen months after Speicher went missing in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, friend and fellow U.S. Navy pilot Buddy Harris married Joanne. They had two children.

Speicher&#x27;s father had been a fighter pilot in World War II. Speicher went on his first airplane flight when he was five years old. Speicher was a cadet member of the Civil Air Patrol as a teenager. Upon graduation from FSU, Speicher joined the U.S. Navy and attended Aviation Officer Candidate School at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. After flight training at various bases, he was designated as a naval aviator and spent several years as both a fleet squadron aviator in the A-7 Corsair II and F/A-18 Hornet and as a flight instructor on the F/A-18.

By the early 1990s, Speicher had attained the rank of lieutenant commander and was stationed at NAS Cecil Field near Jacksonville, Florida. He was assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron Eighty One (VFA-81 &quot;Sunliners&quot;), deploying with Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW-17) aboard the aircraft carrier . At the time of his deployment to the Iraq theater, Speicher and his wife had a 3-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son.

==Loss incident==

Speicher was flying an F/A-18 Hornet fighter, BuNo 163484, when he was shot down by Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) aircraft 100 miles west of Baghdad, in the early hours of 17 January 1991, the first night of Operation Desert Storm. His plane crashed in a remote, uninhabited wasteland known as Tulul ad Dulaym at . He was the first combat casualty for American forces in the war.

The U.S. Navy maintained in a 1997 document that Speicher was downed by a surface-to-air missile. However, an unclassified summary of a 2001 CIA report suggests that Speicher&#x27;s aircraft was shot down by a missile fired from an Iraqi aircraft, most likely a MiG-25, flown by Lieutenant Zuhair Dawoud, 84th squadron of the IQAF. Speicher was at 28,000 feet and travelling at 0.92 Mach (540 knots) when the front of the aircraft suffered a catastrophic event. The impact from the R-40 missile threw the aircraft laterally off its flight path between fifty and sixty degrees with a resulting 6 g minimum load. A pilot on the same mission stated: &quot;I&#x27;m telling you right now, don&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re being told. It was that MiG that shot Spike down.&quot;

==Status and investigations==

===1990s===
The day after the shoot-down, Speicher was placed on MIA status. On 22 May 1991, after the end of the Gulf War, Speicher&#x27;s status was changed to killed in action, body not recovered (KIA/BNR). Navy Commander Buddy Harris, who was a friend and fellow naval aviator of Speicher&#x27;s, became a strong advocate for searching for Speicher, often meeting with U.S. officials.

In December 1993, a military official from Qatar discovered the wreckage of a plane in the desert, which was subsequently identified as Speicher&#x27;s aircraft. The canopy was a good distance from the rest of the aircraft, suggesting Speicher had tried to eject. In April 1994, a U.S. satellite photographed apparent human-made symbols on the desert floor near the wreck&#x27;s location, which might possibly be Speicher&#x27;s E &amp; E (Escape and Evade) sign, suggesting that Speicher might have survived the crash. A covert American operation to inspect the site was considered, but rejected by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, as too risky.

In December 1995, working through the International Committee of the Red Cross, investigators from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army&#x27;s Central Identification Laboratory went to Iraq and conducted an excavation of the crash site. Bedouin nomads gave investigators a flight uniform that was likely Speicher&#x27;s, with his name supposedly cut out of it, but the investigators concluded it had been planted there. Other evidence led investigators to further conclude Speicher had likely ejected, and was not in the plane at the time it crashed. In September 1996, the Secretary of the Navy in a new review reaffirmed the presumptive finding of death.

In 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense document leaked to &quot;The New York Times&quot; showed that the Pentagon had not been forthcoming with information previously requested by U.S. Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota. Senator Grams publicly accused the Pentagon of misleading him, and joined with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire in calling for an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Speicher case was taken up by the National Alliance of Families, which had been quite active in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. Speculative theories were developed as to the circumstances of Speicher&#x27;s shoot-down, and assuming he was still alive, why the U.S. military might not want to find him and why Iraq might not want to return him.

===2000s===
In January 2001, the Secretary of the Navy changed Speicher&#x27;s status to &quot;missing in action&quot;. This was the first time the Defense Department had ever made such a change. In conjunction with the change in classification, Speicher was promoted to commander, in accordance with U.S. Navy practice for POWs held a long time. The 2001 CIA report stated that he may have survived by ejecting. Rumors from Iraq said that Speicher was captive, walked with a limp, and had facial scars. In July 2002, Speicher was further promoted to Captain.

Speicher&#x27;s possible situation became a more high-profile issue in the build-up to war. In March 2002, the &quot;Washington Times&quot; ran five successive front-page articles about it, National Review Online ran a long piece on it, and on 12 September 2002, President George W. Bush mentioned Speicher in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly as part of his case for war against Iraq. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida also took a strong interest in the case. Speicher&#x27;s status was changed again to &quot;missing/captured&quot; on 11 October 2002, one day after the United States Congress authorized the use of military force in Iraq. Then-U.S. Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England said, &quot;While the information available to me now does not prove definitively that Commander Speicher is alive and in Iraqi custody, I am personally convinced the Iraqis seized him sometime after his plane went down. Further, it is my firm belief that the government of Iraq knows what happened to Cmdr. Speicher.&quot;

Upon the 2003 invasion of Iraq in March 2003, a major investigation on the ground began, that also further increased public attention to the matter. In April 2003, Speicher&#x27;s possible initials were discovered in a cell at Hakmiyah prison in Baghdad. Investigators did not think it was significant because a similar carving of &quot;MJN&quot; was found directly above the &quot;MSS&quot; scrawl. Subsequent tests on hair found in the cell&#x27;s drain did not match Speicher&#x27;s DNA. Senator Nelson went to Iraq to visit the prison personally. Speicher&#x27;s name was also found on a document in Iraq, dated January 2003, that had the names of prisoners being held in the country. Officials stated that the 90-page document offered no evidence of whether Speicher was alive and might have been written either to provide an accounting of former Iraqi POWs or to confuse the U.S. military.

Over time, as the U.S. occupation increasingly gained control over Anbar Province, the Pentagon said that Speicher probably was not captured.

On 5 January 2009, the U.S. Navy held a review board to consider officially closing the case. The review board recommended that the Pentagon continue investigating what happened to Speicher. The recommendation went to Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter who had the final decision. Speicher&#x27;s family believed and was worried that would change the status of Captain Speicher to KIA and declared they would oppose such action.

On 10 March 2009, the Secretary of the Navy declared that Captain Speicher&#x27;s status was changed from &quot;Missing/Captured&quot; back to &quot;Missing-in-Action.&quot;

===Discovery and positive identification===
On 2 August 2009, the Navy reported that Speicher&#x27;s remains were found in Iraq by United States Marines from 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. His jawbone was used to identify him after study at the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs at Dover Air Force Base. According to local civilians, Speicher was buried by Bedouins after his plane was shot down. Senator Nelson attributed the delayed finding to the culture of the locality: &quot;These Bedouins roam around in the desert, they don&#x27;t stay in one place, and it just took this time to find the specific site.&quot;

Speicher&#x27;s family expressed gratitude that the Defense Department had stayed with the case and that closure was now available. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; termed the case &quot;a veritable saga punctuated with hope, uncertainty, and despair for the past 18 years.&quot;

==Legacy==

Florida State University named its tennis center after Speicher, an avid player. The $1.2 million Scott Speicher Tennis Complex was completed in 2003. In 2018, FSU President John Thrasher joined members of Speicher’s family to unveil a new memorial honoring Speicher. The memorial, located at the entrance of the tennis facility named after him in 1993, features a bronze Navy pilot’s helmet and oxygen mask and will eventually include a bronze Navy G-1 flight jacket and naval officer&#x27;s khaki garrison cap similar to what Speicher would have worn.

A memorial statue and plaque were erected on Naval Air Station Cecil Field and dedicated to him. The Naval Air Station has since been deactivated but the facility remains in operation as a joint civil–military airport.

A memorial head marker dedicated to Speicher stood in Section H of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia as of 2002. The memorial markers are erected when there are no identifiable remains for an individual whose death has been substantiated. Cemetery policy states that if remains are later recovered, the head marker will be interred with the coffin.

In effort to honor Speicher, a former Iraqi air base in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit was renamed COB Speicher.

A U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet on display outside the Naval Aviation Schools Command at NAS Pensacola, Florida, was dedicated to the Speicher family in May 2009. The aircraft was painted in the markings of United States Navy squadron VFA-81 &quot;Sunliners&quot; and , which was Speicher&#x27;s squadron and ship when he was shot down. A front-page story in the 7 August 2009 issue of the Naval Air Station Pensacola newspaper &quot;Gosport&quot; describes how Speicher&#x27;s remains were discovered and identified after 18 years. The story has a photo of Speicher&#x27;s children talking with a member of VFA-81 next to the plane.

On 13 August 2009, the remains of Captain Speicher arrived in Florida 18 years after having been shot down in the Persian Gulf War. The plane containing his remains touched down at Naval Air Station Jacksonville at 3 p.m. Thousands of friends and family gathered for his burial. Captain Speicher&#x27;s final resting place is at the Jacksonville Memory Garden located in Orange Park, Florida.

On 7 September 2009, Captain Speicher was honored at the start of the Florida State University football game against the University of Miami at Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium when a flight of F/A-18s performed the missing man formation.

On Memorial Day 2010, an American flag and a wooden cross bearing his name were commissioned, adding him to the Clay County Florida Parade of Flags.

===Family===
Speicher was married to JoAnne and they had two children (Meghan and Michael).

In the early months and years after Speicher&#x27;s incident over Iraq, JoAnne Speicher was supported by Speicher&#x27;s friend, &quot;Buddy&quot; Harris. Eventually, the two became a couple and married. Harris took her two children as his own, then they had two children (Madison and Makenzie) of their own. Harris was a significant voice for action to settle the details of Speicher&#x27;s death, and has been an ongoing voice for POWs and MIAs.

<text>Alexander Island, which is also known as Alexander I Island, Alexander I Land, Alexander Land, Alexander I Archipelago, and Zemlja Alexandra I, is the largest island of Antarctica. It lies in the Bellingshausen Sea west of Palmer Land, Antarctic Peninsula from which it is separated by Marguerite Bay and George VI Sound. The George VI Ice Shelf entirely fills George VI Sound and connects Alexander Island to Palmer Land. The island partly surrounds Wilkins Sound, which lies to its west. Alexander Island is about long in a north–south direction, wide in the north, and wide in the south. Alexander Island is the second-largest uninhabited island in the world, after Devon Island.

==History==
Alexander Island was discovered on January 28, 1821, by a Russian expedition under Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, who named it Alexander I Land for the reigning Tsar Alexander I of Russia.

What, in fact, is an island, was believed to be part of the Antarctic mainland until 1940. Its insular nature was proven in December 1940, by a two-person sledge party composed of Finn Ronne and Carl Eklund of the United States Antarctic Service. In the 1950s, a British base administered as part of the British Antarctic Territory was constructed as Fossil Bluff (&quot;Base KG&quot;).

The island was claimed by the United Kingdom in 1908 as part of the British Antarctic Territory. Territorial claims have also been set by both Chile (in 1940) and Argentina (in 1942). Currently, under the Antarctic Treaty no claim has been officially recognized. The island contains the British Fossil Bluff meteorological centre and refuelling base.

==Geography==
The surface of Alexander Island is predominantly ice-covered. There exist some exposed nunataks and a few ice-free areas of significant size, including Ablation Point Massif. The nunataks are the peaks of north–south trending mountain ranges and hills. They include the Colbert, Havre, Lassus, Rouen, Sofia University, and Walton Mountains, the Staccato Peaks, the Lully Foothills, the Finlandia Foothills, the Elgar Uplands, and the Douglas Range. These mountains, peaks, hills, and uplands are surrounded by a permanent ice sheet, which consists of glaciers that flow off of Alexander Island. These glaciers flow west into the Bach and Wilkins Ice Shelves and Bellingshausen Sea, and east into the George VI Ice Shelf. The George VI Ice Shelf is fed by both by outlet glaciers from the ice cap on Palmer Land and Alexander Island.

Another notable feature of Alexander Island is Hodgson Lake, a former subglacial lake that has emerged from under an ice sheet that had covered it. Hodgson Lake is long by , and has a deep water column that lies sealed beneath a thick perennial lake ice.

The northern side of Hodgson Lake is bounded by the Saturn Glacier, which flows east into George VI Sound, while the southern side of Hodgson Lake is bounded by the northern face of Citadel Bastion. During the Last Glacial Maximum, Hodgson Lake was covered by the ice sheet at least thick.

This ice sheet started thinning about 13,500 years ago. It retreated and left Hodgson Lake covered by perennial ice sometime before 11,000 years ago. This lake has been covered by perennial ice since that time.

Other features on the island include Damocles Point and Mount Tyrrell.

===Brahms Inlet===
Brahms Inlet () is an ice-filled inlet, long and wide, indenting the north side of Beethoven Peninsula on Alexander Island between Harris Peninsula and Derocher Peninsula, while the headland Mazza Point lies immediately northeast of the inlet and Mount Grieg lies immediately southeast of the base of Brahms Inlet. It was observed from the air and first mapped by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947–48, and re-mapped from the RARE air photos by Derek J.H. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Johannes Brahms, the German composer.

===Harris Peninsula===
Harris Peninsula () is a broad snow-covered peninsula surmounted by Mount Lee, between Verdi Inlet and Brahms Inlet on the north side of the Beethoven Peninsula, located in the southwest portion of Alexander Island, Antarctica. It is one of eight peninsulas of Alexander Island. It was photographed from the air by the RARE, 1947–48, and mapped from these photographs by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, 1960. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Commander Michael J. Harris, U.S. Navy, Commanding Officer of Squadron VXE-6, from May 1982 to May 1983.

===Lyadov Glacier===
Lyadov Glacier () is a glacier flowing east-northeast from Harris Peninsula, Alexander Island, into Brahms Inlet. It was named by the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1987 after Anatoly Lyadov (1855–1914), a Russian composer.

==Geology==
According to Hole, &quot;The geology of Alexander Island can be attributed mainly to processes associated with the subduction of proto-Pacific oceanic crust along the western margin of the Antarctic Peninsula, from latest Triassic to Late Tertiary times.&quot; The LeMay Group accretionary prism complex, along with plutonic and volcanic rocks, are prevalent along the western portion of the island. The LeMay Group consists of variably-deformed and metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Although it is dominated by deformed arkosic sedimentary rocks, it includes turbiditic greywackes, black mudstones, and conglomerates. The thick Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Fossil Bluff Group sedimentary rocks outcrop as a long by wide belt along the eastern coast. This Fossil Bluff Group consists of a basal deep-marine assemblage thick, overlain by a mudstone assemblage up to thick, followed by a shallow-marine assemblage of coarsening upward sandstones. Alkali basalts erupted after the cessation of subduction. These range in age from the tephrites at Mount Pinafore (5.5–7.6 Ma), to the basanites at Rothschild Island (5.5 Ma) and Hornpipe Heights (2.5 Ma), to the alkali and olivine basalts on Beethoven Peninsula (&lt;1-2.5 Ma).

The LeMay Range Fault trends N-S, parallel to the George VI Sound, and the Fossil Bluff Formation is downfaulted to the east of this fault against the LeMay Group. Sand dykes are found against this fault zone and in many other parts of the Fossil Bay Formation. Fossils within the Fossil Bluff Formation include ammonites, belemnites, bivalves, and serpulids.

<text>Dwayne Kenneth Schintzius (October 14, 1968 – April 15, 2012) was an American National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball player. He was born in Brandon, Florida and attended the University of Florida, where he helped lead the Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball program to its first three NCAA tournament appearances as an all-conference center. Schintzius was selected in the first round of the 1990 NBA draft (24th overall) by the San Antonio Spurs, but chronic back problems reduced his effectiveness, and he played for six different NBA teams over ten seasons in the league, mainly as a reserve player.

Off the court, Schintzius was known for his distinctive mullet-style haircut that he called &quot;the lobster&quot;, his sometimes abrasive behavior, and his performance as a Russian basketball player in the 1996 comedy film &quot;Eddie&quot;. In 2009, he was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. After treatment and a brief remission, he died from complications of the disease in 2012.

==Early years==
Schintzius was born in Brandon, Florida, a suburb of Tampa. He attended Brandon High School, and played as a center for the Brandon Eagles high school basketball team. Together with teammate Toney Mack, Schintzius led the Eagles to a Class 4A state runner-up finish as a sophomore, and another Final Four berth as a junior. As a senior, he averaged 21.1 points and 17 rebounds per game, was a finalist for Florida&#x27;s Mr. Basketball award, and was recognized as a high school All-American by McDonald&#x27;s and &quot;Parade&quot; magazine in 1986.

==College career==
Schintzius received athletic scholarship offers from many top college programs. Unlike most top Florida high school basketball prospects up to that point, he chose to stay in-state and attend the University of Florida, where he played for the Florida Gators men&#x27;s basketball team from 1987 to 1990 under head coach Norm Sloan. Schintzius started at center for the Gators beginning early in his freshman season. By the end of his junior season (1988–89), he had led the Gators in scoring, rebounding, and free-throw percentage over at least one full season. He also set the program&#x27;s record for blocked shots, and at the end of his junior year, his season blocked shot totals ranked first, second, and third in school history.

The Gators had never been invited to the NCAA basketball tournament in over seven decades of basketball. However, they made the field during each of Schintztius&#x27;s three full seasons with the program and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in 1987. During his junior year, the Gators won their first-ever regular season Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship. Schintzius was recognized as a first-team All-SEC player after that season and was included on multiple All-American lists.

However, Schintzius&#x27; college career was marred by disciplinary problems. He occasionally clashed with Coach Sloan, including one instance in which he refused to re-enter a game with a minute left during his sophomore season. He also had minor incidents with opposing players, fans, and mascots, and with others off the court.

During his junior season, Schintzius allegedly heard a rude remark from a sidewalk while riding in a car outside a Gainesville nightclub and stormed after the offender wielding a tennis racket. Schintzius later apologized and was not charged with a crime, but the university&#x27;s office of student affairs found him guilty of violating the student code of conduct and suspended him for four games.

After returning from that suspension, fans in opposing arenas occasionally threw tennis balls onto the court, presumably taunting Schintzius for the incident. In January 1989, Florida traveled to Nashville to face the Vanderbilt Commodores in a crucial SEC matchup. Losing 72–70, Florida turned the ball over with only one second left on the clock, seemingly sealing a loss. But at that point, someone in the Memorial Gymnasium home crowd threw a tennis ball onto the court. Referee John Clougherty immediately called a technical foul on the Commodores, and Schintzius, who led the Gators in free throw percentage that season, hit both free throws to send the game into overtime. He then scored the Gators&#x27; first seven points in the extra period and Florida won the game 81–78. Florida went on to capture the program&#x27;s first SEC regular season championship, beating Vanderbilt by a single game.

Sloan was forced to resign before Schintzius&#x27;s senior season of 1989–90 and was replaced on an interim basis by former Tennessee coach Don DeVoe. Schintzius was not happy with this turn of events and skipped DeVoe&#x27;s first practice with the team along with fellow star Livingston Chatman. Soon after, he was suspended for alleged involvement in a fraternity house fight. DeVoe told Schintzius that in order to rejoin the basketball team, he would have to improve his off-court behavior, maintain his playing weight (he weighed almost 300 pounds at one point), go to class consistently, and get rid of his distinct mullet-style haircut, known as the &quot;lobster.&quot;. In a statement released January 25, 1990, Schintzius claimed that he had done all these things, but was nonetheless quitting the team due to conflicts with his new coach. The statement read, in part:
No one can argue that Coach Sloan and Coach Towe (Monte Towe, Sloan&#x27;s assistant) were easy to play for, and to them you had to accept the coach as the absolute authority and their word as final; but that does not mean I must sail under the authority of Captain Ahab. If you can play for Coach Sloan, you can play for almost anyone, &quot;almost&quot; anyone.
Without Schintzius, the Gators lost sixteen of the seventeen games to end the season and missed the NCAA tournament for the first time since the year before his arrival.

Schintzius remains the only player in SEC history to amass more than 1,000 points, 800 rebounds, 250 assists and 250 blocks. He still holds Florida&#x27;s career record for blocked shots (272), and is ranks sixth among the program&#x27;s all-time scoring leaders with 1,624 points.

==Professional career==
Despite his personal issues, Schintzius was regarded as a good NBA prospect due to his performance on the court. Schintzius was widely projected as a top five pick before his suspension and during the suspension was seen as a lottery pick being mocked as high as 3rd overall to the late lottery with some seeing Schintzius as the most talented big-man in the draft . The San Antonio Spurs selected him in the first round (twenty-fourth pick overall) of the 1990 NBA draft. He injured his back during his rookie season and was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Antoine Carr on September 23, 1991. He later revealed that Spurs general manager Bob Bass disliked his mullet haircut and told him to cut it, which he did. Schintzius then sent Bass the shavings in an envelope. The Kings waived Schintzius during the 1991–92 season, and the New Jersey Nets signed him on October 1, 1992.

Schintzius&#x27; NBA career was severely hampered by injuries, particularly chronic back problems. He had several surgeries for a spinal disc herniation and often missed long stretches of playing time as he moved from team to team, mostly serving as a reserve center. He spent three seasons with the New Jersey Nets, a year with the Indiana Pacers, and then a year with the Los Angeles Clippers. Schintzius only played 15 games with the Clippers but did post 15 points in a loss against the Bullets on January 10, 1997. This game also featured the only three point make of Schintzius&#x27; NBA career. After missing the entire 1997–98 season due to injury, he played 16 games with the Boston Celtics in 1998–99 before retiring from the NBA. In eight NBA seasons, he appeared in 217 regular season games and started 33 of them.

He later came out of retirement to play in the minor leagues, and appeared in 35 games for the Mobile Revelers of the NBA&#x27;s Development League in 2001–02. He last played for the Brevard Blue Ducks of the United States Basketball League (USBL) in 2003.

==Off the court==
Schintzius played Ivan Radovadovitch, a fictional Georgian player for the New York Knicks, in the 1996 comedy movie &quot;Eddie&quot;, which starred Whoopi Goldberg as the team&#x27;s female coach. Several other actual NBA players were also featured as members of the Knicks and other real NBA teams in the film. He later appeared in local commercials.

At the trial of his former New Jersey Nets teammate Jayson Williams, he testified that he witnessed Williams kill his own dog with a shotgun.

==Illness and death==
In November 2009, Schintzius was diagnosed with a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a rare and often fatal form of the disease. With a bone marrow donation from his brother Travis, he underwent bone marrow transplantation at the Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa on January 12, 2010. The procedure was considered a success, but Schintzius struggled through several difficult rounds of chemotherapy until being declared cancer-free in July 2010.

In early 2012, Schintzius continued to suffer from complications, and a second bone marrow transplant was required. On April 15, 2012, Schintzius died at the Moffit Cancer Center from respiratory failure; he was 43 years old.

<text>Ted Shawn (born Edwin Myers Shawn; October 21, 1891 – January 9, 1972) was an American dancer and choreographer. Considered a pioneer of American modern dance, he created the Denishawn School together with his wife Ruth St. Denis. After their separation he created the all-male company Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers. With his innovative ideas of masculine movement, he was one of the most influential choreographers and dancers of his day. He was also the founder and creator of Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts.

== Ted Shawn and the creation of Denishawn ==
Ted Shawn was born in Kansas City, Missouri on October 21, 1891. Originally intending to become a minister of religion, he attended the University of Denver where he caught diphtheria at the age of 19, causing him temporary paralysis from the waist down. It was during his physical therapy for the disease that Shawn was introduced to dance in 1910, studying with Hazel Wallack, a former dancer with the Metropolitan Opera. In 1912, Shawn relocated to Los Angeles where he became part of an exhibition ballroom dance troupe with Norma Gould as his partner.

After moving to New York in 1914, Shawn married Ruth St. Denis on August 13, two months after their meeting. St. Denis served not only as a partner but an extremely valuable creative outlet to Shawn. Both artists believed strongly in the potential for dance as an art form becoming integrated into everyday life. The combination of their mutual artistic vision and Shawn&#x27;s business knowledge led to the couple opening the first Denishawn School in Los Angeles, California in 1915, with the goal of melding dance with body, mind and spirit.

Notable performances choreographed by him during Denishawn&#x27;s 17-year run include &quot;Invocation to the Thunderbird&quot;(1917), the solo &quot;Danse Americaine&quot;, performed by Charles Weidman (1923), &quot;Julnar of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Xochitl&quot; performed by Martha Graham (1920) and &quot;Les Mystères Dionysiaques&quot;. In addition to spawning the careers of Weidman and Graham, the Denishawn school also housed Louise Brooks and Doris Humphrey as students.

== Style and technique ==
Together, Shawn and Ruth St. Denis established an eclectic grouping of dance techniques including ballet (done without shoes) and movement that focused less on rigidity and more on the freeing of the upper body. To add to St. Denis&#x27;s mainly eastern influence, Shawn introduced elements of North African, Spanish, American and Amerindian dance, ushering in a new era of modern American dance. Breaking with European traditions, their choreography connected the physical and spiritual, often drawing from ancient, indigenous, and international sources.

== Ted Shawn and His Male Dancers ==

Due to Shawn&#x27;s marital problems and financial difficulties, Denishawn closed in the early 1930s. Subsequently, Shawn formed an all-male dance company of athletes he taught at Springfield College, with the mission to fight for acceptance of the American male dancer and to bring awareness of the art form from a male perspective.

The all-male company was based out of a farm that Shawn purchased near Lee, Massachusetts. On July 14, 1933, Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers had their premier performance at Shawn&#x27;s farm, which would later be known as Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival. Shawn produced some of his most innovate and controversial choreography to date with this company such as &quot;Ponca Indian Dance&quot;, &quot;Sinhalese Devil Dance&quot;, &quot;Maori War Haka&quot;, &quot;Hopi Indian Eagle Dance&quot;, &quot;Dyak Spear Dances&quot;, and &quot;Kinetic Molpai&quot;. Through these creative works Shawn showcased athletic and masculine movement that soon would gain popularity. The company performed in the United States and Canada, touring more than 750 cities, in addition to international success in London and Havana. Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers concluded at Jacob&#x27;s Pillow on August 31, 1940, with a homecoming performance.

Shawn had a romantic relationship with one of his dancers, Barton Mumaw, from 1931 to 1948. One of the leading stars of the company, Barton Mumaw would emerge onto the dance industry and be considered &quot;the American Nijinsky&quot;. While with Shawn, Mumaw began a relationship with John Christian, a stage manager for the company. Mumaw introduced Shawn to Christian. Later, Shawn formed a partnership with Christian, with whom he stayed from 1949 until his death in 1972.

===Jacob&#x27;s Pillow===
With this new company came the creation of Jacob&#x27;s Pillow: a dance school, retreat, and theater. The facilities also hosted teas, which, over time, became the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival. Shawn also created The School of Dance for Men around this time, which helped promote male dance in colleges nationwide.

Shawn taught classes at Jacob&#x27;s Pillow just months before his death at the age of 80. In 1965, Shawn was a Heritage Award recipient of the National Dance Association. Shawn&#x27;s final appearance on stage in the Ted Shawn Theater at Jacob&#x27;s Pillow was in &quot;Siddhas of the Upper Air&quot;, where he reunited with St. Denis for their fiftieth anniversary.

Saratoga Springs is now the home of the National Museum of Dance, the United States&#x27; only museum dedicated to professional dance. Shawn was inducted into the museum&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.

== Writings ==
Ted Shawn wrote and published nine books that provided a foundation for Modern Dance:
* 1920 – &quot;Ruth St. Denis: Pioneer and Prophet&quot;
* 1926 – &quot;The American Ballet&quot;
* 1929 – &quot;Gods Who Dance&quot;
* 1935 – &quot;Fundamentals of a Dance Education&quot;
* 1940 – &quot;Dance We Must&quot;
* 1944 – &quot;How Beautiful Upon the Mountain&quot;
* 1954 – &quot;Every Little Movement: a Book About Francois Delsarte&quot;
* 1959 – &quot;Thirty-three Years of American Dance&quot;
* 1960 – &quot;One Thousand and One Night Stands&quot; (autobiography, with Gray Poole)

== Legacy ==
In the 1940s, Shawn bestowed his works to the Museum of Modern Art. The museum subsequently deaccessed these works, giving them to New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and Jacob&#x27;s Pillow archive, while Shawn was still alive. Dancer Adam Weinert saw this as a violation of MoMA&#x27;s policy not to sell or give away works by living artists, and created &quot;The Reaccession of Ted Shawn&quot;, digital, augmented reality performances of Shawn&#x27;s works to be displayed in MoMA.

<text>SummerSlam is a professional wrestling event, produced annually since 1988 by the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion, WWE. Dubbed &quot;The Biggest Party of the Summer&quot;, it is considered WWE&#x27;s second biggest event of the year behind their flagship event, WrestleMania. It is also considered one of the company&#x27;s five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot;. The event has been broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV) since the inaugural 1988 event and via livestreaming since the 2014 event.

The inaugural SummerSlam took place on August 29, 1988, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The 1992 event was the company&#x27;s first major PPV to take place outside of North America with it being held at the original Wembley Stadium in London, England; it had a reported attendance of 80,355, which as of April 2023, WWE considers this to be their seventh largest live gate in history. From 2009 to 2014, SummerSlam was held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California and from 2015 to 2018, the event took place at the Barclays Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Beginning with the 2021 event, SummerSlam has been held in National Football League stadiums across the United States. From its inception up through that 2021 event, SummerSlam was held annually in August. The 2022 event marked the first and thus far only time that the event was not held in August, as it was instead held in July, with SummerSlam returning to August with the 2023 edition. The 2025 event will expand SummerSlam to two nights.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, that year&#x27;s SummerSlam was WWE&#x27;s first PPV and livestreaming event produced from their bio-secure bubble, the WWE ThunderDome. After the promotion resumed live touring with fans in July 2021, that year&#x27;s SummerSlam was promoted as the &quot;biggest event of 2021&quot; due to WrestleMania 37 having to be held at a reduced venue capacity. The 2021 SummerSlam in turn became the highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time until that record was broken with the 2023 event, which also became the highest-grossing non-WrestleMania event for WWE.

==History==

In the late 1980s, the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s (NWA) Jim Crockett Promotions. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon countered Jim Crockett&#x27;s successful Starrcade pay-per-view (PPV), which began airing in 1983, by creating WrestleMania in 1985. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created Survivor Series, which aired the same day as Starrcade in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988, on the same night as the Crockett produced PPV Bunkhouse Stampede. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created the Clash of the Champions I event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings, and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who rebranded it as World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

As the WWF continued to replace its closed circuit programming with pay-per-view programming, McMahon added more pay-per-views to the lineup to capitalize on the success of his previous events. In addition to WrestleMania in March/April, Survivor Series in November, and Royal Rumble in January, McMahon created an event for August, which he named SummerSlam. The inaugural SummerSlam was scheduled to be held on August 29, 1988, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. To keep the WWF from having a pay-per-view market monopoly, Turner began airing monthly WCW pay-per-views. As a result, both companies brought in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.

Dubbed &quot;The Biggest Party of the Summer&quot;, SummerSlam became one of the promotion&#x27;s most successful events, eventually considered the second biggest event of the year, behind WrestleMania, and also one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble, the promotion&#x27;s original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) following a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the &quot;WWE&quot; abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. Also in March 2002, the promotion introduced the brand extension, in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform—ECW became a third brand in 2006. The first brand extension was dissolved in August 2011, but it was reintroduced in July 2016. SummerSlam, along with the other original &quot;Big Four&quot; events, were the only PPVs to never be held exclusively for one brand during either brand split periods. In 2014, SummerSlam began to air on WWE&#x27;s online streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February that year, and in 2021, the event became available on Peacock as the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March that year.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming for Raw and SmackDown from a behind closed doors set at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida beginning mid-March. The 2020 SummerSlam was scheduled for August 23 at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, but it and the preceding night&#x27;s NXT TakeOver event had to be relocated due to the pandemic. On August 17, WWE announced that SummerSlam would emanate from Orlando&#x27;s Amway Center and it would be produced by way of a bio-secure bubble dubbed the WWE ThunderDome, which was first utilized for the August 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. This made SummerSlam the first major WWE event to be held outside of the Performance Center since March 2020, as well as their first pay-per-view produced from the ThunderDome. Inside the ThunderDome, drones, lasers, pyro, smoke, and projections were utilized to enhance wrestlers&#x27; entrances, and nearly 1,000 LED boards were installed to allow for rows and rows of virtual fans, who could register for a free virtual seat. Arena audio was also mixed with that of the virtual fans.

While SummerSlam has been considered WWE&#x27;s second biggest event of the year for many years, in 2021, it was promoted as the promotion&#x27;s biggest event of that year. WrestleMania 37 in April 2021, which was the promotion&#x27;s first event with live fans since before the pandemic, had to be held at a reduced venue capacity due to the ongoing pandemic. In July 2021, WWE resumed live touring with fans, and in an effort to sell out that year&#x27;s SummerSlam, which was held at the Allegiant Stadium in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada, WWE promoted SummerSlam as the &quot;biggest event of 2021&quot;. The 2021 event in turn became the highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time. Beginning with WrestleMania 36 in 2020, WWE began holding WrestleMania as a two-night event. Beginning with the 2025 event, SummerSlam will also expand to two nights, scheduled for the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford on August 2 and 3, 2025; the 2026 edition had originally been announced as the first-ever two-night SummerSlam before WWE later announced that the 2025 event would be two nights. Additionally, a future two-night SummerSlam will be held at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana as part of a partnership with the Indiana Sports Corp, which will see the 2025 Royal Rumble and a future WrestleMania held at the stadium.

From its inception in 1988 up through the 2021 event, SummerSlam had been held annually in August. The 2022 event, however, was the first SummerSlam to not be held in August, as it was instead held in July. It took place on Saturday, July 30, 2022, at the Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. The 2023 event was scheduled for Saturday, August 5, 2023, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, thus returning SummerSlam to the month of August. The 2023 event would break the 2021 event&#x27;s record to become the highest-grossing SummerSlam of all time, as well as the highest-grossing event outside of WrestleMania.

<doc id="697075" wikidata="Q2438228" url="?curid=697075" title="Charles Weidman">
<text>Charles Weidman (July 22, 1901 – July 15, 1975) was a renowned choreographer, modern dancer and teacher. He is well known as one of the pioneers of modern dance in America. He wanted to break free from the traditional movements of dance forms popular at the time to create a uniquely American style of movement. Born in 1901, he choreographed from the 1920s until his death in 1975. While he is most famous for his work with Doris Humphrey, Weidman did much work on his own. He created a bridge to a new range of movement that he only began to explore. His work inspired many and helped to create a whole genre of dance that is still evolving today.

==Career==
Charles Weidman began choreographing in a time of great change in American culture. He began his career as a dancer for the Denishawn Company, but soon decided to break free from their exotic style of movement and create a new style that was unique to America. He started the Humphrey-Weidman Company with Doris Humphrey in 1927, right in the midst of the Roaring Twenties. During this decade, society, art and culture were blossoming and thriving. Jazz music began to flourish, dancing became a popular activity, technology flourished, and the United States enjoyed a general sense of economic development. According to Weidman, &quot;It was a positive time, one that said yes to human values, a time full of vitality, there was that urgent need to express oneself but also to express the time in which one lived. There was a belief in the future&quot;. In a time when change was coming rapidly and innovations were popular, Weidman brought this to the dance world and changed dance forever. While Weidman began his choreography during this immense time of change, he also choreographed for four decades after he began. He worked through the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II. Although his work is not very political, his themes and ideas were designed to embody American culture.

==Ideas about dance==
Charles Weidman wanted to create a uniquely American style of movement. He wanted to develop movement that was not based on animals or bugs or fairy tale stories like the common themes in popular ballets. He also wanted to break free from the current ideas of modern dance embodied by the Denishawn Company (of which he was a member). He wanted to &quot;dance man and woman in America today&quot;. He was most famous for his work with Doris Humphrey, with whom he started the Humphrey-Weidman Company. The two met when they were dancing in the Denishawn Company (of Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis) and they soon after decided to create a dance company that built off a &quot;dance style that sprang from American Soil&quot;. Weidman&#x27;s work was completely new to the dance world because he was trying to break away from ballet&#x27;s nature of defying gravity to create a dance style that gave in to the natural &quot;pull of gravity&quot;.

==Technique==
Weidman&#x27;s movement vocabulary was based on gravity. In concentrating on this element, the &quot;fall was rediscovered.&quot; The idea was to explore how giving into gravity makes one fall, while balancing one&#x27;s body against gravity could create movement as well. In addition, he emphasized the movements that occurred before and after falling. From these ideas came suspension, or the &quot;body&#x27;s resistance to gravity&quot;; and succession, or the &quot;progressive unfolding of the body as an impulse flows from joint to joint&quot;. This created a whole new vocabulary of movements, which included much floor work, jumping, and falling. In addition to his unique new way of moving, Weidman brought a personal element to the dance world: his dramatic abilities. &quot;Arguably, no one has dramatic skill equal to Weidman&quot;. His choreography was expressive and usually very emotional. His work&#x27;s emotions ranged from comedy to seriousness—yet the expression is always important and always present in his choreography.

==Choreographic themes==
Weidman was also well known for the range of choreographic styles in which he worked. He worked in several different elements including religious, comedic, tributary and serious work. Arguably his most famous work, &quot;Flickers&quot;, was a comedic sketch of silent films, filled with &quot;jerky movements and corny situations&quot;. The piece is cut into four different reels that are four different stories or scenes. The pieces are very theatrical and comedic with many exaggerated facial expressions. Racial and sex stereotypes are exaggerated to a point of hilarity. In stark contrast Weidman choreographed a series called &quot;Atavisms&quot; which consisted of three pieces: &quot;Lynch Town&quot;, a choreographic depiction of a carnal and bloodthirsty mob acting like vultures about to devour their prey, &quot;Bargain Counter&quot;, and &quot;Stock Exchange&quot;. Weidman&#x27;s work &quot;This Passion&quot;, a suite of dances depicting popular murder cases, also gained renown. Another of Weidman&#x27;s major works was &quot;Brahms Waltzes&quot;, which was dedicated to Doris Humphrey &quot;because it was the kind of movement she loved and could dance so beautifully&quot;. Contrasted against that again was a series of dances made as tributes to his mother&#x27;s side of the family, called &quot;On My Mother&#x27;s Side&quot;; this featured a succession of dances based on different members of his mother&#x27;s side of the family. His later work includes his &quot;Oratorios&quot;, centered on religious themes, and of which Daniel Clay wrote: &quot;It is a work magnificent in its scope and power and is arguably Mr. Weidman&#x27;s master opus.&quot;

==Legacy==
Weidman changed the way dance was danced by working in different parameters. His contributions to the field were recognized when he received the Heritage Award in 1970. One of his former dancers said &quot;all male dancers took concepts from Charles.&quot; In his company he trained famous choreographers such as José Limón, Bob Fosse and Louis Falco. Charles Weidman created a new style of dance by rejecting ballet and embracing gravity. He helped lay the foundations for modern dance and many of his ideas are still the basis for modern dance today. Unfortunately, his work is not well known and has been hard to reconstruct because very little of it is on tape and only some of it is in Labanotation. Therefore, it has been up to his former dancers to reconstruct most of his works from memory. However, his passion, influence and ideas have had an important influence on the way movement is studied and created today.

Weidman was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.

<doc id="697076" wikidata="Q2113530" url="?curid=697076" title="William Bingham">
<text>William Bingham (March 8, 1752February 7, 1804) was an American statesman from Philadelphia. He was a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress from 1786 to 1788 and served in the United States Senate from 1795 to 1801. Bingham was one of the wealthiest men in the United States during his lifetime, and was considered to be the richest person in the U.S. in 1780.

==Early life==
William Bingham was born on March 8, 1752, in Philadelphia. He graduated from the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1768.

==Philadelphia Society==
Bingham first travelled to Europe in 1773 and, upon, returning to America joined the Philadelphia Society. Sent by the Committee of Secret Correspondence to Martinico (today&#x27;s Martinique), to reside ostensibly as a merchant and to establish communications through that colony with Silas Deane, the committee&#x27;s agent in France. He departed America aboard the frigate &quot;Reprisal&quot; on July 3, 1776. During his voyages, he established links with French merchants at Martinique, captured several British ships, and returned in 1777 to America with several full loads of munitions, guns, and other vital goods necessary for the fighting of a war.

==Business interests==

Toward the end of the American Revolution, Bingham was regarded as the richest man in the United States. He had made his fortune through joint ownership of privateers and trading. He became a major land developer, purchasing lands in upstate New York (present-day Binghamton) and 2 million acres (8,000 km2) in Maine (later known as the Bingham Purchase). He helped broker the Louisiana Purchase with Francis Baring and Henry Hope. Their agent Alexander Baring married his daughter Anne.

He was the founder and the first president of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike.

Bingham was director of several other enterprises. He maintained shipping ventures after the Revolutionary war, through his mercantile house Bingham, Inglis, and Gilmore. He was a leading member of the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and Useful Arts and donated a Philadelphia property to be converted into a textile factory.

===Mounted general===
During the 1780s, Bingham marshaled the Second Troop of Philadelphia Light Horse, an outfit of 50 dragoons. They were glamorously clad and saw little action. William Jackson was first major and later became Bingham&#x27;s land agent. Bingham escorted President-elect George Washington through Pennsylvania with his troop on his April 1789 journey from Valley Forge to New York City to assume the presidency.

Bingham was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1787.

==Politics==

During the provisional government of the United States at Philadelphia, he wrote the by-laws for the national Bank of North America. He saw the national debt as beneficial in that it attracted interest into the affairs of the government. During the first presidency, Treasurer Alexander Hamilton sought Bingham as his mentor in managing taxes, tariffs, and in constructing a national bank.

===Speaker of Pennsylvania House===
In America, he represented Pennsylvania as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1786 to 1788. In 1790 and 1791 he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving as its first speaker in 1791. He oversaw development of the land during a fledgling period of America as a member of the Society of Roads and Inland Navigation, where he worked closely with Albert Gallatin of western Pennsylvania. After unsuccessfully running in the 1792 election for Pennsylvania&#x27;s at-large congressional district, he was later elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1793 through 1794. He built roads and a bridge from Philadelphia to Lancaster, Pennsylvania called the Lancaster Pike.

===U.S. Senator===
By 1795, he was elected to the United States Senate where he served as a Federalist and Nationalist while it was originally at Philadelphia, but he left for England in 1801 when his wife had taken ill. In the midst of public debate and dissent focused on the Jay Treaty he was subjected to political violence in Philadelphia in the summer of 1795. He was an active supporter of John Adams and when Adams was elected president, Bingham served as the Senate&#x27;s President pro tempore in the Fourth Congress. On March 4, 1797, with the start of the Fifth Congress he administered the oath of office to Vice President Thomas Jefferson.
He was criticized by Jeffersonian politicians for &quot;extravagance, ostentation and dissipation&quot;. In 1813, nearly ten years after his death, John Quincy Adams said that the Presidency, the Capital and the Country had been governed by Bingham and his family connections.

The several Bingham estates were renowned for hosting many prominent aristocrats from Europe as well as Federalist meetings. At the Bingham estate, Federalists agreed to hold preliminary votings before propositions were brought before Congress publicly, thus creating unanimity among party lines.

==Binghamton==
He was also a land surveyor, and looked to develop areas currently a part of Southern New York, and Northern Pennsylvania. One of his prime prospects was at the confluence of the Chenango River and Susquehanna River. Judge Joshua Whitney Jr., settler and Bingham&#x27;s agent, called this town Binghamton to honor him. Furthermore, Binghamton&#x27;s resident university Binghamton University recognizes Bingham through the naming of Bingham Hall.

==Family==
He married Anne Willing, daughter of Thomas Willing, President of the First Bank of the United States, and they had two daughters and a son.

* Ann Louisa Bingham (1782–1848). In 1798, she married Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton. They were the parents of nine children.
* Maria Matilda Bingham (1783–1849), who, at the age of 15, was briefly married to a French aristocrat, Jacques Alexandre, Comte de Tilly. Afterwards she married her sister&#x27;s brother-in-law, Henry Baring. They were the parents of five children. Maria and Henry were divorced in 1824; she married the Marquis de Blaisel in 1826.
* William Bingham (1800–1852), who married Marie-Charlotte Chartier de Lotbinière (1805-1866), Seigneuresse de Rigaud, in 1822. She was the second of the three daughters and heiresses of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, by his second wife Mary, daughter of Captain John Munro. They lived in Montreal, Paris and London; and were the parents of six children. William Bingham settled in England and died in Kent in 1852.

Although his wife and two daughters factored prominently in the social affairs of American politics, Bingham&#x27;s wife Anne died while his only son William was one year old. William Sr. left William Jr. to grow up in America with his grandfather Thomas Willing.

Bingham died on February 7, 1804, in Bath, England and is interred in Bath Abbey. His estate remained in the family until the death of William Alexander Baring Bingham (1858-1915) but it was not settled until 1964.

===Portraits===
Bingham commissioned artist Gilbert Stuart to paint the Lansdowne portrait, a 1796 full-length portrait of President George Washington that became a gift to Lord Lansdowne. As British Prime Minister, Lansdowne had secured a peaceful end to the American Revolutionary War, and the portrait was commissioned soon after the American approval of the Jay Treaty. Stuart also painted portraits of Bingham, his wife and children.

<text>Humphrey-Weidman is a modern dance technique consisting of &quot;fall&quot; and &quot;recovery&quot; (losing and regaining equilibrium) that was invented by Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman. In 1928 Humphrey and Weidman founded a dance school to teach their technique and a dance company to perform it; both were disbanded by Humphrey in the 1940s.

<doc id="697097" wikidata="Q2089968" url="?curid=697097" title="Hell in a Cell">
<text>Hell in a Cell is a professional wrestling steel cage-based match which originated in 1997 in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It features a large cell structure, a four-sided cuboid made from open-weave steel mesh chain-link fencing which encloses the ring and ringside area. Unlike the steel cage match, the only way to get out of the Hell in a Cell without damaging the Cell&#x27;s structure is through its door—but this door is locked by thick chains and a padlock. Only an in-ring pinfall or submission will ordinarily result in a win (although Triple H pinned Chris Jericho atop the cell to win the Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day in May 2002) and there are no disqualifications. The gimmick was strongly associated with The Undertaker during his career with WWF/WWE, including the inaugural match with Shawn Michaels and a brutal encounter with Mick Foley in his Mankind persona. Both matches featured spectacular falls from the top of the cage which has since become a signature of the match. A Hell in a Cell match is often the most prestigious type of match in the WWE, often saved for the end of a feud that is usually the most popular feud over a months-long period.

The original Cell was high and weighed over two tons, but has since been replaced by a more robust version of and five tons. The first match took place at Bad Blood In Your House in October 1997 and a total of 53 Hell in a Cell matches have since occurred. The match type spawned its own pay-per-view event in 2009, WWE Hell in a Cell, after which the event was held annually in October, although once in September and twice in June. This event generally featured one to three Hell in a Cell matches on the same card, with the main event always contested as a Hell in a Cell match. Following Triple H&#x27;s appointment as WWE Chief Content Officer in August 2022, the Hell in a Cell annual event was discontinued alongside other gimmick PPVs except for WWE Money in the Bank, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and WWE Elimination Chamber.

==History==
The Hell in a Cell match was first introduced at Badd Blood on Sunday October 5, 1997, at the Kiel Center, now known as Enterprise Center, in St. Louis, Missouri. The background to the inaugural match was built on The Undertaker&#x27;s loss to Bret Hart two months prior at SummerSlam in a WWF Championship match which Shawn Michaels was assigned to referee. Michaels had deliberately interjected himself in the match and cost The Undertaker a win which resulted in a match between the two at In Your House: Ground Zero. That match was ruled a no-contest due to the two bypassing and attacking the officials. As a climactic end to the feud, their following bout was originally scheduled to be held as a steel cage match. However, a larger roofed structure was constructed instead of a normal cage enclosing only the ring, enclosing not only the ring but also the surrounding ringside area. The wider space between the ring apron and the cell walls allowed for entering and exiting the ring and for cameras to be situated at ringside. At Badd Blood, Michaels defeated The Undertaker (with interference from The Undertaker&#x27;s debuting half-brother Kane), becoming the number-one contender to the WWF Championship at the 1997 Survivor Series. The original concept for the Hell in a Cell structure was created by Jim Cornette. He described his concept as a combination of a cage surrounding the majority of the ringside area (the design, he stated, was popular in Memphis wrestling promotions) and the cage used in both the National Wrestling Alliance and World Championship Wrestling for their WarGames matches (which had a top on the cage). On an October 2015 video podcast, Vince Russo said Cornette probably did come up with the concept, but the name Hell in a Cell came from him. WWE credits the match as being based on the Last Battle of Atlanta.

The 1998 Hell in a Cell match between The Undertaker and Mankind remains one of the most iconic matches of all time, with its level of extreme violence and dangerous spots, which led to Mankind getting legitimately knocked unconscious at the end of the match and suffering multiple injuries towards the end of the match. Despite the match&#x27;s popularity, it remains controversial due to the wrestler&#x27;s lack of safety. In 2011, this incident was named the number one &quot;!&quot; incident in WWE history. Journalist Michael Landsberg called it &quot;maybe the most famous match ever.&quot; The first title defense in Hell in a Cell was at No Way Out in February 2000 with Triple H defending the WWF Championship against Cactus Jack. The first title change inside Hell in a Cell was in October 2009, when The Undertaker won the World Heavyweight Championship from CM Punk. The longest Hell in a Cell match was held at Bad Blood in June 2004 between Triple H and Shawn Michaels at over 47 minutes. The Undertaker has been involved in the most Hell in a Cell matches, having competed in fourteen and having the most victories at eight. All Hell in a Cell matches have been broadcast live on pay-per-view except for five matches, three of which were televised on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, later &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, with two in 1998 and one in 2021 and one on &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot; also in 2021. The Hell in a Cell match on the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; showcasing Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker against Kane and Mankind, ended with Austin and Undertaker winning after &quot;Raw Is War&quot; went off the air. On the August 24 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Mankind fought Kane (his tag team partner at the time) in a Hell in a Cell match. This match went to a no-contest after Austin interfered and assaulted Kane. On the June 18, 2021, episode of &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot;, the first televised title match contested inside the structure took place between Roman Reigns and Rey Mysterio for the WWE Universal Championship which saw Reigns retain the title via submission. Three days later on the June 21, 2021, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, WWE Champion Bobby Lashley faced Xavier Woods in a non-title Hell in a Cell match which saw Lashley win via submission. These matches, along with the two matches at the Hell in a Cell event, were held in a span of 4 days, with Lashley being the only wrestler to have competed in Hell in a Cell matches on back-to-back days. Only one Hell in a Cell match was not televised, the match took place on the September 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in 2011 as a dark match where John Cena retained the WWE Championship in a five-way match against Alberto Del Rio, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler, and CM Punk in a match that lasted only 5 minutes, making it the shortest Hell in a Cell match. Hell in a Cell matches have appeared at WWF/WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania four times (XV, XXVIII, 32, and 39). In 2009, WWE debuted its first pay-per-view event to be named Hell in a Cell.

In 2016, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks became the first women to step inside the Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell in October 2016 when Banks defended the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship against Flair, who won the match.

Ahead of Hell in a Cell in September 2018, the structure went through a significant overhaul. The fully crimson-red structure is smaller, with the wires being less pliable, making the structure stronger, yet lighter. Randy Orton and Jeff Hardy faced off against each other in the first crimson cell, a match which Orton won. The crimson cell would be swapped out for the standard gray one come WrestleMania 39 in 2023.

===Kennel from Hell match/Other appearances and variations===
The structure itself has made four additional appearances, although WWE does not consider them to be Hell in a Cell matches. During the first-ever First Blood match which was between Kane and Stone Cold Steve Austin at King of the Ring in May 1998, the cell used earlier in the night was lowered. The second featured Big Boss Man challenging Al Snow for the WWF Hardcore Championship in a Kennel from Hell match at Unforgiven in September 1999. The match consisted of a standard steel cage with the cell placed atop it and the object was to escape from both the cage and cell while trying to avoid guard dogs that were placed between the ring and cell door. Snow, the first competitor to escape the steel cage and the cell, was declared the winner. The third time was on September 28, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during a gauntlet match with John Cena against Chris Jericho, Big Show and Randy Orton. The cell was lowered after Cena defeated Jericho and Big Show by disqualification when Orton&#x27;s turn came. Cena ordered the cell to be lowered and then brawled Orton on top of the structure. The match was declared a no-contest. The fourth time was on October 20, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when the Hell in a Cell structure was lowered on orders from Kane during a handicap street fight involving Kane, Orton, and Seth Rollins against Cena and Dean Ambrose which Kane, Orton, and Rollins won. At Hell in a Cell in October 2017, Shane McMahon and Kevin Owens competed in a Hell in a Cell match billed as the first under Falls Count Anywhere rules (despite the Hell in a Cell previously having this stipulation in its rules by default). In October 2020, Roman Reigns and Jey Uso competed in the first-ever Hell in a Cell match contested under an &quot;I quit&quot; stupulation

==Reception==
The first Hell in a Cell match in 1997 between Undertaker and Shawn Michaels was highly acclaimed, with Dave Meltzer giving it 5 stars, a feat that no other Hell in a Cell match would accomplish until 2022 with Seth Rollins and Cody Rhodes &amp; 2024 with CM Punk and Drew McIntyre. Some critics claimed that the Hell in a Cell has been watered down during the later years, particularly during the 2010s, most notably the main event between Seth Rollins and &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt in 2019. Former WWE producer Arn Anderson said that WWE overused the concept, as not many rivalries justified a match of that caliber. Answering Anderson, Mick Foley said he did not think the Hell in a Cell had been overused.

She has won multiple awards throughout her career, including an Annie Award and a Saturn Award, in addition to a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Other early successes include the role of Dr. Jing-Mei &quot;Deb&quot; Chen in the medical drama series &quot;ER&quot; (1995–2004) and her voice role as Fa Mulan in the Walt Disney Animated Classic &quot;Mulan&quot;, as well as its sequel &quot;Mulan II&quot;, several video games and guest appearances in TV shows such as &quot;Sofia the First&quot;. Additionally, Wen made a cameo appearance in the live-action remake of &quot;Mulan&quot; (2020).

==Early life, family and education==

Wen was born on November 20, 1963, on Coloane, one of the two main islands of Macau. Her mother Lin Chan Wen moved to Macau in the 1950s from Suzhou, China, to escape communism. Her father is of Malaysian Chinese descent. She has an older brother Jonathan and a younger brother Leong.

Wen&#x27;s parents divorced when she was an infant, and she moved with her brother and mother to Hong Kong, where she attended a Catholic school. Her mother worked three jobs to provide for the family. Her mother remarried to Chinese American Soo Lim Yee, and when Wen was four years old, the family moved to New York City. Her younger brother Leong was born there. 

After five years, Wen&#x27;s mother and stepfather relocated their family to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, where they bought and operated the Chinatown Inn restaurant (established in 1943), which is still in business. They resided in the suburb of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Wen attended Mount Lebanon High School. She majored in theatre at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, graduating in 1986. 

==Career==

After starring in the film &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1993), Wen landed the role of Dr. Jing-Mei &quot;Deb&quot; Chen on the NBC drama series &quot;ER&quot;.

She played a college professor in the comedy series &quot;George Lopez&quot;.

From October 8 through October 29, 2007, Wen (billed as Ming Wen) appeared in a four-episode arc of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; playing Charlie Sheen&#x27;s love interest, a judge closer to his own age.

From December 5 to 6, 2008, Wen starred in a benefit production of the musical &quot;Grease&quot; with &quot;Stuttering John&quot; Melendez at the Class Act Theatre.

Wen was cast as a regular in the &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; television series from October 2009 to May 2011 as political attaché Camile Wray. Wen appears in &quot;Disney Through the Decades&quot;, a documentary short about the history of The Walt Disney Company, hosting the 1990s section.

Wen appeared on the Syfy series &quot;Eureka&quot; as the inquisitive U.S. Senator Michaela Wen, beginning in season four in 2011 and then serving as a major villain in the fifth and final season in 2012.

She is also well known for her work with Disney. &quot;WDW Magazine&quot; writer Aaron Widmar called Wen an &quot;incredibly talented Chinese actress, who has had a remarkable career that seems to only gain steam as it progresses — a rarity in Hollywood&quot;. He went on to say that she has &quot;broken through barriers for Asian performers&quot;. In a 2014 article by a Chinese evening magazine based in Kunming, China, the &quot;Spring City Evening News&quot; wrote that &quot;among the second-generation Chinese children who immigrated to the United States with their parents, Wen adhered to the excellent Chinese culture and etiquette.&quot; She was named a Disney Legend at the 2019 D23 Expo for her outstanding contributions to the Disney company.

<doc id="697111" wikidata="Q1494482" url="?curid=697111" title="Goodwin Sands">
<text>Goodwin Sands is a sandbank at the southern end of the North Sea lying off the Deal coast in Kent, England. The area consists of a layer of approximately depth of fine sand resting on an Upper Chalk platform belonging to the same geological feature that incorporates the White Cliffs of Dover. The banks lie between above the low water mark to around below low water, except for one channel that drops to around below. Tides and currents are constantly shifting the shoals.

More than 2,000 ships are believed to have been wrecked upon the Goodwin Sands because they lie close to the major shipping lanes through the Straits of Dover. The few miles between the sands and the coast is also a safe anchorage, known as The Downs, used as a refuge from foul weather. Due to the dangers, the area—which also includes Brake Bank—is marked by numerous lightvessels and buoys.

Notable shipwrecks include in 1703, in 1740, the in 1914, and the South Goodwin Lightship, which broke free from its anchor moorings during a storm in 1954. Several naval battles have been fought nearby, including the Battles of the Goodwin Sands (Battle of the Narrow Seas) in 1602 and the Battle of Dover in 1652, and the Battle of Dover Strait in 1917.

When hovercraft ran from Pegwell Bay, Ramsgate, they made occasional voyages over the Sands, where boats could not go safely.

Southeast from Goodwin Sands lies the Sandettie Bank.

==Navigational aids==

===History===
A simple fire beacon was first recorded at North Foreland in 1499, with the Sands first known depiction on a navigational chart by Lucas Janszoon Wagenaer in 1583. By 1634, two lighthouses at South Foreland provided a transit to enable crews to ensure they were a safe distance from the Sands. In 1795, the first lightship was positioned on the eastern edge of the Sands, and has been maintained ever since (despite short-lived experiments with fixed light beacons in 1840).

===Modern day===

The East Goodwin lightship guards the end of the Sands on the farthest part out, to warn ships. It is the only remaining lightship of the five which once guarded the sands. The sands were once covered by three lighthouses on the Kent mainland with only North Foreland lighthouse still in operation. South Foreland lighthouse, once known as South Foreland Upper lighthouse is now owned by the National Trust. This once worked with the nearby South Foreland Low lighthouse, also known as Old St Margaret&#x27;s Lighthouse. When the two South Foreland lights were in alignment ships’ crews would know that they had reached the South-most extent of the sandbank. When the Goodwin sands shifted, South Foreland Low was decommissioned and replaced by the South Goodwin Lightvessel. The first of these ships was bombed by the Germans and sank on 25 October 1940. The replacement vessel, LV90 sank on 27 November 1954, when cables to her two anchors broke in a hurricane-force storm. All seven crew were lost, with only one survivor - a visitor from the Ministry of Agriculture recording bird migration - rescued. The wreck of the lightship can still be seen at low tide. The next replacement South Goodwin Lightvessel was decommissioned and was towed away on 26 July 2006, replaced with a newer light vessel by Trinity House.

==Island of Lomea==
In 1817, borings in connection with a plan by Trinity Board to erect a lighthouse on the Sands revealed, beneath fifteen feet of sand, a stratum identified by Charles Lyell as London clay lying upon a chalk basement. Based on this, Lyell proposed that the Sands were the eroded remains of a clay island similar to Isle of Sheppey, rather than a mere shifting of the sea bottom shaped by currents and tides.

Lyell&#x27;s assessment was accepted uncritically until the mid-20th century, and enlarged upon by G. B. Gattie who asserted, based on unsourced legends, that the sands were once the fertile low-lying island of Lomea, which he equated with an island said to be known to the Romans as &quot;Infera Insula&quot; (&quot;Low Island&quot;). This, Gattie said, was owned during the first half of the 11th century by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, after whom the Sands are named. When he lost favour, the land was supposedly given to St. Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury, whose abbot failed to maintain the sea walls, resulting in the island&#x27;s destruction, some say, due to the storm of 1099 mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. However, the island is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, suggesting that if it existed it may have been inundated before the Domesday Book was compiled during 1085–86. The earliest written record of the name &quot;Lomea&quot; seems to be in the &quot;De Rebus Albionicis&quot; (published 1590) by John Twyne, but no authority for the island&#x27;s existence is given. There is a brief mention of a sea-tide inundation in 1092 creating the Godwin sands in a 19th-century book of agricultural records, reissued in 1969.

The modern geological opinion is that the island of Lomea probably never existed. Although the area now covered by sands and sea was once dry land, the Strait of Dover opened in the Weald-Artois chalk range in prehistory – between about 7600 BC and 5000 BC – not within historical time.

Another theory about the origin of the name is that the sands&#x27; name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;gōd wine&quot; = &quot;good friend&quot;, an ironic name given by sailors, or because ships can shelter from storms in the deep water known as The Roads between the Goodwin Sands and the British coast.

==Notable events==

===17th century===
* John, the son of Phineas Pett of Chatham, was involved with an ordeal in the beginning of October 1624, when occurred: 
 Phineas Pett received news of the shipwreck at Deal, and was dispatched by the Lord Admiral to attend to the ship and use his best means to save her. He used chain pumps, replaced the rudder, and fitted jury masts, by which effort she was brought safely to Deptford Dock.
* In October 1630, the &quot;Stella&quot; was driven onto Goodwin Sands in a storm. The ship was carrying nearly 300 Scottish and English soldiers from the Dutch Republic to the Republic of Venice for use in the War of the Mantuan Succession. All of the soldiers, including their commander, Colonel Sir John Swinton, drowned.
* In 1690 HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;, a 90-gun second-rate ship of the line, struck the Sands, but was fortunate enough to be got off by the boatmen of Deal.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Great storm of 1703

During the great storm of 1703 at least 13 men-of-war and 40 merchant vessels were wrecked in The Downs, with the loss of 2,168 lives and 708 guns. Yet, to their credit, the Deal boatmen were able to rescue 200 men from this ordeal.

Naval vessels lost to the sands included:
* , Deptford built, and from there manned locally, lost with all hands
* , Deptford built, and from there manned locally, lost with all hands
* , a 70-gun third-rate built at Deptford in 1679
* The Woolwich fourth-rate , totally overwhelmed with the loss of 343 men
* The boom ship HMS &quot;Mortar&quot;, lost with all 65 of her crew.

1740
The Dutch merchant ship &quot;Rooswijk&quot;, on her way to Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies, became a victim to the Goodwin Sands during a storm on 8 January 1740. It sank with the loss of everyone aboard, almost 250 sailors, soldiers and passengers. The silty environment has preserved the wreck for so long, however, shifting tidal flows started to expose the timbers and goods and thus resulted in its salvage in 2017 by Historic England and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands.

1748
According to legend the &quot;Lady Lovibond&quot; was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands on 13 February 1748, amidst alleged controversy concerning the cause of her sinking in which all persons aboard were lost. She is said to reappear every fifty years as a ghost ship. No references to the shipwreck are known to exist in contemporary records or sources, including newspapers, Lloyd&#x27;s List or Lloyd&#x27;s Register.

1809
 was wrecked in January 1809, with her cargo, a large number of East India Company X and XX copper cash coins, belonging to Matthew Boulton. The wreck was found in 1984 and some coins were salvaged in 1985 during a licensed dive.

1851
The brig was wrecked on the Sands in a storm in 1851; the lifeboat from Broadstairs rescued seven men of her crew.

1857
The mail paddle steamer SS &quot;The Violet&quot; was driven onto the sands during a storm on 5 January 1857 with the loss of seventeen crew, a mail guard, and one passenger.

===20th century===
The Belgian cargo ship was wrecked on the sands in 1907.

&quot;HMT Etoile Polaire&quot;, a naval trawler, was sunk by a mine laid by on the sands on 3 December 1915, during the First World War. On 16 January 1916, Admiralty Tug HM Tug Char sank after a collision with the Steamship &quot;Frivan&quot; in the area around South Goodwin Light Vessel.

Two ships named ran aground on the Sands, one in 1909 and the other in 1939.

The US cargo steamer (and former Liberty Ship) , battered by a gale, ran aground on Goodwin Sands on 12 September 1946. The ship broke her back on or about 21 September 1946, and was soon in two pieces. During 1947, both pieces were subsequently refloated and towed to port for scrapping.

The Liberian tanker Panther was grounded on the Sands on 30 March 1971. Over the next week attempts were made to pull the ship free, with five tugs managing to dislodge it on the 4 April. The ship was then beached on the Dutch coast, to be broken up. The accident caused the spill of several hundred tones of oil into the English Channel.

The passenger ship collided with the freighter &quot;Prospector&quot; near the Sands in June 1953, severely damaging and nearly sinking her.

The Radio Caroline vessel drifted onto the Sands in November 1991, effectively ending the era of offshore illicit radio in Britain.

===21st century===
On 10 June 2013, a Dornier Do 17 Z2 was raised from Goodwin Sands. The German bomber had made an emergency landing in the sea over the Sands on 26 August 1940 after a bombing raid. Two of the four-man crew were killed on impact, the remaining crew becoming POWs. The Dornier was located on the Sands in September 2008 and plans were made to recover it, as it is one of two surviving aircraft of this type.

The salvage started on 3 May 2013 with the plane destined eventually for RAF Hendon in 2015, though poor weather and the position of the plane on chalk rather than the silt expected caused the plan to be amended to attaching ropes to three points on the fuselage.
The plane was finally lifted on 10 June 2013.
It is believed to be from 7 Staffel, III Gruppe/KG3 (7th Sqn of 3rd Group of Bomber Wing 3) operating from Sint-Truiden aerodrome 60 km east of Brussels, shot down on 26 August 1940 by a Boulton Paul Defiant of No. 264 Squadron RAF, based in Hornchurch, either one crewed by Desmond Hughes and Fred Gash or one of the three 264 Squadron aircraft shot down soon after in a battle with Bf 109E fighter escorts of the German fighter wing JG 3.

==Potential port or airport site==
The August 1969 issue of &quot;Dock and Harbour Authority&quot; magazine had an article &#x27;A National Roadstead&#x27; which reported on a 1968 proposal to the Ministry of Transport for reclaiming the Goodwin Sands and constructing a deep water port on them.

In 1985, consultants Sir Bruce White Wolfe Barry and Partners promoted a proposal for developing an International Freeport combined with a two-runway airport located on three reclaimed islands on the sands.
 In 2003, the idea was still under consideration. Being far from residential areas it has the advantage of 24-hour-a-day take-offs and landings without causing disturbance.

In December 2012, the Goodwin Sands were once again promoted as a potential site for a £39 billion 24-hour airport to become the UK&#x27;s hub airport. Engineering company Beckett Rankine believes their proposals for as many as five offshore runways at Goodwin Airport are the &#x27;most sustainable solution&#x27; with the &#x27;least adverse impact&#x27; when compared to other options that have been proposed for the expansion of runway capacity in the southeast. They claim that this is due to the absence of statutory environmental protection on the Goodwin Sands and the alignment of the runways which avoids any overflying of the coast.

==Cricket==
In the summer of 1824, Captain K. Martin, then the Harbourmaster at Ramsgate, instituted the proceedings of the first known cricket match on the Goodwin Sands at low water. An annual cricket match was played on the sands until 2003, and a crew filming a reconstruction of this for the BBC television series &quot;Coast&quot; had to be rescued by the Ramsgate lifeboat when they got into difficulty in 2006.

When the Royal Marines School of Music was based at Deal, it played a game of cricket on a suitable day each summer.

==Athletics==
On 23 June 1994, Deal Striders hosted a 1-mile race on the Goodwin Sands in memory of the late Cliff Temple. Around 100 athletes and spectators set off from Dover on a cross channel hovercraft and landed on the sands at low water. A one-mile circuit was set up on the sands and the race started. In a punishing wind, the event was won by Matt de Freitas, with London Marathon winner Mike Gratton 2nd, and Olympic Steeplechaster Tom Buckner 3rd
==Controversial dredging==

After a two-year public consultation the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) granted Dover Harbour Board a licence to dredge 3 million tonnes of aggregate from the Goodwin Sands on 26 July 2018.

==Literary references==
William Shakespeare mentions the Sands in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Act 3 Scene 1:
:Why, yet it lives there uncheck&#x27;d that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.

Shakespeare also mentions Goodwin Sands in &quot;King John&quot;, Act 5 Scene 5:

: Messenger:The Count Melun is slain; the English Lords\ By his persuasion are again fall&#x27;n off,\ And your supply, which you have wish&#x27;d so long,\ Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.

Mary Wroth refers to Goodwin Sands as a place of shipwreck in her sonnet sequence &quot;Pamphilia to Amphilanthus&quot; (1621):
:Like to a Ship on Goodwins cast by winde, / The more shee strive, more deepe in Sand is prest... (Sonnet 6, 5-6).

Herman Melville mentions them in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Chapter VII, &quot;The Chapel&quot;:
:In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands...

R. M. Ballantyne, the Scottish writer of adventure stories, published &quot;The Floating Light of the Goodwin Sands&quot; in 1870.

W. H. Auden quotes the phrase &quot;to set up shop on Goodwin Sands&quot; in his poem &quot;In Sickness and in Health.&quot; This is a proverbial expression meaning to be shipwrecked.

G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rolling English Road&quot; refers to &quot;the night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.&quot;

Charles Spurgeon mentions them in &quot;The Soul Winner&quot;, chapter 15 &quot;Encouragement to Soul-Winners.&quot;
:Their theology shifts like the Goodwin Sands, and they regard all firmness as so much bigotry.

Ian Fleming refers to the Goodwin Sands in &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1955), one of the James Bond novels, as well as making them a major plot point in his children&#x27;s story &quot;Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&quot; (1964–65).

The sands are depicted in the 1929 film &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot;, which is sometimes known by the title of &quot;Goodwin Sands&quot;.

In the 2014 biographical film &quot;Mr. Turner&quot;, the first husband of the housekeeper Mrs. Booth is mentioned as having died in a boating accident at Goodwin Sands.

&quot;Old Goodman&#x27;s Farm&quot;, appearing in the Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;Brookland Road&quot; refers to the Goodwin Sands and the legend of their origin as an island belonging to Earl Godwin.

In the novel &quot;The Shivering Sands&quot; by Victoria Holt the Goodwin sands play a major plot point and the masts from wrecked ships are often sighted from the shore.

In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;Post Captain&quot;, Stephen Maturin explores the sands and must dive for his boots as the tide floods.

In the short story &quot;Flood on the Goodwins&quot; (1933) by Arthur Durham Divine, on a foggy night during the First World War, a German saboteur orders a British mariner at gunpoint to take him to the coast of Belgium. Instead, the mariner circles for hours and then, telling the saboteur they have reached Belgium, strands the German at low tide on the Goodwins, six miles from shore, knowing that the tide will drown the villain.

In Julian Stockwin&#x27;s &quot;Invasion&quot; the Sands are both a hindrance and protection for the British fleet assembled for the rapid deployment against Napoleon&#x27;s invasion armada. The protagonist Kydd even takes part in the rescue of a merchantman vessel being gale forced onto the Sands.

In Henry Williamson&#x27;s The Dark Lantern, Richard Maddison&#x27;s landlady lost her husband on the &#x27;Benvenue&#x27; at The Goodwins during &#x27;the great March gale of eighteen seventy one&#x27;.

<text>Big Trouble in Little China (also known as John Carpenter&#x27;s Big Trouble in Little China) is a 1986 American fantasy action-comedy film directed by John Carpenter, and starring Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall, Dennis Dun and James Hong. The film tells the story of truck driver Jack Burton (Russell), who helps his friend Wang Chi (Dun) rescue Wang&#x27;s green-eyed fiancée from bandits in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan (Hong), who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to be released from a centuries-old curse.

Although the original screenplay by first-time screenwriters Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein was envisioned as a Western set in the 1880s, screenwriter W. D. Richter was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize it. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed Eddie Murphy film, &quot;The Golden Child&quot;, which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter&#x27;s long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.

Despite receiving generally positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. This left Carpenter disillusioned with Hollywood and influenced his decision to return to independent filmmaking. In later years, the film gained a steady audience on home video, and has become a cult classic.

==Plot==
Truck driver Jack Burton wins a bet with his friend Wang Chi. To make sure he follows through on payment, Jack accompanies him to the airport to pick up Wang&#x27;s Chinese fiancée Miao Yin, where a Chinese-American street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl. She is being met by her friend Gracie Law. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead.

Jack and Wang track the Lords of Death to Chinatown, where they find a funeral procession that erupts into a battle between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese warrior societies. When &quot;The Three Storms&quot; – Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, warriors with weather-themed powers – appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack attempts to gun his big-rig through the crowd, but runs over Lo Pan, a magician directing the Three Storms. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan unhurt and glowing with magic. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; they escape, but Jack&#x27;s truck is stolen.

Wang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet with Gracie, her journalist friend Margo, Wang&#x27;s friend Eddie Lee, and magician Egg Shen, a local authority on mysticism and Lo Pan. They explain to Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in, but are interrupted by the Storms, who kidnap Miao Yin and take her to Lo Pan.

Jack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate telephone repairmen to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten, they meet Lo Pan. He now appears as David Lo Pan, an elderly and feeble businessman. Jack and Wang&#x27;s friends attempt to save them and are also captured.

Locked in a cell, Wang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan was defeated in battle by Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who cursed Lo Pan with incorporeality. Lo Pan can temporarily obtain a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, but he must marry and sacrifice Miao Yin to fully lift his curse. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack, Wang, and Eddie escape and free Gracie and Margo and a group of women kept in cells, but a Wild-Man recaptures Gracie before she escapes. Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too, and decides to sacrifice her while making Miao Yin his wife.

Wang and Jack regroup with the Chang Sing and Egg Shen, and enter a cavern to return to Lo Pan&#x27;s headquarters. Egg pours the group a potent potion. They interrupt the wedding and start a battle. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel and fights Thunder hand-to-hand. Jack and Gracie chase Lo Pan, who has regained his corporeal form by consuming a few drops of Miao Yin&#x27;s blood. Jack throws a knife at Lo Pan and misses. Lo Pan throws the knife back at Jack, who catches it and returns it to the former, which strikes him into the forehead, killing him.

Thunder finds Lo Pan dead, swells up with rage and explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered in a corridor by Lightning, who triggers a collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a Buddha statue on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack&#x27;s truck and dealing with the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group escapes back to Wang&#x27;s restaurant.

The group celebrates in the restaurant; Wang and Miao Yin prepare to marry, while Eddie pairs with Margo. With his old enemy defeated, Egg takes a long overdue vacation. Gracie offers to join Jack, but he leaves alone. Unbeknownst to him, the Wild-Man survived the battle and has stowed away on his truck.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
&quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; originated from a script by first-time screenwriters Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by a new wave of martial arts films that had &quot;all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities&quot;, such as &quot;The Butterfly Murders&quot;; Weinstein, for his part, was fascinated by the historical Tong Wars of 19th-century San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. The duo combined these interests with a shared fondness for classic westerns to write the first iteration of the screenplay. Entitled &quot;Lotus&quot;, the script took place in the 1880s: friends cowboy Wiley Prescott and Chinese railroad worker Sun are set to meet Sun&#x27;s fiancée Lotus as she arrives to San Francisco, but are opposed by sorcerer Lo Pan who captures Sun&#x27;s fiancée and separates Prescott from his horse as the story progresses into a mystical realm. They submitted the script to TAFT Entertainment Pictures executive producers Paul Monash and Keith Barish during the summer of 1982; the script, now renamed &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, was soon optioned by 20th Century Fox.

The Weird West setting of the screenplay led to objections from producers; Monash remarked that &quot;the problems [with the script] came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco.&quot; Because Goldman and Weinstein were unwilling to update their story to a modern setting, and from the producer&#x27;s desire to bring a new perspective to the writing, the original duo were removed from the project while screenwriter/script doctor W. D. Richter (Academy Award-nominated writer of &quot;Brubaker&quot;) was brought in to extensively rewrite the script. Richter modernized the setting to avoid distancing audiences; though basic elements of the story were retained, such as Lo Pan, Richter rewrote the story &quot;nearly from scratch&quot;. In particular, he approached the story as a comedy: the straightforward cowboy hero Prescott reimagined as the blowhard trucker Jack Burton. His draft was written in 10 weeks, a process that included research into Chinese mythology. While admitting that he invented or changed some lore, Richter expressed a desire for those portions of the script to be &quot;as authentic as possible&quot; despite coming from a white writer, contrasting his approach with modern criticisms of Charlie Chan.

Richter&#x27;s script was shopped around to directors by the studio. Fox wanted to deny Goldman and Weinstein writing credit, and eliminated their names from press releases in favor of solely crediting Richter. In March 1986, the Writers Guild of America, West determined that &quot;written by&quot; credit would go to Goldman and Weinstein, based on the WGA screenwriting credit system which protects original writers; Richter would instead receive an &quot;adaptation by&quot; credit for his work on the script.

===Direction===
The project was also offered to Richter to direct, due to its perceived similarity to his previous directorial outing &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;; however, Richter turned it down as he wished to direct smaller movies rather than another expansive action-adventure film. Barish and Monash first offered the project to Carpenter in July 1985, with the idea he would produce an adventure movie in the model of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;. Having found the earlier Goldman/Weinstein script creative but unfocused – &quot;too huge and bizarre&quot; – Carpenter was impressed by Richter&#x27;s scripting of &quot;an action/adventure/comedy/mystery/ghost story/monster movie&quot; and signed onboard. Carpenter made his own additions to Richter&#x27;s rewrites, which included strengthening the Gracie Law role by linking her directly to Chinatown, removing a few action sequences due to budgetary restrictions, and adjusting material that could offend Chinese Americans. Richter, who had befriended Carpenter while the two were attending USC film school, found that Carpenter&#x27;s notes built on what had already been established and made his part in the script-editing process easy. Carpenter remarked that the &quot;offbeat&quot; characters had a &quot;very 1930s Howard Hawks&quot; quality to them with respect to their rapid-fire delivery of dialogue, especially between Jack Burton and Gracie Law.

Carpenter had discovered a fondness for Hong Kong action cinema while in film school, with the &quot;strange, yet bloody and violent &quot;and&quot; innocent [and] &#x27;what &quot;is&quot; this exactly?&#x27; vibe&quot; of movies like &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot;, &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;, and &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot; providing inspiration. He saw &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; as the opportunity to fulfill a decade-long desire to make his own kung fu movie.
Carpenter and Russell saw the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films that featured a Caucasian protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in a climactic fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the battle begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On the commentary track recorded for the DVD release, Carpenter described the film as about a sidekick (Burton) who &quot;thinks&quot; he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio &quot;didn&#x27;t get it&quot; and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton. Carpenter came up with a prologue scene where Egg Shen reassures the audience (vis-à-vis a lawyer character) that &quot;Jack Burton is a man of courage.&quot;

===Competition with &quot;The Golden Child&quot;===

Production of &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; was partially shaped by its anticipation of competition with Paramount Pictures&#x27; upcoming &quot;The Golden Child&quot;. The two movies share similar themes, both comedic action-adventures following a Californian everyman drawn into a plot centering around Chinese mysticism. Carpenter himself had been offered &quot;The Golden Child&quot;, declining due to his commitment to &quot;Big Trouble&quot;; though he initially dismissed the films as &quot;not really similar&quot;, as production of &quot;The Golden Child&quot; progressed he came to view the two movies as &quot;basically the same&quot;.

The box-office draw of superstar Eddie Murphy led Fox to fear their movie would lose in a direct competition. To beat the rival production to in theaters, &quot;Big Trouble&quot; went into production in October 1985 so it could open in July 1986, five months before &quot;The Golden Child&quot;″s Christmas release. Carpenter was hired by 20th Century Fox because of his reputation for working fast, and the film had a limited preproduction schedule of 10–12 weeks.

===Casting===
Carpenter initially looked for a major star for the lead role to compete with &quot;The Golden Child&quot;″s casting of Murphy; the director wanted Clint Eastwood or Jack Nicholson, but neither actor was available. The studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star additionally, Russell had previously been directed by Carpenter in &quot;Elvis&quot;, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, and &quot;The Thing&quot; and the duo had developed a longstanding friendship. Russell was initially unsure if he could find an interesting way to play Burton, but valued working with Carpenter. After discussions with the director and rereading the script, he saw the movie as a opportunity to play a type of action hero that differed from his prior roles like Snake Plissken by mixing a leading-man archetype with comic-relief behavior: &quot;I&#x27;ve never played a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn&#x27;t the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. [...] He thinks he knows how to handle situations and then gets into situations he can&#x27;t handle but somehow blunders his way through anyhow.&quot; Russell took inspiration from John Wayne&#x27;s characters in portraying Burton, albeit heightening the bravado to a comedic level. Carpenter and Russell&#x27;s familiarity allowed the actor to improvise and explore outside the script during shooting.

Kim Cattrall, cast as Gracie Law, considered &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; an ideal role for that point in her career. Keen to avoid typecasting — first as a dramatic actress due to work in various TV dramas, then as a comedienne from roles in &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Police Academy&quot; — Cattrall saw the role as not only synthesizing both drama and humor but also showing new facets of her acting ability. Though her character is often in peril, Cattrall did not view Law as a damsel in distress: &quot;I&#x27;m not screaming for help the whole time. I think the humor comes out of the situations and my relationship with Jack Burton. I&#x27;m the brains and he&#x27;s the brawn&quot;. Carpenter liked how Cattrall had a &quot;comedic sense&quot; yet could be serious, standing up for her acting abilities against studio pressure to cast a &quot;rock star&quot; as the love interest.

Casting the Asian characters in the movie was approached with care. &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, released 1985, had drawn much controversy for its depiction of Chinese-Americans. Carpenter and producers met with community leaders to assuage concerns about the writing of the movie and hired a casting director who represented many Chinese and Asian-American actors.

Dennis Dun was drawn to &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; as he was a fan of Richter&#x27;s &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;. Carpenter was familiar with Dun&#x27;s role in &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, and met with the actor twice before casting him in the role of Wang Chi only a few days before principal photography. He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie, appreciating that, like him, Wang was second-generation American and could be portrayed as Chinese yet still &quot;a regular, American guy&quot; rather than &quot;foreign&quot; or a punchline as many of Dun&#x27;s previous roles had made him feel. The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun, who had &quot;dabbled&quot; in training as a kid and performed in Chinese opera as an adult.

===Principal photography===
Kurt Russell lifted weights and began running two months before production began to prepare for the physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week&#x27;s rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes.

Although the early exterior establishing scenes were filmed on location in Chinatown, most of the film was shot on sets built in the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Production designer John Lloyd designed the elaborate underground sets and recreated Chinatown with three-story buildings, roads, streetlights, sewers and so on. This was necessary for the staging of complicated special effects and kung fu fight sequences that would have been very hard to do on location. This forced the filmmaker to shoot the film in 15 weeks with a $25 million budget. For the film&#x27;s many fight scenes Carpenter worked with martial arts choreographer James Lew, who planned out every move in advance. Says Carpenter, &quot;I used every cheap gag – trampolines, wires, reverse movements and upside-down sets. It was much like photographing a dance.&quot;

===Visual effects===
Boss Film Studios handled the numerous effects for the film. Richard Edlund, head of Boss Film Studios, described &quot;Big Trouble&quot; as probably its favorite film at the time after &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The effects budget for the film was just under $2 million; though Edlund considered this barely adequate, as &quot;Big Trouble&quot; was Boss Film&#x27;s first project for Fox he viewed the production as an opportunity to secure further work from the studio. Richter&#x27;s script included many fantastical creatures and settings, though many were only loosely defined and left up to Boss Film to design the ultimate appearance of. Steve Johnson led work on many effects, including Lo Pan&#x27;s old age makeup (a wizened appearance inspired by Dick Smith&#x27;s work on &quot;Little Big Man&quot;) and transformation into his middle-aged form, the &quot;wild man&quot; (a shaggy-haired apelike demon), a fishlike &quot;sewer demon&quot; (designed by Screaming Mad George and puppeteered by Noble Craig), and the explosive death of Thunder. One of the most difficult effects was the &quot;Guardian&quot;, a floating creature dotted with eyeballs that scouts for Lo Pan. Also designed by Screaming Mad George, this complex effect took approximately 60 artists and cost over $100,000 to create due to its many points of articulation far more complex than the similar character Slimer the crew had created for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. It was powered by several puppeteers and dozens of cables to control its facial expressions. To create the appearance of the Guardian flying freely, two puppets were created a front and rear view and it was filmed with a proprietary matting system specially designed for it.

Though Carpenter found Edlund professional and straightforward to work with, he had concerns during production about the scale of Boss Film&#x27;s operation; the director would notice instances where they called to cut down on effects due to budget or capability, only for such concerns to recede when the company secured additional work (a pattern of behavior he had noticed with many effects shops). Edlund was surprised by these remarks, reflecting that despite limited preparation time the studio had no major difficulties on &quot;Big Trouble&quot;.

==Music==

With the soundtrack, Carpenter wanted to avoid a stereotypically &quot;Chinese&quot; sound, as he found that &quot;other scores for American movies about Chinese characters are basically rinky tink, chop suey music. I didn&#x27;t want that for &quot;Big Trouble&quot;&quot;. Carpenter instead focused on a general fantasy-music feeling with his trademark synthesizer scoring, bringing in a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll feel. As with several of his other film scores, Carpenter collaborated with Alan Howarth. The title theme, &quot;Pork Chop Express&quot;, was partially inspired by the temp score&#x27;s use of &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; by ZZ Top for the opening scene.

The theme song &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, which plays over the closing credits, was performed by The Coup De Villes — a group consisting of Carpenter alongside friends Tommy Lee Wallace (second-unit director on the film) and Nick Castle. Though all three members appear in the music video, the song was primarily performed by Carpenter excepting backing vocals by Castle.

Carpenter&#x27;s score was nominated at the 14th Saturn Awards for &quot;Best Music&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Opening in 1,053 theaters on July 2, 1986, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; grossed $2.7 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $11.1 million in North America, well below its estimated budget of $19–25 million, making it a box-office bomb. The film was released in the midst of the hype for James Cameron&#x27;s blockbuster &quot;Aliens&quot;, which was released 16 days after. On the DVD commentary for &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, Carpenter and Russell discuss this among possible reasons for the film&#x27;s disappointing box office gross.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Brimming with energy and packed with humor, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; distills kung fu B-movies as affectionately as it subverts them.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 53% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Ron Base, in his review for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, praised Russell&#x27;s performance. &quot;He does a great John Wayne imitation. But he&#x27;s not just mimicking these heroes, he is using them to give his own character a broad, satiric edge.&quot; Walter Goodman in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;In kidding the flavorsome proceedings even as he gets the juice out of them, the director, John Carpenter, is conspicuously with it.&quot; Writer Harlan Ellison, widely known in Hollywood for his brutally honest critiques, praised the film, writing that it had &quot;some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon that will give you release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives.&quot; In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;&quot;Little China&quot; offers dollops of entertainment, but it is so stocked with canny references to other pictures that it suggests a master&#x27;s thesis that moves.&quot;

However, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;special effects don&#x27;t mean much unless we care about the characters who are surrounded by them, and in this movie the characters often seem to exist only to fill up the foregrounds,&quot; and felt that it was &quot;straight out of the era of Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu, with no apologies and all of the usual stereotypes.&quot; Paul Attanasio, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, criticized the screenwriters for being &quot;much better at introducing a character than they are at developing one&quot;. David Ansen wrote, in his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;though it is action packed, spectacularly edited and often quite funny, one can&#x27;t help feeling that Carpenter is squeezing the last drops out of a fatigued genre.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Times&quot;, David Robinson felt that Carpenter was &quot;overwhelmed by his own special effects, without a strong enough script to guide him.&quot;

Alex Stewart reviewed &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; No. 83, and stated that the film was &quot;Amiable nonsense, delivered with panache by fearsome demons and flying swordsmen; and the jokes work. Wayne Crawford should take notes.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
After the commercial and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker. He said in an interview, &quot;The experience [of &quot;Big Trouble&quot;] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won&#x27;t work for them again. I think &quot;Big Trouble&quot; is a wonderful film, and I&#x27;m very proud of it. But the reception it received, and the reasons for that reception, were too much for me to deal with. I&#x27;m too old for that sort of bullshit.&quot;

It has since enjoyed a resurgence on television and home video, and has received a good deal of retroactive positive press. Some critics and fans considered it one of Carpenter&#x27;s best movies. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine voted &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; the 430th greatest film in their &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list.

==Home media==
&quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; was released on a two-disc special edition DVD set on May 22, 2001. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the DVD a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote, &quot;The highlight of this two disc set – which also features deleted scenes, an extended ending, trailers, and a 1986 featurette – is the pitch perfect Russell and Carpenter commentary, which delves into Fox&#x27;s marketing mishaps, Chinese history, and how Russell&#x27;s son did in his hockey game.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Onion A.V. Club&quot;, Noel Murray wrote, &quot;If nothing else, this is a DVD designed for &quot;Big Trouble&quot; cultists; it&#x27;s packed with articles from &quot;Cinefex&quot; and &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; that only a genre geek would appreciate.&quot;

A single-disc movie-only DVD version was later released, with the only special features being the Carpenter/Russell commentary and the theatrical trailer.

A Blu-ray Disc edition of the film was released on August 4, 2009. It contains the same content as the double-disc DVD release. In 2013, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom by Arrow Films as a regular case and Steelbook.

On December 3, 2019, Scream Factory released a two-disc &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; Blu-ray of the film in the U.S., which included a bevy of new bonus features.

==Other media==
===Sequel===
In June 2015, &quot;TheWrap&quot; reported that Dwayne Johnson was developing a remake to be produced under his Seven Bucks Productions film studio. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz were hired as screenwriters, with Johnson planned to star as Burton. Though Johnson expressed interest in having the original director involved in the film, Carpenter remained &quot;ambivalent&quot; about a remake and did not meet with Johnson. By 2018, Seven Bucks was instead developing the film to be a sequel rather than a remake. In a 2019 interview, screenwriter Stentz explained that his script had been for a remake and he had not been contacted about the film&#x27;s revised concept; he was unaware of any new scripts being commissioned and also suspected that the then-recent acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney had placed the project into limbo.

===Video game===
A tie-in video game of the same name was published in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. Critical reception was mixed.

===Comic book series===
On February 27, 2014, Boom! Studios announced they were working on a comic book series. The comic book is written by Eric Powell and John Carpenter with artwork by Brian Churilla. The series began in June 2014.

Boom! released a crossover limited series between Jack Burton and Snake Plissken titled &quot;Big Trouble in Little China/Escape from New York&quot; in October 2016.

A previously projected comic book series previewed by Top Cow Productions at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con failed to appear.

On June 14, 2017, Boom! announced a new four-issue limited series, to be published in September 2017, called &quot;Big Trouble in Little China: Old Man Jack&quot;, written by Carpenter and Anthony Burch, with art by Jorge Corona. Taking place in 2020, Jack Burton comes out of retirement to battle Ching Dai and save the world.

===Vinyl figures===
In February 2015, Funko released a line of ReAction and Pop! vinyl figures based on &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;.

===Board game===
On July 15, 2016, Boom! Studios announced a partnership with Everything Epic and Flipside to create a board game based on the film. It was released in 2018, and is a highly thematic cooperative miniatures board game for 1–4 players.

===Card game===
In August 2016, Upper Deck released the &quot;Legendary: Big Trouble in Little China&quot; deck-building card game. It is a semi-cooperative game for 2–5 players using the deck-building mechanic in which players purchase cards from a central pool to work together against the &quot;villain&quot; deck. The cards feature original artwork based on characters from the movie. It comes with 400 cards and a special playmat, and retails for around $40.

==Influence==

Marvel supervillain The Mandarin in the 1990s Iron Man comic run by John Byrne and John Romita Jr. was modeled in appearance after Lo Pan.

The film&#x27;s portrayal of the lightning sorcerer/demigod character has been occasionally described as an inspiration for the character of Raiden from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, introducing the archetype of a straw hat–wearing monk able to control lightning with his hands to non-Asian audiences (in traditional Chinese and Japanese culture, the lightning god has an appearance more similar to that of a traditional Asian creature). Additionally, the character David Lo Pan has been credited as the original inspiration for the soul-stealing Mortal Kombat villain Shang Tsung.

The twenty-third episode of the second season of the 2012 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; TV series, &quot;A Chinatown Ghost Story,&quot; uses concepts from the film, but renames the antagonist Lo Pan to Ho Chan and replaces the Storm figure Rain with Wind. In addition, James Hong (Lo Pan) reprises his &quot;Little China&quot; performance as the principal villain character.

The song &quot;We Have Candy&quot; by the South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord features lead singer Ninja reciting some of Jack Burton&#x27;s dialogue from the film.

In 2006, American experimental rock band Man Man released an album with the title &quot;Six Demon Bag&quot;, which is a reference to a line in the film.

A 2012 parody music video of the song &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; was entitled &quot;Lo Pan Style&quot; and featured the storyline and characters from the movie, including a cameo by James Hong.

New Zealand director Taika Waititi cited the film as an influence on &quot;&quot; (2017).

The &quot;Regular Show&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Fortune Cookie&quot; features a villain called The Warlock, who bears a resemblance to Lo Pan; he also played by James Hong.

The title of the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Big Trouble in Little Sanchez&quot; is a reference to the film.

In the &quot;Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Big Trouble in Little Norrisville,&quot; the titular place is a reference to Little Chinatown (the title of the episode also references the film). James Hong (who played Lo Pan) also provides a guest voice role as the Shopkeeper.

The American hard rock band Lo-Pan is named after Hong&#x27;s character in the movie.

<doc id="697115" wikidata="Q6979598" url="?curid=697115" title="Gákti">
<text> is the Northern Sámi word used by non-Sámi speakers to refer to many different types of traditional clothing worn by the Sámi in northern areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. The gákti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer. The traditional Sami outfit is characterized by a dominant color adorned with bands of contrasting colours, plaits, pewter embroidery, tin art, and often a high collar. In the Norwegian language the garment is called a &#x27;kofte&#x27;, and in Swedish it is called &#x27;kolt&#x27;.

==Characteristics==
The colours, patterns and decorations of the costume can signify a person&#x27;s marital status and geographical origin. There are different gákti for women and men; men&#x27;s gáktis are shorter at the hem than women&#x27;s. Traditionally the gákti was made from reindeer skin, but in modern times, wool, cotton or silk are more common. The gákti can be worn with a belt (pleated, quilted or with silver buttons), silver jewellery, traditional leather footwear and a silk scarf. Traditionally, if the buttons on the belt are square, it shows the wearer is married. If they are round, the person is unmarried. If a married couple divorce, and the ex-husband still continues to use the Sami costume made by his ex-wife, he states by this that he wants her back. 

== In other Sámi languages ==
&quot;Gákti&quot; is the Northern Sámi term for the clothing. The following terms in other Sami languages do not refer to the Northern Sami gákti, but their own clothing:

South Sámi: 

Ume Sámi: 

Pite Sámi: 

Lule Sámi: 

Inari Sámi: 

Skolt Sámi: 

Kildin Sámi: 

Ter Sámi: ()

==Fake gákti==
The Finnish tourist industry is notorious for displaying fake Sámi culture for tourists in order to make profit. Ethnically Finnish actors dress up in fake &quot;gáktis&quot; and perform fake &quot;traditional rituals&quot;. This activity has been met with criticism both from the Sámi and Finns since it creates a false image of and appropriates Sámi culture, diverts tourist industry money from ethnic Sámi to ethnic Finns (thereby the Sámi and Sápmi, land the Sámi are native to, without giving anything back) and is dishonest towards tourists.

<doc id="697123" wikidata="Q17032548" url="?curid=697123" title="Waiting for God (TV series)">
<text>Waiting for God is a British sitcom that ran on BBC1 from 28 June 1990 to 27 October 1994 starring Graham Crowden as Tom and Stephanie Cole as Diana, two spirited residents of a retirement home who spend their time running rings around the home&#x27;s oppressive management and their own families. It was written by Michael Aitkens.

The show became very successful, running for five series. The programme is still repeated in the UK on various channels, most notably Gold and Drama. Series one to five have run (and in some cases continue to run) on PBS in the United States, and in New Zealand the show has aired various times since 2002. In 2004, it came 37th in the poll for Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom.

==Plot==
Set at the fictional Bayview Retirement Home near Bournemouth, the show was based on Diana Trent and her relationship with Tom Ballard, a former accountant with semi-feigned dementia. He has been exiled there for the convenience of his family.

Diana is a cynical, retired photojournalist who has found herself consigned to the retirement home after a career documenting some of the 20th century&#x27;s most dangerous events has left her single and with no one in her life outside of her niece, and later, her grand-niece. Her frustration at the prospect of years of being alternately patronised and ignored at Bayview is soon channelled into attempts to subvert the régime of the retirement home and taunting the staff regarding their flaws and corrupt nature. Though retired, Diana remains connected with several powerful journalists, which she uses to blackmail the board of directors at Bayview (and Bayview manager Harvey Bains) to allow her to stay in Bayview despite her disruptive behaviour. Her only known living relatives are her niece Sarah and later, Sarah&#x27;s daughter Diana. Sarah runs a modelling agency and loves Diana, though Diana is emotionally distant from her niece, going so far as to tell people that her niece runs a prostitution ring and constantly attempts to kill her with poison. Her nickname for Sarah is &#x27;The Clapham Strangler&#x27;. As the series progresses, the two become closer after Sarah undergoes a whirlwind courtship and marriage that results in pregnancy; the marriage fails but produces &quot;the Diana of the Future,&quot; as the new Grand-Aunt Diana blesses the newborn. Just before Baby Diana arrives, the grand-aunt-to-be reveals that much of her hostility towards the world stems from the fact that she is infertile; this incapability is one of her very few regrets in life.

Tom is a kindly but deluded old duffer who frequently lives in a fantasy world following his retirement as an accountant. A widower for at least a decade, his increasingly eccentric behaviour leads his alcoholic and adulterous daughter-in-law Marion and henpecked son Geoffrey to move him into Bayview where he finds himself living next door to Diana. The two form an unlikely partnership and discover that they are able to wreak havoc amongst the younger staff and management in the home in order to create a more tolerable living environment for themselves and their fellow residents. Tom&#x27;s optimistic, cheery demeanour and unencumbered Anglican Christianity contrast Diana&#x27;s dark cynicism and avowed atheism, as both attempt to influence the other&#x27;s world view.

The manager of Bayview is Harvey Bains, who runs the establishment with his assistant, the homely, spinsterish and pious Jane Edwards. Bains is a penny-pinching weasel whose management style involves trying to run the retirement home profitably while keeping the residents (whom he variously dubs &quot;oldies&quot;, &quot;inmates&quot;, &quot;units&quot;, &quot;wrinklies&#x27;, or &quot;droolers&quot;) passive in order to make himself look good before the eyes of the board of directors.

Both Tom and Diana refer to Bains as &quot;the idiot Bains&quot;, a reference to Harvey&#x27;s general lack of common sense regarding his various schemes to promote himself and Bayview to the outside world.

Jane, Harvey&#x27;s put-upon assistant, is a naïve and religious woman who is madly in love with Harvey, in spite of Harvey&#x27;s utter disdain for her. Jane serves as a foil for Diana; although Diana loathes Jane&#x27;s religious piety and optimistic outlook on life, she seems to genuinely care about Jane&#x27;s wellbeing, as evidenced by her and Tom&#x27;s attempts to help Jane when it comes to the matter of dealing with Harvey&#x27;s manipulation of Jane&#x27;s love for him.

During the third series, Tom and Diana get together as a couple after a one-night stand, though Diana is far more casual about the new state of their relationship, much to the chagrin of Tom, who wants a committed relationship. In series four, Diana&#x27;s financial situation collapses and Tom discovers that his room is infested with damp. Tom forces Harvey to upgrade him to a new apartment in Bayview and allow Diana to live with him as his lady friend. By series five, the two become engaged along with Harvey and Jane, who first get together as part of a cynical scheme to get Harvey accepted into an exclusive country club. When the plan fails, and Jane responds by quitting her job to begin the process of becoming a nun, Harvey realises that he has come to enjoy Jane being in his life and the two go through with their vows. But Diana gets cold feet regarding her impending marriage to Tom (much to her niece Sarah&#x27;s shock). Tom discovers this before the wedding and saves Diana from having to either go through with the wedding or have her niece sever all ties with her aunt, by calling off the wedding just as the two were about to say &quot;I Do&quot;.

Much of the humour is derived from flying in the face of conventional expectations about how the elderly ought to behave in their old age and how many of the residents do not want to settle down. One character, Basil Makepeace, is forever propositioning the female residents of the home, bragging about his innumerable conquests (on one occasion he muses about the indignities of growing old, commenting that now &quot;three or four times...a night is all I can manage&quot;). As an octogenarian, he does quite well. The other source of humour comes from the lengths that Harvey Bains will go to in his quest for success and how he and Marion scheme to separate Tom and Diana, the two blights on their mutual existences. The series is also unusual in that it is told largely from the vantage point of the (largely well adjusted) elderly characters, with most of the younger characters depicted as buffoons, who are either neurotic or inept.

==Cast==
Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) – A curmudgeonly old woman who constantly complains about the state of the world and the way the elderly are treated. If someone tries to insult her, she sees it as a compliment because she sees it as being the only way to stay alive. A constant thorn in Bayview manager Harvey&#x27;s side, Diana often irritates those around her with her bleak outlook, and admits it is the only thing that keeps her going; however, it is borne out of a genuine sense of right and wrong, and she can be ferocious when protecting those she cares about (particularly Tom and her niece Sarah). Diana is a retired photojournalist, having specialised in combat zones, with the things she has seen contributing to her pessimistic world view. She also takes great pleasure in making other people&#x27;s lives miserable, with stunts such as &quot;stealing&quot; her niece&#x27;s red Porsche. Although Diana is a pensioner, Cole was just 48 when she took the role.

Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) – An optimistic, jolly old man; in many ways the polar opposite of Diana. However, he shares her sense of justice (and her enjoyment of troublemaking) and the two become good friends (but often with an uneasy relationship). Tom affects a mild dementia and frequently takes imaginary trips to other places (mentally checking out of the retirement home), telling tall tales of his exploits, often involving celebrities. This is to make up for his boring life as an accountant. Although he seems like a &#x27;daffy old coot&#x27;, when the chips are down he always knows exactly what is going on and has already worked out the best way to handle the problem. His dull son, Geoffrey, and Geoffrey&#x27;s annoying, offensive wife, Marion (who have a financial stake in Bayview), often visit him despite Marion&#x27;s reluctance. Tom, however, has the measure of both of them.

Jane Edwards (Janine Duvitski) – Harvey&#x27;s prudish, homely and devout Catholic assistant who always looks on the bright side of life, despite Diana&#x27;s constant attempts to bring her down to earth. She often thinks up new ideas for the home, often backed up by Tom, and whilst Diana is irritated by Jane much of the time, she recognises the good in her and more than once protects her from Harvey&#x27;s attempts to get rid of her. Jane has an unrequited passion for Harvey, whom she often touches on the shoulder, to which Harvey replies disgustedly, &#x27;Jane... you&#x27;re touching me&#x27;. She is often shocked by what Diana says, with &#x27;Oh Diana!!&#x27; becoming something of a catchphrase. A sensitive person, she often ends up running away in tears if anyone mentions anything about Harvey having a relationship with someone other than her or her never getting married.

Harvey Bains (Daniel Hill) – The greedy, vain manager of Bayview who constantly tries to cut costs, with the money saved usually going into his own pocket. He complains that the &quot;oldies&quot; aren&#x27;t &quot;efficient units&quot; and would happily get rid of them all - especially Diana, who constantly thwarts his budget-slashing schemes. Although constantly pursued by Jane, Harvey is largely oblivious to this (or else ignores it), preferring the idea of a more glamorous female companion. His plain-spoken mother, Esme Sutherland (played by Vilma Hollingbery), whom he considers &#x27;common&#x27;, appears in one episode of Series 3, in which it is also mentioned that he has a sister. His father, whom he never knew, was an American gangster. He wears a wedding band.

Geoffrey Ballard (Andrew Tourell) – Tom&#x27;s good-hearted but incredibly dull son, whose chief interests in life are DIY and real ale. He is a successful businessman, but his personal life is a disaster - he feels trapped in his marriage to the often vicious Marion, and will sometimes use his father as a sounding board. Geoffrey is frequently insulted by Diana, but is usually too meek to stand up to her, and largely tolerates her behaviour because of her affection for Tom. Geoffrey and Marion have two children, Tarquin and Sky, who appear in one episode of Series 3, in which they are very rude and obnoxious towards Tom, but are soon firmly put in their place by Diana. Inconsistently, there are 3 children in the car in the first episode as they take Tom to Bayview.

Marion Ballard (Sandra Payne) – Geoffrey&#x27;s pill-popping, gin-swilling wife; a generally unpleasant woman who sees Tom purely as a financial burden. She is unfaithful to Geoffrey more than once, and uses alcohol and tranquilizers to escape from her financially secure but unexciting life. If she sees an opportunity to kiss another man, even if Geoffrey is around, she will do it. Marion later leaves Geoffrey for New Age philosophies (along with the equally troubled Reverend Dennis Sparrow), but does not last very long.

===Minor characters===
Basil Makepeace (Michael Bilton) – An elderly but very randy man who spends most of his time trying to seduce the female residents. He also boasts about his sexual conquests and is not shy about attempting to kiss women 60 years younger than himself, even though he is not very successful in this area. He has a girlfriend whom he does not marry, even though she wants to marry him. He also does not want to give up his crown as the resident sex symbol of Bayview. At the end of series 4, Michael Bilton died. Basil is referred to as traveling during the special, &quot;Another Christmas at Bayview&quot;.

Jamie Edwards (Paddy Ward) – Jane&#x27;s Irish grandfather, introduced in the special, &quot;Another Christmas at Bayview&quot; and continued through series 5.

Jenny (Dawn Hope) – A care worker at the home who, unlike Jane, sees through Harvey&#x27;s dodgy ways, and often agrees with Diana&#x27;s protests against the Bayview regime. Jenny has a daughter, Mandy, who is seen in one episode of Series 3.

Antonio (Chico Andrade) – A Portuguese gardener, often berated by Diana for his lack of skill. Diana normally speaks to him in pidgin French due to her inability to speak Portuguese (though Antonio shows no sign of understanding French).

Sarah Snow (later Parry) (Lucy Aston) – Diana&#x27;s niece, who runs a successful modelling agency in London. Diana usually feigns indifference to Sarah, but it is obvious that deep down she cares very much for her. Sarah marries the crooked businessman Sam Parry (Christopher Bowen) during Series 2: the marriage does not last long, but it does result in Sarah having a child. The baby girl is the apple of Diana&#x27;s eye and is named &#x27;Diana&#x27; after her great-aunt. Sarah calls Diana &quot;Aunty&quot;. Diana hates the term and constantly says, &quot;Don&#x27;t call me &#x27;Aunty&#x27;.&quot;

The Reverend Dennis Sparrow (Tim Preece) – The world-weary and inept local vicar, who becomes a semi-regular character from Series 3 onwards, and can generally be relied on to make a hopeless mess of any church service that he attempts to conduct. Marion runs away with him to explore New Age philosophies at the beginning of Series 3, although this does not last long.

==Location==
Although the script of the series is set in Bournemouth, the location filming for the first three series was largely carried out in and around Brighton and Worthing. The first genuine appearance of Bournemouth town centre and the nearby suburb of Boscombe is in the 1992 Christmas special.

Most exterior scenes at the retirement home were filmed at and around the Oaken Holt Rest Home in Farmoor, Oxfordshire, England.

==Music==
&quot;Waiting for God&quot;&#x27;s theme music is from the middle of the fifth movement of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout Quintet&quot;, when the first theme is recapitulated in E, performed by the Nash Ensemble. Other music heard in the show included the third movement, also performed by the Nash Ensemble.

==Derived work==
It was announced in 2013 that series creator Michael Aitkens would be staging a play, &quot;Heaven Forbid!&quot;, based on &quot;Waiting for God&quot;, at The Hawaii Theatre, starring Patty Duke and actor and TV newscaster Joe Moore.

In April 2017 a theatre version, also called &quot;Waiting For God&quot;, written by series creator Michael Aitkens, premiered at the Broadway Cinema, in Letchworth Garden City. The play was directed by David Grindley and starred Jeffrey Holland as Tom and Nichola McAuliffe as Diana, featured Joanna Bending as Sarah Chase, David Benson as Geoffrey Ballard, Peter Cadden as Dennis Sparrow, Samuel Collings as Harvey Baines and Emily Pithon as Jane Edwards, as well as Corinna Marlowe and Anna Westlake. Holland replaced Roy Hudd, who withdrew from the production during rehearsals.

==Episodes==
Forty-seven episodes were made, all starring Cole and Crowden. All episodes were written by Michael Aitkens and most were directed by Gareth Gwenlan. Five episodes of Series 2 were directed by Sue Bysh.
