<doc id="707510" wikidata="Q2913706" url="?curid=707510" title="Super Street Fighter II">
<text>is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the fourth game in the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; sub-series of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games, following &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; (1992). It refines and balances the existing character roster from the previous versions, and introduces four new characters, including Cammy and Dee Jay. It is the first game on Capcom″s CP System II hardware, with more sophisticated graphics and audio over the original CP System hardware used in previous versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;.

&quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was ported to the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis home consoles in 1994 followed by a number of computer platforms later. &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was followed in 1994 by &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, a fifth version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, which further balances the characters and adds features.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; features the following changes from &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot;.

===Graphics and audio===
The HUD and all of the stages and character portraits feature new graphics. The original opening sequence and unused sequence, which has two generic characters fighting in front of a crowd, was replaced by a new opening featuring lead character Ryu launching a &quot;Hadouken&quot; projectile toward the screen. . The music and sound effects were remade and a new announcer was introduced, who also recorded new voice samples for Ken, Guile, and Sagat.

===Other new features===

&quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; features a new scoring system tracking combos, first attacks, reversals, and recoveries made by the player, and awards bonus points accordingly.

Players choose one of eight character color schemes: the character&#x27;s original color scheme, their color scheme from &quot;Champion Edition&quot; and &quot;Hyper Fighting&quot;, or one of five new color schemes.

The faster game speed introduced in &quot;Hyper Fighting&quot; was reduced to the same speed level as &quot;Champion Edition&quot;. The faster game speed would later return in &quot;Super Turbo&quot;.

===Tournament Battle===
An alternate version of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; that features eight-player single-elimination tournament gameplay. &quot;Super Street Fighter II: The Tournament Battle&quot; requires four networked arcade cabinets. This edition consists of three sets of four simultaneous matches: the initial eliminations, the semifinals, and the finals. After the first set, the players are re-arranged by outcome. The winning players are sent to either of the first two cabinets, and losing players are sent to the others. In the finals, the players competing for first place are sent to the first cabinet, the third-place players to the second cabinet, and so on.

==Characters==
All twelve World Warriors from the previous &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games return, many with basic and special techniques refined to adjust the overall balance. Some of the characters received new special techniques such as Ryu&#x27;s &quot;Fire Hadōken&quot; (renamed &quot;Shakunetsu Hadōken&quot; in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series), a flaming &quot;Shoryuken&quot; for Ken, Zangief&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Buster&quot;, and M. Bison&#x27;s &quot;Devil Reverse&quot;.

Four newcomers are introduced: T. Hawk, a Native American warrior from Mexico whose ancestral homeland was taken from him by Shadaloo; Fei Long, a Hong Kong movie star who wishes to test his martial arts against real opponents; Dee Jay, a kickboxing musician from Jamaica seeking inspiration for his next song; and Cammy, a 19-year-old female special forces agent from England with a mysterious past tied to M. Bison. Eight opponents are chosen at random, followed by the four Shadaloo Bosses (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and M. Bison).

==Home versions==
===Super NES===

The Super NES version of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, released on June 25, 1994 in Japan, and during the same month in North America and Europe, is the third &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game released for the console, following the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; (a clone of &quot;Hyper Fighting&quot; from the Arcade). It is on a 32 megabit cartridge supporting the XBAND online network. It has several new game modes such as Group Battle and Time Challenge, and the eight-player Tournament mode from the arcade version, in addition to the previous games&#x27; Arcade and Versus modes. Several levels of speed can also be chosen. Like in the SNES version of &quot;Turbo&quot;, the background music stops between rounds and restarts from the beginning at the next round. Unlike the Sega Genesis version, the SNES version has the blood for the character&#x27;s beat up portraits removed or replaced with sweat due to Nintendo&#x27;s strict censorship policy at the time. This version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 8, 2011, the PAL region on April 12, 2012, and in North America on April 26, 2012. The Japanese version appeared on the Super Famicom Classic Edition, but was replaced by &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; in the SNES Classic Edition.

===Mega Drive/Genesis===
The Mega Drive/Genesis version was released simultaneously with its SNES counterpart in all three regions, almost identical. Like the SNES version, the Genesis version supports the XBAND online network although only for its North American release. The Genesis version is on a 40 Megabit cartridge, with additional voice clips of the announcer such as stating the names of the fighters (in place of &quot;you win&quot; or &quot;you lose&quot; on the SNES version). In the Options menu, the player can choose to play the Super Battle mode on &quot;Normal&quot; or &quot;Expert&quot; difficulty; the latter increases the number of opponents from the arcade version&#x27;s 12 to all 16 characters. Several levels of speed can also be chosen.

===Sharp X68000===
The X68000 version was released exclusively in Japan on September 30, 1994. The graphics are reproduced faithfully from the arcade version, with only a few omissions made (the message when a new challenger interrupts a match in 1-Player mode has differently-colored fonts, and the aurora in Cammy&#x27;s stage is a different color). For voices, all the spatial processing and echo processing specific to the CP System II hardware were removed. Like the X68000 version of &quot;Street Fighter II Dash&quot;, the game is compatible with multiple pulse-code modulation (PCM) drivers on a X68030 or higher models. A message from the game&#x27;s sound team is hidden in one of the ADPCM sound files containing music. Like the previous X68000 version, it was sold with an adapter for the CPS Fighter joystick controller.

===Fujitsu FM Towns===
The FM Towns version was released exclusively in Japan on October 28, 1994. The player characters reproduced faithfully from the arcade version, but the backgrounds lack the original&#x27;s parallax scrolling effect. The Q-Sound soundtrack of the arcade version is reproduced faithfully in this version, with an arranged version offered as an alternative (this version was later featured in the 3DO version of &quot;Super Turbo&quot; and console versions of &quot;Hyper Street Fighter II&quot;). A color edit that allows players to alter each character&#x27;s color scheme was added. Like the X68000 version, it also included an adapter for the CPS Fighter joystick controller.

===Other Versions===
&quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was ported to MS-DOS by Rozner Labs and published by Capcom in 1996 (despite the fact that its successor, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, had already been ported to the same system by Eurocom and published by GameTek the year prior).

The game was ported to the Amiga computer by Freestyle Software and published by U.S. Gold in 1995.

It is in the original &quot;Street Fighter Collection&quot; for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, released in 1997. However, this version lacks the 8-player tournament that appeared in the arcade and on other versions.

A home arcade cabinet featuring &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Turbo&quot;, and &quot;Champion Edition&quot;, was released by Arcade1Up.

It is in the &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Windows and PlayStation 4.

==Reception==


===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; in its November 1, 1993 issue as being the most-popular table arcade game at the time. It became the sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1994 in Japan.

In North America, Capcom launched the game with up to 1,000 &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; units distributed to arcade operators on a revenue-sharing basis. &quot;RePlay&quot; reported that &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was the most-popular arcade game in November 1993. &quot;Play Meter&quot; later listed &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; as the eighth most-popular arcade video game and fifth top arcade conversion kit in January 1994.

In early 1994, Capcom projected sales of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; to reach 100,000 arcade units sold worldwide.

===Home Versions===
In Japan, the Super Famicom version was the third best-selling video game of 1994 with 941,000 sales that year, In North America, it topped the Sega Genesis and Super NES sales charts for two months in 1994, from July to August. By the end of the year, the Sega Genesis version had outsold the SNES version in the United States, with the Genesis version becoming one of the year&#x27;s top ten best-selling video games in the region. Eventually, copies were sold worldwide.

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave a generally positive review of the Genesis version. They wrote that it was a solid conversion of the arcade game, but &quot;&quot;Super&quot; was never the game it could have been in the arcades, and the same imbalances and flaws that hurt the coin-op still affect the home versions.&quot; They said the new features were &quot;pretty cosmetic or just downright boring and unimportant&quot;, and that music and voices of the Genesis version were all inferior to the SNES version, but concluded &quot;&quot;Super&quot; is still &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; is still the best fighting game ever made&quot;. They gave a more positive review for the SNES version, while citing some of the same issues with the core game.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the SNES version 28 out of 40 (7 out of 10 average), with all four reviewers concurring that though it was the best version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; to date, the additions were limited given how many versions had already been released, and Capcom should have put out a &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; with new mechanics instead. They made similar comments on the Genesis version, and two of the reviewers additionally criticized it more than the Super NES version, such as the poor quality of the digitized voices.

===Accolades===
In the February 1994 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was nominated for Best Game of 1993, ultimately ranked at third. In the category of Best Fighting Games, &quot;Super&quot; won three more third-place prizes in the categories of &quot;Best Fighting Games&quot;, &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, and &quot;Best VGM&quot; (video game music). Cammy, who was introduced in &quot;Super&quot;, placed fifth in the list of Best Characters of 1993, with Dee Jay and T. Hawk at 36 and 37.

In 1994, &quot;Mega&quot; magazine listed &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; as the second Best Game of All Time. In 1995, Total! rated the game 6th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games.&quot; They lauded &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; writing: &quot;One of the finest beat-‘em-ups and one of the most well-crafted games ever.&quot; In 2018, Complex ranked the game 26th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 10th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time.

<doc id="707515" wikidata="Q336307" url="?curid=707515" title="Randall Davidson">
<text>Randall Thomas Davidson, 1st Baron Davidson of Lambeth, (7 April 1848 – 25 May 1930) was an Anglican bishop who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1903 to 1928. He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the Reformation, and the first to retire from it.

Born in Edinburgh to a Scottish Presbyterian family, Davidson was educated at Harrow School, where he became an Anglican, and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the high-church and low-church factions of the Church of England. He was ordained in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a curate, he became chaplain and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald Campbell Tait, in which post he became a confidant of Queen Victoria. He rose through the church hierarchy, becoming Dean of Windsor (1883), Bishop of Rochester (1891) and Bishop of Winchester (1895). In 1903 he succeeded Frederick Temple as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.

Davidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics. Under his leadership the church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; were frustrated by Parliament.

Though cautious about bringing the church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming Parliament Act 1911; urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the First World War and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the 1926 General Strike. He was a consistent advocate of Christian unity, and worked, often closely, with other religious leaders throughout his primacy. On his retirement he was made a peer; he died at his home in London at the age of 82, eighteen months later.

==Early years==
Davidson was born in Edinburgh on 7 April 1848, the eldest of the four children of Henry Davidson, a prosperous grain merchant, and his wife Henrietta, &quot;née&quot; Swinton. Both parents were Church of Scotland Presbyterians – Henry&#x27;s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were Presbyterian ministers. The family was, nonetheless, in Davidson&#x27;s words, &quot;very undenominational ... I have no recollection of receiving any teaching upon Churchmanship, either Episcopal or Presbyterian, the religion taught us being wholly of the personal sort but beautiful in its simplicity.&quot; Davidson&#x27;s biographer George Bell writes that the Davidsons were deeply religious without being solemn, and that it was a happy household. Davidson was educated by his mother and a succession of governesses and private tutors, before being sent, aged 12, to a small private school at Worksop in the English Midlands. The teaching there was inadequate; in particular, Davidson regretted all his life his lack of grounding in Latin and Greek.
In 1862, at the age of 14, Davidson became a pupil at Harrow School. The school was Anglican in its religious teachings and practices, and he took part in confirmation classes. Scarlet fever prevented him from being confirmed along with the other boys at Harrow, and he was confirmed in June 1865 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square by the Bishop of London, Archibald Campbell Tait, a longstanding friend of Henry Davidson. The greatest influences on Davidson at Harrow were Henry Montagu Butler, the headmaster, and Brooke Foss Westcott, his second housemaster. Davidson was inspired by Butler&#x27;s sermons and by Westcott&#x27;s wide-ranging instruction on topics from architecture and poetry to philosophy and history. Davidson and Westcott became lifelong friends, and each came to turn to the other for advice.

In the summer holidays of 1866, before his final year at Harrow, Davidson suffered an accident that affected the rest of his life. While rabbit-shooting along with his brother and a friend, Davidson was accidentally shot in the lower back. The wound was severe and could have been fatal, but he slowly recovered. He recalled:

Although Davidson gradually made an unexpectedly good recovery, the accident marred his last year at Harrow, where he had hoped to compete for several senior prizes; it also ruined his chances of an Oxford scholarship.

Davidson went up as a commoner to Trinity College, Oxford, in October 1867. The college was undistinguished at the time, and Davidson found the Trinity faculty disappointingly mediocre. Although high-church versus low-church controversies were rife in Oxford, he was not greatly interested in them, being, as always, more concerned with religious than with liturgical considerations. His chief aim was to complete his studies and go on to be ordained as a priest. His health affected his studies; he had hoped to study Greats (classics and philosophy), but as a result of his injuries he had, he later said, &quot;intense difficulty in concentrating thought on books&quot; and opted for the less demanding subjects of law and history. He graduated with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree, conferred in November 1871.

After leaving Oxford, Davidson rejoined his family in Scotland and then went with his parents on a six-week tour of Italy. On his return he began a course of study in London with Charles Vaughan, Master of the Temple, with a view to ordination. Davidson&#x27;s health was still precarious, and after three months he was obliged to abandon his studies. After further rest and another leisurely holiday, this time in the Middle East, he resumed his studies in October 1873 and completed them the following March.

==Curate and chaplain==

One of Davidson&#x27;s closest friends from his Oxford days was Craufurd Tait, son of Archibald Campbell Tait. Like Davidson, Craufurd was preparing for ordination; his father was by now Archbishop of Canterbury, and the two friends were accepted for ordination as deacons in the Archbishop&#x27;s diocese. They were ordained in March 1874, and Davidson was assigned as curate to the vicar of Dartford in Kent. He was ordained priest the following year. During his two and a half years at Dartford, Davidson served under two vicars; the first was a moderate high churchman and the second a moderate evangelical. Bell writes that the young curate learnt a good deal from each, &quot;both in pastoral work and in piety&quot;.

Late in 1876 Craufurd Tait, who was working as his father&#x27;s resident chaplain and private secretary, wished to move on and the Archbishop chose Davidson to succeed him. In May 1877 Davidson began work at Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop&#x27;s home and headquarters, beginning what Bell describes as &quot;an association with the central life of the Church of England which lasted more than fifty years&quot;. Craufurd Tait died after a brief illness in May 1878; his mother never recovered from this blow and died within the year. Despite the Archbishop&#x27;s offers of several attractive parishes over the following years, Davidson felt his place was at the side of the bereaved Tait, who came more and more to rely on him, and called him a &quot;true son&quot;. Bell sees this as altruism on Davidson&#x27;s part; later biographers have suggested that there may also have been an element of personal ambition in his decision to remain at the centre of church affairs.

On 12 November 1878 Davidson married Edith Murdoch Tait (1858–1936), the nineteen-year-old second daughter of the Archbishop. Cosmo Lang, Davidson&#x27;s friend and eventual successor at Canterbury, described the marriage as a &quot;perfect union of mind and spirit&quot;. Edith Davidson became known as a gracious hostess and a supportive wife. There were no children of the marriage.
Over the next four years Davidson played an increasingly influential role at Lambeth Palace. He grew to know Tait&#x27;s mind thoroughly, and the Archbishop placed complete confidence in his son-in-law, delegating more and more to him. Davidson took the lead on Tait&#x27;s behalf in the controversy in 1881 between high-church proponents and evangelical opponents of ritualism; in 1882 he played an important part in discouraging Anglican overtures to the Salvation Army, an organisation in which he thought too much power was in the hands of its general.

In 1882 Tait told Davidson that he hoped to be succeeded either by the Bishop of Winchester, Harold Browne, or the Bishop of Truro, Edward White Benson. Tait did not think it correct to make his preference known to Queen Victoria or the Prime Minister, W. E. Gladstone, but after Tait&#x27;s death in December 1882 Davidson ensured that the Archbishop&#x27;s views became known to the Queen. Within days she sent for Davidson and was impressed: she wrote in her diary that she was &quot;much struck ... Mr. Davidson is a man who may be of great use to me&quot;. In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; Stuart Mews comments that at the age of 34 Davidson quickly became the trusted confidant of the 63-year-old queen. When Benson was chosen to succeed Tait, Victoria asked Davidson&#x27;s views on who should be the next Bishop of Truro; she also consulted him about a successor to the Dean of Windsor, Gerald Wellesley, who died in 1882 after 28 years in the post.

Davidson remained at Lambeth Palace as chaplain and secretary to Benson, but in May 1883 the new Dean of Windsor, George Connor, died suddenly after only a few months in office. On Benson&#x27;s advice, the Queen appointed Davidson to the vacancy.

==Dean==

At Windsor, Davidson served as Dean – and also as the Queen&#x27;s private chaplain – for six years. She became increasingly attached to him; they developed closer personal relations after the death of her youngest son, Leopold, Duke of Albany, in March 1884. That, and other private tribulations, led her to turn to Davidson for religious consolation and thus, in Bell&#x27;s words, &quot;to give him more and more of her confidence in a quite exceptional way&quot;. The Queen consulted Davidson about all important ecclesiastical appointments from 1883 to 1901. In other matters his advice was not always to her taste, and tact was needed to persuade her to change her mind. He wrote in his diary, &quot;There is a good deal more difficulty in dealing with a spoilt child of sixty or seventy than with a spoilt child of six or seven&quot;, but he later said, &quot;my belief is that she liked and trusted best those who occasionally incurred her wrath, provided that she had reason to think their motives good&quot;. His biographers cite his tactful but resolute counsel that Victoria would be imprudent to publish another volume of her &quot;Leaves from the Journal of a Life in the Highlands&quot;. She reluctantly followed his advice.

As well as advising the Queen, Davidson remained a key adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Benson wrote to him nearly every day, and particularly depended on him in 1888–1890 during the trial of Edward King, the high-church Bishop of Lincoln, on a charge of unlawful ritualistic practices. Davidson helped to influence church and public opinion by writing in &quot;The Times&quot;; he also helped Benson by liaising with Lord Halifax, a prominent Anglo-Catholic layman. While Dean of Windsor, Davidson collaborated with Canon William Benham in writing a two-volume biography of Tait, which was published in 1891.

==Bishop==
===Rochester===
By 1890 it was clear that despite the Queen&#x27;s reluctance to lose him from Windsor, Davidson&#x27;s promotion to a bishopric was overdue. He was offered the choice between two vacant dioceses: Worcester and Rochester. At the time – before the creation of the diocese of Southwark – Rochester included all London south of the River Thames, and was the third-largest in England. Davidson chose it in preference to Worcester, explaining to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, that from his years at Lambeth he knew the area and its clergy so well that he was certain he could do more there than in Worcester, which he hardly knew.

In Westminster Abbey on 25 April 1891 Benson consecrated Davidson as a bishop. Eleven days later Davidson fell dangerously ill from a perforated ulcer, and was confined to his house in Kennington for six months. His enthronement at Rochester Cathedral had to be postponed until October, when he was able to resume his work. During a miners&#x27; strike in 1893 he was prominent in pleading for a decent standard of living as an essential condition for the settlement of labour disputes. His politics were not radical; he did not join the Christian Social Union set up by Westcott and others in 1889 to bring the tenets of Christianity to national economic and social affairs. He focused on the role of the church: Christian charity, he believed, required it to do everything possible to help relieve the poor. He rejected the idea that &quot;in any department of social life ... we can safely brush aside even for an hour the consideration of what Christ would have us do&quot;. Appointed Clerk of the Closet immediately after his consecration, he remained in close touch with Queen Victoria. He continued to be Benson&#x27;s close and loyal ally in the work of the church, particularly during 1894–95 when Halifax and other high churchmen attempted to draw the Archbishop into negotiation with Rome to seek papal recognition of Anglican orders.

In 1895, towards the end of his time in the diocese, Davidson&#x27;s seniority as a bishop entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. He relished the ability to contribute to debates, but he had suffered three more spells of illness during his four years in south London, and it became plain that his health was too poor for him to continue in the exceptionally demanding post of Bishop of Rochester.

===Winchester===

In 1895 Davidson accepted the offer of translation to the largely rural diocese of Winchester, where the workload was less onerous. He renewed his regular contact with the Queen, who spent much time in the diocese, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Archbishop Benson died the following year and was succeeded by the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple. The Queen vetoed a proposed offer of the vacant bishopric of London to Davidson, on the grounds that his health would not stand it. Temple, unlike his two predecessors, did not turn to Davidson for advice; he had a reputation for isolating himself from all the bishops and their views. Davidson greatly regretted his sudden exclusion from national church affairs.

Within his diocese Davidson was drawn into controversy over a high-church breach of canon law by Robert Dolling, a fervent Anglo-Catholic priest, who liked to be called &quot;Father Dolling&quot;. Davidson discovered that Dolling had installed a third altar at his newly built church, to be reserved for masses for the dead. The Church of England disowned the Roman Catholic belief in Purgatory and the efficacy of praying for souls in it. Davidson saw Dolling and tried to reach a compromise that would bring the latter&#x27;s practices within Anglican rules. Dolling refused to compromise and resigned, leaving the diocese. His supporters were critical of Davidson; Mews cites a high-church journalist who concluded that the episode left its mark on Davidson &quot;in forming his determination not to be the archbishop who drove the high-church party out of the Church of England&quot;. Though traditionally Protestant in his rejection of some aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine such as Benediction, he thought his evangelical colleagues were too easily upset by &quot;incense, copes and other adornments&quot;, which had no doctrinal significance.

Davidson was at the bedside of the dying Queen Victoria, and played a major role in the arrangements for her funeral in early 1901. When the see of London again fell vacant in February 1901, on the death of Mandell Creighton, it was offered to Davidson, who refused it on firm medical advice. He spoke frequently in the House of Lords, particularly on such topics as education, child protection, alcohol licensing, and working hours in shops. He involved himself when he could in national church policy. His grasp of the issues impressed the Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, who recorded that &quot;the Bishop has the art of stating with great clearness and sympathy the gist of opinions from which he differs&quot; and said that he understood the position of Halifax and the Anglo-Catholic lobby better after discussing it with Davidson.

Balfour continued to seek Davidson&#x27;s advice. The government sought to reform primary education, and Davidson&#x27;s input to the framing of the Education Bill of 1902 was greatly valued by Balfour, as was his advice on how to defend the bill against vociferous nonconformist opposition, led by the Baptist minister John Clifford. Behind the scenes, Davidson was a key contributor to the coronation of Edward VII in August 1902; the Dean of Westminster was ill, and Davidson was called on to arrange the order of service and to act as the link between Buckingham Palace and Lambeth Palace. Four months after crowning the King, Archbishop Temple died and Balfour nominated Davidson as his successor.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==
When Temple was appointed in 1896 there had been three candidates under consideration for the Archbishopric; in 1902 Davidson was the only one. It was a generally popular choice, except among the more militant Anglo-Catholics. He was enthroned at Canterbury on 12 February 1903. From the outset, Davidson, unlike Temple, was happy to turn to colleagues for advice. In a 1997 study, Edward Carpenter describes the most prominent of them: John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury, &quot;a man of great if somewhat restricted ecclesiastical learning&quot;; Francis Paget, Bishop of Oxford, &quot;a scholar and theologian&quot;; Edward Talbot, Bishop of Rochester, &quot;a practical Diocesan&quot;; Cosmo Lang, Bishop of Stepney and later Archbishop of York, &quot;a fellow Scotsman who made Lambeth his London home and became almost indispensable&quot; and Lord Stamfordham, who had been Queen Victoria&#x27;s private secretary.

Davidson&#x27;s constant concern was for what he called &quot;the great central party in the English Church&quot;. He was a prime mover in efforts to update the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; to make it comprehensible to 20th century congregations, and he aimed to accommodate all the clergy of the Church of England within Anglican doctrine, bringing the few high-church extremists back into obedience to church rules. With his cautious support, Balfour set up a Royal Commission to enquire into and propose remedies for the prevalent disorders in the church. It concluded that the church needed more control over its own affairs, but that the laws governing its practices must be enforced. Davidson was neither a diehard conservative nor an adventurous reformer, but steered a middle course. On the government&#x27;s wish to reform the marriage laws to allow a widower to marry his late wife&#x27;s sister he opposed reform (unsuccessfully); on the interpretation of the Athanasian Creed he took a liberal line.
In August 1904 Davidson, accompanied by his wife, sailed to the United States to attend the triennial convention of the American Episcopal Church; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to visit the US. He met many church leaders in the US and Canada, and established closer links between the Anglican churches of England and North America. This accomplishment abroad was followed by a setback at home: Davidson&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to bring political leaders to agree about national education policy. The Liberals had opposed the passage of the 1902 Education Act, and once in office in 1906 they reopened the issue. Their attempts at further reform were opposed by the Conservatives, and from 1906 to 1908 Davidson strove to bring the two sides to compromise. His failure to secure agreement and achieve a cohesive primary education system was one of the major regrets of his life. In 1907 Davidson disappointed some Liberals by not explicitly backing state old-age pensions, but he declined to do so merely in the abstract, insisting on detailed proposals before expressing support. He was much more forthcoming on atrocities by the Belgians in the Congo and the Bulgarians in Macedonia, which he condemned vehemently.

===Lambeth Conference, 1908===
In July and August 1908 Davidson presided over the fifth Lambeth Conference of bishops from the world-wide Anglican communion; 241 bishops were present. The chief subjects of discussion were: the relations of faith and modern thought; the supply and training of the clergy; education; foreign missions; revision and &quot;enrichment&quot; of the Prayer-book; the relation of the church to &quot;ministries of healing&quot; such as Christian Science; the questions of marriage and divorce; organisation of the Anglican Church; and reunion with other churches. Public interest focused on the bishops&#x27; desire for Christian unity. The resolutions showed a will for reunion, but a caution in taking any step towards the nonconformists that might destroy the possibility of ultimate reunion with the Roman Catholic or Orthodox churches.

===Domestic affairs, 1909–1911===
In 1909 David Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer found his radical budget blocked by the Conservative majority in the House of Lords; a few bishops voted for or against the government&#x27;s bill, but Davidson, like most of the 26 Lords Spiritual, abstained. Partisans, both conservative and radical, criticised Davidson for his abstention, but he felt that being identified with one side or the other in party politics would bring the church into disrepute.

The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, secured the King&#x27;s reluctant agreement to create as many new peerages for government supporters as was necessary to secure a majority in the Lords. At the end of April 1911 Davidson convened a private meeting at Lambeth Palace to try to resolve the constitutional impasse; the other three attending were Balfour, Lord Knollys and Lord Esher – respectively, Leader of the Opposition, the King&#x27;s private secretary, and an influential politician and courtier. Balfour said that if invited by the King, he would consider forming a minority Conservative government, so that the question of creating new Liberal peers would not arise; he subsequently decided that he would not be justified in doing so. A week after this meeting Edward VII died, and was succeeded by George V.

The Lords continued to resist the will of the Commons, even after a general election fought on the issue. Asquith proposed the 1911 Parliament Bill, to enshrine the supremacy of the Commons in British law, and King George followed his father in agreeing to create hundreds of Liberal peers, should it become necessary to ensure the bill was passed. Davidson, having unsuccessfully striven to bring the party leaders to compromise, voted for the bill. The votes of the Lords Spiritual were crucial in its passage through the Lords, where the majority was only 17. The two archbishops and eleven bishops voted with the government; two bishops voted against. There were strident protests that the bishops were harming the church by taking sides, but Davidson had come to regard this as a matter on which the church must take a stand. He believed that were the bill not passed, the creation of what he called &quot;a swamping majority&quot; of peers would make Parliament and Britain a worldwide laughing-stock, and would have grave constitutional implications for church and state. His speech in the Lords was credited with tipping the balance.

On 22 June 1911, Davidson presided at the coronation of the new sovereign. The service largely followed the form he had arranged for the 1902 service, except for a revised coronation oath, less offensive to the King&#x27;s Roman Catholic subjects, and Davidson&#x27;s crowning of both King George and Queen Mary. In contrast, in the 1902 coronation, Queen Alexandra had been crowned by the Archbishop of York. When the King left Britain for the Delhi Durbar later in the year, Davidson was one of the four Counsellors of State appointed to transact royal business in the monarch&#x27;s absence.

===Kikuyu controversy 1913–1914===

Skirmishing between Anglican factions continued with the Kikuyu controversy in 1913–14. William George Peel, who was the Bishop of Mombasa and John Jamieson Willis, the Bishop of Uganda, attended an interdenominational missionary conference at the Church of Scotland&#x27;s parish in Kikuyu, British East Africa, during which they took part in an ecumenical communion service together with their nonconformist colleagues. For this, and their agreement to cooperate with other churches in their missionary work, they were denounced by Frank Weston, the Bishop of Zanzibar. Weston, described by Mews as a &quot;champion of Anglo-Catholic hardliners&quot;, sought their trial for heresy. He was backed by the Bishop of Oxford, Charles Gore, the most vociferous of the Anglo-Catholic bishops. Davidson&#x27;s private view was that the attending bishops had been &quot;rash&quot; but the denunciations by Weston and Gore &quot;preposterous&quot; and &quot;absurdly vituperative&quot;. The issue was debated in the press for several weeks but Davidson&#x27;s inclusive and pragmatic views prevailed, and the controversy dwindled away.

===First World War, 1914–1918===
The outbreak of the First World War was a severe shock to Davidson, who had held that war between Britain and Germany was inconceivable. But he was clear that it was a just war in which it was Britain&#x27;s duty to fight because of &quot;the paramount obligation of fidelity to plighted word and the duty of defending weaker nations against violence&quot;. He was reconciled to allowing clergy to serve as non-combatants, but not as combatants.

When a group of theologians in Germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the German government, Davidson was ready to respond. At the government&#x27;s request he took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders, including some with whom he had differed in the past, to write a rebuttal of the Germans&#x27; contentions but unlike some of his colleagues in the church, Davidson, in Bell&#x27;s words, &quot;felt the horror of war too keenly to indulge in anti-German rhetoric&quot;. As &quot;The Times&quot; put it, &quot;He was never betrayed into the wild denunciations and hysterical approval of war to which some ecclesiastics gave utterance&quot;. He donated to a fund to help Germans and Austro-Hungarians in Britain, where they were classed as enemy aliens.

Throughout the war Davidson criticised the use of what he considered immoral methods of warfare by the British side. Most of his objections were made privately to political leaders, but some were public, and he was bitterly attacked for them. Mews records &quot;hate mail flood[ing] into Lambeth Palace&quot;. Davidson protested against the false information put out to hide British military reverses, the use of poison gas, the punitive bombing of Freiburg in April 1917 and the targeting of non-combatants. In 1916 he crossed to France for an eight-day visit to combatant troops at the Western front.

While the war was going on, civil strife in Ireland was another matter of concern to Davidson. He spoke against the death sentence passed on Sir Roger Casement for his part in the Easter Rising, and post-war condemned the violence of the Black and Tans.

In the last year of the war Davidson had to deal with further agitation from the high-church faction. Gore took exception to the liberal theology of Hensley Henson and attempted to thwart the Prime Minister&#x27;s nomination of Henson for a bishopric. Opinion among the laity and most of the clergy was against Gore. Davidson, who hated unnecessary conflict, was distressed by the controversy, and even considered resigning. But, despite Henson&#x27;s fear that the Archbishop might weaken, Davidson stood by him, and the two agreed that Henson would issue a statement of faith to silence the critics. Davidson then stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read Henson&#x27;s sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests.

Throughout the war, Davidson distanced himself from pacifism. For him, Christian idealism must be accompanied by political realism. He maintained that alongside prayer and witness, Christians had a &quot;duty to think&quot;, and that peace would come &quot;when we have given our mind – yes, mind as well as heart – to these new and brave resolves&quot;. With this conviction in mind, he was a strong supporter of the League of Nations when it was set up after the war.

===Enabling Act, 1919 and Welsh disestablishment, 1922===
Up to this point the Church of England had little power to make its own rules. As the established church it was subject to parliamentary control, and had no independent authority to initiate legislation. The Enabling Act, strongly backed by Davidson, gave the church the right to submit primary legislation for passage by Parliament. The historian Jeremy Morris calls it &quot;probably the most significant single piece of legislation passed by Parliament for the Church of England in the twentieth century&quot;, and summarises its effects:

Davidson failed to achieve his aims over Welsh disestablishment. Unlike England, Wales had long been mainly nonconformist; the Anglican church there was widely seen as that of the ruling elite, and its legal status as the official church of the principality was strongly resented. The historian Callum G. Brown quotes the view that &quot;church disestablishment was to Wales what home rule was to the Irish&quot;. There had been pressure since the 1880s for disestablishment, and bills to bring it about had been unsuccessfully put to Parliament in 1894, 1895, 1911 and 1912. Davidson was against disestablishment, but Parliament finally voted for it in 1914 and after considerable delay it came into effect in 1922.

===Lambeth Conference, 1920===

At Davidson&#x27;s instigation the sixth Lambeth Conference was held as soon as practicable after the end of the war. It met at Lambeth Palace in July and August 1920; 252 bishops attended. The bishops reaffirmed the Lambeth Quadrilateral – the four fundamentals of the Anglican Communion&#x27;s doctrine. From this starting-point they developed the major initiative of the conference, the &quot;Appeal to all Christian People&quot;, which set out the basis on which Anglican churches would seek to move towards union with churches of other traditions.

Other resolutions of the conference welcomed the League of Nations &quot;as an expression of Christianity in politics&quot;, affirmed the eligibility of women for the diaconate, and declared marriage an indissoluble and life-long union, with no acceptable ground for divorce except adultery. The bishops denounced birth control, spiritualism, and attempts to communicate with the dead. Christian Science and theosophy were stated to involve grave error, but were given credit for showing a reaction against materialism.

===General Strike, 1926===

In May 1926 a general strike was called by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in an attempt to force the government to do something to prevent wage cuts and ameliorate worsening conditions for British coal miners. Some 2.5 million workers struck from 3 to 12 May, paralysing transport and industry. Davidson sought to play a conciliatory role; the historian G. I. T. Machin calls his intervention &quot;probably the most celebrated actions of his twenty-five years as Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;. Davidson first spoke about the strike on 5 May, addressing the Lords. He expressed disapproval of the strike but called on the Government to act to end the industrial bitterness. Two days later he convened an interdenominational group of church leaders and they drew up an appeal for a negotiated settlement. They called for the resumption of talks in a spirit of cooperation, with three tenets: the TUC should call off the general strike, the government should agree to subsidise the coal industry for a short time, and the mine owners should withdraw the disputed wage terms. Davidson wished to make the appeal known to the whole country by making a radio broadcast, but John Reith, the general manager of the BBC, refused to allow it, fearing reprisals from the government.

The initiative was only partly successful – though the strike was called off, the miners&#x27; grievances were not remedied – but the joint action by Davidson and the other religious leaders was a further step in the direction of unity. One of the nonconformist clerics told Davidson, &quot;For the first time in my life it has been possible to feel that the Christian forces in this country were united and courageous, and for that we have to thank your leadership. A new sense of unity has been given to us.&quot;

===Revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;===

The historian Matthew Grimley describes the prayer-book controversy of 1927–28 as &quot;the last great parliamentary battle over Church and state&quot;. Davidson – like his Tudor predecessor Thomas Cranmer, according to &quot;The Times&quot; – had &quot;immense and perhaps excessive faith in a new Prayer-book as a means of composing differences and restoring discipline within the Church&quot;. He also considered that a modern Prayer-book would enrich Anglican services and make them relevant to 20th-century needs unforeseen when Cranmer and his colleagues wrote the original version in the 16th century. Work had been going on under his supervision since 1906, and in 1927 a version was finally ready. The Church Assembly approved it, and it was put to Parliament for authorisation. The House of Lords agreed it by an unexpectedly large majority of 241 votes. The measure then went before the House of Commons, where it was introduced by William Bridgeman, who made a listless speech that did not impress MPs. Opposing, William Joynson-Hicks spoke vehemently, maintaining that the new Prayer-book opened the door to Romish practices. Davidson privately wrote of Bridgeman&#x27;s speech, &quot;He absolutely muffed it. It was a poor speech with no knowledge and no fire&quot;; Bell calls Joynson-Hicks&#x27;s speech &quot;flashy&quot; but &quot;abundantly successful&quot;. The Commons rejected the bill by 238 votes to 205. The MP Austen Chamberlain described Davidson as &quot;a tragically pathetic figure as he left ... after the result&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; said:

A second attempt the following year was voted down in the Commons on 14 June 1928. After that defeat Davidson told the Church Assembly:

This statement had the unanimous approval of the bishops. Some of Davidson&#x27;s colleagues felt that Parliament&#x27;s rejection of the Prayer-book would have grave consequences. William Temple, his successor-but-one at Canterbury, wrote that &quot;some sort of disestablishment is (I suppose) the necessary result&quot;; Henson, previously a strong supporter of establishment, now began to campaign against it. The historian Adrian Hastings writes that &quot;by adroitness of manoeuvre and delay&quot; Davidson led his fellow bishops away from such a drastic outcome.

===Retirement===
In June 1928 Davidson announced his retirement, to take effect on 12 November. He had served as Archbishop of Canterbury for longer than anyone since the Reformation. He was the first holder of the post to retire, and to deal with this unprecedented event the King appointed a four-man commission to accept Davidson&#x27;s formal resignation. On his retirement he was created Baron Davidson of Lambeth, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 14 November by Lord Harris and Lord Stamfordham. After leaving Lambeth Palace, Davidson moved to a house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. He died there on 25 May 1930, aged 82. The Dean of Westminster offered interment in Westminster Abbey, but Davidson had made it known that he hoped to be buried at Canterbury, and his wishes were followed. He was buried on 30 May in the cloister of Canterbury Cathedral, opposite the Chapter House. His widow died in June 1936, and was buried with him.

==Honours==
Davidson&#x27;s honours and appointments included: Prelate of the Order of the Garter (1895–1903); Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (1902); Privy Counsellor (1903); Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (1904); Royal Victorian Chain (1911); Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Saviour (Greece, 1918); Grand Cordon de l&#x27;Ordre de la Couronne (Belgium, 1919); Order of Saint Sava, First Class (Serbia, 1919); and Freeman of the City of London (1928).

==Reputation==
Davidson commented to a friend in 1928, &quot;If I was describing myself I should say I was a funny old fellow of quite mediocre, second-rate gifts and a certain amount of common sense – but that I had tried to do my best; I have tried – and I have tried to stick to my duty; but that is really all there is about it.&quot; Historians have rated him more highly, although in a 2017 study, Michael Hughes comments that Davidson has &quot;largely slipped from public memory, and perhaps even from that of the Church&quot;, his reputation eclipsed by successors such as William Temple or Michael Ramsey whose public profiles were considerably higher. Hastings calls him &quot;perhaps the most influential of churchmen&quot;, because he was &quot;a man of remarkable balance of judgment, intellectual humility, sense of responsibility and capacity for work ... His great sense of public moral responsibility gave him an influence and a position which were remarkable&quot;. The historian Keith Robbins observes that Davidson &quot;did not attempt to resolve differences of outlook and doctrine at an intellectual level. The Church of England had always contained many mansions and it was his task to prevent the sinking of this particular bark of Christ by one faction or another. He was, on the whole, remarkably successful in a sober, uninspiring way&quot;. In a 1966 study of the Church of England, Roger Lloyd writes:

Bell&#x27;s conclusion is that Davidson &quot;immensely increased the influence of the Anglican communion in Christendom, and he saw the Church of England taking far more of a world view than it had taken previously&quot;. Bell adds:

<doc id="707523" wikidata="Q7694481" url="?curid=707523" title="Teenoso">
<text>Teenoso (7 April 1980 – 4 October 1999) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. After showing moderate form as a two-year-old, he improved in the spring of 1983 to win the Group Three Lingfield Derby Trial and the Epsom Derby, giving Lester Piggott a record ninth win in the Classic race. Teenoso was beaten in his two remaining races that year but showed good form as a four-year-old, winning the Ormonde Stakes, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and, on his final appearance, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He proved to be a disappointment at stud.

==Background==
Teenoso was a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred in Kentucky by Ralph &quot;Budgie&quot; Moller and his brother, Eric, who owned the colt during his racing career. He was described as a bay when racing, but when standing at stud he was described as being &quot;dark bay or brown&quot;. Teenoso was the best horse sired by Youth, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club Washington, D.C. International in 1976. His dam, Furioso, who finished second in the 1974 Epsom Oaks, also produced the racemare Topsy, who finished second in the 1000 Guineas and won both the Sun Chariot Stakes and the Prix d&#x27;Astarte in 1979. Furioso and Teenoso were two of many successful racehorses descended from the Mollers&#x27; broodmare Horama. Others included Lacquer (Irish 1,000 Guineas, Cambridgeshire Handicap), Favoletta (Irish 1000 Guineas), Sovereign (Coronation Stakes) and Violetta (Cambridgeshire).

Teenoso was sent into training with Harry Wragg at his Abington Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk.

==Racing career==

===1982: two-year-old season===
Teenoso showed little worthwhile form as a two-year-old in 1982. He finished unplaced on his debut over six furlongs at Newmarket in August and was unplaced again over seven furlongs at Doncaster a month later. Teenoso produced a slightly better effort on his final appearance, when he finished fourth on soft ground at Newmarket. The colt ended the season with earnings of £262. At the end of the year, Harry Wragg retired from training, and his stable was taken over by his son Geoff Wragg.

===1983: three-year-old season===
On Teenoso&#x27;s first appearance as a three-year-old, he finished second in a ten-furlong maiden race at Haydock Park. The first sign of Teenoso&#x27;s potential came eleven days later at Newmarket Racecourse, when he contested a maiden race over one and a half miles on heavy ground. The colt took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away from his opponents to win easily by eight lengths. The spring of 1983 was unusually cold and wet, leaving many horses struggling to reach peak fitness, while others were unable to cope with the unusually soft, muddy conditions. The continuing wet weather forced the abandonment of several trial races, including the Chester Vase (an intended target for Teenoso) and few of the previous year&#x27;s leading two-year-olds (including Diesis Dunbeath and Gorytus) showed any worthwhile form. Teenoso&#x27;s improving form and proven ability on heavy ground saw him made third favourite for the Lingfield Derby Trial in May. He took the lead five furlongs from the finish and stayed on well to win by three lengths from Shearwalk.

When Lester Piggott, who had won the race eight times previously, elected to ride Teenoso in the Derby, the colt was strongly supported in the betting and started 9/2 favourite in a field of twenty-one runners. Racing on the heaviest ground seen at Epsom for many years, Teenoso was among the leaders from the start. Piggott sent the colt into the lead early in the straight and he was never in any apparent danger, winning by three lengths from the Irish-trained Carlingford Castle. The winning time of 2:49.07 was the slowest of the 20th century.

The Irish Derby at the Curragh three and a half weeks later saw a meeting between Teenoso and the Prix du Jockey Club winner Caerleon. In contrast to Epsom, the ground in Ireland was unusually firm and Teenoso appeared to be unsuited to the conditions as he finished third, beaten by Shareef Dancer, who won impressively, and Caerleon. Teenoso was then trained for the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. In his trial race, the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August, he ran disappointingly, finishing third to Seymour Hicks and Dazari. He returned from the race with an injury originally believed to be a stress fracture of the left hind leg. It seemed that Teenoso&#x27;s injury would end his career, but subsequent examinations revealed it to be less serious than first feared and he was able to return to training in late autumn.

===1984: four-year-old season===
Teenoso made his four-year-old debut in the Group Three John Porter Stakes at Newbury in April. He started favourite, but in his first run for eight months he was beaten into third place behind Gay Lemur and Dazari, both of whom were receiving weight from the Derby winner. In May Teenoso, accompanied by his pacemaker Mill Plantation, was sent to Chester for the Group Three Ormonde Stakes. Teenoso took the lead three furlongs from the finish and won comfortably by a length and a half from Khairpour. His success made him the first Derby winner to win as a four-year-old since Snow Knight in 1975 and the first to win in Europe since Roberto won the 1973 Coronation Cup.

In his next race, Teenoso returned to Group One level for the first time since the 1983 Irish Derby as he was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Piggott positioned Teenoso in fourth place before taking the lead in the straight. Teenoso went two lengths clear of his opponents and held the late challenge of the outsider Fly Me to win by a neck. Shortly before the race Teenoso had thrown his head back, striking Piggott in the face, and the jockey rode the race bleeding heavily from a cut over his right eye. The success was gained on fast ground, contradicting the prevailing opinion that Teenoso needed soft conditions to show his best form.

The ground was also firm at Ascot Racecourse in late July, when Teenoso started at odds of 13/2 against twelve opponents in Britain&#x27;s most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The race attracted a strong field including the 1983 winner Time Charter (who started favourite), Darshaan, Sun Princess, Tolomeo and Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Piggott sent Teenoso into the lead from the start and set a strong gallop alongside His Honour, who was in the race to set the pace for Sun Princess. Teenoso turned into the straight with a half length lead and then broke clear of his opponents to establish a clear advantage. Sadler&#x27;s Wells emerged as his only serious challenger and reduced the margin to a length entering the final furlong, but Teenoso pulled away again to win by two and a half lengths. The winning time of 2:27.95 was the second fastest in the race&#x27;s history.

Teenoso was then aimed at the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. He was the 9/4 favourite in the ante-post betting lists when he suffered a slight injury to his right foreleg three days before the race. He was withdrawn from the race on veterinary advice and retired to stud.

==Assessment and honours==
The independent Timeform organisation gave Teenoso a rating of 132 in 1983, and 135 in 1984. In the latter year Timeform named the best middle-distance horse of the year. In the official International Classification for 1984, Teenoso was rated the best European older horse and the second best horse of any age behind El Gran Senor. In the voting for the British Horse of the Year award, conducted by the Racegoers&#x27; Club, he was beaten by seventeen votes to six by the two-year-old Provideo.

In their book &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Teenoso a &quot;superior&quot; winner of the Derby.

==Retirement==
Teenoso began his stud career at the Highclere Stud but struggled to attract high-quality mares and was not considered a success as a stallion. The best of his progeny was probably Young Buster, who won seven races including the Group Three September Stakes. Other successful flat racers included Carlton (Hansa-Preis) and Starlet (Team Trophy der Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken). Teenoso was later moved to the Shade Oak Stud in Shropshire and then to the Pitts Farm Stud at Sherborne in Dorset. Towards the end of his stud career he was standing at a fee of £1,000 and was mainly being used as a National Hunt stallion. The best of his steeplechase performers were Young Spartacus (Mildmay of Flete Handicap Chase, Racing Post Chase) and Horus (Vodafone Gold Cup).

In autumn 1999, Teenoso developed thrombosis and was euthanized on October 4 at Pitts Farm Stud.

<doc id="707528" wikidata="Q1515939" url="?curid=707528" title="The Glorious Burden">
<text>The Glorious Burden is the seventh studio album by the American power metal band Iced Earth. It is a concept album, which explores various moments in military history, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolutionary War, and Waterloo. It also pays tribute to world events such as World War I, the World Trade Center attacks and the ravages of Attila the Hun. See the track list for links to the historical context of the songs.

The album includes a trilogy entitled &quot;Gettysburg (1863)&quot;. Each of the three songs represents one day in the Battle of Gettysburg, the largest battle ever conducted in the Western Hemisphere and considered the turning point in the American Civil War.

This album features the debut of lead singer Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, formerly of Judas Priest. Owens, who at that time was still in Judas Priest, was asked to do the vocals as a side project. However, he joined the band full-time after Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford. The album was first recorded with Matt Barlow on vocals, but band leader Jon Schaffer was not satisfied with his performance. Due to the events of September 11, Barlow became more interested in law enforcement than the music business, and according to Schaffer &quot;Matt&#x27;s heart was not in it and it showed in his performance.&quot; As a result, Matt left the band and the album was shelved until a new vocalist could be found. However, some of Barlow&#x27;s initial recordings remain on the record as backing vocals, and he is credited with co-writing two songs.

This record is the only Iced Earth album to feature Ralph Santolla on lead guitars. This was the last studio album for bassist James MacDonough and drummer Richard Christy.

The album was released in three different formats: a limited edition two-disc version in digipak format, and single-disc American and European versions. See the track list for the differences.

&quot;The Reckoning (Don&#x27;t Tread on Me)&quot;, &quot;Declaration Day&quot;, and the acoustic version of &quot;When the Eagle Cries (Unplugged)&quot; were all released as music videos.

<text>In Old Norse poetry and later Icelandic poetry, a lausavísa (pl. lausavísur) is a single stanza composition, or a set of stanzas unconnected by narrative or thematic continuity.

Lausavísur are often introduced in the text of sagas with the phrase &quot;þá kvað&quot; (then said).

<text>In medieval literature, the ichneumon or echinemon was the enemy of the dragon. When it sees a dragon, the ichneumon covers itself with mud, and closing its nostrils with its tail, attacks and kills the dragon. The ichneumon was also considered by some to be the enemy of the crocodile and the asp, and attack them in the same way. The name was used for the &quot;pharaoh&#x27;s rat&quot;, mongoose, or Egyptian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;), which attacks snakes; it can also mean &quot;otter&quot;. The ichneumon is shaped similarly to a ferret, although much slimmer in its shape, and the head is elongated. Also, it is an animal that can move swiftly and is able to jump a couple of yards with a single leap. 

==Etymology==
Ichneumon () means &quot;tracker&quot; in Greek. Cockatrice, a name for another mythical beast, derives from &quot;calcatrix&quot;, a Latin translation of &quot;trample&quot; or &quot;(feminine)tread on&quot;. The Ichneumon was one of the few who could look at a cockatrice without turning to stone.

==Primary sources==
* Pliny the Elder [1st century CE] (Natural History, Book 8, 88): &quot;The ichneumon is known for its willingness to fight to the death with the snake. To do this, it first covers itself with several coats of mud, drying each coat in the sun to form a kind of armor. When ready it attacks, turning away from the blows it receives until it sees an opportunity, then with its head held sideways it goes for its enemy&#x27;s throat. The ichneumon also attacks the crocodile in a similar manner.&quot;
*Strabo [1st century CE] (Geography, Book 17, edited by H.C. Hamilton, W. Falconer): &quot;The ichneumon [is] most destructive both to crocodiles and asps. The ichneumons destroy not only the eggs of the latter, but the animals themselves. The ichneumons are protected by a covering of mud, in which they roll, and then dry themselves in the sun. They then seize the asps by the head or tail, and dragging them into the river, so kill them. They lie in wait for the crocodiles, when the latter are basking in the sun with their mouths open; they then drop into their jaws, and eating through their intestines and belly, issue out of the dead body.&quot;
* Isidore of Seville [7th century CE] (Etymologies, Book 12, 2:37): &quot;That which is produced from the smell of this beast is both healthful and poisonous in food.&quot;
* Leonardo da Vinci [16th century CE] (&quot;The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci&quot; edited by Jean Paul Richter): &quot;This animal is the mortal enemy of the asp. It is a native of Egypt and when it sees an asp near its place, it runs at once to the bed or mud of the Nile and with this makes itself muddy all over, then it dries itself in the sun, smears itself again with mud, and thus, drying one after the other, it makes itself three or four coatings like a coat of mail. Then it attacks the asp, and fights well with him, so that, taking its time it catches him in the throat and destroys him.&quot;
* Nemesianus, in the introduction to the Cynegetica (a poem about hunting), refers to hunting the Ichneumon on river banks among rushes (line 54). The poem is fragmentary and any longer passage describing such hunt has been lost.
* In 18th-century English poet Christopher Smart&#x27;s &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, the poet praises his cat, Jeoffry, &quot;For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.&quot;
* In The Wizard of Zao by Lin Carter 1978, the Wizard, Oolb Votz, defeats – and destroys – his opponent Plopp the goblin shaman by changing into one.

<text>The village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), also known as the spotted-backed weaver or black-headed weaver (the latter leading to easy confusion with &quot;P. melanocephalus&quot;), is a bird species in the family Ploceidae found in much of sub-Saharan Africa. It has also been introduced to Portugal and Venezuela as well as to the islands of Hispaniola, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Mauritius and Réunion.

This often abundant species occurs in a wide range of open or semi-open habitats, including woodlands and human habitation, and frequently forms large noisy colonies in towns, villages, and hotel grounds. This weaver builds a large coarsely woven nest made of grass and leaf strips with a downward-facing entrance, which is suspended from a branch in a tree. Two or three eggs are laid. Village weavers are colonial breeders, so many nests may hang from one tree.

Village weavers feed principally on seeds and grain, and can be a crop pest, but readily take insects, especially when feeding young, which partially redresses the damage to agriculture. The calls of this bird include harsh buzzes and chattering.

== Taxonomy and systematics== 
Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller provided the first scientific name, &quot;Oriolus cucullatus&quot;, in his 1776 translation in German of the famous &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, written by Carl Linnaeus. The classification provided by Statius Muller was based on a description by Buffon, who in turn made use of work by Mathurin Jacques Brisson. Brisson was the first to publish a black-and-white etching of the bird in 1760. The first colored figure was made by François-Nicolas Martinet in a book titled by Edme-Louis Daubenton, that was published in 1783. The specimen described by Brisson was collected in Senegal between 1748 and 1754 by Michel Adanson, who sent it to René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur in France. Latham eventually gave the scientific name &quot;Oriolus textor&quot; in 1790. Based on &quot;Oriolus textor&quot;, Johann Friedrich Gmelin erected in 1825 a new genus he named &quot;Textor&quot;. This name has priority over the use of the genus name in the combination &quot;Textor alecto&quot; that Temminck described in 1828, and which is a synonym for the first name of the white-billed buffalo-weaver, &quot;Coccothraustes albirostris&quot;, as named by Vieillot in 1817, and now assigned to the genus &quot;Bubalornis&quot;. The species epithet &quot;cucullatus&quot; is Latin and means &quot;hooded&quot;.

In 1789, Johann Friedrich Gmelin distinguished &quot;Loxia abyssinica&quot;, which was later recognised as a subspecies of the village weaver and for which the new combination &quot;P. c. abyssinicus&quot; was created. Louis Pierre Vieillot described a slightly different bird that he called subspecies &quot;collaris&quot; in 1819. Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1831 distinguished subspecies &quot;spilonotus&quot;.

===Etymology===
The first English name, &quot;weever oriole&quot; was given by John Latham, an early British ornithologist, whose work was often cited by Linnaeus. &quot;Village weaver&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee. Other English names are &quot;black-headed weaver&quot;, &quot;Layard&#x27;s black-headed weaver&quot;, &quot;black-hooded weaver&quot;, &quot;mottled-backed weaver&quot;, &quot;mottled weaver&quot;, &quot;spotted-backed weaver&quot;, &quot;spot-backed weaver&quot;, and &quot;V-marked weaver&quot;. 

===Subspecies===
Eight subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;P. c. cucullatus&quot; – : The nominate subspecies occurs from Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia to southern Chad and Cameroon. It also can be found on Bioko. Also introduced to Hispaniola.
* &quot;P. c. abyssinicus&quot; – : Found in northern Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia
* &quot;P. c. bohndorffi&quot; – : Found in southern Sudan, northern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, western Kenya and north-western Tanzania
* &quot;P. c. collaris&quot; (mottled weaver) – : Found in Gabon, western Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola
* &quot;P. c. graueri&quot; – : Found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and western Tanzania
* &quot;P. c. frobenii&quot; – : Found in southern and south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
* &quot;P. c. nigriceps&quot; (Layard&#x27;s weaver) – : Found from southern Somalia and eastern Kenya through eastern and southern Tanzania to south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Angola and north-eastern Namibia, western Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia and central Mozambique. It also occurs on São Tomé where it was probably introduced.
* &quot;P. c. spilonotus&quot; (spotted-backed weaver) – :, Found in south-eastern Botswana, eastern South Africa and southern Mozambique. Also introduced to Mauritius, Réunion, and Venezuela.

==Description==
The village weaver is a stocky, bird with a strong conical bill and dark reddish eyes. In the northern part of its range, the breeding male has a black head edged by chestnut (typically most distinct on the nape and chest). Towards the southern part of its range, the amount of black and chestnut diminish, and the breeding males of the southernmost subspecies only have a black face and throat, while the nape and crown are yellow. In all subspecies, the breeding male has a black bill, black and yellow upperparts and wings, and yellow underparts.

The nonbreeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upperparts and whitish underparts. The wings remain yellow and black. The adult female has streaked olive upperparts, yellow and black wings, and pale yellow underparts. Young birds are like the female, but browner on the back.

== Distribution and habitat==
The village weaver is among the more common weaver species, and is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, but is absent from the arid regions in the southwest and northeast. It has been introduced to islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean, where it has adapted well to the climates similar to its original range.

== Behavior and ecology==
Village weavers forage and roost in large groups, often with other weaver species. In some areas, they move periodically along fixed routes. The birds look for food on the ground, but also look up to search vegetation and trees. Village weavers nest in colonies and are very active during the breeding season. Birds fly in and leave again constantly, making significant noise. Colonies can contain as many as 150 nests, but eight to a hundred nests in a single tree are usual.

A village weaver&#x27;s nest is long and high. The entrance is mostly extended into a tube of long. The male weaves the structure of the nest using long strips of leaf that he has torn from palms or large grass species such as &quot;Arundo donax&quot;. The nest is roofed, ovoid or kidney-shaped, internally consisting of a nesting chamber that is separated by a ground sill from an antechamber, that has the entrance of the entire nest at the bottom. On the inside, the ceiling is made of strips of grass or other leaves, which are simply inserted instead of woven in. The floor on the inside is lined by short, thatched strips of palm, grass blades or heads, and feathers. The nest requires about 300 long strips of leaf, which the male tears off and transports one by one. The male gathers building material throughout the building process, during which he works with his feet in exactly the same position, and maintaining the same orientation. He starts by creating the attachment by weaving around mostly two hanging branches just below a fork, a foot on both of them, which he includes in a ring he constructs by weaving in the plain of the branches at the edge of his reach. He than extends the high end of the ring in front of its head, gradually working towards his feet creating a half-globe that is the nesting chamber. The male continues by constructing the roof of the antechamber, working over his head. This is followed by lining the ceiling, and constructing the entrance tube, hanging upside-down, but still with his feet at the same spots. The weaving technique consists of seizing a strip of near the end and double the strip back on itself. Next he pokes the end with a vibrating movement in between his previous work until it sticks. He then releases it, moves his head to the other side of the nest wall, seizes the strip again, and pokes it in somewhere. He keeps repeating this, regularly reversing the direction in which he weaves the strip, poking and pulling the strip through holes until the entire length is used. The female collects material, too, but she occupies herself only with the lining of the nesting cup.

<doc id="707555" wikidata="Q1753574" url="?curid=707555" title="Horror Show (album)">
<text>Horror Show is the sixth studio album from the American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released June 26, 2001. It is a concept album based on classic monsters and horror-movie icons, including Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Phantom. It was the first Iced Earth album to feature drummer Richard Christy, and the only album to feature Steve Di Giorgio on bass, though he did not tour with the band. &quot;Horror Show&quot; is usually considered Iced Earth&#x27;s only straightforward power metal release, as little of the thrash metal influence from the band&#x27;s earlier works is present. This album also featured more prominent usage of Matt Barlow&#x27;s multi-layered vocals as a center point for the songs.

There was a special limited-edition two-disc set. The second disc included the instrumental track, &quot;Transylvania&quot;, an Iron Maiden cover, along with an interview with bandleader/rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer. There is also a single-disc version with &quot;Transylvania&quot;, but without the interview. The song &quot;Dracula&quot; includes the line &quot;the blood is the life&quot;, a quote from Deuteronomy 12:23. However, it is likely lifted from the 1992 version of &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; which also features the line. As in &quot;Dracula&quot;, many of the lyrics are lifted straight from the movies they were inspired by. Unlike other releases, it features much writing from Matt Barlow.

By the end of the song &quot;Damien&quot; there is a section where Jon&#x27;s reversed voice repeats the message that is also in the middle, silent section of the song. So, if the song is played backwards, the true message can be heard. This kind of reversed voice was also done by Iron Maiden in the beginning of their song &quot;Still Life&quot; of their fourth studio album &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;.

== Track listing ==
All lyrics and music written by Jon Schaffer, except where noted.

*Track 6 (&quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;)&#x27;s official title misspells the name of the character as &quot;Jeckyl&quot;.

===Limited edition===
The initial pressing was presented in a standard two-disc jewel case with no reference to the tracks on the bonus disc (nor the disc itself) except for a sticker on the front. Because &quot;Transylvania&quot; is moved out of the track list, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Child&quot; has its full ending, increasing its length.

<text>Galileo Academy of Science and Technology, formerly known as Galileo High School, is a public high school located between the Russian Hill and Marina District neighborhoods of San Francisco, California. The school is a part of the San Francisco Unified School District.

==About Galileo==
Galileo Academy is located in the historic north end of San Francisco, and was originally built in 1921. As of May 2015, Galileo has more than 150 faculty and staff members and serves more than 1,800 students. It is one of two Bay Area schools with an observatory. The observatory at Galileo is not in use at this time. Plans for restoration are in progress. Galileo received the 2005 California Distinguished School Award along with the 2005 CTE Award - one of the very few schools that were awarded this.

The lion is the official mascot of Galileo. In sports and other inter-school activities the team members are known as the Galileo Lions. The official school colors are purple and orange. Galileo has an internal television network, G-House TV, which is broadcast by students of the Media Arts Pathway. The Media Arts Pathway (MAP) works on all media-related works while AoIT concentrates on computer science related works. The school motto is &quot;Eppure si muove&quot; (Italian: And yet it moves). As the story goes, Galileo Galilei was told to deny his scientific findings that the earth moved, or be punished - so he did as he was ordered. But on his way out he mumbled to himself, &quot;And yet it moves.&quot;

==History==
On December 10, 1920, Major Joseph P. Nourse, who had been actively engaged in educational work in the city for many years, became the first principal of Galileo High School. Throughout the summer, carpenters were busy converting the Red Cross Building, located on Fulton Street near the Civic Center. On August 1, 1921, Galileo High School welcomed its student body into the remodeled facilities. The ceremony of &quot;breaking ground&quot; for the new building was on November 4, 1921, and the dedication of the Van Ness Building on March 30, 1924. At the same time, plans were underway for a new wing which would double the school&#x27;s capacity.

In the 1920s, the Galileo High School building was considered an outstanding example of modern architecture. Planned with the intention of housing one of the best educational institutions in the country, it was equipped to offer the highest type of academic curriculum in addition to training in commercial and technical branches.

During the 1970s, Galileo went through an extensive refit where most, if not all, student facilities were moved across the street onto Fort Mason. Before this, there were rumors that the Galileo campus would be permanently moved onto the Fort Mason site. Though the student population, then, did not indicate whether the move and larger facilities would be justified, the land that Galileo sits on was quite valuable, which could have made the move plausible.

Since the 1995-96 school year, Galileo has transformed itself to the Galileo Academy of Science and Technology. The new program provides students with career pathways and academies. These include the Galileo Health Academy, the Academy of Information Technology (AoIT), Biotechnology Pathway and the Environmental Science Pathway. In 2006-2007, the Publications Pathway was introduced and, in 2007-2008, the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism (AoHT) and Digital Photography Pathway.

On September 25, 2007, while some construction workers were digging the courtyard, they found a time capsule which was thought to be lost forever by the Class of 1982. It was uncovered that day, but was filled with water, as well as a yearbook, a frisbee, a Rubik&#x27;s Cube and a Mighty Lion T-shirt. It was buried shortly after the class of &#x27;82 graduated, but, in 1997, a search for the time capsule over every square foot of the courtyard turned up nothing. The time capsule is now stored in one of the closets in the building.

On October 31, 2007, the courtyard partially reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the ASB officers, followed by a celebration and a contest. The courtyard did not fully open until November, as there was still more maintenance work required.

On August 21, 2024, during 12:35 p.m., a physical altercation involving two people escalated into one student being wounded by gunfire. A student was shot once in the shoulder adjacent to the school&#x27;s campus, close to where the athletic fields are. As of Sep. 2024, the suspect has not been identified or arrested; at least one witness said the suspect ran away wearing a mask. According to the victim&#x27;s mother, he was pressured to join the alleged suspect&#x27;s gang and refused.

==Academies and pathways==
Students in their sophomore, junior and senior years can participate in one of the five career pathways or academies. In small learning communities, students choose to take a particular elective class that is paired with one or two core academic classes. Biotechnology is paired with English; Health with English; AOIT with English and Social Studies; and AOHT with Math. In addition to the academies and pathways, students can choose to be in the Chinese Immersion program or in the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program. Both programs are integrated into their school day, and are 4-year long programs.

==Location==
The school is located at 1150 Francisco Street, San Francisco, CA.

Galileo is located in far northern San Francisco, in the Russian Hill neighbourhood near Fort Mason.

Muni bus service is plentiful in the vicinity, with direct access to six bus routes, and various others in the area. Less than half of the students reside near the school, but school buses and special buses on the 28-19th Avenue are provided by the Municipal Railway. Special bus service exclusively serves students in SFUSD, and only drops off passengers. The 19-Polk, 30-Stockton, and 49-Van Ness/Mission also serve nearby, but have no special runs.

==Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program==
The Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps battalion at Galileo is an Honor Unit with Distinction, the highest designation a unit may have. Its afterschool teams are very competitive, often highly placed in the annual fall and spring competitions. Fall teams consist of the Guidon, Squad Drill, Color Guard and Drill Platoon while Spring teams include Drum Corps, Silent Drill Team and Exhibition Drill Team. Other competitions occur during the last week of school at Camp Parks. This consists of cadet challenge and various other sporting events.

The program was disbanded in 2018, though reinstated the following school year under new leadership due to outcry and support for the program.

==American football==
Largely due its alumnus O. J. Simpson, Galileo was well known for its American football team.

The football field that dominates the second block of Galileo was formerly named in honor of O. J. Simpson. However, after Simpson&#x27;s trial for murder in 1995, the football field was renamed George White Field. The two twin apartment buildings that face the northern side of the football field are the Fontana buildings, which were supposedly built to echo and magnify the sounds of the football games.

Galileo&#x27;s football team has had three undefeated seasons throughout the school&#x27;s history. In 1988, the Lions defeated McAteer High School becoming the first football team in San Francisco history to go 12–0. The second undefeated season was in 1990 and the third was in 2002 when the Lions defeated the Washington Eagles.

From the end of the 2006 season through the first game of the 2009 season, Galileo had an 18-game losing streak, going winless in both 2007 (0–7) and 2008 (0–9). After losing the first game of the 2009 season, the Lions won 9 out of their final 11 games, punctuated by a 35–0 win over the Lincoln High School Mustangs in the San Francisco AAA Turkey Bowl, capturing their 16th city championship. Lincoln had won 4 consecutive AAA championships in a row prior to the 2009 season from 2005-2008. It was Galileo&#x27;s 16th San Francisco AAA championship overall.

Four years later in 2013, the Lions (led by quarterback Kyle Nelson and running back Ronzel Fox) prevailed once again over the Lincoln High Mustangs in the AAA-Turkey Bowl by a score of 34–30. It was Galileo&#x27;s record 17th city championship.

In 2017, Galileo won the school&#x27;s 18th city championship and advanced to the state playoffs. The Lions beat the Rio Vista High Rams in the Northern California championship and the Vincent Memorial Scots in the State championship. It was the first state football championship for any San Francisco AAA school.

==Reputation==
Galileo previously had a bad reputation for low test scores and criminal events occurring in school, but in more recent years it has become one of the most improved schools in San Francisco (see Academic Performance Index below). Since the installation of surveillance cameras in 2005, criminal acts at Galileo have declined as a serious issue. Math scores remain one of Galileo&#x27;s best academic strengths.

In 2008, Gerald Courtney, the Assistant Principal at the time, was charged in a prostitution ring. Courtney was accused of helping operate two brothels in San Jose. No minors, school officials or students from the San Francisco Unified School District were involved in the operation, police said. Police also believe Courtney posted advertisements for the prostitution business on online forums.

&quot;The Galileo Observer&quot; is the quarterly newsletter for the alumni.

==Galileo Songs==
&quot;Hail, Galileo, Hail&quot; is the Hymn of Galileo Academy of Science &amp; Technology.

Other songs include The Galileo Fight Song, The Big G, and The Lion&#x27;s Whisper. They are usually performed by the Galileo Cheerleaders or &quot;Lioness&quot;.
The songs are also performed at Song and Yell, an annual rally that takes place near the beginning of each school year.

<text>Hood Canal is a fjord-like body of water that lies west of Admiralty Inlet in Washington state that many people consider to be the western lobe and one of the four main basins of Puget Sound. It is one of the minor bodies of water that constitute the Salish Sea. Maximum depth is 600 ft. Hood Canal is not a canal in the sense of an artificial waterway—it is a natural feature.

==Geography==
Hood Canal is long and narrow with an average width of and a mean depth of . It has of shoreline and of tideland. Its surface area is and it contains a volume of water totaling . Hood Canal extends for about southwest from the entrance between Foulweather Bluff and Tala Point to Union, where it turns sharply to the northeast, a stretch called The Great Bend. It continues for about to Belfair, where it ends in a shallow tideland called .

Along its entire length, Hood Canal separates the Kitsap Peninsula from the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor Annex, is located on the eastern shore of Hood Canal near the town of Silverdale. Hood Canal has several internal bays, the largest of which is . Most of Dabob Bay is a Naval Restricted Area, and is used by the submarines stationed at the Bangor Base. Quilcene Bay is an inlet extending northwest from Dabob Bay. Near the north end of Hood Canal is Port Gamble, a bay and a town of the same name.

Several rivers flow into Hood Canal, mostly from the Olympic Peninsula, including the Skokomish River, Hamma Hamma River, Duckabush River, Dosewallips River, and Big Quilcene River. Small rivers emptying into Hood Canal from the Kitsap Peninsula include the Union River, Tahuya River, and Dewatto River.

==Geology==
Hood Canal and the rest of Puget Sound were created about 13,000 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene, by the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.

==Fauna==

Hood Canal has a population of salmon that return annually to spawn in local rivers; in 2024, local volunteers counted over 12,500 salmon in the Hood Canal drainage basin after the completion of several restoration projects. Killer whales have been spotted occasionally in Hood Canal, including members of the endangered southern resident population. In 2021, a pod spent 30 days in Hood Canal and reached as far as Belfair. The U.S. Navy began deployment of trained dolphins in Hood Canal in 2010 to patrol the areas around its submarine base at Bangor.

==History==

Hood Canal was named by the Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver on May 13, 1792, in honor of Admiral Lord Samuel Hood of that navy. Vancouver used the name &quot;Hood&#x27;s Channel&quot; in his journal, but wrote &quot;Hood&#x27;s Canal&quot; on his charts. The United States Board on Geographic Names decided on &quot;Hood Canal&quot; as its official name in 1932.

==Roads and bridges==
U.S. Route 101 runs along the west shore of Hood Canal, south of Quilcene.

Hood Canal is spanned by the Hood Canal Bridge, the third longest floating bridge in the world at . According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Hood Canal Bridge is the only floating bridge in the United States constructed on saltwater, although there are others, such as Nordhordland Bridge and Bergsøysund Bridge in Norway. The Hood Canal Bridge accommodates sixteen and a half foot tides.

==Recreation==

State parks on the shores of Hood Canal including Belfair, Twanoh, Potlatch, Triton Cove, Scenic Beach, Dosewallips, and Kitsap Memorial. Prominent shoreside activities include swimming, boating, fishing and shellfish gathering.

Theler Wetlands is located at the tip of the Canal in Belfair. It provides a few miles of trails and a protected environment for marsh and estuary birds and plants.

There are many small towns located along the length of the Hood Canal, mostly on the western shore. The latter are near hiking and recreation within the Olympic National Forest and the Olympic National Park. Some of the more popular areas include Staircase Campground and Hama Hama Recreation Area and act as the gateways to miles of hiking trails through quiet, lush forests.

==Low oxygen levels==
September 2006 marked the discovery of the largest dead zone in the history of Hood Canal. The dead zone may have been caused by low oxygen levels due to algal blooms. Algal blooms occur in part because of warm weather and the slow turnover of water in the southern end of the canal, causing the build-up of nutrients from fertilizers and leaky septic systems. Organic matter, brought in by ocean water and certain trees, could additionally be contributing to the high nitrogen levels in the basin. Excess nutrients and organic matter causes a body of water to lose oxygen, through a process called eutrophication. In Hood Canal, eutrophication has led to unwanted algae blooms. Nitrogen combined with sunlight triggers algal growth. A lack of sufficient consumers has resulted in a mass overgrowth of algae in the basin. When the algae die, bacteria feed and their populations explode, robbing the water of oxygen. A state of hypoxia is created.

The fish kill may also be part of a natural 50-year cycle of oxygen levels in the canal, which has merely been influenced (but not controlled) by anthropogenic activity. Natural causes of hypoxia in Hood Canal include the timing of freshwater inflows, water layer stratification resulting from seasonal changes in surface temperature, and climate change. The oxygen level may also be partially due to a change in wind direction. The prevailing north wind generally pushes oxygenated water into the oxygen-depleted area. A sustained south wind will cut off this source of oxygen. Coastal upwelling from the Strait of Juan de Fuca bring in a surplus of nutrients into the Puget Sound, but fail to circulate oxygen through Hood Canal. Chronic hypoxia is observed year-round. This area of low-oxygen is often seen in Lynch Cove, but has been spreading towards the mouth of Hood Canal.

In May 2006, divers searching for invasive species discovered a mat of marine bacteria covering a stretch where all normal sea life was dead. The mat dissipated five months later. Jan Newton, oceanographer at the University of Washington, said it was important to note that Hood Canal has had very low oxygen for a long time. Similar mats have been found near Tacoma, Washington; San Diego, California; New York City; and New Orleans, Louisiana. Hypoxia and its detrimental effects on fish have been documented in Hood Canal since the 1970s. But hypoxia&#x27;s impacts on the area&#x27;s wildlife have been more significantly linked to growing urbanization along the coast. A recent study determined dissolved oxygen (DO) content, or oxygen saturation, of the Sound&#x27;s Main Basin to consistently stay around 5 mg/L from the 1950s up through 2005. DO concentration in Hood Canal, however, was identified to have dramatically decreased from 5–6 mg/L in the 1950s to less than 0.2 mg/L in the twenty-first century. As of 2000, the National Research Council defined hypoxia to occur at a DO level of &lt;2 mg/L—making Hood Canal&#x27;s current 0.2 mg/L composition far below life-sustaining conditions.

Hood Canal&#x27;s hypoxic state has had devastating effects on the sub-basin&#x27;s biodiversity. Valuable commercial species such as geoduck clam and Dungeness crab may be adversely affected by hypoxic conditions. Critically low oxygen levels, due to increased bacterial growth, were observed in the lower portion of Hood Canal during the summer months of 2004 and 2005. A low dissolved oxygen content in Anna&#x27;s Bay and Lynch Cove is believed to have been responsible for the corresponding decline in spot shrimp catch by Skokomish Nation fishers within the same period of time. In 2010, there was a massive fish kill in the southern part of Hood Canal. Hundreds of fish and thousands of shrimp were found washed up onto the shore. Jan Newton, a local oceanographer, concluded that the water contained less than 1 milliliter per liter of dissolved oxygen and that such a low level is extremely stressful, often lethal, to the marine life in Hood Canal. The effects of Hood Canal&#x27;s hypoxic conditions are clearly seen by the public through massive fish kills, but it is important to identify other harmful impacts resulting from a lack of oxygen in the basin. Eelgrass beds, which are nurseries for salmon and crab, have declined more in Hood Canal than any other area of the Puget Sound. Bottom dwelling rockfish have also seen a decline due to a lack of eelgrass. Other notable cases of hypoxia and its adverse effects on biodiversity include the large-scale hypoxic zone that appears in the Gulf of Mexico each summer.

The Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP), a partnership of 38 organizations, has been formed to combat the problem. This program will work with local, state, federal, and tribal government policy makers to evaluate potential corrective actions that will restore and maintain a level of dissolved oxygen that will reduce stress on marine life. The HCDOP-Integrated Assessment and Modeling study was started in 2005 to quantify marine processes and watershed loadings, assess biota-oxygen interactions, model key processes to measure drivers of oxygen, and to evaluate potential corrective actions. Government agencies, such as Puget Sound Partnership and the United States Geological Survey, have used HCDOP&#x27;s publicly available information to conduct their own assessment and modeling studies of Hood Canal. Puget Sound Partnership is a Washington state agency responsible for protecting and restoring life in the Sound. The group is required to produce a &quot;State of the Sound&quot; report every two years. As of 2009, the Sound has recently shown signs of increased stress and degradation from human activity. A noticeable drop in spawning rates has had a negative effect on the ecosystem&#x27;s biodiversity and available habitats continue to decline. But the abundance of some species, like the Chinook salmon, have advanced and limited loadings of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) to Elliott Bay has improved water quality there.

Though difficult to regulate, a majority of proposed solutions have recommended the regulation of harmful, nearby anthropogenic practices. Human development has caused the most significant damage to Hood Canal&#x27;s ecosystem. The runoff from septic tanks dumps large quantities of nitrogen into the canal following each rainfall. The best way to solve this problem is to work with the community to create state of the art sewage treatment plants or, at the very least, upgrade old and damaged septic systems to prevent leaks. Several of Puget Sound&#x27;s counties have taken it upon themselves to create detailed on-site sewage codes. Because the Hood Canal region has experienced logging, as have the majority of watersheds around Puget Sound, the surrounding forests have become heavily degraded. This has caused nitrogen-rich Alder forests to leach excess nutrients into the water. Restoring wetlands along Hood Canal and restoring native plant life with low nitrogen impacts could help ameliorate this phenomenon. Since wetlands are great filters for the environment, this could prove a very effective way of lowering the impact of nitrogen on the basin. Coastal upwellings and tides are a huge issue for Hood Canal. Because of the lack of upwelling and tides pushing in oxygen rich waters into the canal, the area&#x27;s oxygen content suffers. Unfortunately, since the Puget Sound ecosystem is so large, it would be very difficult to oxygenate deeper waters. But surface-level DO could be improved by restoring natural flows of estuaries.

==Icing over==
During a week of record-breaking cold temperatures in December 2009, parts of Hood Canal developed a thin layer of ice, thicker near the shoreline.

<doc id="707573" wikidata="Q4501412" url="?curid=707573" title="Chief Rabbi">
<text>Chief Rabbi () is a title given in several countries to the recognized religious leader of that country&#x27;s Jewish community, or to a rabbinic leader appointed by the local secular authorities. Since 1911, through a capitulation by Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, Israel has had two chief rabbis, one Ashkenazi and one Sephardi.

Cities with large Jewish communities may also have their own chief rabbis; this is especially the case in Israel but has also been past practice in major Jewish centers in Europe prior to the Holocaust. North American cities rarely have chief rabbis. One exception however is Montreal, with two—one for the Ashkenazi community, the other for the Sephardi.

Jewish law provides no scriptural or Talmudic support for the post of a &quot;chief rabbi.&quot; The office, however, is said by many to find its precedent in the religio-political authority figures of Jewish antiquity (e.g., kings, high priests, patriarchs, exilarchs and &quot;geonim&quot;). The position arose in Europe in the Middle Ages from governing authorities largely for secular administrative reasons such as collecting taxes and registering vital statistics, and for providing an intermediary between the government and the Jewish community, for example in the establishment of the Crown rabbi in several kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, the &quot;rab de la corte&quot; in the Kingdom of Castile or the &quot;arrabi mor&quot; in the Kingdom of Portugal, likely influenced by the expectations of their Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican governments and neighbors. Similarly, in the 19th century there was a &quot;Crown rabbi&quot; of the Russian Empire.

===Israel===

The position of chief rabbi () of the Land of Israel has existed for hundreds of years. During the Mandatory Period, the British recognized the chief rabbis of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, just as they recognized the Mufti of Jerusalem. The offices continued after statehood was achieved. Haredi Jewish groups (such as Edah HaChareidis) do not recognize the authority of the Chief Rabbinate. They usually have their own rabbis who do not have any connection to the state rabbinate.

Under current Israeli law, the post of Chief Rabbi exists in only four cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Beersheba). In other cities there may be one main rabbi to whom the other rabbis of that city defer, but that post is not officially the &quot;Chief Rabbi&quot;.

Many of Israel&#x27;s chief rabbis were previously chief rabbis of Israeli cities.

====Spanish and Portuguese community Hahamim/senior rabbis====
The Sephardi Jews in the United Kingdom are mainly members of independent synagogues. There is no single rabbi recognised by them as a chief rabbi. The Spanish and Portuguese community, however, consists of several synagogues, charities, a beth din and a kashruth authority. These are under the leadership of an ecclesiastical head. Historically, the individual who fills this role is recognised as a senior rabbi of Anglo Jewry, being the leader of the oldest Jewish community in the country. The Senior Rabbi was traditionally given the title, &quot;Haham,&quot; meaning &quot;wise one&quot;. Since 1918, however, only Solomon Gaon was given this title. The official title of the holder of this office is now The Senior Rabbi of the S&amp;P Sephardi Community of the United Kingdom.

* Joseph Dweck (2013–) (elected Senior Rabbi of The S&amp;P Sephardi Community, not the &quot;haham&quot;)

===United States===
A chief rabbinate never truly developed within the United States for a number of different reasons. While Jews first settled in the United States in 1654 in New York City, rabbis did not appear in the United States until the mid-nineteenth century. This lack of rabbis, coupled with the lack of official colonial or state recognition of a particular sect of Judaism as official effectively led to a form of congregationalism amongst American Jews. This did not stop others from trying to create a unified American Judaism, and in fact, some chief rabbis developed in some American cities despite lacking universal recognition amongst the Jewish communities within the cities (for examples see below). However, Jonathan Sarna argues that those two precedents, as well as the desire of many Jewish immigrants to the US to break from an Orthodox past, effectively prevented any effective Chief Rabbi in America.

<doc id="707575" wikidata="Q1336262" url="?curid=707575" title="Jacques d'Amboise (dancer)">
<text>Jacques d&#x27;Amboise (born Joseph Jacques Ahearn, July 28, 1934 – May 2, 2021) was an American ballet dancer, choreographer, and educator. He joined the New York City Ballet in 1949 and was named principal dancer in 1953, and throughout his time with the company he danced 24 roles for George Balanchine. He also made film appearances, including &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot;. He choreographed 17 ballets for the New York City Ballet and retired from performing in 1984.

D&#x27;Amboise founded the National Dance Institute in 1976 to promote dance to children. His work with the institute was featured in the documentary, &quot;He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot;, which won an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. He received the MacArthur Fellowship in 1990, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1995, and the National Medal of Arts in 1998.

== Early life and training ==
Joseph Jacques Ahearn was born on July 28, 1934, in Dedham, Massachusetts, to an Irish American father, Andrew Ahearn, and a mother of French Canadian descent, Georgette D&#x27;Amboise. He was one of four children. His father worked as a personal telegraph operator to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. The family later moved to Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York. His father became an elevator operator at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

At age seven, d&#x27;Amboise was sent to his sister&#x27;s ballet class, and within six months he entered George Balanchine&#x27;s School of American Ballet. In 1946 his mother managed to convince the family to change their surname from Ahearn to hers, d&#x27;Amboise, as &quot;it&#x27;s aristocratic, it&#x27;s French...and it&#x27;s a better name&quot;. Thus his name was legally changed to Joseph Jacques d&#x27;Amboise. The same year he started performing child roles with Ballet Society. He left high school at age fifteen when he joined the New York City Ballet.

==Career==
In 1949, 15-year-old d&#x27;Amboise was recruited to the New York City Ballet. Soon he was cast in lead roles, including the lead in Lew Christensen&#x27;s &quot;Filling Station&quot;. In 1953 he was promoted to principal dancer. Balanchine created 24 roles for him, including &quot;Western Symphony&quot; (1954), &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; (1958), &quot;Episodes&quot; (1959), &quot;Movements for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1963), &quot;Jewels&quot; (1967), &quot;Who Cares&quot; (1970), &quot;Robert Schumann&#x27;s Davidsbündlertänze&quot; (1980), as well the New York City Ballet 1957 revival of Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Apollo&quot;, in which d&#x27;Amboise danced the titular role. He also choreographed 17 ballets for the company.

Outside of the New York City Ballet, d&#x27;Amboise had also appeared in films. In 1954 he played Ephraim in Stanley Donen&#x27;s film, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, after Donen spotted d&#x27;Amboise in a performance of &quot;Filling Station&quot;. In 1956 he appeared in two films, &quot;Carousel&quot; as Starlight Carnival barker and &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;. In 1957 he performed in the Broadway musical, &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;.

In 1976 he founded the National Dance Institute to promote dance to children. At first the group only had 30 boys. As of 2021 the program had reached 2 million children. In 1978 he was named dean of dance at State University of New York at Purchase. D&#x27;Amboise was the subject of Emile Ardolino&#x27;s documentary, &quot;He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot;, which followed his works with the National Dance Institute. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1983 and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program in 1984.

He retired from the New York City Ballet in 1984, shortly before he turned 50. He later stated he decided to retire as there were few roles he could dance at that age. He then shifted his focus to the National Dance Institute. In 1986 he appeared in the Disney film, &quot;Off Beat&quot;, with his character teaching dance to New York City police.

In 1994, he co-founded the National Dance Institute New Mexico (NDI New Mexico) with Catherine Oppenheimer.

==Awards and honors==
Honors d&#x27;Amboise received include the MacArthur Fellowship in 1990, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1995, the National Medal of Arts in 1998, and the Fred and Adele Astaire Awards in 2011. He also received the Heinz Award, the New York Governor&#x27;s Award, and honorary doctorate degrees from Boston College and Montclair State University.

==Personal life==
In 1956 d&#x27;Amboise married Carolyn George, a New York City Ballet dancer and later a photographer. They had four children, including Christopher, a dancer and choreographer, and Charlotte, also a dancer and actress. Carolyn George died in 2009.

==Death==
D&#x27;Amboise died at his home in Manhattan on May 2, 2021, following complications from a stroke at the age of 86.

<doc id="707599" wikidata="Q2608244" url="?curid=707599" title="X-Men vs. Street Fighter">
<text>is a crossover fighting video game developed and published by Capcom. It is Capcom&#x27;s third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters, following &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, and is the first installment in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series. As the title suggests, the game includes characters from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise and the cast from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. Originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996, it was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and the PlayStation in 1998. The original arcade version is included in the game lineup for &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&quot;, released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2024.

&quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; features gameplay similar to &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, but incorporates dual-character selection and tag team-based combat. Each player selects two characters to compete in a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;.

The game was released to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise for maintaining the experience of the original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles. The changes were done in response to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. A sequel to the game, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, was released in 1997.

==Gameplay==

Similar to Capcom&#x27;s various &quot;Street Fighter&quot; titles, &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; is a 2D fighting game in which players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters at the beginning of a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most combined remaining health is declared the winner.

The game borrows numerous gameplay conventions from Capcom&#x27;s previous Marvel-licensed ventures, &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot; and &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, such as the &quot;Super Jump&quot;, the ability to jump higher than normal, and &quot;Aerial Rave&quot;, the ability to perform combos on the opponent while in the air. &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; also includes a meter system similar to the two aforementioned games called the &quot;Hyper Combo Gauge&quot;. As characters perform moves and receive damage, the players&#x27; Hyper Combo Gauges will gradually fill. Players can expend their meter to perform various special techniques, such as the &quot;Hyper Combo&quot;, which unleashes high amounts of damage; &quot;Variable Combination&quot;, where both characters use their Hyper Combos simultaneously; and &quot;Variable Counter&quot;, which transforms a defensive block into an offensive counterattack by tagging in the off-screen character.

===Modes===
The arcade, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation versions of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; all include Arcade Mode and Versus Mode. In Arcade Mode, the player fights several artificial intelligence-controlled teams before competing in a final battle against the boss character, Apocalypse, an antagonist from the &quot;X-Men&quot; series. In Versus Mode, two players can fight against each other locally. The PlayStation port also features Training Mode, where players can practice moves and combos against non-aggressive computer opponents, and Survival Mode, where players fight against endless waves of teams. 

==Playable characters==

&quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; features a roster of 17 playable characters. The character sprites for the &quot;X-Men&quot; characters were drawn from &quot;X-Men: Children of the Atom&quot;, with the exception of Rogue, Gambit, and Sabretooth, who had not appeared in a previous Capcom fighting game. The sprite designs themselves are based on the characters&#x27; appearances from the 1990s animated &quot;X-Men&quot; television series, complete with the original voice actors. The &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character sprites are reused from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;. Similar to his secret guest appearance in &quot;Children of the Atom&quot;, Akuma appears as a hidden character in &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;. In order to create a level playing field between the cast of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and the &quot;X-Men&quot; series&#x27; superheroes and supervillains, the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters were re-imagined with highly exaggerated versions of their special moves. For example, Ryu comes equipped with a &quot;super Hadouken&quot; that fills the entire screen.

==Development and release==
&quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; debuted in Japan in September 1996 for the CP System II arcade board, and was released worldwide later on in 1996. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn in Japan on November 27, 1997. The port was the first game announced to support the Saturn&#x27;s 4MB RAM cartridge. It utilized the cartridge peripheral, which was packaged alongside the game, to deliver an arcade-perfect conversion. Though Capcom USA said the game would eventually come out in the U.S., Sega&#x27;s decision not to manufacture the requisite 4 MB RAM cartridge in the U.S. presented a major obstacle to the game&#x27;s release there. Additionally, several major U.S. retailers announced that they would be clearing out all Saturn hardware and software inventory in the second quarter of 1998, casting doubt on whether Capcom could get &quot;X-Men Vs. Street Fighter&quot; onto retailer shelves if they went ahead with the release. Ultimately, the Saturn version was never officially released in North America. An imported version was sold at certain Electronics Boutique locations.

Capcom&#x27;s usual European publisher, Virgin Interactive, were reluctant to release any of Capcom&#x27;s Saturn games using the 4 MB cartridge due to the prohibitive costs of manufacturing the cartridge. Sega licensed the game from Capcom, intending to release it in Europe bundled with the expansion cartridge; however, these plans were eventually shelved.

At a November 6, 1996 press conference, Capcom announced that the home version of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; would be exclusive to the Saturn. Facing ongoing accusations of favoritism towards the Saturn (due to the perceived superiority of the Saturn version of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; over the PlayStation version, and the home version of &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot; being Saturn exclusive), Capcom later rescinded this announcement, stating instead that PlayStation and Saturn versions of &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; would be released simultaneously and would both be arcade-perfect. However, the PlayStation version was not released until February 26, 1998 in Japan, where it was renamed &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter: EX Edition&quot;. The PlayStation port was also released in North America on June 11, 1998, and Europe in November 1998.

Moreover, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation, both the graphics and gameplay of the port were altered. Several frames of character sprite animations were removed to reduce the amount of RAM usage. Most notably, the tag team combat was omitted. Instead of being able to switch between characters at will, the second character only comes into play during certain attacks, such as Variable Combinations and Variable Counters. In addition, the one-round battles used in the arcade and Sega Saturn versions were extended to a two-out-of-three round setup. The PlayStation version includes a code that allows players to compete in &quot;pseudo-tag team matches&quot;, provided that each player uses their opponent&#x27;s starting character as their partner. For example, if Player 1 is controlling Ryu and Player 2 is controlling Wolverine, then Player 1&#x27;s partner will be Wolverine and Player 2&#x27;s partner will be Ryu. The Hyper Combo Gauge also requires roughly half as many hits to fill as it does in the arcade and Saturn versions, enabling more frequent combos. The PlayStation version has training and survival modes, neither of which are included in other versions of the game.

In June 2020, it was announced that &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; would be included in home arcade cabinets from Arcade1Up alongside other games like &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;. In June 2024, Capcom announced that &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; would be among the games included in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&quot; compilation, which was released the following September.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; on their November 1, 1996 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month, outperforming titles such as &quot;Quiz Nanairo Dreams&quot; and &quot;Stakes Winner 2&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; scored the arcade version three out of five stars. He complimented the tag team mechanic and noted that the game continued the inflation of explosive projectiles and lengthy combos from Capcom&#x27;s previous 2D fighters, but felt this breed of game had been milked out, concluding, &quot;&quot;X-Men Vs. Street Fighter&quot; is a fun game, but it&#x27;s just a bit of an overdose of the kind of game of which we&#x27;ve already played way too much.&quot; In a retrospective review, &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it a score of four stars out of five, praising its combination of two of the most popular franchises of its era and its tag team mechanic.

&quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; was only mildly popular when first released in North American arcades, but after several months it caught on and became a hit.

A number of U.S. publications reviewed the Saturn version as an import. Reviewers praised the Saturn edition&#x27;s close recreation of the original arcade version, particularly the animation and sound quality, fast loading times, and absence of slowdown. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commended the character sprite animations and background details, claiming that &quot;there is no better looking 2D fighter on any console system&quot;. While Gerstmann also praised the port for its fast loading times and lack of slowdown, he criticized the game for its defense-oriented gameplay and recycling of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; music themes. &quot;Game Informer&quot; lauded the port for running and looking identical to its arcade counterpart, declaring it &quot;one of the best arcade conversions ever seen to date.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; focused all its praises on the requisite 4 MB RAM cart, viewing the performance improvement resulting from a simple increase in RAM as a foretaste of the possibilities of the next generation of consoles. &quot;GamePro&quot; was pleased by the tag team feature, responsive controls, and accurate arcade conversion, though they remarked that &quot;the gameplay at times relies more on flash than actual skill.&quot; They gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics and a perfect 5.0 in every other category (sound, control, and fun factor), calling it &quot;one of the most fun fighting games ever to hit the home market.&quot; Rich Leadbetter, reviewing the later cancelled European edition of the Saturn port for the British &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;, criticized the lack of PAL optimization and compared the game unfavorably to its predecessor &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, saying the selection of characters is less exciting and the lack of console-exclusive modes is conspicuous. However, he acknowledged that &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; is a much more accurate conversion of its arcade counterpart, and concluded it to be outstanding in absolute terms.

The PlayStation version, on the other hand, received mixed reviews, holding a 64% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Many reviewers&#x27; critiques were centered on the port&#x27;s various changes as a result of the PlayStation&#x27;s technical restraints. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Game Revolution&quot; all lambasted the port for its removal of tag team battles (which they regarded as &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;″s defining feature) and extremely frequent slowdown. Reviews also criticized the low frame rate and noticeable decline in animation quality. Jeff Gerstmann, again reviewing the game for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, argued that Capcom should never have released &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; for the PlayStation, since it clearly could not handle a decent conversion. While &quot;Game Informer&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; shared many of the same criticisms, both maintained that, while the PlayStation port paled in comparison to the Sega Saturn version, it was still a solid fighting game. &quot;GamePro&quot; said it was &quot;worth a cautionary rental at best&quot;, arguing that the slowdown is not only frequent but dramatic enough to throw off the player&#x27;s timing, making the port not fun to play. They gave it a 3.0 out of 5 for control, 2.0 for fun factor, 4.0 for sound, and 2.5 for graphics. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s four-person review team was split: Dan Hsu and Shawn Smith both said that while the conversion is so terrible that anyone who had played the arcade or Saturn versions would have a hard time enjoying it, it was decent fun on its own merits, while John Ricciardi and Sushi-X both agreed with &quot;GamePro&quot; that the slowdown kills any enjoyment of the game. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;If you&#x27;ve never seen a Capcom fighting game before, this might be fun for a few minutes, but there is not one single positive thing to be said for the trade-offs that Capcom made to get this game to PlayStation. Ouch.&quot;

==Sequel==

A sequel to &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot; was released by Capcom in 1997. &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, while similar in terms of gameplay and art style, replaces a majority of the &quot;X-Men&quot; cast with characters from other Marvel Comics properties, such as Captain America and Spider-Man. The game is notable for introducing &quot;assists&quot; into the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series, which allow players to summon their off-screen character to perform an attack during battle. Like &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation, which were released in 1998 and 1999, respectively.

<doc id="707605" wikidata="Q6806067" url="?curid=707605" title="Medial medullary syndrome">
<text>Medial medullary syndrome, also known as inferior alternating syndrome, hypoglossal alternating hemiplegia, lower alternating hemiplegia, or Dejerine syndrome, is a type of alternating hemiplegia characterized by a set of clinical features resulting from occlusion of the anterior spinal artery. This results in the infarction of medial part of the medulla oblongata.

==Presentation==
The condition usually consists of:


Sensation to the face is preserved, due to the sparing of the trigeminal nucleus.

The syndrome is said to be &quot;alternating&quot; because the lesion causes symptoms both contralaterally and ipsilaterally. Sensation of pain and temperature is preserved, because the spinothalamic tract is located more laterally in the brainstem and is also not supplied by the anterior spinal artery (instead supplied by the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and the vertebral arteries).

==Pathophysiology==

The anterior spinal artery arises bilaterally as two small branches near the termination of the vertebral arteries which descend anterior to the medulla and unite at the level of the foramen magnum. The infarction (which arises in the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery and/or the vertebral arteries) leads to death of the ipsilateral medullary pyramid, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve fibers that pass through the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is spared because it is located more laterally in the brainstem and is not supplied by the anterior spinal artery, but rather by the vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. The trigeminal nucleus is also spared, since most of it is higher up in the pons, and the spinal part of it found in the medulla is lateral to the infarct.

==Diagnosis==
Ipsilateral signs and symptoms - flaccid paralysis (lmn) paralysis and atrophy of one half of tongue (hypoglossal nerve)

Contralateral signs and symptoms-spastic (umn) paralysis of trunk and limbs (contralateral corticospinal tract)
Impaired tactile, proprioceptive and vibration sense of trunk and limbs (contralateral medial lemniscus)

<text>Portal hypertension is defined as increased portal venous pressure, with a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 5 mmHg. Normal portal pressure is 1–4 mmHg; clinically insignificant portal hypertension is present at portal pressures 5–9 mmHg; clinically significant portal hypertension is present at portal pressures greater than 10 mmHg. The portal vein and its branches supply most of the blood and nutrients from the intestine to the liver.

Cirrhosis (a form of chronic liver failure) is the most common cause of portal hypertension; other, less frequent causes are therefore grouped as non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The signs and symptoms of both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension are often similar depending on cause, with patients presenting with abdominal swelling due to ascites, vomiting of blood, and lab abnormalities such as elevated liver enzymes or low platelet counts.

Treatment is directed towards decreasing portal hypertension itself or in the management of its acute and chronic complications. Complications include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and cardiomyopathy.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of portal hypertension include:
* Abdominal swelling and tightness due to ascites, which is free fluid in the peritoneal cavity
* Vomiting blood (hematemesis) from gastric or esophageal varices
* Anorectal varices
* Increased spleen size (splenomegaly), which may lead to lower platelet counts (thrombocytopenia)
* Swollen veins on the anterior abdominal wall (referred to as caput medusae) 

In addition, a widened (dilated) portal vein as seen on a CT scan or MRI may raise the suspicion about portal hypertension. A cutoff value of 13 mm is widely used in this regard, but the diameter is often larger than this is in normal individuals as well.

==Causes==
The causes for portal hypertension are classified as originating in the portal venous system before it reaches the liver (&quot;prehepatic&quot; causes), within the liver (&quot;intrahepatic&quot;) or between the liver and the heart (post-hepatic). The most common cause is cirrhosis (chronic liver failure). Other causes include:

Prehepatic causes
* Portal vein thrombosis
* Splenic vein thrombosis
* Arteriovenous fistula (increased portal blood flow)
* Splenomegaly and/or hypersplenism (increased portal blood flow)

Hepatic causes
* Cirrhosis of any cause.
** alcohol use disorder
** chronic viral hepatitis
** biliary atresia
** Primary biliary cirrhosis
* Primary sclerosing cholangitis
* Chronic pancreatitis
* Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia
* Schistosomiasis
* Congenital hepatic fibrosis
* Nodular regenerative hyperplasia
* Fibrosis of space of Disse
* Granulomatous or infiltrative liver diseases (Gaucher disease, mucopolysaccharidosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoproliferative malignancies, amyloidosis, etc.)
* Toxicity (from arsenic, copper, vinyl chloride monomers, mineral oil, vitamin A, azathioprine, dacarbazine, methotrexate, amiodarone, etc.)
* Viral hepatitis
* Fatty liver disease
* Veno-occlusive disease

Posthepatic causes
* Inferior vena cava obstruction
* Right-sided heart failure, e.g. from constrictive pericarditis
* Budd–Chiari syndrome also known as hepatic vein thrombosis

==Pathophysiology==
=== Cirrhotic portal hypertension ===
The pathophysiology of cirrhotic portal hypertension is indicated by increased resistance to blood flow in vessels via different mechanisms. There is sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction (SEC), hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, Kupffer cell activation, and myofibroblast activation.

Normally, SECs generate nitric oxide, which has several functions, including the maintenance of vascular tone and prevention of HSC activation. HSC activation results in liver fibrosis, which also predisposes to portal hypertension.

Nitric oxide is an endogenous vasodilator and it regulates intrahepatic vascular tone (it is produced from L-arginine). Nitric oxide inhibition has been shown in some studies to increase portal hypertension and hepatic response to norepinephrine.

Rising portal pressures leads to increased production of vasodilators, defective response to vasoconstrictors, and the formation of new blood vessels all within the splanchnic circulation. All of this is done in order to recruit more blood to sinusoids, thereby promoting more blood flow within the portal vein, further contributing to portal hypertension. Splanchnic vasodilation results in decreased effective arterial blood volume, causing low blood pressure. To compensate for this low blood pressure, neurohumoral factors (RAAS, SNS, ADH) are activated, leading to sodium and water retention, and therefore, a high volume state.

=== Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension ===
The pathophysiology of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension is most commonly disrupted blood flow to or from the liver. This results in a backing up of blood in either the liver or the vessels supplying it, leading to an increased portal pressure.

==Diagnosis==
Ultrasonography (US) is the first-line imaging technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of portal hypertension because it is non-invasive, low-cost and can be performed on-site.

A dilated portal vein (diameter of greater than 13 or 15 mm) is a sign of portal hypertension, with a sensitivity estimated at 12.5% or 40%. On Doppler ultrasonography, a slow velocity of &lt;16 cm/s in addition to dilatation in the main portal vein are diagnostic of portal hypertension. Other signs of portal hypertension on ultrasound include a portal flow mean velocity of less than 12 cm/s, porto–systemic collateral veins (patent paraumbilical vein, spleno–renal collaterals and dilated left and short gastric veins), splenomegaly and signs of cirrhosis (including nodularity of the liver surface).

The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement has been accepted as the gold standard for assessing the severity of portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is defined as HVPG greater than or equal to 5 mmHg and is considered to be clinically significant when HVPG exceeds 10 to 12 mmHg.

==Complications==

===Ascites===
====Pathogenesis====
The activation of neurohumoral factors as described in the &quot;Pathophysiology&quot; section results in a high volume state due to sodium and water retention. Additionally, with cirrhosis, there is increased hydrostatic pressure and decreased production of albumin, which lead to decreased oncotic pressure. Combined, this leads to leakage of fluid into the peritoneal cavity.

====Management====
The management of ascites needs to be gradual to avoid sudden changes in systemic volume status, which can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, kidney failure, and death. The management includes salt restriction in diet, diuretics to urinate excess salt and water (furosemide, spironolactone), paracentesis to manually remove the ascitic fluid, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).

===Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis===
====Pathogenesis====
In cirrhosis, there is bacterial overgrowth in the intestinal tract and increased permeability of the intestinal wall. These bacteria (most commonly E. coli &amp; Klebsiella) are able to pass through the intestinal wall and into ascitic fluid, leading to an inflammatory response.

====Management====
Antibiotic treatment is usually with a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) after a diagnostic paracentesis. Patients are also given albumin.

====Prevention====
Primary prevention is given to high-risk groups; secondary prevention is given to anyone who has previously been diagnosed with SBP. Medications for prevention are usually fluoroquinolones or sulfonamides.

===Variceal hemorrhage===

====Pathogenesis====
Increased portal pressure leads to dilation of existing vessels and the formation of new vascular connections. These newly formed vascular connections are weak and prone to rupture, which leads to bleeding. Esophageal varices are due to a connection between the left gastric vein and the azygos-hemiazygos veins; gastroesophageal varices are due to connections between either the anterior branch of the left gastric vein and esophageal veins or the short gastric &amp; posterior gastric vein and esophageal veins.

====Management====
Both pharmacological (non-specific β-blockers, nitrate isosorbide mononitrate, vasopressin such as terlipressin) and endoscopic (banding ligation) treatment have similar results. TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting) is effective at reducing the rate of rebleeding.

The management of active variceal bleeding includes administering vasoactive drugs (somatostatin, octreotide), endoscopic banding ligation, balloon tamponade and TIPS.

===Hepatic encephalopathy===
==== Pathogenesis ====
In portal hypertension, ammonia levels increase and this ammonia can cross the blood brain barrier. As brain cells attempt to clear the ammonia, glutamine is formed excessively, which results in swelling of brain cells and neurologic dysfunction.

====Management====
A treatment plan may involve lactulose, enemas, and use of antibiotics such as rifaximin, neomycin, vancomycin, and the quinolones. Restriction of dietary protein was recommended but this is now refuted by a clinical trial which shows no benefit. Instead, the maintenance of adequate nutrition is now advocated.

===Hepatorenal syndrome===
==== Pathogenesis ====
Activation of neurohumoral factors (discussed in the Pathophysiology section) leads to renal vasoconstriction, which results in decreased blood supply to the kidneys and therefore, a decreased glomerular filtration rate. This can be an acute kidney injury (HRS type 1) or a slowly progressive kidney failure (HRS type 2).

====Management====
Management depends on whether or not patients are in the intensive care unit (ICU). When not in the ICU, patients are given albumin and splanchnic vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin. This use of splanchnic vasoconstrictors increases mean arterial pressure, which increases the amount of blood supplied to the kidneys. This decreases the compensatory neurohumoral response that led to the renal vasoconstriction and improves overall kidney function.

===Cardiomyopathy===
====Pathogenesis====
Initially, the heart compensates for the decreased effective arterial blood volume that is the result of splanchnic vasodilation by increasing cardiac output, which results in high-output heart failure. Eventually, the heart will no longer be able to maintain this increased cardiac output in the setting of prolonged splanchnic vasodilation. As a result, the heart will not fill with or pump out blood appropriately.

====Management====
Non-selective beta blockers have been successful in some clinical studies. Patients are also treated with diuretics. Liver transplant may reverse the cardiomyopathy.

==Treatment==
===Portosystemic shunts===

Selective shunts select non-intestinal flow to be shunted to the systemic venous drainage while leaving the intestinal venous drainage to continue to pass through the liver. The most well known of this type is the splenorenal. This connects the splenic vein to the left renal vein thus reducing portal system pressure while minimizing any encephalopathy. In an H-shunt, which could be mesocaval (from the superior mesenteric vein to the inferior vena cava) or could be, portocaval (from the portal vein to the inferior vena cava) a graft, either synthetic or the preferred vein harvested from elsewhere on the patient&#x27;s body, is connected between the superior mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava. The size of this shunt will determine how selective it is.

With the advent of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS), portosystemic shunts are less performed. TIPS has the advantage of being easier to perform and doesn&#x27;t disrupt the liver&#x27;s vascularity.

<text>Charles Robert Jenkins () was a United States Army deserter, North Korean prisoner, and voice for Japanese abductees in North Korea.

Driven by fear of combat and possible service in the Vietnam War, then-Sergeant Jenkins abandoned his patrol and walked across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in January 1965. Instead of being sent to the Soviet Union and then traded back to the US, Jenkins was held captive in North Korea for over 39 years. While kept prisoner, Jenkins was tortured, forced to wed a captured Japanese national, and cast in North Korean propaganda videos.

With improved Japanese–North Korean relations, Jenkins was allowed to travel to Japan and flee North Korea in 2004. After reporting to Camp Zama that September, Jenkins was court-martialed and served 25 days as an inmate in the brig at United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka. Until his death in 2017, Jenkins lived in his wife&#x27;s childhood Sado home with her and their two daughters, wrote a book about his experiences in North Korea, worked in a local museum, and was treated like a celebrity by the Japanese.

==Early life==
Charles Robert Jenkins was born on in Rich Square, North Carolina, to Patti Casper Jenkins. He had at least two siblings: a younger sister (Pat) and a younger brother (Stanford). Jenkins dropped out of Rich Square High School—precipitated by either a sports injury or the mid-1950s death of his father—in the seventh grade.

==US Army==

Lacking a high school diploma, Jenkins enlisted in the North Carolina National Guard from 1955 through April 1958. After his honorable discharge from the Guard, he enlisted in the active-duty United States Army that same year as a light weapons infantryman. First stationed at Fort Hood, Jenkins next volunteered to deploy with the 7th Infantry Division to South Korea from August 1960 through September 1961; while there, he was promoted to sergeant. After briefly returning to the US, Jenkins was assigned to the 3rd Armored Division in West Germany until 1964. That year, he volunteered for a second deployment to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

===Desertion===
On 5 January 1965, 24-year-old Sergeant Jenkins was stationed at the DMZ with the Army&#x27;s 8th Cavalry Regiment when he decided to desert the United States Armed Forces because he was being ordered to lead &quot;more aggressive, provocative patrols&quot;, and there were rumors that his unit would be sent to Vietnam. After drinking ten beers to build his courage, Jenkins went on patrol with his squad. At 2:30am, after telling the other three men that &quot;he heard a noise&quot;, Jenkins disappeared into the night approximately south of Panmunjom. To show his peaceful intentions, he removed the rounds from his M14 rifle, and tied a white t-shirt to the muzzle before walking for several cold hours towards North Korea. He had planned to claim asylum with the Soviet Union and then return to the US for discharge and punishment via a prisoner exchange. He was instead held prisoner in North Korea for years.

The Army declared Jenkins a defector based on four letters that he left behind in his barracks; one, addressed to his mother, read: &quot;Forgive me, for I know what I must do. Tell my family I love them. Love, Charles.&quot; Jenkins&#x27; family disputed this determination because he &quot;always either signed letters &#x27;Robert&#x27; or used his nickname &#x27;Super&#x27;.&quot; In 1996, Jenkins was reclassified by the US military as a deserter. Jenkins&#x27; nephew, James Hyman, was a decades-long strident defendant of the theory that his uncle had been kidnapped by North Koreans.

Jenkins would later tell Professor Robert Boynton (of New York University) &quot;that he had been a double-agent, sent to North Korea by the U.S. to spy on them&quot;. Boynton disbelieved Jenkins&#x27; claim, calling it &quot;his attempt to maintain some dignity, and prove he wasn&#x27;t just a hapless sap who made a life-altering mistake.&quot;

==In North Korea==
Jenkins was initially housed with fellow US deserters Larry Allen Abshier, James Joseph Dresnok, and Jerry Wayne Parrish. The American men fought amongst themselves, with Jenkins later describing the Dresnok as a bully who informed on the others to their captors. On 26 January 1965, North Korean radio announced that Jenkins had defected there &quot;because of disgust with conditions in South Korea and that he believed life was better under the .&quot; In 1966, the four men attempted escape by seeking asylum at the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang, but were unsuccessful. In 1972, the four US servicemen in North Korea were given their own homes and declared citizens, though their &quot;constant surveillance, beatings and torture&quot; continued.

During his imprisonment in North Korea, Jenkins was made to memorize Kim Il Sung&#x27;s writings and work for the communist state as an English teacher and translator. Jenkins&#x27; lessons in American English lasted until 1985 when it was decided that his pronounced Southern accent was more a hindrance than not.
In 1978, Hitomi Soga (born in ) was a Japanese student nurse in Sado, Niigata when she and her mother were kidnapped by North Korean agents and taken to their country to train more agents there. At the direction of the North Korean government, the 21-year-old Soga was assigned to Jenkins in 1980, and they were married weeks later on 8 August. They had two daughters: Mika (born in 1983) and Brinda (born in 1985). An interviewer of Jenkins would later tell &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that Jenkins&#x27; relationship with Soga was remarkable: Jenkins said &quot;several times that she was the best thing that had ever happened to him [...] &#x27;She saved my life,&#x27; he told me. I suspect he was right.&quot; After their release from North Korea in the early 2000s, Jenkins offered to dissolve their marriage, as it had been imposed upon them; Soga declined.

During the North Korean famine that killed millions of North Koreans, as an asset for propaganda, Jenkins and his family still received rations of clothing, insect-infested rice, and soap. In their 2004 testimony, Jenkins and Soga told the US Army about their living accommodations in North Korea—or lack thereof. While heat, warm water, and food were scarce, the omnipresent state surrounded them and their home with barbed wire, hidden microphones, and &quot;political supervisors&quot;. By the time he left, Jenkins was receiving from the North Korean government a monthly income of , and his daughters were enrolled at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, possibly for training to infiltrate South Korea.

===Acting===

In 1978, production began on the 20-film series &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; which tells the North Korean version of the Korean War and its antecedents. Jenkins was made to play Dr. Kelton, a capitalist warmonger who endeavored to extend the war to benefit the US arms industry. These films made Jenkins a celebrity; he was recognized on the street as &quot;Dr. Kelton!&quot; () and made to sign autographs. One of these films was delivered to Jenkins&#x27; family in 1997—their first sight of Jenkins since his desertion.

Jenkins&#x27; last North Korean film was in 2000, about the communists&#x27; capture of , portraying a US aircraft carrier captain. His celebrity status as an alleged-defector-turned-movie-star also afforded him greater social cachet as a state prize, allowing him to see Soviet dignitaries and diplomats who piteously slipped him materials and information from outside North Korea.

==Expatriation==
Due to the 2002 Japan–North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, Soga was allowed to leave for Japan on 15 October for ten days; she did not return to North Korea. The government of Japan petitioned the US to pardon Jenkins, hoping Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi could bring back the American and his daughters after a May diplomatic trip. Ultimately, they refused to leave; because of the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement, he still faced court-martial if he traveled to Japan—because the statute of limitations for desertion was 40 years (5 January 2005)—and possible capital punishment.

Instead, Pyongyang eventually permitted Jenkins and his daughters to fly to Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Indonesia where they reunited with Soga and the Japanese government promised residency for the whole family. After his release from North Korea, Jenkins was tall, and only weighed , having lost his appendix, one testicle, and part of a US Army tattoo (cut off without anesthetic) to North Korea. Of the four 1960s deserters to North Korea, he was the only one to ever leave. Upon arrival in Japan from Indonesia, Jenkins spent a month in the hospital at Tokyo Women&#x27;s Medical University to recover from complications of prostate surgery (performed in North Korea before he left).

===Court-martial===

On 11 September 2004, he presented himself to Lieutenant Colonel Paul Nigara at Camp Zama, saying with a salute, &quot;Sir, I&#x27;m Sergeant Jenkins and I&#x27;m reporting&quot;. Jenkins&#x27; court-martial began and ended on 3 November 2004. He was the longest-missing deserter to return to the US military.

Represented by Captain James D. Culp, Jenkins&#x27; single-day court-martial (&quot;United States v. Jenkins&quot;) was convened by United States Army, Japan on 3 November 2004. Colonel Denise Vowell was judge for the bench trial. In accordance with his pre-trial agreement, Jenkins pled guilty to desertion and aiding the enemy (the latter for teaching English in North Korea). Vowell sentenced him to &quot;six months&#x27; confinement, total forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, and a dishonorable discharge.&quot; Major General Elbert N. Perkins, the general court-martial convening authority, changed the confinement to 30 days, and approved the remainder of the sentence, to be in the brig at United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka—where, Captain King H. Dietriech assured reporters, &quot;there will be no special treatment for Private Jenkins.&quot;

Jenkins spent only 25 days in the brig; he was released early for good conduct on 27 November 2004. Having waived &quot;his post-trial and appellate rights&quot;, Jenkins&#x27; demotion and dishonorable discharge were executed on 18 July 2005.
BBC News reported that Jenkins may have received only the 30-day sentence because of the intelligence he provided the US. In 2009, Jenkins told &quot;Vice&quot; that in addition to receiving a sergeant&#x27;s salary while in prison—a monthly rate of —he spent his time working with military intelligence. According to Jenkins, the sentence was &quot;all a big set-up for the outside world so it looked like justice was done. After all, I betrayed my country and people wanted to see me get punished for that – but I was just helping the government with what I knew. They just gave me the shortest sentence possible with a week off for good behaviour so it didn&#x27;t seem like I was let off the hook.&quot;

===Civilian life===
After his release from prison, Jenkins lived with his family in Soga&#x27;s Sado childhood home. In June 2005, he visited the United States with his wife and children. They travelled to his home town of Rich Square, North Carolina, where Charles was reunited with his 91-year-old mother, whom he had not seen in four decades. Jenkins&#x27; mother and sister still lived in the state when he expatriated from North Korea. When his mother died at the age of 94, Jenkins again travelled to Rich Square to bury her.

Jenkins continued to fear that agents of Kim Jong Il would retaliate against him in Japan; he was unable to eat sashimi out of fear it would make him sick from the memories; and he was more fluent in Korean than English. To record what he remembered and experienced, Jenkins published a memoir in 2008: &quot;The Reluctant Communist&quot;. In Japan, Jenkins fostered an interest in motorcycling; he was featured on the cover of &quot;Mr. Bike&quot;, a Japanese motorcycle-enthusiast magazine.

The Japanese Ministry of Justice expedited Jenkins&#x27; application for permanent residency, which was awarded on 15 July 2008. Jenkins worked in Sado selling at a local museum. Treated like a celebrity, he frequently posed for photographs with Japanese patrons, at times up to 300 per hour. In Japan, he was credited with helping bring global attention to the North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens.

On 11 December 2017, Jenkins collapsed outside his Sado home, and later died of cardiovascular disease.

He and his brother Robyn Miller became famous due to the success of their computer game &quot;Myst&quot;, which remained the all-time best-selling computer game from its release in 1993 until that record was surpassed by &quot;The Sims&quot; nearly a decade later. Rand also worked on the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Riven&quot;, and later reprised his role as protagonist Atrus in &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;; &quot;realMyst&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot;; and &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot;. He also co-authored Myst novels &quot;The Book of Atrus&quot;, &quot;The Book of Ti&#x27;ana&quot;, and &quot;The Book of D&#x27;ni&quot;.

He remains the C.E.O. of Cyan Worlds.

== Career==

Before the success of &quot;Myst&quot;, Rand and Robyn Miller released &quot;The Manhole&quot;, &quot;Spelunx&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Osmo and the Worlds Beyond the Mackerel&quot;.

Miller, his brother, and the company they founded came to international prominence with the success of &quot;Myst&quot; in 1993 and its sequel &quot;Riven&quot; in 1997, both of which broke sales records.

Following the success of &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Riven&quot;, Miller spent nearly seven years spearheading the development of &quot;&quot;, an online massively multiplayer extension of the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise. Miller noted that &quot;the essence of &quot;Uru&quot; was people love to explore and the fault in the one-off games is you get to explore until it stops. Well, what if it didn&#x27;t stop? What if the worlds continued?&quot;

Upon its release in 2003, &quot;Uru&quot; was a commercial failure. Online services were ceased by original publisher Ubisoft in 2004. Despite this earlier setback, Cyan Worlds announced in Los Angeles at E3 2006 that they would be partnering with GameTap to bring &quot;Uru Live&quot; online again. On February 15, 2007, &quot;Myst Online: Uru Live&quot; was released. However, this version also failed to attain sufficient popularity and was shut down in 2008.

&quot;Uru&quot;″s failure caused Cyan Worlds to briefly cease operations.

Miller appeared shocked by &quot;Uru Live&quot;″s ultimate failure, as reflected in his letter to the &quot;Uru Live&quot; community, which he wrote to explain why the game had to be shut down for an indefinite amount of time. In a previous interview, Miller had stated that finance from outside investment, not technology, was the reason for the failed project: &quot;I think the biggest failure was running out of money, and thus running out of time, and thus losing control of our own destiny. No matter what promises are made or common goals are agreed upon, whoever pays the bills has the final say.&quot;

On October 17, 2013, Miller announced the development of &quot;Obduction&quot;, intended to serve as the spiritual successor to the &quot;Myst&quot; series, via a Kickstarter campaign. The game was released in 2016 (for PC) and 2017 (for Mac OS). Reviews for &quot;Obduction&quot; were largely positive.

== Personal life ==

Miller lives in Spokane, Washington, and has a wife, Robin, three daughters, and two stepdaughters.

<text>Renny Harlin (born Renny Lauri Mauritz Harjola; 15 March 1959) is a Finnish film director, producer, and screenwriter who has worked in Hollywood, Europe, and China. His best-known films include &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, and &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;.

Harlin&#x27;s films have grossed over $520 million in the United States and over $1.2 billion in the worldwide aggregate box office, making him the 151st highest-grossing director in the global film market , and the most internationally successful Finnish filmmaker in terms of revenue.

==Early life==
Harlin was born in Riihimäki, Finland. His father was Oiva Harjola (formerly Harlin), a chief physician at Riihimäki Hospital, and his mother was Liisa Koskiluoma, a nurse. Since 1987, Renny&#x27;s surname has been Harlin, his father&#x27;s original surname. Renny has a half-brother, Veli-Pekka Harjola, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in sprint canoeing.

==Career==

===Early years===
After studying at the University of Art and Design Helsinki, Harlin started his career in the film business in the beginning of the 1980s, directing commercials and company films for companies like Shell. Later, he worked as a buyer for a Finnish film distributor and met fellow Finn Markus Selin in Los Angeles in 1982. They became friends and started writing a screenplay called &quot;Arctic Heat&quot;, which later evolved into &quot;Born American&quot;, with Mike Norris in the leading role. They secured financing from the U.S., and in 1986, &quot;Born American&quot; became the most expensive Finnish film ever. It opened in the U.S. in over 1,000 theaters. By July 9, 1986, he set up his own production company with partner Markus Selin, Larmark Productions, with the first two projects went low-budget, and it was a Los Angeles-based production company.

Harlin moved to Los Angeles and got a job from Irwin Yablans, who offered him a script of &quot;Prison&quot; to film. The film was made with a low budget and distributed with only 42 copies. In the same year, 1988, he got a job from New Line Cinema to direct &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; (1988) after meeting producer Robert Shaye, who at first did not want Harlin to direct the film. It became the highest-grossing film in the series until the 2003 release of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, and its budget was seven times greater than the original &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;.

===Breakthrough and the 1990s===
After the success of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;, Harlin was set to direct the science-fiction thriller &quot;Alien 3&quot;. He was attached to the project for a little over a year, but he left due to creative differences with the producers.

The comedy &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; and the action thriller &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; were edited simultaneously and released a week apart in 1990. The former flopped, but the latter was a commercial success. Harlin achieved critical acclaim the following year when he produced &quot;Rambling Rose&quot; through his own Midnight Sun Pictures for director Martha Coolidge. The film won Best Feature at the 1992 Independent Spirit Awards and earned its star and Harlin&#x27;s then-partner Laura Dern a Best Actress Oscar nomination at the 1992 Academy Awards.

Harlin, Markus Selin and a number of other businessmen founded the indoor amusement park Planet FunFun in Kerava, Finland, in 1992, which included everything from a tropical park to a cinema park, the latter of which Harlin also gave his own special stamp to by loaning his film sets and props to special theme rooms. The park also hosted sports competitions and filmed television series. However Planet FunFun was short-lived, closing in 1995.

1993&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; was Harlin&#x27;s first film with Sylvester Stallone. Harlin&#x27;s career suffered a blow with the pirate adventure film &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; in 1995, which starred Harlin&#x27;s then-wife, Geena Davis. &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; was one of the biggest box-office bombs of all time, losing $147 million and leading to the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures. Harlin did go on to have moderate success with &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, starring Samuel L. Jackson and Davis in 1996, and the science fiction horror film &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; in 1999.

===2000s===
Harlin wanted to direct a movie based on Formula One, but unable to secure the rights, he instead produced the film &quot;Driven&quot; in 2001, based on the American Champ Car series.

Harlin took over directing the action mystery film &quot;Mindhunters&quot; when the original director Peter Howitt dropped out, but the release was delayed by studio conflicts. Harlin went on to re-shoot a more traditional horror version of &quot;&quot; (2004), after the studio was unhappy with the version cut by director Paul Schrader, which was more of a psychological drama. &quot;Mindhunters&quot; was released in the US in 2005.

Harlin directed the WWE Studios action movie &quot;12 Rounds&quot;, starring John Cena. It was released in March 2009. In 2009, Harlin directed an independent war film in Georgia. The film, &quot;5 Days of War&quot;, was a story about the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia in the region of South Ossetia. The film included real-life figures, including Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, played by Andy García.

===2010s and move to China===

Harlin next directed the 2013 film &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pass&quot;, set in Russia&#x27;s Ural Mountains and loosely based on the Dyatlov Pass incident in 1959, when nine experienced hikers were found dead. Harlin then directed &quot;The Legend of Hercules&quot;, which opened in theatres on 10 January 2014. One of two Hercules movies released in 2014 – the other being &quot;Hercules&quot;, starring Dwayne Johnson – it was critically panned and was a box-office bomb.

Harlin directed the 2016 action comedy film &quot;Skiptrace&quot;, which starred Jackie Chan alongside Johnny Knoxville and Fan Bingbing. He then directed the 2018 film &quot;Legend of the Ancient Sword&quot; for Alibaba Pictures, based on a Chinese role-playing video game. The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only $1.25 million against a budget of $11 million. More recently, his film &quot;The Misfits&quot; received U.S. and international deals.

In 2021, he was selected as jury member at 11th Beijing International Film Festival for Tiantan Awards.

===Unproduced and upcoming films===
Harlin was interested in making a biopic about fellow Finnish personality, composer and national hero Jean Sibelius. &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; used Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Finlandia&quot; in an crucial scene, but the &quot;Sibelius&quot; movie was eventually directed by Timo Koivusalo in 2003.

In the late 1980s, Harlin was attached as the original director of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, developing the film for a year before departing from the production due to creative differences.

In August 1992, Harlin had lined up &quot;Warriors of the Rainbow&quot; to be his next film following &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, reteaming with producer Mario Kassar. The script was by David Williamson and John Briley and focused on Greenpeace, specifically the early 1970s work of Robert Hunter. &quot;My life&#x27;s mission is to make that movie,&quot; Harlin stressed to &quot;Variety&quot;. &quot;I hope it will attract a name star. I want to make movies of substance–that will entertain and make people think.&quot; He wanted to cast both John Lithgow and Laura Dern for undisclosed parts in the film. At the time, he planned to follow it up with a film for Warner Bros., &quot;The Original Gangster&quot;, which deals with black L.A. gangs in the 1960s and with one of the founders of the Crips. Richard Dilello was writing the script. Harlin dubbed the story as one about &quot;making peace instead of violence.&quot;

In March 1993, it was reported that following the success of the Western &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, TriStar Pictures had reentered development on an 18-year-old screenplay &quot;Hell and High Water&quot;, with Harlin directing and John Patrick Shanley hired to rewrite. The post-Civil War drama is a fictional tale of the first white men to travel down the Colorado River. It was originally written by Franklin Cohen under the title &quot;Running the Wild Big Red&quot;, which had been optioned in 1974 by David Brower and David Foster and then sold to Columbia Pictures. Over the next two decades, screenwriters Walter Newman and Paul F. Edwards wrote various new drafts to no avail. It was tentatively scheduled to go into production in August 1993, but this never occurred.

In June 1993, Harlin was attached to direct John Milius&#x27; script of the Sgt. Rock comics as his next film following &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, in which he was to reteam with producer Joel Silver. Arnold Schwarzenegger was to star in the title role. At the time, Harlin was also developing the directing vehicle &quot;Love and Honor&quot;, an epic in Russia. Neither film was ever made.

In July 1993, Harlin was set to direct &quot;Flies&quot; (also referred to as &quot;The Fly III&quot;), a sequel to Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Fly&quot; with his then-wife Geena Davis reprising her role. The script by Richard Jefferies featured a story in which Davis&#x27; character gives birth to twin boys, and is later suspected of murder when she merges their untainted human genes into a single being, fearing that they both would begin developing fly-hybrid characteristics. Harlin and Davis were also going to collaborate on an adaptation of &quot;Mistress of the Seas&quot;, but opted to do &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; instead.

In April 1995, HBO was reportedly developing a horror series called &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, about phobias, set to be directed by Harlin, written by Shane Black and produced by Michael De Luca. 

In May 1995, following &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;, Harlin and Davis intended to follow-up with &quot;Exit Zero&quot;, a spec script by Kurt Wimmer about &quot;what would happen if the Internet achieves consciousness and decides that the fate of the world is better off in its hands than it is in mankind&#x27;s.&quot; Harlin was to direct and produce for New Line Cinema.

In 1996, he was attached to producer Joel Silver&#x27;s long-in-the-works project &quot;Isobar&quot;.

In 1997 he was going to direct &quot;Frequency&quot; for New Line Cinema, but allegedly the film got in trouble after Sylvester Stallone asked too much for playing the lead. Eventually film was directed by Gregory Hoblit and starring Dennis Quaid.

In 1998, Warner Bros. acquired a pitch by Talley Griffith called &quot;Time Out&quot;, which Harlin developed to direct into a film.

In 1999, Harlin began developing the action-comedy &quot;Nosebleed&quot; at New Line Cinema&quot;,&quot; starring Jackie Chan as a window washer who foils a terrorist attack to destroy the World Trade Center. The film was delayed after changing studios to MGM in May 2001. After the September 11 attacks the plot was drastically rewritten ultimately before being completely shelved. Chan later told &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; that the film was scheduled to begin filming at the North Tower less than two hours before it was hit by American Airlines Flight 11, and that he only escaped the attack because he made a last-minute decision to travel to Toronto to begin filming &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; instead. However, Chan&#x27;s claim has been criticized as improbable since the production was delayed after the change in studios and since he was contracted for the production of &quot;The Tuxedo&quot; in Toronto months before the attacks.

Harlin&#x27;s next project after &quot;Driven&quot; was to be a movie adaptation of the Ray Bradbury short story &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot;, but Harlin left the project after a disagreement with Bradbury. Although the director was changed, Harlin was credited as a producer when the finished film was released in 2005.

In December 2004, it was reported that Harlin was hired develop and direct a feature based on the graphic novel &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; by Joe Casey, for producers Adrian Askarieh and Daniel Alter.

In 2006, Harlin collaborated with Markus Selin to direct a biopic of the Finnish President and Marshal of Finland Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, but budget constraints put the project on hold. Instead, Harlin made another foray into low-budget horror with &quot;The Covenant&quot;, which was another moderate commercial success. In 2007 the Mannerheim film project resumed temporarily and Harlin returned to Finland. The screenplay was written by Heikki Vihinen and Marko Leino, and was scheduled to be the largest film production in Finnish history. Production began in 2008 with Mikko Nousiainen starring as Mannerheim, and the film was to premiere in Helsinki on January 15, 2010. However, 30% of the funding was cut by one of the financiers due to the Great Recession, and the delay meant that the time window for shooting the winter scenes during the spring of 2009 passed. Pre-production finally commenced in 2010, and the project was assigned to Dome Karukoski in August 2011.

In 2007, it was announced that Harlin would direct an adaptation of the comic-book series &quot;Brodie&#x27;s Law&quot;.

In 2011 it was reported that he was planning a sequel to &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;.

On 16 June 2017 it was announced Harlin will direct &quot;Hanging Coffins&quot; for Shanghai Film Group and Shanghai New Wave Films. On 18 June 2017, it was announced Harlin will direct &quot;Operation Somalia&quot;. The film&#x27;s story, based on true events, revolves around a rescue operation against Somali pirates mounted by Chinese Special Operations Forces.
On 8 May 2018, it was announced Harlin will direct &quot;Solara&quot;, a Chinese sci-fi epic revolving around an international team that must work together to save Earth from a global catastrophe. On 18 June 2018 it was announced Harlin will direct &quot;Operation Wild&quot;.

On January 19, 2021, it was announced that Harlin will direct the new &quot;Inspector Palmu&quot; film, based on a character created by Finnish writer Mika Waltari. Although the film is shot in Finland, unlike the previous Finnish-language &quot;Palmu&quot; films, Harlin&#x27;s film is becoming an international English-language production, where an actor is also being sought internationally for the title role. Filming of the new &quot;Inspector Palmu&quot; should begin at the end of 2024.

==Personal life==
Harlin was married to actress Geena Davis from 1993 to 1998. He had a son, Lucas, with Davis&#x27; personal assistant in 1997, which prompted the divorce. Since September 2021, Harlin has been married to fitness athlete and school teacher Johanna Harlin (née Kokkila). They have a daughter, born July 2022 and a son, born April 2024, both in Miami, Florida. 

Harlin lived in the United States from the mid-1980s until 2014, when he moved to China. After Harlin finished the shooting of the Finnish film &quot;Reunion 3: Singles Cruise&quot; in 2020, he moved to Sofia, Bulgaria.

<text>Uatu (), often simply known as the Watcher, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #13 (April 1963). He is a member of the Watchers, an extraterrestrial species who in the distant past stationed themselves across space to monitor the activities of other species. Uatu is the Watcher assigned to observe Earth and its Solar System.

The character has been adapted into other media, such as video games, toys, and television. Jeffrey Wright voiced Uatu in the Marvel Cinematic Universe animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021–2024) on Disney+.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared without a name in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #13 (Apr 1963), and periodically reappeared in that title. He then starred in &quot;Tales of the Watcher&quot;, a backup feature that ran in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #49-58 (Jan 1964-Oct 1965), &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #1-7 (Aug 1968-Aug 1969) and &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #23 (Nov 1969). His origin was revealed in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #53 (May 1964), and his name was revealed in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; #39 (Jul 1975).

The character has made many cameo appearances across the Marvel Universe since his debut, including &quot;Avengers&quot;, &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, &quot;Quasar&quot;, and &quot;Marvel Point One&quot;. He acts as the narrator in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;What If?&quot; title.

In the 2014 &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, the character is murdered, sparking a hunt for his murderer. The core miniseries of that storyline is written by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Mike Deodato.

==Fictional character biography==
The Watchers are among the oldest and most advanced beings in the cosmos. Eons ago, they sought to spread their knowledge to benefit the lesser races of the Universe. Their first attempt, on the planet Prosilicus, included sharing nuclear technology. When the Watchers returned to Prosilicus, they found the natives had all but destroyed themselves in a nuclear war. The Watchers blamed themselves for the catastrophe and vowed to never again meddle in the affairs of other races. Instead, they passively observe and record events for those who will come after the universe ends.

Uatu is the Watcher assigned to watch over Earth from his home in the Blue Area of the Moon. He is an altruist and has bent or violated his oath on numerous occasions to aid humanity. He revealed himself to the Fantastic Four when they discovered his home, telling them he would leave the Moon to observe humanity from a more distant area. He proceeded to violate his oath several more times to aid the Fantastic Four. His most notable transgression was in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48, in which he tried, and failed, to prevent the Silver Surfer from bringing the planet-devourer Galactus to the Earth. For his continuous disregard for the Watchers&#x27; mission, Uatu is once placed on trial by the Watchers. He is found guilty, but is released on his own recognizance.

When the Shi&#x27;ar seek to prosecute Mister Fantastic for saving Galactus&#x27; life, Uatu serves as his lawyer and receives help from Odin, Eternity, and even Galactus himself to explain that Galactus is part of the universe&#x27;s balance. Uatu is removed from his duty as Watcher of the Earth, but he returns to observe the world of which he has become so fond. During the &quot;GLX-Mas Special&quot;, Uatu appears in Wisconsin, after Squirrel Girl and her sidekick Monkey Joe defeat Thanos. He confirms that the Thanos she defeated was real, not a clone or copy. Uatu is present when the Dreaming Celestial awakens, but he turns away, unwilling to watch. After scanning him, the Dreaming Celestial reveals Uatu has broken his pact of non-interference almost 400 times.

Uatu later arrived in Death Valley to watch the battle between Hulk and Red Hulk only to be ambushed and knocked out by Red Hulk. Upon sensing the Red Hole of Dargala about to make a new Omegex, Uatu saw to it that its next target was Red Hulk in hopes that Red Hulk would be able to defeat it. Since these events, Uatu has restricted himself to appearing to observe particularly cosmic events in the Marvel Universe, such as visiting the heroes prior to the vote on the Superhuman Registration Act, the final battle of the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, and the Hood&#x27;s acquisition of the Infinity Gems, reflecting during these appearances that he cannot do any more or he may be taken from Earth altogether.

Uatu later visited Red Hulk at the time when he was on an asteroid helping Thor to close a black hole. He does tell Red Hulk of his impending doom, but cannot describe it due to the Watchers&#x27; vow to not interfere. Uatu then watched Red Hulk fail at jumping across other asteroids until he was rescued by Thor. Uatu temporarily abandoned his post to travel to the Red Hole of Dargala. His absence was noticed by the other Watchers who sent the Watcher Uravo to find him. After being unable to find him, Uravo informed Yruku and the other Watchers that he thinks Uatu has become unhinged ever since Red Hulk attacked and absorbed some of his powers. When Uravo finally caught up to Uatu at the Red Hole of Dargala, Uatu tells Uravo that they should not have come together. They witnessed Omegex emerge from the Red Hole of Dargala as it heads towards Earth to target Red Hulk. Uatu and Uravo later tracked Omegex&#x27;s trail as it gets closer to Earth.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Uatu appeared next to Odin as Thor assists the Avengers. Aware that Uatu is there to witness the rise of the Serpent&#x27;s daughter Skadi, Odin called Uatu a &quot;titanic mute baby too dumb to be of use.&quot; Uatu later left while Odin kept boasting about himself. Uatu later watched Red Hulk&#x27;s fight with Omegex. Noticing Uatu, Red Hulk shouts to him that he finally got his closure. Upon Red Hulk regressing back to Thunderbolt Ross, Uatu watches as Omegex ceased to exist upon it being unable to find Red Hulk. Iron Man later encountered Uatu upon his return from space as Uatu shows him the corpse of the Living Tribunal on the Moon. Hoping to procreate, Uatu began seeing the Watcher Ulana who moved in with him. After an unrevealed amount of time, Ulana became pregnant.

===Original Sin and death===
The 2014 &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline reveals that Uatu&#x27;s father was the Watcher who originally gave nuclear technology to the Prosilicans, and that Uatu&#x27;s observation of parallel universes is motivated by a desire to find the one world where his father&#x27;s act of charity was proved to be the right thing to do. In the beginning of the story, Uatu is murdered, and his eyes are gouged out, setting off a search by the Avengers and their allies for his killer. It is discovered that Uatu was killed by giant gamma-irradiated bullets, as were a number of varying giant monsters discovered by the Avengers&#x27; investigation in outer space, beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface, and in other dimensions. Nick Fury eventually reveals that he has spent decades in a secret one-man mission to single-handedly confront and kill alien, subterranean, and extradimensional beings that threaten the Earth, and that, with the Infinity Formula having been depleted from his body, he has experienced rapid aging and wishes one of the superhuman investigators who have confronted him to take his place before his imminent death. It is shown in flashback that, weeks before Uatu&#x27;s death, he came to witness Fury as his Infinity Formula began to fail, with subsequent flashbacks revealing that the Orb, Dr. Midas, and the Exterminatrix attacked Uatu and took one of his eyes, although Uatu survived the injury he received from Orb. Fury arrived soon after to talk to Uatu, but Uatu refused to identify his attacker and share the location of his missing eye due to it risking his oath. As Uatu began to gather his power for an apparent attack, Fury kills him, taking the other eye as he realizes that Uatu &quot;records&quot; everything he watches in his eyes. Following a fight with Orb that blew up Uatu&#x27;s house, Fury subsequently inherits Uatu&#x27;s power and position after using the power of one of Uatu&#x27;s eyes to kill Doctor Midas and becomes known as &quot;The Unseen&quot;, chained and watching events unfold on Earth, while the Orb merges with Uatu&#x27;s other eye, which appears on his chest. From a distance, a teary-eyed Ulana said goodbye to Uatu even though his body has not been found.

===Revival===
In the aftermath of the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, the Unseen uses his powers to bring the Cotati&#x27;s weapons to him so that he could learn how a pacifistic race like the Cotati had gained them. Once he began analyzing them, the Unseen realizes the weapons were created by the First Race and is overcome with energy as the one-eyed Uatu is brought back to life. When the Unseen asks how he is back from the dead and to at least say something, all Uatu says is &quot;There shall be...a reckoning.&quot;

While reconstructing his home, Uatu learns of how Nick Fury became Unseen by tapping into the Cyclopedia Universum. It revealed that three of Uatu&#x27;s brothers and sisters broke their non-interference vow by judging Nick Fury and fusing what&#x27;s left of Uatu with Nick Fury. After viewing some of the good things that Unseen did and the weapons used by the Cotati which caused Uatu to be revived, he states that the technology did not belong to the Cotati. While he cannot commute Nick Fury&#x27;s sentence, he does release him from his punishment by removing the chains on him since he needs an operative to get the job done and makes Nick Fury his herald. The first war is coming and Uatu states that everything and everyone is in peril as Nick Fury accepts his offer to aid him.

During the &quot;Reckoning War&quot; storyline, Uatu attempts to appeal to the other Watchers for help against the Prosilicans, but they reject his warnings, to the extent that his father forces Uatu to watch what he describes as the &quot;What If&quot; scenario he has never looked at himself; &quot;What If Uatu Had Never Interfered?&quot; Watching a world where he never alerted the FF to the coming of Galactus, Uatu sees the team suffer various injuries in battle with Galactus, including Sue being blinded, Johnny burning himself trying to knock out the Surfer, and Ben taking a serious beating. However, although he suffers damage from exposure to the energies in Galactus&#x27;s ship, Reed is able to analyze the energy Galactus feeds on and devise a weapon that unleashes a form of energy dangerous to Galactus, destroying Galactus and freeing the Surfer, Reed subsequently adapting that energy into a new power source for Earth. Uatu is horrified at this apparent proof that he broke his vow for nothing, and his father then leaves him to watch this alternate universe for the rest of his existence as punishment for his interference, while the rest of the Watchers remain resolved not to get involved in the coming war (unaware that Nick Fury is watching them and plans to take action himself). Fury is later able to release Uatu from the chair after showing him that the vision was incomplete, that timeline concluding with Reed&#x27;s new energy generator overloading and erasing the universe, leaving Uatu shaken but assured that his interference was right after all. Revealing that the Prosilicans&#x27; weapons were based on Watcher technology and they were responsible for the devastation of the Great Barrens, Uatu absorbs the power of the Apex- the centre of all power and knowledge of the Watchers- becoming the personification of his race&#x27;s power, allowing him to restore the Barrens to lively space after Reed Richards uses the Ultimate Nullifier to stop Wrath, the leader of the Reckoning, with the remaining leaders (as well as the one Watcher who knew the full truth and kept it from the rest) trapped in the M&#x27;Krann crystal as punishment.

==Powers and abilities==
As a member of the race of Watchers, Uatu possesses vast psionic abilities which have been further developed through training. These abilities include flight, telepathy, energy-manipulation powers, power-negating force-field projection, illusion casting, the ability to psionically alter his appearance at will, and highly advanced cosmic senses allowing him to be aware of countless events of Earth. His superhumanly complex intelligence enables him to monitor activities throughout Earth&#x27;s solar system simultaneously. Uatu can convert his body into an unknown form of energy while still retaining his sentience for travel through hyperspace, and then return to his physical form. Bolstered by treatment with &quot;delta-rays&quot;, Uatu possesses virtual immortality, although he can die by losing the will to live. He has shown he is able to transport himself and others through time, and in one issue he claims he can send someone to Limbo.

Watchers can augment their strength with cosmic psionic energy if they choose to; however, they tend to minimize their physical activities. The 1985 edition of the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; compared Uatu&#x27;s scale of power to that of Galactus, the Stranger, Odin, and Zeus.

Uatu received a highly extensive education in his youth on his home world. He has devoted himself to the study of Earth&#x27;s solar system and its sentient beings for millions of years. His home on the Blue Area of the Moon contains an enormous array of weaponry, artifacts, and technology created by various alien races from throughout the universe.

Uatu also studies the Earths of alternate realities. With permission from the Timekeepers, he possesses a portal through which he can observe alternate realities. He has acquired extraordinary knowledge of the history of both the sentient beings on &quot;mainstream&quot; Earth and the numerous alternate Earths.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate universe of the 1999 miniseries &quot;Earth X&quot;, Uatu is portrayed as a cold, nihilistic manipulator who feels no empathy for the people of Earth whom he watches. This is partially because he has been blinded by an Earthling, Black Bolt, and partially because the planet he is watching is nothing but the primal cocoon of an unborn Celestial, and the humans inhabiting it are mere &quot;antibodies&quot;, a natural line of defense for constant menaces. Also, Uatu (who watches the events on Earth from a base on the Moon) is the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu.

===Marvel 1602===
The 2003 miniseries &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; reveals that, although &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel&#x27;s superheroes more than 300 years early — speculated by Uatu to be the result of the universe trying to create the means to save itself from a temporal anomaly — forced him to severely bend his oath by communicating with the 1602 version of Doctor Strange prior to the latter&#x27;s death. Uatu&#x27;s deal with Strange prevented Strange from telling anyone else about the danger facing the world while he lived while allowing him to communicate that knowledge with others after his physical body&#x27;s demise. As a result, he must maintain a pocket universe containing the 1602 world within himself. The Overmind of the Watchers notes that, as much as they are ashamed of him, they are proud of him for saving the multiverse.

===Marvel 2099===
In the Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-96943, Uatu the Watcher was blinded by his fellow Watchers for his constant breaking of the Watcher Oath. He later created clones of the Fantastic Four. Though Uatu wanted to have them destroyed, he was talked out of it by the 2099 version of Moon Knight and the clones established themselves as this time period&#x27;s Fantastic Four. To enable the people of Earth in expanding into the cosmos, Uatu sacrificed his life to destroy the barrier around Earth that prevented this.

On the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, Doom made everyone forget about the Heroic Age and imprisoned Uatu so that he can inform him about possible threats to him. Doom would later kill Watcher when he served his purpose.

===Marvel Apes===
At the end of the main story in each issue of the 2008 miniseries &quot;Marvel Apes&quot;, a gorilla version of the Watcher can be seen telling stories from the past and trying to get around to a story of the &quot;Marvel Apes Age&quot;. In issue #2, he becomes drunk after drinking an &quot;Ultimate Nullifier&quot;, which he claims is like a martini, only mixed with &quot;Kirby Dots&quot;. In his drunken state, he complains about how boring it is to watch everything all the time. He also reveals that he is infatuated with the ape version of the Wasp. In his drunken ranting, he goes so far as to ask the reader if they &quot;wanna make out&quot;, then after realizing what he has said, apologizes and tries to explain himself. He usually tells stories that entertain him, such as the story of giant cowboy rat men and homosexual cowboy-apes, or the story of how Odin sentenced the Thorangutang to learn humility by becoming a doctor in the upbeat, rich city of Manhattan.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the 2009 miniseries &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, a version of Uatu witnesses the Zombie Spider-Man&#x27;s arrival in his universe. After being horrified by the nature of the infection, he decides to travel to other universes to warn others of the infection, but the zombie Giant-Man appears and bites off Uatu&#x27;s head, planning to use his communicator to traverse the multiverse and satiate his hunger. At the end of the series, Uatu returns, stating he was pure energy, and thus could not be infected by the virus. With Giant-Man unable to master his technology before Spider-Man found a means of destroying most of the zombies, Uatu then proceeds to trap the last zombie, the Sentry, in a time-loop paradox by sending him back in time to Earth-2149, starting the entire Marvel Zombies Saga from the beginning and keeping the zombie infection contained in these two realities so that it will &#x27;devour itself&#x27;. He eventually congratulated the Sandman for his help; Flint Marko had destroyed all the other mobile zombies by dispersing a nanite cure devised by Spider-Man.

===MC2===
In the alternate MC2 Universe, Uatu made several appearances regarding its last two miniseries, &quot;Last Hero Standing&quot; and &quot;Last Planet Standing&quot;. In the former, he briefly related the history of the MC-Universe; in the latter, he died while standing in the way of Galactus and his herald.

===Powerless===
In the reality seen in the 2004 miniseries &quot;Powerless&quot;, reality is turned upside down and is told from the point of view of psychiatrist William Watts, who in the very end is revealed to be the Powerless version of Uatu. Watts encounters non-powered versions of Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil, who face problems similar to their super-powered counterparts from Earth-616. Just as in Earth-616, Uatu finds that he cannot remain detached and watch as his patients&#x27; lives are ruined, and tries to come to their aid, but, like his original incarnation, he never acts directly, instead inspiring and guiding the heroes. He even watches the city using a telescope, before the last panel revelation that he is Uatu.

===Scarlet Traces===
In the comics story &quot;Scarlet Traces: The Great Game&quot;, he is shown in a cave drawing on Mars as one of the original inhabitants of the Moon, along with the Selenites from &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Uatu is not a person, but a highly advanced alien computer that observes everything. Ultimate Watcher resembles a stone totem of sorts with a glowing red eye. It is able to manifest in many locations at once. It has been observing Earth for some time and was present when Captain America received his powers. However, it appears that there is more than one Watcher in the Ultimate universe, for in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #96 Jean Grey attempts to find heaven to resurrect her father, only to be stopped by a Silver Surfer that is stationed in front of thousands of Watchers in a hive colony.

<text>Atomic Mouse is a talking animal superhero created in 1953 by Al Fago for Charlton Comics.

==Publication history==
Created by writer-artist Al Fago, Atomic Mouse debuted in Charlton Comics&#x27; &quot;Atomic Mouse&quot; #1 (cover-dated March 1953). The series ran 52 issues through cover-date February 1963. The Grand Comics Database notes, &quot;Overstreet has listed #53-54, but there is no evidence they actually exist.&quot;

From 1961 to 1962, Charlton published an additional five issues, vol. 2, #11-16, containing reprinted material and used as promotional giveaways. Another reprint issue, &quot;Atomic Mouse&quot; vol. 3, #1 (Dec. 1984) followed, as did a three-issue fourth volume (#10-12, Sept. 1985 – January 1986).

Writer Mike Curtis and penciler Charles Ettinger revamped the character in Shanda Fantasy Arts&#x27; &quot;SFA&#x27;s Atomic Mouse&quot;, which ran for three issues published from 2001 to 2004. The same publisher issues the one-shot publication &quot;SFA&#x27;s Atomic Mouse vs. Power Jack&quot; in 2009.

Fago went on to create Atomic Rabbit (a.k.a. Atomic Bunny) and Atom the Cat.

==Fictional character biography==
Cimota Mouse (his first name being &quot;atomic&quot; spelled backwards) is an ordinary mouse whom an evil wizard shrinks to the size of an atom. In that microscopic realm, Professor Invento gives U-235 pills that grant Cimota superpowers, which he uses to fight for justice against the evil Count Gatto.

<text>Tous () is a municipality in the Valencian Community, in the province of Valencia. The town is notable for the dam failure which occurred on 20 October 1982, when an unusually severe rainfall swelled the river Jucar, breaking the Tous Dam. The dam operator was unable to open the spillway gate, and the water overtopped the dam, which then failed, provoking a flood of 16,000 m3/s and more than 30 casualties. The flood was called &quot;La Pantanada&quot;.

<text>Virginia Louise Trimble (born November 15, 1943) is an American astronomer specializing in the structure and evolution of stars and galaxies, and the history of astronomy. She has published more than 600 works in Astrophysics, and dozens of other works in the history of other sciences. She is famous for an annual review of astronomy and astrophysics research that was published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and often gives summary reviews at astrophysical conferences. In 2018, she was elected a Patron of the American Astronomical Society, for her many years of intellectual, organizational, and financial contributions to the society.

== Life ==
Trimble &quot;grew up the only child of a chemist father and a mother with a flair for language, within easy driving distance of both UCLA and Caltech.&quot; While attending UCLA in 1962, she was the subject of a &quot;Life&quot; article titled &quot;Behind a Lovely Face, a 180 I.Q.&quot; The following year, she was selected to promote &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; television show as &quot;Miss Twilight Zone&quot; in a national publicity tour. She received her B.A. from UCLA in 1964 and her Ph.D from the California Institute of Technology in 1968. At the time, the California Institute of Technology did not admit women students &quot;except under exceptional circumstances,&quot; and she was only the second woman allowed access to the Palomar Observatory. Following a year of teaching at Smith College and two years postdoctoral work at the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy in Cambridge, Trimble joined the faculty of the University of California, Irvine in 1971, where she is now Professor of astronomy. In 1972, she met and 11 days later married University of Maryland, College Park Professor Joseph Weber, a pioneer in gravitational wave physics. From then until his death in 2000, she spent half of each academic year as a visiting professor at the University of Maryland. She was vice president of the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Executive Committee from 1994-2000, and vice president of the American Astronomical Society from 1997-2000.

== Honors ==
* She received the NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing in 1986, &quot;for informing and enlightening the astronomical community by her numerous, comprehensive, scholarly, and literate reviews, which have elucidated many complex astrophysical questions&quot;
* She was awarded the Klopsteg Memorial Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 2001, &quot;for her leadership, her contributions to the literature, and her dedication as a teacher&quot;
* She received the George Van Biesbroeck Prize in 2010, for &quot;many years of dedicated service to the national and international communities of astronomers, including her expert assessments of progress in all fields of astrophysics and her significant roles in supporting organizations, boards, committees and foundations in the cause of astronomy.&quot;
* She was awarded the 2019 Andrew Gemant Award by the American Institute of Physics (AIP)
* She was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020.
* The main-belt asteroid 9271 Trimble, discovered by astronomers Eleanor Helin and Schelte Bus in 1978, was named in her honor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 31 January 2018 ().
* She was awarded the 2024 Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics by the American Physical Society.

<text>Grito de Lares (&quot;Cry of Lares&quot;), also referred to as the Lares revolt, the Lares rebellion, the Lares uprising, or the Lares revolution, was the first of two short-lived revolts against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico, staged by the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico on September 23, 1868. Having been planned, organized, and launched in the mountainous western municipality of Lares, the revolt is known as the &quot;Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares)&quot;. Three decades after rebelling in Lares, the revolutionary committee carried out a second unsuccessful revolt in the neighboring southwestern municipality of Yauco, known as the &quot;Intentona de Yauco&quot; (&quot;Attempted Coup of Yauco&quot;). The &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; flag is recognized as the first flag of Puerto Rico.

==Causes of revolt==

In the 1860s, the government of Spain was involved in several conflicts across Latin America. It became involved in a war with Peru and Chile and had to address slave revolts in Cuba. At the time, Puerto Rico and Cuba also suffered a severe economic crisis because of increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish central government on most import and export goods. The Spanish crown needed the funds badly to subsidize its troops in the Dominican Republic.

In mid-19th century Puerto Rico, many supporters of independence from Spain, as well as others who did not support independence from Spain but simply called for liberal reforms, were jailed or exiled. However, in 1865, the central government in Madrid, finally attempted to appease the growing discontent in all its overseas provinces by setting up a &quot;board of review&quot; to receive complaints from provincial representatives. The board, the &quot;Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar&quot; (Informative Board on Overseas Reforms) would be formed by representatives of each overseas province in proportion to their collective population. The board would meet in Madrid and report to the Minister of State (Ministro de Estado), Emilio Castelar.

The Puerto Rican delegation was freely elected by those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners) in what was one of the first exercises of political openness in Spain. The separatist Segundo Ruiz Belvis was elected to the Junta representing Mayagüez, which horrified the governor of Puerto Rico as well as most of residents of the island since the majority of Puerto Ricans did not support independence from the rest of Spain. 

To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including their leader José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of mainland Spain-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested, including the measure on the abolition of slavery. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy, including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor. Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, once he became minister for foreign affairs in 1870, finally approved an abolition bill and praised the efforts of the Puerto Rican members, who were sincerely moved by Acosta&#x27;s arguments.

Beyond abolition, however, proposals for autonomy were voted down, as were other petitions to limit the governor general&#x27;s power over virtually every aspect of life in Puerto Rico. Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico, they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in Carolina, in early 1865.

Ramón Emeterio Betances, who supported independence from Spain and had been exiled by the Spanish government twice, was invited by Ruiz and attended. After listening to the Junta members&#x27; list of voted-down measures, Betances stood up and retorted: &quot;Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene&quot; (You can&#x27;t give away what you don&#x27;t own), a phrase that he used throughout his entire life to refer to Spain&#x27;s unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.

Betances then suggested an outright island-wide rebellion, with a proclamation of independence as soon as possible. To Acosta&#x27;s horror, many of the meeting&#x27;s attendees sided with Betances.

Frustrated by the lack of political and economic freedom, by the continuing repression on the island, all of which was caused by the extreme centralism of the Spanish central government in Madrid, an armed rebellion was soon staged by the pro-independence movement.

==Rebellion==

===Planning stage===

The Lares uprising, commonly known as the &quot;Grito de Lares,&quot; was a planned uprising that occurred on September 23, 1868. was synonymous with a &quot;cry for independence&quot; and that cry was made in Brazil with , in Mexico with El Grito de Dolores, in the Dominican Republic with Grito de Capotillo and in Cuba with El Grito de Yara. In Puerto Rico, a group led by Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis founded the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico () on January 6, 1868, from their exile in the Dominican Republic.

Betances authored several &quot;Proclamas,&quot; or statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish centralist system and called for immediate insurrection. These statements soon circulated throughout the island as local dissident groups began to organize. Among them, &quot;Los Diez Mandamientos de los hombres libres&quot; (&quot;The Ten Commandments of Free Men&quot;) written in exile in Saint Thomas in November 1867. It is directly based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted by France&#x27;s National Assembly in 1789, which contained the principles that inspired the French Revolution.

That same year, poet Lola Rodríguez de Tió, inspired by Ramón Emeterio Betances&#x27;s quest for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence, wrote the patriotic lyrics to the existing tune of La Borinqueña, Puerto Rico&#x27;s national anthem.

Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances, provided Mariana Bracetti with the materials for the Revolutionary Flag of Lares. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.

Secret cells of the Revolutionary Committee were established in Puerto Rico by Mathias Brugman, Mariana Bracetti and Manuel Rojas bringing together members from all sectors of society including landowners, merchants, professionals, peasants, and slaves. Most were &quot;criollos&quot; (Spaniards born on the island).
The Revolutionary Committee named twelve of their members as &quot;generales&quot; (generals). They were:
*Manuel Rojas, Commander-in-Chief of the Liberation Army
*Andrés Pol, Major General
*Juan de Mata Terreforte, Major General
*Joaquín Parrilla, Major General
*Nicolás Rocafort, Major General
*Gabino Plumey, Major General
*Dorvid Beauchamp, Major General
*Mathías Brugman, Major General
*Rafael Arroyo, Major General
*Francisco Arroyo, Major General
*Pablo Rivera, Brigadier General - Cavalry
*Abdón Pagán, Major General - Artillery 

The critical state of the economy, slavery, and the increasing political repression from the Spanish central government, served as catalysts for the rebellion.

The stronghold of the movement were towns located in the mountains, on the western part of the island.

On September 20, Francisco Ramírez Medina held a meeting at his house in which the insurrection was planned and set to begin in Camuy on September 29. The meeting was attended by Marcelino Vega, Carlos Martínez, Bonifacio Agüero, José Antonio Hernández, Ramón Estrella, Bartolomé González, Cesilio López, Antonio Santiago, Manuel Ramírez, Ulises Cancela. Cancela instructed Manuel María González to deliver all of the acts and important papers in regard to the meeting to Manuel Rojas.

Juan Castañón, a captain stationed in Quebradillas, overheard two cell members commenting that on September 29 the troops at Camuy would be neutralized by poisoning the bread rations. Given the fact that September 29 would be a holiday for most laborers, simultaneous uprisings would occur, beginning with the cell in Camuy, and following with the ones in various other points; reinforcements would arrive on a ship, &quot;El Telégrafo&quot;, and the cells would be reinforced by more than 3,000 mercenaries. Castañón and his men then entered González&#x27;s residence and confiscated the documents of Medina&#x27;s meeting and alerted his commanding officer in Arecibo. The cell leaders at the &quot;Lanzador del Norte&quot; cell in Camuy were soon arrested.

On another front, the Dominican government had supported Ramón Emeterio Betances. They allowed him to recruit a small army, and gave him a ship containing weapons. However, when the ship was about to sail, the Spanish government made its move. It prohibited the ship&#x27;s departure from Dominican territory. The authorities in the then Danish West Indies Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, where the ship was anchored, boarded the vessel and confiscated its cargo.

Seeing their plans disrupted, the other leaders feared arrest. They decided to change the date of the revolution for an earlier one without consulting Betances.

===Proclamation of the Republic of Puerto Rico===

The leaders decided to start their revolution in the town of Lares on September 23. Some 400–600 rebels gathered on that day in the estate of Manuel Rojas, located in the vicinity of Pezuela, on the outskirts of Lares. Led by Rojas and Juan de Mata Terreforte, the poorly trained and sparsely armed rebels reached the town by horse and foot at around midnight. They looted local stores and offices owned by &quot;peninsulares&quot; (Spanish mainland-born men) and took over the city hall. Spanish mainland-born merchants and Puerto Rican government authorities, considered by the rebels as enemies of the fatherland, were taken as prisoners.

The rebels then entered the town&#x27;s church and placed the revolutionary flag of Lares on the High Altar. This was the sign that the revolution had begun. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed at (2:00 am local time) under the presidency of Francisco Ramírez Medina at the church and the revolutionaries offered freedom to the slaves who joined them. President Ramírez Medina appointed Government officials as follows:

*Francisco Ramírez Medina, President
*Aurelio Méndez, Minister of the Interior
*Manuel Ramírez, Minister of State
*Celedonio Abril, Minister of the Treasury
*Federico Valencia, Minister of War
*Clemente Millán, Minister of Justice
*Bernabé Pol, Secretary to the President
*Manuel Rojas, Commander in Chief of the Liberation Army

===Battle of El Pepino===

The next day, on September 24, the rebel forces departed to take over the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino. The Puerto Rican militia surprised them with strong resistance, by moving troops from San Juan, Mayagüez, Ponce, and several other towns. This caused confusion amongst the rebels, who were greatly disadvantaged without the weapons provided by Betances.

The insurgents retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Julián Pavía, the militia soon rounded them up, and the insurrection was over.

===Trials and amnesty===

Some 475 rebels, among them Dr. José Gualberto Padilla (leader of the Arecibo cell), Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti were imprisoned in Arecibo, where they were tortured and humiliated. On November 17, a military court imposed the death penalty, for treason and sedition, on all the prisoners.

Meanwhile, in Madrid, Eugenio María de Hostos and other prominent Puerto Ricans were successful in interceding with President Francisco Serrano, who had himself just led a revolution against the monarchy in Spain. In an effort to appease the already tense atmosphere on the island, the incoming governor, José Laureano Sanz, dictated a general amnesty early in 1869 and all prisoners were released. However Betances, Rojas, Lacroix, Aurelio Méndez, and many others were sent into exile.

As a young man, Juan Ríus Rivera met and befriended Betances, and joined the pro-independence movement in the island. He became a member of the Mayagüez revolutionary cell &quot;Capá Prieto&quot; under the command of Brugman. Although he was studying law in Spain, and therefore had not participated in the Lares uprising, Ríus Rivera was an avid follower of Caribbean politics. When he learned about the failed revolt, he interrupted his law studies and traveled to the United States, where he immediately went to the Cuba Revolutionary &quot;Junta&quot; and offered his services. Juan Ríus Rivera went to Cuba and became the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the west after General Antonio Maceo&#x27;s death.

Mariana Bracetti moved to the town of Añasco, where she died in 1903.

==Aftermath==
Although the revolt failed to achieve its main objective, the Spanish government granted more political autonomy to the island.

During the years immediately following the Grito, there were minor pro-independence protests and skirmishes with the Spanish authorities in Las Marías, Adjuntas, Utuado, Vieques, Bayamón, Ciales and Toa Baja (Palo Seco).

Juan de Mata Terreforte, who fought alongside Manuel Rojas, was exiled to New York City. He joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee and was named its vice-president. Terreforte and the members of the Revolutionary committee adopted the Flag of Lares as the flag of Puerto Rico until 1892, when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee.

== Celebrated ==
While there is not an official El Grito de Lares holiday, the day is celebrated in the Plaza de Recreo de la Revolución in Lares barrio-pueblo every September.

<text>25 Martin Place (formerly and still commonly known as the MLC Centre) is a skyscraper in Sydney, Australia. Originally named the &quot;MLC Centre&quot; after MLC Limited, and still commonly referred to by that name, in 2021 the name was removed by its owner, Dexus, which now refers to the building simply by its street address of 25 Martin Place.

==Design and construction==
The building&#x27;s construction was controversial, since it brought about the demolition in 1971-2 of the famous 19th century Australia Hotel, the Theatre Royal, and the splendid Commercial Travellers Club building on the corner of Martin Place, all of which formerly stood on the site.

Designed by architect Harry Seidler, it stands at a height of 228 metres (748 ft) with 67 storeys, and remains one of his most definitive works. The building was awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal by the Australian Institute of Architects. The contractor was Civil &amp; Civic. It was officially opened by the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, in September 1978.

==Location and features==
The building is a stark white, modernist column in an octagonal floorplan, with eight massive load-bearing columns in the corners that taper slightly towards the top. It is one of the world&#x27;s tallest reinforced concrete buildings and was one of the tallest buildings in the world outside North America at the time of its completion. The MLC Centre was Sydney&#x27;s tallest office building from 1977 to 1992. The MLC Centre is wholly owned by Dexus, which acquired a half-stake in the property from the Queensland Investment Corporation in June 2017 and bought out its former co-owner, the GPT Group, in March 2019. The MLC Centre was also Australia&#x27;s tallest building for nine years until losing the title to the Rialto Towers in Melbourne in 1986.

Occupants include the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Sydney (TECO), Cognizant, Servcorp, and former Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. The podium of the building includes a shopping centre and a 1,186-seat theatre, the Theatre Royal.

The building underwent a $100m repair project which installed hybrid corrosion protection to the facade. The project retained the original appearance of the structure but remedied damage to exposed aggregate precast concrete facade panels caused by expansive corrosion of steel reinforcement. In June 2021, it was rebranded from the MLC Centre to 25 Martin Place.

==In popular culture==
The building was the headquarters of the fictitious &quot;Harper Mining&quot; company in the opulent 1980&#x27;s television soap opera &quot;Return to Eden&quot;.

The building was the centre of the storyline in the first episode of the Australian television drama, &quot;Police Rescue&quot;, airing in 1991. Sergeant Steve &quot;Mickey&quot; McClintock (Gary Sweet) is seen abseiling off the top of the building in the first half of the episode to persuade a man threatening to commit suicide not to jump.

<text>Charles Mitchell (22 May 1820 – 22 August 1895) was a Scottish engineer from Aberdeen who founded major shipbuilding yards on the Tyne. He became a public benefactor who funded notable buildings that still survive today.

==Career==
He attended Aberdeen University. After an engineering apprenticeship in London, he became a ship designer working for John Coutts&#x27; Newcastle upon Tyne yard in 1842. He became a shipbuilder in his own right at the Low Walker yard on the Tyne in 1852. The cable ship &quot;Hooper&quot;, second in size only to SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; and the first ship designed specifically to lay trans-Atlantic cable, was launched for Hooper&#x27;s Telegraph Works at the yard on 29 March 1873 after four and a half months construction. That shipyard joined in partnership with the Armstrong yard to form Armstrong Mitchell in 1882.

He was decorated with the Imperial Order of St Stanislaus, 2nd class (normal for foreign nationals), which may be seen in the coat of arms over the door of Jesmond Towers. Jesmond Towers, until 2008 the La Sagesse School, is a Gothic Revival building that was built in several stages in the nineteenth century. The main work is by the Newcastle architect John Dobson. In 1871, Mitchell was among those greeting the High Admiral, Grand Duke Konstantin at Newcastle Central station, after which the party drove on to Jesmond Towers. The Russian guests had come to visit the Low Walker yard and have a quick tour of the river.

In 1887 Mitchell commissioned the Art Nouveau church of St George, Jesmond from Thomas Ralph Spence (1845–1918), secretary of the Newcastle Arts Association. The building is tall and dramatic inside and of excellent workmanship throughout (commented upon by George Bernard Shaw on his visit in the 1890s). The stained glass is especially fine, and the mosaic figures were designed by Mitchell&#x27;s own son, C.W. Mitchell. The Lewis organ was originally provided with air by two powerful hydraulic engines supplied by Mitchell&#x27;s neighbour in Jesmond Dene, Baron Armstrong. In Jesmond he gave the land from the Jesmond Towers estate and £30,000 for the construction of the &quot;art nouveau&quot; St George&#x27;s church (1888).

Until his death at the age of 75 he directed the shipbuilding activities of Sir W.G. Armstrong, Mitchell and Co. In 1897, after he died, the firm became Armstrong Whitworth which is now part of Rolls-Royce plc and BAE Systems.

<text>Shoreline Community College is a public community college in Shoreline, Washington. It is located in a residential area east of Shoreview Park. The college contains over 80 acres and continuously serves 12,000 full- and part-time students. It opened in 1964 and offers degree and certificate programs.

== History ==

Shoreline Community College was the brain-child of Ray W. Howard, superintendent of the Shoreline School District. He felt that Washington state&#x27;s increasing host of high school graduates did not have adequate opportunities for higher education and &quot;actively worked with other school districts in the area to convince legislators of the needs of &#x27;non-traditional&#x27; students who could not, because of economic circumstances, attend the University of Washington or other four-year institutions.&quot; In 1959 he brought forward the idea of a community college in Shoreline.

Shoreline Community College started with evening classes in January 1964, accepting 806 student applications that would be taught at Shoreline High School which is now Shoreline Center. Howard &quot;retired as superintendent in 1963, and spent his last two years with the district planning and opening the new Shoreline Community College&quot;. 

&quot;The Boeing family eventually donated approximately 83 acres on a wooded bluff to Shoreline Community College,&quot; and the site was cleared for construction in the early 1960s. &quot;In the fall of 1965, the new campus was ready for students.&quot;

According to a study released in October 2013, Shoreline Community College is the best value for an associate degree in the state of Washington and among the best in the nation. As pointed out in the study, graduates are shown to earn $456,269 more in their lifetime than they would without the associate degree.

==Academics==
Shoreline Community College offers several transfer degrees and more than 100 professional, technical, and workforce training degrees and certificates, some short-term, others taking up to two years to complete. Shoreline Community College has international students enrolled from 45 countries. Over 140 scholarships are awarded annually, as well as over $14.4 million in financial aid.

=== National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium ===
In 2006 Shoreline Community College was recognized as one of 27 colleges nationwide to offer NAFTC&#x27;s alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) training and outreach center. The school&#x27;s automotive program has received statewide recognition for its specialized program.

== Library ==
The library on campus was one of the first three buildings to be constructed when the college was founded. In 1981 the library was named in honor of Ray W. Howard near the time of the founding superintendent&#x27;s retirement. It was remodeled in late 2016 and early 2017. 

The Ray Howard Library has a print collection that includes nonfiction, reference, foreign language materials, an ESL collection, journals, magazines, and a small popular books section with some graphic novels. While the print collection is supportive of Shoreline Community College&#x27;s curriculum, the digital resources include academic and trade journals, magazine and newspaper articles, e-books, reference books, and streaming video. The librarians teach workshops, consultations, and individual sessions to students and others who are learning the research process. Ray W. Howard participates in the online chat collaborative service, Ask WA which ensures that students have a way to ask questions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

<doc id="707688" wikidata="Q3302404" url="?curid=707688" title="Charles Henry Allan Bennett">
<text>Charles Henry Allan Bennett (8 December 1872 – 9 March 1923) was an English Buddhist and former member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He was an early friend and influential teacher of occultist Aleister Crowley.

Bennett received the name Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya at his ordination as a Buddhist monk and spent years studying and practising Buddhism in the East. He was the second Englishman to be ordained as a Buddhist monk (Bhikkhu) of the Theravāda tradition and was instrumental in introducing Buddhism in England. He established the first Buddhist Mission in the United Kingdom and sought to spread the light of Dhamma to the West. Co-founder of international Buddhist organisations and publications, he was an influential Buddhist advocate of the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Allan Bennett was born in London on 8 December 1872, his full name at birth was Charles Henry Allan Bennett. His only sister, Charlotte Louise was born in Brighton about a year before. His childhood was difficult and filled with suffering. His father died when he was still a boy, and his mother struggled to support the family, who nevertheless raised him as a strict Roman Catholic. During his youth he was plagued with bouts of acute asthma, which were debilitating even for weeks at a time.

According to Crowley, he had early experiences of an &quot;unseen world&quot;. As a young boy, about the age of 8, he overheard some gossip among superstitious servants, that if you recite the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; backwards, the Devil would appear. Bennett went into the back garden to perform the invocation and something happened which frightened him. At sixteen he was disgusted at a discussion of childbirth, becoming furious he stated, &quot;children were brought to earth by angels&quot;. After being confronted with a manual of obstetrics, accepting the facts, he said: &quot;Did the Omnipotent God whom he had been taught to worship devise so revolting and degrading a method of perpetuating the species? Then this God must be a devil, delighting in loathsomeness.&quot; At this moment he lost his belief in God and relinquished his faith announcing himself an &#x27;agnostic&#x27;. In his personal biographical notes on Bennett, Crowley once stated &quot;Allan never knew joy; he disdained and distrusted pleasure from the womb.&quot;

Bennett&#x27;s father had been a civil and electrical engineer, following in his footsteps Bennett was a keen natural scientist. Bennett was educated at The Colonial College at Hollesey Bay, Suffolk, and later at Bath, England, with keen interest in Chemistry and Physics. Upon leaving school, he trained as an analytical chemist and achieved some success in that field. Bennett also conducted his own experiments, while no inventions or patents were fruitful at the time. Possibly true, in a fictional work Crowley depicts Bennett as working on one process &quot;trying to make rubies from ruby dust&quot; also stating a precisely similar process was in commercial use by others only years later. Bennett was eventually employed by Bernard Dyer, a London-based public analyst and consulting chemist with an international reputation. Dyer was also an official analyst to the London Corn Trade and invited Bennett to participate in an expedition to Africa. Bennett in the end turned down the offer to go, and stated to an occultist colleague and friend Frederick Leigh Gardner that he was rather glad for this because he could focus on furthering his esoteric practices. It is said that Bennett was Bernard Dyer&#x27;s most promising student, though his shocking health prevented him from holding a job. Bennett also inquired of Gardner, if he could obtain a teaching position in chemistry or electrical science at local day schools. His electrical knowledge was profound, extending into the &quot;higher branches of Electricity, Hertz waves, Röntgen rays, etc.&quot;: this and his talent for experimental science, mathematics and physics would stay with him throughout his life. Cassius Pereira mentions that Bennett had &quot;done much electrical work, which was just coming to fruition, when his health broke down...&quot;. 

Bennett&#x27;s constant sickness created a heavy lens of suffering towards life. He was disenchanted towards the illusions of pleasure and love and saw these as the hidden enemy of mankind binding each being to the curse of existence. 

==Search for spiritual truth==

Having left Catholicism in his teens, Bennett was still in search to fill the void that had formed from this parting as he ever wished to find his place in the spiritual spectrum. Having a heart and intellect that sought cause and effect, analytical knowledge and wisdom, he wanted to apply scientific analysis to religion and uncover true spiritual gnosis. When Bennett was eighteen he fell in love with Sir Edwin Arnolds&#x27; book The Light of Asia (1879), which at the time was said to cause &quot;an enormous upsurge in awareness of, and interest in, Buddhism&quot;. This was a real turning point in Bennett&#x27;s life, and made a revolutionary impression that lasted his lifetime. He was so deeply moved by the pure and rational faith experienced through Arnold&#x27;s poetry. This religious experience lead the way for Bennett to develop a closer association with the existing English translations of Buddhist Scriptures. Thus at this tender age of eighteen, having been inspired by &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, Bennett announced himself a Buddhist by Faith. 

Biographer Elizabeth J. Harris states Bennett &quot;was a man of his time, born when the British Empire was at the height of its power and the wish to probe new religious pathways was gripping many young minds.&quot; Bennett searching for the height of Ultimate Truth, sought to find spiritual realization through the doors of religious and mystical practices and teachings available to him. One notable experience that occurred, also at the age of eighteen, where all at once Bennett spontaneously attained to the cosmic yogic state of annihilation &quot;Shivadarshana&quot;, literally meaning &quot;to have sight of Siva.&quot; Even though he was immediately thrown out, Crowley comments it was &quot;a marvel that Allan survived&quot;. Even after years of hard practice the effect on him was transformative, he said to himself referring to that lofty state: &quot;This is the only thing worthwhile, I will do nothing else in all my life but find out how to get back to it.&quot; Crowley further noted &quot;It is a marvel that Allan survived and kept his reason,&quot; as this extraordinarily high state of yogic attainment can be dangerous, a potential cause for madness. Crowley further explained the cross reference that &quot;Shivadarshana&quot; is the same experience as one of the formless arupa jhana&#x27;s in Buddhism. 

On 24 March 1893, Bennett applied to join the Theosophical Society. This society was a known path to spiritual exploration covering mystical traditions from east to west; yoga, religion and the esoteric and exoteric were all seen as things to be studied and practised. Notable also that the founders both had declared themselves as Buddhist in Ceylon in 1880.

Shortly before his 21st birthday in November 1893, Bennett wrote a letter to F. L. Gardner stating &quot;I have been ill - had an attack of apoplexy, which laid the body up...&quot; going on to request a set of astrological Ephemerides so he could track back a horoscope of his exact time of birth. During his time Bennett also gave a lecture to the Lodge on Egyptian mythology. By 1895 Bennett had lost interest in the Theosophical Society and turned his full attention to the esoteric gnosis. 

==Golden Dawn==
===Dawn of the esoteric===
Bennett was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1894, taking the Latin motto &quot;Voco&quot;, (&quot;I Invoke&quot;). He quickly progressed through the grades, entering the Second Order as a 5=6 on 22 March 1895 and taking the Hebrew motto &quot;Iehi Aour&quot;, (&quot;let there be light&quot;). He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time. Bennett was one of the most luminous minds in the order and favoured mysticism and white magic rather than the occult. Bennett was almost wholly concerned with divine knowledge and enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers) seeing them as mundane and divorced from the unrealised but glimpsed heights of spiritual attainment.

After initiation into the Second Order of the Golden Dawn on 22 March 1895, Bennett was considered the most proficient second only to S. L. Mathers and attained extraordinary success. Bennett had high regard for Golden Dawn leader Mathers, so much so it is said that he was adopted by Mathers and took his last name on until Mathers&#x27; death. Notably he also helped Mathers put together an extended work the &quot;Book of Correspondences&quot;, a systematic grouping of esoteric symbols and numbers from around the world which Crowley later expanded into a book of Hermetic Qabalah: &quot;Liber 777&quot;.

Bennett at the age of twenty-three was already working on his own occult formula, which was seen as quite astonishing, one such popularised account was the esoteric ceremony he wrote for Golden Dawn associate and actress Florence Farr. The ceremony was rather difficult and detailed, drawing on antiquity, involved things like the Egyptian symbol of immortality, and harmonising the forces of Mercury with Mercury&#x27;s intelligence Tiriel, while working in the hour of Tafrac under the domain of the Great Angel of Mercury. Its purpose is stated to learn the hidden mysteries of art and science. With the second order of the Golden Dawn having over thirty members, in a period that was exceedingly orthodox, it is no wonder that his association with the occult haunted Bennett in later life. During this period Bennett was fascinated with the arithmetical subtleties of the literal Qabalah, and via his essay &quot;Liber Israfel&quot; we can note his poetic musing incorporating Egyptian symbology specifically on the 20th Major Arcana of Tarot, Judgement. Crowley recounts a humorous magical tale before their first encounter, where Bennett had created a consecrated talisman of the Moon to cause rain. To make it work it needed to be immersed in water. Bennett had somehow dropped it and &quot;it worked its way into the sewer, London proceeded to have the wettest summer in the memory of man!&quot;

Crowley had been in the same order as Bennett for over a year, however their first encounter was in early 1899 on the initiation of a new member into the order. During the ceremony Crowley became aware of a &quot;tremendous spiritual and magical force&quot; coming from the east; he knew it must be Frater Iehi Aour. After the ceremony Crowley was &quot;led trembling before the great man&quot; though he could not bring himself to say a word. In the anteroom an hour after the ceremony, Bennett came directly to Crowley startling him by announcing &quot;Little brother, you have been meddling with the Goetia!&quot; Crowley withholding the truth in shock denied this, Bennett replied: &quot;then Goetia has been meddling with you.&quot; Bennett it seems could sense that Crowley had been &quot;dabbling in malignant forces beyond his control&quot;. Crowley went home somewhat reprimanded and determined to call on Bennett the next day. Crowley later recounted &quot;He had spotted me as a promising colt, and when, using my opportunity, I made myself even as his familiar spirit, he consented to take me as a pupil. Before long we were working together day and night, and a devil of a time we had!&quot;

George Cecil Jones and Bennett were known to be Crowley&#x27;s primary teachers during his days in the Golden Dawn. Bennett, four years older than Crowley, was the more experienced of the two and continued on to be one of greatest influences and inspirations in Crowley&#x27;s life. The only other person that Crowley places on such an upper tier with Bennett is Oscar Eckenstein stating his &quot;moral code was higher and nobler than that of any other man I have met.&quot; Crowley found in Bennett a Teacher of spiritual gnosis and a friend in spiritual seeking, and found him to be an &quot;inspiration to work in white magic&quot;, further imparting &quot;he bequeathed to me a beautiful Garden, the like of which hath rarely been seen upon Earth.&quot;

===Poverty, chronic sickness, and accessing mysteries===
Soon after the meeting, Crowley was shocked to find that Bennett was living in a dilapidated apartment in the slums south of the Thames with another Brother of the Order. Crowley, deeply impressed with the man also pitying his situation, invited Bennett to come stay with him, now enabling the two light seekers to work together more fluently. Crowley organised a room for him in his Chancery Lane flat, &quot;and settled down to pick his brains&quot;, for he knew his reputation &quot;as the one magician who could really do big-time stuff&quot;. For days, weeks and months, Bennett trained Crowley in the basics of magic and tried to instill a devotion to white magic. Bennett was generally ascetic and reputedly sexually chaste, a marked contrast to Crowley&#x27;s libertine attitude. In a fictional work Crowley depicts Bennett&#x27;s disposition towards chastity stating &quot;He had an aversion to all such matters amounting to horror.&quot; Even though all early sources point to Bennett&#x27;s chastity, unfounded rumours seem to have circulated in later years in an attempt to smear Crowley. Israel Regardie, who was a personal secretary of Crowley&#x27;s for a time, agrees the rumours seem to be baseless, that he never heard anything from Crowley or any substantiated claim to suggest otherwise. Crowley had said of him &quot;We called him the White Knight&quot;, that there &quot;never walked a whiter man on earth&quot; that he was a harmless, lovable &quot;terribly frustrated genius&quot;.

In the preface introduction to &quot;Iehi Aour&#x27;s&quot; work &quot;A Note on Genesis&quot; Crowley states &quot;Its venerable author was an adept&quot; with the esoteric system of symbols, accomplished in harmonising them in himself (here referring to what would later be known as &quot;Liber 777&quot;). &quot;In the year 1899 he was graciously pleased to receive me as his pupil, and, living in his house, I studied daily under his guidance the Holy Qabalah.&quot; Crowley goes on to praise the &quot;ratiocinative methods employed&quot;, and that the methods utilised were indeed &quot;so fine and subtle that they readily sublime into the Intuitive.&quot; As to some darker occult experiments that Crowley dabbled in at Chancery Lane he made the clear and specific point that Bennett &quot;never had anything to do with this&quot;.

Crowley described Allan as tall, though &quot;his sickness had already produced a stoop. His head, crowned with a shock of wild black hair, was intensely noble; the brows, both wide and lofty, overhung indomitable piercing eyes. The face would have been handsome had it not been for the haggardness and pallour due to his almost continuous suffering.&quot; He went on to describe how in spite of Bennett&#x27;s ill-health &quot;he was a tremendous worker&quot;. That he has a vast, precise and profound understanding of science and electricity. Crowley noted &quot;He showed me how to get knowledge, how to criticise it and how to apply it.&quot; Also highlighting how Bennett had immersed himself in Buddhist and Hindu teachings for the purpose of spiritual insight. Crowley continued to relate that he &quot;did not fully realize the colossal stature of that sacred spirit&quot; and yet he was at once aware that &quot;this man could teach me more in a month than anyone else in five years.&quot;

At a time when there was no legal prohibition against drugs, Bennett was an experimental user of available drugs (with which he also treated recurrent asthma) and introduced Crowley to this aspect of his occult and alchemical researches. Furthermore, as a part of his experiments into accessing the mysteries of the &quot;subconscious and super-normal mind&quot; and &quot;the World behind the Veil of Matter&quot; it is alleged he even experimented with poisons once taking an overdose that would have otherwise killed another man, though he remained unharmed. While Bennett was soon to abandon the practice of such experimentation and uses, Crowley went on to a life of hedonistic addiction though always held Bennett in the highest regard.

Crowley also painted a grim picture of how Bennett suffered acutely from spasmodic asthma at that early time. Bennett would take one drug at a time (up to a month) until it was no longer helping then cycled through the other drugs available to him until he was reduced to using chloroform. Crowley recalled how even for a week he would see him &quot;only recovering consciousness sufficiently to reach for the bottle and sponge&quot;. After a brief period of being well the asthma would return again, and Bennett would be once again forced back into this grim cycle of existence. Crowley stated, &quot;But through it all the calm undaunted spirit walked the empyrean, and the radiant angelic temper ripened the wheat of friendship.&quot;

===Impact, influence, and change of view===

In a hallowing scene Bennett is described as &quot;calm, majestic, clearly master of it all&quot;, Crowley paints in detail the aura of the man, that thunders forth; &quot;instantly a ray of divine brilliance cleaves the black clouds above his head, and his noble countenance flashing in that ecstasy of brightness.&quot; Crowley stating how this picture of Bennett was the literal truth. That Bennett was one of the very few people that he had met &quot;who really could get ... the results they wished for&quot; in this esoteric field, for it is easy for most to get unwished for results &quot;madness, death, marriage&quot;.

Biographer Kaczynski states that Crowley took on the Adeptus Minor Grade motto, &quot;let there be light&quot; in Enochian; a translation of Bennett&#x27;s Hebrew motto &quot;Iehi Aour&quot;. This shows a clear reference to the influence of his teacher and friend. Crowley once remarked concerning Bennett&#x27;s powers: Bennett had constructed a magical wand out of glass, a lustre from a chandelier which he carried with him. He preferred this to the wands recommended by the G.D. and would keep it &quot;charged with his considerable psychic force and ready for use&quot;. As it so happened, Crowley and Bennett were at a party and a group of theosophists present were ridiculing in disbelief the power of the wands. It was alleged by Crowley that &quot;Allan promptly produced his and blasted one of them. It took fourteen hours to restore the incredulous individual to the use of his mind and his muscles.&quot;

Crowley states how he had hoped Bennett would establish the Order in Asia &quot;The Dawn was Golden when you met the guide, ... You took the boat that floated with the tide, To leave behind no track... I hoped that you would raise my magic Sword, Upon another strand.&quot; One of the differences they faced was that Crowley seemed to think that virtuous conduct could be bypassed, where Bennett went as far to insist it was the first founding factor an aspirant required, seeing the deficiencies in the West, namely the blamelessness of keeping the precepts. Crowley&#x27;s Autobiography is dedicated to three &quot;Immortal Memories&quot;, including &quot;Allan Bennett, who did what he could&quot;. Sutin states that Crowley tried to rekindle the connection, Bennett was the reluctant one and eventually the two of them did start to drift apart. 

Crowley notes years later &quot;Allan, strangely enough it seems to me, lost interest rather than gained it as we acquired proficiency in the White Art... He didn&#x27;t really care for Magic at all; he thought that it led nowhere. He only cared for yoga.&quot; Also while Bennett was a strong influence on Crowley&#x27;s early life and later thought, Bennett one day responded to Crowley &quot;No Buddhist would consider it worthwhile to pass from the crystalline clearness of his own religion to this involved obscurity.&quot; Years later Crowley&#x27;s reprinted Bennett&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Culture of Mind&quot;, likely without his knowledge, with the new name &quot;Training of the Mind&quot; in the Equinox series. Here it can be seen that their understanding of ultimate reality had taken separate roads, Crowley seemed to think the two paths compatible, while Bennett was unwavering in his religious zeal. On a sombre note, Kaczynski quotes what Crowley wrote down upon his friends&#x27; departure, now aware of Bennett&#x27;s change in path: &quot;O Man of Sorrows: brother unto Grief!&quot;... &quot;In the white shrine of thy white spirit&#x27;s reign, Thou man of Sorrows: O, beyond belief!&quot;.

==Travel to Southeast Asia==
===Ceylon, yoga and Buddhism===
At some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to Asia to relieve his chronic asthma, after submersing himself in the study Buddhism. He traveled to Ceylon as a self-converted Buddhist, staying at Kamburugamuwa in the Matara district for four months, Bennett studied the Pali language and the root Theravadan Teachings under an elder Sinhala monk Venerable Revata Thera. Cassius Pereira later recalled that &quot;such was the brilliance of his intellect&quot; that he had mastered that ancient tongue in six months and could fluently converse.&quot; Further that Bennett &quot;made many close friends amongst the Buddhists of Ceylon, who gave him much assistance in every way.&quot; Bennett also spent time visiting monasteries, monks and sacred sites, familiarising and immersing himself with the Buddhist culture and practice of Ceylon. 

In Colombo he studied Hatha Yoga under the yogi Ponnambalam Ramanathan (Shri Parananda) who was said to be a man of &quot;profound religious knowledge&quot;. As Bennett&#x27;s health improved, he served as tutor to the younger sons of the Shri Parananda, who was a high-caste Tamil and the Solicitor General of Ceylon. Florence Farr a prior Golden Dawn associate, was also to move over to Ceylon years later, and became the principal lady of Shri Parananda&#x27;s College for Girls. Bennett joined the Sangha under the yogi and took the name Swami Maitrananda, which was already of Buddhist significance. The psychic potency of the man become more pronounced as he mastered the breathing techniques, mantras, asana postures and concentration practices in an amazingly short time period. Crowley visited Bennett in Kandy, and personally attended on him during a yogic meditation retreat. Crowley supported his retreat by quietly bringing food into the room nextdoor to where Bennett was practising. Having missed two meals in a row, Crowley out of concern checked on Bennett finding him not seated on the central mat, but at the end of the room still in the Padmasana yoga posture &quot;in his knotted position, resting on his head and right shoulder, exactly like an image overturned.&quot; Crowley set him a right, and he came out of the trance quite unaware that anything unusual had happened. 

With his health improving in the warm weather, he was now free from the chronic cycle of drugs he had needed in England. Also, he had relinquished his experimentation into psychic and esoteric power. Bennett&#x27;s quest for spiritual meaning had finally been quenched as he began to commit to the practice and Teachings of Theravada Buddhism. Crowley noted Bennett was &quot;the noblest and gentlest soul I have ever known&quot;, and in spite of his teacher &amp; friend&#x27;s prior experimentation that &quot;Allan was already at heart a Buddhist&quot;. Egil Asprem states &quot;Following Bennett&#x27;s example Crowley also engaged in a more intimate relation with Buddhism during his visit and would subsequently consider himself a Buddhist for many years&quot;. Bennett later recounts &quot;The native, and correct, designation of the pure form of Buddhism now prevalent in Burma, Ceylon, and Siam is Theravādha, &#x27;The Tradition of the Elders&#x27; or, as we might justly render it, the Traditional, Original, or Orthodox School.&quot; His intellect, spiritual endeavour and faith sees this school as the &quot;pure and simple&quot; ... &quot;practically unchanged after twenty-five centuries&quot;, that its inheritance is not mythical but rather &quot;the actual words&quot; the Buddha employed on his &quot;religious mission&quot; that are still rolling down to the present.

In July 1901, Bennett gave a talk at the Theosophical Society in Colombo named the &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot;. Attending this talk was the young Cassius Pereira who was so deeply moved at this talk, it changed his life, and he became a lifelong friend of Bennett and later also took up the robes. Bennett, at this time decided he would lead a Buddhist Mission to England. To do this he realised it must be carried out by a Bhikkhu of the Buddha&#x27;s Sangha, thus seeing the limitations in Ceylon he set his vision on Higher Ordination in the Theravada Buddhist Order of monks in Burma. He had come to the see that the path of renunciation, was the only path for him, the more he studied and practised the more he was attracted to it.

===Out of darkness into the light===

Bennett travelled to the coastal city of Akyab at took up residence at the Buddhist monastery, the Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung. Bennett was accepted into the Order by Lamrna Saradaw as a &quot;Samanera&quot; (novice monk) on 8 December 1901. During this time he spent his time learning and improving further his knowledge of Pali, learning the duties of a Buddhist Monk and writing Buddhist papers for a publication Ceylon. Half a year later, on Vesak Day the Full Moon May 1902, a long line of seventy-four Buddhist monks proceed from Kyarook Kyoung towards the wharf edge for the new Samanera&#x27;s Higher Ordination. The ceremony was taken place on the water, presided by Sheve Bya Sayadaw, and it is here that he moved from the ten precepts of a novice to the 227 precepts of a Buddhist Bhikkhu. Still unacquainted with the Burmese tongue, Shwe Zedi Saradaw translated each sentence into English, likely the first occurrence of this happening in history. His ordination name was Ananda Maitreya, a Sanskrit name, soon to be changed to the Pali rendition Ananda Metteyya to be inline with the Theravada roots, which means &quot;Bliss of loving kindness&quot;. Ananda was also the name of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s attendant, and the Sanskrit Maitreya and the Pali Metteyya are the name of the coming Buddha stated in the suttas. With fresh vigour he addressed the Sangha at this auspicious ceremony, outlining how he intended to help spread Buddhism to the West. He spoke of the conflicts that were forming due to the clash of science and religion, and spoke of a vision of bringing to the West that shining faith and Path of the Buddha that he had first truly experienced in Ceylon. Crow quotes him as stating &quot;Herein, then, lies the work that is before me&quot;, that his purpose is to &quot;carry to the Lands of the West the Law of Love and Truth&quot; declared by the Buddha, to establish a Sangha of Bhikkhus in his name. Metteyya filled with zeal closes the speech with: &quot;bringing from the East even unto the West, the splendour of a Dawn beyond our deepest conception; bringing joy from sorrow, and out of Darkness, LIGHT.&quot;

Metteyya was the second known Englishman to be ordained as a Bhikkhu, after Gordon Douglas who was ordained in Ceylon 1899. During Metteyya&#x27;s ordination speech he made an earnest call to &quot;countrymen ... who will come to the East, and receive the requisite Ordination, and acquire a thorough knowledge of the Dharma&quot; to help teach the West, &quot;this work I have already commenced on a small scale.&quot; Harris states Metteyya made a &quot;call for five men from four countries to come to Burma to be trained for higher ordination.&quot; One such German man, who may have heard this call, travelled to find Metteyya and soon ordained as a novice, staying on with Metteyya for a month. The sāmaṇera then went to Kyundaw monastery, which was nearby boarding the forest, and in February 1904 was accepted into the Sangha as Ñāṇatiloka Bhikkhu, the first known continental European to receive higher ordination. He was later grateful for meeting the supporters of Metteyya and made use at one point of the hut that had been built for Metteyya. Harris holds a letter from 10 February 1905, were Metteyya is commending Ñāṇatiloka asking Cassius Perera if he would help him further stating &quot;he is an easily-contented mortal, with a very gentle and considerate nature&quot;. Ñāṇatiloka went on to become the father of western monks in Ceylon.

===Brotherly bonds of all mankind===
In Rangoon 1903, Metteyya and Ernest Reinhold Rost co-founded the International Buddhist Society known as Buddhasāsana Samāgama. It was an &quot;international Buddhist society that aimed at the global networking of Buddhists.&quot; Its motto was &quot;Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti&quot; meaning &quot;The Gift of Truth Excels All Gifts&quot; taken from the Dhammapada v. 354. Metteyya was Secretary General and made Edwin Arnold, the man who was the first to illuminate the Buddhas Path to him with the Light of Asia, the first honorary member of the Society. Harris goes on to state that &quot;Buddhasāsana Samāgama gained official representatives in Austria, Burma, Ceylon, China, Germany, Italy, America, and England.&quot; Enthusiasm and greetings began to pour in from all around the world. His friend Cassius Pereira (who later entered the Sangha, becoming Bhikkhu Kassapa in 1947 at the Vajiraramaya Temple) referring to this period recalls that Metteyya gave several &quot;inspiring addresses from the Maitriya Hall&quot;. Pereira&#x27;s Father built Maitriya Hall at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya in honour of Ānanda Metteyya, its related group &#x27;Servants of the Buddha&#x27; has been active down to the 21st century. 
The Buddhasāsana Samāgama garnered an immediate interest, with three hundred attendees at a Conversazione in Rangoon, a few months after its inception. In September 1903, whilst still in Rangoon, Metteyya began a periodical called &quot;Buddhism: An Illustrated Review&quot;. Metteyya was instrumental in its production and appears in the prospectus with Dr. Ross as secretary-general. The Quarterly Review was really the heart pulse of the society, which was sent to all Members without additional cost and &quot;sold to the General Public at three shillings a copy&quot;. However, funding was difficult and further the work was often delayed due to Metteyya&#x27;s sickness. Metteyya avidly contributed to each addition, for example some of his first works were &quot;In the Shadow of Shwe Dagon&quot;, &quot;Nibbāṇa&quot;, &quot;Transmigration&quot; &amp; &quot;The Law of Righteousness&quot;. Buddhasāsana Samāgama also notably printed its constitution and rules in Volume 1 Issue 2.

During this time Albert Edmunds helped to promote the journal, he too openly hoped for a synthesis between the east and the west. Edmunds acceptance of the position of America representative to the Society, was more humanitarian &quot;I have taken this Rangoon representativeship so as to be useful and justify my existence.&quot; Further explaining &quot;I am not a Buddhist, but a philosopher who believes that a knowledge of Buddhism will liberalize Christianity ...&quot; Tweed further explaining Edmund&#x27;s rationale &quot;it seemed to be capable of broadening Christianity and fusing cultures.&quot; So Edmunds became the person of note in North America and at the same time Anagarika Dharmapala and one J. F. McKechnie became inspired after reading Metteyya&#x27;s article &#x27;Nibbana&#x27;. McKechnie stated &quot;It seemed to me couched in a fine style of English and moderate, rational, clear and convincing in its argument&quot;, he was inspired and moved, saying &quot;It hit me where I lived&quot;. McKechnie soon answered and appeal and became sub-editor of the journal, and within some years had himself left to Burma to become Bhikkhu Sīlācāra.

While fitful due to Metteyya&#x27;s illness, the &quot;Illustrated Review&quot; was considered a success. Thought pioneer James Allen (author of As a Man Thinketh), Rhys Davis, Shwe Zan Aung, Paul Carus, J. F. M&#x27;Kechnie, Cassius Pereira and Maung Khin (barrister from Rangoon whom was later a Chief Justice of the High Court) are some of the contributing authors in the first few publications. Mrs. Hla Oung who was the sponsor of Metteyya hut in Ceylon, who was daughter of the late Sitkegyi Oo Tawlay, wife of Oo Hla Oung (Controller of the Indian Treasuries), also appears in the first issue in an article entitled &quot;The Women of Burma&quot;.

Due to said distributions there were only six issues of &quot;Buddhism&quot; printed between 1903 and 1908. Harris details the principles underlining the missionary and international vision outlined in the first issue. One, &quot;to set before the world the true principles of our Religion&quot; to give rise to &quot;wide-spread acceptance among the peoples of the West&quot; its true practice as a vehicle to promote general happiness. Two and three set to encourage wholehearted humanitarian activities and to further those interested in ever growing numbers to unite under common brotherly bonds of all mankind in alignment with True Buddhist ideals.

By December 2003, Volume 1 Issue 2 stated &quot;Some five hundred copies of our first number were sent gratuitously to the Press, Libraries, Universities and other institutions in the West&quot; so that the real work of spreading the light to the West was well underway. Metteyya continued to maintain a high level of international contact and by 1904, thanks to the generous supporters in Burma, the periodical was appearing on the reading table of 500 to 600 libraries across Europe. Christmas Humphreys states that the first issue appeared in September 1903, and the &quot;production and quality of contents&quot; was &quot;the most remarkable Buddhist publication in English which has yet appeared&quot;, that ramifications of this and the ensuing five issues was immense.

==Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland==
R. J. Jackson, who with the help of a fellow friend and Buddhist R. J. Pain founded &#x27;The Buddhist Society of England&#x27;. With the help of Ernest Reinhold Rost the three of them set up a bookshop at 14 Bury Street, Bloomsbury, close to the British Museum, and would promote the Societies cause by placing Buddhist literature for sale in store front window to encourage interest. Rost actively lectured in private congregations and the group soon started to garner support. A portable platform was painted in luminous orange bearing the words &quot;The Word of the Glorious Buddha is sure and everlasting&quot; and used in parks for lectures also gathering a considerable audience. Humphreys referring to Jackson also states &quot;In 1906 the first English practising Buddhist began to lecture on Buddhism from the traditional soap box in Hyde Park.&quot;

Francis Payne mentions on his way to the British Museum he noticed the Buddhist leaning bookshop. Furious he went in and stated, &quot;Why are you bringing this superstition to England?&quot;. One of them asked him not to be in a hurry and suggested he read one of the books, presenting him with &quot;Lotus Blossoms&quot;, by Bhikkhu Sīlacāra. Soon after Payne was himself giving Dhamma lectures and became an integral part of the Society. It is said that Francis Payne went on to be the greatest Buddhist evangelist of the era second only to Metteyya.

Jackson and Pain soon got in touch with Metteyya, and preparations began to pave the way for his arrival, the time was now ripe for Metteyya&#x27;s vision to be fulfilled. On the evening of 3 November 1907, a meeting commenced at Harley Street, London. Some twenty-five people had attended, the result of this meeting &#x27;The Buddhist Society of England&#x27; was expanded to form &#x27;The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27;, which based its structure on its Rangoon counterpart. Christmas Humphreys later said its main purpose was &quot;to welcome and serve as the vehicle for the teachings&quot; of Buddhism to the West.

With its formation the King of Thailand became Patron and the eminent Pali scholar Professor Rhys Davis accepted the position of President. Professor Edmund T. Mills, F.R.S., Captain J. E. Ellam also took on key roles on the committee. This newly formed team of five was given the task &quot;of drawing up a provisional Prospectus, Constitution and Rules, and the convening of another and larger meeting&quot;. 

A few names of such eminent Buddhist followers were Captain Rolleston, Hon. Eric Collier, sculptor St George Lane Fox-Pitt, painter Alexander Fisher, The Earl of Maxborough &amp; A.J. Mills. Hermann Oldenberg, Loftus Hare (who went on to be a part of the Parliament of Living Religions), Sir Charles Eliot, C. Jinarajadasa, D.T. Suzuki and Mme David-Neel are further notable names of those who supported or contributed to the Society.

Bennett was associated with the Society, when health was able, throughout the rest of his life. Bennett was also a key editor of their periodical, &quot;The Buddhist Review&quot; which was founded in 1909 and ended in 1922. It was certainly challenging, partly composed of the religiously inspired, true converts, scholars, scientists, sceptics, agnostics and those who had to work hard to keep the Society afloat. Its headquarters in London, was seen as the oldest Buddhist organisation in Europe. Officially the Society was would up in 1925 and superseded by &quot;the Buddhist Lodge&quot; in London, in 1926. By 1953 it was known as &quot;the Buddhist Society&quot; and had relocated to its current address in Eccleston Square. Notably its journals have been &quot;Buddhism&quot; and The Middle Way and Christmas Humphreys was its president from 1926 until his death 1983.

==First Buddhist mission to England==
With the recent dawn of &quot;The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; Ananda Metteyya arrived on the steamship Ava with three devoted lay supporters at Albert Dock on the shores of England, in the United Kingdom, on 22 April 1908. Soon after stepping off the ship, Metteyya was questioned as to his purpose for coming to England, he replied &quot;in order to set forward the principles of Buddha in this country&quot; also elucidating that Buddhism blends harmoniously with other creeds, giving one clear example: &quot;its position as regards Christianity is that it supplements.&quot;

This was the first true Buddhist Mission to the West, the first lecture was soon to take place in London before the Royal Asiatic Society on 8 May. While circumstances were difficult, and public opinion was resistant at times, Metteyya&#x27;s personal charisma meant that he garnered &quot;golden opinions and the friendship and respect of all who had the privilege of meeting him.&quot; A historical account in the &quot;Voice of Buddhism&quot; relates that Metteyya &quot;began his work with great enthusiasm&quot; and that &quot;people came in large numbers to his Dhamma talks and meditation classes.&quot; Fifty years later Christmas Humphreys recalls that Metteyya &quot;brought Buddhism as a living force to England&quot; that it was the start of a slow growing movement of &quot;many to live the Buddhist life&quot;.

Christmas Humphreys also recounts his meeting of Metteyya on this inaugural Mission, in London 1908: with head shaven, the &quot;then thirty-six years of age&quot; Bhikkhu was &quot;tall, slim, graceful, and dignified.&quot; Humphreys describes Metteyya&#x27;s deep-set eyes juxtaposed against a slightly ascetic appearance, that surely Metteyya &quot;made a great impression on all who met him&quot;. The young monk was well-spoken, interesting with conversation and topic, with a pleasant voice, &quot;and in his lighter moments he showed a delightful sense of humour&quot;. Metteyya displayed a &quot;deep comprehension of the Dhamma&quot; and his wit of analogy by topic of science and his sheer &quot;power and range of thought combined to form a most exceptional personality.&quot; 

One magazine printed part of Metteyya&#x27;s writing in May 1908, &quot;Buddhism, ... with its central tenet of non-individualisation, is capable of offering to the West, to England, an escape from this curse of Individualism&quot;, recounting this a root to suffering. Ending he encourages the temperament of Burma to Londoners &quot;one learns to respect not wealth but charity, and to revere not arrogance but piety.&quot; There were many newspaper articles published in Britain and some abroad, mostly positive.

During this period the influential and prolific populariser of Zen Buddhism, Japanese writer and academic Suzuki Daisetsu Teitarō, met with Metteyya. Suzuki is later noted for his strong influence on such people as Edward Conze, Alan Watts &amp; Christmas Humphreys, further expanding interest in Eastern Buddhism.

While in London Metteyya was active in giving a number of lectures including one entitled &quot;Buddhism&quot; at the Theosophical Society, 10 June 1908. By September, he was meeting with members of the Buddhist Society every Sunday. All Metteyya&#x27;s industry and devotion to the cause, helped grow the Society&#x27;s membership considerably. Many of Metteyya lectures later appeared as pamphlets, in the Society&#x27;s journal or in &quot;The Buddhist Review&quot;. Metteyya and his devoted lay supporters, concluded the inaugural mission, leaving London to Liverpool on 29 September 1908, then travelling by way of ship back to Burma.

Christian missionary Rev. E. G. Stevenson studied Buddhism in Burma during this period and subsequently took up the yellow robes. The newly ordained Venerable Sasanadhaja went on to help Metteyya with his missionary work. Also in 1909, &#x27;The Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland&#x27; expanded its membership base to three hundred. 

==Teachings and declining health==
===Rescuing force of truth===

In a biographical account Harris reveals that Metteyya had pity and compassion for the hearts of the West. He noted the signs of great neglect in our culture such as &quot;crowded taverns&quot;, overflowing jails and &quot;sad asylums&quot;. To cope with this loss of religious and moral awareness he had laid down a three-fold agenda as a remedy. First to address this loss of moral awareness, so as to encourage the &quot;spirit of mutual helpfulness&quot; rather than the current curses faced by society due to such degradation. Second, he opposed three misconception about Buddhism: that it was uncivilised worship of idols, that it was &quot;miracle-mongering and esotericism&quot; and that it was a spineless, &quot;apathetic, pessimistic manner of philosophy&quot;. Third he had introduced his impression of Buddhism; as rational, optimistic, and that the Buddha was certainly a remarkable and enlightened Teacher.

Metteyya had highlighted the spiritual poverty of the West through his dedicated writing, with Theravada Buddhism presented as the force that could rescue it. Metteyya would give a range of teachings during this time encouraging others to see the benefit of virtue in precepts, with its opposing suffering, establishing faith in the Buddha as a foundation and even to develop the ability to recall past lives. The purpose for his teachings was to inspire but also to use these things to see into the suffering of existence and understand the Four Noble Truths as to personally attaint to the far shore, the goal of the Theravada Buddhist Teachings. With a simile of the force of required in by high-pressure steam in a steam locomotive, Metteyya encourages the aspirant to use the right skillful means of meditation to allow the mind not to flow out into the world, but to intensify the power of the mind in one spot, based on purity. He makes statements like &quot;Aspiration, Speech, Action, and so forth stand for consecutive stages in the path of spiritual progress&quot; inclining his audience towards the higher fruitions. He found light in the teaching that &quot;whatsoever phenomenon arises, it is invariably an effect produced by an antecedent cause&quot; giving rise to a profound understanding of the three characteristics. Metteyya goes on to use a comparative simile of what enlightenment is, then states it is the destruction of the illusion of self, the unbinding of the five Khanda&#x27;s of existence. That when that truth of liberation is reached it is &quot;Illimitable, the Element of Nirvana&quot; reigns supreme.

===Buddha&#x27;s message to the West===
On the 89th anniversary of the &#x27;United Kingdom Buddhist Day&#x27; on 16 July 1997, Tilak S. Fernando related the life, successes and struggles of Metteyya. He states that after returning to Rangoon, Metteyya was highly satisfied with the spiritual success of the mission though his health had steadily declined and the financial support for the mission was exhausted. While the Metteyya had found the Teachings were not broadly accepted with great enthusiasm, he was once again determined to push on to further the transmission of this Light. In December 1908 Metteyya wrote an &quot;Open Letter to the Buddhists of England&quot; earnestly appealing those interested in the Teachings to support the prosperity of the Society. At this time the Society had already swollen to one hundred and fifty members, and with all the graceful eloquence and inspiration he could muster, he posed the glory of the Buddha&#x27;s message as the answer to the immediate needs of the West. Fernando goes on to state Metteyya&#x27;s &quot;iron will to return to England was still alive, though the effort necessary to carry on with even routine work was terrible.&quot; 

To his further impact on the growth of Buddhism, Metteyya is referenced in organising the Western Wing of the International Buddhist Union, a group started by Anagārika Dharmapāla which later formed into the World Fellowship of Buddhists in 1950. Metteyya was also commended for his work in Burma encouraging Buddhism to be taught in schools. It is also suggested by Harris that the anti-Buddhist pressure in Ceylon had caused Metteyya to dedicate his time helping &quot;to equip Buddhist children to withstand the arguments of the Christian missionaries.&quot; This being a possible reason also for the waning possibility of a return mission to England.

===Murmurs and inmost shrine of Buddhism===
Crowley set to praise his old guru and published a newspaper article on 13 June 1908, stirring images of the brilliance of his old friend and teacher. First painting the surreal graphic details of ceremonial magic then going on to state &quot;How wonderful must then be the inmost shrine of Buddhism, when we find this same Allan Bennett discarding as childish folly the power of healing the sick, or raising the dead, of the attainment of the Philosopger&#x27;s Stone, the Red Tincture, the Elixir of Life!&quot;. Metteyya clearly having renounced his prior esoteric path to take up the &quot;white heights&quot; of spiritual Buddhist practice. &quot;What strange attraction must lie&quot; in the yellow robes of a Bhikkhu, &quot;the Begging Bowl, the shaven head, and the averted eye&quot;. Crowley goes on to rouse Londoners to a monumental illustration that this man has &quot;torn the heart of Truth bleeding from the dead body of the universe&quot;, that they who are hungry should seek his wisdom. That to all serious men who seek for real Faith, that this man has &quot;passed through all the ways of life and dead&quot; and he is attained, &quot;Latin Intra Nobis Regnum: Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya - Allan Bennett - is the man to help you find it.&quot; Crowley&#x27;s arousal of energy, probably purely motivated, was likely a key factor in Metteyya&#x27;s later character assassination attacks. Certainly his former life as an occultist and public admiration from Crowley would have added to the hype of murmurs and baseless accusations.

Dark suspicion over Metteyya&#x27;s controversial past and associations seem to captivated some part of the public. While his faith and practice was genuine, Metteyya still was a controversial figurehead. Both due to his history in the esoteric and his ongoing contact with friends in groups such as the Theosophy Society, meant the suspicion continued. In years to come these rumours were to amplify when Crowley was openly attacked in the media. This resulted in the names of both Jones and Metteyya to be dragged through the mud. Jones tried to sue the journal for libel which resulted in a drawn out court case. One news article said of Metteyya: &quot;the rascally sham Buddhist monk Allan Bennett, whose imposture was shown up in Truth some years ago&quot; is likely one of the worst examples of the accusations thrown about. &quot;Counsel proceeded to question the witness with regard to Allan Bennett, a Buddhist monk, and also a member of the Order, and it was at this point&quot; that his lordship Mr. Justice Scrutton remarked &quot;this trial is getting very much like the trial in ‘Alice in Wonderland,’&quot;.

No facts were certified in the trial, evidence was presented in a way that Metteyya was associated with the occult and libertine lifestyle of Crowley. This unfortunate public perception may indeed be one of a handful of causes in Metteyya&#x27;s waning ability for to spread the Dhamma through a further mission. The power of these stories and insinuations, really a form of character assassination, can be seen as some have even rippled down to the 21st century.

Metteyya had the full support of his close friends in Buddhist circles, Harris remarks that its worthy of attention several articles were run in his lifetime to help state he had given up his past and &quot;was not a man of &#x27;mystery&#x27;&quot;. One editorial stating &quot;There is no more mystery attending the Bhikkhu Ānanda Metteyya than any other person&quot;, Clifford Bax likewise stating from first glance the genuine nature of the man.

===Remembering backwards===
Metteyya in his early teachings and throughout his life prompted those he knew and taught to invoke a meditation practice that would enable the aspirant, firstly to remember backwards and ultimately to recall their past lives. Being one of the psychic powers used for realisation in Buddhism, he taught it as a tool to see that the continuation of rebirth in saṃsāra is suffering, enabling the aspirant to sharpen ones insight to perfect right view.

Alec Robertson, president and longstanding member of &quot;Servants of the Buddha&quot; the society that has run at the Maitriya Hall (Colombo, Sri Lanka), that was built in Ananda Metteyya&#x27;s memory, recalled that in a conversation with Metteyya&#x27;s close friend Cassius Pereira alleged having such a close connection with Metteyya &quot;that the two could communicate by telepathy&quot;, that each could know the others thoughts even at great distance. Biographers Crow &amp; Sutin also dive into the topic of Crowley&#x27;s struggling efforts following his old teacher and friends advice. Wild as it may seem to the modern skeptic, knowledge of past lives is described as one of the psychic powers that the Buddha realized on the night of his enlightenment.

===Digestible Dhamma and deterioration of health ===
Metteyya realised that the best path for Dhamma to arise in the West was through the Sangha of Bhikkhus, that this was the primary and indispensable foundation for the Buddha&#x27;s Truth taking root in a society. This honest realisation was stated in 1910, further in this letter Metteyya announced &quot;I do &quot;not&quot; think that the maintenance of a single Bhikkhu, whether myself or another, would, as things now are, at all conduce to that end. Quite the contrary, in fact.&quot; Here Metteyya was referring to the difficulties of establishing a Sangha of Bhikkhus that could flourish, while strictly adhering to the Vinaya.

Metteyya instead set forth the idea of the creation of Dhamma Literature that was constructed in a way that was easily digestible, broken into shorter fragments to be more suited to the modern disgruntled mind. &quot;The Dhamma, best for the deeper student in actual translations, is too archaic for the modern average man to start on. It needs &quot;interpreting&quot; into ways of thought, rather than translating into verbal likeness.&quot;

Metteyya&#x27;s earlier plans to establish a permanent Buddhist community in the West, in England, waned under his new understanding that Ven. Sīlācāra or himself would be unable to properly establish a Sangha in the West. This marked the end of Metteyya&#x27;s time as a dedicated Buddhist Missionary to England. Metteyya had stated that one who lives his true vocation of this life as a Bhikkhu, must follow the Vinaya accordingly to prove himself against temptations as a religious teacher amongst his fellow-men, to be wise and worthy so that he be a living example through the actions of his life. While Metteyya&#x27;s determination to return was great, his health was rapidly declining. Metteyya further stated &quot;I should be very sorry indeed to see the first beginnings of Buddhist monasticism in England founded on a deliberate and a continuous breach of the rule by which the Bhikkhu should live&quot;.

Speaking of the heart of Dhamma in this letter Metteyya states &quot;Now at this point I must pause to emphasise that our Dhamma, our Sasana, is the Truth about life, the Religion which comes as the Crown, as the Goal, of all religious teaching which has ever been given to the world.&quot; That we have learnt the &quot;fundamental movements&quot; necessary to follow what is &quot;Right and Truth&quot; superseding our &quot;mental baby-hood&quot; becoming &quot;self-reliant&quot;, endowed with &quot;personal responsibility&quot; taking up the mantle of the &quot;great pilgrimage of Life&quot;. Quoting the Buddha Metteyya writes &quot;Seek ye therefore Refuge in the Truth; looking on yourself and on the Truth as Guides, not seeking any other Refuge.&quot;

In 1909 Bennett&#x27;s early Qabalistic work &quot;A Note on Genesis&quot; appears in Crowley&#x27;s The Equinox, Volume I, Number II. In 1911 Metteyya&#x27;s Buddhist work &quot;The Training of the Mind&quot; appears in The Equinox, Volume I, Number V. Also in 1911, Metteyya publishes his a collection of his Buddhist articles: &quot;An outline of Buddhism; or, Religion of Burma&quot;. The latter was published in Rangoon, Burma, through the International Buddhist Society with an introduction by the Theosophical Society, later republished posthumously in 1929.

Burma&#x27;s climate was aggravating Metteyya&#x27;s asthma, and the austerity of the rules of a Bhikkhu was causing him to be weak. While the dates were not stated, Cassius Pereira mentions that he had gallstone trouble, had two operations and his chronic asthma had returned. Crowley states &quot;his life as a bhikkhu had not been too good for my guru&quot; his physical health was in a &quot;very shocking state&quot; including &quot;a number of tropical complaints&quot;. Metteyya&#x27;s doctors had reluctantly given him the advice to leave the Order of Monks &quot;where he had now attained the seniority of a Thera or Elder.&quot; In 1913 he had conversed with his sister, they decided it would be best if he moved to California so the better climate could aid in his recovery. In May 1914, Ananda Metteyya disrobed, no longer a Buddhist Monk, and with the aid of some local friends left Burma to return to England.

==Return to England and final years==
Arriving in England on 12 September 1914, Bennett met his sister who was to accompany him on the journey to America. Unfortunately due to his failing health the US ship medic denied his immigration visa. His sister sailed without him, and he found himself stranded, forced to live in poverty and illness in England. Bennett, now a layperson, was once again incapacitated with chronic asthma for weeks at a time and with the outbreak of World War I his situation was looking dire.

Though Bennett&#x27;s situation was bleak, all was not lost. A doctor and his family who were a member of the Liverpool branch of &quot;the Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; took him in for two years, though the strain was too great. An anonymous group of well-wishers ensured that Bennett was taken care of through support of the Buddhist Society, to save him from being placed in public care. As the help came in, from local and abroad, Bennett&#x27;s health improved.

==&quot;The Wisdom of the Aryas&quot;==
With refreshed vigour, in winter of 1917–1918, Bennett gave a series of six private lectures in Clifford Bax&#x27;s studio. With war raging, Bennett still roused his listeners to the sublime &quot;Nirvana stands for the Ultimate, the Beyond, and the Goal of Life&quot;, describing that our transient conditioned selfhood was so utterly different to what was truly &quot;beyond all naming and describing, but far past even Thought itself.&quot; Also encouraging householders to bring the &quot;ever-present sun-light of the Teachings&quot; into their daily lives. In May 1918, Bennett aroused the members of the Buddhist Society to fresh enthusiasm in what Christmas Humphreys described as a &quot;fighting speech&quot;.

Humphreys later cites Metteyya in his classic &quot;Buddhism&quot;:

Harris cites one account that mentions Bennett, though sick for weeks at a time, took over the editorship of the &quot;Buddhist Review&quot; in 1920, January 1922, being the final edition. The title, Arya meaning &quot;Noble&quot; in Sanskrit (likewise Āriya in Pali), refers to those who have attained to the Buddhas path of the four stages of enlightenment. Bennett then took the lectures he had given at Clifford Bax&#x27;s studio and used them as the main basis of his book &quot;The Wisdom of the Aryas&quot;, published January 1923. Included was one teaching on transmigration &quot;one of the most difficult of Buddhist Teachings to make clear to the western mind.&quot;

Bennett dedicates the work &quot;The Wisdom of the Aryas&quot; to his dear friend Clifford Bax, who hosted the lectures which were the basis for the bulk of the compilation. Bennett states: during the early &quot;terrible years of the Great War, I came to London, broken in health and despairing of further possibility of work for the cause to which my life has been devoted&quot;. This is the &quot;first-fruits of my work as published in a western land&quot;, thanking Bax for making &quot;possible the resumption of my life-work&quot; with heartfelt gratitude signed &quot;Ananda Metteyya&quot;.

==Death==
Clifford Bax recounts his meeting of Bennett in 1918: &quot;His face was the most significant that I had ever seen&quot; that one could both sense the twisting and scoring from years of physical suffering, and a &quot;lifetime of meditation upon universal love&quot; these gave rise to the most remarkable impression. &quot;Above all, at the moment of meeting&quot;, Bennett emanated a tender shimmering unwavering &quot;psychic sunlight&quot; that was a halo to his persona.

It was clear by early March 1922 that Allan Bennett was deteriorating rapidly. The suffering was plain even for others to see. Charles Alwis Hewavitharana and in all likelihood Cassius Pereira continued to support Bennett in his final days at 90 Eccles Road, Clapham Junction, London. Allan Bennett died on his native English soil at the age of 50, on 9 March 1923. Hewavitarana cabled the necessary funds for his grave in Morden Cemetery in South London. Christmas Humphreys recalls the event:

Lifelong friend and Buddhist writer, Cassius Pereira, wrote:
Paul Brunton, in 1941, shared that Allan Bennett had &quot;stimulated me spiritually and quickened my dawning determination to decipher the profound enigma of life&quot;. Brunton recounts his respect and honour for Bennett, leaving us with his thanks for:

Tilak S. Fernando on &#x27;United Kingdom Buddhist Day&#x27; in 1997 ends his speech paying homage to Venerable Ananda Metteyya&#x27;s legacy:
==Legacy==
Allan Bennett was a pioneer, and without him, Buddhism would not have entered the Western world as it did. In particular he encouraged and introduced the &quot;serious study of Buddhism as a spiritual practice&quot; into Britain, and further fostered its growth in Burma and Ceylon. Just before Bennetts death in 1923 the collection of lectures that had taken place in Clifford Bax&#x27;s studio plus and addition paper on Rebirth were printed in the book &quot;The Wisdom of the Aryas&quot;. Posthumously in 1929 the Theosophical Publishing House in India printed &quot;The Religion of Burma and Other Papers&quot; a collection of Metteyya&#x27;s writings from the first decade of the century a rework of the 1911 release. This latter collection subsists of the bulk of articles that have been published throughout his life as a Buddhist Monk, and as a devoted Buddhist. &quot;Rightly indeed have the Buddhists of the East decided that these inspiring writings shall not be consigned to the oblivion which overtakes back-numbers of journals, but made accessible to the world in the form of a volume.&quot; Many of his addresses and papers are still intact, available and in use today.

Ananda Metteyya is remembered for his promotion of Buddhist education in Burma and his central role as a figure promoting the global networking of Buddhism including the first true authentic roots of the Buddha&#x27;s Sangha in the West. Known both as a critic of the moral stagnation of the West and as a keen promoter of the beliefs of the East at the dawn of the 20th century. Metteyya was noted as one of the few early Western Buddhists who possessed reason, devotion and a strong grip of the Buddhist truths. Metteyya played an important role as one of these prolific forerunners &quot;who opened the eyes of their generation to an ancient wisdom long lost to the Western world&quot;.

Reiterated in the posthumous release &#x27;The Religion of Burma&#x27; the introduction states:

Metteyya was also noted &quot;by virtue of the literary skill&quot; to engage and share Buddhist thought through &quot;vivid expression ... the knowledge&quot; he had realised. &quot;One can hardly turn a page of his prose essays without coming across some passage which is instinct with ... imaginative expression&quot;. Metteyya&#x27;s passion for the Buddha&#x27;s Teachings as a way of life, his ingenuity and industry in bring that Light to the West, his example as a keen practitioner of Dhamma, all of this helped kindle a sense of spiritual urgency and seeking in those who crossed his path and teachings. His life work in summary was to share with the West the Noble Eightfold Path, the Majjhima-Pātipadā: that place of practice that avoids both extremes and leads to enlightenment, the total extinguishment of all suffering.

Tricycle Magazine also quotes Metteyya&#x27;s thoughts on the Buddha&#x27;s teachings:

<doc id="707700" wikidata="Q7548048" url="?curid=707700" title="Snoqualmie Falls">
<text>Snoqualmie Falls is a waterfall in the northwest United States, located east of Seattle on the Snoqualmie River between Snoqualmie and Fall City, Washington. It is one of Washington&#x27;s most popular scenic attractions and is known internationally for its appearance in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. More than 1.5 million visitors come to the Falls every year, where there is a two-acre (0.8 ha) park, an observation deck, and a gift shop.

Most of the river is diverted into the power plants, but at times the river is high enough to flow across the entire precipice, which creates an almost blinding spray. High water occurs following a period of heavy rains or snow followed by warm rainy weather. This can occur during the rainy season which lasts from November through March. During high water, the falls take on a curtain form.

For the Snoqualmie People, who have lived since time immemorial in the Snoqualmie Valley in western Washington, Snoqualmie Falls is central to their culture, beliefs, and spirituality. A traditional burial site, to the Snoqualmie, the falls are &quot;the place where First Woman and First Man were created by Moon the Transformer&quot; and &quot;where prayers were carried up to the Creator by great mists that rise from the powerful flow.&quot; The mists rising from the base of the waterfall are said to serve to connect Heaven and Earth.

The falls were first nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as a Traditional Cultural Property for its association with the beliefs of the Snoqualmie people. However, the property owner, Puget Sound Energy, objected to the listing. The falls were subsequently determined eligible for listing in the National Register. The owners rescinded their objection and on September 2, 2009, the falls were formally listed in the National Register.

In October 2019, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe purchased the Salish Lodge as well as 45 acres of surrounding land for $125 million.

==History==

===Ownership===
In 2007, the Muckleshoot tribe purchased the Salish Lodge and were transferred ownership on October 9, 2007.

The Muckleshoot planned to build a hotel, conference center, and 175 homes above Snoqualmie Falls. Members of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe opposed the project for its proximity to burial grounds and the Snoqualmie Falls. In 2015, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe launched the &quot;Save Snoqualmie Falls&quot; campaign. In October 2018, the Muckleshoot received approval from the Snoqualmie City Council to develop a 182-room hotel, convention center, and up to 210 homes.

On October 31, 2019, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe closed on purchasing Snoqualmie Falls, the Salish Lodge and Spa, the Snoqualmie Falls Gift Shop, and 45 acres of property north of and across State Route 202. The tribe purchased it for $125 million, effectively halting the Muckleshoot&#x27;s development plans. The Salish Lodge will, however, continue to be managed by the Seattle-based company Columbia Hospitality. The purchase was announced the following day on November 1, 2019. The tribe called its purchase a further effort to &quot;reclaim its traditional lands&quot; and &quot;stop irresponsible development&quot;.

==Power plants==

The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant is at Snoqualmie Falls, currently operated by Puget Sound Energy. It is made of two power houses, Plant 1 and Plant 2. Plant 1 was built in 1899 and operates at the base of the falls embedded in the rock below the surface. It was the world&#x27;s first completely underground power plant. Plant 2 was built in 1910 and further expanded in 1957, and is located a short distance downstream of the falls. Approximately 1% of Puget Sound Energy sales comes from the plant.

The 1899 generating system was designated an ASCE Civil Engineering Landmark in 1981.

==Namesake town==
The town of Snoqualmie Falls was located near the waterfall. It was associated with the Weyerhaeuser mill there. It had many structures, including a hospital, a school, community center, and many homes. When the town disbanded, many houses were moved to the nearby town of Snoqualmie. The 1940s and &#x27;50s film actress Ella Raines was born in Snoqualmie Falls.

==Hiking==
The top of the waterfall is less than from the parking lot, which has a gift shop, espresso stand, and bathrooms. The main views are from the side of the falls, with a fence separating visitors from the edge of a cliff. This area has picnic tables and benches, and a small grassy meadow called the Centennial Green, where weddings are performed through the summer.

Here, the river trail descends in 0.7 mi (1126 m), passing through temperate rain forest with moss covered Bigleaf Maple, Douglas-fir, Sword Fern and Salal and places to step off the trail and rest or enjoy the scenery. Heavy use makes wildlife sightings uncommon. The park does allow pets. At the bottom of the trail is the 1910 powerhouse, not open to visitors, and a view of the falls.

<text>Challenging Times was a television quiz show for teams representing higher education institutes in Ireland, both those in the Republic of Ireland and those in Northern Ireland. It was televised by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) from 1991 to 2001, sponsored by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and presented by Kevin Myers, then a columnist with that newspaper. 
The programme used a quizbowl format similar to that of &quot;University Challenge&quot; in the United Kingdom (Similar to the short-lived Australian version of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, the only difference is that the starter questions are worth five points, as opposed to ten on &quot;University Challenge&quot;), which is itself a licensed version of the College Bowl format popular in the United States. Each year, 16 teams qualified for the televised knockout stages, with two teams of three competing in each programme up to the final.

==Production==
Filming locations included RTÉ&#x27;s Studio 1, the lecture theatre of St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital and University College Dublin&#x27;s O&#x27;Reilly Hall.

The programme was cancelled after the 2001 series, at a time when RTÉ was in financial difficulties. 
The final of that series was postponed at short notice and an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was broadcast instead. 
Kevin Myers later complained that RTÉ had given &quot;The Irish Times&quot; no notice that the series was being discontinued, 
though RTÉ disputed this contention.

==Notable events==
The 1997 final was notable for its controversial ending. DCU led 175 to UL&#x27;s 170. Myers began to ask the final question: &quot;He was born in Australia in 1902, of Irish parents...&quot; The DCU captain buzzed in and answered &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; as the buzzer sounded to mark the end. An incorrect answer would mean a five-point penalty and a tie-break, but Myers ruled that the quiz had ended before the incorrect answer was given, and thus DCU won 175–170. (The controversial question actually referred to the writer Francis Stuart.)

==Finals==
===Roll of honour===

The Universities Act, 1997 substantially altered a number of third-level institutions, so this list unites the results of several colleges with their predecessors.

Other institutions that appeared on &quot;Challenging Times&quot; but did not reach a final:
*Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology
*Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology
*Garda Síochána College
*Institute of Technology, Sligo (Sligo RTC)
*King&#x27;s Inns
*Queen&#x27;s University Belfast
*Waterford Institute of Technology

<doc id="707704" wikidata="Q190531" url="?curid=707704" title="Fondue">
<text>Fondue ( , , , ; ) is a Swiss dish of melted cheese and wine served in a communal pot ( or fondue pot) over a portable stove () heated with a candle or spirit lamp, and eaten by dipping bread and sometimes vegetables or other foods into the cheese using long-stemmed forks. It was promoted as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union () in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s.

Since the 1950s, the term &quot;fondue&quot; has been generalized to other dishes in which a food is dipped into a communal pot of liquid kept hot in a fondue pot: chocolate fondue, , in which pieces of fruit or pastry are dipped into a melted chocolate mixture, and , in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil or broth.

==Etymology==
The word is the feminine passive past participle, used as a noun, of the French verb &#x27;to melt&#x27;, and thus means &#x27;melted&#x27;. It is first attested in French in 1735, in Vincent La Chapelle&#x27;s , and in English in 1878.

==History==

The earliest known recipe for the modern form of cheese fondue comes from a 1699 book published in Zürich, under the name &quot;Käss mit Wein zu kochen&quot; &#x27;to cook cheese with wine&#x27;. It calls for grated or cut-up cheese to be melted with wine, and for bread to be dipped in it.

However, the &quot;name&quot; &quot;cheese fondue&quot;, until the late 19th century, referred to a dish composed of eggs and cheese, as in la Chapelle&#x27;s 1735 &quot;Fonduë de Fromage, aux Truffes Fraiches&quot;; it was something between scrambled eggs with cheese and a cheese soufflé. Brillat-Savarin wrote in 1834 that it is &quot;nothing other than scrambled eggs with cheese&quot;. Variations included cream (&quot;à la genevoise&quot;) and truffles (&quot;à la piémontaise&quot;) in addition to eggs, as well as what is now called &quot;raclette&quot; (&quot;fondue valaisanne&quot;).

The first known recipe for the modern cheese fondue under that name, with cheese and wine but no eggs, was published in 1875, and was already presented as a Swiss national dish. Despite its modern associations with rustic mountain life, it was a town-dweller&#x27;s dish from the lowlands of western, French-speaking, Switzerland: rich cheese like Gruyère was a valuable export item which peasants could not afford to eat.

With the introduction of corn starch to Switzerland in 1905, it became easier to make a smooth and stable emulsion of the wine and cheese, and this probably helped contribute to the success of fondue.

Fondue was popularized as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s as a way of increasing cheese consumption. The Swiss Cheese Union also created pseudo-regional recipes as part of the &quot;spiritual defence of Switzerland&quot;. After World War II rationing ended, the Swiss Cheese Union continued its marketing campaign, sending fondue sets to military regiments and event organizers across Switzerland. Fondue is now a symbol of Swiss unity. Fondue is also often associated with mountains and winter sports.

In the meantime, fondue continued to be promoted aggressively in Switzerland, with slogans like &quot;La fondue crée la bonne humeur&quot; &#x27;fondue creates a good mood&#x27; and (1981, in Swiss German) &quot;Fondue isch guet und git e gueti Luune&quot; &#x27;fondue is good and creates a good mood&#x27; – abbreviated as &quot;figugegl&quot;.

Fondue was promoted to Americans at the Swiss Pavilion&#x27;s Alpine restaurant at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.
Fondue was popular in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, along with other foods made in chafing dishes.

The extension of the name &quot;fondue&quot; to other dishes served in a communal hot pot dates to 1950s New York. Konrad Egli, a Swiss restaurateur, introduced &quot;fondue bourguignonne&quot; at his Chalet Suisse restaurant in 1956. In the mid-1960s, he invented chocolate fondue as part of a promotion for Toblerone chocolate.

==Preparation==

Cheese fondue consists of a blend of cheeses, wine, and seasoning, although there are many variations, such as using beer rather than wine. Traditionally, the &quot;caquelon&quot; is rubbed with a cut garlic clove, white wine is added and heated with cornstarch, and then grated cheese is added and gently stirred until melted, although in practice all the ingredients can be combined and heated together at once. Some kirsch is often added. Fondue is very easy to prepare, even in large quantities. The cornstarch or other starch stabilizes and thickens the mixture. Additional wine may be added if the fondue is too thick; its acid and ethanol decrease the fondue&#x27;s viscosity. A fondue can curdle if the protein separates from the fat, which is usually the result of not enough liquid in the mixture and an insufficiently acid mixture, so lemon juice is sometimes added.

===Temperature and &quot;la religieuse&quot;===
A cheese fondue mixture should be kept warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not so hot that it burns. If this temperature is held until the fondue is finished there will be a thin crust of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the bottom of the &quot;caquelon&quot;. This is called &quot;la religieuse&quot; (French for &quot;the nun&quot;). It has the texture of a cracker and is almost always lifted out and eaten.

==Variants==
===Swiss===

The regional names used for some of these variants are factitious, and do not reflect genuine regional traditions.
* Vaudoise: Gruyère.
* Fribourgeoise, from Fribourg: Vacherin Fribourgeois à fondue, wherein potatoes are often dipped instead of bread. This is the only cheese fondue that does not use wine. The cheese is melted in a few tablespoons of water over low heat.
* Moitié-moitié (or half and half), also called Fondue Suisse: Gruyère and Vacherin Fribourgeois.
* Neuchâteloise: Gruyère and Emmental (sometimes referred to as the original or traditional fondue).
* Innerschweiz: Gruyère, Emmental, and Sbrinz.
* Genevoise: Gruyère (preferably of several stages of maturity) with a little Emmentaler and Valais cheese. Sometimes chopped sautéed morels are added.
* Interlaken: Gruyère, Appenzeller, Emmental.
* Appenzeller: Appenzeller cheese with cream added.
* Tomato: Gruyère, Emmental, crushed tomatoes, and wine.
* Spicy: Gruyère, red and green peppers, with chili.
* Mushroom: Gruyère, Vacherin Fribourgeois, and mushrooms.

===French===
* Savoyarde: two or three different cheeses including Beaufort, Abondance or French equivalent of Gruyère or Emmental.
* Jurassienne: Mature or mild Comté.
* Auvergnate: Saint-Nectaire, Cantal and Fourme d&#x27;Ambert

===Italian===
* Valdôtaine (; ) in Aosta Valley: Fontina, milk, and eggs.
* in Piedmont.

=== Prepared convenience food ===
Refrigerated fondue blends are sold in most Swiss supermarkets as convenience food and need little more than melting in the caquelon. Individual portions heatable in a microwave oven are also sold.

==Consumption and etiquette==

Fondue is eaten by spearing a piece of bread on a fork, swirling it in the pot, and putting it into the mouth. Some writers recommend that the dipping fork be used only to transport the food from the pot to one&#x27;s plate, not to eat from.

Losing a piece of bread in the caquelon is said to be penalized by buying a round of drinks, singing a song, or running around in the snow naked. This is parodied in &quot;Asterix in Switzerland&quot;, where a character is sentenced to be drowned in Lake Geneva after losing his third piece of bread. Other fondue etiquette rules include &#x27;always stirring in a figure of 8&#x27;, &#x27;not scratching the bottom of the caquelon with a fork that has no side on it&#x27; and &#x27;adding an egg and kirsch schnapps to the caquelon when the cheese is almost finished&#x27;.

There are various recommendations on the choice of accompanying beverage: some say white wine, others specify black tea. Some drink spirits during or after the meal, which supposedly helps digestion. Indeed, alcohol may provide short-term relief, but overall, it delays gastric emptying and prolongs perceived fullness. The delayed, strong feeling of fullness after eating fondue may be caused by phase separation in the stomach, the cheese fat initially floating in the stomach not being released into the duodenum, delaying fat sensing and satiation.

<doc id="707709" wikidata="Q918047" url="?curid=707709" title="Volkswagen Fox">
<text>The Volkswagen Fox was a subcompact car produced and designed by Volkswagen of Brazil and sold in Latin America from 2003 until 2021 and in Europe from 2005 until 2011, where it was sold as the city car offering. The Fox was produced as a 3-door and 5-door hatchback. There is also a mini SUV version called Fox Xtreme (previously CrossFox) and a mini MPV/station wagon model called Suran, SpaceFox, SportVan or Fox Plus depending on the market.

==Earlier use of the nameplate==
Volkswagen acquired the rights to the name in 1969, by purchasing NSU. The original NSU Fox was a motorbike first seen in 1949, and Volkswagen had subsequently used the &quot;Fox&quot; name in some markets for special edition Volkswagen Polos. The Audi 80 produced in the 1970s also used the name Fox on vehicles sold in Australia and the United States. The Australian version was assembled locally by Volkswagen Australasia Ltd.

===North America (1987–1993)===

The Fox was a variant of the Voyage manufactured by Volkswagen do Brasil and marketed by Volkswagen in North America as an entry-level subcompact from 1987 until 1993. Initially offered as a 2-door and 4-door sedan as well as a 2-door wagon, the wagon was discontinued in 1991 along with the 2-door for the Canadian market, the same year the 4-door sedan (as well as the 2-door, in the United States) received a mild restyling.
The Fox featured a longitudinal mounted 1.8L, 4-cylinder petrol engine, sharing components with the Volkswagen Golf — along with a 4-speed manual transmission for the standard 2-door and 4-door sedan and a 5-speed manual transmission for the &quot;GL&quot; sport model — an automatic transmission was not offered. There was no power steering available. The Fox had power assisted disk brakes in the front and drums in the rear. The Fox did not have an anti-lock braking system.

According to the U.S. EPA, the 4-speed manual transmission averaged on the new combined driving cycle with the 5-speed manual transmission able to produce on the new driving cycle. Under the old test protocol, the Volkswagen Fox was able to produce with the 5-speed transmission and with the 4-speed transmission.

Early models (1987–1989) featured the Bosch CIS-E also known as KE-Jetronic electro mechanical fuel injection, using an oxygen sensor to assist in fuel management. Later models featured (1990–1993) Bosch Digifant electronic fuel injection. In Canada, the Fox from 1987 to 1989 was offered with the simpler Bosch CIS fuel injection (K-Jetronic) without an oxygen sensor for the engine fuel management system.

Due partly to booming sales of the Passat, Jetta, Golf and the price of the Fox compared to other manufacturers at the time, the Fox faded out fast, making it a rare car - particularly so the facelift (1990–1993) models. Fewer were being produced for North America due to the lack of demand. Volkswagen also priced the car very low, to compensate for the ever more expensive German-made cars, and Volkswagen of America lost money on every Fox sold in the early years.

Originally, the Fox&#x27;s squared off front end featured sealed beam halogen headlamps; after 1991 models received revised sheet metal with flush glass headlamps (MK2).

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Fox name was used for a model based on the first generation Jetta. This was sold alongside the Volkswagen Citi Golf, based on the first generation Golf.

==Overview==

===Latin America===
In Latin America, the Fox was positioned between Volkswagen&#x27;s supermini models, the low cost Gol and the Polo. It was based on the fourth-generation Polo.

In Mexico, it was called the Lupo, due to the last name of then current President Vicente Fox. Volkswagen of Mexico dropped the Lupo after a short run of 2009 models, due to poor sales, and replaced it along with the aged Pointer and Derby by the VW Novo Gol. The SportVan was also quietly discontinued in Mexico in February 2010 due to poor sales, leaving only the CrossFox.

In November 2009, the new 2010 Volkswagen Fox was revealed in Brazil and later also in Argentina. The model was restyled again in 2015.

====Safety====
The Fox in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for infants from Latin NCAP in 2015.

===Europe===
The Fox was introduced to Europe at the AMI Leipzig Motor Show in April 2005, on debut in Europe, the Fox was only available as a three-door hatchback and with three engine options: the 1.2 L 40 kW (55 hp) I3 and 1.4 L 55 kW (75 hp) I4 petrol engines and the 1.4 L 51 kW (69 hp) TDI engine. The 75 hp engine is all-new, and the two others are inherited from the Polo.

It has a drag coefficient of 0,32.

The Fox was sold with a long options list to reduce its tag price, therefore letting the European customer specify the Fox to their liking. It did come with standard twin airbags and anti-lock braking system for safety measures. Upon its debut, the Fox scored four stars in EuroNCAP&#x27;s crash rating system.

In the European market, the Fox replaced the Lupo city car as the entry-level car in the lineup. Volkswagen stopped selling the Fox in Europe in 2011 and it was replaced by the Volkswagen Up until it was discontinued in 2023. Like the contemporary Polo, the Fox is based on Volkswagen&#x27;s PQ24 platform.

====Specifications====
==Variants==

===CrossFox/Fox Xtreme===

The Volkswagen Fox Xtreme is a mini SUV version which sets it apart from the standard Fox. Before 2018 it was known as the CrossFox. As is the case for other similar models, it is available only with front-wheel drive.

It is produced in Brazil and sold in Latin American markets; there were plans to export it to European markets to compete in the expanding mini SUV market (see Ford EcoSport and Fiat Idea Adventure).

This version contains mixed-use tires and a suspension raised slightly beyond a spare tire on the outside of the trunk.

===Suran===
A mini MPV/station wagon version of the Fox was presented in April 2006. It is named Suran in Argentina, Chile, Egypt, and Uruguay, SpaceFox in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, SportVan in Mexico and Fox Plus in Algeria. It is built in General Pacheco, Argentina.

Because of its 360 mm-extended tail (4,165 mm vs. 3,805 mm), it has a larger boot and more rear leg room than the hatchback versions. Its main competitors are the Peugeot 206 SW and Fiat Palio Weekend.

The initial version has the same wheelbase of , a length of , a width of and a height of . It uses the 1.6-litre engine, with power output levels ranging between , depending on the fuel version (petrol or blend of ethanol and petrol).

In 2010 and 2014, it was facelifted, gaining slightly enlarged dimensions: in length, in width and in height. It was discontinued at the beginning of 2019.
====Safety====
The Suran in its most basic Latin American market configuration with 2 airbags and no ESC received 3 stars for adult occupants and 3 stars for infants from Latin NCAP in 2019 (one level above from 2010 to 2015).

<doc id="707715" wikidata="Q3876803" url="?curid=707715" title="Nightshade (DC Comics)">
<text>Nightshade is a superhero appearing in media published by DC Comics. Created by David Kaler and Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #82 (September 1966) originally published by Charlton Comics.

==Publication history==
===Charlton Comics===
Nightshade was first introduced in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #82, as a partner for the titular hero. Her real name is Eve Eden and her father is a U.S. senator. She is blonde and wears a black wig as Nightshade. She was romantically involved with Captain Atom for a brief time.

She appeared several times in Captain Atom stories, before getting her own backup series in the last three published issues (#87-89). She also appeared in the last unpublished Captain Atom story that appeared in the fanzine &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot;. In this backup series (with art by Jim Aparo), Tiger (Judomaster&#x27;s now-grown-up sidekick) is her martial-arts instructor. The source of her powers is also finally described. Her mother, Magda, was actually a visitor from another dimension whose denizens have the ability to transform into living two-dimensional shadows; she passed these powers on to her son and daughter. On a visit to this dimension, Magda and her children are attacked. Mortally wounded, Magda is able to transport herself and Eve back to Earth. Eve promised to return and find her brother. This never occurs during the Charlton years.

In 1981, Nightshade would appear in issue #7 of the new &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot; comic. Her last &quot;Charlton&quot; appearance would be in a story that teamed up all the Charlton &quot;Action Heroes&quot; as the Sentinels of Justice, and in her own one-shot by AC Comics.

===DC Comics===
====Suicide Squad====
Once integrated into the DC Universe in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Nightshade was revamped as a government super-spy who worked for Task Force X aka the Suicide Squad. Many of her adventures alongside Captain Atom during their Charlton interactions were retconned into instead being with King Faraday. While the Suicide Squad&#x27;s core group was busy dealing with the events of the crossover &quot;Legends&quot;, Nightshade, along with fellow spy Nemesis, was sent overseas to infiltrate the mercenary death squad known as &quot;Jihad&quot;. Taking the name Chimera, Nightshade was forced to participate in the massacre of innocent civilians at an airport as Jihad sought to demonstrate their effectiveness to a potential client. This event deeply affected Nightshade, causing tension between her and Suicide Squad leader Amanda Waller. As a result of the mission with Jihad, Nightshade was removed from her position as a spy and given the job of being the handler for the mentally unstable sorceress known as the Enchantress. She also served as Waller&#x27;s liaison between Task Force X and a rival government program known as Project ATOM (which brought Nightshade into contact with the superhero Captain Atom).

As the series progressed, Nightshade revealed her past to her team: her post-&quot;Crisis&quot; origin was that she was the princess of the &quot;Land of Nightshades&quot;. Eve Eden&#x27;s mother Maureen was the queen of the Land of Nightshades, and fled to Earth with her infant children to escape the demonic power of an entity known as the Incubus. Eve believed she was a normal child until her mother took her and her brother Larry into the Land of Nightshades, to show them their true heritage. This was a costly mistake. The Incubus found them, kidnapped Larry and mortally wounded Maureen. Eve&#x27;s mother used her last breath to reveal to Eve her hereditary powers over darkness. Eve promised her dying mother that she would one day return to save her younger brother. The Incubus possessed Larry&#x27;s body, killing him in the process, and hid within the Land of Nightshades slaughtering all remaining human inhabitants. It was revealed that when Nightshade (who post-&quot;Crisis&quot; now possessed the additional ability of teleportation) used her powers to teleport that the process required her to pass through the barren and haunted Land of Nightshades.

Waller gave Nightshade permission to take the team for her personal mission in return for her help in taking down a drug cartel overseas. It was volunteer only, but everyone currently on the team agreed to go with the exception of Captain Boomerang. Bronze Tiger had to take him out, get him drunk, and drag him along unconscious. They entered the Land of Nightshades and discovered that Larry was dead and his body was controlled by the Incubus. It was revealed that June Moone&#x27;s mysterious and evil &quot;Enchantress&quot; persona was in truth the entity known as the &quot;Succubus&quot;. The two entities sought to possess Larry and Eve to force the siblings to conceive a child who would be the incarnation of their demonic master. Enchantress was stripped of her powers when the Succubus left her body to possess Nightshade. The evil entity failed to realize that Nightshade&#x27;s will was stronger than her brother&#x27;s, and was destroyed. Nightshade absorbed the Succubus&#x27; powers. With the Succubus defeated, Nightshade passively watched as her teammate Deadshot finished the mission, killing the Incubus by shooting the entity in the head.

Nightshade was a permanent fixture in the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series, appearing throughout the series run.

====After the Suicide Squad====
When the Suicide Squad series came to an end, Nightshade was shown working for Sarge Steel at the CBI. She made several appearances in the &quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; comic and would also be part of the &quot;L.A.W.&quot; miniseries, which reunited all the Charlton Action Heroes owned by DC. During the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; story arc &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, she was for a brief time under the control of Gorilla Grodd, trying to capture Superman for a billion-dollar reward. This was part of a grouping of super-powered individuals, most villains, also brainwashed by Gorilla Grodd. The reward was set out by then-President Lex Luthor. The confrontations take place in Washington, D.C. Nightshade and the villains were ultimately defeated.

====Day of Vengeance====

Nightshade has since then resurfaced as a member of the Shadowpact in the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; miniseries. She has been paired with Detective Chimp, resulting in some good-natured bickering. During the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover she joined a legion of DC&#x27;s magic-based characters battling the Seven Deadly Sins, but was captured by Felix Faust and eventually used by Alex Luthor to bring back Earth-4.

====Shadowpact====

In &quot;Shadowpact&quot; #1, Nightshade and the other Shadowpact members entered the town of Riverrock, Wyoming, which was shielded from the outside world. She met a villainous counterpart named Sister Shadow. Since then she has served with the Shadowpact battling a host of magical villains. In &quot;Shadowpact&quot; #7 it was revealed that she requires some measure of concentration to form elaborate darkness constructs, when she and her partner Ragman were attacked by the Congregation. As a result, she was unable to conjure her more elaborate darkness creatures until Blue Devil managed to get the Congregation away from her. Despite this Nightshade and her teammates found themselves blinded by the Congregation&#x27;s light power and for the first time in her life she experienced darkness. With the assistance of Madame Xanadu the Shadowpact set about restoring Nightshade&#x27;s sight, although fully restoring it took several days.

She is now capable of manifesting up to three giant humanoids at once.

====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;====
During the events of the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Nightshade has apparently rejoined the Suicide Squad. The team is sent to Belle Reve to kidnap former Suicide Squad member Deadshot. Nightshade attacks several of Deadshot&#x27;s teammates on the Secret Six, but is defeated by Black Alice after she steals Nightshade&#x27;s powers and uses them to render her unconscious. After a group of Black Lanterns composed of former Suicide Squad members arrives at Belle Reve to feast on the assembled metahumans, Amanda Waller knocks Black Alice out cold to give Nightshade back her abilities (something which Nightshade believes is too far, as Alice is just a kid). Her powers restored, Nightshade joins the combined Suicide Squad and Secret Six members in fighting off the Black Lanterns.

====Rise of Eclipso====
Some time after the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Nightshade is once again shown to be working with Shadowpact. While in another dimension, she and Nightmaster are attacked by Eclipso and his brainwashed servant, Shade. After defeating both heroes, Eclipso brings Nightshade under his mental control.

====DC Rebirth====

In &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;, a retired-from-heroics Ted Kord references Nightshade by name, calling her &quot;a comely young superheroine from back in my Beetle days&quot;.

In the &quot;Batman Vs. Deathstroke&quot; story arc of &quot;Deathstroke&quot;, Nightshade appears as an antagonist to Deathstroke, both seeking to recover a biological weapon. Nightshade sends a living shadow to attack Deathstroke and grab the box with the weapon on a memory key after he had extracted it from an ice wall. Deathstroke assumes that Amanda Waller has something to do with this, but Nightshade responds that both he and she herself aren&#x27;t with the Suicide Squad anymore but are still tangled with US intelligence operations. As she attacks with her magic, she mentions that she is an orphan and the last of her line, &quot;Homo magi&quot; and the royal house of the Land of Nightshades. She can&#x27;t transport Deathstroke to the Land of Nightshades, because the promethium in his equipment is capable of absorbing most types of energies including the Night Force. Instead, she uses her shadow-matter raven Hugin to transport Robin (Damian Wayne), who Deathstroke is working with begrudgingly, to the Land of Nightshades (where humans are driven insane as they&#x27;re faced with their worst nightmares) to force Deathstroke to open the box and give the weapon inside to her, because she can&#x27;t safely open it herself without setting off the explosives in the box. She states that the weapon is terrible and that she will destroy the weapon, even though that will go against her employer. After throwing the box to Robin, she also threatens Deathstroke that Robin might open the box and thereby set off the explosives during his insanity. Deathstroke says that they both know she won&#x27;t let Robin die, but she responds that she used to know but a lot of has changed. After Deathstroke gets Robin out of this realm, he opens the box and hands over a corrupted duplicate that Robin has switched for the real one. She then flies away with the duplicate, while Robin refuses to hand over the actual weapon to Deathstroke. Later, Adeline Kane reveals to Batman, disguised as Deathstroke, that she had hired Nightshade to secure the biological weapon.

In &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; crossover story arc, she is seen during a Sisterhood of the Sleight Hand meeting at the Oblivion Bar where she rescues Traci 13 by pulling her into the shadow dimension, as Witchfire possessed by Hecate burns and thereby kills many of the people inside the bar. After escaping through the shadow dimension, alongside Traci 13 and Enchantress, Nightshade is seen using shadows to capture Manitou Dawn who is also possessed by Hecate. In the finale of the arc, she is seen alongside a few other heroes as they confront and defeat Hecate who was then possessing Wonder Woman.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, she appears alongside Blue Beetle, the Question, and Captain Atom in the Bug airship as they travel to Mars. There, they and many of Earth&#x27;s other superheroes confront and fight Doctor Manhattan. In the battle, she fires blasts of shadows to him. All the superheroes are, however, defeated and incapacitated by Doctor Manhattan.

==Powers and abilities==
Eve Eden&#x27;s powers are hereditary as the only surviving member of her royal family. Nightshade can teleport herself and others by passing them through the Land of Nightshades, but it subjects them to their worst nightmares. She has the ability to transform herself into a semi-solid shadow form (it requires a great amount of concentration) or manipulate darkness. Eve is even capable of creating shadowly homunculi.

==Other versions==
* Earth-Two: An enemy of the Golden Age Sandman (Wesley Dodds), this Nightshade had the ability to control plants. Upon his revival in the 1980s series &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, he was renamed &quot;Ramulus&quot; to avoid confusion with the Eve Eden character and became a member of the Monster Society of Evil.
* Earth-4: In the final issue of &quot;52&quot;, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated &quot;Earth-4&quot;. As a result of Mister Mind &quot;eating&quot; aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-4, including Nightshade and the other Charlton characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-4.
* Earth-13: Shown in &quot;&quot; and known as Eve of the Shadows. Dressed in a Romani attire, she is married to the Captain Atom of her world, the &quot;Brigadier Atom&quot;. Upon avenging her namesake, and slaying The Shade, she travels the Shadowlands dimension to get back home, finding Monarch waiting for her, holding her husband by the throat. He nukes her world&#x27;s version of the United States and Canada and brings Eve back badly traumatized.
* Countdown: Arena: A female version of The Shade. This version of Nightshade, a sadistic psychopath, creates horrible creatures with her powers that torn one of the other two Nightshades, until she is taken to the Shadowlands by Eve of Shadows and has her head ripped off.
* The Flash: Two male characters were named Nightshade in &quot;The Flash&quot; television series, with a resemblance to the Sandman/Wesley Dodds. The first, Dr. Desmond Powell (played by Jason Bernard) was a hero from the 1950s, while the second was a violent antihero/villain who believed he was emulating the first (the second is also known as the Deadly Nightshade), Curtis Bohannan (played by Richard Burgi).
* : Nightshade appeared as a prominent character and later changed her name to Destiny after she received the ability to see in the future.
* Kingdom Come (Earth-22): Nightshade was briefly shown in flashbacks as a member of Magog&#x27;s Justice Battalion, along with the rest of the Charlton &#x27;Action Heroes&#x27;. She was apparently killed with the other members when Captain Atom was killed.
* Watchmen: the female superhero character (Silk Spectre) was originally supposed to be Nightshade. However, once the idea of using Charlton characters was abandoned, writer Alan Moore decided to take inspiration from other superheroes.

==In other media==
===Television===
In an unproduced proposal for a Justice League of America animated series, Nightshade was one of several characters redesigned by Bruce Timm, though she did not appear in &quot;Justice League&quot; nor &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

===Film===
* Nightshade appears in &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot;, voiced by Rachael MacFarlane.
* Nightshade appears in &quot;DC Showcase: Blue Beetle&quot;, voiced by Ashly Burch.
* Nightshade appears in &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Three&quot;, voiced again by Ashly Burch.

<text>The Volkswagen Citi Golf is a right-hand drive 5-door hatchback manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen in South Africa from 1984 to 2009 as a facelifted version of the first generation Volkswagen Golf Mk1, which ceased production in Germany in 1983.

==History==
When Volkswagen released the MK1 Golf in 1974, the car was an overnight success. It was easy and economical to drive, and inexpensive to maintain. Volkswagen South Africa started the assembly of the Golf Mk.1 in 1978. When the Golf Mk.2 was launched in 1984, VW South Africa found themselves falling short of a demand for a small, affordable entry-level car, as the Golf Mk.2 was bigger and somewhat more expensive than its predecessor. The best viable option for VW South Africa, was to continue producing some variant of the Mk.1 to fill the gap in the market, as they already had all the tooling in place at the VW assembly plant in Uitenhage, Eastern Cape. Additional tooling was imported from the VW assembly plant in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, in 1988, when production of the Mk.1 ceased there. VW South Africa decided to use only the 5-door body shell as a platform for the Citi Golf, as the tooling for the 3-door body style would take up floor space that could rather be utilised for the production of the Golf Mk.2.

The first concept for the &quot;new&quot; Golf Mk.1 was a basic, stripped-down version of the pre-1984 Mk.1, which would be called the &quot;EconoGolf&quot;. This concept was soon scrapped because it became apparent that the result too closely resembled the Mk.1s of the 1970s, an appearance that would soon go out of fashion. After extensive market research, it was decided that the Mk.1 would be &quot;rebranded&quot;, to breathe new life into the Mk.1 design. The first 3 prototypes were painted bright red, yellow and blue, with white wheels, bumpers, and decals on the doors, the latter bearing the &quot;CITI&quot; insignia on the lower rear doors. Decals were added to the tailgate as well, also bearing the &quot;CITIGOLF&quot; branding. A slightly more powerful, South African modified version of the standard 1.3-litre engine was fitted.

== Original Citi Golf ==
The original Citi Golf was only available in 3 colours (a fact highlighted in the contemporary advertising campaign which used a tagline &quot;Red, Yellow, Blue... Not Green!&quot;). The colour themes for the advertising campaigns of the first few years of production were partially inspired by the works of Dutch artist Piet Mondriaan. In mid-1985, a new, high-performance Citi Golf variation was launched as a 1.6-litre carburettor-engined Sport using the advertising tagline &quot;New Citigolf Sport, drive it home, Sport, drive it home.&quot; The 1.6-litre engine of the Citi Golf Sport was later replaced by a higher output 1.8-litre carburettor engine. Upon the launch of the Citi Golf Sport, a new colour, specially reserved for the Sport model, was also introduced. The red, yellow and blue paintwork was now also complemented by a black-with-white-decals colour scheme.

Initially, the bodywork was identical to that of the superseded Mk.1 Golf, but in September 1988, a locally designed facelift gave it a sloping grille, similar to that of the Golf Mk.2, as well as more modern &quot;deep&quot; bumpers (similar in design to the early 1980s Mk.1 bumpers, with added integrated lower aprons). The profile of the fenders was also altered to accommodate the more modern grille. A crease in the shape of an ice-hockey stick was also added to the C-pillar behind the rear doors. This crease not only served as a decoration, but it assisted in the elimination of smaller creases in the large area of the C-pillar during pressing. It was also at this time that the Citi Golf Sport was also fitted with the bigger 1781cc 70 kW engine, and a five-speed semi-close ratio gearbox from the Golf Mk.2 GTS.

== Citi CTi ==
In 1990, Volkswagen South Africa reintroduced the Golf Mk.1 GTi as the Citi CTi. Using basically the same 1.8-litre 82 kW Bosch K-Jetronic fuel-injected engine as the original Golf Mk.1 GTi, the Citi CTi was then the fastest Citi Golf ever made, with a top speed of just over 180 km/h. This was a welcome addition to the Citi Golf range, as it was aimed at younger drivers who were looking for a more zippy car at a more affordable price. The Golf Mk.2 GTi was too far up-market for the younger VW performance vehicle fanatics.

From around 2001–2002, all Citi Golf models were fitted with quad headlamps, rear window wiper-washer and fender-mounted sideways-facing indicator lights as standard equipment.

== Facelift ==
In 2004, the Citi Golf received a facelift that included a new dashboard lifted from the Škoda Fabia, as well as larger front side windows. The rear wiper-washer combination was also moved into the glass of the (now standard) heated rear window to give the car a sleeker appearance. Along with this modification, the rear window was curved in such a way that it resembled a sort of &quot;bubble&quot;-like appearance, presumably to eliminate the annoying reflection of sunlight from the flat, steeply sloped window into the eyes of other drivers following behind.

The 2006 facelift saw modifications to the front bumper (adding a second grille in the integrated apron) as well as new, unique-to-South-Africa taillights incorporating a circular inset taillight–brake light combination. Before this facelift, all Citi Golfs were fitted with the early 1980s style rear tail light cluster very much like those on European Mark 1s, but the new units were locally manufactured by Hella.

Throughout the Citi Golf&#x27;s 25-year lifespan, hundreds of small and large mechanical modifications were also made to the model, to comply with more strict local emission and safety standards. For instance, by 2008 all carburetted engines were replaced by more efficient fuel-injected units.

== Citi Golf, Caddy and Fox ==
A sedan version called the Fox (Volkswagen Jetta A1) was also produced, along with a coupé utility called the Caddy. Both of these models were discontinued before the Citi Golf hatchback production halted.

The Citi Golf, Caddy and Fox models are no longer in production in South Africa. After production of the Citi Golf ceased in 2009, the body shape of the mid-2000s Polo was also retained but stripped down and re-marketed as the Polo Vivo, to replace the entry-level segment that the Citi Golf had filled for 25 years. A new shape Vivo based on the 5th generation Polo is currently in production alongside the new Polo, as of July 2019. The sedan versions of these vehicles are being built in India and Brazil respectively.

==Special Editions==
Many &quot;Special Edition&quot; Citi Golfs carrying unique trim and equipment combinations have been released throughout the car&#x27;s production run and include the &quot;Designa&quot; and the &quot;Citi.com&quot;, the latter of which, in theory, was available only if ordered over the Internet. Another special edition called the &quot;Deco&quot; introduced colour-coded leather seats to the car in 1995. It was available in three derivatives, namely red, green and a special electric blue. The latter was initially only offered on the Citi but was later transferred to other Volkswagen models as well. The &quot;VeloCiti&quot; model was one of the best sellers. Other limited editions included the Citi Billabong and Citi Xcite. The most recent special edition is the &quot;GTS&quot;, which takes its cues from the original GTS. Only 375 Citi GTS&#x27;s were ever built. The “Chico” was another variant, available in the late 1990s.

The second last additions to the Citi Golf lineup is the Citi 1.8iR and Citi 1.8i(red &quot;i&quot; badge), which was unveiled at the Auto Africa Expo in October 2006 in Johannesburg. It features enhanced styling and specification, including a full body kit, partial leather front seats, and aluminium trim on the dashboard. The Citi 1.8i had the same spec as the iR apart from the exclusion of the body kit. The engine is a 1.8-litre fuel-injected unit which, although it shares its displacement with the iconic CTi, pushes out 8 kW of extra power, taking it up to 90 kW. This was accomplished via replacing the stock camshaft with an Estas 272 degree unit, a Brospeed(Bosal) sports exhaust and Brospeed 4-2-1 exhaust manifold as well as retuning the Bosch MP9 fuel injection to accommodate said changes. A lower strut brace was fitted to the front suspension. VWSA claims that it can accomplish 0 to 100 km/h in 8.5 seconds. This was also a limited edition and only 375 units were made between 2006 and 2008.

==End of production and replacement==

The Citi Golf came to the end of production in South Africa after 25 years on 21 August 2009. A special version of the Citi Golf, called the Citi Mk1, was released as a celebratory model. These are numbered 1 to 1000 and have several special features including lowered suspension, 15” alloy wheels, tinted windows, a leather sports steering wheel with airbag, and chrome foil side stripes. The colours available for the Citi Mk1 were shadow blue metallic and black magic pearl.

On 11 March 2010, it was announced that it would be replaced by a version of the Volkswagen Polo Mk4, called the Polo Vivo, the newer Polo being similar in size to the original Golf.

<text>The National Union of Students (NUS) is the peak representative body for Australian higher education students. A student union is eligible for membership by its classification as a legitimate student representative body at any Australian post-secondary training provider. The NUS typically organises NUS National Conference (NatCon), NUS Education Conference (EdCon), and the Presidents&#x27; Summit each year in addition to other smaller conferences.

==History==

=== Formation ===
NUS in its current form came into being in 1987 after the collapse of its predecessor, the Australian Union of Students (AUS), in 1984. The AUS was first known from 1937 to 1971 as the National Union of Australian University Students (NUAUS), before allowing membership of colleges of higher education in 1971, which necessitated a name change.

=== Membership fees ===
In 2003, NUS membership fees became indexed to consumer price index (CPI) removing some of the strain on the union&#x27;s finances. In 2004, the NUS charged $5 per equivalent full time study loads (EFTSL) of students represented by each member organisation. This raised small fears that many small and regional campus organisations might disaffiliate due to increases in affiliation fees.

In 2023, affiliation fees were set at $2.00 per EFTSL and in 2024 the National Executive of the NUS set affiliation fees at $2.11 per EFTSL.

=== Voluntary student unionism ===
The introduction of voluntary student unionism (VSU) by the Howard government led to student union membership plummeting by up to 95%. Following associated reductions in funding for services provided by many student unions, the NUS called for alternative options to be explored to restore funding and ensure students would remain able to access student union services. In a written submission responding to a discussion paper on the impact of VSU, the NUS raised concerns that reliance on direct funding from the federal government or universities would impact the ability of student representatives to effectively advocate for students.

In 2024, the NUS&#x27;s official policy, set by National Conference in December 2023, was to campaign for a 50% minimum share of Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) for student unions. In May of 2024, it was announced that government would be mandating that student unions receive 40% of SSAF, coming close to meeting the NUS&#x27;s demands.

=== Accreditation of universities ===
In 2016, Australian National University Students&#x27; Association voted against accrediting with NUS, citing problems with the conduct of factional delegates at the National Conference. The Adelaide University Union (AUU) voted to cease their SRC from authorising payments of Accreditation to NUS in their March Meeting. The AUU&#x27;s SRC later condemned the move and restated its affiliation, and intention to pay accreditation fees autonomously. The Wollongong Undergraduate Students&#x27; Association also held a referendum during 2016 to end their affiliation with the NUS; the affiliation was later restored.

In 2017, the Australian National University Students&#x27; Association voted to accredit with NUS once again. Also in 2017, the Tasmanian University Union voted to end its affiliation with the NUS. The Tasmanian University Student Association re-accredited in 2023. The University of Queensland Union also re-accredited to the NUS in 2023.

==Governance==

NUS&#x27; national structure is formalised into both a National Executive and State Branches. The National Executive is the primary decision-making body of the NUS, voted in by delegates from each member student union at the National Conference. 

=== National Executive ===
The responsibilities of the National executive, as described within the NUS constitution, include; setting the budget for the NUS; regularly monitoring of the finances of NUS; employing staff on behalf of NUS; authorising the publication of material on behalf of NUS; and implementing and interpreting the policy of the NUS. The National Executive may also delegate its powers as it considers appropriate.
The members of National Executive are:
* The National President (chair, casting vote only),
* The National officers (voting),
* 12 General Executive Members (voting), and
* The State Presidents (voting).

National Officers of the NUS do not carry a vote at the National Conference of NUS and members of National Executive may not hold more than 1 voting position on National Executive at the same time.

==== National Officers ====
The National Officers of NUS are elected annually at the National Conference, with their terms commencing in January.

A motion to abolish the National Environment Officer position was passed at the 2016 National Conference. This change came into effect at the 2017 National Conference. 

A motion to create the National Vocational Education Officer position was passed at the 2021 National Conference. This change came into effect at the 2022 National Conference.

The paid national officers of the NUS are:

* National President,
* National General Secretary/National Deputy President,
* National Education Officer,
* National Welfare Officer,
* National Women&#x27;s Officer (who must be a woman),
* Two National Queer/LGBTQIA+ Officers (one of whom must be woman-identifying),
Paid national officers are paid an hourly wage equal to the Australian Federal minimum wage with the National President and National General Secretary paid 1 full-time equivalent (FTE) wage and other paid officers are paid a minimum of 0.5 FTE. In 2024, the honorarium of the National Education Officer, National Welfare Officer, and National Women&#x27;s Officer was set at 0.75 FTE by the National Executive of the NUS. In the same meeting, the honorarium for the National Queer Office was set at 1.0 FTE to be split between the two officers.

The unpaid national officers of the NUS are:
* National Small and Regional Campuses Officer (who must be a student currently enrolled at a small and/or regional NUS member campus),
* National First Nations Officer (who must identify as a student from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background),
* National Ethnocultural Officer (who must identify as a student from a culturally or linguistically diverse background),
* National International Students Officer (who must be currently enrolled as an international student),
* National Disability Officer (who must identify as a student with a disability),
* National Vocational Education Officer.

===State Branches===

The state branches of the NUS include; New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, and Western Australia.

The members of State Executive are:
* The State President (chair),
* The State Education Vice President, and 
* The President (or equivalent officer) from each accredited campus.

==== State Officers ====
The State Branch Officers of NUS are elected annually at the National Conference, with their terms commencing in January. State and Territories officers are only elected if there are accredited campus from that State/Territory. The State Branch positions other than President and Education Vice President were abolished after the 2015 National Conference, coming into effect at the conclusion of the 2016 term of office.

=== Departments ===
There are 10 departments of the NUS, each overseen by the relevant National Officer with a limited degree of autonomy. These departments coordinate discussions with the relevant local officers at each university&#x27;s student union, host specific conferences for their issues, and used to include the state branch officers (until those roles were removed in 2016). 

These departments are:

* Education Office
* Welfare Office
* Women&#x27;s Office
* Queer Office
* Disabilities Office
* First Nations Office
* Ethnocultural Office
* International Students Office
* Small &amp; Regional Campuses Office
* Vocational Education/TAFE Office

=== National Conference ===
National Conference (also referred to as NatCon), is the NUS&#x27;s annual general meeting (AGM). The NUS must hold National Conference within 5 months of the end of its financial year, with the conference beginning on the second Monday in December. The conference sees delegates from all accredited campuses gather to vote on policy that decides the direction of the union for the next year. The election of national and state officers, as well as campus representatives, occurs during the week of National Conference. Member organisations and associate organisations are able to appoint observers to National Conference.

NatCon has at times been criticised for the perceived lack of transparency, owing in part to the fact that filming is typically banned for the entirety of the conference. Proponents of the ban on filming have argued that this ban is to protect the privacy of attendees and enable them to engage more freely in debate, not to prevent transparency.

==Factions==
Historically, the NUS has been dominated by members of Young Labor, with every President being a member since the creation of the NUS in 1987.

Many NUS delegates are members of a faction, which are groups of students operating with a shared political platform. Some delegates alternatively choose to be independent from any factions and these students are typically referred to as small-i independents. Typically, each faction has a pre-conference caucus where they decide their positions on policy.

The main factions are

* Student Unity (Unity): typically associated with Labor Right and typically the faction with the highest number of delegates. This faction is known to bind votes. As a result of a long-standing sweetheart deal with NLS, the National General Secretary has been a member of Unity every year except one.
* National Labor Students (NLS) typically associated with Labor Left and typically the faction with the second highest number of delegates. This faction is known to bind votes. As a result of the aforementioned sweetheart deal with Unity, the National President has been a member of NLS every year since the formation of the NUS.
* Socialist Alternative (SAlt, SA, Trots): are a Marxist faction coming close to NLS&#x27;s share of delegates. This faction is known to bind votes.
* Australian Liberal Students&#x27; Federation (Liberals, Libs): typically associated with the Liberal party. Generally, Liberal-controlled universities disaffiliate from the NUS, leading to them generally having little power. In 2017, they gave their votes to Unity.
* Grassroots Independents (Grindies): typically associated with the Greens. This party is not known to bind votes.
* Forge: Following the a 2024 National Labor Students split, the Western Australia caucus of NLS left the faction, shortly followed by the Queensland caucus of NLS. Members of the Queensland NLS caucus shortly reformed as a faction known as Forge.

==Financial and structural crisis==

In a report commissioned by the NUS secretariat in 2013, independent auditors TLConsult authored a report which cited NUS&#x27; &quot;inflexible factional system&quot; as detrimental to the organisation and leading to &quot;historical accounting approach ... out of step with modern financial practices&quot;. Auditors &quot;question-ed whether some stakeholders generally understood their responsibilities to NUS&quot;, citing alliances by some national officers to factions, rather than NUS, as contributing the structural issues faced by the organisation.

The TLConsult audit said that NUS only had enough cash reserves to &quot;sustain the organisation for approximately one year in its current form&quot; and that although voluntary student unionism had resulted in a notable decline in revenue, it was structural problems, &quot;unchanged for nearly two decades&quot;, that were the primary cause of the NUS&#x27; current financial problems.

In response to the financial pressures outlined in the audit which cited significant deficits run by NUS over the previous few years, and following outgoing NUS President Deanna Taylor&#x27;s admission that they &quot;the advice given to NUS is that were our income and expenditure levels to remain status quo, NUS would not exist beyond the next few years&quot;, delegates to the 2014 conference voted in favor of a financial and structural review, and to eliminate the stipend for the positions of National Indigenous, International Students and Disability Officer. However, an attempt to eliminate state officer bearer positions (presidents excepted) was not passed by conference delegates.

== Union affiliation ==
Typically, university student unions&#x27; Representative Councils will vote on NUS accreditation. As of 2022, accredited university unions include;

<doc id="707741" wikidata="Q258920" url="?curid=707741" title="Transport Layer Interface">
<text>In computer networking, the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) was the networking API provided by AT&amp;T UNIX System V Release 3 (SVR3) in 1987 and continued into Release 4 (SVR4). TLI was the System V counterpart to the BSD sockets programming interface, which was also provided in UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4). TLI was later standardized as XTI, the [[X/Open Transport Interface]].

==TLI and Sockets==
It was originally expected that the OSI protocols would supersede TCP/IP, thus TLI is designed from an OSI model-oriented viewpoint, corresponding to the OSI transport layer. Otherwise, TLI looks similar, API-wise, to sockets.

TLI and XTI were widely used (?) and, up to UNIX 98, may have been preferred over the POSIX Sockets API with respect to existing standards. However, it was clear at least since the early 1990s that the Berkeley Socket interface would ultimately prevail. TLI and XTI are still supported in SVR4-derived operating systems and operating systems conforming to branded UNIX (UNIX 95, UNIX 98 and UNIX 03 Single UNIX Specifications) such as Solaris and AIX (as well as the classic Mac OS, in the form of Open Transport). Under UNIX 95 (XPG4) and UNIX 98 (XPG5.2), XTI was the preferred and recommended supported API for new transport protocols. As a result of deliberations by the Austin Group with the goal of bringing flavors of UNIX that do not provide STREAMS, such as BSD and Linux, under the Single UNIX Specification, the UNIX 03 Single UNIX Specification both declares STREAMS as optional, and declares POSIX Sockets as the preferred API for new transport protocols.

<text>The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-7R was a 750cc motorcycle in the Ninja sport bike series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki produced from 1989 until 2003

From 1989 through 1995, this motorcycle was marketed as the ZX-7 in the United States. In the European and Asian markets, this motorcycle was sold under the ZXR-750 name.

Beginning in 1991, Kawasaki offered a superbike homologation version of the ZX-7, dubbed the ZX-7R in the US and the ZXR-750R worldwide.

In 1996 Kawasaki dropped the ZXR name worldwide and the former ZX-7 / ZXR-750 became the ZX-7R and the homologation ZX-7R / ZXR-750R became the ZX-7RR.

==Overview==
The ZX-7R is powered by a liquid cooled, 749cc in-line four-cylinder with double overhead camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. The engine case, cylinders and cylinder head are made from aluminum. A multi-plate wet clutch transfers power to a 6 speed transmission.

The frame used on the ZX-7R is an aluminum twin-spar design, constructed of several pressed and cast aluminum sections welded together. The rear subframe is made of welded square tube steel sections, providing enough strength for a pillion passenger.

The double sided aluminum swingarm used largely the same fabrication techniques as the frame. The rear suspension used Kawasaki&#x27;s Uni-Trak rocker arm system, designed to provide a progressively stiffer damping and spring rate under compression.

== Production Years ==

===ZX-7 (H1) 1989===

The first year ZX-7 was launched in 1989 and received mixed reviews from motorcycle journalists. Some criticized its weight; 30 lbs heavier than that years Suzuki GSXR750 and 70 lbs heavier than Honda&#x27;s RC30. Overall it was praised for its approachable handling, albeit with a noticeably stiff rear suspension.

The H1 model produces 107 crankshaft horsepower at 10,500 rpm. The engine has a 68mm bore, a 51.5mm stroke and a compression ratio of 10.8:1. The valves are actuated directly by the camshaft via bucket style tappets. Fueling is accomplished via 4x 36mm Kehin CVKD constant velocity carburetors. Intake air is fed to the air-box through the two tubes run from the front cowling through the fuel tank. The oil is cooled via a separate, oil to air heat exchanger mounted below the radiator.

The frame is an aluminum perimeter type. The suspension consists of adjustable 43mm forks at the front and a monoshock at the rear connected to the swingarm with a Unitrak rocker linkage. Front brakes are dual 310mm rotors with 4 piston calipers. The rear brake is a 230mm rotor and two piston caliper. Wheelbase measured 1410mm. Dry weight was measured at 451.9 lbs.

===ZX-7 (H2) 1990===
The 1990 model year inherited many of the items in the &quot;race kit&quot; from the prior year. The swingarm, previously a box beam type was updated to be a single cast/welded piece. Engine changes included larger 38mm carburetors, shorter pistons, longer connecting rods, and an increased compression ratio of 11.3:1. The oil filter, previously an external spin on design was moved to an internal paper cartridge style. The exhaust header, radiator and oil cooler were changed as well. Wheelbase was lengthened to 1455mm. Dry weight was measured at 441 lbs (200 kg).

===ZX-7 (J1,J2) 1991-92===

For 1991, the ZX-7 received a host of changes. A new shorter stroke engine was introduced with a bore of 71mm and a stroke of 47.3mm. This new engine retained the 11.3:1 compression ratio and 38mm Kehin carburetors from the H2 model. The valves are actuated via rocker-arm style cam followers instead of the direct actuation on previous models. The oil cooler was changed to be an oil-to-coolant style heat exchanger. The engine is now utilized as a stressed member of the chassis. These models were deliberately restricted by Kawasaki to 100 hp due to fear of a potential Europe-wide horsepower limit.

The aluminum perimeter chassis was lightened and equipped with new inverted 43mm forks, and larger 320mm front brakes. The wheelbase was shortened again to 1420mm. This new model weighed roughly 30 lbs less than the prior year. The J2 model received a reduced spring rate in the rear in an effort to make the rear suspension less stiff.

===ZX-7R (K1, K2) 1991-92===

The 1991 ZX-7R is the first year of the super bike homologation version of the ZX-7. Many changes were made in order to improve performance and usability on the track. The engine is unrestricted and equipped with 39mm Kehin flat slide carburetors, more aggressive camshafts, a higher 11.5:1 compression ratio and a close ratio transmission. This engine produces 121 horsepower at the crankshaft. The steel tank of the ZX-7 was replaced with an aluminum version to save weight. The front and rear suspension is fully adjustable. The ZX-7R can be quickly identified by its single rear seat and lack of passenger footpads.

===ZX-7 (L1, L2, L3) 1993-95===

The 1993 ZX-7 is the first model to have Ram-Air, an engine air intake positioned next to the headlights on the front fairing. The ram air intake is ducted from the front of the motorcycle, through the frame and into the bottom side of the engine air-box. This system is designed to take advantage of the motorcycle&#x27;s velocity, allowing for the stagnation pressure of air at the front to provide a positive pressure to the engine intake. Another advantage is the cooler air temperature seen at the front of the motorcycles as compared to next to the engine.

The 1993 ZX-7 inherited the ZX-7R motor from the previous year, minus the flat slide carburetors and close ratio transmission. The engine has a bore of 71mm, stroke of 41.7mm, compression ratio of 11.5:1 and breathes through 4x Kehin 38mm CVKD carburetors. The engine produces 118 hp at the crank and 54.3 lb-ft of torque.

Chassis improvements include smaller diameter, 41mm inverted front forks, and a revised, more linear Uni-track linkage at the rear. These updates addressed many of the handling problems with the previous models, specifically regarding rear suspension stiffness. The wheelbase was lengthened to 1430mm. Dry weight was measured at 452 lbs (205 kg).

=== ZX-7R (M1, M2) 1993-94 ===
The 1993 ZX-7R received the same major updates as the ZX-7, benefiting from the addition of Ram-air. The ZX-7R engine is equipped with 39mm Kehin FVKD flat slide carburetors and a close ratio 6-speed transmission, producing 121 horsepower at the crankshaft.

One update not received by the ZX-7R was the revised rear shock and linkage, instead the older, stiffer setup was carried over. The front forks have additional adjustability, with 13 way rebound and 8 way compression adjustment. This ZX-7R introduced an adjustable swingarm pivot allowing for further adjustment of the bikes handling characteristics. Like the previous ZX-7R, this model received an aluminum fuel tank for weight savings. The subframe is also smaller to save weight without the need to support a passenger. Dry weight was measured at 431 lbs (200 kg).

=== ZX-7R (P1-P7) 1996-2003 ===

In 1996, Kawasaki changed the U.S. naming convention for its 750cc sport bikes. The ZX-7 was now to be known as the ZX-7R and the ZX-7R became the ZX-7RR.

This model year was a large update to the 750cc Kawasaki, receiving an entirely new engine and dual Ram-air inlets. The engine has a bore of 73mm and a stroke of 44.7mm. The rocker-arm style cam followers of previous years was replaced with a direct actuation bucket style, reducing valve-train inertia and allowing for higher engine RPM. The throttle pulley was moved from the far right side of the engine to the middle, reducing free play in the throttle butterflies in an effort to stabilize idle RPM. The cylinder head received a wider, 25 degree valve angle compared to the previous years 20 degrees. The larger cylinder bore necessitated the move to a closed deck cylinder, and the cylinder head received oiling and cooling improvements. The exhaust header was updated to be a 4-2-1 style instead of the previous year&#x27;s 4–1. This engine produced 123 crankshaft horsepower.

The chassis was updated with a stiffer frame and larger 43mm forks with added adjustment for rebound. The rear shock also gained additional adjustability with 20 way compression adjustment and 4 way rebound adjustment. Braking was improved with new 6-piston Tokiko front calipers. Total dry weight was 448 lbs (203 kg).

=== ZX-7RR (N1) 1996 ===
The 1996 ZX-7RR received track focused improvements such as; larger Kehin FVKD 41mm flat slide carburetors, and a stronger paper based clutch lining. Additional changes were; a quick-change camshaft sprocket, close ratio transmission and a heavier flywheel to prevent rear wheel spin while cornering.

The chassis was stiffened with gusseting near the rear of the engine. The suspension received additional adjustability; 28 way compression and 13 way rebound on the front forks, 20 way compression and 18 way rebound on the rear shock. The 6-piston Tokiko calipers on the standard model were swapped out for 6-piston Nissin units. A smaller 8AH battery is fitted for weight savings.

1996 was the only year the ZX-7RR was sold.

== Racing ==

The ZX-7 was raced by both factory Kawasaki and privateer teams during its production run. Racing variants of the ZX-7R and ZX-7RR attained notable achievements in a variety of motorcycle racing events:

* Kawasaki returned to the FIM Endurance World Championship in 1988 fielding the then new ZXR-7. Kawasaki went on to win the championship in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996.
* In 1990, Doug Chandler won the AMA Superbike Championship riding on a Team Muzzy race prepped ZX-7.
* In 1990, 1991 and 1992, Scott Russell won the AMA 750 Supersport championship riding on a Team Muzzy race prepped ZX-7. Russel went undefeated in 1991 riding the ZX-7, winning all 9 rounds of the series.
* In 1992, Scott Russell won the AMA Superbike Championship riding on a Team Muzzy race prepped ZX-7R.
* In 1993, again riding on a Team Muzzy race prepped ZXR-750R, Scott Russel won the Superbike World Championship, giving Kawasaki their first WSBK championship.
* Riding a race prepped version of the then new 1996 ZX-7RR, Team Muzzy and Doug Chandler came back to win the AMA Superbike Championship again in 1996 and 1997.
* The ZX-7 won the Canadian Superbike Championship every year from 1991 to 1999.
* In 1992, John Reynolds won the British Superbike Championship riding a Team Green ZXR-750R.

<doc id="707748" wikidata="Q6869253" url="?curid=707748" title="Official minority languages of Sweden">
<text>In 1999, the Minority Language Committee of Sweden formally declared five official minority languages: Finnish, Sámi languages, Romani, Yiddish, and Meänkieli (Tornedal Finnish).

The Swedish language dominates commercial and cultural life in Sweden but did not officially become the country&#x27;s main language until 2009, when a new language law entered into effect. The need for this legal status had been the subject of protracted debate and proposed legislation was narrowly defeated in 2005.

The minority languages have been legally recognized to protect the cultural and historical heritage of their respective speech communities. These communities are given certain rights on that basis, such as school education in their language, and its use in dealing with governmental agencies.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
These are the criteria established by the Minority Language Committee, influenced by the directives from the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1997.

To be accorded official minority status, a language must have been spoken in Sweden for a significant amount of time. A precise figure has not been revealed, but qualified estimations consider 100 years to be reasonable, based on the included and excluded languages. A significant immigration to Sweden did not start until after World War I, and many languages currently spoken by a large number of people in Sweden are excluded, among them Arabic and Persian.

It is also required that the language be spoken by a significant number of people and be centred in a specific geographical region. (This criterion was waived for Romani and Yiddish.)

Furthermore, it is a condition that the granting of official minority language status should be of cultural benefit to the group speaking it. It is allegedly for this reason that Swedish Sign Language was not included – even though it is a unique language with a history dating back to the 18th century, it was considered to have a sufficiently stable basis already in Swedish culture.

Common culture is yet another criterion for inclusion.

== Affected languages ==

=== Finnish ===
Finnish has been spoken in Sweden ever since the (then provincial) borders were drawn in the 13th century. Sweden has always had a significant migration to and from Finland. As the two languages belong to different language families it is easy to distinguish them, unlike the neighbouring languages Norwegian and Danish. The number of Finnish speakers in Sweden today has been estimated to over 460,000. Even though many current Swedes are of full or mixed Finnish descent, Swedish is the main language in practice for many bilinguals.

Finnish and Meänkieli can be used in the northernmost municipalities of Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and Övertorneå and its immediate neighbourhood.

On 11 December 2007, Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE reported, that in Uppsala, Sweden, speaking Finnish was forbidden from municipal employees, and that this was the case also with small talk during breaks. According to an agreement between the city council and the municipal trade union the official working language is Swedish and two employees were not allowed to speak Finnish with one another in the common work premises or in break rooms. The Equality Ombudsman considered that a ban was permissible in that particular case.

=== Meänkieli ===
Meänkieli (also known as Tornionlaaksonsuomi [lit. Tornedalian Finnish] and Tornedalian) is spoken by a population in northern Sweden. Meänkieli is primarily considered a separate language in Sweden due to historical, sociological and political reasons arising from the creation of the 1809 border between Sweden and Finland. However on purely linguistic grounds, it may be viewed as a dialect of Finnish as it is highly mutually integible with the Northern Finnish dialects, although it contains much stronger influences from Swedish and has conserved some archaic features which the Northern dialects in Finland have lost. According to the National Association of Swedish Tornedalians, 70,000 individuals are able to understand Meänkieli, at least to some level. 

=== Sámi languages ===
In Sweden, Sámi languages encompasses five closely related Uralic languages — Lule, Northern, Pite, Southern, and Ume Sámi — although they are commonly referred to as a single language, , in the country. Of those who speak a Sámi language in Sweden, the majority (61%) speak Northern Sámi, followed by Southern Sámi (22%), and Lule Sámi (17%); Pite and Ume Sámi are critically endangered languages with few speakers. As a minority language, Sámi is an official language and may be used in government agencies, courts, preschools and nursing homes in the municipalities where it is most common.

=== Romani ===
Romani chib, the language of Romani people, has been spoken in Sweden since the 16th century. Today about 9,500 people speak it in Sweden. It does not have a geographical center, but is considered to be of historical importance.

=== Yiddish ===
Yiddish has been a common language of Ashkenazi (Central and Eastern European) Jews since early in their history. The first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century.
As of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000–6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750–1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.

The organization &quot;Sveriges Jiddischförbund&quot; (Yiddish Association of Sweden) has been the national parent organization for Yiddish speakers and has four local chapters in Borås, Gothenburg, Stockholm and Malmö. It has been active since 1976 and was previously known as &quot;Sällskapet för jiddisch och jiddischkultur i Sverige&quot; (The Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) which is now the name of the chapter based in Stockholm.

Romani and Yiddish have minority language status throughout the country and are covered by government obligations regarding their preservation.

<text>A minority language is a language spoken by a minority of the population of a territory. Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 196 sovereign states recognized internationally (as of 2019) and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also official languages, such as Irish in Ireland or the numerous indigenous languages of Bolivia. Likewise, some national languages are often considered minority languages, insofar as they are the national language of a stateless nation.

== Definitions ==
There is no scholarly consensus on what a &quot;minority language&quot; is, because various different standards have been applied in order to classify languages as &quot;minority language&quot; or not. According to Owens (2013), attempts to define minority languages generally fall into several categories:
* Demographic definitions: &#x27;Minority languages are those whose speakers are fewer than those of another group(s), within a defined area.&#x27; In highly linguistically diverse areas, this can mean that even the largest language community is smaller than 50% of the total population of that area (a &quot;plurality language&quot; rather than a &quot;majority language&quot;). As an example, de Vries (1990) pointed out that at the time, the country of Cameroon&#x27;s largest linguistic group, Fang, constituted only 19% of the total Cameroonian population, and was thus a minority in the country.
* Socio-political definitions: &#x27;Minority languages are those which a given population perceives to be minority ones&#x27;, or even &#x27;those languages whose speakers, the linguistic minority, feel their language as threatened.&#x27; Such definitions have several issues in that they tend to be subjective, used for political campaigning to urge political and legal institutions to officially recognise them, and to suffer from Eurocentrism.
* Ethno-social definitions: Allardt (1984) proposed a definition of &quot;minority language&quot; based on four criteria: &quot;self-categorization, common descent, distinctive linguistic, cultural or historic traits related to language, social organization of the interaction of language groups in such a fashion that the group becomes placed in a minority position.&quot; Owens (2013) pointed out that these criteria are &#x27;useful&#x27;, but in practice, many suggested &quot;minority languages&quot; cannot fulfill all four criteria simultaneously; for example, some members of proposed linguistic minorities do not self-categorise with it, or do not claim common descent with all other members. Finally, the social organisation of a linguistic minority into a (political) minority position is problematic for various reasons, such as situations in which the politically dominant linguistic group in society is outnumbered by a politically marginalised group. As an example, Owens stated that French-speaking colonists (&quot;Pied-Noirs&quot;) in French Algeria were a demographic minority, but marginalised the Arabic-speaking majority population (along with Berber-speaking groups such as the Kabyles), leaving open the question which language should be considered a &quot;minority language&quot; or not in this situation.

==Law and international politics==

===Europe===
;Definitions
In most European countries, the minority languages are defined by legislation or constitutional documents and afforded some form of official support. In 1992, the Council of Europe adopted the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe. For the purposes of the Charter, it stipulated the following definitions:

;Attitudes towards the Charter
The signatories that have not yet ratified it as of 2012 are Azerbaijan, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, North Macedonia, Malta, and Moldova. Refraining from signing or ratifying the Charter is also caused by the refusal (for instance, in Estonia or Malta) to recognize such postimperial world languages as English, French or Russian as minority languages, even if they are spoken by minority populations. The symbolic, cultural and political power vested in such world languages empowers any demographically minority population to such a degree that any additional rights (for example, the status of a minority language) granted to their given world language may precipitate the rapid decline of the state (national) language in favor of the world language. That is the situation in Belarus, where after 1995 Russian empowered as an &#x27;equal co-official language&#x27; marginalized the use of Belarusian. The Charter was employed to achieve the same effect in Ukraine after 2010 by marginalizing Ukrainian through empowered Russian, a scenario which was only prevented by the Revolution of Dignity in 2014.

===Canada===
In Canada the term &quot;minority language&quot; is used in the Constitution of Canada, in the heading above section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which guarantees educational rights to official language minority communities. In Canada, the term &quot;minority language&quot; is generally understood to mean whichever of the official languages is less spoken in a particular province or territory (i.e., English in Québec, French elsewhere).

==Politics==

Minority languages may be marginalised within nations for a number of reasons. These include having a relatively small number of speakers, a decline in the number of speakers, and popular belief that these speakers are uncultured, or primitive, or the minority language is a dialect of the dominant language. Support for minority languages is sometimes viewed as supporting separatism, for example, the ongoing revival of the Celtic languages in the British Isles and France (Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Cornish and Breton). The dominant culture may consider use of immigrant minority languages to be a threat to unity, indicating that such communities are not integrating into the larger culture. Both of these perceived threats are based on the notion of the exclusion of the majority language speakers. Often this is added to by political systems by not providing support (such as education and policing) in these languages.

Speakers of majority languages can and do learn minority languages, through the large number of courses available. It is not known whether most students of minority languages are members of the minority community re-connecting with the community&#x27;s language, or others seeking to become familiar with it.

===Controversy===

Views differ as to whether the protection of official languages by a state representing the majority speakers violates the human rights of minority speakers. In March 2013, Rita Izsák, UN Independent Expert on minority issues, said that &quot;protection of linguistic minority rights is a human rights obligation and an essential component of good governance, efforts to prevent tensions and conflict, and the construction of equal and politically and socially stable societies&quot;.

In Slovakia for example, the Hungarian community generally considers the &#x27;language law&#x27; enacted in 1995 to be discriminatory and inconsistent with the European Charter for the Protection of Regional or Minority languages. The Majority Slovaks believed that minority speakers&#x27; rights are guaranteed, in accordance with the highest European standards, and are not discriminated against by the state language having preferential status. The language law declares that &quot;the Slovak language enjoys a preferential status over other languages spoken on the territory of the Slovak Republic.&quot; As a result of a 2009 amendment, a fine of up to €5,000 may be imposed for a misdemeanor from the regulations protecting the preferential status of the state language, e.g. if the name of a shop or a business is indicated on a sign-board first in the minority language and only after it in Slovak, or if in a bilingual text, the minority language part is written with bigger fonts than its Slovak equivalent, or if the bilingual text on a monument is translated from the minority language to the dominant language and not vice versa, or if a civil servant or doctor communicates with a minority speaker citizen in a minority language in a local community where the proportion of the minority speakers is less than 20%.

Sign languages are often not recognized as true natural languages, although extensive research supports the case that they are independent languages.

Speakers of auxiliary languages have also struggled for their recognition. They are used primarily as second languages and have few native speakers.

=== Numerical thresholds ===
* Belgium: From Belgium&#x27;s founding in 1830, the government had promoted French as the sole national language. The marginalised Dutch-language community, generally known as Flemish people, gradually managed to emancipate itself through the Flemish Movement, and in 1898 the Equality Law () first recognised Dutch as equal to French in judicial matters (legal documents). The 1919 annexation of the mostly German-speaking Eupen-Malmedy area in to Belgium also led to a movement for the recognition of German as a local minority language. By 1930, a rough agreement had emerged that Belgian citizens should be able to communicate with the authorities in their native language in the municipalities where it constituted the majority of speakers. According to the &quot;Law of 28 June 1932 on the use of languages in administrative matters&quot; ( ), the municipalities of Belgium were considered &quot;bilingual&quot; if speakers of a minority language constituted at least 30% of the municipal population, which meant that the linguistic minority was entitled to certain rights. To determine these percentages, reference was made to the linguistic census ( ). The first census, held in 1846, was widely regarded as scholarly reliable regarding the numbers of speakers; however, from the second linguistic census of 1886 onwards, the methodology of the census changed, pressure on citizens to report speaking or knowing the French language increased, more and more cases of fraud were found, and the reliability of the results was increasingly questioned by scholars and Flemish activists. For example, a 1933 investigation concluded that in 22 of the 23 language border municipalities in which the 1930 census was conducted, the results were incorrect, and in each case, the incorrect results favoured the French language; moreover, some &#x27;language inspectors&#x27; tasked with checking the accuracy results had received death threats. The legal effect of the censuses was that certain previously monolingually-Dutch municipalities became bilingual or even monolingually-French, and further stimulated the Francization of Brussels. The most controversial language census of 1947 led to an uproar of Flemish protest and the eventual abolition of the controversial language censuses. Finally, the Belgian language border was made permanent in 1963. The remaining 27 Municipalities with language facilities have been a continuous source of controversy in Belgian politics, focusing on the interpretation and legality of the 1997 Peeters directive, which held that the facilities were temporary measures that should eventually be abolished after the French-speaking minorities in the Dutch-language area had sufficiently learnt the Dutch language.
* North Macedonia: The Ohrid Agreement of 13 August 2001 included provisions for altering the official Languages of North Macedonia, with any language spoken by more than 20% of the population becoming co-official with the Macedonian language at the state level and the municipal level. As of 2002, only the Albanian language qualified under this criterion as a co-official language at the state level, and in certain municipalities, and was thus recognised as such.

==Languages lacking recognition in some countries==

These are languages that have the status of a national language and are spoken by the majority population in at least one country, but lack recognition in other countries, even where there is a significant minority linguistic community:
*Albanian – recognized minority language in many countries, including Romania, but not recognized as a minority language in Greece, where 4% of the population are ethnic Albanians.
*Bulgarian – recognized minority language in the Czech Republic (4,300 speakers), but not officially recognized as minority language in Greece.
*German: classified as an official language in Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Switzerland, but as a minority elsewhere in Europe. It is recognised in South Tyrol, but not in France.
*Hungarian: official in Hungary, and co-official in Serbia&#x27;s Vojvodina province (293,000 speakers). It is a recognised minority language in the Czech Republic (14,000 speakers), and in Romania (1,447,544 speakers, 6.7% of the population), in those communities where the Hungarian speakers exceed 20% of the population; in Slovakia (520,000 speakers, approximately 10% of the population); in Slovenia (6,243 speakers in 2002), and in Ukraine (170,000 speakers).
*Macedonian – Macedonian is not recognized as minority language in Greece and Bulgaria.
*Polish – recognized minority language in the Czech Republic (51,000 speakers), but it is not officially recognized as a minority language in Lithuania.
*Romanian: official in Romania and co-official in Vojvodina province, Serbia, with (30,000 speakers), but it does not have official status in Serbia, where another 5300 speakers live outside this province. Note: Ethnologue estimates 250,000 Romanian speakers in Serbia. It is a minority language in northwestern Bulgaria (estimated 10,566 speakers); and in Ukraine (estimated 450,000 speakers).
*Russian: official in Russia, and co-official in Belarus and Kazakhstan. It lacks official status in Estonia and Latvia, likely for historical reasons following Russian dominance during the Soviet Union era. (More than 25% of the population in the latter two nations are Russian speakers).
*Serbian: official in Serbia, and co-official in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. It has minority status in Montenegro, Croatia, North Macedonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Romania. The minority status in Montenegro is controversial because the majority of the population (63.49%) declared Serbian to be their mother tongue. Serbian was an official language there until 2007, when Montenegro ratified a new constitution.

*Turkish: official in Turkey, Turkish Republic of Cyprus and co-official in Cyprus. It has minority status in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, Iraq, and Romania. Apart from these countries, there are native speakers in Bulgaria (8,4% of the population) and Syria (the third most widely used language), but it lacks minority language status.

==Significant languages having no majority of speakers in any country==

Linguistic communities that form no majority of population in any country, but whose language has the status of an official language in at least one country:
*Tamil: 78 million speakers; official status in India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore

*Catalan: 10 million speakers, official status in Andorra, regional official status in Catalonia, the Valencian Community under the name of Valencian, and the Balearic Islands, Spain. Recognized regional language in Italy, and specifically on the island of Sardinia in Alghero. It has no official status in Northern Catalonia, or France.
*Low Saxon: 4.35-7.15 million speakers, a minority language in primarily the Netherlands, and in Germany. 
*Galician: 3–4 million speakers, regional official status in Galicia, Spain.
*Limburgish: 2 million speakers, a minority language in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
*Welsh: 622,000 speakers, regional official status in Wales, UK; minority in Chubut, Argentina, with no legal recognition.

*Māori: 157,110 speakers; official status in New Zealand
*Romansh: 60,000 speakers, official status in Switzerland (Graubünden).
*Cherokee: 2,000 speakers; official status within the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, a sovereign nation
*Scottish Gaelic: 87,000 people with some ability, 57,375 of which are first and second language speakers. Official status in Scotland, UK. 300 native speakers, 2,320 overall in Canada, minority status. About 1,900-speaker minority in the United States.
*Sardinian: 1,350,000 native (first or second language) speakers, more with some knowledge, regional official status in Sardinia 
*Corsican: 125,000 native (first or second language) speakers; regional co-official status in Corsica

Prince Edward Island&quot;: a 2000 Supreme Court of Canada decision which determined that, based on Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in the specific circumstances of a French-language minority in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, the Francophone parents of an estimated potential of 49 to 155 students were entitled to a French-language primary school within town rather than having to bus their children to another Francophone school 57 kilometres away.
* &quot;Casimir v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot;
* &quot;Charlebois v. Saint John (City)&quot;
* &quot;Devine v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot;

==Treasure language==

A treasure language is one of the thousands of small languages still spoken in the world today. The term was proposed by the Rama people of Nicaragua as an alternative to heritage language, indigenous language, and &quot;ethnic language&quot;, names that are considered pejorative in the local context. The term is now also used in the context of public storytelling events.

The term &quot;treasure language&quot; references the desire of speakers to sustain the use of their mother tongue into the future:
Accordingly, the term is distinct from endangered language for which objective criteria are available, or heritage language which describes an end-state for a language where individuals are more fluent in a dominant language.

<text>Castillo San Felipe del Morro (English: Promontory Castle of Saint Philip), most commonly known as El Morro (&quot;The Promontory&quot;), is a large fortress and citadel in the historic district of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico. Commissioned by King Charles I of Spain in 1539, it was first built as a fortified tower in honor of King Philip II, who oversaw its expansion into a hornwork fort by 1595. Over the next 200 years, especially in the reign of King Charles III, &quot;El Morro&quot; continued to be developed to reach its current form in 1787. Rising 140 ft from the Atlantic shoreline with 18 to 25 ft thick walls, the six-leveled edifice stands on a steep, rocky headland promontory on San Juan Islet guarding the entry to San Juan Bay, the harbor of Old San Juan. &quot;El Morro&quot;, alongside La Fortaleza, San Cristóbal, El Cañuelo, and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan, protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico, or &quot;La Llave de las Indias&quot; (The Key to the Indies), from invasion by competing world powers during the Age of Sail. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.

==Development==

Lying on the northwesternmost point of the islet of Old San Juan, Castillo San Felipe del Morro is named in honor of King Philip II of Spain. The fortification, also referred to as &quot;el Morro&quot; or &#x27;the promontory,&#x27; was designed to guard the entrance to the San Juan Bay, and defend the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan from seaborne enemies.

In 1983, the citadel was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in conjunction with the San Juan National Historic Site. Over two million visitors a year explore the &quot;castillo&quot;, making it one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s leading tourist attractions. Facing the structure, on the opposite side of the bay, a smaller fortification known as &quot;El Cañuelo&quot; complemented the castillo&#x27;s defense of the entrance to the bay.

==Structure for deployment==
The construction of the citadel and its surrounding walls began in 1539 on orders of King Charles V of Spain. The original fortress was built under the direction of conquistador Diego Ramos de Orozco and its main purpose was to defend the port of San Juan by controlling the entry to its harbor. In order to have a viable defense while the rest of the fort was being completed, a small proto-fortress was erected during the first year of construction. It is estimated that this section comprises about 10% of the whole structure.

It was not till 1587, however, that Field Marshal Juan de Tejeda and the Italian engineer-architect Juan Bautista Antonelli drew the fort&#x27;s final design. The plan, which was based on the then firmly established Spanish military fortification principles of the time, included fortifying nine other sites in the Spanish Main and Spanish West Indies: Santo Domingo, Santa Marta, Cartagena, Nombre de Dios, Portobelo, the Chagres River, Panama City, Havana, and St. Augustine. San Juan construction began in March 1589 with skilled artisans, 12 stonecutters, 18 masons, 2 smiths, a cooper, metal founder, and an overseer assigned to the task, with the help of 150 slaves. Captain General Diego Menéndez de Valdés, who was the governor of Puerto Rico, took over construction after Tejeda and Antonelli left to start construction of Santo Domingo&#x27;s fortifications. Capt. Pedro de Salazar took over construction in 1591.
The new fortifications consisted of a hornwork, crossing the headland, to protect the landward side of the existing tower and water battery. Two half-bastions, one on the Atlantic side called &quot;Tejeda&quot;, and another on the harbor side called &quot;Austria&quot;, were connected by a curtain wall fronted by a moat, and spanned by a drawbridge in the center. The gate and drawbridge were protected by a ravelin, and just inside the gate was a guardhouse. A pair of batteries behind the hornwork overlooked the sea and harbor.

In 1634, construction of the city walls surrounding San Juan began. By 1650, the town was enclosed on the east, south and west, while natural battlements protected the city along the Atlantic.

In 1765, Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly, Inspector General of Cuba, and Colonel Tomás O&#x27;Daly, San Juan Chief of Engineers, agreed on a plan to strengthen San Juan&#x27;s defenses, which was approved by Charles III of Spain. San Juan became a Defense of the First Order, and one of the most powerful plazas in the Americas by 1790. El Morro&#x27;s improvements included 3 cisterns under the main plaza containing 216,000 gallons of water collected from times of rain. The walls were strengthened to be 18–40 feet thick. These walls consisted of limestone and sandstone blocks forming the exterior and interior, with rubble sandwiched in between. The Santa Bárbara battery became the main battery with 37 cannon, supported by casemate guns at a lower level, and backed by a great wall with casemates at a higher level.

The top of the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro Lighthouse was destroyed during the 1898 bombardment of the city by the United States, and the American flag replaced the Spanish on 18 November 1898.

==History==
===Spanish Rule (1539–1898)===

Upon the advice of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, a battery was constructed on the rocky promontory called &quot;the Morro&quot;, when the location of La Fortaleza was deemed unsuitable. This battery consisted of a tower with 4 embrasures, and a Water Battery at the foot of the slope for 3 guns. By 1555, Morro had 8 bronze cannons, as a defense against French privateers.

During the Spanish government of the island, El Morro, also known as Castillo de San Felipe, survived several attacks from foreign powers on various occasions.

In 1593 Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names.

In 1595, Englishman Sir Francis Drake unsuccessfully attacked San Juan with his fleet in the Battle of San Juan (1595).

In 1598, the English attacked again, led by George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Clifford succeeded because he attacked San Juan over land instead of trying to enter through the San Juan Bay. However, an epidemic of dysentery forced him to flee the island after the Battle of San Juan (1598).
In 1625, the Dutch, led by Boudewijn Hendricksz, also attacked the island emulating George Clifford&#x27;s overland invasion. To the amazement of the citizens, the invaders were able to pass in front of the castle&#x27;s defenders and into the harbor, out of reach of the city&#x27;s cannons. El Morro managed to resist the siege and eventually made the Dutch retire, although the attackers were able to sack and burn the city before leaving the Battle of San Juan (1625).

In 1797, British General Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Henry Harvey, with a force of 7,000–13,000 men, invaded the island of Puerto Rico. Captain General Don Ramón de Castro and his forces repelled the attack. Abercromby and Harvey were defeated in the Battle of San Juan (1797).

El Morro&#x27;s last active fight occurred during a naval bombardment by the United States Navy during the 1898 Spanish–American War, ending the age of naval warfare in the Caribbean, at least in the classical sense. During the Spanish–American War, the castle was attacked at least three times by American naval forces, the largest being the Bombardment of San Juan on May 12, 1898. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, in which Spain ceded ownership of the islands of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States.

===American military occupation (1898–1961)===

El Morro and many other Spanish government buildings in Old San Juan became part of a large U.S. Army post, called Fort Brooke. In the early 20th century, the U.S. military filled up the esplanade (the green space in front of &quot;El Morro&quot;) with baseball diamonds, hospitals, officers&#x27; quarters, an officers&#x27; club and even a golf course.

On March 21, 1915, Lt. Teófilo Marxuach was the officer of the day at the El Morro fortress. The Hamburg America Line cargo liner &quot;Odenwald&quot; tried to leave port without permission from the Customs Collector. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on her, which forced her to stop. The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach are widely regarded to be the first shots fired by the United States in World War I, although the first actual wartime shot fired by the US came on the day war was declared, during the scuttling of SMS &quot;Cormoran&quot; off Guam.

During World War II the United States Army added a massive concrete bunker to the top of El Morro to serve as a Harbor Defense Fire Control Station to direct a network of coastal artillery sites, and to keep watch for German submarines which were ravaging shipping in the Caribbean. A lighthouse, rebuilt by the U.S. Army in 1906–08 is the tallest point on El Morro, standing 180 feet (55 m) above sea level. Flagpoles on El Morro today customarily fly the United States flag, the Puerto Rican flag and the Cross of Burgundy flag, also known in Spanish as las Aspas de Borgoña, a standard which was widely used by Spanish armies around the world from 1506 to 1785.

In 1961, the United States Army officially retired from El Morro. The fort became a part of the National Park Service to be preserved as museums. In 1983, the Castillo and the city walls were declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations. In honor of the Quincentennial of the voyages of Columbus in 1992 the exterior esplanade was cleared of palm trees that had been planted by the U.S. Army in the Fort Brooke era, and restored to the open appearance this &quot;field-of-fire&quot; for El Morro&#x27;s cannon would have had in colonial Spanish times. Parking lots and paved roads were also removed, and the El Morro lighthouse repaired and restored to its original appearance. The 1963 film Thunder Island featured an extensive foot chase and shootout scene filmed at El Morro. El Morro was also used as a film set in the 1996 motion picture &quot;Amistad&quot;. Steven Spielberg used it to represent a fort in Sierra Leone where African slaves were auctioned in 1839. African slave labor was used in addition to local labor to help build the castillo. El Morro was a defensive military fortification and a major component of San Juan&#x27;s harbor defense system. Puerto Rico as such was considered by the Spanish crown as the &quot;Key to the Antilles&quot;; no enemy ship could navigate its waters without fear of capture.

An annual artisans festival is held at the fort every July.

The fort is home to a resident colony of around 200 stray cats that are believed to have been descended from cats introduced either during colonial times or in the mid-20th century as part of rat eradication programs. Following concerns over an increase in their population, in 2023 the National Park Service announced it would contract an animal welfare organization to remove the cats and threatened to hire a pest control agency if it were to fail. However, the plan was suspended following a lawsuit by animal welfare groups in 2024.

*1598 – George Clifford, Duke of Cumberland, attacks from the land side in June of this year, the only time El Morro was taken in battle. English forces move into the fortress, however weakened by dysentery they leave in November.
*1625 – The Dutch under the command of Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin Henrick) attacked and invaded San Juan from the &quot;La Puntilla&quot;. El Morro held out under the leadership of Spanish Governor De Haro and Captain Juan de Amézqueta of the Puerto Rican militia, but the city was sacked and burned.
*1630 – Governor Enrique Enríquez de Sotomayor begins construction of the city walls. Work continues until 1678 to encircle the city completely.

<text>Taylor Square is a public square in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Taylor Square is located beside a major road junction, at the intersection of Bourke, Forbes, Oxford and Flinders Streets. Taylor Square is also on the border of the suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surry Hills.

==Description==
Taylor Square sits at the intersection of Bourke, Forbes, Oxford and Flinders streets above the tunnel section of the Eastern Distributor. The square is named after Sir Allen Taylor (1864–1940), a timber merchant, ship builder and Lord Mayor of Sydney who was responsible for the widening of Oxford Street during his tenure.

The area formerly bound by the traffic of the three streets is popularly known as &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; because of three large palm trees that once occupied the strip, but have since been subsequently removed. The opening of the Eastern Distributor in December 1999 also entailed the realignment of traffic flow in the area. Direct vehicle access across Oxford Street via Bourke Street is no longer possible.

The locality is a centre of the city&#x27;s nightlife, especially for its LGBT community. Two permanent tributes are the large rainbow flag and rainbow crossing, built in 2014 and 2019 respectively.

Darlinghurst Courthouse is an imposing sandstone building on Taylor Square. It was designed by architect Mortimer Lewis (1796–1879) in 1844 and has a Greek Revival style façade. The central block is adapted from an 1823 design in Peter Nicholson&#x27;s The New Practical Builder.

The square also features a large water fountain built into the pavement. This was part of a $5.25 million upgrade, in 2003, including lighting and a grass terrace. The fountain is currently being reviewed for upgrade and repair by the City of Sydney Council.

==History==
Taylor Square was the site of the public execution of John Knatchbull for murder in 1844, with a crowd of 10,000 people reportedly in attendance.

<text>Freedom Force is the name of two fictional teams appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
The original version first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #199 (November 1985) and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr. Freedom Force was a supervillain team, though they occasionally acted in a heroic capacity as well. It was a government-sponsored team composed mainly of Mystique&#x27;s version of Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. They mostly interacted with the X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants, but also repeatedly met the Avengers.

The second team first appeared in &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot; #12 (June 2007) and were created by Dan Slott, Christos N. Gage, and Steve Uy. It was set up as Montana&#x27;s Fifty State Initiative superteam.

==Fictional team biography==
===Mystique&#x27;s Freedom Force===

When mutant and human relationships worsen, Mystique decides that it has become too dangerous for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to continue their current path. She offers the group&#x27;s services to Valerie Cooper, a United States National Security Advisor, in exchange for full pardons. Cooper sees a great opportunity in Mystique&#x27;s offer, but wants the team to prove their loyalty first by arresting the original group&#x27;s founder Magneto. The team accepts, and is renamed &quot;Freedom Force&quot; with the sorceress Spiral added to the team. They attack Magneto at a remembrance ceremony for the Holocaust. Though they meet a decisive defeat at the hands of the X-Men, Magneto decides to surrender himself to Freedom Force.

On their next mission, Spider-Woman is added to the team&#x27;s line-up. When the Avengers are framed by their embittered former member Quicksilver, the U.S. government sends Freedom Force to arrest the Avengers, which they do successfully. Disillusioned and disgusted by her team&#x27;s actions, as well as her own in helping them, Spider-Woman infiltrates the prison where the Avengers are being held, and helps free them. She then leaves Freedom Force permanently. Another three members are added: Crimson Commando, Stonewall and Super Sabre, all World War II veterans who decided to take justice in their own hands and hunt down and execute criminals. When they targeted Storm, they were defeated and turned themselves in. It was thought that the former heroes could be redeemed and they were offered a position on Freedom Force.

Over the next few months, they are given many unpopular tasks, such as enforcing the Mutant Registration Act, arresting the outlaw X-Men, and saving the people of Dallas from an attack by an evil god. Freedom Force clashes with X-Factor and the New Mutants when they learn that Freedom Force is helping the U.S. government forcibly recruit young mutants and potential mutants for training and eventual government service. Freedom Force also assists in apprehending the mutant terrorists Resistants.

Freedom Force also participates in other missions of a more general nature, including the rescue of Senator Robert Kelly from a South American drug syndicate that had kidnapped during a diplomatic visit, as well as helping to contain a jailbreak at the Vault when Truman Marsh was warden.

The team begin to fall apart after the mutant Forge asks them to protect Muir Island against the Reavers. During this mission, Stonewall and Destiny are killed, and Avalanche is severely injured. The death of Destiny especially hits Mystique hard and the team fights the Avengers without her leadership. Shortly after the battle at Muir Island, Cooper is possessed by the Shadow King and ordered to kill Mystique, however, Cooper resists the Shadow King&#x27;s influence and seriously injures herself rather than commit murder. Mystique then assumes Val&#x27;s identity, passing Cooper&#x27;s injured body as her own corpse, and later aids the X-Men and X-Factor as a &quot;mole&quot; among the Shadow King&#x27;s servants.

Without Mystique, the remaining Freedom Force members are sent on a disastrous mission in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, in which Super Sabre is killed and Crimson Commando severely injured. To save Crimson Commando&#x27;s life, Avalanche leaves Pyro and Blob stranded in enemy territory. Avalanche and Crimson Commando, now a cyborg, continue to work for the US government, apparently as covert operations agents. The team is soon replaced by the government team X-Factor, also under Val Cooper&#x27;s supervision.

===Initiative Freedom Force===

After the superhuman &quot;Civil War&quot;, registered superheroes were teamed up and assigned to a state, Montana&#x27;s Fifty State Initiative team is Freedom Force.

This Freedom Force team consists of Cloud 9, Think Tank, Equinox and Spinner, led by the Golden Age hero Challenger.

During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Equinox was revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator who is killed by Cloud 9. Spinner dies soon after while trying to destroy a Skrull weapon system.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, new Initiative leader Norman Osborn orders Freedom Force to attack the Heavy Hitters after they secede from the Initiative. He feels he can trust the team to follow orders due both to Equinox&#x27;s criminal past and to Challenger coming from a time where authority is to be respected and obeyed without question. They help the other Initiative teams to defeat and capture the Heavy Hitters&#x27; leader, Prodigy.

During the Siege of Asgard, Steve Rogers reports that Challenger refused to take part in the attack on Asgard.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, the Freedom Force members appear at a meeting held by Prodigy regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the Earth. Among them is also Spinner, who is inexplicably shown alive.

==Freedom Force trademark==
Marvel Comics abandoned the Freedom Force trademark in the 1990s and it was eventually re-registered by computer game developer Irrational Games, which used it as the name for their own team of comic book heroes (with no connection to Marvel or its characters). These all-new characters were featured in two games and one comic book miniseries (through Image Comics).

==Alternate versions==
An undead version of Freedom Force appears in the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe consisting of Mystique, Pyro, and Avalanche. They are seen in pursuit of the still-living Blob, whom they apprehend and convert into a zombie like themselves. United as a foursome, they then attack the X-Men who defeat and destroy them all.

==In other media==
Freedom Force is alluded in the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; series finale &quot;Ascension&quot;. Professor X caught glimpses of future actions via Apocalypse; one action being the former Brotherhood of Mutants group (Avalanche, Toad, Blob, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch) as well as Pyro standing in front of a S.H.I.E.L.D. sign which foreshadows Freedom Force.

<text>A Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD; Neo-Latin: &quot;Pharmaciae Doctor&quot;) is a professional doctorate in pharmacy. In some countries, it is a proficient graduate degree to practice the profession of pharmacy or to become a clinical pharmacist. In many countries, people with their Doctor of Pharmacy are allowed to practice independently and can prescribe drugs directly to patients. A PharmD program has significant experiential and/or clinical education components in introductory and advanced levels for the safe and effective use of drugs. Experiential education prepares graduates to be practice-ready, as they already have spent a significant amount of time training in areas of direct patient care and research.

===India===

The PharmD degree was introduced by the Government of India and Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) in 2008. It is a post-graduate professional doctorate of 6 years which includes 5 years of study and 1 year of internship or residency. It was introduced to improve clinical pharmacy services in the country and is the only service which is in direct contact with the patient health care system. The first batch of post-baccalaureate PharmD students graduated in August 2011 and the first regular batch graduated in June 2014. The PharmD degree requires 5 years of classroom and hospital-based didactic study (two years didactic post-baccalaureate course), followed by one year of internship training in hospitals in addition to ongoing practicals and finishing a research project.

With reference to the clarification on the PharmD qualification and designation of &quot;Dr.&quot; for graduates, it was clarified to all universities that the PharmD is a post-graduate degree and passing students can directly register for a PhD from 2012. With all the changes made to the degree, it is still only approved by the PCI, as the National Medical Commission (NMC) does not recognize the degree in India. After the Amendment in August 2019, it is now compulsory for hospitals to develop a DIC (Drug Information Centre). It will be head by a PharmD graduate; similarly, another cadre was created, the &quot;Clinical Pharmacist&quot;. The only minimum educational qualification required for the cadre is the PharmD. The Clinical Pharmacist must also assist the physician and other medical representatives to promote the wellness and correct use of medications for patients.

== Europe ==

=== Belgium ===

The education of pharmacists in Belgium requires a minimum of five years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and two master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. Belgium considers the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the Pharm.D. title used in the United States. To become a hospital pharmacist, a three-year residency program has to be completed after obtaining the M.Sc. in pharmaceutical sciences.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===

In both countries, the PharmDr. (Pharmaciae doctor) diploma can be obtained by pharmacists who have previously graduated in pharmacy (Magister, Mgr.) (the undergraduate study of pharmacy takes five years). Applicants must defend a research or experimental thesis, and pass a rigorous examination. The PharmDr. title is highly prestigious and written in front of the name. It is different from the postgraduate Ph.D. degree.

=== France ===

In France, Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination (&quot;concours&quot;, with &quot;numerus apertus&quot;) happening at the end of the first year of health studies. Most candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools (lycée). Yearly success rate depends on the university&#x27;s current &quot;numerus clausus&quot; and the number or registered students, ranging from 10 to 30% bearing in mind that second-time participants are three to four times more likely to succeed than students trying for the first time.

In order to obtain the state diploma of &quot;Doctor of Pharmacy&quot;, the studies last a minimum of six years, or nine years for students choosing residency (hospital pharmacy or medical biology). It is accessible through another competitive exam, even more selective. It lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for &quot;diplôme d&#x27;études spécialisées&quot; ).
Students must specialise when entering the 5th year, and choose between dispensing pharmacy, pharmaceutical industry or hospital residency. In any case, a 12-month part-time hospital externship is mandatory during the fifth year, although some flexibility is possible for students choosing industry.

Sixth year for industry is generally dedicated to further specialisation with a former Professional master&#x27;s degree or a former Research master&#x27;s degree including internship.

In France, since the harmonization of European Union in September 2005, the student who chooses the industry/research orientation have a six-month period of part-time hospital externship, and 3 to 6 months of full-time training in a pharmaceutical industry or a research lab.

=== Hungary ===

In Hungary, pharmacists obtain their master&#x27;s degree, after five years of study. In the fifth year, students must undergo a professional training, that lasts for two+three months (autumn and spring) in a public pharmacy and one month in a hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled for practicing the profession of pharmacy, after acquiring the pharmacist work license. According to the new law in 2008, which is valid from 2009, all pharmacists, who have acquired the master&#x27;s degree of pharmacy, are entitled to the Doctor of Pharmacy.

=== Italy ===

In order to obtain the state diploma of &quot;Doctor of Pharmacy&quot;, the studies last a minimum of 5 years, or 9 years for students choosing residency (hospital pharmacy, medical biology) or pharmacology. In Italy the Professional degree in Pharmacy lasts 5 years, which includes a 6-month professional training in a public pharmacy or hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled to practise as a pharmacist. The subscription to &quot;Pharmacist&#x27;s Order&quot;, or in Italian &quot;Ordine dei Farmacisti&quot;, is required for working in private and public pharmacies or hospitals. It is not required if the pharmacist is working at a pharmaceutical company. Besides the professional degree in pharmacy, the title of Doctor of Pharmacy can be achieved in Italy by obtaining a MSc in Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology (Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutiche, CTF) and then subscribing to the &quot;Pharmacist&#x27;s Order&quot;.

===Malta===

In Malta, the warrant to practice as a pharmacist is given after the Master of Pharmacy course is completed successfully. The University of Malta, however, offers a Level 8 Postgraduate Degree known as the Doctorate in Pharmacy (PharmD) which expands the pharmacist&#x27;s knowledge on clinical, pharmacoeconomic, and regulatory aspects. The Doctorate in Pharmacy course is offered in collaboration with the University of Illinois in Chicago and uses a mixed-approach learning programme including theory and practical experience.

=== Netherlands ===

The education of pharmacists in the Netherlands requires a minimum of six years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and three master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. The Dutch consider the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the PharmD-title in use in the United States. Before the harmonization, a four-year Master of Science was superseded by two more years of university education preparing for pharmacy practice. To become a hospital pharmacist, a four-year residency program has to be completed after that.

=== Portugal ===

In Portugal, studies consists of four years of basic school, five years of preparatory school, and three years of high school, where afterward the student is submitted to nationwide exams for their university application. The process is the same for every degree the student chooses, from medicine to pharmacy to engineering.
The student takes the master&#x27;s degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences (equivalent to the PharmD program) in one of the nine Pharmacy faculties with their own respective numerous clausus which comprises a six-year rigorous study (5 year as an integrated masters according to the EU system) and a professional internship. Finished the degree, the academic title of Doctor of Pharmacy is issued. The graduate can then enroll in the regulatory institution for the Pharmacist profession in Portugal called, &quot;Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society&quot; or, in Portuguese, &quot;Ordem dos Farmacêuticos&quot;. After the enrollment, the title of Pharmacist is issued. Afterwards, Pharmacists can start their career in a limitless number of professional areas that range from community pharmacies, drug development, fundamental or applied research, biotechnology to areas such as forensic sciences, toxicology, regulatory affairs, clinical analysis, law enforcement (scientific police), bromatology, drug marketing, regulatory authorities, university teachers, etc. The Pharmacists can also choose to become a specialist in one of following areas of activity: Pharmaceutical Industry, Regulatory Affairs, Hospital Pharmacy, and Clinical Analysis. Each specialization requires an additional 5-year professional study program guided by a tutor in the respective area of knowledge. This training includes regular evaluations by the professional competent authority (&quot;Ordem dos Farmacêuticos&quot;), which also requires an exam at the end of the 5-year training. After the success at the exam, the Pharmacist then becomes a specialist in its area of expertise.

===Spain===

In Spain, Pharmacy studies can be accessed after completing five and a half years of university college (with at least 6 months of initiation to Pharmacy Practice). The &quot;Licenciado en Farmacia&quot; or &quot;Grado en Farmacia&quot; (equivalent to the PharmD-program) English degree is the only title that allows holders to practice the profession of Pharmacy in Spain. To become a Hospital Pharmacist a person with a degree in Pharmacy must enter a selection process (national selection process called FIR) to initiate a Pharmacy Residency period of professional training during 4 additional years (including one full year of advanced clinical practice in different medical wards). Apart from the professional degrees, like with any other university studies, Pharmacy degree allows holders to pursue an academic career by enrolling master&#x27;s and doctorates programs (MSc and PhD) in several scientific fields (pharmaceutical technology, pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics, biomedical sciences, cosmetics &amp; pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, physical chemistry, food sciences, pharmacology, toxicology, public health, etc.). Master&#x27;s usually lasts 1–2 years and PhD no less than 4 years.

There are other residencies available to pharmacists such as Medical Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology, Microbiology, Radiopharmacy, Pharmaceutical Analysis, and Industrial Pharmacy lasting from 2 to 4 years.

Pharmacists usually work as retail pharmacists (private practice), hospital pharmacists, primary care pharmacists, medical biologists, scientists (private and public biomedical research institutions), as university professors (Pharmacy, Medicine, Biology, Food Sciences, Biochemistry, Veterinary, Nursing, etc.), and as technicians and executive managers (pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and governmental institutions).

===Sweden===

In Sweden, Pharmacy Doctors could be considered equal to those who have earned a master&#x27;s degree in pharmacy and are actively licensed to work as a pharmacist.
The master&#x27;s program typically takes students 5 years to complete, which prepares students for careers in pharmacies, the pharmaceutical industry, and, more recently, clinical pharmacy.
Students who have earned their master&#x27;s degree in pharmacy can also choose to further specialize themselves with a wide range of Ph.D. programs, which are offered at universities in Uppsala, Gothenburg, and Umeå

A special license which is issued by Socialstyrelsen is required in order to work in healthcare as a pharmacist (&quot;i.e.&quot; as a pharmacy clerk or a clinical pharmacist),

Sweden does not refer to licensed and practicing pharmacists as pharmacy &quot;doctors&quot;. Instead, pharmacists refer to themselves as &quot;apotekare&quot; or &quot;farmaceuter&quot;, which is an informal academic title referring to their master&#x27;s degree in pharmacy.

There is a severe shortage of pharmacists in Sweden. In 2018, the shortage was the highest ever.

=== Switzerland ===

The education of pharmacists in Switzerland also follows the EU-harmonisation with three bachelor and two master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. A federal exam is required in addition to the master&#x27;s degree in order to practice. Switzerland considers the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy and the federal degree to be equivalent to the Pharm.D. title used in the United States. The pharmacists have indeed a research and a clinical experience during their degree.

The Lebanese American University awards a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree that is accredited by the ACPE. The program extends over six years (two years of pre-pharmacy and four professional years).

=== Qatar ===

In Qatar, pharmacy degrees are offered by the new College of Pharmacy at Qatar University. Students were accepted into the 5-year BSc (Pharm) program commencing in 2007. Students will be accepted into the final year of the 6-year Pharm.D program in 2011. Accordingly, the first graduates of the Pharm.D program are expected in 2012. The program adopts a Canadian curriculum and received early accreditation by the Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs (CCAPP) in February 2009. This is the first international program to undergo review and receive accreditation by this sole Canadian accreditation agency.

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Started in 2001 at King Abdulaziz University, then in 2005 at Ibn-Sina National College, then 2006 at KFU, then 2007 at Qassim University. In 2008, King Saud University College of Pharmacy at Riyadh, College of Pharmacy at Kharj, and Taif University. In 2009, Almaarefa College started their Pharm.D. program, and Shaqra University in 2011.

The degree duration in Saudi Arabia is six years in total, including one academic year of clinical rotations. According to the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties, if a student graduates with a (minimum six years) Pharm.D. degree, then the graduate has the chance to further develop himself. This can be achieved by taking an Accredited Residency Training Program that is at least one year long (for a total of seven years, minimum). Upon successfully completing both the Residency program and the Pharm.D., the graduate can apply for Professional Equivalent (only equivalent in practice) to the master&#x27;s degree in pharmacy.

The Pharm.D degree is now offered by almost all pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia. This is a transitional period as this degree will replace the conventional Bachelor of pharmacy degree in the near future and the old bachelor&#x27;s degree will be phased out.

===United Arab Emirates===

The Doctor of Pharmacy program started in 2008 by the College of Pharmacy, at Gulf Medical University, Ajman.
and it is accredited by the ministry of education accreditation

== North America ==

=== Canada ===

Currently, in Canada, the BPharm (and not Pharm.D.) is the minimum qualification required to practice pharmacy. In Canada the Pharm.D. program is offered in both English and French, and as a first professional degree as well as a postgraduate degree. Students enrolled in the program must have graduated from a CCAPP (Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs) or an ACPE (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) school with an accredited teaching program or must have obtained a Certificate of Qualification from PEBC.

As of 2007, the PharmD professional degree program in French is offered at the Université de Montréal and, as of 2011, at the Université Laval. The Université de Montréal was the first Canadian university to offer the Pharm.D. program as a first professional degree instead of the BPharm in pharmacy. In 2013, the University of Alberta would be offering a Pharm.D. as a post-professional degree, and a BPharm is required for admission into the program. The University of Toronto replaced their entry-level BPharm curriculum with an entry-to-practice Pharm.D. curriculum in 2011, with approval being granted in 2013.

The PharmD. degree is also offered as an undergraduate professional degree at the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto. However, since 2020, most, if not all Canadian Pharmacy schools have changed their Entry-To-Practice programs that awarded successful graduates with a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences to Entry-To-Practice PharmD as the scope of practice for pharmacists continue to expand and change. Since this change, UBC no longer has a separate 2-year Pharm.D. Program that is offered.

On 23 January 2013, the government of Ontario approved the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo applications for the entry-to-practice Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Students graduating in 2015 was the first cohort under this new undergraduate Pharm.D. program.

Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia) is in progress of transitioning to the Pharm.D. program. Undergraduate applicants will require a minimum two years of prerequisite courses.

In the Fall of 2017, Memorial University of Newfoundland (St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador), also replaced their BPharm program with the Pharm.D. program, with the first graduating class expected in 2022. This program requires one full year of prerequisite courses.

In the Fall of 2018, the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta) replaced their four-year BSc. Pharm program with an entry to practise PharmD. program, also with the first graduating class expected in April 2022. However, since the spring of 2017 the university has offered current BSc. Pharm students the ability to bridge to the PharmD. program. This requires the students to take two extra summer semesters between their third and fourth years, as well as an extra 16 weeks of clinical rotations during their fourth year. Only students graduating between 2018 and 2021 will have had this option. As a result, currently the university is offering 3 possible means to obtain a PharmD degree. That is the 2 year PharmD program for practising pharmacists, those in the PharmD for BSc. Pharm students (PBS), and those in the entry to practise PharmD program. BSc. Pharm students who did not enrol in the PBS program between 2018 and 2021 will be the final students to graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the faculty.

===United States===
The Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is a professional degree that offers opportunities in research, teaching, clinical practice, industry, manufacturing, judicial, and a multitude of other areas. Six pharmacy schools in the U.S. still offer a high school student to enroll directly into the School of Pharmacy for a six-year PharmD. degree. In most other Schools of Pharmacy, after completing the required prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor&#x27;s degree, pharmacy school is another four years. In general, the total collegiate timeline to become an entry-level pharmacist is six to eight years; three to four years undergraduate prerequisite is a bachelor&#x27;s degree then 3 to 4 years (accelerated track) professional doctorate.

Acceptance to a Pharm.D. program is competitive. Along with excellent natural science grades, most schools require students to take a pharmacy college admissions test (PCAT) and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the Pharm.D. program. Due to the extensive admission requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, many pharmacy students complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree before entry to pharmacy school. Some institutions still offer six-year accelerated Pharm.D. programs (similar to six-year MD programs).

Residency is an option that is typically one to two years in length. Graduating candidates typically apply their final year of the Pharm.D. program. The accrediting body for most residency positions is the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Applications are submitted through the Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service; which opens November 3 each residency year. Residency sites interview candidates and a ranking occurs prior to a match process. &quot;The match&quot; is facilitated via the National Matching Services Inc. in conjunction with Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service website portal. A residency is useful; especially for new graduates who do not yet have adequate patient care experience or potentially seeking accelerated and additional experiential training.

An ACPE Accredited doctorate of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is currently the only degree accepted by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to be eligible to &quot;sit&quot; for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX).

==== History ====
Previously, the United States had a five-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in pharmacy. Up until the School of Pharmacy graduating class of 1964, in all states with the exception of a few on the west coast, the requirement to sit for a pharmacy license was four years of a licensed College of Pharmacy concentrating in the practice of pharmacy during much of that time. The incoming class of 1961, in anywhere but the West coast, was required to take a five-year university course, culminating in a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy. In most Schools of Pharmacy, that meant two years pre-pharmacy and three years in the actual School of Pharmacy, with graduation in 1966, although some schools were either 1 and 4 or 3 and 2.

The current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior B.S. in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, hands-on clinical practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include graduating with a Doctor of Pharmacy from an ACPE accredited program, conducting a specified number of hours in internship under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE).

For pharmacy graduates holding the Bachelor of Science degrees currently licensed in the United States wishing to attain the Pharm.D., there are programs available to bridge that gap. These programs are fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), but they are only available to current B.S.Pharm. graduates with a license to practice pharmacy in the United States.

=== Mexico ===
The pharmacy program in Mexico is similar to that of Spain&#x27;s program but differs vastly from its neighbors up north in the United States and Canada.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil the title of pharmacist is awarded after completion of certified graduate studies; while the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate&#x27;s professional license (issued by the regional pharmacy (Conselho Regional de Farmacia)).

Many universities award sub-titles or co-titles including Biochemist and Industrial Pharmacist. University of São Paulo and a few others have awarded specialization titles for many years for their Pharmacy and Biochemistry graduate students, including toxicological and clinical analysis, food and nutrition and industrial pharmacy, which are also equivalent to different degrees in the US and Europe.

Whereas Bachelor of Pharmacy takes a minimum of 4 years, the Pharmacist-Biochemist degree is completed by 4 and 1/2 years of full-time studies with at least 720 hours of internship. The student can opt to get the degree during evening and it takes 6 years with Saturday classes (full day) and also at least 720 hrs of internship.

Although many universities grant a degree of Doctor in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Doctor in Pharmacy after completion of original research dissertation, those are not professional but a post-graduate course and do not grant permission to work as a pharmacist.

=== Chile ===

In Chile, the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 or 11 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University.
The Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree, awarded after finishing 5.5–6 years of study (Bachelor in Pharmacy or Pharmaceutical Sciences), and then finish an internship of 6 months on the specialization area of the student (Pharmaceutical Lab, Community Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy) and/or a scientific thesis. The Chilean pharmacy professional degree of Químico Farmaceutico (Q.F.) is generally equivalent to the degree of PharmD.

The pharmacist can get a Master in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc), of 2 years, or a Doctorate in Pharmacology (PhD), of 4 years after finished the Bachelor. These are Academic Degrees, needed for scientific career on investigation, but are not required to work in other professional areas.

=== Colombia ===

In Colombia, the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University. The Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree. While the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate&#x27;s professional license (issued by the Colegio Nacional de Quimicos Farmaceuticos de Colombia).

<text>Castillo San Cristóbal () is a fortress in the historic district of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, known as the largest fortification built by the Spanish in the New World. Dating back to defense expansions following attacks by the English in 1598 and the Dutch in 1625, it was first built in 1634 as the &quot;Garita del Diablo&quot; (&quot;devil’s sentry box&quot;) and an artillery platform. Over the next 150 years, especially in the reign of King Charles III of Spain, it continued to be developed into a bastion fort to reach its largest size in 1790. Rising 150 ft from the Atlantic shoreline, the three-level edifice stands on a hill at the northern coastline of San Juan Islet, guarding the land entry to Old San Juan. &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;, alongside El Morro, La Fortaleza, and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan, protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico, or &quot;La Llave de las Indias (The Key to the Indies)&quot;, from invasion by competing world powers during the Age of Sail. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983.

== History ==

&quot;Castillo San Cristóbal&quot; was built on a hill originally known as the &quot;Cerro de la Horca&quot; (&quot;gallows Hill&quot;) or the &quot;Cerro del Quemadero&quot; (&quot;burner’s hill&quot;), changed to &quot;Cerro de San Cristóbal&quot; in honor of Saint Christopher, the patron of travelers. The fortress is considered the largest fortification built by Spain in the New World. When it was completed in 1783, it covered about 27 acres. The entrances to it were protected by two gates and drawbridges in what was called the &quot;Revellín de Santiago&quot; (Saint James Ravelin) and the &quot;Bastión de Santiago&quot; (Saint James Bastion). After close to a hundred years of relative peace in the area, this section of the fortification (about a third) was demolished in 1897 to help ease the flow of traffic in and out of the walled city.

In 1634, the first defensive structure had been built in the area, the &quot;Fortín del Espigón&quot; (&quot;breakwater fort&quot;)or the &quot;Garita del Diablo (&quot;devil’s sentry box&quot;)&quot;. In 1765, San Cristóbal was conformed by a hornwork surrounded by a dry moat, which gave continuity to the walls of the city, and at the highest point of it, there was an artillery platform, or &quot;Caballero de San Miguel&quot; (Knight of Saint Michael)&quot;,&quot; for the emplacement of cannons. &quot;San Cristóbal&quot; derives its name from the hill on which the main defenses were built against the invasion of the city by land, although it also defended the north coast. By the time the work was completed, it became, the most extensive Spanish fortification in all of the Americas.

Charles III of Spain came to the Spanish throne in 1759, and in 1764 ordered Field Marshal Alexander O&#x27;Reilly and the engineers, Colonel Tomás O&#x27;Daly and Juan Francisco Mestre, to make the island a stronghold, a defense of the first order. The plans constituted the preparation for a war with England, which seemed inevitable. The order coincided with the Siege of Havana temporarily by the English. As a result of O&#x27;Reily&#x27;s reforms, the &quot;Revellín de San Carlos&quot; (Saint Charles Ravelin) and the counterguard of &quot;La Trinidad&quot; (The Trinity) were built. Further east, a fort called &quot;El Abanico&quot; (The Fan) and a battery overlooking the sea, &quot;La Princesa&quot; (The Princess), were built. By 1788, the year of the king&#x27;s death, the reforms were complete. The defenses proved their effectiveness since in 1797 they helped to repel the invasion of seven thousand English soldiers commanded by the British general Ralph Abercromby.

&quot;Castillo San Cristóbal&quot; also contains five cisterns that were used for the storage of water during the ages of the Spanish Colony. They are extremely large (24 ft tall, 17 ft wide, and 57 ft long) and were used as bomb shelters during World War II.

==Historical timeline==

1521 – San Juan founded by Spanish settlers from Caparra.

1539 – Construction of the first fortified defenses at Castillo San Felipe del Morro and La Fortaleza, with batteries aimed at the harbor entrance.

1595 – The English attack San Juan, led by Sir Francis Drake, 25 ships penetrated the line of fire from El Morro. At the end of the battle the English fled taking some prisoners but no treasure, the reason for which they attacked.

1625 – The Dutch attack and take San Juan from the land side. Construction of some form of defense for San Cristóbal Hill was ordered to prevent other attacks from the land side.

1634 – A small triangular redoubt is built on the high ground known as San Cristóbal on the northeast side of San Juan.

1766–1783 - Main period of construction of San Cristóbal as we see it today under the directions of Royal Engineers Tomás O’Daly and Juan Francisco Mestre.

1787 – An earthquake damages the structure of both San Felipe del Morro and San Cristóbal.

1797 – San Cristóbal helps repel the attack on San Juan from the land side by a British invasion force of 7,000 - 13,000 men commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby. Abercromby&#x27;s forces, one of the largest ever to invade Spanish territories in America, are halted a mile from San Cristóbal at the Escambrón defenses, also known as San Juan&#x27;s First Line of Defense; see Fortín de San Gerónimo.

1824 – María de las Mercedes Barbudo, a political activist who was the first female from Puerto Rico &quot;Independentista&quot;, meaning that she was the first Puerto Rican woman to become an avid advocate of Puerto Rican Independence, and who joined forces with the Venezuelan government, under the leadership of Simon Bolivar, to lead an insurrection against the Spanish colonial forces in Puerto Rico, and was held captive in the fort pending her exile to Cuba.

1855 – Mutiny by the San Cristóbal artillery brigade against the Spanish crown. The Castillo is held by rebels for 24 hours causing panic in the city when the cannons are turned around and aimed at the city.

1897 – A large segment of 18th-century walls is dynamited from San Cristóbal to the harbor docks to allow San Juan to expand.
1898 – On 10 May 1898, the first shot which marked Puerto Rico&#x27;s entry into the Spanish–American War was ordered by Captain Ángel Rivero Méndez is against the USS &quot;Yale&quot; from Castillo San Cristóbal&#x27;s cannon batteries. San Cristóbal&#x27;s gunners duel with US Navy warships during a day-long bombardment on 10 May 1898. Six months later Puerto Rico becomes a US territory by terms of the Treaty of Paris which ends the Spanish–American War.
1942 – Still an active military base when the United States entered World War II, concrete pillboxes and an underground bunker control center are added to the ancient defenses of the Castillo San Cristóbal. Cisterns were to be used as fallout shelters.

1949 – San Juan National Historic Site is established as the most impressive structure in the new world.

1961 – The US Army moves out of the forts of Old San Juan, and they become the jurisdiction of the United States National Park Service, to be preserved solely as museums.

1983 – San Juan National Historic Site is declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations.

==&quot;Garita del Diablo&quot;==

Most of San Juan&#x27;s fortified walls have guerites (sentry boxes, &quot;garitas&quot; in Spanish) at various points. One of the guerites at &quot;San Cristóbal&quot; is called &quot;Garita del Diablo&quot; (&quot;devil&#x27;s sentry box&quot;). It offers a vantage point to watchmen guarding the seashore while protecting them. This particular sentry box is one of the oldest parts of the fort, being built in 1634.

There are several legends surrounding the sentry box about soldiers disappearing from inside. However, it is mostly believed – and told so in various local stories – that the only soldier that apparently disappeared was a soldier called Sánchez, who fled his post to escape with his girlfriend, called Dina.

<doc id="707775" wikidata="Q2388343" url="?curid=707775" title="Freedom Force (2002 video game)">
<text>Freedom Force is a real-time tactical role-playing game developed by Irrational Games and published by Electronic Arts and Crave Entertainment in 2002. The player guides a team of superheroes as they defend Patriot City from a variety of villains, monsters, and other menaces. The game&#x27;s budget was around $2 million. A sequel, &quot;Freedom Force vs The 3rd Reich&quot;, was self-published in early March 2005. The games were made available on Steam on May 29, 2009.

==Setting==
Players control the character Mentor across a series of locations and time periods in pursuit of and in contest with the game&#x27;s primary antagonist, Lord Dominion. The game begins with a fight between Lord Dominion and Mentor resulting in the latter&#x27;s ship exploding, releasing a substance named &quot;Energy X&quot; over the game&#x27;s primary setting, Patriot City. The substance acts as a context specific agent that grants an individual superpowers based upon their personality or the environment wherein they made contact with the substance. This substance, &quot;Energy X&quot; acts as the driving plot device for the game as it generates allies for Mentor along with new environments for the player to pursue and fight Lord Dominion. Mentor&#x27;s first ally and the first playable hero is Minuteman a.k.a. Frank Stiles, who seeks to protect the city from the Red Menace before becoming involved in the real plot.
==Development==
The game used the NetImmerse game engine.

From January to June 2005, the story of the first &quot;Freedom Force&quot; game was retold in a six-issue comic book miniseries published by Image Comics. This series was scripted by Eric Dieter and featured Jack Kirby-influenced artwork by Tom Scioli. Dieter also wrote the series &quot;Bible&quot; and served as community manager for the official website&#x27;s forum, &quot;Freedom Fans&quot;.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best computer game of March 2002.

&quot;Freedom Force&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award.

It also received the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Voice Acting&quot; award. &quot;GameSpot&quot; presented it with its annual &quot;Best Story on PC&quot; prize. &quot;Freedom Force&quot; was also nominated for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;2002 Best Roleplaying Game&quot;, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Best Strategy Game for PC&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Best Music on PC&quot;, &quot;Biggest Surprise on PC&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic) on PC&quot; awards.

<doc id="707779" wikidata="Q3357747" url="?curid=707779" title="Ottawa South (federal electoral district)">
<text>Ottawa South () is a federal electoral district in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by David McGuinty, brother of former Premier of Ontario and Ottawa South MPP Dalton McGuinty. It has been held continuously by Liberal candidates since it was first contested in 1988, and is regarded as one of the strongest Liberal ridings in Canada. Ottawa South is a suburban, generally middle class riding, notable for having the highest Arab population in Ontario.

==Geography==
The riding is located within the city of Ottawa. It is bounded on the north and east by Highway 417, on the west by the Rideau River and on the south by a line beginning at the Rideau River and Hunt Club Road, then east to Limebank Road, south to Leitrim Road, east to the CP Rail line, north to Lester Road, then east along Lester and Davidson Road to Conroy Road, north to Hunt Club Road and east along Hunt Club and its prolongation to Highway 417. Neighbouring districts include Ottawa—Vanier to the north, Orléans to the east, Carleton to the south and Ottawa West—Nepean and Ottawa Centre to the west.

Ottawa South comprises the neighbourhoods of Riverview, Eastway Gardens, Alta Vista, Riverside Park, Billings Bridge, Heron Park, Mooney&#x27;s Bay, Hunt Club Woods, Hunt Club Estate, Hunt Club Chase, South Keys, Ellwood, Heron Gate, Sheffield Glen, Airport-Uplands, Elizabeth Park, Windsor Park Village, and Blossom Park in the city of Ottawa. The total area is 76 km2. There are 233 polling divisions.

==Party support==
The Liberal Party has held the riding since its creation in 1988. The closest election was a 7% Liberal win in 2006. The riding has voted Liberal even during Progressive Conservative and Conservative governments.
The New Democratic Party received its greatest level of support in the 2021 election at 19%. The Greens saw their highest vote here in 2008 with 7%.

==Political geography==

The Liberals have support in most parts of the riding. In the 2004 election, the strongest Liberal areas were in the Alta Vista neighbourhood. However, in the 2006 election, they lost some of this support, but it was gained from lower income areas such as Heron Gate. By 2008, the Liberals had gained much of their support back in Alta Vista.

The Conservatives have their strongest amount in the southern parts of the riding, especially in the community of Blossom Park and around the Macdonald-Cartier International Airport By 2006, the Conservatives had won the neighbourhood of Elmvale Acres, but this was lost in 2008. The New Democrats have only won one poll in recent memory, and that was a poll in Heron Gate in 2004. 

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 52.2% White, 14.7% Black, 12.4% Arab, 4.9% South Asian, 3.6% Indigenous, 3.3% Chinese, 2.2% Filipino, 1.8% Latin American, 1.6% West Asian, 1.2% Southeast Asian, 
Languages: 51.1% English, 10.6% French, 9.7% Arabic, 2.1% Somali, 1.8% Spanish, 1.5% Mandarin, 1.0% Italian, 1.0% Tagalog 
Religions: 51.1% Christian (28.0% Catholic, 3.4% Anglican, 3.1% Christian Orthodox, 2.7% United Church, 1.3% Pentecostal, 12.6% Other), 18.1% Muslim, 1.6% Hindu, 1.1% Jewish, 25.9% None
Median income: $42,000 (2020)
Average income: $55,600 (2020)

==Riding associations==

Riding associations are the local branches of national political parties:

The list of registered riding associations is available from Elections Canada.
==History==
The district was created in 1987. 65.7% was from Ottawa—Carleton, 20.1% from Ottawa Centre and 14.2% from Ottawa—Vanier. At the time, it was bounded on the west by the Rideau River, on the north by the Queensway, on the east by the city limits at the time, and on the south by the following line (from west to east beginning at the Rideau River): Ottawa city limits, River Road, Limebank Road, Leitrim Road, Canadian Pacific Railway, Lester Road (allowance for a road between lots 10 and 11, Concession 3 in Gloucester Township, Albion Road, Walkley Road.

===1996 Redistribution===

Following the 1996 redistribution, the riding added the neighbourhood of Hunt Club Park from Carleton—Gloucester, by changing the southeastern boundary to the city limits at the time (from Walkley to Conroy).

===2003 Redistribution===

Following the 2003 redistribution, the riding&#x27;s eastern boundary was changed to Highway 417 from the former city limits. The boundary would follow Highway 417 from the Rideau River until Hunt Club Road. This shift added in a small piece of territory that was in Ottawa—Vanier and Ottawa—Orléans riding.

===2012 Redistribution===

Only a minor change to the riding&#x27;s boundaries occurred followed the 2012 redistribution of Canada&#x27;s ridings. Ottawa South lost all of its territory south of Hunt Club Road and West of Riverside Drive. This area, which only had 27 people as of the Canada 2011 Census was transferred to the new riding of Carleton.

===2022 Redistribution===

The 2022 Federal Redistribution pushed the riding boundaries southward to encompass the growing neighbourhood of Findlay Creek, formerly part of the &quot;Carleton&quot; riding. The new boundaries will be in effect for the next Federal election to be held no later than 2025.

It also took away the north-west corner of the riding. The area between the &quot;Rideau River&quot; and &quot;Bank St&quot; in the east to the Railway Tracks to the south, encompassing the neighbourhoods of Riverside Park, Billings Bridge and Heron Park were moved to the Ottawa Centre riding.

==Members of Parliament==

The riding has elected the following members of Parliament:






===Current member of Parliament===
The member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa South is David McGuinty, a former businessman, immigration officer, lawyer and professor. He was first elected in 2004. He is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Election results==
===Next===
The Conservatives have nominated police officer Blair Turner to be their candidate. He is the son of former Progressive Conservative MP for Ottawa—Carleton Barry Turner.



===2021===
Incumbent Liberal MP David McGuinty faced a re-match against local businessman Eli Tannis of the Conservative Party. The NDP ran national security expert Huda Mukbil. McGuinty easily won re-election with a slightly reduced majority, while the NDP had its strongest federal result in the riding&#x27;s history, besting its prior high-water mark in 2011.
===2019===
Incumbent MP David McGuinty ran for re-election, and was challenged by Conservative Eli Tannis, a Lebanese-Canadian entrepreneur, New Democrat Morgan Gay, a community organizer and Green Les Schram, a self employed consultant. Despite winning 5,000 fewer votes than he had four years earlier, he easily held off the challenge from his nearest (Conservative) rival, with more than double the latter&#x27;s total.

===2015===
While the Liberals were the third party in Parliament, David McGuinty served as the Liberal Party&#x27;s critic for Natural Resources (2011–2012), Industry (2013) and the Privy Council Office (2013–2015). He was easily re-elected in 2015 when the Liberals were swept into power. He defeated the Conservative candidate, Dev Balkissoon, a consulting firm owner by over 23,000 votes. Balkissoon was criticized during the campaign for missing an all-candidates debate. The NDP candidate was George Brown, a former Ottawa City councillor for Riverside Ward (1985–1994), and the Green candidate was John Redins, a disabilities rights activist.







===2011===

While in opposition, McGuinty was promoted to the position of the Official Opposition House leader. Once again, he faced and defeated Elie Salibi, the Conservative candidate. McGuinty was one of only 34 Liberals elected to the House of Commons in the election, and both he and Salibi saw a reduction in their percentage of votes. The NDP candidate, James McLaren, a teacher, had the second best (after 2021) performance for the NDP in riding history, despite a mid-campaign controversy regarding comments he made on Facebook.





===2008===

In opposition, McGuinty served as the Liberal Party&#x27;s environment critic. He faced nominal opposition from three lesser-known candidates. The Conservative candidate was Elie Salibi, the director of international sales with Corel, who was born in Lebanon. The NDP candidate was Hijal De Sarkar, a Carleton University political science student of Bengali descent. The Green candidate was Qais Ghanem, a doctor, born in Yemen. Former Libertarian Party leader Jean-Serge Brisson also ran, as well as Al Gullon, the Progressive Canadian candidate. Facing lower turnout in the riding itself, as well as nationwide, and a strong lack of enthusiasm for the Liberal leader Stéphane Dion, McGuinty was able to increase his vote total, and his lead over his closest opponent, from the 2006 election. McGuinty just barely missed the 50% mark, but was nonetheless re-elected handily in Ottawa South.




====Nomination contests====



===2006===

David McGuinty was re-elected after two years as a Liberal backbencher. The race was expected to be closer than 2004, which it was, as McGuinty faced a tough challenge from Conservative Allan Cutler. Cutler was the whistleblower in the Liberal Sponsorship Scandal which saw millions of dollars of public funds transferred to Liberal friendly firms in Quebec during the Chrétien era. The margin of victory between the liberal and his conservative challenger was closer than in 2004, but McGuinty eventually came out on top. Cutler himself was painted as a hypocrite as he would not address the issue of his nomination. Accusations started that 2004 candidate Alan Riddell was given $50,000 not to stand for nomination in the race. Riddell was also pushed aside in an earlier nomination race that saw former MP Barry Turner acclaimed, but would later drop out, forcing a new race. Running for the NDP was the Lebanese-born economist Henri Sader who faced a difficult challenge holding on to the votes that Monia Mazigh won in the previous election. Running again for Greens again was John Ford who failed to hold on to his votes, and running for the Progressive Canadian Party again was Brad Thomson who lost votes as well. Thomson had all but dropped out however, endorsing McGuinty. The Marijuana Party planned to run Tim Meehan, but he did not gain ballot access.

====Nomination contests====

Barry Turner was acclaimed for the nomination when Allan Riddell, the party&#x27;s candidate in 2004, withdrew because of allegations about a prank in which he was involved in university. The party later cancelled Turner&#x27;s nomination and called a new meeting. Turner was not able to get an answer from the party about why the nomination was cancelled, and decided against seeking the nomination again. Allan Cutler announced that he would seek the nomination.



===2004===

The riding&#x27;s boundaries had very little change. 99.7% of the riding remained intact, taking 0.3% from Ottawa-Vanier. John Manley retired prior to the 2004 election. He was among a number of high-profile Liberals to retire who were known to be Jean Chrétien loyalists. David McGuinty, a lawyer and brother of Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty, won the Liberal nomination. He was known to be a friend of Prime Minister Paul Martin. McGuinty faced a steep challenge from Alan Riddell, another lawyer, and Monia Mazigh, the NDP candidate. Riddell, the Conservative candidate, had suffered bad press when it was discovered he had been driving with a suspended license. Mazigh, who lived in Nepean, was another high-profile candidate, being the wife of Maher Arar, who was wrongly accused of terrorism. McGuinty suffered too, as his brother&#x27;s government was unpopular at the time, but in the end was victorious.

^ Canadian Alliance change compares to the vote total for the Reform Party candidate in 1997.

===1997===
Before the 1997 election, the riding changed its boundaries slightly. The old 1987 version encompassed 95% of the new 1996 version. The remaining 5% came from nearby Carleton-Gloucester. John Manley, now the Minister of Industry was once again re-elected. He faced opposition from the Somali community in the riding for his indifference to their needs and concerns. This did not have enough impact, however, and Manley won again with another massive majority. He defeated Carla Marie Dancey, the Reform Party candidate who lived outside the riding. Also running was Keith Beardsley, a staffer to MP Gerry Weiner. Many attribute Manley&#x27;s victory to attracting business to Ottawa&#x27;s high tech sector.

===1993===
Manley was re-elected, as part of a landslide victory for the opposition Liberals. He defeated consulting engineer Doug Walkinshaw of the Reform Party. Joe Anton, the Progressive Conservative candidate, an auditor for Revenue Canada defeated the former mayor of Kanata for the Tory nomination. Ursule Critoph, an economist, was the NDP candidate.

===1988===

Barry Turner was the Progressive Conservative incumbent MP going into the 1988 election. He had previously been the MP for the Ottawa—Carleton riding. As an MP, Turner had a reputation as a hard working MP. However, he would end up being defeated by John Manley, a lawyer with a specialty in tax law. Many attribute the loss to a phone and mail campaign by the Public Service Alliance of Canada, which was upset at the Progressive Conservative Government&#x27;s cuts to the civil service.

<doc id="707780" wikidata="Q902931" url="?curid=707780" title="Dead Letters">
<text>Dead Letters is the fifth album by Finnish band The Rasmus released in 2003. It was released later in 2004 in the US, UK and Australia. Their previous album, &quot;Into&quot;, had seen some success in some parts of Europe, particularly Scandinavia and Germany, but &quot;Dead Letters&quot; signified the band&#x27;s major break-through. The album received 8 Gold and 6 Platinum music certification awards. Lead single &quot;In the Shadows&quot; received 6 gold and 2 platinum awards, selling over 1 million copies and breaking the record for performance royalties received abroad on a Finnish composition (overtaking the works of Jean Sibelius).

==Making of the album==

The Rasmus recorded &quot;Dead Letters&quot; in June–December 2002 at Nord Studios in Sweden, reuniting with Mikael Nord Andersen and Martin Hansen, who had produced their Scandinavian hit album &quot;Into&quot;.

Lead singer Lauri Ylönen explained the title of the album on the band&#x27;s website. &quot;Each song is a letter to somebody. It could be an apology, confession or cry out for help&quot;. The back side of the album booklet reads:
==Critical reception==
Allmusic rated the album 3 stars out of 5. The review said &quot;This Finnish group is more than capable of presenting dark and moody yet very finely tuned rock songs&quot;. It rated the best tracks as &quot;Time to Burn&quot;, &quot;Not Like the Other Girls&quot; and the re-recording of &quot;F-F-F-Falling&quot;, of which the original version appears on the &quot;Into&quot; album, and was added to the UK release as a bonus track.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Dead Letters&quot; was released in Europe in early 2003. It reached the top of the album charts in Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as in Finland, where it stayed in the Top 20 Album chart for over a year. The album was released in the UK in 2004, being the first record to be released in the country by the band, and was one of the Top 50 best-selling albums of 2004. Commercial success in Europe led to the release of the album in other parts of the world. &quot;Dead Letters&quot; and lead single &quot;In the Shadows&quot; both reached the Top 50 of the Australian ARIA charts in 2004, as well as the Top 20 of the American Billboard Heatseeker charts.

The Rasmus received numerous music awards across Europe, winning the &#x27;Best Nordic Act&#x27; category in the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, and five Finnish EMMA awards for Best Group, Best Album, Best Video (In My Life), Best Artist and Export in 2004. The band also won an ECHO award for best international newcomer and were awarded &quot;Best International Artist&quot; at the 2004 MTV Russia Music Awards. &quot;In The Shadows&quot; was on the nominations list for the 2004 Kerrang! Award for Best Single.

<doc id="707785" wikidata="Q8055111" url="?curid=707785" title="Nasal polyp">
<text>Nasal polyps are noncancerous growths within the nose or sinuses. Symptoms include trouble breathing through the nose, loss of smell, decreased taste, post nasal drip, and a runny nose. The growths are sac-like, movable, and nontender, though face pain may occasionally occur. They typically occur in both nostrils in those who are affected. Complications may include sinusitis and broadening of the nose.
The exact cause is unclear. They may be related to chronic inflammation of the lining of the sinuses. They occur more commonly among people who have allergies, cystic fibrosis, aspirin sensitivity, or certain infections. The polyp itself represents an overgrowth of the mucous membranes. Diagnosis may be accomplished by looking up the nose. A CT scan may be used to determine the number of polyps and help plan surgery.
Treatment is typically with steroids, often in the form of a nasal spray. If this is not effective, surgery may be considered. The condition often recurs following surgery; thus, continued use of a steroid nasal spray is often recommended. Antihistamines may help with symptoms but do not change the underlying disease. Antibiotics are not required for treatment unless an infection occurs.
About 4% of people currently have nasal polyps while up to 40% of people develop them at some point in their life. They most often occur after the age of 20 and are more frequent in males than females. Nasal polyps have been described since the time of the Ancient Egyptians.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of polyps include nasal congestion, sinusitis, loss of smell, thick nasal discharge, facial pressure, nasal speech, and mouth breathing. Recurrent sinusitis can result from polyps. Long-term, nasal polyps can cause destruction of the nasal bones and broadening of the nose.

As polyps grow larger, they eventually prolapse into the nasal cavity, resulting in symptoms. The most prominent symptoms of nasal polyps is blockage of the nasal passage. People with nasal polyps due to aspirin intolerance often have a disease known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, which consists of asthma and chronic nasal polyps along with a hypersensitivity reaction to aspirin.

==Causes==

The exact cause of nasal polyps is unclear. They are, however, commonly associated with conditions that cause long term inflammation of the sinuses. This includes chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and cystic fibrosis.

Various additional diseases associated with polyp formation include:
Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common medical condition characterized by symptoms of sinus inflammation lasting at least 12 weeks. The cause is unknown and the role of microorganisms remains unclear. It can be classified as either with or without nasal polyposis.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of nasal polyps in children. Therefore, any child under 12 to 20 years old with nasal polyps should be tested for CF. Half of people with CF will experience extensive polyps leading to nasal obstruction and requiring aggressive management.

==Pathophysiology==
The true cause of nasal polyps is unknown, but they are thought to be due to recurrent infection or inflammation. Polyps arise from the lining of the sinuses. Nasal mucosa, particularly in the region of middle meatus becomes swollen due to collection of extracellular fluid. This extracellular fluid collection causes polyp formation and protrusion into the nasal cavity or sinuses. Polyps which are sessile in the beginning become pedunculated due to gravity.

In people with nasal polyps due to aspirin or NSAID sensitivity, the underlying mechanism is due to disorders in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Exposure to cycloxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and NSAIDs leads to shunting of products through the lipoxygenase pathway leading to an increased production of products that cause inflammation. In the airway, these inflammatory products lead to symptoms of asthma such as wheezing as well as nasal polyp formation.

==Diagnosis==

Nasal polyps can be seen on physical examination inside of the nose and are often detected during the evaluation of symptoms. On examination, a polyp will appear as a visible mass in the nostril. Some polyps may be seen with anterior rhinoscopy (looking in the nose with a nasal speculum and a light), but frequently, they are farther back in the nose and must be seen by nasal endoscopy. Nasal endoscopy involves passing a small, rigid camera with a light source into the nose. An image is projected onto a screen in the office so the doctor can examine the nasal passages and sinuses in greater detail. The procedure is not generally painful, but the person can be given a spray decongestant and local anesthetic to minimize discomfort.

Attempts have been made to develop scoring systems to determine the severity of nasal polyps. Proposed staging systems take into account the extent of polyps seen on endoscopic exam and the number of sinuses affected on CT imaging. This staging system is only partially validated, but in the future, may be useful for communicating the severity of disease, assessing treatment response, and planning treatment.

===Types===
There are two primary types of nasal polyps: ethmoidal and antrochoanal. Ethmoidal polyps arise from the ethmoid sinuses and extend through the middle meatus into the nasal cavity. Antrochoanal polyps usually arise in the maxillary sinus and extend into the nasopharynx and represent only 4–6% of all nasal polyps.

However, antrochoanal polyps are more common in children comprising one-third of all polyps in this population. Ethmoidal polyps are usually smaller and multiple while antrochoanal polyps are usually single and larger.

===CT scan===
CT scan can show the full extent of the polyp, which may not be fully appreciated with physical examination alone. Imaging is also required for planning surgical treatment. On a CT scan, a nasal polyp generally has an attenuation of 10–18 Hounsfield units, which is similar to that of mucus. Nasal polyps may have calcification.

===Histology===
On histologic examination, nasal polyps consist of hyperplastic edematous (excess fluid) connective tissue with some seromucous glands and cells representing inflammation (mostly neutrophils and eosinophils). Polyps have virtually no neurons. Therefore, the tissue that makes up the polyp does not have any tissue sensation and the polyp itself will not be painful. In early stages, the surface of the nasal polyp is covered by normal respiratory epithelium, but later it undergoes metaplastic change to squamous type epithelium with the constant irritation and inflammation. The submucosa shows large intercellular spaces filled with serous fluid.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other disorders can mimic the appearance of nasal polyps and should be considered if a mass is seen on exam. Examples include encephalocele, glioma, inverted papilloma, and cancer. Early biopsy is recommended for unilateral nasal polyps to rule out more serious conditions such as cancer, inverted papilloma, or fungal sinusitis.
==Treatment==
The first line of treatment for nasal polyps is topical steroids. Steroids decrease the inflammation of the sinus mucosa to decrease the size of the polyps and improve symptoms. Topical preparations are preferred in the form of a nasal spray but are often ineffective for people with many polyps. Steroids by mouth often provide drastic symptom relief, but should not be taken for long periods of time due to their side effects. Because steroids only shrink the size and swelling of the polyp, people often have recurrence of symptoms once the steroids are stopped. Decongestants do not shrink the polyps, but can decrease swelling and provide some relief. Antibiotics are only recommended if the person has a co-occurring bacterial infection.

In people with nasal polyps caused by aspirin or NSAIDs, avoidance of these medications will help with symptoms. Aspirin desensitization has also been shown to be beneficial.

===Surgery===
Endoscopic sinus surgery, advocated and popularized by Professor Stammberger, is often very effective for most people, providing rapid symptom relief. Endoscopic sinus surgery is minimally-invasive and is done entirely through the nostril with the help of a camera. Surgery should be considered for those with complete nasal obstruction, uncontrolled runny nose, nasal deformity caused by polyps or continued symptoms despite medical management. Surgery serves to remove the polyps as well as the surrounding inflamed mucosa, open obstructed nasal passages, and clear the sinuses. This not only removes the obstruction caused by the polyps themselves, but allows medications such as saline irrigations and topical steroids to become more effective. It has been suggested that one of the main objectives in sinus surgery for polyps is to allow delivery of the steroids into those areas of the sinuses where polyps develop, namely, the ethmoid sinuses. Specially designed long nozzles had been developed to use postoperatively to deliver steroids into those areas after sinus surgery for polyps.

Surgery lasts approximately 45 to 60 minutes and can be done under general or local anesthesia. Most people tolerate the surgery without much pain, though this can vary from person to person. The person should expect some discomfort, congestion, and drainage from the nose in the first few days after surgery, but this should be mild. Complications from endoscopic sinus surgery are rare, but can include bleeding and damage to other structures in the area including the eye or brain.

Many physicians recommend a course of oral steroids prior to surgery to reduce mucosal inflammation, decrease bleeding during surgery, and help with visualization of the polyps. Nasal steroid sprays should be used preventatively after surgery to delay or prevent recurrence. People often have recurrence of polyps even following surgery. Therefore, continued follow up with a combination of medical and surgical management is preferred for the treatment of nasal polyps.

== Epidemiology ==
Nasal polyps resulting from chronic rhinosinusitis affect approximately 4.3% of the population. Nasal polyps occur more frequently in men than women and are more common as people get older, increasing drastically after the age of 40.

Of people with chronic rhinosinusitis, 10% to 54% also have allergies. An estimated 40% to 80% of people with sensitivity to aspirin will develop nasal polyposis. In people with cystic fibrosis, nasal polyps are noted in 37% to 48%.

<text>A brushless DC electric motor (BLDC), also known as an electronically commutated motor, is a synchronous motor using a direct current (DC) electric power supply. It uses an electronic controller to switch DC currents to the motor windings producing magnetic fields that effectively rotate in space and which the permanent magnet rotor follows. The controller adjusts the phase and amplitude of the current pulses that control the speed and torque of the motor. It is an improvement on the mechanical commutator (brushes) used in many conventional electric motors.

The construction of a brushless motor system is typically similar to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), but can also be a switched reluctance motor, or an induction (asynchronous) motor. They may also use neodymium magnets and be outrunners (the stator is surrounded by the rotor), inrunners (the rotor is surrounded by the stator), or axial (the rotor and stator are flat and parallel).

The advantages of a brushless motor over brushed motors are high power-to-weight ratio, high speed, nearly instantaneous control of speed (rpm) and torque, high efficiency, and low maintenance. Brushless motors find applications in such places as computer peripherals (disk drives, printers), hand-held power tools, and vehicles ranging from model aircraft to automobiles. In modern washing machines, brushless DC motors have allowed replacement of rubber belts and gearboxes by a direct-drive design.

==Background==
Brushed DC motors were invented in the 20th century and are still common. Brushless DC motors were made possible by the development of solid-state electronics in the 1960s.

An electric motor develops torque by keeping the magnetic fields of the rotor (the rotating part of the machine) and the stator (the fixed part of the machine) misaligned. One or both sets of magnets are electromagnets, made of a coil of wire wound around an iron core. DC running through the wire winding creates the magnetic field, providing the power that runs the motor. The misalignment generates a torque that tries to realign the fields. As the rotor moves, and the fields come into alignment, it is necessary to move either the rotor&#x27;s or stator&#x27;s field to maintain the misalignment and continue to generate torque and movement. The device that moves the fields based on the position of the rotor is called a commutator.

=== Brush commutator ===
In brushed motors this is done with a rotary switch on the motor&#x27;s shaft called a commutator. It consists of a rotating cylinder or disc divided into multiple metal contact segments on the rotor. The segments are connected to conductor windings on the rotor. Two or more stationary contacts called &quot;brushes&quot;, made of a soft conductor such as graphite, press against the commutator, making sliding electrical contact with successive segments as the rotor turns. The brushes selectively provide electric current to the windings. As the rotor rotates, the commutator selects different windings and the directional current is applied to a given winding such that the rotor&#x27;s magnetic field remains misaligned with the stator and creates a torque in one direction.

The brush commutator has disadvantages that has led to a decline in use of brushed motors. These disadvantages are:
*The friction of the brushes sliding along the rotating commutator segments causes power losses that can be significant in a low power motor.
*The soft brush material wears down due to friction, creating dust, and eventually the brushes must be replaced. This makes commutated motors unsuitable for low particulate or sealed applications like hard disk motors, and for applications that require maintenance-free operation. 
*The electrical resistance of the sliding brush contact causes a voltage drop in the motor circuit called , which consumes energy. 
*The repeated abrupt switching of the current through the inductance of the windings causes sparks at the commutator contacts, which is a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres and a source of electronic noise, which can cause electromagnetic interference in nearby microelectronic circuits.

During the last hundred years, high-power DC brushed motors, once the mainstay of industry, were replaced by alternating current (AC) synchronous motors. Today, brushed motors are used only in low-power applications or where only DC is available, but the above drawbacks limit their use even in these applications.

=== Brushless solution ===
In brushless DC motors, an electronic controller replaces the brush commutator contacts. An electronic sensor detects the angle of the rotor and controls semiconductor switches such as transistors that switch current through the windings, either reversing the direction of the current or, in some motors turning it off, at the correct angle so the electromagnets create torque in one direction. The elimination of the sliding contact allows brushless motors to have less friction and longer life; their working life is limited only by the lifetime of their bearings.

Brushed DC motors develop a maximum torque when stationary, linearly decreasing as velocity increases. Some limitations of brushed motors can be overcome by brushless motors; they include higher efficiency and lower susceptibility to mechanical wear. These benefits come at the cost of potentially less rugged, more complex, and more expensive control electronics.

A typical brushless motor has permanent magnets that rotate around a fixed armature, eliminating problems associated with connecting current to the moving armature. An electronic controller replaces the commutator assembly of the brushed DC motor, which continually switches the phase to the windings to keep the motor turning. The controller performs similar timed power distribution by using a solid-state circuit rather than the commutator system.

Brushless motors offer several advantages over brushed DC motors, including high torque to weight ratio, increased efficiency producing more torque per watt, increased reliability, reduced noise, longer lifetime by eliminating brush and commutator erosion, elimination of ionizing sparks from the commutator, and an overall reduction of electromagnetic interference (EMI). With no windings on the rotor, they are not subjected to centrifugal forces, and because the windings are supported by the housing, they can be cooled by conduction, requiring no airflow inside the motor for cooling. This in turn means that the motor&#x27;s internals can be entirely enclosed and protected from dirt or other foreign matter.

Brushless motor commutation can be implemented in software using a microcontroller, or may alternatively be implemented using analog or digital circuits. Commutation with electronics instead of brushes allows for greater flexibility and capabilities not available with brushed DC motors, including speed limiting, microstepping operation for slow and fine motion control, and a holding torque when stationary. Controller software can be customized to the specific motor being used in the application, resulting in greater commutation efficiency.

The maximum power that can be applied to a brushless motor is limited almost exclusively by heat; too much heat weakens the magnets and damages the windings&#x27; insulation.

When converting electricity into mechanical power, brushless motors are more efficient than brushed motors primarily due to the absence of brushes, which reduces mechanical energy loss due to friction. The enhanced efficiency is greatest in the no-load and low-load regions of the motor&#x27;s performance curve.

Environments and requirements in which manufacturers use brushless-type DC motors include maintenance-free operation, high speeds, and operation where sparking is hazardous (i.e. explosive environments) or could affect electronically sensitive equipment.

The construction of a brushless motor resembles a stepper motor, but the motors have important differences in implementation and operation. While stepper motors are frequently stopped with the rotor in a defined angular position, a brushless motor is usually intended to produce continuous rotation. Both motor types may have a rotor position sensor for internal feedback. Both a stepper motor and a well-designed brushless motor can hold finite torque at zero RPM.

==Controller implementations==
Because the controller implements the traditional brushes&#x27; functionality, it needs to know the rotor&#x27;s orientation relative to the stator coils. This is automatic in a brushed motor due to the fixed geometry of the rotor shaft and brushes. Some designs use Hall effect sensors or a rotary encoder to directly measure the rotor&#x27;s position. Others measure the back-EMF in the undriven coils to infer the rotor position, eliminating the need for separate Hall effect sensors. These are therefore often called &quot;sensorless&quot; controllers.

Controllers that sense rotor position based on back-EMF have extra challenges in initiating motion because no back-EMF is produced when the rotor is stationary. This is usually accomplished by beginning rotation from an arbitrary phase, and then skipping to the correct phase if it is found to be wrong. This can cause the motor to run backwards briefly, adding even more complexity to the startup sequence. Other sensorless controllers are capable of measuring winding saturation caused by the position of the magnets to infer the rotor position.

A typical controller contains three polarity-reversible outputs controlled by a logic circuit. Simple controllers employ comparators working from the orientation sensors to determine when the output phase should be advanced. More advanced controllers employ a microcontroller to manage acceleration, control motor speed and fine-tune efficiency.

Two key performance parameters of brushless DC motors are the motor constants formula_1 (torque constant) and formula_2 (back-EMF constant, also known as speed constant formula_3).

==Variations in construction==

Brushless motors can be constructed in several different physical configurations. In the conventional inrunner configuration, the permanent magnets are part of the rotor. Three stator windings surround the rotor. In the external-rotor outrunner configuration, the radial relationship between the coils and magnets is reversed; the stator coils form the center (core) of the motor, while the permanent magnets spin within an overhanging rotor that surrounds the core. Outrunners typically have more poles, set up in triplets to maintain the three groups of windings, and have a higher torque at low RPMs. In the flat axial flux type, used where there are space or shape constraints, stator and rotor plates are mounted face to face. In all brushless motors, the coils are stationary.

There are two common electrical winding configurations; the delta configuration connects three windings to each other in a triangle-like circuit, and power is applied at each of the connections. The wye (&quot;Y&quot;-shaped) configuration, sometimes called a star winding, connects all of the windings to a central point, and power is applied to the remaining end of each winding. A motor with windings in delta configuration gives low torque at low speed but can give higher top speed. Wye configuration gives high torque at low speed, but not as high top speed. The wye winding is normally more efficient. Delta-connected windings can allow high-frequency parasitic electrical currents to circulate entirely within the motor. A Wye-connected winding does not contain a closed loop in which parasitic currents can flow, preventing such losses. Aside from the higher impedance of the wye configuration, from a controller standpoint, the two winding configurations can be treated exactly the same.

== Applications ==

Brushless motors fulfill many functions originally performed by brushed DC motors, but cost and control complexity prevents brushless motors from replacing brushed motors completely in the lowest-cost areas. Nevertheless, brushless motors have come to dominate many applications, particularly devices such as computer hard drives and CD/DVD players. Small cooling fans in electronic equipment are powered exclusively by brushless motors. They can be found in cordless power tools where the increased efficiency of the motor leads to longer periods of use before the battery needs to be charged. Low speed, low power brushless motors are used in direct-drive turntables for gramophone records. Brushless motors can also be found in marine applications, such as underwater thrusters. Drones also utilize brushless motors to elevate their performance.

===Transport===
Brushless motors are found in electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, personal transporters, and electric aircraft. Most electric bicycles use brushless motors that are sometimes built into the wheel hub itself, with the stator fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel. The same principle is applied in self-balancing scooter wheels. Most electrically powered radio-controlled models use brushless motors because of their high efficiency.

===Cordless tools===
Brushless motors are found in many modern cordless tools, including some string trimmers, leaf blowers, saws (circular and reciprocating), and drills/drivers. The weight and efficiency advantages of brushless over brushed motors are more important to handheld, battery-powered tools than to large, stationary tools plugged into an AC outlet.

===Heating and ventilation===
There is a trend in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration industries to use brushless motors instead of various types of AC motors. The most significant reason to switch to a brushless motor is a reduction in power required to operate them versus a typical AC motor. In addition to the brushless motor&#x27;s higher efficiency, HVAC systems, especially those featuring variable-speed or load modulation, use brushless motors to give the built-in microprocessor continuous control over cooling and airflow.

===Industrial engineering===
The application of brushless DC motors within industrial engineering primarily focuses on manufacturing engineering or industrial automation design. Brushless motors are ideally suited for manufacturing applications because of their high power density, good speed-torque characteristics, high efficiency, wide speed ranges and low maintenance. The most common uses of brushless DC motors in industrial engineering are motion control, linear actuators, servomotors, actuators for industrial robots, extruder drive motors and feed drives for CNC machine tools.

Brushless motors are commonly used as pump, fan and spindle drives in adjustable or variable speed applications as they are capable of developing high torque with good speed response. In addition, they can be easily automated for remote control. Due to their construction, they have good thermal characteristics and high energy efficiency. To obtain a variable speed response, brushless motors operate in an electromechanical system that includes an electronic motor controller and a rotor position feedback sensor. Brushless DC motors are widely used as servomotors for machine tool servo drives. Servomotors are used for mechanical displacement, positioning or precision motion control. DC stepper motors can also be used as servomotors; however, since they are operated with open loop control, they typically exhibit torque pulsations.

Brushless motors are used in industrial positioning and actuation applications. For assembly robots, Brushless technology may be used to build linear motors. The advantage of linear motors is that they can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrews, leadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.

===Aeromodelling===
Brushless motors have become a popular motor choice for model aircraft including helicopters and drones. Their favorable power-to-weight ratios and wide range of available sizes have revolutionized the market for electric-powered model flight, displacing virtually all brushed electric motors, except for low powered inexpensive often toy grade aircraft. They have also encouraged growth of simple, lightweight electric model aircraft, rather than the previous internal combustion engines powering larger and heavier models. The increased power-to-weight ratio of modern batteries and brushless motors allows models to ascend vertically, rather than climb gradually. The low noise and lack of mass compared to small glow fuel internal combustion engines is another reason for their popularity.

Legal restrictions for the use of combustion engine driven model aircraft in some countries, most often due to potential for noise pollution—even with purpose-designed mufflers for almost all model engines being available over the most recent decades—have also supported the shift to high-power electric systems.

===Radio-controlled cars===
Their popularity has also risen in the radio-controlled (RC) car area. Brushless motors have been legal in North American RC car racing in accordance with Radio Operated Auto Racing (ROAR) since 2006. These motors provide a great amount of power to RC racers and, if paired with appropriate gearing and high-discharge lithium polymer (Li-Po) or lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, these cars can achieve speeds over .

Brushless motors are capable of producing more torque and have a faster peak rotational speed compared to nitro- or gasoline-powered engines. Nitro engines peak at around 46,800 r/min and , while a smaller brushless motor can reach 50,000 r/min and . Larger brushless RC motors can reach upwards of and 28,000 r/min to power one-fifth-scale models.

<text>Smithsonite, also known as zinc spar, is the mineral form of zinc carbonate (ZnCO3). Historically, smithsonite was identified with hemimorphite before it was realized that they were two different minerals. The two minerals are very similar in appearance and the term calamine has been used for both, leading to some confusion. The distinct mineral smithsonite was named in 1832 by François Sulpice Beudant in honor of English scientist James Smithson (c. 1765–1829), who first identified the mineral in 1802.

Smithsonite is a variably colored trigonal mineral which only rarely is found in well formed crystals. The typical habit is as earthy botryoidal masses. It has a Mohs hardness of 4.5 and a specific gravity of 4.4 to 4.5.

Smithsonite occurs as a secondary mineral in the weathering or oxidation zone of zinc-bearing ore deposits. It sometimes occurs as replacement bodies in carbonate rocks and as such may constitute zinc ore. It commonly occurs in association with hemimorphite, willemite, hydrozincite, cerussite, malachite, azurite, aurichalcite and anglesite. It forms two limited solid solution series, with substitution of manganese leading to rhodochrosite, and with iron, leading to siderite. A bright yellow variety is sometimes called &quot;turkey fat ore&quot;. The cause of the yellow colour is due to the presence of greenockite inclusions within the smithsonite crystals.

<text>Harald Rosenthal (born 9 June 1937) is a German hydrobiologist and fisheries scientist known for his work in fish farming, ecology, and international cooperation.

==Life==
Rosenthal was born and raised in Berlin. From 1957 to 1962, he studied zoology, botany, chemistry, geography, and philosophy at the &quot;Freie Universität Berlin&quot; (Free University of Berlin). From 1963 to 1968, he studied hydrobiology and fishery science in Hamburg.

He wrote his doctoral thesis in 1969 on mass rearing of larval herring and his habilitation thesis in 1981 on closed-circuit systems in fish farming and research. From 1989 to 2002, he was a professor at the &quot;Institut für Meereskunde&quot; (Institute for Marine Sciences) of Kiel University.

Rosenthal research focused on two areas:but
# &quot;Aquaculture&quot;: Here, he concentrated on applied research on the one hand, particularly on closed-circuit fish farms, and ecological aspects on the other, in particular control and prevention of pollution, and sustainability especially in developing countries.
# &quot;Ballast water&quot;: Rosenthal was one of the first to recognize and research the danger posed to ecosystems by the transport of marine life across huge distances in the ballast water of ships. He lobbied for regulations and other measures to combat this danger.

In addition to his own research, Rosenthal plays an important role in the international collaboration of hydrobiologists and aquaculturists, in particular between Canada and Germany as well as Israel and Germany.

Rosenthal is editor of the &quot;Journal of Applied Ichthyology&quot; and founder and president of the World Sturgeon Conservation Society (WSCS). He holds honorary doctorates of the universities of Edinburgh (1985), Moncton (1996), and Szczecin (2003) and is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<text>Jan Myrdal (19 July 1927 – 30 October 2020) was a Swedish author known for his strident Maoist, anti-imperialist and contrarian views and heterodox and highly subjective style of autobiography.

==Family==

Born in Bromma, Stockholm, in 1927, Jan Myrdal was the son of two of Sweden&#x27;s most influential 20th century intellectuals, Nobel Laureates Alva Myrdal (née Reimer) and Gunnar Myrdal, and the brother of Sissela Bok and Kaj Fölster. Through his sister Sissela, Myrdal was the brother-in-law of Dean of Harvard Law School and longtime president of Harvard University, Derek Bok.

Myrdal married four times. His first two wives, Maj Lidberg (1952–1956) and Nadja Wiking (1948–1952), bore him two children, Janken Myrdal (with Wiking) and Eva Myrdal (with Lidberg). Myrdal left both wives and their children at a young age, and, for most of his life, he would live with his third wife (1926–2007). A graphic artist and photographer, she illustrated many of his works. After Kessle&#x27;s death, Myrdal married Andrea Gaytán Vega in 2008. They divorced in 2018.

As a matter of public record and, indeed, as noted in Myrdal&#x27;s own writings, several family members severed ties with him after personal conflicts, due to his abandonment of their relationships, or in protest of his portrayals of the Myrdal family. His last book &quot;A Second Reprieve&quot; (2019), drew criticism for its graphic depiction of his own and his past wives&#x27; sexual and adulterous relationships, although it also garnered praise as a work of unflinching introspection.

An animal lover, Myrdal and Kessle (and later Myrdal, alone) owned a succession of cats and dogs, which feature in many of his books.

==Biography==

As a young child, Myrdal followed his parents to the United States shortly before the Second World War. After the German occupation of Norway in 1940, the family feared that a Nazi invasion of Sweden could be imminent and decided to return. Jan initially protested, perceiving himself at that time as a naturalized American; he would later stress the role that his childhood in New York had in shaping his intellectual evolution.

Relations between Myrdal and his parents were troubled, as he would later relate in several books. At sixteen, he dropped out of high school to focus on writing and politics. He initially had little success as a journalist and an author, which he attributed in part to his political views and to the influence of his parents, both of whom were leading figures within Sweden&#x27;s ruling Social Democratic party.

Having adopted Marxist-Leninist ideas already in the mid-1940s, Myrdal was for some years a member of Democratic Youth, the youth wing of Swedish Communist Party.

===&quot;The Big Life&quot;===

Starting in the late 1950s, Myrdal and his third wife, Kessle, embarked on a series of journeys in the Third World. Myrdal referred to his abandonment of settled life and family, and his henceforth complete dedication to intellectual and political pursuits, as &quot;the big life&quot; (&quot;det stora livet&quot;), characterizing it as a choice that came to define his life.

The couple lived for years in Afghanistan, Iran, and India. Myrdal began to focus his writings on anti-colonial politics and developed a politically-minded travel literature. An early example was his 1960 book &quot;Crossroads of Culture&quot;, later reissued as &quot;Travels in Afghanistan&quot;.

Since the mid-1950s, Myrdal had grown critical of the Soviet Union and he now gave voice to these misgivings, including works on the Soviet republics in Central Asia. As his heterodox Marxist-Leninist and anti-colonial ideas drew him to Maoist-style Communism, he became a stalwart defender of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Chinese government and, later, of the Cultural Revolution. His 1963 book &quot;Report from a Chinese Village&quot; achieved some international success when released in English in 1965, offering a then very rare socio-political study of life in rural China, albeit from a clear pro-Maoist perspective. Several of Myrdal&#x27;s works were subsequently banned in the Eastern Bloc. 

In the mid-1960s, Myrdal, who had returned to Sweden and settled with Kessle outside Mariefred, emerged as a major ideologue of Sweden&#x27;s youthful new left. He was also a prominent writer and organizer within the Swedish anti-Vietnam War movement. Still, he published on a wide range of subjects beyond anti-imperialist politics, establishing himself as a highly idiosyncratic voice on the far left of Swedish politics and culture.

A signature work was &quot;Confessions of a Disloyal European&quot;, published in original English in 1968 though in large part based on the merger of two previous Swedish books. It juxtaposes a deeply personal tragedy – a suicide that Myrdal failed to prevent – with what he views as the irresponsible political detachment of himself and other Western intellectuals (&quot;the whores of reason&quot;), as they fail to intervene against an impending Third World War produced by the contradictions of capitalism. In its mixing of personal and political themes and its fragmented structure, it presaged Myrdal&#x27;s later &quot;I novels&quot;. John Leonard of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as an &quot;extraordinary&quot; book and &quot;a particularly disturbing combination of fiction, reportage and allegory&quot;, while &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; offered a more mixed opinion of what was termed a &quot;curious document of social guilt&quot;.

In 1972, Myrdal co-founded &quot;Folket i Bild/Kulturfront&quot; (FiB/K), a political-cultural monthly &quot;for freedom of speech and of the press; for a people&#x27;s culture and anti-imperialism&quot;.. He remained involved with the magazine for much of his life, and continued to pen a regular column in it until 2019. FiB/K garnered major attention when it broke the IB affair in 1973, damaging the ruling Social Democratic Party by calling Swedish neutrality into question.

In line with his pro-Chinese, anti-Soviet politics, Myrdal supported Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia) against Vietnamese invasion in the 1970s, notwithstanding his long support for the Vietnamese struggle against the United States. Invited to Kampuchea as a guest of Pol Pot&#x27;s government, Myrdal wrote positively of the experience and said he had seen &quot;no horror stories&quot;. His defense of the Khmer Rouge and his dismissal of the reports of a genocide drew criticism in Sweden, and would remain a subject of controversy for the remainder of his life; he never recanted his pro-Khmer Rouge views.

In the early 1980s, Myrdal helped found a Swedish solidarity movement with the Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation. He had come to espouse the view that the Soviet Union had evolved into an even more menacing imperialist threat than the United States, urging Sweden to spend on national defense. He criticized post-Maoist China&#x27;s adoption of market economics under Deng Xiaoping, but continued to write appreciatively of Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania, for example in &quot;Albania Defiant&quot;.

===The I Novels===

In 1982, Myrdal&#x27;s literary career took a new turn with the publication of &quot;Childhood&quot;. A semi-autobiographical work somewhat in the mold of &quot;Confessions&quot;, it caused a scandal due to its unflattering depiction of his parents, Gunnar and Alva. Myrdal would continue to publish in the genre, which he labeled I novels (&quot;jagböcker&quot;), for the rest of his life, telling and retelling his life in fragmentary stories interwoven with political and historical material. Increasingly, the I novels dealt with themes of aging, memory, and death. The last in the series would be his final book, &quot;A Second Reprieve&quot; (2019).

Although the I novels cemented Myrdal&#x27;s position as a major figure in Swedish literature and intellectual life, his political influence waned from the late 1970s on. After the end of the Cold War, he grew increasingly marginalized after many of his former supporters renounced their previous support of Marxist-Leninist politics. In contrast to many other 1960s-era leftist intellectuals, Myrdal made no concessions to the new intellectual climate; rather, he doubled down on his views to the point where he began to be viewed as a politically toxic figure.

Nevertheless, as he turned 80 in 2007, Swedish National Television described him as &quot;one of the most significant [Swedish] authors of the 20th century&quot;, while noting that his political views had been &quot;strongly criticized&quot;.

===Later life===

In the early 2000s, Myrdal and Kessle moved from their longtime residence in Fagervik, near Mariefred, to Skinnskatteberg. A year after Kessle&#x27;s death in 2007, Myrdal remarried with Mexico-born Andrea Gaytán Vega, 34 years his junior. They split in 2011, then reconciled, and finally divorced in 2018. Myrdal lived for some time with Gaytán Vega in Fagersta, but spent most of his later life in Varberg.

In 1988, Myrdal had had to undergo open-heart surgery; the entire procedure was recorded and turned into an educational documentary shown on Swedish television and in schools. His health again deteriorated in the 2010s, when he was in his eighties. A near-death experience by sepsis is chronicled in &quot;A Second Reprieve&quot; (2019).

In 2008, admirers of Myrdal created , a literary society that sought to support his writing and stimulate research into his and Kessle&#x27;s work. Sponsored by Lasse Diding, a left-wing millionaire resident in Varberg, the Society helped move Myrdal himself and his 50,000-volume book collection to Varberg, where it established the Jan Myrdal Library, in which the author took up residence. However, the Society and Myrdal repeatedly clashed over various issues, political and financial. The Society also gives out the Lenin Award to a writer or filmmaker every year, which the first years also was called The Jan Myrdal Big Prize. 

In 2011 at the prize ceremony, Myrdal had this to say about our times: &quot;Right now, it smells again like Europe 1914. The summer/autumn of 1914 therefore gives us excellent examples of precisely cultural worker behaviour. It’s not that strange. The ruling thoughts are the thoughts of the rulers, and it is we who become pipes through which the wind of power blows.&quot;

Having ended his regular column in FiB/K in November 2019 at age 92, Myrdal was finally forced to cease writing due to ill health in 2020.

===Death===

Jan Myrdal died in Varberg on 30 October 2020, aged 93. Announcing his death, Jan Myrdal Society chairwoman Cecilia Cervin wrote: &quot;The person Jan Myrdal is dead. To wish peace upon his memory would be an expression of the bourgeois sentimentality that he loathed. So, instead: Read his works, visit and use his library, and, above all: continue the struggle in his spirit!&quot; The Chinese Embassy in Stockholm sent an official letter of condolences, describing Myrdal as &quot;an old friend of the Chinese people&quot;.

In accordance with Myrdal&#x27;s wishes, his body was donated to a university hospital for surgery practice.

== Legacy ==
The Jan Myrdal Society continues to operate the Jan Myrdal Library in Varberg, which is open to researchers. According to the Society, about a third of the volumes in the Library are held by no other Swedish library, testifying to Myrdal&#x27;s decades of book-collecting in Sweden and abroad, including during his Asian, African, and Latin American travels.

==Political views==
Myrdal was a life-long Marxist-Leninist, after breaking with the social democratic politics of his parents at an early age. He supported the politics of the Soviet-backed Swedish Communist Party in the 1940s and early 1950s, but later shifted to a pro-China, anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist brand of Communism, infused with strong, idiosyncratic views on Swedish culture and history. At times, he referred to himself as a Maoist or a Naxalite, although he generally shunned political labels and preferred to speak in terms of a leftist intellectual tradition.

After ending his involvement with the Moscow-backed Communist movement in the mid-1950s, Myrdal never again joined a political party, preferring to position himself as an independent thinker and writer. However, from 1968 to 1973 he headed the Swedish-Chinese Friendship Association. From 1971 to 1972 and again from 1987 to 1989, he was the publisher and chairman of the board of Folket i Bild/Kulturfront (FiB/K). In addition, he exerted influence of a more indirect nature as the intellectual lodestar of the KFML, a Maoist group that gained a very active student following in the late 1960s and 1970s. The KFML and its allies were the dominant faction within Sweden&#x27;s large and culturally influential pro-Vietnam movement, which protested the U.S. war in that country. These groups magnified Myrdal&#x27;s influence within the anti-war movement, when it was at its peak in terms of political and cultural influence. He later played a similar role in mobilizing a smaller but nonetheless energetic movement to oppose the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

Myrdal&#x27;s view of the Chinese Communist Party as a political model expired after Mao Zedong&#x27;s death, and Myrdal was highly critical of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s rule. In keeping with this dim view of China&#x27;s new leadership, he condemned the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and described the Beijing government as &quot;a military regime of the fascist type&quot;. In 1997, however, Myrdal publicly revised this opinion, saying he had come to the conclusion that although the protests had merit, the government crackdown had ultimately become necessary in order to prevent China from collapsing into internal conflict. Therefore, he said, &quot;[t]he question can not be whether it was moral or immoral to shed blood on the square of Heavenly Peace in the summer of 1989, but whether it was necessary or not in order to prevent a Bosnia in billion-size proportion and a possible Pacific war. If it was necessary, as I now believe, then it was right and moral. If it was not necessary, then it was wrong and criminal.&quot; This view met with little understanding in Sweden and would often be invoked by critics as evidence that Myrdal&#x27;s politics were beyond the pale. Myrdal subsequently softened his criticism of China, describing its global rise in positive terms as evidence of a global reordering.

Perhaps even more than the Tiananmen Square controversy, Myrdal&#x27;s position in Swedish public life suffered from his defense of Pol Pot&#x27;s regime in Democratic Kampuchea. Although he argued that national wars of liberation and peasant rebellions were intrinsically brutal affairs, in which many Cambodians had undoubtedly perished, he dismissed depictions of the regime&#x27;s purges as a genocide and continued to refer to senior Khmer Rouge leaders as friends and political allies until his death.

Despite his record of supporting totalitarian governments, Myrdal was fiercely opposed to limitations on free speech, citing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as superior to most other constitutional provisions existing in liberal democracies, and for also fostering a wider debate even against the backdrop of the Second Red Scare than was prevalent in Sweden (which itself had a legal, elected Communist Party) at the same time. He repeatedly argued in favor of civil liberties for everyone – including racists, Nazis, and Islamists. In his view, the left needed to protect and preserve &quot;bourgeois liberties&quot; acquired through past class struggles, and use whatever margin of freedom existed to pursue its cause.

In line with these positions, Myrdal was sharply critical of the Swedish constitution of 1974, which was introduced in order to modernize Sweden&#x27;s 19th-century constitution. To Myrdal, the new constitution did not symbolize modernity or a democratic step forward; rather, it was a dilution of the protections and division of power enshrined in past constitutional arrangements (see e.g. &quot;Skriftställning 6: Lag utan ordning&quot;, 1975).

Myrdal was generally of the opinion that movements that genuinely express aspirations for national self-determination or working class interests must be supported on their own terms, in their own cultural and political context. For example, despite being a lifelong atheist, Myrdal argued that Marxists could – indeed, should – make common cause with conservative religious movements whenever they expressed genuine popular or class aspirations. He sought points of convergence between Christian and leftist ideas in Sweden, urging FiB/K to make room for non-Communist and even conservative cultural views; internationally, he took a positive view of Islamist groups like Hezbollah or the Afghan Mujahedin. In 2006, Myrdal told Hezbollah&#x27;s al-Intiqad magazine: &quot;The question of international solidarity is in fact very simple. We formulated it during the war against US aggression in South East Asia: - Support the Liberation front on their own conditions!&quot;

After defending the right of anti-Semitic agitators and Holocaust deniers to be heard, including Ahmed Rami and Robert Faurisson, while also taking positions in favor of Palestinian attacks against Israelis and the government of Iran, Myrdal was dogged by allegations of anti-Semitism. He dismissed the criticism. Myrdal viewed Zionism as an imperialist phenomenon and Israel as a colonial settler-state, which should be dissolved and replaced by a binational Arab-Jewish state.

His defense of Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s theocratic government in Iran, which he compared favorably to the rule of the Shah, elicited some criticism. In 1989, Myrdal publicly distanced himself from Swedish intellectuals who condemned Khomeini&#x27;s death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy in &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Myrdal argued that although Rushdie should enjoy freedom of speech and belief, Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa was formally a correct expression of Islam in the Iranian context and the pro-Rushdie campaigns served anti-Muslim and imperialist interests.

In later years, Myrdal was criticized from the left for his lack of sensitivity to gender issues and homophobia. Sweden legalized homosexual adoption in 2003 and same-sex marriages in 2009. Myrdal was virtually alone among leftists in joining Christian conservatives to protest the new laws, arguing that legislators needed to respect social reality and children had a right to a legally recognized biological mother and father. However, he rejected accusations of homophobia, arguing that he had advocated for gay rights already in the 1940s and complaining that the allegation had become an &quot;online truth&quot;. Myrdal claimed that he had no objection to same-sex marriage, but objected to laws that could end up forcing Christian, Muslim, Jewish or other clergy to marry same-sex couples. &quot;To call this an objection to gay marriage is senseless&quot;, he said.

Having supported Afghan resistance to the Soviet Union in the 1980s, Myrdal was an equally enthusiastic supporter of Taliban resistance to US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan after 2001, including the a Swedish International Security Assistance Force contingent. In a 2009 FiB/K article titled &quot;Death to the Occupiers!&quot; he concluded that it equally correct to wish for the death of Swedish soldiers in Afghanistan in the 2000s as it had been to wish for the death of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan in the 1980s, or British colonial troops a hundred years earlier. To Myrdal, Afghans would not find peace unless &quot;ISAF soldiers, including the Swedish ones, are brought home in body bags and buried with military honors (and stirring speeches by cabinet ministers!)&quot;

Toward the end of his life, Myrdal warned that the organized left was losing its footing within the working class, and insisted that the political task of Marxists was to follow the working class and express its demands. He caused a stir among his own supporters by writing that the electoral successes of the far-right Front National in France was based on her ability to attract working class voters by attacking neoliberalism. Although the Front National leader Marine Le Pen &quot;is not a socialist&quot;, Myrdal wrote, &quot;she nevertheless expresses what is, in fact, class demands of the working class and the working people&quot;. In 2016, he demonstratively penned an article for the far-right newspaper &quot;Nya Tider&quot;, founded and run by former members of the National Democrats.

==Writing==

A voracious reader, a bibliophile, and an unusually prolific and eclectic writer, Myrdal published books and articles on a very broad range of topics, in addition to novels and plays. In Myrdal&#x27;s writing, the line dividing art, literature, and politics is generally fluid, if at all existent; he will often dive into far-ranging historical and cultural exposés, circling back hundreds of years to contextualize a contemporary issue or personal experience.

As an author, Myrdal was self-taught. Having dropped out of gymnasium to concentrate on his writing, he was briefly employed as a journalist at a local newspaper and struggled to find a publisher for early novel drafts. &quot;Report from a Chinese Village&quot; (1963) was not his first published book, but it became his breakthrough, including, to a lesser extent, on the international level. A semi-anthropological study, it offered a snapshot of life in a village in Mao&#x27;s China, which was then largely isolated and little understood even in left-wing circles. He would later publish similar reports and travel notes from Asian countries, including India, Afghanistan, and the then-Soviet Central Asia.

His 1968 book &quot;Confessions of a Disloyal European&quot; was chosen by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of that year&#x27;s &quot;ten books of particular significance and excellence&quot;. In 1982 Myrdal returned to the Chinese village he had reported on in 1962 and recorded his observations in &quot;Return to a Chinese Village&quot; (1984), in which he expressed his disappointment at the changes that had occurred and his continued support of Mao&#x27;s programs, including the Cultural Revolution.

Myrdal continued writing political and travel literature well into his 80s. In 2010, he traveled to India to join Naxalite-Maoist rebels in their jungle camps, which led to the book &quot;Red Star over India&quot; (2012).

However, Myrdal was not solely a nonfiction writer or a polemicist. His interests strayed far beyond contemporary politics, and, over the decades, he published on such diverse topics as 19th Century French caricature, Afghanistan, Balzac, wartime propaganda posters, wine, Meccano, sex, death, and Strindberg. Indeed, Strindberg&#x27;s intellectual eclecticism, ceaseless feuding, and strident politics appears to have served as a model for Myrdal&#x27;s own literary and public persona.

Myrdal&#x27;s best-known works include the semi-autobiographical I novels. These deal mainly with his childhood and his complex, conflicted relationship with his parents, Alva Myrdal and Gunnar Myrdal. The full suite of autobiographical material is non-chronological and contains numerous repetitions and reformulations. According to Anton Honkonen, the assembled autobiographical material comprises a total of fifteen volumes and more than 3,250 pages, spread over 57 years of publishing.

Through the publication of &quot;Childhood&quot; (in Swedish as &quot;Barndom&quot;, 1982), Myrdal&#x27;s &quot;I Novels&quot; became strongly associated with the controversy surrounding his tense relationship to his famous parents. Myrdal&#x27;s unflattering portraits of his parents – even as he acknowledged their importance as intellectuals – caused a scandal at the time of &quot;Childhood&quot;&#x27;s publication. Later &quot;I books&quot; moved away from the childhood theme to focus on Myrdal&#x27;s experiences of old age, but would nevertheless regularly rehash and comment on early life experiences, never quite relinquishing the child&#x27;s perspective.

Myrdal&#x27;s final book, &quot;Ett andra anstånd&quot; (&quot;A Second Reprieve&quot;, 2019) is a prime example of the later I novels. Although it dwells on his childhood years and on the conflicts with Alva and Gunnar, the central focus is on aging and death, loneliness, past loves, and sex. Throughout the book, Myrdal revisits his own past tellings of life events, revising narratives and correcting his own assertions from earlier books and even earlier chapters in the &quot;A Second Reprive&quot;. Exhuming unflattering aspects of his life that he had previously suppressed or distorted, he graphically recounts contracting venereal disease, cheating on a wife, and being cheated on.

One of the central I novels, &quot;Maj. En kärlek&quot; (1998), which deals with Myrdal&#x27;s second marriage, was republished with newly added material in 2020.

Since the 1960s, Myrdal&#x27;s newspaper and magazine columns were collected in numbered volumes labeled &quot;Skriftställningar&quot;, meaning, roughly, &quot;writings&quot;. The word recalls Myrdal&#x27;s own favored title, the archaically styled &quot;skriftställare&quot;, rather than the more modern &quot;författare&quot;, author. Myrdal described the series as an irregular one-man periodical. The last volume in the series was &quot;Skriftställning 21: På tvärs&quot; (2013).
