<text>Aníbal Carmelo Troilo (11 July 1914 – 18 May 1975), also known as Pichuco, was an Argentine tango musician.

Troilo was a bandoneon player, composer, arranger, and bandleader in Argentina. His orquesta típica was among the most popular with social dancers during the golden age of tango (1940–1955), but he changed to a concert sound by the late 1950s.

Troilo&#x27;s orchestra is best known for its instrumentals, though he also recorded with many well-known vocalists such as Roberto Goyeneche, Edmundo Rivero and . His rhythmic instrumentals and the recordings he made with vocalist Francisco Fiorentino from 1941 to 1943, known as milongas, were some of the favourites in tango salons. The renowned bandoneonist Astor Piazzolla played in and arranged for Troilo&#x27;s orquesta típica during the period of 1939–1944.

==Biography==
Aníbal Troilo was born on 11 July 1914, to Felisa Bagnoli and Aníbal Troilo, in the well-known barrio of Abasto.
His father nicknamed him &quot;Pichuco&quot;, an alteration of the Neapolitan &quot;picciuso&quot;, meaning &quot;weepy&quot;, or &quot;crybaby&quot;. He had one brother and one sister.
During his childhood, Troilo listened to the bandoneon in the bars of his neighbourhood. At the age of 10, he convinced his mother to buy him his first bandoneon. Troilo kept the instrument and played it for the rest of his life.

When he was 11, in 1925, Pichuco played his first performance in a bar. At the age of 14, he formed his first quintet.
He studied until his third year of high school at Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, one of the most prestigious high schools in Argentina and the whole of Latin America.

In December 1930, Troilo was hired to be part of the famous Vardaro-Pugliese sextet of violinist Elvino Vardaro, pianist Osvaldo Pugliese, violinist Alfredo Gobbi, bandoneon player Miguel Jurado (later replaced by Ciriaco Ortiz), and double bass player Luis Addesso.
Following this, Troilo played in numerous orchestras, including those of Juan &quot;Pacho&quot; Maglio, Julio de Caro, Juan d&#x27;Arienzo, Angel D&#x27;Agostino, and Juan Carlos Cobián.

With his own orchestra, (whose members varied greatly), he played almost continuously, both live and in the studio, until 1975, the year of his death. From 1953 until the mid-60s, Troilo also played with guitarist Roberto Grela as a duo, which later became the Troilo-Grela Quartet. In 1968, having distanced himself from Grela, he formed his own ensemble, the Aníbal Troilo Quartet, which additionally consisted of Ubaldo de Lío on electric guitar, Osvaldo Berlingieri on piano, and Rafael del Bagno on double bass. Berlingieri was later replaced by José Colángelo, who also played in the Aníbal Troilo Orchestra during its final years. In addition to this, Troilo recorded two songs (&quot;El motivo&quot; and &quot;Volver&quot;) as a bandoneon duo with Astor Piazzolla.
The death of Troilo&#x27;s best friend, the poet Homero Manzi (1907–1951), caused him to go into a deep depression that lasted for more than a year. In the poet&#x27;s memory, he composed the tango &quot;Responso&quot;.

The &quot;Supreme Bandoneón of Buenos Aires&quot; died on 18 May 1975, at the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires, from a stroke and subsequent cardiac arrest; he is buried in the &quot;Rincón de los Notables&quot; (Famous corner) of the La Chacarita cemetery, next to Agustín Magaldi and Roberto Goyeneche.

==Bandoneón Day==

In 2005, the National Congress of Argentina declared 11 July (Troilo&#x27;s birthday) National Bandoneón Day, to commemorate one of the nation&#x27;s most celebrated musicians.

<doc id="715178" wikidata="Q46953" url="?curid=715178" title="Perpetual virginity of Mary">
<text>The perpetual virginity of Mary is a Christian doctrine that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a virgin &quot;before, during and after&quot; the birth of Christ. In Western Christianity, the Catholic Church adheres to the doctrine, as do some Lutherans, Anglicans, Reformed, and other Protestants. In Eastern Christianity, the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Church of the East both adhere to this doctrine as part of their ongoing tradition, and Eastern Orthodox churches recognize Mary as Aeiparthenos, meaning &quot;ever-virgin&quot;. It is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church. Most modern nonconformist Protestants reject the doctrine.

The extant written tradition of the perpetual virginity of Mary first appears in a late 2nd-century text called the Protoevangelium of James. The Second Council of Constantinople in 553 gave her the title &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot;, meaning Perpetual Virgin, and at the Lateran Synod of 649 Pope Martin I emphasized the threefold character of the perpetual virginity, before, during, and after the birth of Christ. The Lutheran Smalcald Articles (1537) and the Reformed Second Helvetic Confession (1562) codified the doctrine of perpetual virginity of Mary as well.

The doctrine of Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity has been challenged on the basis that the New Testament explicitly affirms her virginity only until the birth of Jesus and mentions the brothers (&quot;adelphoi&quot;) of Jesus, who may have been: (1) sons of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Joseph; (2) sons of Joseph by a former marriage; or (3) sons of the Mary named in Mark 15:40 as &quot;mother of James and Joses&quot;, who has been identified as either the wife of Clopas and sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus, or a sister-in-law to Joseph. 

== Origin and history ==

=== Virginitas in partu: 1st century ===
The Odes of Solomon have been interpreted as implying that Mary was a virgin even during childbirth as well as stating that Mary did not have pain during childbirth. Similar statements exist in the Ascension of Isaiah. 

=== 2nd century ===
The virgin birth of Jesus is found in the Gospel of Matthew and possibly in Luke, but it seems to have little theological importance before the middle of the 2nd century. The 2nd century Church fathers Irenaeus and Justin Martyr, though mentioning the virgin birth, nowhere affirmed explicitly the view that Mary was a perpetual virgin. This idea, however, appears in at least three second-century works: the Protoevangelium of James, the Gospel of Peter and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. All of these early sources independently assert that the so-called &quot;brothers of the Lord&quot; were children of Joseph&#x27;s first marriage. According to Protestant scholar Richard Bauckham, these works &quot;show no signs of literary relationship&quot; and probably &quot;evidence of a well-established tradition in (probably early) second-century Syrian Christianity that Jesus&#x27; brothers and sisters were children of Joseph by a previous marriage&quot;. According to Richard Bauckham, Ignatius of Antioch also believed in the doctrine of Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;in partu&quot;.

The Gospel of James states that Mary remained a life-long virgin, because Joseph was an old man who married her without physical desire, and the brothers of Jesus mentioned in the canonical gospels are explained as Joseph&#x27;s sons by an earlier marriage. The Protoevangelium seems to have been used to create the stories of Mary which are found in the Quran, but while Muslims agree with Christians that Mary was a virgin at the moment of the conception of Jesus, the idea of her perpetual virginity thereafter is contrary to the Islamic ideal of women as wives and mothers. The Second Apocalypse of James portrays James, the Brother of the Lord, not as a child of Joseph but of a certain &quot;Theudas&quot;, a relative of Jesus.

Hegesippus&#x27;s writings are not clear on this subject, with some authors arguing that he defended the doctrine, while others arguing that he disputed the perpetual virginity of Mary.

The Ebionites denied the virgin birth and Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity.

=== Early uncertainty: 3rd century ===

In the 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome held that Mary was &quot;ever-virgin&quot;, while Clement of Alexandria, writing soon after the Protoevangelium appeared, appealed to its incident of a midwife who examined Mary immediately after the birth (&quot;after giving birth, she was examined by a midwife, who found her to be a virgin&quot;) and asserted that this was to be found in the Gospels (&quot;These things are attested to by the Scriptures of the Lord&quot;), though he was referring to an apocryphal Gospel as a fact. The 3rd century scholar Origen used the Protoevangelium&#x27;s explanation of the brothers to uphold the perpetual virginity of Mary (&quot;There is no child of Mary except Jesus, according to those who think correctly about her&quot;). Origen also mentioned that the gospel of Peter affirmed the perpetual virginity of Mary, saying that the &quot;brothers&quot; of Jesus were from a previous marriage of Joseph.

Tertullian, who came between Clement and Origen, denied Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;in partu&quot; to refute the docetist idea that the Son of God could not have assumed a human body (&quot;although she was a virgin when she conceived, she was a wife when she brought forth her son&quot;). Tertullian, however, is not entirely clear on the issue of Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;post partum&quot;, with some scholars denying his traditional association with the Helvidian position.

Helvidius also argued that Victorinus believed that Mary had other children; Jerome later claimed that Helvidius was misinterpreting Victorinus. Epiphanius invented a name &quot;Antidicomarians&quot; for a group of people who denied the perpetual virginity of Mary, which Epiphanius attacked. Their same views were also mentioned earlier by Origen, although he too rejected them as heretical. They were active from the 3rd to the 5th century.

According to Epiphanius the Antidicomarians claimed that Apollinaris of Laodicea or his disciples denied the perpetual virginity of Mary, though Epiphanius doubted the claim.

Early Christian theologians such as Hippolytus (170–235), Eusebius (260/265–339/340) and Epiphanius (c. 310/320–403) defended the perpetual virginity of Mary.

=== Establishment of orthodoxy: 4th century ===
By the early 4th century the spread of monasticism had promoted celibacy as the ideal state, and a moral hierarchy was established with marriage occupying the third rank below life-long virginity and widowhood. Eastern theologians generally accepted Mary as &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot;, but many in the Western church were less convinced. The theologian Helvidius objected to the devaluation of marriage inherent in this view and argued that the two states, of virginity and marriage, were equal. His contemporary Jerome, realising that this would lead to the Mother of God occupying a lower place in heaven than virgins and widows, defended her perpetual virginity in his immensely influential &quot;Against Helvidius&quot;, issued c.383.

In the 380s and 390s the monk Jovinian denied Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;in partu&quot; (virgin during childbirth), writing that if Jesus did not undergo a normal human birth, then his body was something other than a truly human one. As reported by Augustine, Jovinian &quot;denied that the virginity of Mary, which existed when she conceived, remained while she gave birth.&quot; Augustine goes on to say that the reason for Jovinian&#x27;s denial of Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;in partu&quot; was that the doctrine was too close to the Manichean view that Christ was simply a phantom. According to Ambrose, Jovinian maintained that Mary had conceived as a virgin, but she had not given birth as a virgin. Jerome wrote against Jovinian but failed to mention this aspect of his teaching, and most commentators believe that he did not find it offensive. Jovinian also found two monks in Milan, Sarmatio and Barbatian, who held similar views as Jovinian.

The only important Christian intellectual to defend Mary&#x27;s virginity &quot;in partu&quot; was Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, who was the chief target of the charge of Manicheism. In 391, he wrote &quot;Concerning Virginity&quot; whose full title was &quot;On the Education of the Virgin and the Perpetual Virginity of Mary&quot;. For Ambrose, both the physical birth of Jesus by Mary and the baptismal birthing of Christians by the church had to be totally virginal, even &quot;in partu&quot;, in order to cancel the stain of original sin, of which the pains of labor are the physical sign. It was due to Ambrose that &quot;virginitas in partu&quot; came to be included consistently in the thinking of subsequent theologians. Bonosus of Sardica also denied the perpetual virginity of Mary, for which he was declared a heretic. His followers would survive for many centuries, especially among the Goths. Additionally, the perpetual virginity of Mary was denied by some Arians.

Jovinian was condemned as a heretic at a Synod of Milan under Ambrose&#x27;s presidency in 390 and Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity was established as the only orthodox view. Further developments were to follow when the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 formally gave her the title &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot;, and at the Lateran Synod of 649 Pope Martin I emphasised the threefold character of the perpetual virginity, before, during, and after the birth of Christ.

Athanasius of Alexandria (d.393) declared Mary &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot;, &quot;ever-virgin&quot;, and the liturgy of James the brother of Jesus likewise required a declaration of Mary as ever-virgin. This view was defended by Augustine, Hilary of Poitiers, Didymus the Blind, Cyril of Alexandria among others.

The Apostles&#x27; Creed taught the doctrine of &quot;virginitas in partu&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages the perpetual virginity of Mary was commonly accepted, however the Paulicians denied her perpetual virginity, even saying that Christ denied her to be blessed.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
The Protestant Reformation saw a rejection of the special moral status of lifelong celibacy. As a result, marriage and parenthood were extolled, and Mary and Joseph were seen as a normal married couple. It also affirmed the Bible alone as the fundamental source of authority regarding God&#x27;s word (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;). The reformers noted that while scripture records the virgin birth, it makes no mention of Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity following the birth of Christ. Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity was upheld by Martin Luther (who names her ever-virgin in the Smalcald Articles, a Lutheran confession of faith written in 1537), Huldrych Zwingli, Thomas Cranmer, Wollebius, Bullinger, John Wycliffe and later Protestant leaders including John Wesley, the co-founder of Methodism. Osiander denied the perpetual virginity of Mary, for which Melanchthon was scornful.

John Calvin&#x27;s view was more ambiguous, believing that knowing what happened to Mary after the birth of Jesus is impossible. However John Calvin argued that &quot;Matthew 1:25&quot;, used by Helvidius to attack the perpetual virginity of Mary does not teach that Mary had other children. Other Calvinists affirmed Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity, including within the Second Helvetic Confession—stating that Mary was the &quot;ever virgin Mary&quot;—and in the notes of the Geneva Bible. Theodore Beza, a prominent early Calvinist, included the perpetual virginity of Mary in a list of agreements between Calvinism and the Catholic Church. Some reformers upheld the doctrine to counter more radical reformers who questioned the divinity of Christ; Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity guaranteed the Incarnation of Christ despite the challenges to its scriptural foundations. Modern Protestants have largely rejected the perpetual virginity of Mary on the basis of &quot;sola scriptura,&quot; and it has rarely appeared explicitly in confessions or doctrinal statements, though the perpetual virginity of Mary is still a common belief in Anglicanism and Lutheranism.

Among the Anabaptists, Hubmaier never abandoned his belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary and continued to esteem Mary as theotokos (&quot;mother of God&quot;). These two doctrinal stances are addressed individually in Articles Nine and Ten, respectively, of Hubmaier&#x27;s work, &quot;Apologia&quot;.

==Doctrine==

The Second Council of Constantinople recognized Mary as &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot;, meaning &quot;ever-virgin&quot;. It remains axiomatic for the Eastern Orthodox Church that she remained virginal throughout her Earthly life, and Orthodoxy therefore understands the New Testament references to the brothers and sisters of Jesus as signifying his kin, but not the biological children of his mother.

The Latin Church, known more commonly today as the Catholic Church, shared the Council of Constantinople with the theologians of the Greek or Orthodox communion, and therefore shares with them the title &quot;Aeiparthenos&quot; as accorded to Mary. The Catholic Church has gone further than the Orthodox in making the Perpetual Virginity one of the four Marian dogmas, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is heresy. It declares her virginity before, during and after the birth of Jesus, or in the definition formulated by Pope Martin I at the Lateran Council of 649:The blessed ever-virginal and immaculate Mary conceived, without seed, by the Holy Spirit, and without loss of integrity brought him forth, and after his birth preserved her virginity inviolate.

Thomas Aquinas admitted that reason could not prove this, but argued that it must be accepted because it was &quot;fitting&quot;, for as Jesus was the only-begotten son of God, so he should also be the only-begotten son of Mary, as a second and purely human conception would disrespect the sacred state of her holy womb. Symbolically, the perpetual virginity of Mary signifies a new creation and a fresh start in salvation history. It has been stated and argued repeatedly, most recently by the Second Vatican Council:

== Arguments and evidence ==
A problem facing theologians wishing to maintain Mary&#x27;s life-long virginity is that the Pauline epistles, the four gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles all mention the brothers (&quot;adelphoi&quot;) of Jesus; both Matthew and Mark record their names and add unnamed sisters. The &quot;Gospel of James&quot;, followed a century later by Epiphanius, explained the &quot;adelphoi&quot; as Joseph&#x27;s children by an earlier marriage, which is still the view of the Eastern Orthodox Christian churches. Jerome, believing that Joseph, like Mary, must be a life-long virgin, argued that these &quot;adelphoi&quot; were the sons of &quot;Mary, the mother of James and Joses&quot; (Mark 15:40), who he identified with the wife of Clopas and sister of the virgin Mary (John 19:25), which remains popular in the Western church. A modern proposal considers these &quot;adelphoi&quot; sons of &quot;Mary, the mother of James and Joses&quot; (not here identified with the Virgin Mary&#x27;s sister), and Clopas, who according to Hegesippus was Joseph&#x27;s brother.

Further scriptural difficulties were added by Luke 2:7, which calls Jesus the &quot;first-born&quot; son of Mary, and Matthew 1:25, which adds that Joseph &quot;did not know her until she had brought forth her firstborn son.&quot;

Helvidius argued that first-born implies later births, and that the word &quot;until&quot; left open the way to sexual relations after the birth; Jerome, replying that even an only son will be a first-born and that &quot;until&quot; did not have the meaning Helvidius construed for it, painted a repulsive word-portrait of Joseph having intercourse with a blood-stained and exhausted Mary immediately after she has given birth—the implication, in his view, of Helvidius&#x27;s arguments. Opinions on the quality of Jerome&#x27;s rebuttal range from the view that it was masterful and well-argued to thin, rhetorical and sometimes tasteless. Further, to say that something did not occur &quot;until&quot; specific event does not conclusively establish what, if anything, occurred thereafter.

Two other 4th century Fathers, Gregory of Nyssa, following &quot;a certain apocryphal account&quot;, and Augustine, advanced a further argument by reading Luke 1:34 as a vow of perpetual virginity on Mary&#x27;s part; this idea, first introduced in the Protoevangelium of James, has little scholarly support today, but it and the arguments advanced by Jerome and Ambrose were put forward by Pope John Paul II in his catechesis of August 28, 1996, as the four facts supporting the Catholic Church&#x27;s ongoing faith in Mary&#x27;s perpetual virginity.

It has been argued from John 19, where Jesus entrusts Mary to the disciple John instead of his brothers, to support the view that Jesus had no brothers, however Protestants have generally argued in two ways against this passage, one by claiming that the brothers of Jesus were unbelievers or that they were not present during the crucifixion.

Some have argued that Mary and Joseph could not have had a normal marriage if Mary remained a perpetual virgin; however, it has been argued by some Catholics that there is evidence that celibacy within marriage was already practiced by the Qumran community and other Jews at that time.

Catholic priest and New Testament scholar John P. Meier argues that although the preponderance of scriptural evidence indicates that Jesus had siblings, the evidence is not conclusive enough to disprove the perpetual virginity of Mary.

<text>Roshnai Gate () is one of the thirteen gates within the Walled City of Lahore in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It was the main entry into Lahore for emperors and nobles during the Mughal, and later Sikh period.

Its extended height and width is testament to its use by emperors&#x27; caravans of elephants. Since the Ravi river once flowed alongside the northern wall of the Lahore Fort and the Badshahi Mosque, the gate was profusely illuminated during night to aid travelers. It is for this reason that the gate has been named as “Roshnai Darwaza” or the “gate of light”. It is considered to be the oldest of Lahore&#x27;s gates, and is only gate that has been preserved in its original shape.

<doc id="715186" wikidata="Q3229327" url="?curid=715186" title="Piling-up lemma">
<text>In cryptanalysis, the piling-up lemma is a principle used in linear cryptanalysis to construct linear approximations to the action of block ciphers. It was introduced by Mitsuru Matsui (1993) as an analytical tool for linear cryptanalysis. The lemma states that the bias (deviation of the expected value from 1/2) of a linear Boolean function (XOR-clause) of independent binary random variables is related to the product of the input biases:

:formula_1

or

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the bias (towards zero) and formula_4 the &quot;imbalance&quot;:

:formula_5
:formula_6.
Conversely, if the lemma does not hold, then the input variables are not independent.

== Interpretation ==
The lemma implies that XOR-ing independent binary variables always reduces the bias (or at least does not increase it); moreover, the output is unbiased if and only if there is at least one unbiased input variable.

Note that for two variables the quantity formula_7 is a correlation measure of formula_8 and formula_9, equal to formula_10; formula_11 can be interpreted as the correlation of formula_8 with formula_13.

== Expected value formulation ==
The piling-up lemma can be expressed more naturally when the random variables take values in formula_14. If we introduce variables formula_15 (mapping 0 to 1 and 1 to -1) then, by inspection, the XOR-operation transforms to a product:

:formula_16

and since the expected values are the imbalances, formula_17, the lemma now states:

:formula_18

which is a known property of the expected value for independent variables.

For dependent variables the above formulation gains a (positive or negative) covariance term, thus the lemma does not hold. In fact, since two Bernoulli variables are independent if and only if they are uncorrelated (i.e. have zero covariance; see uncorrelatedness), we have the converse of the piling up lemma: if it does not hold, the variables are not independent (uncorrelated).

==Boolean derivation==
The piling-up lemma allows the cryptanalyst to determine the probability that the equality:

:formula_19

holds, where the &quot;X&quot;″s are binary variables (that is, bits: either 0 or 1).

Let &quot;P&quot;(A) denote &quot;the probability that A is true&quot;. If it equals one, A is certain to happen, and if it equals zero, A cannot happen. First of all, we consider the piling-up lemma for two binary variables, where formula_20 and formula_21.

Now, we consider:

:formula_22

Due to the properties of the xor operation, this is equivalent to

:formula_23

&quot;X&quot;1 = &quot;X&quot;2 = 0 and &quot;X&quot;1 = &quot;X&quot;2 = 1 are mutually exclusive events, so we can say

:formula_24

Now, we must make the central assumption of the piling-up lemma: the binary variables we are dealing with are independent; that is, the state of one has no effect on the state of any of the others. Thus we can expand the probability function as follows:

Now we express the probabilities &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 as + ε1 and + ε2, where the ε&#x27;s are the probability biases — the amount the probability deviates from .

Thus the probability bias ε1,2 for the XOR sum above is 2ε1ε2.

This formula can be extended to more &quot;X&quot;″s as follows:

:formula_25

Note that if any of the ε&#x27;s is zero; that is, one of the binary variables is unbiased, the entire probability function will be unbiased — equal to .

A related slightly different definition of the bias is
formula_26 
in fact minus two times the previous value. The advantage is that now with

:formula_27

we have

:formula_28
adding random variables amounts to multiplying their (2nd definition) biases.

==Practice==
In practice, the &quot;X&quot;s are approximations to the S-boxes (substitution components) of block ciphers. Typically, &quot;X&quot; values are inputs to the S-box and &quot;Y&quot; values are the corresponding outputs. By simply looking at the S-boxes, the cryptanalyst can tell what the probability biases are. The trick is to find combinations of input and output values that have probabilities of zero or one. The closer the approximation is to zero or one, the more helpful the approximation is in linear cryptanalysis.

However, in practice, the binary variables are not independent, as is assumed in the derivation of the piling-up lemma. This consideration has to be kept in mind when applying the lemma; it is not an automatic cryptanalysis formula.

<doc id="715193" wikidata="Q294404" url="?curid=715193" title="Henry Ian Cusick">
<text>Henry Ian Cusick (born 17 April 1967) is a Peruvian-Scottish actor of television, film, and theatre and a television director.

He is best known for his role as Desmond Hume in the ABC television series &quot;Lost&quot;, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also starred as Jesus in &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;, as Stephen Finch in the ABC political thriller series &quot;Scandal&quot;, as Marcus Kane in The CW science fiction series &quot;The 100&quot;, as Dr. Jonas Lear in &quot;The Passage&quot; on Fox, and as Russell &quot;Russ&quot; Taylor in the CBS action drama &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

==Early life==
Cusick was born in Trujillo, Peru, to a Peruvian mother, Esperanza Chávez, and a Scottish father, Henry Joseph Cusick. When he was two, his family moved to Madrid, Spain, before moving to Trinidad and Tobago, where they lived for ten years. There Cusick attended Presentation College, San Fernando. He moved to Newton Mearns, a town just outside of Glasgow in Scotland, with his family at the age of fourteen. Cusick attended the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and was asked to resign in his second year there due to attendance issues. He got his first acting role at the Citizens&#x27; Theatre as an understudy in the Christmas Panto playing a polar bear. He appeared in various productions for the Strathclyde Theatre Group in Glasgow. He is fluent in both English and Spanish, and was raised Roman Catholic.

==Career==
Cusick began his career as a classical theatre actor. His first leading roles onstage included Dorian Gray in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; with Rupert Everett, Hamlet in &quot;The Marovitz Hamlet&quot;, and Horner in &quot;The Country Wife&quot;. His 1994 performances as Torquato Tasso in the Edinburgh International Festival production of &quot;Torquato Tasso&quot;, and Creon in the Citizens&#x27; Theatre production of &quot;Oedipus&quot;, earned him a commendation at the 1995 Ian Charleson Awards for outstanding performance by a young actor in a classical theatre role.

On screen, after appearing in recurring roles in television series such as &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;The Book Group&quot;, he starred as Jesus Christ in the 2003 film &quot;The Visual Bible: The Gospel of John&quot;. His largest role to date came in 2005 when he was cast as Desmond Hume in the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot;. Originally a recurring guest star in the second season (for which he received an Emmy nomination), Cusick became a member of the main cast from seasons three to six. Cusick won the role when, while staying at the home of his friend Brian Cox, he met Cox&#x27;s next-door neighbor, Carlton Cuse, the executive producer of &quot;Lost&quot;. Cusick stated he believes &quot;a seed (was) planted, because they had been looking for either a Scottish or Irish character.&quot;

He also appeared as Theo Stoller in two episodes of season 5 of &quot;24&quot; and the 2007 film &quot;Hitman&quot;. He stars in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Dead Like Me: Life After Death&quot;, a continuation of the cult classic television show of the same name.

Cusick appeared in two episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in the twelfth season, playing Erik Weber, a vigilante with a Citizens Organized Against Predators group. He was in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Scandal&quot; in 2011, but left the following year.

He also played Trent Marsh in &quot;Body of Proof&quot; and portrayed Marcus Kane until his character switched bodies with another actor in &quot;The 100&quot;, which premiered in March 2014.

Cusick also directed a short film called &quot;Dress&quot;, filmed in his home town, Kailua, Hawaii, winning the best short at HIFF and Peace on Earth Film Festival.

In 2017, Cusick partnered with tech start-up JamBios to promote its reminiscing and memory-sharing social platform. He plays the voice of Monty, the digital biographer, and recorded over 200 questions that Monty asks users to help spur their memories. Cusick&#x27;s wife Annie is the curator of the JamBios Memory Gallery.

==Personal life==
Cusick and his wife Annie Cusick Wood are parents to three sons; Eli (b. 1994), Lucas (b. 1998), and Esau (b. 2000).

<doc id="715200" wikidata="Q5255880" url="?curid=715200" title="Democratic globalization">
<text>Democratic globalization is a social movement towards an institutional system of global democracy. One of its proponents is the British political thinker David Held. In the last decade, Held published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encompasses the entire world. For some, democratic mundialisation (from the French term mondialisation) is a variant of democratic globalisation that emphasizes the need for citizens worldwide to directly elect world leaders and members of global institutions; for others, it is just democratic globalization by another name.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation&#x27;s purpose is to:
* Expand globalisation and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and &quot;make people closer, more united and protected&quot; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens.
* Give world citizens democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for United Nations Secretary-General by citizens and direct election of members of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly.

Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens via their participation in world democratic institutions. Some proponents in the anti-globalization movement do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term global justice movement), has proposed in his work &quot;Age of Consent&quot; similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies and a form of world government.

== Background ==

Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and financial globalization. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and central bank must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for autocratic regimes. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==

The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, World Bank, World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Monetary Fund. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and civil disobedience.

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens. The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===

Thus, it supports the International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, that would allow for participation of member nations&#x27; legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Differences with anti-globalization==

Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see presidentialism).

Some supporters of the &quot;anti-globalization movement&quot; do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement) in his work &quot;Age of Consent&quot; has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of &quot;federal world government&quot;.

==Procedure==

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens. The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world civil protection and prevention (from natural hazards) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the British political thinker David Held and the Italian political theorist Daniele Archibugi. In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire planet. Richard Falk has developed the idea from an international law perspective, Ulrich Beck from a sociological approach and Jürgen Habermas has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
* In 2003, Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: &quot;I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of &#x27;one person, one vote, one value&#x27;; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world&#x27;s people equally to decide on matters of international significance.&quot;
* Graham Watson (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe) and Jo Leinen (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the &quot;Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy&quot; on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.

===List of prominent figures===
* Garry Davis (peace activist who created the first World Passport)
* Albert Einstein (&quot;The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people&quot;)
* George Monbiot (&quot;A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves&quot;)
* Desmond Tutu (&quot;We must strive for a global democracy, in which not only the rich and the powerful have a say, but which treats everyone, everywhere with dignity and respect&quot;)
* Peter Ustinov (President of the World Federalist Movement from 1991 to 2004)
* Abhay K (&quot;The mass availability of internet-connected mobile phones paves the way for planetary consciousness and global democracy&quot;)

<text>Sleepaway Camp is a 1983 American slasher film written and directed by Robert Hiltzik, and starring Mike Kellin (in his last on-screen appearance), Katherine Kamhi, and Paul DeAngelo alongside Jonathan Tiersten, Felissa Rose, Christopher Collet (in his film debut), and Karen Fields. The original entry in the &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; film series, it focuses on serial killings which occur at a summer camp for teenagers.

Filmed in upstate New York in the fall of 1982, &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; was released the following year by United Film Distributors. It earned approximately $11 million at the box office, but was met by largely unfavorable reviews from critics, many of whom deemed it exploitative and derivative of such films as &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980).

In the years since its release, &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; has gone on to develop a cult following, as well as garnering notoriety for its twist ending, which is considered one of the most shocking in the horror genre and in film history at large.

It was followed by four sequels: &quot;Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers&quot; (1988), &quot;Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland&quot; (1989), &quot;Return to Sleepaway Camp&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor&quot; (2012).

==Plot==
In 1975, John Baker and his boyfriend, Lenny, take John&#x27;s children Angela and Peter on a boating trip. After the boat capsizes, John and the children attempt to swim ashore. However, they swim into the path of a reckless motorboat and are struck. John and one of the kids are killed.

Eight years later, Angela, the surviving child, is now traumatized. She has been living with her eccentric aunt, Dr. Martha Thomas, and her cousin Ricky Thomas. Angela and Ricky are sent to Camp Arawak. Due to her introverted nature, Angela is bullied, with fellow camper Judy and camp counselor Meg her primary tormentors. The head cook, Artie, attempts to molest Angela as well. Later, an unseen figure causes Artie to get severely scalded by the water he is boiling. He is rushed to the hospital, and the incident is deemed accidental by camp owner Mel Costic.

Campers Kenny and Mike also mock Angela, prompting Ricky and his friend Paul to get into a fight with them. Paul befriends Angela. Kenny is later drowned after capsizing his canoe, his death also ruled accidental by Mel. Paul asks Angela to attend a movie with him and kisses her. Campers Billy and Jimmy throw a water balloon at Angela, and Billy is killed next, stung to death when someone traps him in a public toilet stall with a beehive, knowing that Billy is allergic to bee stings. Mel starts thinking there is a killer in the camp.

The relationship between Angela and Paul grows strained when Paul kisses her again, causing Angela to have a flashback to her youth when she and her sibling witnessed their father in bed with Lenny. Paul is seduced by Judy, and the two are found kissing by Angela. Guilty, Paul attempts to explain himself but is shooed away by Judy and Meg, who throw Angela into the water. Small children fling sand at Angela; she is comforted by Ricky, who swears revenge on her aggressors. Meg is later stabbed to death in the shower.

A camp social is held. At the event, Paul apologizes to Angela again and she tells him to meet her at the water. Mel finds Meg&#x27;s body. Four of the six children who threw sand at Angela are found hacked to bits. Soon after, Judy is killed by being vaginally penetrated with a hot electric curling iron. The camp is thrown into a panic with all the deaths. Thinking Ricky is the killer, Mel beats him into unconsciousness, then runs into the woods and encounters the real killer. In shock as to who it is, he appears to recognize the assailant before being killed with an arrow to the throat.

Police begin searching for the missing campers. Paul is at the beach with Angela, who suggests they go for a swim. The policeman discovers Ricky, unconscious but alive. Ronnie and Susie find a naked Angela humming and clutching a hunting knife and Paul&#x27;s severed head. They are shocked to discover that &quot;Angela&quot; is actually Peter, her thought-to-be-dead brother. It is revealed that the real Angela died in the accident and Peter survived. After Martha gained custody of him, she decided to raise Peter as the girl she always wanted, already having a son. It is implied that Peter was mentally affected by seeing his father sharing a homosexual embrace with another man.

The nude and blood-covered &quot;Angela&quot; (with male genitalia in full view), stands before the shocked Susie and Ronnie who discover that she is the killer; Angela stares vacantly at both of them, hissing and growling at them as the screen fades to green.

==Cast==
==Production==
The filming of &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; took place in Argyle, New York near Summit Lake at a camp formerly known as Camp Algonquin. In interviews, screenwriter and director, Robert Hiltzik, has said that he attended that camp as a child. The movie was filmed in five weeks starting in September 1982 and ending in October on a budget of $350,000. The film had been storyboarded but after the first day of filming, the film was already behind schedule. The storyboards could not be used and were thrown out. The trees, with their leaves turning, belie the summer setting of the film.

Unlike many of its contemporaries, which had adults portraying youth, the cast of &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; was primarily made up of adolescent actors.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; premiered in New York City on November 18, 1983. It had its premiere in Los Angeles the following spring on May 25, 1984, screening in fifteen theaters and earning $90,000 during its opening weekend. On June 10, the film ranked among the top-twenty highest grossing films at the U.S. box office that week. By the end of its theatrical run, it had gone on to gross a total of $11 million.

===Critical response===
====Contemporary====
Upon its original release, the film was frequently compared to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; due to their shared settings and whodunit plot structure. A review in &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; characterized the film as a &quot;low-budget slasher in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; mold, with teen-age mayhem at a summer camp&quot;, while Rick Lyman of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; uniformly lambasted the film, criticizing its performances, writing, and twist ending. Linda Gross of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt the film was derivative and gruesome, but conceded that its pacing was adept and that director Hiltzik portrayed the often cruel and abusive behavior of teenagers towards another young person.

In the &quot;Chula Vista Star-News&quot;″s review, the film was deemed &quot;a tasteless picture about mysterious murders at a summer youth camp that obscenely blends beheadings, stabbings, pubescent impulses, homosexuality, and transvestism&quot; with a cast of junior-high-school actors. George Williams of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; made similar criticisms of the acting, and described the film as &quot;mindless&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot;. Paul Willistein of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; described the film as &quot;simply horrible&quot;, writing that its campy sensibility is unsuccessful as it is &quot;intended to be a bonafide horror film&quot;.

&quot;The News-Press&quot; gave it a favorable review, calling it &quot;a shockingly good slasher film, if you use the relatively fine, first &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; as a measuring stick... it&#x27;s just another crazed killer stalking nubile summer campers. But, this time, there are some truly creative killings and interesting plot twists&quot;.

====Modern assessment====
In the years since its release, &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; has developed a cult following and garnered critical reappraisal. Its twist ending has been distinguished by audiences and critics as one of the most shocking in the slasher genre&#x27;s history, as well as in cinema history in general.

 On Metacritic, the film was reviewed by four critics and got a rank of 58 out of a 100, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

The website &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; gave the film a positive review, praising Felissa Rose&#x27;s performance and the film&#x27;s twist ending calling it &quot;one of the most shocking seen since, possibly, Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;&quot;. AllMovie wrote in its review on the film: &quot;While most of the gender-bending story&#x27;s sexual confusion is ultimately half-baked... &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; is distinctive enough to warrant required viewing for genre enthusiasts&quot;.

Film scholar Bartłomiej Paszylk called the film &quot;an exceptionally bad movie but a very good slasher&quot;. Commenting on the performances in the film, film scholar Thomas Sipos wrote that &quot;[the film] feels odd due to its contrasting acting styles. Most of the cast performs in a naturalistic manner, whereas Desiree Gould&#x27;s performance as Aunt Martha is strikingly stylistic: broadly overplayed to the point of caricature&quot;.

In his book &quot;The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: A Historical Survey&quot; (2009), Paszylk characterized &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; as &quot;elevat[ing] the kids to the position of the movie&#x27;s mass protagonist and becomes a tricky metaphor of the unspeakable pains and anxieties of growing up&quot;. He further commented on the film&#x27;s conclusion: &quot;The epiphanous ending brings &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; further away from the likes of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and closer to such 1980s &#x27;slashers with a twist&#x27; as &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; (1981) and &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; (1986), but Hiltzik&#x27;s movie goes even further than that: in this case the denouement doesn&#x27;t just add a new dimension to everything we saw up to this point, but it pushes its way deep into our minds and stays with us forever&quot;.

The film was featured on episode 48 of the podcast &quot;How Did This Get Made?&quot; where hosts Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas, June Diane Raphael, and guest host Zack Pearlman struggled to decipher the film&#x27;s opening moments, due to the ambiguous relationships established at the beginning of the film. Scheer later recalled that it had been the most fan-requested film &quot;by a landslide&quot;.

====Criticism====
&quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; has garnered contemporary criticism for its representation of a transgender villain. Willow Maclay, a transgender writer for &quot;Cléo&quot; magazine, criticized the film for its &quot;equation of mental instability with having grown up in a gender role not concurrent with your identity. Nearly every single transgender person grows up being raised in a gender role that does not fit, and that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are mentally ill or seriously violent&quot;. BJ Colangelo, in an editorial for &quot;Dread Central&quot;, similarly felt the film had transphobic and homophobic implications due to its representation of Angela and Angela&#x27;s gay father, but conceded that the film has metaphorical merit for showing the unfavorable and violent consequences for a character who is forced into gender roles that do not align with their identity.
Calpernia Addams, a transgender author and activist, commented in a 2021 interview with &quot;Fangoria&quot; that the character of Angela &quot;is not even really trans...  This whole situation with Angela is a child who was forced into this quote-unquote transition&quot;. She compared the character to David Reimer, a Canadian man who, as a child, was forced by his parents to live as a girl following a botched circumcision. Addams further stated that the film should be assessed in the context of the period in which it was made: &quot;I would just say that I enjoy &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; for what it is, which is schlocky &#x27;80s horror with a unique twist ending. And I think it&#x27;s the worst possible portrayal of a supposedly trans storyline, &quot;à la&quot; Buffalo Bill, or &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, or any of those types of films. But at the same time, I don&#x27;t want it censored or canceled. And if you just sit back and let yourself, it can be an enjoyable watch&quot;.
Transgender writer Alice Collins of &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; said that &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; &quot;is steeped in queerness, especially when compared to its contemporaries. In its day it took a deeper look into the subject matter than that of other films. Angela and Peter&#x27;s dad is a closeted gay man, there&#x27;s forced gender bending (which is abuse rather than queer but people will see it as such), and the majority of the scantily clad people in the film are men with all those very short shorts that leave little to the imagination while there is little skin shown of the feminine variety&quot;. Collins argues that Angela is a transgender girl, noting that, in the film&#x27;s sequels, Angela is presented as a woman who uses feminine pronouns: &quot;So despite Aunt Martha being insane, she just happened to stumble upon a person who was already a girl; and it was an accident that her brainwashing worked&quot;.

Actress Felissa Rose defended the film in a 2023 interview: &quot;I absolutely don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s transphobic. I feel as though Angela was a typical adolescent trying to find her gender identification and sexual orientation and I thought that was extremely exciting for 1982. It was ahead of its time. You can see with her father and his lover as well as her relationship with Paul [her camp crush], who she was trying to understand her relationship with, I feel like it was an adolescent story of a young person coming of age&quot;.

===Home media===
In the United Kingdom, the film was released on VHS by CBS/Fox Video under the alternative title &quot;Nightmare Vacation&quot; in the spring of 1984.

In the United States, Anchor Bay Entertainment released &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; on DVD on August 8, 2000. Anchor Bay reissued this disc as part of a four-disc set titled the &quot;Sleepaway Camp Survival Kit&quot; on August 20, 2002, which also contained the film&#x27;s two sequels, as well as a bonus disc featuring footage from the unfinished third sequel. This boxed set, which featured a medical red cross on the front cover, was discontinued in late 2002 after the Red Cross filed a complaint against Anchor Bay, which subsequently redesigned the box art to remove the cross logo. In 2005, the Canadian-based Legacy Entertainment released a region-free budget DVD release of the film. Unlike the original VHS release, this release contains numerous edits to the film to either shorten violence or certain moments like dialogue.

Scream Factory released the film in a collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray set on May 27, 2014. This release contains a 2K scan of the original camera negative, and this release also has the film in its original uncut version, unlike the DVD released by Anchor Bay.

===Sequels===
In the late 1980s, Hiltzik sold the rights to the successive &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; films, after which Michael A. Simpson directed two sequels, &quot;Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers&quot; (1988) and &quot;Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland&quot; (1989). In them, Angela (now played by Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s younger sister, Pamela Springsteen) resurfaces at a nearby summer camp, but this time masquerading as a counselor after a sex reassignment surgery. Much like at the previous camp, she gleefully tortures and kills anyone who misbehaves or annoys her. These films had more of a satirical comic tone than the original.

Another sequel, &quot;Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor&quot;, directed by Jim Markovic, was partially filmed in the early 1990s but left incomplete. In 2002, the unfinished footage was released and made available as an exclusive fourth disc in Anchor Bay/Starz Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; DVD boxed set. In 2012, the film was completed using archival footage from the first three films and released on DVD and Amazon Video on Demand.

A fifth film, &quot;Return to Sleepaway Camp&quot;, was completed in 2003 and initially struggled to have its visual effects completed. It was directed by Robert Hiltzik, the director of the original 1983 film. According to &quot;Fangoria&quot;, the digital effects were redone from 2006 to 2008. The film was released in 2008.

The purportedly final film in the &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; series, titled &quot;Sleepaway Camp Reunion&quot;, was also announced to be in the works. Distribution had been arranged via Magnolia Pictures. Creator Robert Hiltzik, who recovered the rights to the franchise, has stated that he would make the film if his budget was met. However, Hiltzik and &quot;Return To Sleepaway Camp&quot; producer Jeff Hayes later announced themselves as having started work on a reboot that would retain the key characters and elements of the original film with additional storyline elements and a dose of modernizing. As of Summer 2014, Hiltzik was reportedly tweaking the script. In addition, Michael Simpson, the director of &quot;Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers&quot; and &quot;Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland&quot;, wrote a script for an additional film called &quot;Sleepaway Camp: Berserk&quot;.

Karen Fields reprised her role from &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; in the 2014 short film &quot;Judy&quot;, although it wasn&#x27;t technically a sequel. The Jeff Hayes-directed film was included in the collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray release of the original &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;.

By December 2020, another &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; installment was announced to be in development, starring Felissa Rose.

<doc id="715217" wikidata="Q28783" url="?curid=715217" title="Michael Buffer">
<text>Michael Buffer (born November 2, 1944) is an American ring announcer (or &quot;MC&quot;) for boxing, professional wrestling, and National Football League events. Pioneering a distinct announcing style in which he rolls certain letters and adds other inflections to a fighter’s name, and known for his trademarked catchphrase: &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot;, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Buffer was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 2, 1944. His father was enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. Buffer&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 11 months of age, and he was then raised by foster parents, a school bus driver and housewife, in Roslyn, Pennsylvania. He enlisted in the United States Army during the Vietnam War at age 20 and served until age 23. He held various jobs including a car salesman, then began a modeling career at age 32 before becoming a ring announcer at age 38.

==Career==
===Boxing===
In 1982, Buffer began his career as a ring announcer. By 1983, he was announcing all boxing matches promoted by Bob Arum&#x27;s Top Rank on ESPN, which gave him a national identity at a time when ring announcers were strictly locally hired talent. By 1984, Buffer developed the catchphrase &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; in his announcing, which gained enormous popularity. He began the process of obtaining a federal trademark for the phrase in the 1980s, acquiring it in 1992. Consequently, Buffer has earned in excess of $400 million with the license for his trademark.

By the late 1980s, Buffer was the exclusive ring announcer for all bouts in Donald Trump-owned casinos. Trump said of Buffer, &quot;He&#x27;s great, he&#x27;s the choice, he has a unique ability ... I told my people, &#x27;We got to have him. Buffer&#x27;s work was also admired by many boxing greats. Sugar Ray Leonard once told Buffer, &quot;When you introduce a fighter, it makes him want to fight.&quot; 

In 1991, Buffer signed a deal with HBO and became a permanent ring announcer on World Championship Boxing and on occasion he would sub for Jimmy Lennon Jr. on rival network Showtime on &quot;Showtime Championship Boxing&quot; and Lennon would occasionally sub for Buffer on HBO as well.

In 2018, Buffer signed with DAZN to serve as the exclusive ring announcer for all of its boxing broadcasts, which include deals with Matchroom.

Buffer was formerly the exclusive ring announcer for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) main events featuring Hulk Hogan or other top WCW talent until 2001, when the organization folded. WCW&#x27;s former parent company Time Warner owned through their pay-per-view subscription division HBO, which broadcast many matches from promoter Top Rank, of which Buffer is the lead ring announcer. The exclusivity of his contract with WCW prevented Buffer from announcing for other wrestling-type organizations, forcing him to stop announcing for the UFC (his only UFC cards were UFC 6 and UFC 7). However, when WCW ceased to exist, and Time Warner had no more affiliation with professional wrestling, Buffer was enabled to announce in other wrestling promotions. During the Monday Night War, while Buffer was on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, WWF wrestler Triple H created the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to suck it!&quot; to mock him, as part of his D-Generation X gimmick.

On &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXV&quot;, for the first time in more than six years, Buffer returned to pro-wrestling ring announcing duties at Madison Square Garden in a boxing match between pro boxer Evander Holyfield (who was substituting for Montel Vontavious Porter) and pro wrestler Matt Hardy. Buffer appears in the Royal Rumble 2008 advertisement, in which he begins to say &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; only to be superkicked by Shawn Michaels, causing him to fall over. As well as being in the commercial for the event, he was the guest ring announcer during the Royal Rumble match itself.

===Other sports===
During his career, Buffer has announced the MLB World Series, the Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, the Volunteer 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, and NFL playoff games. He was a guest announcer at the 1999 Indianapolis 500 and the 2017 United States Grand Prix.

Buffer, like his brother Bruce, announced early UFC fights, starting at UFC 6 in 1995. He was the host of the Versus boxing retro show &quot;Legends of the Ring&quot;, produced by Top Rank, Inc., where he was ring announcer for most of their top matches.

On July 19, 2008, he announced the &quot;&quot; mixed martial arts show. On November 10, 2008, Buffer started the heads-up action between the two remaining players, Peter Eastgate and Ivan Demidov at the 2008 World Series of Poker final table with a modified version of his trademark statement: &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to shuffle up and deal.&quot;

On September 12, 2021, Buffer announced for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; matchup, where the Los Angeles Rams hosted the Chicago Bears at the first regular season NFL game with fan attendance in SoFi Stadium. He later announced at the Rams&#x27; first home playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals on January 17, 2022, and two weeks later, during the 2022 NFC Championship game against the San Francisco 49ers.

On June 28, 2024, Buffer announced his hometown Philadelphia Flyers&#x27;s 13th overall pick of the first round of the 2024 NHL entry draft at the Sphere in Vegas using his trademarked catchphrase, introducing draft pick Jett Luchanko with his height and weight like Buffer would in the ring, along with Luchanko&#x27;s previous team.

In February 2025, Buffer made the trip to England to announce the opening match of the Super League season at the Brick Community Stadium between defending champions the Wigan Warriors and local rivals the Leigh Leopards.

===Other appearances===
Buffer has appeared on various talk shows hosted by Jay Leno, David Letterman, Arsenio Hall, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon. He has also appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot; and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

He appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; on December 10, 2007, and opened the finale of the seventh season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, a production of RTL. In 2011 he made an appearance on the 12th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; to announce Sugar Ray Leonard week 3 dance. Buffer has also served as ringside announcer for the syndicated television game show &quot;The Grudge Match&quot;, hosted by Steve Albert and Jesse Ventura.

In the 1997 film &quot;Hercules&quot;, Hades uses Buffer&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; during Hercules&#x27; fight with Hydra.

He has played himself in various films including &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; and &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, and in 2008 Buffer appeared as Walbridge, the main villain in the comedy &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;. His &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; soundbite is used briefly in the 2004 film &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;. He also appeared in the 2019 remake of &quot;Dumbo&quot;, portraying a ringmaster who delivers the line &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready for Dumbo!&quot; in his trademark cadence.

Buffer has been animated in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;. Buffer also appears in the animated TV series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; in the episode &quot;Raging Bully&quot;, as the voice of the announcer for the big thumb-wrestling match with Phineas and Buford. Buffer appeared in the extended version of the Muppets webisode &quot;Food Fight&quot;, where he is seen announcing the cooking competition between Gordon Ramsay and the Swedish Chef.

He&#x27;s regularly featured in music, including on the introductory track of Tupac Shakur&#x27;s All Eyes on Me—his voice here was originally intended for a separate track titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready To Rumble&quot;, which did not appear on the final album. He appears as featuring artist on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rumble&quot; and &quot;Go for It All!&quot; by German eurodance group the K.O.&#x27;s and his voice was sampled in the Ant &amp; Dec song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rhumble&quot;. He recorded the introduction track for country artist Josh Turner&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;Punching Bag&quot;.

In 2013, Buffer appeared in Progressive Insurance commercials, promoting their program of combining different coverages into one policy, with a parody of his famous phrase – &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to bundle!&quot;

Buffer reproduced as an action figure in both Toy Biz&#x27;s WCW line and Jakks Pacific&#x27;s Rocky line.

In 2022, Buffer introduced Daddy Yankee&#x27;s final album &quot;Legendaddy&quot;.

Buffer was confirmed as the master of ceremonies for Probellum: Revolution at Dubai’s Coca-Cola Arena on Saturday, December 11.

===Trademark===
Buffer began using the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; in 1984. By 1992, he acquired a federal trademark for the phrase. Buffer uses his famous phrase in various licensing deals including the platinum selling album &quot;Jock Jams&quot; by Tommy Boy Records, the video games &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing&quot;, &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2&quot; for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo 64, Dreamcast and Game Boy Advance and &quot;Greatest Heavyweights&quot; for the Sega Genesis and numerous other products. In addition, he has used variations of the phrase in advertisements, including the popular commercial for Mega Millions in which he says &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to Win Big!&quot; and the Kraft Cheese commercial in which he says &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to Crumble!&quot; and most recently for Progressive Insurance in which he says &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to bundle!&quot;
, the catchphrase has generated $400 million in revenue from licensing the trademark.

==Personal life==
Buffer&#x27;s fame has reunited him with long-lost family members. In 1989, he was contacted by his birth father, who introduced him to his half-brothers after seeing him on television. In the mid-1990s, Buffer brought along one of his half-brothers, Bruce Buffer, as his agent/manager. This grew into a business partnership to increase licensing productivity of the trademark.

Buffer first wed at age 21, but the marriage ended in divorce after seven years. He has two sons from his first marriage. More than 25 years passed before he remarried in 1999. He and his second wife divorced in 2003.

On September 13, 2007, while making an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Buffer proposed to his current (third) wife, Christine. He resides in Southern California. His half-brother Bruce is an announcer for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a leading mixed martial arts promotion.

In 2008, Buffer was treated for throat cancer.

<text>John Beradino (born Giovanni Berardino, May 1, 1917 – May 19, 1996) was an American Major League Baseball infielder and actor. Known as Johnny Berardino during his baseball career, he was also credited during his acting career as John Berardino, John Baradino, John Barardino or John Barradino.

==Early life and education==

Beradino was born in Los Angeles and was raised near Hollywood. He attended Belmont High School in downtown Los Angeles. Beradino won a football scholarship to the University of Southern California in 1936, but he soon switched to baseball.

Although Beradino is sometimes believed to have appeared in the silent &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies as a child actor, he has not been identified as having appeared in any of the existing films.

==Career==
===Baseball===
After attending the University of Southern California, where he played baseball under coach Sam Barry and was member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, Beradino was a major league player from 1939 to 1952, except for three years of military service in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II from 1942 to 1945. He played for the St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians and Pittsburgh Pirates, winning the World Series with the Indians in 1948. While primarily a middle infielder, playing second baseman or shortstop, he also played first and third base.

After injuring his leg and being released by Pittsburgh in 1952, he retired from baseball and returned to acting, having appeared in his first film in 1948.

===Acting===
Beradino appeared briefly in an uncredited role as a state trooper in the 1954 thriller &quot;Suddenly&quot;, starring Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden, and later performed as a policeman who allows Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) to make a phone call to his mother in the 1959 Hitchcock thriller &quot;North by Northwest&quot;.

Beradino (still billed as John Berardino) played a cameo role in the 1954 sci-fi thriller &quot;Them!&quot;. He also appeared in a 1956 episode of the television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; titled &quot;The Unlucky Number&quot; as a small-time criminal struggling to reform.

Beradino appeared twice on the Western series &quot;Annie Oakley:&quot; as Gorman in &quot;Annie Rides the Navajo Trail&quot; and as Roscoe Barnes in &quot;Amateur Outlaw&quot; (both 1956). He appeared as an outlaw in the opening scenes of Budd Boetticher&#x27;s&quot;Seven Men From Now&quot; in 1956. He guest-starred on John Bromfield&#x27;s syndicated crime drama with a modern Western setting, &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;, and Bromfield&#x27;s successor series, &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;. He was also cast in an episode of David Janssen&#x27;s crime drama series &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;.

Beradino played a minor gangster in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; pilot that originally aired as an installment in the &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;. He then played the recurring role of gangster Augie Viale in two episodes from the first season of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; series, &quot;The Jake Lingle Killing&quot; and &quot;One-Armed Bandits&quot;.

December 2, 1959, Beradino appeared in the episode &quot;The Third Strike&quot; of the syndicated adventure series &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, playing a professional baseball player who loses consciousness when struck by a wild pitch and awakens with short-term amnesia.

After appearing in more than a dozen B-movies, as well as in supporting roles on the series &quot;I Led Three Lives&quot; and &quot;The New Breed&quot;, he was offered the role of Dr. Steve Hardy on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Beradino also played a version of his &quot;General Hospital&quot; character on an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;.

==Recognition==

For his contribution to the television industry, Beradino has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. He has also been inducted into the University of Southern California Athletic Hall of Fame.

He is the only person to have won a World Series (1948) and have his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1993).

Beradino received three Daytime Emmy Award nominations for best actor in a daytime drama.

In tribute, &quot;General Hospital&quot; left Beradino&#x27;s image with that of Rachel Ames in its opening sequence for more than a year after his death, through several updates. His image was finally removed in early 1998, but an action clip of Beradino&#x27;s character remained in the sequence until its 2004 retirement.

==Personal life and death==

Beradino had two children, Toni and Cindy. from his first marriage and two children, Katherine Ann and John Anthony from his second marriage. He had a third wife, Marjorie, when he died.

Beradino was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1996 and died later that year, aged 79, on May 19, 1996 in his Los Angeles home.

Beradino supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

== Early life ==
Glover was born in Hampstead, London, the son of Honor Ellen Morgan (née Wyatt), a BBC journalist, and Claude Gordon Glover, a BBC radio producer. Glover and Wyatt divorced in the 1940s, after the birth of a daughter, Prue, and Honor Wyatt subsequently married George Ellidge. Julian Glover&#x27;s younger half-brother is the musician Robert Wyatt.

Glover attended Bristol Grammar School, where he was in the same class as future actors Timothy West and David Prowse. He also attended Alleyn&#x27;s School in Dulwich, London. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1954. He also performed national service in the British Army, where he went on the officers&#x27; training course.

== Career ==
In the early 1950s, Glover appeared in several shows at Unity Theatre, London, and played Tolen in Ann Jellicoe&#x27;s &quot;The Knack&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in 1962.

Glover later recorded DVD commentaries for &quot;The Crusade&quot; episode &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot; (from the &quot;Lost in Time&quot; set) and for &quot;City of Death&quot;.

In the 1980s, Glover made some of his most notable appearances: the Imperial general Maximilian Veers in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), the ruthless Greek villain Aristotle Kristatos in the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981) and the deceptive American Nazi collaborator Walter Donovan in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989).

On television, he played the leading role of Sir Martin Lacey in the BBC English Civil War drama series &quot;By the Sword Divided&quot;, and played the guest role of surgeon Arnold Richardson in a 1989 episode of the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; (he made a second guest appearance as a different character in 2011, and also appeared as a different character again in the sister series &quot;Holby City&quot; in 2014). He played a leading role in the British film &quot;Brash Young Turks&quot; in 2016.

In the 2002 film version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Glover voiced the giant spider Aragog.

Glover has been associated with the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; since the 1980s and has delivered staged interpretations in various forms, often taking the role of an Anglo-Saxon gleeman or traveller poet, delivering an abridged version of the tale while standing around a mead hall hearth and rendering selected passages in the poem&#x27;s original Old English. This adaptation has been shown in documentaries on both the English language and Anglo-Saxon England and was also used for historian Michael Wood&#x27;s documentary on the poem broadcast during the BBC Poetry Season in 2009. He adapted his interpretation in novel form as &quot;&quot;.

In 2009, Glover played the role of Mr. Brownlow in the West End revival of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In the short film &quot;Battle for Britain&quot; (2010), Glover played a 101-year-old Polish veteran Royal Air Force pilot.

In 2013, Glover played the role of General Beauvilliers in the BBC Four drama series &quot;The Spies of Warsaw&quot;. In May 2014, he played the character Joe Goodridge in two episodes of the BBC TV medical drama series &quot;Holby City&quot; (&quot;My Name is Joe&quot; and &quot;No Apologies&quot;). In the same year, he portrayed an old man in horror thriller &quot;Backtrack&quot; as well as a theater performance as The Interlocutor in the 2014 West End transfer of the Scottsboro Boys in October.

== Honours ==
Glover was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

== Personal life ==

<text>Brooke Allison English (formerly Cudahy, Chandler, and Martin) is a fictional character on the television soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. Originated by Elissa Leeds on March 10, 1976, she was portrayed by Julia Barr from June 1976 to June 1981 and from November 1982 to December 20, 2006. Harriet Hall played the role from June 1981 through March 1982. Barr made a special appearance as Brooke on January 5, 2010, as part of the series&#x27; 40th anniversary, and returned on February 23, 2010, for a two-month stint until April 23, 2010. She later returned for the show&#x27;s final week on ABC on September 16, 2011. She returned as Brooke on the Prospect Park&#x27;s continuation of &quot;All My Children&quot;.

Barr earned eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations for the role, and won twice in 1990 and 1998 for Best Supporting Actress.

==Storylines==
In 1976, Brooke English arrived on the doorstep of Phoebe Tyler (Ruth Warrick), her aunt, as a wild teenager who was struggling to find her true love. She moved into the Tyler Mansion and started dating Dan Kennicott (Daren Kelly). She also continued to see her old boyfriend, the dangerous Benny Sago (Vasili Bogazianos). She pitted the two men against each other, and they fought for her affections. She was out of control, so much so that Phoebe nearly shipped her home. Benny had tried to blackmail Phoebe into letting Brooke stay.

Brooke soon stopped caring about Dan and Benny and fell for Tom Cudahy (Richard Shoberg). He was also being pursued by Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), and the two women&#x27;s longstanding rivalry was born. Erica managed to win Tom&#x27;s heart and he married her. Brooke returned to her relationship with Dan, where she was the mistress, as he was seeing Devon Shepherd.

Phoebe, faking paralysis, caught Dan and Brooke in a compromising situation, and threatened to throw out Brooke again. This was offset when Brooke found out about Phoebe&#x27;s fake paralysis and blackmailed her into keeping her in the Tyler Mansion. Dan eventually broke up with Devon and wanted to try a relationship with Brooke again.

Brooke, however, soon started sleeping with Erica&#x27;s half brother Mark Dalton (Mark LaMura). Mark made it clear that the relationship was only about sex. Dan discovered the relationship and left town. Brooke, still trying to find the right man, began an affair with Eddie Dorrance (Warren Burton), manager of singer Kelly Cole. He later ended up raping her. When he was killed, Brooke learned that was pregnant with his child. She chose to terminate the pregnancy.

Brooke and Tom began to have an affair, as Tom had separated from Erica. When Erica returned from California as an unsuccessful actress, she convinced Tom to give their marriage another try. Her lies finally caused Tom to divorce her and propose to Brooke. The two married.

Brooke had slightly grown out of her teenage rebellious phase, and took a job as a reporter. She made the discovery that her mother, Peg English, was the leader of an international drug cartel known as The Cobra. It was yet to be revealed that Brooke was adopted. her father and Phoebe&#x27;s brother died and Peg was sent to prison. Before she could reveal who Brooke&#x27;s real mother was, she was killed. This compounded onto the problem of Tom&#x27;s drinking. He and Erica, Brooke&#x27;s archrival, had an affair the night before Erica was to marry Adam Chandler (David Canary). This is while Brooke was pregnant with her and Tom&#x27;s child. Brooke was helped through the pregnancy by Mark, and gave birth to a daughter, Laura Cudahy.

Brooke had become a rising TV anchorwoman, but ran into problems with this. She exposed a municipal scandal and refused to reveal her source, and was sent to prison. When she got out of prison, there was an assassination attempt on her and Mark&#x27;s lives at a party. Erica&#x27;s fiancé, Mike Roy (Nikolas Surovy), took the bullet instead of Brooke &amp; Mark. Thinking that they were going to die during that ordeal, Mark and Brooke fell in love all over again. After a while, Brooke&#x27;s busy schedule led to her break up with Mark.

She briefly dated Giles St. Clair, a stuntman. But his lifestyle was too wild and interfered with her role as Laura&#x27;s mother. She also learned that her biological mother was a homeless woman named Jane Dorbin. Brooke tracked her down and the two built a relationship.

Brooke met one of Erica&#x27;s exes, the wealthy Adam Chandler (David Canary). The two fell in love. Brooke married Adam quickly. Their happiness was very short-lived when Brooke&#x27;s beloved daughter, Laura, was killed by a drunk driver. It is an event that stayed with Brooke for the rest of her life, as she continued to mourn the loss of her pride and joy.

When Brooke discovered that she could not bear any more children, Adam began to get anxious to have an heir to the Chandler fortune. He hired Dixie Cooney (Cady McClain), the niece of Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell), his bitter business rival, to be a nanny. He began to have an affair with her. She soon gave birth to his son, JR Chandler. The affair cost him his marriage to Brooke. They divorced, and Brooke began to work closely with Dixie&#x27;s true love, Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight).

Tad and Dixie married after Dixie&#x27;s brief marriage with Adam ended, but the marriage between Tad and Dixie also soon ended. When Tad and Dixie separated, he and Brooke had a brief affair. Tad was soon &quot;killed&quot; on a blown up bridge, fighting with Billy Clyde Tuggle. Soon after, Brooke discovered, much to her surprise, that she was pregnant! She told everyone that her pregnancy was because of artificial insemination to protect Dixie, after Tad had reconciled with her before he &quot;died&quot;. She then told the citizens of Pine Valley that she was pregnant with his best friend and former husband, Tom Cudahy&#x27;s child. Tom and Brooke led everyone to believe this which discouraged any thoughts that the baby might be Tad&#x27;s because Brooke did not want to cause any more pain to Dixie.

While Brooke was pregnant, she began to rely on Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey), another one of Erica&#x27;s old flames. The two grew close in friendship. Brooke nearly lost her baby when she and Jack were hit by Arlene Vaughan (Phyllis Lyons), who was driving drunk at the time. Despite having to be cut out of her car, Brooke gave birth to a healthy baby boy, James Edward Martin, whom she called Jamie. Her miracle child has become Brooke&#x27;s pride and joy, following the death of Laura.

Erica began to figure out a way to win Jack back. She prodded Brooke until Brooke saw that Jack still cared deeply for Erica. Brooke also went public with the fact that Jamie was Tad&#x27;s son. Brooke continued to raise Jamie. She began to see Edmund Grey (John Callahan), whose hot and cold behaviour left her angry and his obsession with discovering his lineage and birthright strained the ties between them. Brooke experienced a jolt when Tad returned to Pine Valley in 1993. Tad wanted to become a good father to Jamie, and married Brooke.

Once again, Tad&#x27;s love with Dixie would not be denied and they started to have another affair. Tad lied to Brooke about his whereabouts. Edmund knew the truth, and wanting to win back Brooke, he told her about Tad&#x27;s affair in hopes of breaking up Brooke&#x27;s marriage. Brooke vowed to stay with Tad. She became pregnant again, but tragedy would strike when it was discovered the pregnancy was ectopic. The termination of the pregnancy was necessary to save Brooke&#x27;s life. Shortly after, Brooke realized that Tad would never love her the same way he loved Dixie, so she ended their marriage. Brooke continued to have a cordial friendship with Tad, as Tad became Jamie&#x27;s father. Brooke began to focus on her career and raising her son.

Brooke was chosen as Pine Valley&#x27;s Woman of the Year. At the ceremony, Laura Kirk (Lauren E. Roman), a homeless teen, publicly accused Brooke of not doing enough to help the cause of the homeless. Brooke vowed to do more. She began to work closely with Laura, and they developed a bond. Adam wanted Brooke back, but she was still reeling from their previous marriage, which ended when he had an affair with Dixie. She stayed away from him and guarded herself. Adam and Liza Colby put together a scheme for Brooke to return to Adam and for Tad to return to Liza. Brooke realized that she didn&#x27;t love Adam enough to put up with him.

Brooke met and fell for Pierce Riley (Greg Wrangler) in 1996. He lived in the woods with Laura and Janet Green (Robin Mattson), an ex-con. When Pierce and Brooke began to date, Janet attempted to steal Brooke&#x27;s identity as she also had feelings for Pierce. Her scheme didn&#x27;t work. Brooke also brought Laura to her home and adopted her as her second daughter. However, Brooke wanted to devote more time to Jamie and Laura, so she broke up with Pierce. He left for New Mexico, but returned a few months later. Things began heating up between him and Brooke, and they became engaged.

But Pierce was a troubled man who was suffering from disturbing flashbacks that included gunshots and a woman from Pierce&#x27;s past. He painfully confessed to Brooke that he may have shot the woman in the flashbacks. She urged him to seek help and gave her support while he underwent psychological therapy. Undergoing hypnosis, Pierce remembered that he fell in love with the woman in his flashbacks, Christina, in Central America. They had a daughter named Amelia. He also remembered being forced to shoot either Christina or Amelia by a soldier. The soldier pulled the trigger of the gun in Pierce&#x27;s hands, shooting Christina. Pierce suffered a breakdown due to the memory, and Brooke vowed to look for Amelia.

No one knew that Christina was still alive. She survived the gunshot wounds and spent two decades in a Central American jail. When Brooke began looking for Amelia, the captors released Christina, who headed to Pine Valley under the name &quot;Diana Martinez&quot; to tell her story to the world-renowned reporter Brooke English. She didn&#x27;t know that Brooke was in love with Pierce. When the truth was exposed, Pierce had to choose between Brooke and Christina. Pierce soon left Pine Valley with Christina, devastating Brooke.

Brooke devoted her time to her work. She was nominated for an award in New York. On the way home to Pine Valley, her plane crashed. Everyone aboard was killed except for Brooke, Edmund, his daughter Maddie Grey and another man. Brooke tried to save the life of Edmund&#x27;s wife, Maria Santos Grey, but Maria made Brooke save Maddie&#x27;s life instead. The plane went over the cliff and into the water. Maria&#x27;s body was never found and was presumed dead, much to Edmund&#x27;s sadness. While searching for the truth behind the plane crash, she met a man that would help her through the ordeal, as he was the fourth survivor, Jim Thomasen.

Jim had trailed Brooke from New York, because he knew that she was a wealthy woman and had just adopted Laura. Laura and Jim had a past in New York. Jim took pornographic pictures of Laura when she was younger. Laura had posed for the pictures for money to help take care of her sick mother, Terry Kirk. Laura discovered that the photos remained on the Internet.

Brooke teamed with Jim to find out about why the plane crashed. Jim was with her every step of the way, and they learned that the plane&#x27;s crash was attributed to faulty turbine blades and that Adam Chandler was behind it.

Soon after, Laura was kidnapped by a drug addict named Ricky, who had posed in the pictures with Laura. He, unknown to Brooke, was hired by Jim. Brooke would find the pictures thanks to a tip-off and receive a ransom note demanding that the police were not to be notified about Laura&#x27;s disappearance. She obeyed and told Jim she would drop the money herself. Jim &quot;saved&quot; Laura, became a hero in Brooke&#x27;s eyes. Though she told Brooke that she knew Ricky, the former didn&#x27;t tell her mother that Jim had been the photographer after declaring a truce with him to keep it a secret between themselves.

Wanting Brooke for herself, Jim told Laura that she should move to Boston where no one would know her. Laura would leave Pine Valley after the New Year&#x27;s in 1998. Brooke was soon notified that there was new evidence in the plane crash. It was a luggage fragment that contained explosives.

Despite Jim&#x27;s warning to leave it alone, Brooke wouldn&#x27;t let it rest. While in Jim&#x27;s apartment, she went through his closet trying to find something and stumbled across the same style luggage found in the wreckage. She confronted him, and he explained it with lies. Brooke hired Mateo Santos to do undercover work and find out as much as he could about Jim.

The truth about Jim shocked Brooke. She arranged a meeting with him at the Chandler Gallery. She showed him the photos of Laura that he had taken. Jim promised that if she called the police, he would take the same type of photos of Jamie. This drove Brooke over the edge and she took out a gun, shooting Jim several times in the back.

Scared about the murder charges and convinced that she wouldn&#x27;t win the trial, Brooke went on the run with Jamie. Finally, Tad convinced her to return to Pine Valley and stand trial. Thanks to Tad&#x27;s secret maneuvering, Brooke was able to get an acquittal of murder. However, the event still haunted Brooke.

Laura would soon leave Pine Valley to study in China. Brooke began to date Dimitri Marick, again another former love of Erica. Erica succeeded in quickly ending the relationship. After that Brooke began to refocus on her career and raising Jamie.

In early 2000, Brooke began working herself to the bone at the community centre. Reverend Eliot Freeman soon found that this was for the guilt she felt about Laura&#x27;s death years before. It came to the surface when Arlene Vaughan was drunk and crashed her car into a telephone pole that broke through the community centre&#x27;s wall. Eliot comforted and consulted Brooke about the pain that she was still holding for her daughter&#x27;s death.

However, Brooke was unaware that Eliot had a secret he was keeping from her, his real identity. Before &quot;finding God,&quot; Eliot went by another name, Josh Waleski. He was the man who had killed her daughter. Eliot was eventually forced into telling Brooke that he was the man who had taken her daughter from him. Brooke erupted in a fury and lashed out at Eliot for having lied to her for months. More importantly, Brooke was left to question herself for allowing herself to fall in love with the man who had killed her daughter. Eliot decided to leave town to help Brooke heal. Before Eliot left for good, Brooke finally found a way to forgive Eliot.

The next year, Brooke&#x27;s adopted daughter Laura suffered an Ecstasy overdose. It aggravated a pre-existing heart condition. The only surgeon that could perform the risky operation was Dr. David Hayward, who was in prison. Brooke was helped by of all people, Erica, in order to free David. Laura survived the surgery but still needed a heart transplant.

That spring, Brooke begged Leo du Pres to pretend to be interested in the dying Laura in order to give Laura motivation to fight for her life. At first, Leo refused. But he soon grew closer with Laura. He seemed to really care for Laura and wanted to see her fully recover. Laura&#x27;s condition would soon worsen, and Brooke paid a married couple to donate the heart of their dead nephew.

On June 18, 2001, Leo proposed to Laura, and she accepted. They married two days later in her hospital room with Brooke, with friends and hospital staff in attendance. Laura&#x27;s health continued to worsen and the only way to save her life was for a heart transplant. Laura eventually received a heart transplant from Gillian Andrassy, who died after she was shot. In early 2002, Brooke convinced an unwinding Laura to seek out professional help.

Soon, Brooke began to suspect that Maria Santos Grey was still alive. She had seen a painting of Wildwind, the estate in Pine Valley that belonged to the Grey family, drawn by a Maureen Gorman. Brooke was convinced that Maureen Gorman was an alive Maria. She and Tad traveled to Nevada to find Maureen. When Brooke saw Maureen and realized it was indeed the long thought dead Maria, she fainted. Later that night, Tad went to find Maria, but saw a different girl and assumed that was who Brooke saw. He tried to convince Brooke that she just &quot;thought&quot; she saw Maria.

Brooke and Edmund finally married. At their wedding, Maddie saw Maria and followed her. She burst into the chapel moments later, announcing that she had been with her mother. This was just after the marriage ceremony was complete and Brooke and Edmund were officially married. Brooke finally admitted that she knew Maria was really alive, causing Edmund to find Maria. Their marriage was annulled, but Brooke continued to help Edmund reunite with Maria.

Following this, Brooke began an affair with Adam Chandler. Brooke told Adam that she would only continue the affair if it remained a secret. But soon Brooke realized that others knew about it, and she quickly ended the relationship.

Brooke began to rebuild her friendship with Edmund, after all of her deception. But she also began to worry about Jamie. Unknown to anyone, Jamie had slept with newcomer Babe Carey, the night before it was announced that Babe had married Jamie&#x27;s former stepbrother JR (Adam Jr.) in San Diego weeks before. Both had been drunk, but Babe still took Jamie&#x27;s virginity. Babe soon became pregnant, and Brooke worried that Jamie might be the father.

When it was revealed that the father of Babe&#x27;s daughter, Bess, was indeed JR and not Jamie, Brooke was relieved. However, it was then figured out that Bess was really Miranda Montgomery, the newborn daughter of Bianca.

Brooke&#x27;s world was rocked when Edmund was killed in the Wildwind barn one night. Brooke had to tell Maria that she was the executor of Edmund&#x27;s estate, and had more control over Maria&#x27;s children and the Wildwind estate than Maria. The two women remained at odds, until they found a way to co-exist for the sake of Maria&#x27;s children.

When her Aunt Phoebe died, Brooke was inconsolable. She soon found out that Phoebe had left everything to Jamie provided he dumped Babe. Jamie had a tough time letting go of Babe but eventually did. Jamie would later start a relationship with the recently returned Amanda Dillon, but after Amanda&#x27;s unstable mother Janet wreaked havoc on Pine Valley, Brooke welcomed a devastated Amanda into her home as if she were her daughter.

Eventually, Jamie and Amanda stopped seeing each other. Over the last couple of months in Pine Valley, Brooke remained in the background, focusing on raising Jamie and Amanda. She also became a stepping stone in the renewed relationship of Erica and Jack. While the two were separated, Erica invited her first husband Jeff Martin to Thanksgiving dinner, while Jack invited her bitter rival, Brooke. Brooke quickly realized that Jack didn&#x27;t love her like Erica. Quietly, Brooke left Pine Valley at the tail end of 2006. However, Brooke reappeared in the &quot;All My Children&quot; 40th anniversary special four years later and on February 23, 2010, she returned until departing again exactly two months later. In that short period of time, Brooke and her ex-husband Adam Chandler went off into the sunset together in a particularly romantic happy ending.

In 2006, Barr was taken off contract and was asked to remain with the show on a recurring basis, but she declined the offer. The producers then decided not to recast the role after her departure. For many years prior, Brooke had floundered in the background. Her last major story was her interrupted marriage to Edmund Grey which occurred in 2002. Despite 30 years of service to &quot;All My Children&quot;, at that time neither Barr nor Brooke received any formal farewell; the character simply vanished, and was then mentioned only infrequently. When she left, Barr said, &quot;I am so proud to have been a part of a show that was once a television icon.&quot;

Barr eventually returned in 2010, first with the &quot;All My Children&quot; 40th anniversary special in January, and then for a two-month stint from February to April during which time Brooke takes over as editor-in-chief of &quot;Tempo&quot;, is involved in a terrible car accident, and falls in love, all of which culminate with Brooke and her former husband Adam Chandler, reuniting and officially leaving town together.

Adam and Brooke returned to Pine Valley for the final episodes of the series in September 2011. They initially return to help a very troubled JR. Still a couple, Brooke is there with Adam when he discovers Stuart is alive and purchases the Chandler Mansion as a present for Adam with the inheritance money from her Aunt Phoebe after it is sold away from the family. The final scenes of the show take place in the Chandler mansion on September 23, 2011, during which Adam proposes to Brooke and she accepts.

Brooke is the first character to be seen in the reboot of the show. Adam re-proposes to Brooke, claiming she is the only woman he has ever truly loved, and she then accepts his proposal. She and Adam are the guardians of Adam&#x27;s grandson, AJ Chandler as his dad, JR has been in a coma for five years. She has an assistant, Celia Fitzgerald, who volunteers with her at the Miranda Center. Brooke also agrees to take over as Head of Chandler Enterprises, because Adam is travelling so much and spends much of her time helping Adam to rebuild the company that JR ruined before he was shot.

<text>Robin Victory in Europe Strasser (born May 7, 1945) is an American actress, best known for her role as Dorian Lord on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Strasser&#x27;s middle name is a tribute to her being born the day Germany surrendered in World War II. She was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx and raised in Manhattan by Martin and Anne Strasser, both Jewish. After graduating from the High School of Performing Arts, on full scholarship, she attended the Yale University School of Drama. She began acting in the early 1960s. Strasser sharpened her acting abilities in theatre, acting on Broadway, where she appeared in &quot;The Shadow Box&quot; and &quot;Chapter Two&quot;. Early in her stage career she met her first husband, Laurence Luckinbill; they were married in 1965 and divorced in 1976. They have two sons, Nicholas and Ben. Strasser was also married to Richard Hogan from August 27, 1983, until 1985.

She is a founding member of the American Conservatory Theater, and began her extensive daytime career in 1964. Her first role was as Iris on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;. In 1967, she originated the role of Rachel Davis Matthews on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot;. After leaving the role of Rachel, Strasser played Dr. Christina Karras Martin on &quot;All My Children.&quot;

Strasser was offered the role of Cathy Craig on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, but ended up joining the show as Dorian Lord in 1979, when Claire Malis left the role. Strasser had four stints as Dorian, leaving the show in 1987 and returning to play Dorian again from 1993 to 2000, 2003 to August 25, 2011, and then again in the online revival of the series in 2013. From 2001 to 2002, she appeared as 300-year-old witch Hecuba on the NBC serial &quot;Passions&quot;. In 2019 she played Vivian Alamain on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for 15 episodes.

Strasser won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series in 1982 for her portrayal of Dorian, and was also nominated for the award in 1981, 1983, and 1985. Strasser has been nominated for &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards for Dorian in various categories in 1986, 1988, 1994, 1995 and 2005, winning in 1996 (&quot;Outstanding Lead Actress&quot; for Dorian) and 2001 (&quot;Outstanding Female Scene Stealer&quot; for Hecuba).

Strasser was an Honorary Chair of the Imperial Court of New York&#x27;s Annual Charity Coronation Ball, &quot;Night of A Thousand Gowns,&quot; on March 21, 2009. She was previously made a Dame of the Imperial Court of New York in March 2007, and attended the 2008 &quot;Night of A Thousand Gowns.&quot;

<doc id="715238" wikidata="Q61046" url="?curid=715238" title="Richard Courant">
<text>Richard Courant (January 8, 1888 – January 27, 1972) was a German-American mathematician. He is best known by the general public for the book &quot;What is Mathematics?&quot;, co-written with Herbert Robbins. His research focused on the areas of real analysis, mathematical physics, the calculus of variations and partial differential equations. He wrote textbooks widely used by generations of students of physics and mathematics. He is also known for founding the institute now bearing his name.

==Life and career==
Courant was born in Lublinitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia (now in Poland). His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Freund of Oels. Edith Stein was Richard&#x27;s cousin on the maternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to Glatz, then to Breslau and in 1905 to Berlin. He stayed in Breslau and entered the university there, then continued his studies at the University of Zürich and the University of Göttingen. He became David Hilbert&#x27;s assistant in Göttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in World War I, but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the University of Münster in 1921 to take over Erich Hecke″s position at the University of Göttingen. There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933.

Courant left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being Jewish, as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.

In 1936, after one year at Cambridge, Courant accepted a professorship at New York University in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in applied mathematics. The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.

Courant and David Hilbert authored the influential textbook &quot;Methoden der mathematischen Physik&quot;, which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With Herbert Robbins he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled &quot;What is Mathematics?&quot;. With Fritz John he also coauthored the two-volume work &quot;Introduction to Calculus and Analysis,&quot; first published in 1965.

Courant&#x27;s name is also attached to the finite element method, with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943.
This method is now one of the ways to solve partial differential equations numerically. Courant is a namesake of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition and the Courant minimax principle.

Courant was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society (1953) and the United States National Academy of Sciences (1955). In 1965, the Mathematical Association of America recognized his contributions to Mathematics with their Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics.

Courant died of a stroke in New Rochelle, New York on January 27, 1972, aged 84.
==Perspective on mathematics==
Commenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant explained why the existence of a physical solution does not obviate mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:

==Personal life==
In 1912, Courant married Nelly Neumann, who had earned her doctorate at Breslau in synthetic geometry in 1909. They lived together in Göttingen until they were divorced in 1916. She was later murdered by the Nazis in 1942 for being Jewish.

In 1919, Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge (1891–1991), a daughter of the Göttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, Carl Runge (of Runge–Kutta fame).

Richard and Nerina had four children: Ernest, a particle physicist and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (1922–2014), a biologist and wife of the mathematician Jürgen Moser (1928–1999); Hans (1924-2019), a physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project; and Leonore (known as &quot;Lori,&quot; 1928–2015), a professional violist and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928–1998) and subsequently wife of mathematician Peter Lax until her death.

<text>The Croatia national football team (Croatian: &quot;Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija&quot; or &quot;Nogometna reprezentacija Hrvatske&quot;) represents Croatia in men&#x27;s international football matches. It is governed by the Croatian Football Federation (HNS), the governing body for football in Croatia. It is a member of UEFA in Europe and FIFA in global competitions. The team&#x27;s colours reference two national symbols: the Croatian checkerboard and the country&#x27;s tricolour. They are colloquially referred to as the (Blazers) and (Checkered Ones).

Since 2000, the have qualified for every major tournament with the exception of UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the World Cup, Croatia has finished second once (2018) and third on two occasions (1998, 2022), securing three World Cup medals. Davor Šuker won the Golden Shoe and the Silver Ball in 1998, while Luka Modrić won the Golden Ball in 2018 and the Bronze Ball in 2022. The team has reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship twice (1996, 2008). They finished second in the UEFA Nations League in 2023.

Upon its admission into FIFA in 1994 ranked 125th, they ascended to third place with their debut 1998 World Cup campaign. This marked the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA ranking history, making them the youngest team to ever reach a Top 10 place in the World Ranking. Croatia is the second-smallest country by population (after Uruguay) and land mass (after the Netherlands) to reach a World Cup final. At the World Cup, Croatia hold records for most penalty shoot-out played (4) and won (4) and most penalties saved in a shoot-out (3), among other team records. They were named FIFA Best Mover of the Year in 1994 and 1998, thus becoming the first national team to win the award twice and also equalling joint records with France and Colombia.

==History==
===Official formation===
The early history of Croatian football was delineated by a variety of unofficial sides as Croatia was not an independent entity until the late 20th century. Hugo Kinert first managed an unofficial side that played some international matches in 1918–19. In 1940, Jozo Jakopić led the national side representing the Yugoslav Banovina of Croatia in four friendly matches. Croatia&#x27;s first official international match was a 4–0 win over Switzerland in their capital city, Zagreb, on 2 April 1940. Following the 1941 Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Germany and Italy took control of Croatia, forming the Independent State of Croatia and installing Rudolf Hitrec as an unofficial manager for two years. The side played 15 friendly matches from its re-activation in FIFA in 1941 until the end of World War II. In 1945, Croatia returned to Yugoslavia as the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia with sides active until 1956. During the nation&#x27;s pre-independence, Croat footballers played for Yugoslavia at the Summer Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, and the UEFA European Championship from 1956 to 1990.

Croatia debuted their modern checkered jersey against the United States on 17 October 1990, winning 2–1. Caretaker manager Dražan Jerković, led the &quot;de facto&quot; national side before their formal re-admission into FIFA on 3 July 1992, winning two more friendly games against Romania in December 1990 and Slovenia in June 1991. Stanko Poklepović took over team management and led them on an exhibition tour against Australia, before he was succeeded by Vlatko Marković in April 1993. Croatia gained admission into UEFA in June 1993, three months after qualification for the 1994 World Cup started, missing their window to enter the competition. After winning a match against Ukraine in June 1993, Marković was succeeded by Miroslav Blažević in March 1994.

===Blažević period (1994–1999)===
After its independence from Yugoslavia, the newly formed Croatia entered the FIFA World Rankings in 125th place in March 1994. Blažević launched Croatia&#x27;s qualifying campaign for Euro 1996 with a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994 and a 1–0 away loss to Ukraine on 1 June 1995, their first competitive win and loss. After finishing first in qualifying, the team halved their spot in the World Ranking, ascending to number 62, winning FIFA&#x27;s 1994 Best Mover of the Year in December 1994. In the group stage of Euro 1996, Goran Vlaović scored the team&#x27;s first goal at a tournament, a late strike to win 1–0 against Turkey. Croatia then beat reigning champions Denmark 3–0, later losing to Portugal by the same scoreline. The team advanced to the knockout stage and were beaten in the quarter-finals 1–2 by Germany. Croatia&#x27;s qualifying campaign from 1998 to 1999 for Euro 2000 was unsuccessful as they finished third in their group behind FR Yugoslavia and the Republic of Ireland. Both fixtures against Yugoslavia ended in draws which prevented Croatia from qualifying by one point.

Croatia began their qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup with an aggregate victory against Ukraine in the two-legged playoff. In the group stage, Croatia beat both Jamaica and Japan, later losing to Argentina to advance with them to the knockout stage. A 1–0 victory over Romania moved the Croatians to the quarter-finals against Germany. Croatia beat the Germans 3–0 with goals from Robert Jarni, Goran Vlaović and Davor Šuker, all after Christian Wörns had been sent off. They advanced to their first semi-finals against the hosts France. After a goalless first-half, Croatia led after Aljoša Asanović pushed past Zinedine Zidane to cross a ball downfield to Šuker who scored after a one-on-one with goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. France&#x27;s defender Lilian Thuram equalized quickly after, and scored another goal later in the game to beat Croatia 2–1. In the third place playoff, Croatia prevailed against the Netherlands 2–1 to secure bronze and claim their first World Cup medal. Šuker won the Golden Shoe for scoring the most goals in the World Cup: six goals in seven games. The Croatians&#x27; performance during the late-1990s propelled them to rank third place in the FIFA World Ranking in January 1999. The team of the 1990s was dubbed the &quot;golden generation&quot; for their contributions to Croatia&#x27;s ascension in international football.

===Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)===

Croatia started their qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup with draws against Belgium and Scotland prompting Blažević&#x27;s resignation as head coach in October 2000. His successor, Mirko Jozić, pushed the team through the rest of qualifiers undefeated. In the group stage, Croatia narrowly lost to Mexico before beating Italy 2–1 and sustaining a 1–0 loss to Ecuador. The team was eliminated by one point, leading to the resignation of Jozić and succession of Otto Barić in July 2002, their first manager born outside of Southeastern Europe. During Barić&#x27;s tenure, most of the remaining players from the &quot;golden generation&quot; squad were gradually replaced by younger players over the course of qualifying for Euro 2004. Croatia qualified in a playoff victory against Slovenia, winning 2–1 on aggregate after Dado Pršo&#x27;s decisive late goal in the second leg. The team was eliminated at the group stage after drawing 0–0 with Switzerland and 2–2 with France, and losing 2–4 to England. Barić departed after his two-year contract expired in June 2004. Prior to launching the team&#x27;s qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Zlatko Kranjčar succeed Barić in July 2004. Croatia qualified undefeated, topping the group ahead of Sweden and Bulgaria. In the group stage, Croatia lost their opening game to Brazil and drew 0–0 with Japan after Darijo Srna missed a first-half penalty. A 2–2 draw with Australia in which three players were sent off confirmed Croatia&#x27;s elimination.

===Bilić period (2006–2012)===

In July 2006, prior to Euro 2008, Kranjčar was replaced with Slaven Bilić, who introduced newer, younger players to the squad and finished qualifying undefeated. His first game was a 2–0 victory against reigning world champions Italy during an international friendly. Croatia lost once to Macedonia and beat England twice, who as a result failed to qualify for the first time since 1984. Eduardo da Silva, the team&#x27;s top goalscorer during qualifying, sustained an injury while playing for his club, Arsenal, leading to a shake-up in the finals squad with less experienced players. Croatia finished group stage undefeated with a 1–0 win over co-hosts Austria, 2–1 win over Germany, and 1–0 win over Poland. The team collected the maximum group stage points possible (9) for the first time in their Euros history. Niko Kovač and Dario Šimić held captaincy during the group and knockout stages, respectively. Croatia pushed Turkey to a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals in which the Turkish side prevailed in an upset win where Luka Modrić, Mladen Petrić and Ivan Rakitić all missed their penalties. Croatia set multiple Euro records: fewest goals conceded (2), fewest games lost (0), and earliest goal scored.

Bilić renewed his contract in April 2008, before the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup. Croatia won 3–0 against Kazakhstan, before taking a 4–1 loss to England at Stadion Maksimir, their first home loss in 14 years. The team drew 0–0 with Ukraine and beat Andorra twice, drawing again with Ukraine and beating Belarus twice. In the final stretch of the qualifiers, England delivered Croatia&#x27;s then-heaviest loss, a 5–1 scoreline, at Wembley Stadium. The team had a number of players&#x27; injuries during qualifying and were ultimately eliminated, on points, as Ukraine defeated both England and Andorra to advance in the group.

Croatia was a candidate to co-host Euro 2012 with Hungary which would have resulted in automatic qualification for both countries; UEFA ultimately selected Poland and Ukraine. The Croatians began their qualifying campaign for Euro 2012 with a 3–0 win over Latvia, a goalless draw with Greece, and a 2–1 win against Israel. In the qualifying playoff against Turkey, the team won 3–0 on aggregate. They were grouped with the Republic of Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain, opening with a 3–1 victory over the Irish. Croatia drew with Italy 1–1 in a match marred by disruptive fans and controversial refereeing from English official Howard Webb. The side was knocked out by Spain in a 0–1 loss, which, along with 1–1 rematch with Italy, had Croatia eliminated. Bilić retired before Euro 2012, with the Croatians continuously ranked among the top ten teams in the world during his tenure – 2007 to 2012.

===Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)===

Succeeding Bilić, former player Igor Štimac was appointed manager while Davor Šuker assumed the presidency of the Croatian Football Federation in 2012 after the death of Vlatko Marković. A year in, Štimac was replaced by former captain Niko Kovač. Kovač led the team to a 2–0 aggregate victory over Iceland in the qualifying playoffs for the 2014 World Cup with both goals coming in the home leg in Zagreb. In the group stage, Croatia opened their campaign with a 3–1 loss to Brazil. The match garnered media attention for controversial refereeing from Yuichi Nishimura which was scrutinized for a number of decisions. In their second match, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon then lost 3–1 to Mexico, finishing third in the group and missing the knockout stage.During the qualifying campaign of Euro 2016, Croatia drew with Azerbaijan and lost to Norway, leading to Kovač&#x27;s replacement with Ante Čačić. The team broke their record for most goals scored in a match with a friendly 10–0 win over San Marino in June 2016. They topped the group stage of that year&#x27;s Euros, advancing with defending champions Spain. Croatia prevailed over Turkey 1–0 with a long-range volley goal from Luka Modrić, before drawing 2–2 draw against the Czech Republic. In the latter match, Croatia led with goals from Ivan Perišić and Ivan Rakitić, while opposing Czech striker Milan Škoda and a last-minute penalty from Tomáš Necid drew the match. There was severe crowd trouble and on-field flares in the game&#x27;s last minutes with a steward injured by a stray firework. Croatia then overtook Spain 2–1, confirming the Spaniards&#x27; first defeat at a Euro finals match since 2004. The Croatians were tipped as one of the tournament favourites as they entered the knockout stage with Portugal. The Portuguese prevailed 1–0 with Ricardo Quaresma&#x27;s winning goal in the 117th minute after Perišić hit the post with a header in the previous attack. Following the campaign, Darijo Srna announced his retirement and the succession of Modrić as team captain in August 2016.

===Dalić period (since 2017)===

Croatia qualified for the 2018 World Cup undefeated for their first five matches. Two defeats to Iceland and Turkey, as well as a draw against Finland, led to a public outcry that ousted manager Čačić. He was replaced by Zlatko Dalić, who formally qualified the team with a 2–0 win against Ukraine, and a 4–1 win with Greece, on aggregate, during a playoff round in the first leg in Zagreb. The 2017–18 squad was known as Croatia&#x27;s second &quot;golden generation&quot;, referencing their 1998 counterparts, during the side&#x27;s World Cup campaign. They topped their group with a 2–0 victory over Nigeria, a 3–0 win over Argentina, and a 2–1 win with Iceland – their best-ever group stage performance.

During the knockout stage, they beat Denmark in a penalty shoot-out for the first time after goalkeeper Danijel Subašić saved three penalties, equalling the record for most penalties saved in a shoot-out. In the quarter-finals, Croatia drew 2–2 with hosts Russia, becoming the first team since 1990 to win two consecutive penalty shoot-outs. Playing England in the semi-finals, Croatia equalized to force their third consecutive extra time, matching the tournament record. Mario Mandžukić and Perišić scored as Croatia won 2–1 making them the second-smallest country by population (after Uruguay) and land mass (after the Netherlands) to reach a World Cup final. In the World Cup final they lost to France 4–2, finishing in second place and securing the silver medal. The match was controversial for its refereeing. The team was welcomed by an estimated half a million people at their homecoming in Zagreb.

The team entered the Nations League&#x27;s inaugural 2018–19 edition in League A, along with England and Spain in January 2018. Croatia lost 6–0 away to Spain in their first game, the side&#x27;s record loss in a match. Croatia drew 0–0 home with England, played behind closed doors due to UEFA sanctions. The team then overtook Spain 3–2 with a goal in stoppage time, followed by a 2–1 away defeat to England. Croatia were set to be relegated to League B until a tournament rule change retained them in League A, grouping them with Portugal, France and Sweden in the 2020–21 tournament. Croatia lost to France and Portugal, but a victory against Sweden was sufficient to avoid relegation.

The team topped their group for the qualifying campaign of Euro 2020, with a loss to Hungary, and draws against Azerbaijan and Wales. The 2020 finals were delayed into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, winning only two out of eight games in 2020, Croatia achieved their worst-ever aggregate win-rate. Croatia finished second in their Euros group, with a 1–0 loss to England, a 1–1 draw with the Czech Republic and a 3–1 win over Scotland. They advanced to the round of 16, where they lost to Spain 5–3 after extra time. The loss to Spain led to heightened criticism against Dalić and the team by the Croatian public, a faction of whom called for resignations. Dalić refreshed the team roster by introducing younger debutants for the remainder of World Cup qualifying in 2021.

Croatia qualified for the 2022 World Cup with one loss, two draws and seven wins. The team advanced from group stage after a 0–0 draw with Morocco, a 4–1 win against Canada, and finished ahead of Belgium by a single point after drawing 0–0. They won against Japan in a penalty shootout in the round of 16 where Dominik Livaković saved three of four Japanese penalties, equalling a record held by Ricardo and Danijel Subašić. Croatia similarly beat Brazil during the quarter-finals in an upset victory on penalties, having come from behind to draw 1–1 in the final minutes of extra time. In the semi-final match, Croatia sustained their heaviest World Cup defeat, 3–0 against Argentina. They prevailed 2–1 over Morocco in the third place playoff, securing their second bronze medal.

The team topped their group in the 2023 Nations League, knocking out reigning champions France by winning 1–0 on a penalty – their first-ever win against the French. Croatia beat the Netherlands 4–2 in the semi-finals, advancing to their first Nations League final, against Spain. After drawing the Spanish 0–0 in extra time, the team lost the penalty shootout 4–5, finishing the tournament in second place. Croatia finished second in the qualifying for Euro 2024, being drawn into a &quot;group of death&quot; with Spain, Italy, and Albania. After a 3–0 loss to Spain, they drew 2–2 with Albania and 1–1 with Italy. The Italians shut them out of the knockout stage, on points, with a 98th minute stoppage-time goal from striker Mattia Zaccagni.

===Kits===

Croatia&#x27;s modern-day team jersey was created in 1990 by Miroslav Šutej, the designer behind the nation&#x27;s flag and coat of arms. The red-and-white motif is based on the Croatian checkerboard (). The typical kit color-way features red-and-white checkered shirts, white shorts and blue socks to match the Croatian tricolor (&quot;Trobojnica).&quot; There have been variations made by the kit manufacturers since the original release; the jersey design has remained consistent throughout the years and has served as a blueprint for other Croatian national sports teams and entities.

Meanwhile, the away kits used by the team have for a period been all-blue, incorporating the red-and-white checkers as a trim. Since then, Croatia has used darker colored away kits such as the dark navy-and-black checkered design that featured prominently in the 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign. The &quot;Vatreni&quot; have often been required to use their darker away kits even when playing at home because their opponents have red-and-white color schemes that clash with the chequers of Croatia.

===Supporters===

The team has developed an extensive fan base since the 1990s. Following their debut run at the 1998 World Cup, there was a rise in domestic and global attention for the side. Political scientist Alex J. Bellamy observed in 2003 that the national team became a symbol of statehood in Croatia after their independence through the cultural export of football. The government&#x27;s influence on team affairs eased substantially after the death of President Franjo Tuđman in 1999. All matches are followed and televised throughout the country, particularly during major tournaments. In November 2022, the Ministry of Science and Education issued guidance to let school children watch matches during the school day as long coursework is made up later. Following the 2018 World Cup, the Croatian Cabinet attended ministerial meetings in team jerseys, and during the 2022 World Cup, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković delivered a hurried speech &quot;[lasting] only 37 seconds&quot; at the Euro-Mediterranean Summit to catch the quarter-finals.

The Croatian Football Federation endorses an official fan club for the team, known as (&quot;Always Faithful&quot;). A part of the team&#x27;s support consists of fans of Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split, the two largest clubs in Croatia&#x27;s top domestic football league, the (HNL). Both sets of fans—Bad Blue Boys from Zagreb and Torcida from Split—have been associated with hooliganism due to their ultra-style support. Regional support for the team also comes from Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly from fans of domestic clubs Zrinjski Mostar and Široki Brijeg. The diaspora of Croatians across the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America contribute to the majority of the side&#x27;s international support. It is customary among supporters to include an inscription of their city of origin onto the Croatian flag. Fans also coordinate their vocal support and orchestrate chants during matches. One section may shout &quot;&quot; (&quot;To battle, to battle&quot;) with another responding &quot;&quot; (&quot;For our people&quot;). In addition to chants, the team regularly have songs dedicated to them, such as Slaven Bilić&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Fiery Madness&quot;) which topped Croatian music charts during Euro 2008.
The disruptive behaviour of supporters during matches – in particular those exhibiting ultra-style fandom – has complicated national team affairs. Hooliganism, rioting, vandalism, littering, violence, use of pyrotechnics and discriminatory political expression has led to sanctions both domestically and internationally. The link between the team and national identity generates perennial tension around ethnic nationalism and fascism stemming from the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The football federation, government, and players have made material efforts to prevent unwanted incidents in order to avoid damage to the perception of the team and Croatian people. This has included banning their own fans from certain games. The behaviour of fans has led to penalties and fines for the national team imposed by FIFA and UEFA. The Croatian Football Federation has been assessed significant disciplinary fines and penalties since the early 2000s. In addition to monetary fines, the team has faced tournament point deductions and have had their supporters banned. There have also been multiple acts of protest against the national team, in response to allegations of corruption.

===Charity===
To advance the team&#x27;s charitable efforts manager Slaven Bilić established the &quot;Vatreno Srce&quot; (Fiery Heart) Foundation in 2010. The primary cause of the foundation is helping children. As of 2012, the foundation made fifty donations of 1,200,000 HRK to various children&#x27;s organizations. In December 2012, the foundation made 500,000 HRK on an auction of Niko Kranjčar&#x27;s shirt and Lionel Messi&#x27;s shirt that was signed by all FC Barcelona players. The auction was organized in the Esplanade Zagreb Hotel and attended by President of Croatia Ivo Josipović. In November 2018, the players gathered in The Westin Hotel in Zagreb to answer fans&#x27; phonecalls, the proceeds of which were donated to the Vatreno Srce Foundation. In 2018, the foundation financed Children&#x27;s Hospital Zagreb and &quot;Korak u Život&quot; (A Step Into Life), a charity that helps young children raised in orphanages make the transition into higher education. In November 2019, more than 500,000 HRK was collected in another call event that were then directed to Children&#x27;s Hospital Kantrida. In March 2020, the players collectively donated 4.2 million HRK to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and for repair of damage caused by the 2020 Zagreb earthquake. Members of national team also visit and help children with special needs and their education institutions.

==Stadiums==
The national team has played in thirteen stadiums around the country. The majority of Croatia&#x27;s home matches take place at Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb, the country&#x27;s largest football stadium, which is also the home-ground of local football club Dinamo Zagreb. It was one of two venues for Euro 1976, hosted by Yugoslavia, alongside Red Star Stadium in Belgrade. The Croatian Football Federation previously agreed on extensive plans with the government to renovate the stadium and increase its forty-thousand seating capacity, the proposal was eventually rejected by Mayor of Zagreb Milan Bandić in 2008 due to construction costs.

Home matches are occasionally played at other, smaller venues around the country. Stadion Poljud in Split has hosted some qualifying fixtures since 1995. In the period between 1995 and 2011, Croatia never won a competitive match at Poljud, which the local media dubbed &quot;Poljudsko prokletsvo&quot; (&quot;the Poljud curse&quot;). Qualifying fixtures have also been played at Stadion Kantrida in Rijeka along with Stadion Gradski Vrt in Osijek and Stadion Varteks in Varaždin.

<text>Patricia Hatsue Saiki (&quot;née&quot; Fukuda; born May 28, 1930) is an American politician and former educator from Hilo, Hawaii. She served as a Republican in Congress from 1987 to 1991 and then as Administrator of the Small Business Administration under President of the United States George H. W. Bush.

==Early life==
Saiki was born in Hilo, Hawaii, on May 28, 1930. Saiki graduated from Hilo High School in 1948 and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in 1952. Upon graduating from college, Saiki became a teacher at Punahou, Kaimuki Intermediate, and Kalani High schools. She also taught in Toledo, Ohio, when she and her husband, Stanley Saiki, moved there for his medical school residency.

Saiki ran for office after establishing the teacher&#x27;s chapter of the Hawaii Government Employees Association. Her fellow teachers encouraged her to run for office, which she did in 1968.

==Political career==
In 1968, Saiki joined the Hawai`i Republican Party and ran successfully for a seat in the Hawai`i State House of Representatives. In 1974, she moved to the Hawai`i State Senate where she served her district until 1982. A vacancy was created by U.S. Rep. Cecil Heftel&#x27;s untimely leave from Congress, and on September 20, 1986, a special election was held. Saiki lost the special election (to Democrat Neil Abercrombie) but won a separate election (over Democrat Mufi Hannemann) sending her to Congress where she served two consecutive terms. With her election in 1986, she became the first Republican elected to represent Hawaii in the House of Representatives since its statehood. In 1988, she beat challenger Mary Bitterman, a Democrat and former head of Voice of America.

Until the swearing-in of Charles Djou on May 25, 2010, Saiki was the only Republican to ever hold a House seat from the state of Hawaii and one of only two Republican Members of Congress (the other being Senator Hiram Fong) to represent the state since it gained statehood. She is also the second woman to be elected to Congress from the state of Hawai`i (the first being Patsy Mink, with whom Saiki served for two years).

While in office, Saiki focused on education-related issues. She was a commissioner for the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, and was a member of the Fund for the Improvement of Higher Education. Though fiscally conservative, she also pushed for the redress of Japanese Americans for their internment during World War II.

In 1990, she lost a United States Senate race to Daniel Akaka, but was then appointed Administrator of the Small Business Administration under President George H. W. Bush. In 1994, she lost a race for Governor of Hawaii against Democratic challenger Ben Cayetano. Saiki subsequently chaired the Hawaii Presidential campaign of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and the 2010 and 2012 congressional campaigns of Charles Djou. She served from 2014 to 2015 as chair of the Republican Party of Hawaii.

<text>Beverlee McKinsey (born Beverlee Magruder; August 9, 1935 – May 2, 2008) was an American actress. She is best known for her roles on daytime serials, including Iris Cory Carrington on &quot;Another World&quot; and the spin-off series &quot;Texas&quot; from 1972 to 1981 and Alexandra Spaulding on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1984 to 1992.

==Early life==
McKinsey was born Beverlee Magruder in McAlester, Oklahoma, on August 9, 1935. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Warren S. Magruder of Tulsa. 

McKinsey graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1956 with a degree in drama. She taught in schools in four states before she was married.

==Early Career==
In 1960 McKinsey was host of &quot;Make-Believe Clubhouse&quot;, a Monday - Friday afternoon children&#x27;s program on WGBH-TV in Boston and WENH-TV in Durham, New Hampshire.

She understudied the leading role of newlywed Corie in the original Broadway production of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; and was given the opportunity to perform the role opposite Robert Redford several times. She also co-starred as Honey in the London production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, starring Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill. She started her career in Off-Broadway theater, often appearing alongside James Earl Jones and Doris Belack. Her other work on Broadway included performing in &quot;Mert &amp; Phil&quot; and being an understudy for &quot;Man and Boy&quot;. 

McKinsey moved to Hollywood in the late 1960s, and after several appearances in episodic television shows, she appeared on daytime TV. She played Diana Martin, a reporter, on &quot;Love of Life&quot;, and was then cast in the contract role of Martha Donnelly/Julie Richards (1970–1971) on &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; where she worked with future husband Berkeley Harris.

==Daytime television career==

===Iris Carrington===

After a brief appearance as Emma Frame on &quot;Another World&quot; in May 1972, she so impressed then-head writer Harding Lemay that he subsequently cast her in a drastically different role, from dowdy Emma to that of manipulative, scheming Iris Carrington. McKinsey played the role from December 1972 to July 1980. During much of her tenure on &quot;Another World&quot;, McKinsey&#x27;s portrayal of Iris was part of an unconventional triangle - the character was trying to break up her father Mackenzie Cory and his new wife, Rachel Davis Frame.

McKinsey was made the star of the soap&#x27;s spin-off series, &quot;Texas&quot;, which debuted August 4, 1980. She remains one of three actors on daytime television to be given a star billing on a soap opera, the others being Rosemary Prinz of &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot;, and Dana Andrews of &quot;Bright Promise&quot;. 

After McKinsey left the role of Iris in November 1981, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Texas&quot; eventually lost one million viewers in the Nielsen ratings and was canceled in 1982. 

McKinsey received four Daytime Emmy nominations for her work as Iris.

===Alexandra Spaulding===
After a hiatus from daytime, Gail Kobe, then executive producer of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, lured McKinsey to &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, on CBS, in February 1984 in the newly created character of wealthy matriarch Baroness Alexandra Spaulding Von Halkein.

As Alexandra, McKinsey&#x27;s initial work was portraying Alexandra&#x27;s love for power and the desire to best brother Alan Spaulding, as well as to reclaim the affection, love and approval of Lujack/Nick, her twin sons forcibly taken away from her at birth. Alexandra also cared deeply for her nephews, Phillip and Alan-Michael, but was irritated by Phillip&#x27;s ex-wives, India and Blake. 

While Alexandra could be a snob (and ruthless) at times, she also could let her hair down, as when she went bowling with then-beau H.B. Lewis (Larry Gates). Her ruthlessness was revealed when Alexandra married Roger Thorpe (Michael Zaslow), then subsequently discovered he was involved in an affair with the younger Mindy Lewis. The scene where Alexandra humiliates Roger in public at the Country Club is now considered a &quot;Guiding Light&quot; classic scene.

In 1992, McKinsey took advantage of an out in her contract, and abruptly left GL. Soap journalist Michael Logan wrote about the turn of events:

Interviewing McKinsey was a dream. There were never any &quot;I just love everyone I work with&quot; cliches. After she exited &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, McKinsey cited her &quot;not very pleasant&quot; work environment for one of the reasons she chose to leave the daytime serial. Looking at her contract, she discovered she could leave the show after every six-month period. So McKinsey took advantage of the contract the day before her annual eight-week vacation. McKinsey went on permanent vacation. McKinsey adamantly defended her choice to exit the show. Her bosses felt they had been bamboozled. &quot;They&#x27;re bent out of shape because, for once, somebody beat &#x27;em at their own game,&quot; she said. &quot;I had warned Jill (the show&#x27;s then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps) – although I don&#x27;t think she paid attention to me – that I was not happy. I was not happy with the story line.&quot; She had confided in Phelps previously that she was frustrated enough to quit, and was told in response that perhaps she should read her contract.

McKinsey later quipped that perhaps it was Phelps and the rest of the Guiding Light production team who should have read the contract. &quot;They didn&#x27;t read the contract! I read it very closely. I knew every word. The next day, they were all combing over the contract. Somebody said, &#x27;Maybe Beverlee&#x27;s not familiar with the contract.&#x27; Well, of course she was! She wrote it, you bozos. She wrote it! I&#x27;ve had this out clause since 1986. I asked for it and it was P&amp;G that determined how much notice they wanted me to give – and they chose eight weeks.&quot;

In addition to her issues with storytelling, which she said would not have motivated her to leave if her working environment had been happier, McKinsey noted that acting had simply stopped being fun for her. &quot;The hours just made me crazy. They were too long,&quot; she explained.

==Personal life==

She was married three times, and had one son, Scott McKinsey from her marriage to Mark McKinsey. Her son is a director on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; (on which she briefly appeared in 1994). 

After being married to Angus Duncan, McKinsey married Berkeley Harris, a co-star from &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;, in 1971, and cared for him during his illness from terminal brain cancer prior to his death in 1984. 

In 1994, she made a brief appearance as Myrna Slaughter on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In an interview, she said she took the role to qualify for her medical insurance, but otherwise adamantly considered herself retired from soaps from that moment in 1992 when she last left the set of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She had resisted all entreaties to return to daytime television. After some health issues, including a kidney transplant, McKinsey retired to Southern California and made few public appearances. Michael Logan famously described McKinsey as &quot;[making] Greta Garbo look like a chatterbox!&quot;. Logan, &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; soap columnist, once called McKinsey &quot;…the greatest actress ever to grace daytime drama.&quot;

==Death==
Beverlee McKinsey died on May 2, 2008, at the Olympic Medical Center in Los Angeles, from complications due to a kidney transplant, which she had undergone in 1998.

<doc id="715263" wikidata="Q3938313" url="?curid=715263" title="Robert Hiltzik">
<text>Robert Hiltzik (born ) is an American director and writer. He is writer and director of the 1983 summer camp slasher film, &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot;, which attracted a cult following.

Hiltzik graduated from Williams College and continued to NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts for film and then attended Hofstra University Law School. He now works as a partner in a New York City law firm.

Hiltzik did not know that his film had gained such a devoted following over the years, until he was contacted in March 2000 by Sleepawaycampmovies.com&#x27;s Jeff Hayes, who arranged for him to record a commentary for the film&#x27;s Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD. After a number of sequels directed and written by others, Hiltzik returned to write and direct a 2003 sequel, &quot;Return to Sleepaway Camp&quot;. He decided that this newest chapter would ignore the storylines of the other sequels, saying that he wanted to pick up where the original film had ended. The production was stopped for some time (according to Fangoria.com, the digital effects were being redone) before being released in 2008 as a direct-to-video sequel. Hiltzik has directed no other films.

<text>The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is the administrative and controlling body for association football, beach soccer, and futsal in Africa. It was established on 8 February 1957 at the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; in Khartoum, Sudan by the national football associations of: Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Africa. With a membership of 54 Member Associations, the secretariat is based in Egypt.

Representing the African confederation of FIFA, CAF organizes runs and regulates national team and club continental competitions annually or biennially such as the Africa Cup of Nations and Women&#x27;s Africa Cup of Nations, which they control the prize money and broadcast rights to. CAF will be allocated 9 spots at the FIFA World Cup starting from 2026 and could have an opportunity of 10 spots with the addition of an intercontinental play-off tournament involving 6 teams to decide the last 2 FIFA World Cup places (46+2).

The main headquarters of CAF was first situated within the offices of the Sudanese Football Association in Khartoum until it experienced a fire outbreak and then moved to a town near Cairo, Egypt until 2002. Youssef Mohamad was the first general secretary and Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem, the first president. President Patrice Motsepe from South Africa was elected on 12 March 2021 in an unopposed elections held in Rabat, Morocco.

===International===
Shortly after formation, CAF organized the Africa Cup of Nations (abbreviated AFCON) in 1957 and it has since become its flagship competition. Faced with undisclosed decline in popularity of local competitions and the mass exodus of homegrown footballers to Europe, Asia and the Americas in the 1990s and early 2000s, CAF launched the African Nations Championship (alternatively, though not widely used, the Championship of African Nations (CHAN)) on 11 September 2007 and began organization two years later, to address this issue. CAF also organizes qualification tournaments/competitions for the FIFA U-20 World Cup and the FIFA U-17 World Cup for its member associations; both of which initially began on a home-and-away two-legged basis but has since 1995 been organized in appointed host countries as respectively the Under-20 and U-17 Africa Cup of Nations.

For women&#x27;s football operates competitions which currently serve as qualification tournaments for the related FIFA-organized tournaments which launched at the exact same year they began formation. The flagship African women&#x27;s football competition/tournament is the Women&#x27;s Africa Cup of Nations, which launched in 1991 as the &quot;African Women&#x27;s Championship&quot; and was known in the mass media between 2015 and 2021 as the &quot;Africa/African Women/Women&#x27;s Cup of Nations&quot;, which currently qualifies 4 teams to the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. CAF also organizes qualification matches for &quot;promising future female footballers&quot; at both the Under-20 and Under-17 levels, launched in 2002 and 2008 respectively, both of which crowns no champions but instead qualifies 2 teams to compete at the FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup and the FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup respectively.

===Club===
For African clubs, CAF runs the CAF Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Champions League, the CAF Confederation Cup, the CAF Super Cup and the African Schools Football Championship for both males and females. First held in 1964 as the &quot;African Cup of Champions Clubs&quot; (simply known sometimes as the African Cup) and rebranded in 1997 as the CAF Champions League, this &quot;prestigious&quot; football club competition currently features the champions of top-division leagues of CAF member associations and the runners-up teams of the league classifications of member associations the top 12 ranked national associations as documented by the CAF 5-year ranking system.

A currently-former competition, the African Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, commenced in 1975 for national cup winners of member associations and a third currently-former competition, the CAF Cup, launched in 1992 for African teams who finished below the top 2 positions of the league classifications of member associations and haven&#x27;t met any criteria for qualification to any CAF competition. CAF decided to merge these two competitions together to form the current second-tier CAF Confederation Cup in 2004, and it currently incorporates the participation of national cup winners from the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, whiles maintaining the format of the participation of teams who finished 3rd in the top-division league classifications of the 12 highest-ranked member associations as documented by the CAF 5-Year Ranking system from the CAF Cup. It is also ranked below the CAF Champions League.

The winners of the CAF Champions League play the winners of the African Cup Winners&#x27; Cup until 2004 and the CAF Confederation Cup thereafter in the CAF Super Cup which was launched in 1993.

The Afro-Asian Club Championship was an annual football match jointly organized between CAF and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) between the winners of the CAF Champions League and the winners of the AFC Champions League between 1987 and 1999.

The CAF Women&#x27;s Champions League was announced and approved on 30 June 2020, launched on 12 September that year and began contesting the following year, i.e. 2021. It features women&#x27;s national league and cup winners nvolving the champions of CAF&#x27;s sub-confederation qualification tournaments for women&#x27;s club teams.

==Sponsorship==
In October 2004, South African telecommunications giant, MTN, contracted a 4-year deal to sponsor CAF competitions worth US$12.5 million, which was the biggest sponsorship deal in African sporting history at that time.

CAF opened new sponsorship callouts when MTN&#x27;s contract expired and French telecommunications giant Orange scooped it up in July 2009, signing an 8-year comprehensive long-term undisclosed deal to sponsor CAF competitions with a value of €100 million.

On 21 July 2016, French energy and petroleum giant, Total S.A., replaced Orange as the main sponsor with an 8-year sponsorship package from CAF for a value of €950 million to support its competitions. Total rebranded as TotalEnergies on 28 May 2021.

<text>The Northern Belle was an American transatlantic ship which ran aground near Thanet, England, on 5 January 1857. No lives on her were lost, thanks to heroic rescue efforts, in blizzard conditions. However, another ship sank, en route to the scene, the Margate lugger &quot;Victory&quot; which was lost along with her crew.

The &quot;Belle&quot; was constructed in 1853, under the ownership of J. P. Whitney and Co. of New Orleans. Her common routes were New Orleans to Liverpool and Le Havre, carrying wheat on the outbound run. A barque of 1,150 tons burden with a crew of 23, she was on a voyage from New York to London, with a cargo of wheat, flour, and linseed cake, when as a result of an unusually heavy gale had to put into Kingsgate, Kent. She anchored 3/4 of a mile from the shore, however by 6 am she was riding heavily, the sea occasionally breaking completely over her. The storm was so ferocious that the main and mizzen masts were cut away by the crew at 6.30am. The Margate lugger &quot;Victory&quot;, along with the &quot;Ocean&quot;, and the &quot;Eclipse&quot; attempted a rescue and possible salvage. The &quot;Victory&quot; was lost along with her crew at 11.30 am. The storm raged all day and local lifeboats were not able to launch. The &quot;Belle&quot; parted from her anchors at midnight, and was driven onto the rocks beneath nearby cliffs, at Foreness Point. The crew lashed themselves to the one remaining mast and were spotted from the beach at dawn. Two lifeboats, the &quot;Mary White&quot; and the &quot;Culmer White&quot;, made three trips to rescue them. The lifeboats and crew were from Broadstairs and Margate. The &quot;Mary White&quot; had to be hauled and dragged two miles over fields of snow to bring it to a place from which it could be launched. Captain Tate and his crew from the &quot;Northern Belle&quot; were all saved.
On 15 January 1857 (Thursday) the &quot;Illustrated Times of London&quot; advertised that they would print five engravings of the tragedy and portraits of the crew the following Saturday.

It was reported on 22 January, in a letter to the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, that the ship and cargo were still on the reef, in good condition, and were salvageable.

News of the disaster was broadcast world-wide, as far as the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; who picked up the story from the &quot;New York Times&quot;. A benefit by &quot;gentlemen amateurs&quot; was held at the St James&#x27;s Theatre, in London, on 7 February.

On 23 February 1857 3,340 barrels of damaged American flour, part of the cargo, was auctioned off at the New Corn Exchange Coffee House, Mark Lane, London. On 2 March, another 450 barrels of damaged American flour and 20 barrels of damaged linseed cake was auctioned at the coffee house.
&quot;The Times&quot; reported on 5 March that the vessel was a shipping hazard and all her cargo had been salvaged except forty to fifty logs of mahogany. It was thought that only two barrels of dynamite would be required to destroy the wreck. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; pointed out on 9 March 1857 that the wreck in foggy weather was an obstacle to navigation, &quot;A few days ago a ship had a narrow escape by striking it.&quot;

In April 1857, the U.S. president Franklin Pierce had 21 silver medals struck and issued an award of £270 sterling for sharing amongst the rescuers, £10–£30 per man.

The London &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; of 9 October 1857 reported that the wreck was to be raised, and that chains had been fitted with a view of floating her with the aid of buoys at the next spring tides. Some Whitstable people had bought the hull for £260.

Attempts to raise the &quot;Belle&quot; on 21 November 1857 were unsuccessful despite successfully raising the stern out of the water with the help of four pontoons. One of the chains around the hull broke during the process, aborting the attempt. The masts disappeared from view in early December, and a green buoy marked &quot;Wreck&quot; was put in place 10 fathoms eastward from the stern.

In June 1858 Canterbury Town Council, put on display a piece of the wreck taken from the recently raised hull, which was completely riddled with Teredo worm.

A Margate beer shop was named the Northern Belle in 1858.
==Legacy==
The tragedy inspired several literary works including novels and poetry. Charles Mackay published a poem &quot;Northern Belle – a tribute to the brave&quot;, in February 1857. Edwin Arnold wrote &quot;The Wreck of the Northern Belle&quot; with the proceeds to go to representatives of the &quot;Victory&quot; crew.

<doc id="715270" wikidata="Q474737" url="?curid=715270" title="Car-free movement">
<text>The car-free movement is a social movement centering the belief that large and/or high-speed motorized vehicles (cars, trucks, tractor units, motorcycles, etc.) are too dominant in modern life, particularly in urban areas such as cities and suburbs. It is a broad, informal, emergent network of individuals and organizations, including social activists, urban planners, transportation engineers, environmentalists and others. The goal of the movement is to establish places where motorized vehicle use is greatly reduced or eliminated, by converting road and parking space to other public uses and rebuilding compact urban environments where most destinations are within easy reach by other means, including walking, cycling, public transport, personal transporters, and mobility as a service.

== Context ==
Before the twentieth century, cities and towns were usually compact, containing narrow streets busy with human activity. In the early twentieth century, many of these settlements were adapted to accommodate the car with wider roads, more car parking spaces, and lower population densities, with space between urban buildings reserved for automotive use. Lower population densities caused urban sprawl with longer distances between locations. This also brought traffic congestion which made older transport methods unattractive or impractical, and created the conditions for more traffic and sprawl; the car system was &quot;increasingly able to &#x27;drive&#x27; out competitors, such as feet, bikes, buses and trains&quot;. This process led to changes in urban form and living patterns that offered little opportunity for people without a car.

Some governments have responded with policies and regulations aimed at reversing auto dependency by increasing urban densities, encouraging mixed use development and infill, reducing space allocated to private cars, increasing walkability, supporting cycling and other alternative vehicles similar in size and speed, and public transport. Globally, urban planning is evolving in an effort to increase public transport and non-motorized transport modal shares and shift away from private transport oriented development. Cities like Hong Kong developed a highly integrated public transportation system which effectively reduced the use of private transport. In contrast with private automotive travel, car sharing, where people can easily rent a car for a few hours rather than own one, is emerging as an increasingly important element for urban transportation.

==Urban design==
Proponents of the car-free movement focus on both sustainable and public transport (bus, tram, etc.) options and on urban design, zoning, school placement policies, urban agriculture, remote work options, and housing developments that create proximity or access so that long-distance transportation becomes less of a requirement of daily life.

New urbanism is an American urban design movement that arose in the early 1980s. Its goal has been to reform all aspects of real estate development and urban planning, from urban retrofits to suburban infill. New urbanist neighborhoods are designed to contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, and to be walkable. Other, more auto-oriented cities are also making incremental changes to provide transportation alternatives through Complete streets improvements.

&quot;World Squares for all&quot; is a scheme to remove much of the traffic from major squares in London, including Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.

Car-free cities are, as the name implies, entire cities (or at least the inner parts thereof) which have been made entirely car-free.

Car-free zones are areas of a city or town where the use of cars is prohibited or greatly restricted.

To make the car-free zones/cities, (movable and/or stationary) traffic bollards and other barriers are often used to deny car access.

Living streets and complete streets prioritize the needs of users of the street as a whole over those of car drivers. They are designed to be shared by pedestrians, playing children, bicyclists, and low-speed motor vehicles.
Distribution centers allow easy restocking of supermarkets, outlet stores, restaurants, and more in city centers. They rely on tractor units to unload their cargo in the suburban distribution center. 
The products are then placed in a small truck (sometimes electrically powered), cargo bike, or other vehicle to bridge the last mile to the destination in the city center. Besides offering advantages to the population (increased safety due to truck drivers having less blind spots, reduced noise pollution and traffic, reduced tailpipe emissions and reduced air pollution, and more), it also offers financial advantage for the companies, as tractor units require a lot of time to bridge this last mile (they lack agility and consume much fuel in congested streets).

The method above however still does not reduce car use inside non-car-free city centers (customers often use cars to fetch their groceries or appliances from city stores, since they have so much storage space). This problem is solved by means of online food ordering systems, which allow customers to order online, and then have it delivered to their doorstep by the supermarket or store itself, through bicycle couriers (using cargo bikes), electric delivery robots and delivery vans. Delivery vans allow to take along more cargo and deliver to several customers on a same trip. These food ordering systems could provide for a smooth transition for those cities that wish to become car-free as it can reduce both personal car use and personal car demand in cities.

At the outskirts of towns, between the exits of the rings roads, and the car-free zones in the city center themselves, additional car parking lots can be added, generally in the form of underground car parks (to avoid it taking up surface space). Careful placement of these car-parking lots is needed though, ensuring that they are made far enough from the city centers (and closer to the ring roads) to avoid them attracting more cars to the city center. In some instances, near these car parking lots, Park and ride public transport (i.e. bus) stops are foreseen, or bicycle-sharing systems are present.

Community bicycle programs provide bicycles within an urban environment for short term use. The first successful scheme was in the 1960s in Amsterdam and can now be found in many other cities with 20,000 bicycles introduced to Paris in 2007 in the Vélib&#x27; scheme. Dockless bike share systems have recently appeared in the United States and provide more convenience for people wanting to rent a bike for a short time period.

==Advocacy groups==
The Campaign for Better Transport (formerly known as Transport2000) was formed in 1972 in Britain to challenge proposed cuts in the British rail network and since then has promoted public transport.

Car Free Walks is a UK-based website encouraging walkers to use public transport to reach the start and end of walks, rather than using a car.

==Activism groups==
Road protests in the United Kingdom rose to prominence in the early 1990s in response to a major road building program both in urban communities and also rural areas.

Reclaim the Streets, a movement formed in 1991 in London, &quot;invaded&quot; major roads, highway or freeway to stage parties. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space.

In Flanders, the organization Fietsersbond has called upon the government to ban tractor units in city centers.

Critical Mass rides emerged in 1992 in San Francisco where cyclists take to the streets en masse to dominate the traffic, using the slogan &quot;we are traffic.&quot; The ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists. The movement has grown to include events in major metropolitan cities around the world.

The World Naked Bike Ride was born in 2001 in Spain with the first naked bike rides, which then emerged as the WNBR in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many different activist groups and individuals around the world to promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, walkable communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable living.

Parking Days started in 2005 when REBAR, a collaborative group of creators, designers and activists based in San Francisco, transformed a metered parking spot into a small park complete with turf, seating, and shade and by 2007 there were 180 parks in 27 cities around the world.

==Official events==
Car Free Days are official events with the common goal of taking a fair number of cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day, in order to give the people who live and work there a chance to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars. The first events were organized in Reykjavík (Iceland), Bath (UK) and La Rochelle (France) in 1995. Jakarta, Indonesia is one such city that hosts weekly Car-Free days.

Ciclovía is a similar event in many cities that places a large emphasis on cycling as an alternative to auto travel. The event originated in Bogotá, Colombia in 1974. Now, Bogotá holds weekly ciclovías that turn the streets into giant car-free celebrations complete with stages set up in city parks with aerobics instructors, yoga teachers, and musicians leading people through various performances. The event has inspired similar celebrations globally.

&quot;In town, without my car!&quot; is an EU campaign and day every autumn (Northern Hemisphere) for an increased use of vehicles other than the car. It has since spread beyond the EU, and in 2004 more than 40 countries participated.

World Urbanism Day was founded in 1949 in Buenos Aires and is celebrated in more than 30 countries on four continents each November 8.

&quot;Towards Car-free Cities&quot; is the annual conference of the World Car-free Network and provides a focal point for diverse aspects of the emerging global car-free movement. The conference has been held in major cities around the world, including Portland, Oregon, United States in 2008 (its first time in North America), and has also been in Istanbul, Turkey; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Berlin, Germany; Prague, Czech Republic; Timișoara, Romania; and Lyon, France. The conference series attempts to bridge the gap between many of the diverse people and organizations interested in reducing urban dependence on the automobile.

Transportation Alternatives&#x27; &quot;Annual Commuter Race&quot; pits a bicyclist against both a subway rider and a cab rider in a race from Queens to Manhattan. The Fifth Annual Commuter race took place in May 2009, where bicyclist Rachel Myers beat straphanger Dan Hendrick and cab rider Willie Thompson to make it the fifth year the contestant on the bicycle won. Myers took the 2009 title with a time of 20 minutes and 15 seconds to make the 4.2 mile trek from Sunnyside, Queens to Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Hendrick showed up 15 minutes later off the subway and Thompson arrived via cab nearly a half-hour after that. Transportation Alternatives is a group that &quot;seeks to change New York City&#x27;s transportation priorities to encourage and increase non-polluting, quiet, city-friendly travel and decrease—not ban—private car use. [They] seek a rational transportation system based on a &#x27;Green Transportation Hierarchy,&#x27; which gives preference to modes of travel based on their benefits and costs to society. To achieve its goals, T.A. works in five areas: Bicycling, Walking and Traffic Calming, Car-Free Parks, Safe Streets and Sensible Transportation.&quot; The 2009 Commuter Race came on the heels of a Times Square traffic ban in NYC that drew national media attention.

==Car-free development==

===Definitions and types===

There are many areas of the world where people have always lived without cars, because no road access is possible, or none has been provided. In developed countries these include islands and some historic neighborhoods or settlements, the largest example being the canal city of Venice. The term carfree &quot;development&quot; implies a physical change – either new building or changes to an existing built area.

Melia &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) define car-free development as follows:

Car-free developments are residential or mixed use developments which:

* Normally provide a traffic-free immediate environment, and:
* Offer no parking or limited parking separated from the residence, and:
* Are designed to enable residents to live without owning a car.

This definition (which they distinguish from the more common &quot;low car development&quot;) is based mainly on experience in Northwestern Europe, where the movement for car-free development began. Within this definition three types are identified:

* Vauban model
* Limited Access model
* Pedestrian zones with residential population

====Vauban====

Vauban, Freiburg, Germany is according to this definition, the largest car-free development in Europe, with over 5,000 residents. Whether it can be considered car-free is open to debate: many local people prefer the term &quot;&quot; – literally &quot;free from parking spaces&quot; to describe the traffic management system there. Vehicles are allowed down the residential streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are frequent infractions. Residents of the stellplatzfrei areas must sign an annual declaration stating whether they own a car or not. Car owners must purchase a place in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery, run by a council-owned company. The cost of these spaces – €17,500 in 2006, plus a monthly fee – acts as a disincentive to car ownership.

====Limited access type====

The more common form of car free development involves some sort of physical barrier, which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a car-free center. 
Melia &quot;et al.&quot; describe this as the &quot;Limited Access&quot; type. 
In some cases such as Stellwerk 60 in Cologne, there is a removable barrier, controlled by a residents&#x27; organizations. In others cases, such as in Waterwijk, vehicular access is only available from the exterior.

====Pedestrian zones====
Whereas the first two models apply to newly built car free developments, most pedestrianized areas have been retro-fitted. Pedestrian zones may be considered car-free developments where they include a significant population and a low rate of vehicle ownership per household. The largest example in Europe is Groningen, Netherlands which had a city centre population of 16,500 in 2008.

=== Benefits and problems ===
Several studies have been done on European car free developments. The most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by Jan Scheurer. Other more recent studies have been made of specific car-free areas such as Vienna&#x27;s Floridsdorf car-free development.

The main benefits found for car free developments (summarized in Melia &quot;et al.&quot; 2010) found in the various studies are:

* very low levels of car use, resulting in much less traffic on surrounding roads
* high rates of walking and cycling
* more independent movement and active play amongst children
* less land taken for parking and roads – more available for green or social space

The main problems are related to parking management - if parking is not controlled in the surrounding area, there are often complaints from neighbors about overspill parking.

<text>William Donald MacLaughlin (November 24, 1906 – May 28, 1986) was an American actor. The son of a doctor, MacLaughlin was born November 24, 1906, in Webster, Iowa. He studied speech and English at Iowa Wesleyan University, Northwestern University, and the University of Arizona.

==Early years==
MacLaughlin&#x27;s family contained &quot;a long line of ministers&quot;, and he planned to study for the ministry when he entered college.

== Television ==
MacLaughlin originated the role of lawyer Chris Hughes on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1956, and played the role until his death in 1986. Contract negotiations kept him (and his on-screen wife Helen Wagner) off the soap for most of the early 1980s, but the show finally welcomed the two back in a big storyline with heavy uses of past clips from the show. In the story, Chris and his wife Nancy were celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. In real life, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was celebrating its thirtieth anniversary on the air. 

MacLaughlin was also a member of the Gang Busters.

== Radio ==
Prior to TV, MacLaughlin was active on radio, beginning in 1933. He starred as the title character on radio&#x27;s &quot;David Harding, Counterspy&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, he joined the cast of &quot;The Romance of Helen Trent&quot;, in the role of Dwight Swanson, &quot;a rancher who becomes interested in Helen Trent.&quot; MacLaughlin&#x27;s other roles on radio included those listed in the table below.
He was also in the cast of &quot;Buck Private and His Girl&quot;.

== Stage ==
MacLaughlin appeared in a 1948 Broadway production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play, &quot;The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden&quot; and in &quot;Virginia Reel&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Fifth Column&quot; (1940).

== Personal life ==
MacLaughlin married Mary Prugh, a newspaperwoman. They had three children.

== Death ==
After a brief illness, Maclaughlin died on May 28, 1986, at his daughter&#x27;s home in Goshen, Connecticut, and is buried in Dover, Vermont.

<text>Metamorpho (Rex Mason) is a fictional superhero character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created in 1965 by writer Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon. He is a founding member of the Outsiders, and has also joined multiple incarnations of the Justice League. The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved. 

Anthony Carrigan is set to portray the character in the DC Universe (DCU), beginning with the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025).

==Creation==

Fradon spoke on the character&#x27;s genesis stating, 

==Publication history==
Metamorpho&#x27;s creator, Bob Haney, had seen success with DC Comics in 1964 with the titles &quot;Metal Men&quot; and &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of George Kashdan, Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles&#x27; popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #57 (January 1965).

As first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s. Artist Ramona Fradon was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho&#x27;s first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho&#x27;s appearances in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; led to a 17-issue ongoing series between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared in two issues of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (#42 and #44), but did not join the eponymous group and became a reserve member.

Metamorpho appears on the cover of &quot;Aquaman&quot; #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the &quot;Sea King&#x27;s Funeral&quot;. Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #413–418 and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #218–220 and #229.

In 1975, Metamorpho appeared in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho&#x27;s creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 San Diego Comic-Con, and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they&#x27;d most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together. Fradon later commented: &quot;I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby. I never had an experience like I had working with Bob Haney on &quot;Metamorpho&quot;. It was like our minds were in perfect synch ... it was one of those wonderful collaborations that doesn&#x27;t happen very often&quot;.

After becoming a charter member of the Outsiders in 1983, and member of the European branch of the Justice League International, Metamorpho received his own four-issue mini-series in 1993. In 2005, DC Comics reprinted Metamorpho&#x27;s early &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; appearances and the entirety of the 1965 series as one of the company&#x27;s volumes of &quot;Showcase Presents&quot;. In 2007, Dan Jurgens launched the six-issue series &quot;Metamorpho: Year One&quot;.

As part of &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot;, Neil Gaiman wrote a 12-page Metamorpho story that Mike Allred illustrated. In 2016, Metamorpho starred in the anthology series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; alongside Firestorm, Sugar and Spike, and the Metal Men.

In 2024, Metamorpho received a new ongoing series, &quot;Metamorpho: The Element Man&quot;, as part of the DC All In initiative. It is written by Al Ewing and illustrated by Steve Lieber.

==Fictional character biography==
Rex Mason is an adventurer who is hired by Stagg Enterprises CEO Simon Stagg to retrieve an Egyptian artifact, the Orb of Ra. Shortly after hiring him, Simon Stagg learns that Mason has been dating his daughter Sapphire Stagg. This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him.

In an Egyptian pyramid, Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon&#x27;s brutish bodyguard Java and is eventually exposed to a radioactive meteorite from which the Orb of Ra was fashioned, transforming him into Metamorpho, the Element Man. After transforming Metamorpho, the Orb proves harmful to him, and Stagg uses it to threaten him into compliance. Later, it is revealed that Ra created Metamorpho and similar beings to help him battle Apep.

Metamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, does not possess a fully human appearance. As such, he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, rejecting an offer of membership from the Justice League in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #42 because of this. Green Lantern attempts to change him back using his power ring, but is stopped by a &quot;yellow&quot; component of the meteorite radiation.

Metamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania &quot;Rainie&quot; Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself Element Girl (nicknamed &quot;the Chemical Doll&quot;) and works with him on a number of cases.

Issues #16–17 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is framed. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho&#x27;s colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed.

Element Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister&#x27;s murder was engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an insectoid villain. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued.

Metamorpho reappears years later in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #101 (April–May 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this &quot;cure&quot; early because he needs Mason to save Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of the last two issues of his previous series.

Urania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamorpho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell&#x27;s powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman,&quot; involves Death of the Endless. Death mentions Algon&#x27;s death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever.

===Outsiders===
Metamorpho spends some time working with the Outsiders. While in the despotically ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and disassembled. The tyrant&#x27;s forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by Katana&#x27;s indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders&#x27; plane is shot down by the Bad Samaritan. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, too far away from land to rescue themselves.

In &quot;Millennium&quot;, Helga Jace betrays the Outsiders and kills Metamorpho. He is later resurrected in &quot;Invasion!&quot; when the Dominators&#x27; gene bomb detonates.

===Justice League===
Metamorpho spends some time with the Justice League, including Justice League Europe. During this period, he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the Metal Men, who have been tricked by Simon Stagg. His League friends, Rocket Red and Animal Man, are at the site of the battle, but are being detained by Java. After the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire, but the baby boy&#x27;s touch harms all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java holds the baby, his arms melt. Metamorpho hands the baby over to Simon, who immediately fears he will be affected like Java was moments before and die. However, something in his genetic structure protects him, just as it did with Sapphire. Simon&#x27;s stance softens and everyone is set free. Doc Magnus, the leader of the Metal Men, offers his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho&#x27;s friends are puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he hoped the baby would kill Simon.

Later, Metamorpho has a romantic relationship with Crimson Fox, which is cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He later reforms his body with a new appearance.

===Third death and return===
In &quot;JLA&quot; #1, Metamorpho sacrifices himself to rescue Nuklon, Obsidian, and Icemaiden from the destruction of the Justice League satellite. He is temporarily resurrected by the Cathexis and permanently resurrected by Sapphire Stagg using the Orb of Ra.

Shortly thereafter, an accident with one of Simon Stagg&#x27;s experiments turns Simon, Sapphire, and Joey into an energy being, and causes Metamorpho to take on the form and personality of Java. &quot;Java&quot; kidnaps Black Canary, asking for her help in rescuing the others. With Canary&#x27;s help, he becomes Metamorpho again and returns the others to their normal forms.

===Outsiders===
At the same time, Metamorpho has seemingly been appearing in the &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) series, but Rex Mason informs the team that their &quot;Metamorpho&quot; is a regrown fragment of his own body.

Metamorpho continues to serve on the Outsiders when Batman takes over, and after its further restructuring following Batman&#x27;s apparent death. He is apparently killed yet again alongside the rest of the team in a satellite explosion orchestrated by Talia al Ghul.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. One story reveals that the Outsiders are revealed to have survived. It is stated that Metamorpho was able to save the team by the same technique he previously used to rescue the Justice League during Hyperclan&#x27;s attack. He is also shown as one of the candidates for the new Justice League International, but is ultimately not chosen.

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Metamorpho is featured on the news as an apparent example of the &quot;Superman Theory&quot;, in which the government is thought to have been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.

In &quot;The Terrifics&quot;, Metamorpho is a member of the eponymous team, consisting of himself, Mister Terrific, and Plastic Man. They travel into the Dark Multiverse and discover Phantom Girl, who is trapped in her intangible form. Metamorpho is temporarily returned to his human form, but chooses to be transformed again and becomes Stagg Industries&#x27; chief security officer.

==Powers and abilities==
Metamorpho can transmute his body into a wide variety of elemental compounds and form them at will. Originally, he was limited to elements that were naturally found in the human body. Somehow, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can stretch, bounce, elongate, and reform himself like rubber or plastic. Rex is able to alter the consistences of these chemical elements and combines them into complex compounds. Metamorpho could reshape parts or the whole of his body. Rex&#x27;s body provides him with natural armor, offering damage resistance from blunt and energy attacks. He is also a skilled martial artist, archaeologist, and detective.

<doc id="715291" wikidata="Q3249622" url="?curid=715291" title="Greater Iqbal Park">
<text>Greater Iqbal Park (Punjabi, ), formerly Iqbal Park (after poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal) and Minto Park, is an urban park located on the outskirts of the Walled City in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.

Noted as the home of Minar-e-Pakistan&quot;,&quot; the 329-acre park includes an artificial lake which spreads over four acres which includes an 800-feet-long musical fountain. Other attractions includes a two-kilometre-long soft rail, a library, an open-air gym and a food court. The tombs of Allama Iqbal and Hafeez Jalandhari are also located in the park.

== History ==
The grounds known as Greater Iqbal Park today were used for ceremonial military parades during the Mughal era. After the ascension of the Sikhs into power in 1799, the grounds came to be known as &#x27;Parade Ground&#x27;, as the area continued to be used for the same purpose as it was by the Mughals.

When the British captured Lahore in 1849, they renamed the grounds as Minto Park, after Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto, and Governor-General of India between July 1807 and 1813.

After the creation of Pakistan, the park was renamed as Iqbal Park, after the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, in commemoration of the Lahore Resolution of 1940. After extensive renovations were completed in December 2016, the park was given its current name.

== Renovation and expansion ==
Work began on the upgradation of the park on 10 October 2015. Habib Construction Services Limited was contracted to complete the project. Along with renovation of the Minar-i-Pakistan, the project featured expansion of the Iqbal Park by including it in the stretch of Circular Road between the park and Lahore Fort.
The 125-acre green oasis is surrounded almost entirely by the old city of Lahore. The project was completed on 9 November 2016 incurring a total cost of PKR 981 million as quoted by the contractor of the project.
The new-look park was formally inaugurated on 17 December 2016.

Furthermore, the National History Museum was opened in the park in 2018. It is the first digital museum in Pakistan that offers an immersive experience to visitors with the help of cutting-edge technologies. Using holograms and virtual reality equipment, this digital museum commemorates all the historic events leading to the emergence of Pakistan in 1947. Along with hosting a vast collection of national relics and antiquities, the museum also highlights the key sports and cultural events throughout the history of the country.

== Features ==
The park features the following sites:

* Minar-e-Pakistan
* Tomb of Hafeez Jalandhari
* Tomb of Allama Iqbal
* Musical fountain
* National History Museum
* Library
* Boating lake
* Mughal-style baradari
* Children play area
* Food court
* Open-air gym
* Walking trails
* Buggy track
* Gazebos

<doc id="715296" wikidata="Q6375088" url="?curid=715296" title="Katana (DC Comics)">
<text>Katana () is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. First appearing in 1983, Katana is a samurai warrior whose skill with a sword allows her to fight for justice as a superheroine. Her tragic backstory includes the death of her husband, Maseo, whose soul becomes trapped in her blade, the Soultaker.

Katana has been part of various DC Comics superhero teams, including the Justice League and Birds of Prey, but is most commonly associated with the Outsiders, a team of heroes hand-picked by Batman to act as his personal black ops team, handling riskier missions. Of the character&#x27;s first appearances, one critic has noted, &quot;The idea that a superhero would wield a sword which caught the souls of the wielder’s victims was not very superhero-y. But Katana was from the start a rough and tumble character happy to use throwing stars as weapons (even if she usually used the flat of her sword otherwise).&quot;

In the 2010s, DC began to feature the character much more extensively in media adaptations of its comic books, including a recurring role in the animated series &quot;&quot; and a starring role in the series &quot;Beware the Batman&quot;. The character was portrayed by Rila Fukushima in the Arrowverse TV series &quot;Arrow&quot; and by Karen Fukuhara in the 2016 DC Extended Universe film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. Katana has also been featured in direct-to-video animated films and a number of DC Comics video games.

==Creation==
Barr spoke on the character&#x27;s genesis during an interview stating,When we created Batman and the Outsiders, we brought in, of course, Black Lightning and Metamorpho, who were pre-existing characters, which we thought would give the series some sort of gravitas and a sense of existing in the DC Universe. Then we needed three new characters, and so far, none of the characters we&#x27;d picked for the Outsiders had been women, so I decided that there would be an almost mini-Batman-and-Robin team, Katana and Halo. I&#x27;d always been interested in Japanese culture and samurai, so I decided that the character of Katana would be a female samurai.

==Publication history==
Katana first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #200 (cover-dated July 1983) and was created by writer Mike W. Barr and artist Jim Aparo. She is frequently a member of &quot;team&quot; publications such as &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (during the New 52 era), and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (during the DC Rebirth era).

In February 2013, Katana received her own series as part of The New 52, written by Ann Nocenti and with art by Alex Sanchez. &quot;Katana&quot; lasted for ten issues, with the final issue being released on December 11, 2013.

==Fictional character biography==
===Becoming Katana===
 is an average Japanese girl, save for her proficiency in the martial arts, a trait encouraged by her parents. Two brothers—Maseo and Takeo Yamashiro (from whom she gained her current surname)—both proclaim their love for her. While she likes both, she chooses Maseo as her husband. Enraged, Takeo refuses to attend the couple&#x27;s wedding. Maseo disowns his brother, who joined the yakuza and took their mark of a dragon tattoo across his chest. Tatsu and Maseo, mourning the deaths of Tatsu&#x27;s parents, start a family of their own. Tatsu gives birth to twins, Yuki and Reiko. Meanwhile, Takeo rises through the yakuza ranks and indulges his &quot;exotic tastes&quot; for ancient weapons. He is presented with twin swords by General Karnz (later henchman to Baron Bedlam), one of which Takeo favors for its mystical properties.

Takeo spends days preparing himself before taking both swords to the Yamashiro residence, demanding his brother to duel for the &quot;prize&quot; of Tatsu. During the course of the struggle, a fire is started, and—while Maseo is distracted by his children—Takeo kills his brother with the sword that later becomes known as &quot;Soultaker&quot;. Tatsu arises just in time to see her husband die and engage Takeo, gaining the upper hand and disarming him. Attempting to save her children, she hears her husband&#x27;s voice coming from the sword, telling her they are already lost. Escaping with her life, Tatsu begins training as a samurai under a master called Tadashi. After much time, she graduates from his tutorship and leaves for America where she intends to use her talents to fight for justice. She takes the codename Katana after the sword that she wields, possessed for some time by the soul of her husband.

===Becoming an Outsider===
Eventually Tatsu journeys to Markovia, a small Baltic state, where she tracked down Karnz, and is successful in killing him, inadvertently implicating Black Lightning (coincidentally there with Batman) in her crime. Attempting to rectify the misunderstanding by freeing Black Lightning, she encounters a young girl named Halo. The two join up to rescue Black Lightning, Batman (himself captured due to a blunder by Halo), and Bruce Wayne&#x27;s employee Lucius Fox from their captor, Baron Bedlam.

Batman is himself in Markovia to rescue Lucius Fox, and having sought—and failed to gain—the help of the Justice League of America, resigned his membership in the Justice League. Inspired by the teamwork he encounters between Black Lightning, Katana, Halo, Geo-Force (Prince Brion of Markovia), and Metamorpho (also coincidentally present), Batman decides to form the Outsiders. The team manages to end the Baron&#x27;s tyranny in Markovia and moves to Gotham City, where they set up their headquarters (a former penthouse of Bruce Wayne / Batman). Tatsu becomes Halo&#x27;s guardian and the two move into the penthouse.

At the same time, Takeo is still at large and follows Tatsu to Gotham City. He attacks her and Halo at their home, overpowers Tatsu and switches swords with her. He leaves for Tokyo with Tatsu on his tail. The Outsiders follow Tatsu and offer their help, despite her desire to leave them out of it. Takeo takes the sword to his master Oyabun, the godfather of the yakuza. Performing a specific ritual, the Oyabun and Takeo call forth the souls that inhabit the sword and give them corporeal form. Among them are legendary mercenaries and assassins, but also Maseo, who is now a slave to the Oyabun. Katana— and the Outsiders— have to fight them all, but she is ultimately able to reclaim the Soultaker from Maseo. She is forced to kill her husband, and then take the opportunity to kill Takeo, finally putting some of her ghosts to rest. Maseo and those killed a second time by the Soultaker pass on to their eternal rewards, leaving Takeo trapped in the sword in his place.

At one point the Outsiders split from Batman&#x27;s leadership and take up residence in Markovia, where they are funded by its royal family. They become the official agents of Markovia and move to the city of Los Angeles and make their headquarters in the Markovian embassy, while retaining another secret HQ just off the shore. Although Tatsu left her past behind, the Oyabun return and send a tengu after her, with which he captures her. This mischievous spirit possesses her, and the Obayun is able to use her as an assassin. Her teammates Halo and Looker save her using other tengu and the tengu leader, who aids them in battle.

===Family debt===

After various tragic events surrounding Geo-Force&#x27;s parents and Markovia, the team disbands. Nonetheless the Outsiders are forced to defend Markovia against the Manhunters. During the fight, Halo is knocked into a coma, saving Katana&#x27;s life. Bounded by &quot;giri-ninjo&quot; (a debt of honor even unto death), Tatsu leaves the team to tend to Halo&#x27;s wounds. During that time, however, she is approached by a family member of her husband, who wishes her to accompany the Suicide Squad on a mission to destroy a large hoard of weapons that is about to be sold to the yakuza. She declines on the basis of her &quot;giri-ninjo&quot;, but is willing to help if the need is truly desperate. That family member is later killed, and she goes after the killer, the Daichi-Doku&#x27;s Oyabun (of which her relative is a member), who does not wish to see the weapons destroyed and tries to stop the Suicide Squad. During that adventure, she saves the life of Bronze Tiger and Manhunter (Mark Shaw), making them honor-bound to her by &quot;giri-ninjo&quot;. Mark Shaw then assists her in taking down the Daichi-Doku&#x27;s Oyabun. The Oyabun commits harakiri and Katana stands by as his &quot;second&quot;, ready to help with a blade strike so he can keep his honor.

===Returning to the Outsiders===
Eventually, the Outsiders re-form and return to Markovia. Instead of a peaceful reunion, however, the team becomes trapped in a web of public relations that brand them outlaws. Although the charges are dropped eventually, the team is fractured. Halo dies from an assassin&#x27;s blast but is reborn in a new body. This puts an immense strain on Tatsu&#x27;s relationship with Halo. Katana joins a team with Geo-Force and Technocrat, taking the lead. She develops a mild romantic relationship with Joey Hong, an Asian associate of Guy Gardner. During a lone mission, her old mentor Tadashi sends Lady Shiva to claim Katana&#x27;s Soultaker sword. Shiva confronts Katana, who is battling a gang of drug dealers. Katana slays many of them, but refuses to kill the youngest member, something Shiva insults her for. Shiva, renowned as the world&#x27;s greatest assassin and fighter, kills Katana with her own sword. Katana returns to life after a trial by combat within her sword, which includes confronting many of the souls of the people she killed. Afterwards, she finds her old mentor and takes his life. The two splinter teams eventually reunite to take on more supernatural threats focused around the new team member Sebastian Faust. Katana and her friends suffer through the mental and physical tortures that Faust&#x27;s father, Felix, put them through. Halo eventually frees them by destroying several of Felix&#x27;s items of power. Soon after, the group breaks apart. After disbanding, Tatsu keeps her association with her old allies among the Outsiders (such as Black Lightning, Geo-Force, and Halo), and although they do not operate as an official team, they are always together during major crises. Her close ties to Batman also see her fighting by his side, several times, notably during the Imperiex crisis and the Day of Judgment incident when Hell invaded Earth. The main battle against the villain, the rogue angel Asmodel, with the power of the Spectre, takes place in New York. Katana personally protects Madame Xanadu who guards the rest of Asmodel&#x27;s power with a mystical shield. Katana&#x27;s protection of Xanadu is assisted by Doctor Occult, Phantom Stranger, and Alan Scott. Later, Katana assists Batman when he and Superman are declared outlaws. Katana is also called upon by Black Canary, together with other female mercenaries, to rescue Oracle from Senator Pullman. After Oracle is saved, Katana receives a card, together with the promise of a favor if required. Katana later returns to aid Oracle in issue #108 alongside dozens of other agents.

===New Outsiders===
Later Katana joins a new team of Outsiders after assisting them in defeating a more powerful Sabbac. That team consists of all new members, with the exception of Metamorpho who rejoins the team after Shift&#x27;s demise. In &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) #42, Katana dons a new costume, as she feels it inappropriate to wear a costume based on Japan&#x27;s flag, since the country revoked her citizenship due to her membership with the controversial team. Later, Katana summons Sabbac to destroy Dr. Sivana&#x27;s base with his Hellfire. Katana remains an active member of the Outsiders following the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; continuity jump. Initially, the team is led by Nightwing, but later leadership transfers to Batman. Batman decides to &#x27;test&#x27; Katana and the rest of the initial team to design a better team. Katana is Batman&#x27;s first official recruit.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===

While escorting Killer Croc to incarceration, the Outsiders&#x27; vehicle is demolished by Maseo, Yuki, and Reiko, who have all been revived as Black Lanterns. Katana, believing that she has been reunited with her lost family, lets her guard down, but is saved from death by her teammates. Realising the truth, she draws her sword, preparing to fight her undead husband. When Katana stabs Maseo, Soultaker reveals to her the Black Lanterns&#x27; full intentions. Her attacks soon prove to be completely ineffectual against Maseo, who is instead destroyed by an outpouring of light from Halo, who also destroyed Katana&#x27;s undead children.

===New 52===

The events of the 2011 &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline led to The New 52, a relaunch of all of DC Comics&#x27; monthly books, and a reboot to the DC Universe in-story continuity. In this new continuity, a newly healed Barbara Gordon returns to the Batgirl identity and takes a leave of absence from the Birds of Prey and suggests that Katana take her place full-time on the team.

Katana joins Black Canary and Starling as the third member of the Birds of Prey. Katana is described as a lethal fighter who has spent the last year waging war on the yakuza clan that is responsible for the death of her husband. She is rumored to be mentally unstable due to her belief that her husband&#x27;s soul, whom she often converses with in Japanese, resides in her sword.

After a number of adventures with the Birds of Prey, Katana leaves the group to keep an eye on a cult of assassins known as the Daggers. She later accepts membership in Amanda Waller&#x27;s new Justice League of America in exchange for information on her husband&#x27;s murderers. When DC launched &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, they also launched the solo series &quot;Katana&quot;, focusing on Tatsu&#x27;s abiding mission to track down her husband&#x27;s killer. The series lasted 10 issues. After this, Katana made an appearance in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5) #27 (2014), where she is told by the mysterious blind man Magus that the death of her husband relates to the Outsiders, the society formed of various weapon clans and connected to Green Arrow&#x27;s new origin story. The Soultaker is worked into the Green Arrow mythology as the totem of the Sword Clan, which has parallels in the Fist, Mask, Shield, Axe, Arrow, and Spear Clans. Representatives from each of these clans make up the Outsiders, a secret society dedicated towards ending global corruption, but which is itself largely corrupt. Katana joins the Outsiders. In &quot;Green Arrow: Futures End&quot; #1 (2014), set five years later in one possible future, Tatsu is shown to still be a member of the Outsiders, which has developed a grudging relationship with Green Arrow, who rejected leadership of the Arrow Clan in the main &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series five years before.

===DC Rebirth===
Amanda Waller recruits Katana to be a co-captain of the Suicide Squad. Later, she joins the latest iteration of The Outsiders.

==Powers, abilities, and weapons==
Katana is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant and swordswoman, having studied martial arts as a child and later being trained by the samurai Tadashi. From her time with the Outsiders and Batman, she develops strong tactical skills.

Katana&#x27;s Soultaker sword, along with its non-powered twin, was forged in the 14th century by Muramasa, whose swords are said to be cursed and make those who are evil commit evil acts. It sometimes takes the souls of those it kills, storing them inside the sword, where they can engage in limited communication with whoever wields it. These souls and spirits can be freely reborn/reincarnated by the means of a sacred ritual, under which they serve their summoner, even if it is against their will. Its cutting edge is sharp enough to rend the Dilustel skin of Captain Atom and Major Force. In The New 52, the Soultaker is established as being the &#x27;Sword Totem&#x27; of the Outsiders, meaning like the other totems, it supposedly bestows immortality and enlightenment upon its wielder, although some like Green Arrow are skeptical of the literal truths of these statements.

In addition to the Soultaker, Katana often carries additional weaponry into battle.

<doc id="715297" wikidata="Q1941852" url="?curid=715297" title="Solar System model">
<text>Solar System models, especially mechanical models, called &quot;orreries&quot;, that illustrate the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons in the Solar System have been built for centuries. While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a scale model of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.

If the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance. The Boston Museum of Science had placed bronze models of the planets in major public buildings, all on similar stands with interpretive labels. For example, the model of Jupiter was located in the cavernous South Station waiting area. The properly-scaled, basket-ball-sized model is 1.3 miles (2.14 km) from the model Sun which is located at the museum, graphically illustrating the immense empty space in the Solar System. 

The objects in such large models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move, and some used clockworks to display the relative speeds of objects accurately. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in &quot;time&quot;, instead of &quot;distance&quot;.

==Permanent true scale models==
Many towns and institutions have built outdoor scale models of the Solar System. Here is a table comparing these models with the actual system.

==Other models of the Solar System: historic, temporary, virtual, or dual-scale==
Several sets of geocaching caches have been laid out as Solar System models.

<doc id="715299" wikidata="Q2123262" url="?curid=715299" title="Lincoln Park">
<text>Lincoln Park is a park along Lake Michigan on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. Named after US president Abraham Lincoln, it is the city&#x27;s largest public park and stretches for seven miles (11 km) from Grand Avenue (500 N), on the south, to near Ardmore Avenue (5800 N) on the north, just north of the DuSable Lake Shore Drive terminus at Hollywood Avenue. Two museums and a zoo are located in the oldest part of the park between North Avenue (1600 N) and Diversey Parkway (2800 N) in the eponymous neighborhood. Further to the north, the park is characterized by parkland, beaches, recreational areas, nature reserves, and harbors. To the south, there is a more narrow strip of beaches east of Lake Shore Drive, almost to downtown. With 20 million visitors per year, Lincoln Park is the second-most-visited city park in the United States, behind Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park.

The park&#x27;s recreational facilities include baseball/softball fields, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, cricket pitches, football/soccer fields, a golf course, lacrosse fields, rugby pitches, tennis courts, volleyball courts, field houses, a target archery field, a skate park, and a driving range.

The park also features several harbors with boating facilities, as well as public beaches for swimming, and nature reserves. There are landscaped gardens, public art, bird refuges, a zoo, the Lincoln Park Conservatory, the Chicago History Museum, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool, and a theater on the lake with regular outdoor performances held during the summer.

==History==

In 1860, Lake Park (earlier, Cemetery Park), the precursor of today&#x27;s park, was established by the city on the lands just to the north of the city&#x27;s burial ground. Five years later, on June 12, 1865, the park was renamed to honor the recently assassinated President Abraham Lincoln.

Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, part of the oldest section of today&#x27;s Lincoln Park near North Avenue began its existence as the City Cemetery in 1843. This was subdivided into a Potter&#x27;s Field, Catholic cemetery, Jewish cemetery, and the general City Cemetery. These cemeteries were the only cemeteries in the Chicago area until 1859. In 1852, David Kennison, who is said to have been born in 1736, died and was buried in City Cemetery. Another notable burial in the cemetery was Chicago Mayor James Curtiss, whose body was lost when the cemetery was added to the park.

Throughout the late 1850s, there was discussion of closing the cemetery or abandoning it because of health concerns. In fall 1858, Dr. John H. Rauch MD suggested that the burial grounds were a health risk, which &quot;might serve extremely well for plantations of grove and forest trees&quot; that would be &quot;useful and ornamental to the city.&quot; The idea was dropped during the Civil War, but revived by Dr. Rauch after the war ended.

By 1864, the city council had decided to add all the cemetery lands north of North Avenue to the park by relocating the graves. The cemetery sections south of North Avenue were also relocated but this land was left for residential development. An estimated 35,000 people total were buried in the cemetery sections of the park, and the plan required the removal of these graves to other newly opened cemeteries further from the city and lake. To this day, the Couch mausoleum can still be seen as the most visible reminder of the history as a cemetery, standing amidst trees, behind the Chicago History Museum. Ira Couch, who is interred in the tomb, was one of Chicago&#x27;s earliest innkeepers, opening the Tremont House in 1835. Couch is believed to not be the only person interred in the old burial ground in Lincoln Park. A plaque placed nearby states that &quot;the remains of six Couch family members and one family friend are in the tomb.&quot; Partially due to the destruction of the Chicago Fire of wooden burial markers, it was difficult to identify many of the remains. As recently as 1998, construction in the park revealed more bodies left over in the nineteenth century burial ground.

Another large and notable group of graves relocated from the site of today&#x27;s Lincoln Park were those of approximately 4,000 Confederate prisoners of war who died at Camp Douglas. Many prisoners perished between 1862 and 1865 as a result of the poor condition they were in when taken on the battlefield, or of disease and privation existing at the Federal prison. Although the camp was located south of downtown Chicago, near the stockyards, the remains were originally interred at the site of today&#x27;s Lincoln Park. Today, their gravesites may be found at Oak Woods Cemetery in the southern part of Chicago. A one-acre (4,000 m2) mass grave and a monument erected by Southerners and Chicago friends in 1895 memorializes these Southerners whose earthly remnants remain in the North. Author George Levy believes that remains of many of the Confederate prisoners are still to be found beneath what are currently baseball fields, the former site of the potter&#x27;s field.

From the 1860s through the 1950s the park expanded south and then north along seven miles (11 km) of Chicago&#x27;s Lakefront. (See reference notes 1, 2 and 3). The establishment of public parkland along all of Chicago&#x27;s Lakefront was a central tenet of the 1909 Burnham Plan for the development of Chicago. From 1912 until 1991, the park contained the Lincoln Park Gun Club.

Another aspect of park history were the Young Lords Lincoln Park neighborhood sit ins and take-overs of institutions under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, protesting the displacement of Latinos by Mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s urban renewal policies. 

It was also the scene of violent events that took place during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. These events transpired around the convention center, Grant Park, Old Town, and the park.

==Zoo, conservatory and museums==

===Zoo===

Lincoln Park is well known for the Lincoln Park Zoo, a free zoo that is open year-round. Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. It includes big cats, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totaling to nearly 1,250 animals. Two sections of Lincoln Park Zoo have been set aside for children. The partially indoor Pritzker Family Children&#x27;s Zoo includes habitats of various North American wildlife. The Farm-in-the-Zoo is a working reproduction of a Midwestern farm containing horses and livestock such as pigs, cows, and sheep. At the Farm-in-the-Zoo, children can feed and interact with the animals and view live demonstrations of farm work such as the milking of cows. In 2010, the Zoo transformed the South Pond, to create a wildlife marsh habitat, with a Nature Boardwalk.

===Conservatory===


The Lincoln Park Conservatory offers year-round displays of plants from many different climates around the world. Today&#x27;s conservatory was built in stages from 1890 to 1895. It consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and opened to the public in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 15 m (50 ft) fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. In the Palm House, one can also find Garden Figure, a sculpture by Frederick Hibbard. The Fern Room or Fernery was opened in 1895. It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns. The Tropical Room was originally called the stove house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark-covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. The Display House is used for seasonal flower and plant exhibits. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy provides free tours of the Conservatory and its outdoor gardens from 1–4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays and from 9 to Noon on Saturdays.

===Lily Pool===


Located on Fullerton Parkway between Stockton and Cannon Drives, the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool is an historic example of Prairie School landscape architecture. The Lily Pool was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a National Historic Landmark on February 17, 2006. The Lily Pool had originally been built to cultivate tropical water lilies in 1889. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration hired landscape architect Alfred Caldwell to redesign the pool in the Prairie School style. From 1998 to 2002, the Lily Pool underwent an extensive restoration by the Lincoln Park Conservancy and the Chicago Park District, which earned the site its historic designations, and renamed the site after Alfred Caldwell. The Lily Pool is open seasonally from mid-April to mid-November from 7:30 a.m. to the earlier of dusk or 7:30 p.m. every day. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy offers free tours from 1–4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and from 9 – Noon on Saturdays during operating season.

===Nature Museum===


First established in 1857, the &quot;Chicago Academy of Sciences&quot; opened its most recent facility, the Nature Museum, in 1999. The Academy&#x27;s previous museum building, the Matthew Laflin Memorial Building, was the Park District&#x27;s first museum in the parks. The museum&#x27;s exhibits include displays about the ecological history of the Illinois region, a live butterfly house, and a green home demonstration. The butterfly house features over 200 species of exotic butterflies. The museum also offers educational programs for adults and children.

===History Museum===

Located at Clark Street and North Avenue, the Chicago History Museum (formerly the Chicago Historical Society) is dedicated to Chicago&#x27;s human history. Perhaps among its most well-known possessions are Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s deathbed and several furniture pieces from the room where he died in the Petersen House in Washington, D.C., as well as clothing he and wife Mary Todd Lincoln wore the evening of his assassination. The museum also houses Chicago&#x27;s most important collection of materials related to local history from the Great Chicago Fire to the Young Lords in Lincoln Park. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house an extensive research library which includes books and other published materials, manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and photos.

==Recreational areas==

===Facilities===

Lincoln Park runs from north to south through five Chicago community areas: Edgewater, Uptown, Lake View, Lincoln Park, and Near North. Along its seven-mile (11 km) stretch, Lincoln Park has many specialized spaces for recreational activities. The Park contains playgrounds; basketball, beach volleyball, tennis, volleyball courts, boating facilities; beaches; swimming; field and beach houses; running and bike paths; playing fields and pitches; archery, baseball, cricket, football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball; a golf course; a driving range; skate park, and areas for horseback riding. Near Montrose Point is Cricket Hill, one of few sledding hills available in Chicago parks.

===Beaches===

There are seven public beaches for swimming, sunbathing, and beach volleyball along the park&#x27;s 7-mile shoreline that are guarded during the summer months. The beaches from north to south are, Thorndale, Hollywood, and Foster in Edgewater; Montrose in Uptown; North Avenue in Lincoln Park; and Oak Street and Ohio in Near North. The first City of Chicago public beach, North Avenue Beach, opened in Lincoln Park in 1895. The Lincoln Park Passerelle, a footbridge, connected to the beach in 1940 over the newly constructed Lake Shore Drive.

===Golf===
The Waveland Avenue Golf Course (now Sydney R. Marovitz Golf Course) in the Uptown and Lakeview, Chicago neighborhoods section of the park provides a lakeside setting for the game. () Known for its challenging narrow fairways, it offers nine tees on a par-36 course. Further south, inland of Lakeshore Drive, is a driving range and miniature golf course.

===Boating===
There are three harbors in the Park providing marina and docking facilities for boaters: north to south, they are Montrose in Uptown, Lakeview&#x27;s Belmont Harbor, and Diversey Harbor in the Lakeview and the Lincoln Park Neighborhoods. Montrose Harbor provides 630 dock facilities and is home to the Chicago Corinthian Yacht Club. Belmont Harbor provides 730 moorings, a fuel dock and a ship store. The Chicago Yacht Club has a Belmont station and the Belmont Yacht Club is located here. Diversey Harbor has 714 moorings and the Diversey Yacht Club provides a fueling dock. There is also a public launch at Diversey and the park also has rowing, sculling, and crewing channels.

===Chicago Lakefront Trail===
The Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path in Chicago along the coast of Lake Michigan. It is popular with cyclists and joggers. It is designed to promote bicycle commuting. From north to south, it runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park.
==Wildlife==

===North Pond===

The North Pond Nature Sanctuary (), located between Fullerton, Diversey, Stockton and Cannon, is a ten-acre pond that has become an important wildlife area. Historically the site was a dune, then a dumping ground, and an ornamental pond; it was converted in 1999–2000 into a natural area with a littoral zone that greatly improved the water quality by re-establishing native Midwestern ecology. The upland restoration of prairie, savanna, and woodland plants has included only top quality native species such as little bluestem, sky-blue aster, nodding wild onion, side-oats grama, butterfly weed, purple prairie clover, rough blazing star, wild quinine, prairie phlox, coneflowers, false dragonhead, northern prairie dropseed, showy goldenrod, rattlesnake master, shooting star, and wild bergamot. The North Pond Nature Sanctuary is notable as the site where Mayor Richard M. Daley and the US Fish and Wildlife Service signed an Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds in April 2004, making the city eligible for federal funds to restore habitat for the lakefront migratory pathway for birds.

Restoration with native plants has drawn a great diversity of wildlife to this urban pond including many species of birds, turtles, frogs, and even a few beavers. Great blue herons, black-crowned night herons, green herons, mallards, wood ducks, song sparrows and woodpeckers can regularly be spotted at the North Pond Nature Sanctuary.
===Animal sanctuaries===

Further north in the park, in the Lake View neighborhood (3600 N), there is the Bill Jarvis Migratory Bird Sanctuary (; formerly, Lincoln Park Addison Migratory Bird Sanctuary). First landscaped and constructed with limited public access in the 1920s, under the leadership of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, its spring is supplied with city water to mimic a natural lake marsh environment, with attendant forest and meadow environments.
Most of its area is entirely fenced around to preserve the habitat from human encroachment. Instead, a nature trail and a viewing platform are at its surrounding perimeter. During the 1940s, its Park District caretakers lost funding and the site was padlocked. In 1968, the entire site was almost bulldozed for golf course development but its Lake View neighbors, including Bill Jarvis, led a successful campaign to save and restore it. Today it hosts more than 150 species of birds, including six species of herons, like the black crowned night heron; wood ducks; woodcock; hawks; yellow-billed cuckoos; hummingbirds; thrushes; vireos; 34 species of warblers; and 18 native species of sparrows. In addition, small mammals such as rabbit, opossum, raccoon, and occasionally fox and coyote make their home there.

In the Uptown neighborhood (4400 N; ), there is the Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary (including &quot;The Magic Hedge&quot;). During the Cold War, Montrose point, which juts out into Lake Michigan, was used by the United States Army as a Nike missile base. The Army camouflaged their missile launchers and barracks behind honeysuckle hedges. When the Army left in the 1970s, bird watchers noticed how the honeysuckle attracted birds. They successfully lobbied the park district for a new preserve. After extensive replanting, the site supports woodland, tall prairie, and lake dune habitat that annually attracts tens of thousands of migratory birds of more than 300 different species. The Uptown Natural Area, opened in 2022, features nature trails through six acres of native prairie and savanna.

==Public art==
Lincoln Park is known for its statuary, being referred to as &quot;Chicago&#x27;s outdoor Statuary Hall&quot; by WBEZ. &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Man&quot; is a famous standing Lincoln statue in Lincoln Park by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the same sculptor who created &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State&quot; in Grant Park. Replicas of Lincoln Park&#x27;s &quot;Standing Lincoln&quot; can be found at Lincoln&#x27;s tomb, Springfield and in Parliament Square, London. The statue is located at Dearborn Street and North Avenue. It was fully restored in 1989 by the Lincoln Park Conservancy&#x27;s Adopt-A-Monument Program, and 8,200 square feet of formal gardens were added in front of the monument.

The only other person memorialized in statue in both Grant and Lincoln parks is Alexander Hamilton; the statue of Hamilton was sculpted by John Angel. Just as there is an Abraham Lincoln statue in Grant Park, there is a large memorial to Ulysses S. Grant in Lincoln Park overlooking Cannon Drive. The sculpture was created in 1891 by Louis Rebisso.

The statue of Hans Christian Andersen by Johannes Gelert (1896) on Stockton Drive near Webster Avenue provides a tribute to the Danish storyteller. The Eugene Field Memorial (1922) designed by Edward McCartan remembers the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; columnist and poet who wrote &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; and &quot;Winken, Blinken, and Nod&quot;. William Ordway Partridge&#x27;s statue of William Shakespeare (1894) provides a third great story-teller in Lincoln Park. This seated Shakespeare includes a lap for children to climb onto. A bust of Sir Georg Solti, a conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was also situated in the Lincoln Park Conservatory&#x27;s formal garden until its relocation to Grant Park in 2006. Statues honoring the German poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller can also be found in Lincoln Park. The large Goethe statue is located near Diversey Parkway and Stockton Drive. The smaller Schiller statue is located near the western entrance to the zoo. Cyrus Edwin Dallin&#x27;s 1890 &quot;A Signal of Peace&quot; is exhibited at the park.

At Addison Street stands a totem pole depicting Kwanusila the Thunderbird. A statue of John Peter Altgeld (1915), the nineteenth-century Illinois Governor who pardoned the men convicted in the Haymarket affair bombing, can be seen just south of Diversey. This statue was created by Gutzon Borglum and unveiled on September 6 (Labor Day), 1915.

==In media==
The 1980 film &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; contains several scenes filmed in Lincoln Park.

Phil Ochs&#x27; song &quot;William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed&quot;, featured on his 1969 &quot;Rehearsals for Retirement&quot; album, is about his experience walking through the park during the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests.

==Other==
In 2004 the Lincoln Park Lagooners were inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

Anderson currently owns Michel&#x27;s at The Colony Surf, a premier oceanfront restaurant in Waikīkī dubbed as the &quot;Most Romantic Restaurant&quot; by the popular TV series &quot; Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous&quot;. He also owns commercial real estate properties both in Hawaii and mainland USA.

Anderson&#x27;s real estate development projects include The Bluffs in Waimea consisting of 23 lots on a lush hillside overlooking the ocean between Waimea bay and Haleiwa town and Sunset Beach Colony consisting of 29 subdivided parcels on beachfront 19.1 acre property fronting Velzyland and Kaunala Bay. Both projects are located on the North Shore on the island of Oahu. Anderson also owned Waimea Golf Club, an 18-hole, 6,646-yard, par-72 course, 239 acre land on the island of the Big Island.

Anderson was a member of the Hawai&#x27;i State House of Representatives from 1962 to 1966. He was a member of the Hawai&#x27;i State Senate from 1967 to 1983. In 1968 and 1972, Anderson ran unsuccessfully to become the Republican Mayor of Honolulu. Anderson served as managing director of Honolulu (under Mayor Frank Fasi) from January 2, 1985, to July 3, 1986. In 1982 and 1986, as Chairman of the Hawai&#x27;i Republican Party, he ran for Governor of Hawai&#x27;i and lost. In 1986 he lost by a narrow 52% to 48% margin. In 2002, Anderson joined the Hawai&#x27;i Democratic Party and ran for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor. He lost to incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mazie K. Hirono.

<text>The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as Messier 51a (M51a) or NGC 5194, is an interacting grand-design spiral galaxy with a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus. It lies in the constellation Canes Venatici, and was the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy. It is 31 million lightyears (9.5 megaparsecs/Mpc) away and in diameter.

The galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195, are easily observed by amateur astronomers, and the two galaxies may be seen with binoculars. The Whirlpool Galaxy has been extensively observed by professional astronomers, who study it and its pair with dwarf galaxy NGC 5195 to understand galaxy structure (particularly structure associated with the spiral arms) and galaxy interactions. Its pair with NGC 5195 is among the most famous and relatively close interacting systems, and thus is a favorite subject of galaxy interaction models.

==Discovery==
 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, employing a reflecting telescope at Birr Castle, Ireland, found that the Whirlpool possessed a spiral structure, the first &quot;nebula&quot; to be known to have one. These &quot;spiral nebulae&quot; were not recognized as galaxies until Edwin Hubble was able to observe Cepheid variables in some of these spiral nebulae, which provided evidence that they were so far away that they must be entirely separate galaxies. 
The Whirlpool Galaxy was discovered on October 13, 1773, by Charles Messier while searching for objects that might confuse comet hunters. It was later cataloged as M51 in Messier&#x27;s list of astronomical objects.

The advent of radio astronomy and subsequent radio images of M51 unequivocally demonstrated that the Whirlpool and its companion galaxy are indeed interacting. Sometimes the designation M51 is used to refer to the pair of galaxies, in which case the individual galaxies may be referred to as M51a (NGC 5194) and M51b (NGC 5195).

==Visual appearance==
Deep in the constellation Canes Venatici, M51 is often found by finding the easternmost star of the Big Dipper, Alkaid, and going 3.5° southwest. Its declination is, rounded, +47°, making it circumpolar (never setting) for observers above the 43rd parallel north; it reaches a high altitude throughout this hemisphere making it an accessible object from the early hours in November through to the end of May, after which observation is more coincidental in modest latitudes with the risen sun (due to the Sun approaching to and receding from its right ascension, specifically figuring in Gemini, just to the north).

M51 is visible through binoculars under dark sky conditions, and it can be resolved in detail with modern amateur telescopes. When seen through a 100 mm telescope the basic outlines of M51 (limited to 5×6&#x27;) and its companion are visible. Under dark skies, and with a moderate eyepiece through a 150 mm telescope, M51&#x27;s intrinsic spiral structure can be detected. With larger (&gt;300 mm) instruments under dark sky conditions, the various spiral bands are apparent with HII regions visible, and M51 can be seen to be attached to M51B.

As is usual for galaxies, the true extent of its structure can only be gathered from inspecting photographs; long exposures reveal a large nebula extending beyond the visible circular appearance. In 1984, thanks to the high-speed detector—the so-called image-photon-counting-system (IPCS)—developed jointly by the CNRS Laboratoire d&#x27;Astronomie Spatiald (L.A.S.-CNRS) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence (O.H.P.) along with the particularly nice visibility offered by the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (C.F.H.T.) 3.60m Cassegrain focus on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, Hua et al. detected the double component of the very nucleus of the Whirlpool Galaxy.

In January 2005 the Hubble Heritage Project constructed a 11,477 × 7,965-pixel composite image (shown in the infobox above) of M51 using Hubble&#x27;s ACS instrument. The image highlights the galaxy&#x27;s spiral arms, and shows detail into some of the structures inside the arms.

==Properties==
The Whirlpool Galaxy lies at a distance of 23 to 31 million light-years from Earth. Based on the 1991 measurement by the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies using the D25 isophote at the B-band, the Whirlpool Galaxy has a diameter of . Overall the galaxy is about 88% the size of the Milky Way. Its mass is estimated to be 160 billion solar masses, or around 10.3% of the mass of Milky Way Galaxy. It&#x27;s believed to be an estimated 400 million years old.

A black hole, once thought to be surrounded by a ring of dust, but now believed to be partially occluded by dust instead, exists at the heart of the spiral. A pair of ionization cones extend from the active galactic nucleus.

===Spiral structure===
The Whirlpool Galaxy has two, very prominent spiral arms that wind clockwise. One arm deviates from a constant angle significantly. The pronounced spiral structure of the Whirlpool Galaxy is believed to be the result of the close interaction between it and its companion galaxy NGC 5195, which may have passed through the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. In this proposed scenario, NGC 5195 came from behind M51 through the disk towards the observer and made another disk crossing as recently as 50 to 100 million years ago until it is where we observe it to be now, slightly behind M51.

===Tidal features===
As a result of the Whirlpool Galaxy&#x27;s interaction with NGC 5195, a variety of tidal features have been created. The largest of these features is the so-called Northwest plume, which extends out to from the galaxy&#x27;s center. This plume is uniform in color and likely originated from the Whirlpool Galaxy itself due to having diffuse gas. Adjacent to it are two other plumes that have a slightly bluer color, referred to as the Western plumes due to their location.

In 2015, a study discovered two new tidal features caused by the interaction between the Whirlpool Galaxy and NGC 5195, the &quot;Northeast plume&quot; and the &quot;South plume&quot;. The study remarks that a simulation that takes into account only one passage of NGC 5195 into the Whirlpool Galaxy will fail to produce an analogue to the Northeast tail. In contrast, the multiple-passage simulations made by Salo and Laurikainen et.al reproduce the northeast plume. 

===Star formation===
The central region of M51 appears to be undergoing a period of enhanced star formation. The present efficiency of star formation, defined as the ratio of mass of new stars to the mass of star-forming gas, is only ~1%, quite comparable to the global value for the Milky Way and other galaxies. It is estimated that the current high rate of star formation can last no more than another 100 million years or so.
Similarly, the spiral arms are experiencing high levels of star formation, as well as the space along the arms.

===Transient events===
Three supernovae have been observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy:

In 1994, SN 1994I was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy. It was classified as type Ic, indicating that its progenitor star was very massive and had already shed much of its mass, and its brightness peaked at apparent magnitude 12.91.

In June 2005 the type II supernova SN 2005cs was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at apparent magnitude 14.

On 31 May 2011 a type II supernova was detected in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at magnitude 12.1. This supernova, designated SN 2011dh, showed a spectrum much bluer than average, with P Cygni profiles, which indicate rapidly expanding material, in its hydrogen-Balmer lines. The progenitor was probably a yellow supergiant and not a red or blue supergiant, which are thought to be the most common supernova progenitors.

On 22 January 2019, a supernova impostor, designated AT 2019abn, was discovered in Messier 51. The transient was later identified as a luminous red nova. The progenitor star was detected in archival Spitzer Space Telescope infrared images. No object could be seen at the position of the transient in archival Hubble images, indicating that the progenitor star was heavily obstructed by interstellar dust. 2019abn peaked at magnitude 17, reaching an intrinsic brightness of formula_1.

===Planet candidate===
In September 2020, the detection by the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a candidate exoplanet, named M51-ULS-1b, orbiting the high-mass X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 in this galaxy was announced. If confirmed, it would be the first known instance of an extragalactic planet: a planet outside the Milky Way. The planet candidate was detected by eclipses of the X-ray source (XRS), which consists of a stellar remnant (either a neutron star or a black hole) and a massive star, likely a B-type supergiant. The planet would be slightly smaller than Saturn and orbit at a distance of some tens of astronomical units.

==Companion==
NGC 5195 (also known as Messier 51b or M51b) is a dwarf galaxy that is interacting with the Whirlpool Galaxy (also known as M51a or NGC 5194). Both galaxies are found in the constellation Canes Venatici, some 31 million light-years away. These two galaxies are among the most extensively researched pairs of interacting galaxies.

==Galaxy group information==
The Whirlpool Galaxy is the brightest galaxy in the M51 Group, a small group of galaxies that also includes M63 (the Sunflower Galaxy), NGC 5023, and NGC 5229. This small group may actually be a subclump at the southeast end of a large, elongated group that includes the M101 Group and the NGC 5866 Group, although most group identification methods and catalogs identify the three groups as separate entities.

<text>Stargate is a horizontally scrolling shooter released as an arcade video game in 1981 by Williams Electronics. Created by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar, it is a sequel to &quot;Defender&quot; which was released earlier in the year. It was the first of only three productions from Vid Kidz, an independent development house formed by Jarvis and DeMar. Some home ports of &quot;Stargate&quot; were renamed to Defender II for legal reasons.

This sequel adds new ships to the alien fleet, including Firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies, Dynamos, Phreds, Big Reds, Munchies and Space Hums. The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate transports the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are two special stages: the Yllabian Dogfight, first appearing at wave 5 and recurring every 10 waves; and the Firebomber Showdown, first appearing at wave 10 and also recurring every 10 waves.

==Gameplay==

The player flies a small spaceship above a scrolling, mountainous landscape which wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually return to the starting point. The player&#x27;s ship flies in front of the landscape and does not contact it.

The terrain is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. Enemy ships fly overhead. The goal is to destroy the enemies to prevent the humans from being captured.

The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of &quot;Inviso&quot; cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with.

At the top of the screen is a mini-map, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape.

===Aliens===
There are fifteen types of aliens:
* Lander - the primary enemy on every level. Landers teleport into the level in staggered waves, and attempt to capture humanoids by descending upon them and dragging them into the air; if they make it to the top of the screen with a human, the two fuse together into a more dangerous Mutant. Landers can fire projectiles at the player.
* Mutant - a mutated Lander. Mutants home in on the player at constant speed, firing projectiles. They move erratically, making them difficult to shoot.
* Baiter - a flat, iridescent spacecraft that teleports in if the player is taking too long to complete a level. Homes in on the player and attempts to match their speed, while firing accurate projectiles. A difficult opponent due to its unbeatable speed and tiny horizontal cross-section, which makes it very hard to shoot.
* Bomber - a box-shaped alien that lays stationary mines in the air.
* Pod - a star-like alien that bursts into a number of Swarmers when shot.
* Swarmer - a tiny teardrop-shaped alien that moves very quickly in an undulating fashion. Difficult to shoot.
* Firebomber - a rotating variation on the Bomber, which shoots high speed Fireballs at the player.
* Yllabian Space Guppie - an undulating attacker, which attacks in swarms and homes in on the ship.
* Phreds and Big Reds - square aliens which look like they are constantly opening and closing their mouths. Similar to the Firebombers, they launch tiny versions of themselves called Munchies.
* Dynamos - diamond-shaped ships composed of clusters of Space Hums, which periodically break off to attack the ship independently. Once all aliens (except Fireballs, Space Hums, Baiters, Phreds, Big Reds, and Munchies) are destroyed, the player progresses to the next level.

===Humanoids===
The game starts with ten Humanoids inhabiting the planet. Landers will attempt to capture and fuse with them during play.

To rescue a Humanoid from capture, the player must kill the Lander holding it while it is in the air, causing the Humanoid to drop. At low height Humanoids can survive the drop on their own, but if the Lander is killed at too high an altitude, the player must catch the Humanoid with their ship and return him to the ground, otherwise he will not survive the drop. A player&#x27;s ship can carry as many Humanoids as are alive on that level.

The Humanoids can be killed by the player&#x27;s weapon just as easily as the aliens can, so careful aim is required when firing near them.

If all Humanoids are killed, the entire planet explodes, leaving the player in empty space. This also has the unfortunate effect of turning every Lander into a Mutant, making the player&#x27;s job very difficult.

Every time the player completes 5 waves of enemies (i.e. at wave 6, 11, 16 and so forth), the planet (and all its 10 Humanoids) is restored.

===Scoring===
As well as the points gained by killing aliens, scores are also awarded as follows:
* Humanoid falling back to the ground without dying: 250 points
* Catching a falling humanoid: 500, 1000, 1,500, and 2,000 points, depending on number of humanoids carried at the time.
* Returning a humanoid to the ground: 500 points
* Humanoid surviving the level: 100 points per humanoid for 1st wave, 200 per humanoid on 2nd wave, up to a maximum of 500 points from 5th wave onwards
* End-of-wave humanoid bonus: If all enemies are destroyed and a humanoid is falling to the ground, the player receives a 2,000 point bonus if the ship is positioned at ground level directly under the humanoid, so as to simultaneously catch the humanoid and place it back on the ground. If the player simply catches the humanoid in mid-air while above the ground, the wave ends with the player only receiving the 500 points for catching the humanoid.
* If the player accumulates 999 ships and gets awarded another ship, the counter wraps around, eliminating all ships but the one being awarded, and the one currently being played with.

By default, the player receives an extra life, smart bomb, and Inviso energy every 10,000 points. This amount can be overridden when the machine is in maintenance mode. As in &quot;Defender&quot;, at 9,990,000, those bonuses are given for every enemy destroyed.

===Controls===
The control system of &quot;Stargate&quot; expands on that of &quot;Defender&quot;. The game has a joystick to move up and down, a Reverse button to toggle the player&#x27;s horizontal direction, and a Thrust button to move in that direction. There is also a Fire button for shooting, a button to activate a Smart Bomb, a button to turn on the Inviso cloaking device, and a Hyperspace button which teleports the player to a random position in the level, at the risk of either exploding upon rematerialization, or materializing onto an enemy or enemy projectile, and then exploding.

===The Stargate===
A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, represented by a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions.

If a Lander is in the process of abducting a Humanoid, flying into the Stargate will teleport the ship to where the Humanoid is under attack. If more than one Humanoid is being captured, the ship will be taken to the Lander that is closest to the top of the screen. If a Humanoid is being captured while a Humanoid is falling to the ground, the ship will be taken to the Humanoid that is falling to the ground. Otherwise, entering the Stargate will teleport the ship to the opposite side of the planet.

If the ship is carrying at least four humanoids, entering the Stargate will &quot;warp&quot; the game ahead three levels. This allows more advanced players to skip the easier lower levels and also get a great number of points, extra lives, smart bombs, and inviso energy. Warping is only allowed in the first 10 levels, and can be avoided (if desired) by flying into the Stargate in reverse, allowing a player to continue on the current level.

==Ports==
Ports of &quot;Stargate&quot; were being developed for the Atari 5200 console and the Atari 8-bit computers by Atari, Inc. programmer Steve Baker in 1984, but were not released. The game was also ported to the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC.

The Family Computer port developed by HAL (renamed &quot;Star Gate&quot;, and later named &quot;Defender II&quot; for U.S. release) has some elements in common with their &quot;Millipede&quot; (renamed &quot;Milli-Pede&quot;, later named back to &quot;Millipede&quot; for U.S. release) and &quot;Joust&quot; ports, as well as &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;, all of which were released around the same time. In particular, the title jingles for &quot;Milli-Pede,&quot; &quot;Star Gate, and&quot; &quot;Joust&quot; are almost identical, the music played when &quot;Star Gate&quot; begins is a longer version of the opponent entrance music from &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, and the music played during &quot;Star Gate&quot;&#x27;s intermission screen between waves is the same as the screen after a loss in &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;.

=== Name change ===
The &quot;Defender II&quot; name was used in some home releases, due to legal issues (according to the bonus material for &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, Williams wanted to &quot;make sure they could own the trademark&quot; on the &quot;Defender&quot; name). The name &quot;Defender II&quot; has been used on many home ports and game compilation appearances, but not in arcades. The Atari 2600 port was originally sold as &quot;Stargate&quot;, but was renamed to &quot;Defender II&quot; for a later re-release.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; scored the Atari VCS version 89% in 1989. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the arcade version 82nd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; list.

==Legacy==

In July 2000, Midway licensed &quot;Defender II&quot;, along with other Williams Electronics games, to Shockwave for use in an online applet entitled &quot;Shockwave Arcade Collection&quot;, to demonstrate the power of the Shockwave web content platform. The conversion was created by Digital Eclipse. This port is no longer available.

As with &quot;Defender II&quot;, the game is included in the 2012 compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;.

===In popular culture===
A &quot;Stargate&quot; machine is featured in the 3rd-season episode &quot;Arcade&quot; of the TV comedy series &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, in which it was referred to as &quot;Stargate Defender&quot;. Eugene Jarvis, the game&#x27;s creator, had a cameo role on the episode as &quot;Delivery Guy #3&quot;.

&quot;Stargate&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Defender&quot; are featured as plot points in the podcast &quot;Rabbits&quot;.

&quot;Stargate&quot; also appeared in the 1983 film &quot;Strange Invaders&quot;.

<text>Alexander José Escobar [ess-COE-bar] (born September 6, 1978) is a Venezuelan former Major League Baseball outfielder.

==Career==
Escobar was signed by the Mets as a non-draft amateur free agent in and made his debut in . At the end of the season, he was traded to the Indians as part of an eight-player deal that sent Roberto Alomar to the Mets. Escobar missed the entire season after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during Spring Training. In , he recovered from a slow start at Triple-A Buffalo Bisons and played 28 games, collecting 24 home runs and 78 runs batted in.

In the minors, Escobar was an All-Star in the &#x27;AAA&#x27; International, &#x27;AA&#x27; Eastern, and &#x27;AA&#x27; South Atlantic leagues. He also was selected by Baseball America to join the 1998 All-Stars team.

Escobar was demoted by the Nationals during spring training after hitting just .103 (3-for-29) with two RBIs. He said he was not getting enough playing time in spring training. &quot;I&#x27;m not swinging the bat. I have to work my way back,&quot; Escobar said. &quot;I&#x27;m getting used to being on the field every day. It&#x27;s a combination of everything.&quot; Baseball America rated him as a top prospect for three years.

<doc id="715335" wikidata="Q312741" url="?curid=715335" title="Juan Díaz de Solís">
<text>Juan Díaz de Solís ( – 20 January 1516) was a 16th-century navigator and explorer. He is also said to be the first European to land on what is now modern day Uruguay.

==Biography==
His origins are disputed. One document records him as a Portuguese in the service of Castile (&quot;Spain&quot;), having possibly been born in Lisbon or São Pedro de Solis. Others claim that his birth took place in Lebrija, in what is now the province of Seville, Spain, where documentation testifies that he lived when he was in Castile, as &quot;vecino&quot; (&quot;neighbor&quot;), meaning living there. However he began his naval career in Portugal as João Dias de Solis, where he became a pilot in the Portuguese India Armadas. After leaving his home in Lisbon and the ship that he was going to sail as Pilot, in the same day of departure of the fleet (ship captained by Afonso de Albuquerque, in the 1506 armada of Tristão da Cunha, to India), accused of the death of his wife, he served as a privateer in French fleets for a short time, before serving, later, the Spanish Crown.

He served as navigator on expeditions to the Yucatán in 1506-1507 and Brazil in 1508 with Vicente Yáñez Pinzón. He became Pilot Major of Spain in 1512 following the death of Amerigo Vespucci, and was thereafter commissioned to update the Padrón Real with Juan Vespucio.

Two years after appointment to this office, Díaz de Solís prepared an expedition to explore the southern part of the new American continent. His three ships and crew of 70 men sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in Spain, on 8 October 1515. He followed the eastern coast of South America southward as far as the mouth of the Río de la Plata. He reached and named the Río de la Plata in 1516, sailing upriver to the confluence of the Uruguay River and the Paraná River with two officers and seven men. The little party had not proceeded far when they were attacked by local Charrúa Indians, but the evidence points towards it being the Guarani people who killed him. It has been suggested that he was eaten by the Charrúa after disembarking. However, the Charrúa didn&#x27;t practice cannibalism, while the Guarani Indians did. Surviving crew members reported Díaz de Solís and most of the other men had been killed, thus putting the expedition to an end. His brother-in-law, Francisco de Torres, took charge of the ships and returned to Spain.

==Honors==
Several places in Uruguay are named after Juan Díaz de Solís:
*bodies of water:
**Arroyo Solís Chico
*populated places:
**Balneario Solís
**Solís de Mataojo
*other:
**Solís Theatre, the most important theatre in Montevideo
**Route 10 Juan Díaz de Solís

<text>Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields is the largest public square in London. It was laid out in the 1630s under the initiative of the speculative builder and contractor William Newton, &quot;the first in a long series of entrepreneurs who took a hand in developing London&quot;, as Sir Nikolaus Pevsner observes. The original plan for &quot;laying out and planting&quot; these fields, drawn by the hand of Inigo Jones, was said still to be seen in Lord Pembroke&#x27;s collection at Wilton House in the 19th century, but its location is now unknown. The grounds, which had remained private property, were acquired by London County Council in 1895 and opened to the public by its chairman, Sir John Hutton, the same year. The square is today managed by the London Borough of Camden and forms part of the southern boundary of that borough with the City of Westminster.

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields takes its name from the adjacent Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, of which the private gardens are separated from the Fields by a perimeter wall and a large gatehouse.

The grassed area in the centre of the Fields contains a court for tennis and netball, and a bandstand. It was previously used for corporate events, which are no longer permitted. Cricket and other sports are thought to have been played here in the 18th century.

==History==

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn was situated in the county of Middlesex. Up to the 17th century cattle were grazed upon the fields, which were part of the Holborn grassland named Pursefield and belonged to St Giles Hospital. In the report of excavations of 64 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, it is noted that one Katherine Smyth, the owner of the White Hart Inn on Drury Lane, leased the land from 1520. It then reverted to the Crown, and was used as pasture and occasionally for an execution.

The use of the pastures meant that turnstiles were placed around the square to enable pedestrians to enter without the animals escaping. Shops and other businesses developed along these footpaths, and some of these alleys still exist – the Great and Little Turnstile.

Schemes for redevelopment of the fields by Inigo Jones and Charles Cornwallis in 1613 and 1618 were unsuccessful. William Newton gained permission, however, to erect 32 houses in what became known as Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1638 for an annual fee of £5 6s 8d. However, the building licence was only given if the central area remained an outdoor space open to the public. Quarry pits were discovered in the excavations at No. 64 (see above), probably for building materials, in particular, gravel. In the fill of one was a fragment of a &#x27;fuddling cup&#x27;, a drinking vessel which made it deliberately difficult to drink from without spillage.

When originally laid out, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields was part of fashionable London. The completion of the houses that surrounded it proceeded at a leisurely pace, interrupted by the English Civil War. In 1659 James Cooper, Robert Henley, and Francis Finch and other owners of &quot;certain parcels of ground in the fields, commonly called Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields&quot;, were exempted from all forfeitures and penalties which they might incur in regard to any new buildings they might erect on three sides of the same fields, previously to 1 October in that year, provided that they paid for the public service one year&#x27;s full value for every such house within one month of its erection; and provided that they should convey the &quot;residue of the said fields&quot; to the Society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, for laying the same into walks for common use and benefit, whereby the annoyances which formerly have been in the same fields will be taken away, and passengers there for the future better secured.&quot; The oldest building from this early period is Lindsey House, 59–60 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, which was built in 1640 and has been attributed to Inigo Jones. The builder may have been David Cunningham, 1st Baronet of Auchinhervie, a friend of the mason-sculptor Nicholas Stone, who also supervised the rebuilding of Berkhamsted Place for Charles I. It derives its name from a period of ownership in the 18th century by the earls of Lindsey.
Another seventeenth-century survival is now 66 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, which was built for Lord Powis and known as Powis House. The charter of the Bank of England was sealed there on 27 July 1694. It was in 1705 acquired by the Duke of Newcastle (whereupon it became known as Newcastle House) who had it remodelled by Sir John Vanbrugh (following earlier work by Christopher Wren after a fire in 1684). It remains substantially in its form of 1700, although a remodelling in 1930 by Edwin Lutyens gives it a curiously pastiche appearance.

As London fashion moved west, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields was left to rich lawyers who were attracted by its proximity to the Inns of Court. In this way the former Newcastle House became in 1790 the premises of the firm of solicitors Farrer &amp; Co, which is still there: their clients include Queen Elizabeth II.

The Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre was located in the Fields from 1661 to 1848, when it was demolished. This, originally called the Duke&#x27;s Theatre, was created by converting Lisle&#x27;s Tennis Court. The theatre presented the first paid public performances of Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; in 1700, John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in January 1728, and George Frideric Handel&#x27;s final two operas in 1740 and 1741.

Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields was the site, in 1683, of the public beheading of Lord William Russell, son of the first Duke of Bedford, following his implication in the Rye House Plot for the attempted assassination of King Charles II. The executioner was Jack Ketch, who made such a poor job of it that four axe blows were required before the head was separated from the body; after the first stroke, Russell looked up and said to him &quot;You dog, did I give you 10 guineas to use me so inhumanely?&quot;.

Sometime after 1735 the Fields were enclosed within an iron railing, on account of the then Master of the Rolls, Sir Joseph Jekyll, being ridden over by a horse. An alternative version of the story claims that Jekyll was attacked for his support of an Act of Parliament raising the price of gin.

From 1750 to 1992, the solicitors Frere Cholmeley were in premises on the north side of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, after which their buildings were taken over by a leading set of commercial barristers&#x27; chambers, known as Essex Court Chambers after their own former premises at 4 Essex Court in the Temple. Essex Court Chambers now occupy five buildings, nos. 24–28 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Other barristers&#x27; chambers, including leading family law chambers 1GC Family Law, have since then also set up in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, but solicitors&#x27; firms still outnumber them there.

In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;, the sinister solicitor to the aristocracy, Mr Tulkinghorn, has his offices in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, and one of its most dramatic scenes is set there. The description of his building corresponds most closely to Lindsey House. After a spell of being occupied by a firm of patent agents, Lindsey House has become home to the leading civil liberties barristers&#x27; chambers, Garden Court Chambers, together with the neighbouring building at 57–58, which includes some features designed by Sir John Soane, including a geometric staircase.

The London School of Economics and Political Science moved onto the square in 2003, taking the leasehold of 50 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, on the corner of Sardinia Street. At the end of 2008, a new £71 million state-of-the-art building housing the LSE&#x27;s Departments of Law and Management (54 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields) was opened by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Since then it has taken ownership of Sardinia House (2009), the former Land Registry building at 32 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields (2010), 44 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields (previously the home of Cancer Research), 5 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields (2016) and Nuffield House (2017), to expand to seven its portfolio of buildings on the square.

==Notable premises==
Aside from Lindsey House and Powis House, the north side of the square features Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, home of the architect, at numbers 12, 13 and 14. On the same side, at number 7, is Thomas More Chambers, led by Geoffrey Cox QC MP. Organisations with premises on the south side of the square include the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the Royal College of Surgeons (including the Hunterian Museum, in which are exhibited the intriguing medical collections of John Hunter). There is a blue plaque marking the home of the surgeon William Marsden at number 65. On the west side the Royal College of Radiologists has premises at 63 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, and the London School of Economics and Political Science owns a number of buildings. Aside from the Royal College of Surgeons, the School will then own the entire south side of the square. There is a statue by Barry Flanagan, an abstract called &quot;Camdonian&quot;, in the north-east corner of the square. Also located at 67–69 is the Centre for Commercial Law Studies, the commercial law research and teaching centre of Queen Mary, University of London.

==Homelessness==
During the 1980s Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields attracted many homeless people, who slept there overnight. In 1992, they were cleared out and fences were raised, and since the re-opening of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields with its new railings in 1993, gates have been locked every night at dusk.

During the 2008 Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Muslims attended the Fields at sunset to feed the homeless.

<doc id="715342" wikidata="Q5337563" url="?curid=715342" title="Edgardo Alfonzo">
<text>Edgardo Antonio Alfonzo (born November 8, 1973), nicknamed &quot;Fonzie&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder and coach. He played Major League Baseball (MLB) as an infielder from to , most notably as a member of the New York Mets, for whom he played in the 2000 World Series and was chosen as a member of the National League All-Star team. Alfonzo&#x27;s 29.7 wins above replacement (WAR) as a Met place him as the seventh most valuable player in franchise history.

Alfonzo also played for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Toronto Blue Jays and Navegantes del Magallanes from the LVBP. After his major league career, he played in the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol in 2008 for the Tigres de Quintana Roo then, played for one season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) with the Yomiuri Giants in . When his playing career ended, Alfonzo became a coach and later, the manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. In 2020, Alfonzo was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Alfonzo was raised in Soapire, Venezuela by mother Mercedes Porfiria, a preschool teacher, and father Edgar Alfonzo Sr., a truck driver. Alfonzo&#x27;s older brother, Edgar Jr., taught him to play baseball. Edgar signed with the California Angels in 1985 when he was 18 years old and Alfonzo was 11. Edgar sent his baseball paychecks back home so that their father did not have to spend time away from the rest of the family driving a truck.

==Playing career==
===New York Mets===
Alfonzo was signed by the Mets as an undrafted free agent in . That year he joined the Gulf Coast League Mets. The following season Alfonzo moved up and split time with the short-season &quot;A&quot; Pittsfield Mets of the New York–Penn League and Class &quot;A&quot; Florida State League St. Lucie Mets in . Alfonzo returned to St. Lucie the next season and played for them in . In , he was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class &quot;AA&quot; Eastern League and led the team in home runs and RBI. 
Alfonzo made his Major League debut on April 26, 1995. At the beginning, he was a semi-regular fielder, splitting time at second base, shortstop, and third base with several others. During his rookie season, Alfonzo spent most of his time at third base while accumulating a .310 batting average after the mid-season break. In and , he started regularly on third. After the 1998 season, the Mets signed third baseman Robin Ventura, and Alfonzo was forced to move to second base. While he was upset about the move at first, he became one of the best defensive second baseman in the league from –. Alfonzo was part of the infield considered to be among the best infields in MLB history on a cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, along with Rey Ordóñez, Robin Ventura, and John Olerud. Before the season, the Mets signed the aging Roberto Alomar, and despite Alfonzo&#x27;s tremendous offensive and defensive contributions during the previous three seasons, he was forced to move back to third base. He remained strong defensively; however, he struggled on offense, and the Mets decided not to re-sign him.
Alfonzo had his first opportunity to display his clutch hitting ability to a nationwide audience in the 1999 playoffs. After finishing in a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Wild Card, the Mets played a one-game playoff to decide who would go on to the division series. In his first at bat of the game, Alfonzo hit a two-run home run over the center field fence, providing the Mets with all the offense they would need as Al Leiter threw a complete-game shutout. On the very next night, the Mets played the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first game of the Division Series. Facing the feared Randy Johnson, Alfonzo again homered in his first at bat of the game, this time launching a two-run shot to center field. In the ninth inning of the same game, with the score deadlocked at 4–4, Alfonzo launched a grand slam down the left field line to help seal the victory for the Mets.

In , playing against the San Francisco Giants in the Division Series, Alfonzo hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning of game two, which would prove to be of immense importance as J. T. Snow launched a three-run homer in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game. The Mets would eventually win the game 5–4 in ten innings. In game three of the series, with the Mets trailing 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth inning, the Giants brought in their dominant closer Robb Nen, who had not blown a save since the All-Star break. Alfonzo responded by lining a ball down the left-field line for a double to drive in Lenny Harris. Benny Agbayani would later homer in the thirteenth inning to win the game for New York. Alfonzo then batted .444 against the Cardinals in the NLCS, but batted just .143 in the World Series against the New York Yankees. Alfonzo&#x27;s knack for clutch hitting had endeared him to many Met fans, who still consider him one of the all-time Met greats.

Coming off two excellent seasons in which he batted .304 and .324, Alfonzo had every reason to expect a big year in 2001. He had his best power numbers in 1999 (27 home runs, 108 RBI, 41 doubles) and 2000 (25, 94, 40), and at 27, he was at an age in which many hitters have their best season. However, Alfonzo suffered from a variety of injuries, including sore right hand, knee, thigh, and a back injury from years before, costing him playing time and lowering his stats to a .243 average, 17 HR, and 49 RBI in 2001. He finished with a .308 average, 16 HR, and 56 RBI. He was signed by the San Francisco Giants as a free agent in the off-season.

===San Francisco Giants===
In , Alfonzo struggled for most of the first half for the Giants. He was hitting .216 with 27 RBI at mid-season, but he hit .306 with 54 RBI the rest of the way, and performed well against the Florida Marlins in the National League Division Series, when he hit .529 (9-for-17) with five RBI. He had the lowest range factor among Major League third basemen (2.46).

Alfonzo enjoyed a slight career renaissance in hitting for his career average, although with reduced power numbers. But his career continued its downward trend in 2005 due to age, nagging injuries, and reduced playing time in favor of Pedro Feliz.

===Los Angeles Angels===
The Los Angeles Angels acquired Alfonzo in exchange for Steve Finley. As a member of the Angels, Alfonzo&#x27;s playing time further decreased in favor of younger players. After hitting .100 for the season in late May, the Angels released Alfonzo, whose agent had gone public in demands for a trade for lack of playing time, on May 20.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On May 26, 2006, Edgardo signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays and was soon called up to Toronto to help the Jays&#x27; injury- and error-riddled middle infield. He was released on June 12, after appearing in only 12 games for Toronto.

===Bridgeport Bluefish===
In July 2006, Alfonzo signed a contract with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

===New York Mets (second stint)===
After appearing in a small number of games with the Bluefish, Alfonzo&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Mets on July 15, 2006. Alfonzo reported to the then-Mets Triple-A affiliate Norfolk Tides with hopes of making it back to New York.

===Long Island Ducks===
In February , Alfonzo returned to the ALPB, signing with the Long Island Ducks.

===Texas Rangers===
On December 14, 2007, Alfonzo signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. After getting reassigned to minor league camp, Alfonzo was released before the season on March 27, 2008, and signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo in Liga Mexicana de Beisbol.

===Long Island Ducks (second stint)===
On June 9, 2008, Alfonzo signed with the Long Island Ducks.

===Yomiuri Giants===
In February , Alfonzo signed a one-year contract with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan&#x27;s Central League.

He was released by the Giants on December 2, 2009.

===Newark Bears===
In 2010 Alfonzo signed a contract with the Newark Bears, reuniting him with his former Mets teammate Armando Benítez.

===Chicago White Sox===
In 2012, the Chicago White Sox signed Alfonzo and assigned him to the Charlotte Knights.

==Coaching career==
Alfonzo began serving as the Bench Coach for the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2014 under Tom Gamboa. He originally coached home games and select road games in 2014, before coaching all games in 2015 and 2016. In addition to that role, he served as a roving instructor with the Mets. On January 5, 2017, the Cyclones announced that Alfonzo replaced Gamboa, who had retired from baseball.

Alfonzo led the Brooklyn Cyclones to a New York - Penn League Championship victory on September 10, 2019. This occurred 18 years to the day since the Cyclones won a championship game. The 2001 Brooklyn Cyclones were managed by his brother, Edgar Alfonzo. On October 17, 2019, the Mets informed Alfonzo that his contract to manage the Cyclones would not be renewed.

On January 27, 2022, he was announced as the first manager of the Staten Island FerryHawks. The team finished with a 48–84 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. Alfonzo was not retained following the season.

==Personal life==
Alfonzo&#x27;s older brother, Edgar, played in the minor leagues for 12 seasons. He has managed the Kingsport Mets, Brooklyn Cyclones, Savannah Sand Gnats and St. Lucie Mets. Another brother, Roberto, also played in 70 minor league games in the Mets farm system in 1993–94. A nephew, Giovanny, was selected in the 21st round of the 2015 MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins. Another nephew, Edgar Jr., also played minor league baseball.

Alfonzo&#x27;s son Daniel was selected by the Mets in the 38th round of the 2017 MLB Draft out of Bayside High School in Queens, New York.

<doc id="715347" wikidata="Q1976016" url="?curid=715347" title="Tuberoinfundibular pathway">
<text>The tuberoinfundibular pathway refers to a population of dopamine neurons that project from the arcuate nucleus ( the &quot;infundibular nucleus&quot;) in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus to the median eminence. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. Dopamine released at this site inhibits the secretion of prolactin from anterior pituitary gland lactotrophs by binding to dopamine receptor D2.

Some antipsychotic drugs block dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can cause an increase in the amount of prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinemia).

==Other dopamine pathways==
Other major dopamine pathways include:
* Mesocortical pathway
* Mesolimbic pathway
* Nigrostriatal pathway

* Antipsychotic

<doc id="715365" wikidata="Q1248279" url="?curid=715365" title="Euclid and His Modern Rivals">
<text>Euclid and His Modern Rivals is a mathematical book published in 1879 by the English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898), better known under his literary pseudonym &quot;Lewis Carroll&quot;. It considers the pedagogic merit of thirteen contemporary geometry textbooks, demonstrating how each in turn is either inferior to or functionally identical to Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

In it Dodgson supports using Euclid&#x27;s geometry textbook &quot;The Elements&quot; as the geometry textbook in schools against more modern geometry textbooks that were replacing it, advocated by the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching, satirized in the book as the &quot;Association for the Improvement of Things in General&quot;. Euclid&#x27;s ghost returns in the play to defend his book against its modern rivals and tries to demonstrate how all of them are inferior to his book.

Despite its scholarly subject and content, the work takes the form of a whimsical dialogue, principally between a mathematician named Minos (taken from Minos, judge of the underworld in Greek mythology) and a &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; named Professor Niemand (German for &#x27;nobody&#x27;) who represents the &quot;Modern Rivals&quot; of the title.

A quote from the preface of this book was used in the , which was kept in use for eight months, during the course of 2001. Due to the fisheye effect, only part of the text can be read:

<doc id="715370" wikidata="Q338123" url="?curid=715370" title="Samuel ibn Tibbon">
<text>Samuel ben Judah [[ibn Tibbon]] ( 1150 – c. 1230), more commonly known as Samuel ibn Tibbon (, ), was a Jewish philosopher and doctor who lived and worked in Provence, later part of France. He was born about 1150 in Lunel (Languedoc), and died about 1230 in Marseilles. He is best known for his translations of Jewish rabbinic literature from Arabic to Hebrew. Samuel ibn Tibbon wrote his own philosophical works, including &quot;Sefer ha-Mikhtav&quot; (The Book of the Letter), which dealt with ethics and spirituality. Samuel ibn Tibbon&#x27;s translations and commentaries had a significant impact on Jewish thought and scholarship during the Middle Ages. They helped to disseminate the ideas of Greek philosophy and Islamic science throughout the Jewish world, and they also contributed to the development of Jewish philosophy in their own right.

==Biography==
He received a Jewish education in rabbinic literature from his father Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon. Other teachers in Lunel taught him about medicine, Arabic and the secular knowledge of his age.

Samuel ibn Tibbon married and had children, including a son, Moses ibn Tibbon, who also translated works from Arabic to Hebrew. Later in his life, he lived in several cities of southern France (1199 in Béziers, and 1204 in Arles).

He traveled to Barcelona, Toledo, and Alexandria (1210–1213). Finally he settled in Marseilles. After his death, his body was transported to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and he is buried in Tiberias.

==Original writings==
In 1213, while returning from Alexandria, Samuel ibn Tibbon wrote on shipboard &quot;Biur meha-Millot ha-Zarot,&quot; an explanation of the philosophical terms of &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; by Maimonides.

When finishing his Hebrew translation of the Guide (originally written in Arabic), Samuel wrote an alphabetical glossary of the foreign words that he had used in his translation. In the introduction to the glossary, he divided these words into five classes:
# Words taken mainly from the Arabic;
# Rare words occurring in the Mishnah and in the Gemara;
# Hebrew verbs and adjectives derived from substantives by analogy with the Arabic;
# Homonyms, used with special meanings; and
# Words to which new meanings were given by analogy with the Arabic.

He gives also a list of corrections which he desired to be made in the copies of his translation of the &quot;Guide.&quot; The glossary gives not only a short explanation of each word and its origin, but also in many cases a scientific definition with examples.

Samuel wrote a commentary on the whole Bible, but only the following portions are known:
* &quot;Ma&#x27;amar Yikkawu ha-Mayim&quot;, a philosophical treatise in twenty-two chapters on Gen. i. 9. It deals with physical and metaphysical subjects, interpreting in an allegoric-philosophical manner the Bible verses cited by the author. At the end of the treatise, the author says that he wrote it in response to the propagation of philosophy among Gentiles and the ignorance of his coreligionists in philosophical matters.
* A philosophical commentary on Ecclesiastes, quoted by Samuel in the foregoing work (p. 175), and of which several manuscripts are extant.
* A commentary on the Song of Solomon. Quotations from this work are found in his commentary on Ecclesiastes; in Neubauer, &quot;Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.&quot; No. 1649, 2, fol. 21; and in his son&#x27;s commentary on the Song of Solomon. These make it evident that Samuel wrote this commentary, but its full contents are unknown.

Samuel ibn Tibbon was an enthusiastic adherent of Maimonides and his allegorical interpretation of the Bible. He held that many Bible narratives are to be considered simply as parables (&quot;meshalim&quot;) and the religious laws as guides (&quot;hanhagot&quot;) to a higher, spiritual life. While such statements were not unusual in his age, adherents of the literal interpretation of the Bible, the anti-Maimonidean party (see Maimonides for more details), created strong opposition to the work.

==Translations==
Samuel&#x27;s reputation is based not on his original writings, but on his translations, especially that of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; in 1204. (An image of his work may be seen online at the World Digital Library.) (The Hebrew translation is &quot;Moreh Nevukhim&quot;). Opponents of Maimonides used a satirical title: &quot;Nevukhat ha-Morim&quot;, or &quot;Perplexity of the Rebellious&quot;.

Before finishing this difficult work, Samuel consulted Maimonides several times by letter regarding some difficult passages. Maimonides responded sometimes in Arabic; his letters were later translated into Hebrew, perhaps by Samuel. He praised the translator&#x27;s ability and acknowledged his command of Arabic, a skill he found surprising in France. Maimonides gave some general rules for translation from the Arabic into Hebrew, and explained passages questioned by Samuel by writing in Hebrew.

Samuel ibn Tibbon&#x27;s translation is preceded by an introduction. He said that he wrote the translation because the Jewish scholars of Lunel had asked for it. As aids in his work, he used the Hebrew translation by his father (whom he calls &quot;the Father of the Translators&quot;), works on the Arabic language, and the Arabic writings in his own library. Samuel also prepared an index of the Biblical verses quoted in the &quot;Moreh.&quot;

A new, modern edition of ibn Tibbon&#x27;s translation was published in 2019 by Feldheim Publishers. Punctuation and paragraph breaks were added, as well as translation of difficult words at the bottom of the page. There is also an extended introduction, many new indexes and other additions.

==Characteristics of his works==
The distinction of Samuel&#x27;s translation is its accuracy and faithfulness to the original. Some critics have been concerned that he introduced a number of Arabic words into Hebrew, and, by analogy with the Arabic, he gives to certain Hebrew words meanings different from the accepted ones. But generally the scope and success of his work are not questioned. Especially admirable is the skill with which he reproduces in Hebrew the abstract ideas of Maimonides, as Hebrew is essentially a language of a people expressing concrete ideas.

When the struggle between the Maimonists and anti-Maimonists arose, Samuel was reproached for contributing to the spread of the ideas of Maimonides. His chief critic was Judah al-Fakhkhar.

Samuel translated the following works of Maimonides:
# A treatise on Resurrection under the Hebrew title &quot;&quot;Iggeret&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;amar Tehhiyath ha-Metim&quot;&quot;;
# Mishnah commentary on Pirkei Avoth, including the psychological introduction, entitled &quot;Shemonah Perakim&quot; (the Eight Chapters);
# Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Thirteen articles of faith&quot; (originally part of his Mishnah commentary on tractate Sanhedrin, 10th chapter)
# A letter to his pupil Joseph ibn &#x27;Aḳnin,

Samuel also translated the following works of other Arabic authors:
# &#x27;Ali ibn Ridwan&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Ars Parva&quot; of Galen (according to Paris MS. 1114), finished in 1199 in Béziers
# Three smaller treatises of Averroes, under the title &quot;Sheloshah Ma&#x27;amarim&quot; (edited by J. Herez, with German translation: &quot;Drei Abhandlungen über die Conjunction des Separaten Intellects mit den Menschen von Averroes, aus dem Arabischen Uebersetzt von Samuel ibn Tibbon,&quot; Berlin, 1869). Samuel translated these three treatises both as an appendix to his commentary on Ecclesiastes (see above) and separately (Steinschneider, ibid p. 199).
# Yahya ibn al-Batriq&#x27;s Arabic translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteora&quot;, under the title &quot;Otot ha-Shamayim&quot; (also quoted under the title &quot;Otot &#x27;Elyonot&quot;), translated on a voyage from Alexandria, between the two islands Lampedusa and Pantellaria. It is extant in several manuscripts. The preface and the beginning of the text have been printed by Filipowski (c. 1860) as a specimen. Samuel made this retranslation, at the request of Joseph ben Israel of Toledo, working from a single and bad Arabic translation of Batriq (Steinschneider, ibid p. 132.).

<doc id="715373" wikidata="Q985828" url="?curid=715373" title="Marine Drive, Mumbai">
<text>Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a banana-shaped, six-lane concrete road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road links Nariman Point at the southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at the northern tip. Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot; because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the streetlights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.
The official name for this road, though rarely used, is &quot;Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road&quot;. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down the road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra.

Most of the buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an art deco style, which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the earliest art deco buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver Mahal and Keval Mahal, which are also part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site - Victorian Gothic &amp; Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai. These buildings were constructed between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1 million rupees.

Real estate prices along the esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the &quot;Oberoi Hilton Tower&quot; however reverted to the original name as of early 2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of the city.

Many sports clubs, some cricket stadiums and club grounds are situated along the stretch of Marine Drive, including members-only clubs like the Cricket Club of India (CCI), adjoining the Brabourne Stadium, Hindu Gymkhana Ground and Garware Club House, adjacent to the famous Wankhede Stadium, as well as others like the Mumbai Police Gymkhana, Hindu Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana and Islam Gymkhana.

A well known actress and singer from the 1950s, Suraiya lived in a building on the stretch known as &#x27;Krishna Mahal&#x27; in the ground-floor apartment (as a tenant of Shah family) from the 1940s until her death on 31 January 2004. The house was first rented by her mother, Mumtaz Begum. Many other film stars, such as Nargis and Raj Kapoor, lived nearby in the 1940s and 50s.

In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid. A number of bollards were also installed as there was nothing to prevent accidents or attacks. A few years earlier, the footpaths were renovated.

<text>Henry Ramón Blanco (born August 29, 1971) is a Venezuelan professional baseball coach and former player. He is currently the catching and strategy coach for the Washington Nationals. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1997 to 2013, appearing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, and Seattle Mariners. He later served as quality assurance coach for the Cubs. Although a light-hitting player, he was regarded as one of the best defensive catchers of his era.

==Professional career==
Blanco began his professional baseball career in 1989 when, he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. He didn&#x27;t begin to play as a catcher until . After 7 years in the minor leagues, he finally blossomed in when he hit for a .313 batting average in 91 games for the Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League. At the age of 25, Blanco made his major league debut with the Dodgers on July 25, 1997. He returned to play for Albuquerque in and was granted free agency in October of that year.

In December 1998, Blanco signed a contract to play for the Colorado Rockies and won the starting catcher&#x27;s role for the 1999 season. Hitting for a .232 batting average, he embellished his defensive credentials by leading National League catchers with 39 baserunners caught stealing. In December 1999, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers as part of a three-team trade. Blanco caught the majority of the Brewers&#x27; games in 2000, posting a .236 batting average with 7 home runs, 31 runs batted in. He led National League catchers with a 58.2% baserunners caught stealing percentage, the highest percentage since when Bob Boone also had a 58.2% success rate. His batting average fell to .210 in the 2001 season and, in March 2002, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Paul Bako and José Cabrera.

While Blanco served as a reserve catcher with the Braves working behind Javy Lopez, he also became known as Greg Maddux&#x27; personal catcher, a role he inherited from fellow Venezuelan catcher, Eddie Pérez. Although he only produced 22 runs batted in, he had 5 game-winning RBIs and provided solid defense, helping the Braves win the National League Eastern Division title. Blanco was the starting catcher for the Braves in Game 3 of the 2002 National League Division Series and was a late-inning replacement in Game 5 as the Braves were defeated by the San Francisco Giants. In January , Blanco signed a $1.3 million, one-year contract with the Braves.

The Braves repeated as Eastern Division champions in 2003 however, Blanco&#x27;s batting average dropped to .199 and he was left off the post-season roster in favor of catcher Johnny Estrada as, the Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs in the 2003 National League Division Series. When the Braves assigned him to the Triple-A Richmond Braves at the end of the season, Blanco opted for free agency and, in December 2003, he signed a one-year, $750,000 contract to play for the Minnesota Twins.

Blanco became a valuable member of the Twins when rookie catcher Joe Mauer was injured early in the 2004 season. He was credited for helping the Twins pitching staff with his game-calling skills, guiding them to the lowest team earned run average in the league. Twins pitcher, Johan Santana, gave Blanco credit for helping him win the American League Cy Young Award. He caught the majority of the Twins&#x27; games helping them to clinch the American League Central division title. Blanco posted career-highs with 10 home runs and 37 runs batted in, while leading the American League catchers with a 49.2% caught stealing percentage. He started all four games of the 2004 American League Division Series, hitting 1 home run along with a .250 batting average as the Twins lost to the New York Yankees.

After failing to reach a contract agreement with the Twins after the season, Blanco opted for free agency again and, in December 2004 he signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract to play for the Chicago Cubs. He worked as a backup catcher to Michael Barrett although, many of the Cubs pitchers preferred pitching to Blanco as his 2005 catcher&#x27;s earned run average of 3.58 was almost 1 run lower than the 4.45 average posted by Barrett.

In the 2006 Caribbean Series, Blanco had a walk off double off the top of the opposing shortstop&#x27;s head in the championship game to give the Leones del Caracas the series championship win over the Tigres del Licey. In the 2006 major league season, he hit for a .266 batting average with a career-high 37 runs batted in and, in November, signed a two-year contract for $5.25 million to remain with the Cubs. Blanco appeared in only 22 games for the Cubs in 2007, missing two months of the season due to a herniated disc. The Cubs went on to win the National League Central division although, Blanco did not appear in any post-season games. In 2008, Blanco hit a career-high .292 while serving as backup and mentor to rookie catcher Geovany Soto, who went on to win the National League Rookie of the Year Award.

After the 2008 season, Blanco&#x27;s option was declined making him a free agent. In January 2009, he signed a $750,000, one-year contract to play for the San Diego Padres. During the 2009 season, he was a pinch-hitter, late-inning defensive replacement, and a mentor for Padres starting catcher Nick Hundley. Blanco signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the New York Mets on December 3, 2009. On May 8, 2010, Blanco hit a walk-off home run to help the Mets defeat the San Francisco Giants 5–4.

Blanco signed a one-year contract on December 15, 2010, with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He played in 37 games, hitting .250 and was re-signed following the season. He played in 21 games in the 2012 season.

Blanco signed a non-guaranteed contract on January 11, 2013, with the Toronto Blue Jays. Blanco made the opening day roster for Toronto as the batterymate to recently acquired 2012 NL Cy Young winner R. A. Dickey. Blanco and Dickey previously played together for the New York Mets during the 2010 season, and Dickey had said Blanco was &quot;the best [Dickey&#x27;s] had seen at catching the knuckleball&quot;. Blanco was designated for assignment on June 7, 2013, and released on June 10. He batted .184 with the Blue Jays in 15 games played, with no home runs or RBI.
Blanco was signed by the Seattle Mariners on June 14, 2013, to be a mentor to Mike Zunino. In Blanco&#x27;s first game with the Mariners on June 15 (against the Oakland Athletics), he hit a grand slam down the left field line. On July 25, Zunino broke his left hand, and Blanco began splitting the catching duties with recently signed Humberto Quintero. On August 1, 2013, Blanco hit his second grand slam since becoming a Mariner. This one also down the left field line, against the Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Ryan Dempster which gave the Mariners a 7–1 lead, but the bullpen allowed seven runs in the final two innings in an 8–7 loss.

In 35 games with the Mariners, Blanco hit .125/.215/.240 with 3 HR and 14 RBI, while throwing out 6 of 16 would-be base stealers. He played in his final major league game on September 23, 2013, at the age of 41. He was designated for assignment on October 8, 2013, after the Mariners claimed outfield prospect Travis Witherspoon off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels. He elected free agency the next day.

==Career statistics==
In a sixteen-year major league career, Blanco played in 971 games, accumulating 615 hits in 2,761 at bats for a .223 career batting average along with 72 home runs, 298 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .288. Blanco&#x27;s .994 career fielding percentage ranks 27th all-time among major league catchers. Although he was a light-hitter, Blanco had an extended major league career due to the value of his excellent defensive abilities. He has credited former catcher Mike Scioscia, who was the catching coordinator during his time with the Dodgers, with helping him develop his catching skills.

==Coaching==
Blanco signed a minor-league contract, with an invitation to spring training, with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 13, 2013. He was released on March 31, 2014, and immediately re-joined the Diamondbacks as a coach. On November 22, 2014, Blanco was hired by the Chicago Cubs to be their quality assurance coach. He won the 2016 World Series with the Cubs as a coach. After three seasons as a Chicago coach, Blanco joined former Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez on the staff of the Washington Nationals as the team&#x27;s bullpen coach. His hiring was announced November 15, 2017. On November 4, 2021, Blanco was transitioned to the role of catching and strategy coach.

Blanco made his managerial debut with the Bravos de Margarita club of the Venezuelan League in the 2014–2015 season.

<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, also commonly known as St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Episcopal Church in the United States located in the State of Hawaii. Originally the seat of the Anglican Church of Hawaii, it is now the home of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii. It is affiliated with St. Andrew&#x27;s Schools, which consists of the main girls&#x27; K-12 school, the coeducational Queen Emma Preschool and a boys&#x27; preparatory school (elementary).

==History==
Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, his queen consort, were devout members of the Church of England led by their good friend Queen Victoria. At their request, Thomas Nettleship Staley was appointed bishop in 1862. Inspired to build a place of worship in the Anglican tradition, Kamehameha IV commissioned the construction of what would later become the Cathedral of Saint Andrew. However, the king died on the feast day of Saint Andrew in 1863 before ground-breaking. Kamehameha V, the king&#x27;s brother, took over the project and laid the cornerstone in honor of his predecessor on March 5, 1867. The cathedral was designed by the London architects William Slater and R. H. Carpenter, and the building process was overseen by their chief assistant Benjamin Ingelow.

The Cathedral of Saint Andrew was built in the French Gothic architectural style, shipped in several pre-fabricated pieces from England. The western facade has a window of hand-blown stained glass that reaches from the floor to the eaves, depicting the European explorers that visited the Hawaiian Islands.

There are only three other cathedrals in the Hawaiian Islands — Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Pacific of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.

It is located on Queen Emma Street, between Beretania Street and Queen Emma Square.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on July 2, 1973 as site 73000663.

==Bells==
The Mackintosh Tower, completed in 1912, contains a set of eight bells hung for change ringing, and is the westernmost such tower in the United States and the world. The current bells, which predate the cathedral, came from St. Alkmund&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury, United Kingdom. They were cast in 1812 by John Briant (1748-1829), a bellfounder based in Hertford. They went unrung for many years due to that church&#x27;s structural issues, and in 1972, facing redundancy, the bells were put up for sale. In 1990, the bells were removed from St Alkmund&#x27;s Church to John Taylor &amp; Co, who refurbished and retuned the bells to F♯. The bells, at the request of the donor, were also inscribed with the names of the Hawaiian monarchs. They were installed in 1991.

<doc id="715379" wikidata="Q4103819" url="?curid=715379" title="Variadic macro in the C preprocessor">
<text>A variadic macro is a feature of some computer programming languages, especially the C preprocessor, whereby a macro may be declared to accept a varying number of arguments. 

Variable-argument macros were introduced in 1999 in the &quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1999&quot; (C99) revision of the C language standard, and in 2011 in &quot;ISO/IEC 14882:2011&quot; (C++11) revision of the C++ language standard. Support for variadic macros with no arguments was added in C++20 and will be added in C23.

== Declaration syntax ==
The declaration syntax is similar to that of variadic functions: a sequence of three full stops &quot;&quot; is used to indicate that one or more arguments must be passed. During macro expansion each occurrence of the special identifier in the macro replacement list is replaced by the passed arguments.

Additionally, regular macro arguments may be listed before the codice_1, but regular arguments may not be listed after the codice_1.

No means is provided to access individual arguments in the variable argument list, nor to find out how many were passed. However, macros can be written to count the number of arguments that have been passed.

Both the C99 and C++11 standards require at least one argument, but since C++20 this limitation has been lifted through the functional macro. The macro is replaced by its argument when arguments are present, and omitted otherwise. Common compilers also permit passing zero arguments before this addition, however.

The C preprocessor rules prevent macro names in the argument of from expanding recursively. It is possible to work around this limitation up to an arbitrary fixed number of recursive expansions, however.

== Support ==
Several compilers support variable-argument macros when compiling C and C++ code: the GNU Compiler Collection 3.0, Clang (all versions), Visual Studio 2005, C++Builder 2006, and Oracle Solaris Studio (formerly Sun Studio) Forte Developer 6 update 2 (C++ version 5.3). GCC also supports such macros when compiling Objective-C.

Support for the macro to support zero arguments has been added in GNU Compiler Collection 8, Clang 6, and Visual Studio 2019.

== Example ==
If a codice_3-like function were desired, which would take the file and line number from which it was called as arguments, the following solution applies.
 could then be called as

dbgprintf (&quot;Hello, world&quot;);

which expands to

realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, &quot;Hello, world&quot;);
Another example is

dbgprintf(&quot;%d + %d = %d&quot;, 2, 2, 5);

which expands to

realdbgprintf(__FILE__, __LINE__, &quot;%d + %d = %d&quot;, 2, 2, 5);
Without variadic macros, writing wrappers to codice_3 is not directly possible. The standard workaround is to use the stdargs functionality of C/C++, and have the function call codice_5 instead.

== Trailing comma ==
There is a portability issue with generating a trailing comma with empty args for variadic macros in C99. Some compilers (e.g., Visual Studio when not using the new standard-conformant preprocessor) will silently eliminate the trailing comma. Other compilers (e.g.: GCC) support putting in front of codice_6.
# define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...) fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s(%u): &quot; FormatLiteral &quot;\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__)

The following application works

MYLOG(&quot;Too many balloons %u&quot;, 42);

which expands to

fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s(%u): &quot; &quot;Too many balloons %u&quot; &quot;\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, 42);

which is equivalent to

fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s(%u): Too many balloons %u\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, 42);

But look at this application:

MYLOG(&quot;Attention!&quot;);

which expands to

fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s(%u): &quot; &quot;Attention!&quot; &quot;\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, );

which generates a syntax error with GCC.

GCC supports the following (non-portable) extension:

# define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...) fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s(%u): &quot; FormatLiteral &quot;\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__)

which removes the trailing comma when codice_6 is empty.

C23 solves this problem by introducing codice_6 like C++.

== Alternatives ==
Before the existence of variable-arguments in C99, it was quite common to use doubly nested parentheses to exploit the variable number of arguments that could be supplied to the function:
#define dbgprintf(x) realdbgprintf x

 could then be called as:

dbgprintf ((&quot;Hello, world %d&quot;, 27));

which expands to:

realdbgprintf (&quot;Hello, world %d&quot;, 27);

<doc id="715396" wikidata="Q372479" url="?curid=715396" title="Alan Cunningham">
<text>General Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham, (1 May 1887 – 30 January 1983), was a senior officer of the British Army noted for his victories over Italian forces in the East African Campaign during the Second World War. He then commanded Eighth Army in the desert campaign, but was relieved of command during the &quot;Crusader&quot; battle against Erwin Rommel. Later he served as the seventh and last High Commissioner of Palestine. He was the younger brother of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cunningham of Hyndhope.

==Early life and military career==
Cunningham was born in Dublin, Ireland, the third son of Scottish Professor Daniel John Cunningham and his wife Elizabeth Cumming Browne. He was educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before taking a commission in the Royal Artillery in 1906. In 1909, his father died unexpectedly and Cunningham was applied to join the British Indian Army as he could no longer afford the life style of an officer in Britain. At the out break of the First World War, he was deployed to France with the Indian Expeditionary Force. However, in 1915 he was transferred back to the Royal Artillery, due to a shortage in trained officers. He was awarded a Military Cross in 1915 and the Distinguished Service Order in 1918, he was also awarded three Mention in dispatches during the War. He had served as a Howitzer Battery Commander and had was the Artillery brigade major for 20th (Light) Division in June 1917. For two years after the war he served as a staff officer in the Straits Settlements. He went on to have a number of regimental duty posts, including a tour in Egypt in 1925. He was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel whilst conducting the post of chief Instructor at the Anti-Aircraft wing at the Small Arms School in Netheravon and was appointed Commanding Officer of 1st Medium Brigade Royal Artillery in Portsmouth in 1935.

After graduating from the Royal Naval College, Greenwich in 1925, followed by the Imperial Defence Studies in 1937, Cunningham was appointed as the Commander, Royal Artillery of the 1st Infantry Division. However he never took up this post as he was promoted in 1938 by promotion to major-general and given the task of forming and commanding of the 5th Anti-Aircraft Division. Cunningham&#x27;s headquarters was in Reading and the Division covered Bristol, Portsmouth and Southampton. This area of operation in South-West England was aligned with the RAF 10 Group.

==Second World War==

After Dunkirk, Cunningham was moved from 5th Anti-Aircraft initially to reform the 4th (Infantry) Division, but this was quickly changed and he was ordered to form and train the 66th Infantry Division, in Manchester. He was the moved to Scotland to command the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division, and renamed it 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, when the majority of that Division was lost in the withdrawal from France. At 3 days notice he was informed that he was to take command of the East Africa Force in Kenya and was promoted to acting lieutenant general.

During the East African Campaign General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Command, directed Cunningham to retake British Somaliland and free Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from the Italians whilst forces under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir William Platt would attack from Sudan in the north through Eritrea. Cunningham commanded three divisions in East Africa Force, the 1st (South African) Division commanded by Major General George Brink, the 11th (African) Division commanded by Major General Harry Edward de Robillard Wetherall and the 12th (African) Division commanded by Major General Reade Godwin-Austen . Cunningham&#x27;s offensive started with the Battle of the Juba prior to which he issued his famous order of the day &#x27;Hit them. Hit them hard and hit them again&#x27;. The Indian Ocean port of Kismayu () was quickly captured and Cunningham realized that the Italians had no depth to their defence. He therefore ordered a rapid advance to Mogadishu (Italian: Mogadiscio) by the 23rd Nigerian Brigade who covered 275 miles in just three days. When General Wavell asked Cunningham when he might capture Mogadishu he simply replied &#x27;got it&#x27;. The Italians were then pursued and fought a number of covering actions at the Marda Pass and the River Awash. On 6 April 1941, Cunningham&#x27;s forces entered Addis Ababa having advanced 1,687 miles at an average rate of 75 miles a day. On the 5 May 1941, Cunningham believed it was safe for Emperor Haile Selassie to return to Addis Ababa, five years after he was forced to flee from the Italian forces. On 11 May the northernmost units of Cunningham&#x27;s forces, under South African Brigadier Dan Pienaar linked with Platt&#x27;s forces under Major-General Mosley Mayne to besiege Amba Alagi. On 20 May, Mayne took the surrender of the Duke of Aosta, at Amba Alagi. Cunningham continued to lead his forces in mopping up operations against the 40,000 Italian troops in the Galla-Sidamo region. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and awarded another Mention in Dispatches for his actions in East Africa. For this campaign he was also awarded Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar, 1st class and Order of Menelik II, 1st class by Emperor Haile Selassie and the Order of the Crown, 1st class by the King of Belgium.
His success in East Africa led to Cunningham&#x27;s appointment to form, train and command the new Eighth Army in North Africa in August 1941. The Eighth Army was to consist of two Corps, XIII Corps (United Kingdom) was mainly Infantry and was to be commanded by Lieutenant General Godwin-Austen, whom Cunningham had commanded in Eat Africa. XXX Corps was to be armoured and commanded by Lieutenant General Vyvyan Pope, the British armoured expert, however Pope was killed with his staff in a plane crash on 6 October 1941 and he was replaced by the inexperienced cavalry officer Major General Charles Willoughby-Norrie. Cunningham had to form and train the Eight Army in time to lead General Sir Claude Auchinleck&#x27;s Libyan Desert offensive which under pressure from Churchill was due to begin in early November, but actually began on 18 November. It was called Operation Crusader.

Cunningham&#x27;s offensive achieved complete surprise and the Axis were slow to react. This resulted in Willouby-Norrie convincing Cunningham to amend the plan and allow him to strike for Tobruk. This resulted in the destruction of the British armour as it engaged the Afrika Korps as brigades, rather than Cunningham&#x27;s plan for a concentrated Eight Army fighting what Pope had termed &#x27;the Big Tank Battle&#x27;. due to the heavy looses, there was a chance that Rommel could break through to Egypt and Cunningham sought strategic advice from Auchinleck to either continue the offensive or to defend and rebuild the tank formations. Auchinleck, who had access to secret Ultra intelligence, ordered Cunningham to continue and Cunningham issued orders that XIII Corps was to take up the offensive and relieve the Siege of Tobruk. 

On 25 November, the Axis counterattack into Egypt during Crusader had been repulsed, Cunningham was dismissed by Auchinleck. His replacement was Auchinleck&#x27;s deputy chief of the general staff, Major-General Neil Ritchie, who was chosen due to his familiarity with the Operation Crusader plan, the day after he took over, XIII Corp relieved Tobruk as planned by Cunningham. Auchinleck had been content when he left Cunningham and it is likely that he was convinced by Air Marshal Arthur Tedder to replace him during the flight back to Cairo. Auchinleck asked Cunningham to go into No. 64 Field Hospital for security reasons asking him ‘to agree to being placed on the sick list and to go into hospital for a period. I know that this will be against all your instincts, and that you will hate doing it’ and Cunningham agreed. However, he had no health issues apart from being tired after fighting for 9 days as he pointed out ‘like all the troops fighting in Libya’. Once Cunningham was in hospital, Auchinleck wrote again to offer his ‘forgiveness in having inflicted this indignity on you … [I] know very well how you disliked having to pretend that you are sick, when you are not.’ Cunningham was then examined by a consultant Colonel Smallwood on the 29 November who wrote that he was ‘tired and showed signs of strain’ due to his ‘long and heavy responsibilities’ which ‘had culminated in a period of about a week with practically no sleep’, he concluded that t ‘since admission to hospital he has slept soundly each night… He is composed, and very alert and mentally active. There is no evidence of any “nervous breakdown&quot;&#x27;. However, whilst Cunningham was in isolated in hospital, the narrative of a nervous breakdown was spread and became the accepted story. 

When he return to Britain in December 1941, Churchill refused to give him a role, stating that he was either sick or incompetent, but General Alan Brooke contended that he was neither. However, when Jam Smuts came to Britain the October 1942 he convinced Churchill that Cunningham should be given a role. Cunningham, who was now a Major General again, was appointed as the Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley (1942). In 1943 he was appointed as General Officer C-in-C in Northern Ireland and promoted back to Lieutenant General. In this role he was heavily involved in preparing US troops for D Day and was awarded the Legion of Merit Medal by the US Government for this work. Finally, in 1944 he was appointed as the General Officer C-in-C Eastern Command with the tasks of both training replacements for Europe and disbanding the Home Guard. He these later posts, Cunningham gave a number of important speeches about military leadership, the eminent academic Professor John Adair (author) has said of Cunningham words that it &#x27;puts him up with Montgomery and Slim as a thinker about leadership in the military context.  He was unique, however, in lecturing on the subject actually during the Second World War, whereas they saved their thoughts until the post war years’.

==Post-war==
After the war, Cunningham, who was promoted to general on 30 October 1945, returned to the Middle East as High Commissioner of Palestine; he served in the position from 1945 to 1948. He was in charge of operations against the Hagana, a Zionist militia, Etzel and Lehi terrorists who in this period fought against the Mandate authorities and the Palestinian population, as well as Palestinian militias, with Arab armies poised to invade as soon as the British withdrew. Cunningham had retired from the army in October 1946 when he relinquished the role of Commander-in-Chief Palestine but retained the job of High Commissioner until 1948. He was awarded a second knighthood for his duties and became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.

On return to Britain, Cunningham was offered the post of Black Rod at the Palace of Westminster, but declined it and retired public life. He continued to serve however as the Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery until 1954, as a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire from 1950, as the President of the Council of Governors at Cheltenham College from 1951 until 1963. Also in 1954 he was asked to play a major role in the visit to Britain of Emperor Haile Selassie. On 5 April 1951, at the age of 61, he married Margery Snagge.

Cunningham died at the age of 95 in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. He is buried with his father and mother under a simple monument near the Dean Gallery entrance to Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.

<doc id="715400" wikidata="Q7357960" url="?curid=715400" title="Roger Cedeño">
<text>Roger Leandro Cedeño (born August 16, 1974) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder. He played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1995 to 2005 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, and St. Louis Cardinals.

==Career==
Signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an undrafted amateur free agent in , Cedeño made his major league debut in . Cedeño was slated to be the heir apparent to veteran Dodger All-Star outfielder Brett Butler. However, after four seasons of mediocre play with the Dodgers, he was traded to the New York Mets on December 1, 1998 in a deal in which the Dodgers obtained Todd Hundley. In the 1999 season, Cedeño broke a Mets record by stealing 66 bases in a season (later broken by Jose Reyes). Besides his 66 stolen bases, Cedeño would bat .313, have an on-base percentage of .396, and a slugging percentage of .408. These would all turn out to be career bests. Following the season, on December 11 the Mets traded Cedeño to the Houston Astros as part of a deal to obtain Mike Hampton.

In May 2000, Cedeño broke his hand sliding headfirst into first base and would spend three months on the disabled list. Following the season, Cedeño would be involved in a December trade for the third consecutive year, this time going to the Detroit Tigers in a six player deal. 2001 would see Cedeño bat .293 and steal 55 bases, although he led the American League by being caught stealing 15 times. That winter would be the fourth year in a row he changed teams, returning to the Mets via free agency. The next three seasons would show further declines in Cedeño&#x27;s stolen bases, 25 in 2002, 14 in 2003 and just 5 in 2004, while hitting in the .260s all three years. He was traded before the 2004 season to the St. Louis Cardinals for Wilson Delgado. Following a 2005 season that saw just 61 plate appearances, Cedeño was released by the Cardinals.

After a year off, Cedeño agreed to a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles in . He was released on March 23, 2007.

Cedeño finished his career with a .273 batting average, 40 home runs, 274 RBI and 213 stolen bases in 1100 games.

==Causes==
In 2016, Cedeno founded the Roger Cedeno Foundation in Aventura, Florida, an IRS designated 501 (c) (3) charitable organization Great Nonprofits Cedeno Foundation Profile and Fundacion Roger Cedeno in Venezuela to support organizations and programs to benefit youth and those most in need.

==Personal life==
Cedeño&#x27;s nephew, Yangervis Solarte, played infield for the San Francisco Giants. Cedeño convinced his agent to take Solarte on a client as a personal favor.

<doc id="715406" wikidata="Q1525696" url="?curid=715406" title="Ibn Tibbon">
<text>Ibn Tibbon () is a family of Jewish rabbis and translators that lived principally in Provence in the 12th and 13th centuries.

== Prominent family members ==

Prominent members of the family include:

* Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon (1120–after 1190), translator and physician.

:Born in Granada, he left Spain in 1150, probably on account of anti-Semitic persecution by the Almohades, and went to Lunel in southern France. Benjamin of Tudela mentions him as a physician there in 1160. He died around 1190, in Marseille, France.

* Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon (Lunel, 1150–Marseilles, 1230), more commonly known as Samuel ibn Tibbon, Jewish philosopher and doctor.

:Best known for his translations of Jewish rabbinic literature from Arabic to Hebrew, he was an adherent of Maimonides and his interpretation of the Bible, and is famous for his translations and writings on the philosophy of Maimonides.

* Moses ibn Tibbon (born in Marseilles; flourished between 1240 and 1283) was a Jewish physician, author, and translator.

:The number of works written by Moses ibn Tibbon makes it probable that he reached a great age. He was son of Samuel ibn Tibbon, and father of the Judah ibn Tibbon who was prominent in the Maimonidean controversy that took place at Montpellier.

* Judah ben Moses ibn Tibbon

:A rabbi in Montpellier; he took part in the dispute between the followers and the opponents of Maimonides. He induced his relative Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon to support the Maimonidean party by pointing out that the anti-Maimonideans were the opponents of his grandfather Samuel ibn Tibbon and his grandfather&#x27;s son-in-law, Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Samson ben Anatoli. In consequence of this, Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon protested against the reading of Solomon ben Adret&#x27;s letter to the community of Montpellier, which nevertheless took place in the synagogue of that city on the following day, a Sabbath, in the month of Elul, 1304. According to Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon, Judah wrote various works. None of them are extant.

* Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon, known as Prophatius, (Marseille (probably) c.1236–Montpellier, c.1304), an astronomer.

:He was a grandson of Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon. In the controversy between the Maimonists and the anti-Maimonists, Jacob defended science against the attacks of Abba Mari and his party.

== Others ==
* Samuel ibn Tibbon. The son of Moses ibn Tibbon, he is first mentioned in a responsum of Solomon ben Adret (Neubauer, in &quot;R. E. J.&quot; xii. 82 et seq.), which narrates a suit brought by Samuel against his rich young cousin Bionguda (). Bionguda was the youngest of three daughters born to Bella, the daughter of Moses ibn Tibbon. After the death of her husband, Jacob ha-Kohen (1254), Bella went to Marseille, where Bionguda became engaged to Isaac ben Isaac. Samuel ibn Tibbon, who at that time was probably living at Marseille, contested the legality of the marriage to Isaac ben Isaac, saying that he had made Bionguda his legal wife while she was still living at Naples. Bionguda denied this.
* Abraham ibn Tibbon. Translator of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot;. His exact relationship to the Tibbon family is unknown.

<doc id="715410" wikidata="Q1422154" url="?curid=715410" title="José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport">
<text>José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (; ) is an international airport serving Guayaquil, the capital of the Guayas Province and the most populous city in Ecuador. It is the second busiest airport in Ecuador.

The airport was named after José Joaquín de Olmedo, a notable Ecuadorian poet, first mayor of Guayaquil, and former president of Ecuador. It was changed from Simón Bolívar International Airport, which is currently the name of the airports in Caracas, Venezuela, and Santa Marta, Colombia.

The airport is on the Avenida de las Américas, north of Guayaquil&#x27;s centre. The runway length of includes a displaced threshold on Runway 21 and a displaced threshold on Runway 03. The runway can accommodate Boeing 747 and Airbus A340-600 aircraft. The airport is in the broad delta of the Guayas River, with level terrain in all quadrants.

In July 2014, the airport domestic area was enlarged; now the airport is capable of handling up to 7.5 million passengers per year. An exit tax is levied on all international tickets, however, it is no longer required to pay at the window when exiting the country.

==History==

The airport, which had the newest terminal in Ecuador, was renamed for José Joaquín de Olmedo in 2006, in preparation for the inauguration of the new national and international terminal on 27 July 2006. Although there was an inaugural flight on 28 July 2006, most airlines did not operate completely from the new terminal until August 2006. After that date, the old terminal was closed and it was later turned into a convention center.

The construction of the new terminal and expansion of the runway was finally decided in 2003–2004, years after making the decision that the current infrastructure was not sufficient to cover the city&#x27;s needs, but that it was not yet commercially viable to build an entirely new airport in the Daular area.

The original project in 2003–2004 contemplated the construction of a international terminal and the continuing operation of the old terminal, which would be left to handle only domestic flights. However, it was later decided that the newer terminal would handle both national and international traffic, and the older terminal would be closed.

The airport is planned to serve the city of Guayaquil for 10 to 15 years starting in 2006. After this, it is expected to reach a capacity of 5 million passengers a year, and when this happens a new airport will be built in the Daular area, some 20 kilometers outside the city, near the highway that connects Guayaquil to Salinas and other coastal towns.

José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport was named &quot;Best Airport in Latin America 2008 &amp; 2009&quot; by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; and the second best in 2011. All domestic flights going from the Ecuadorian mainland to the Galápagos Islands make a stop in Guayaquil to refuel and pick up passengers due to its location, which is the closest point in Ecuador to the islands.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 29 April 1983, SAN Flight 832, a Sud Aviation Caravelle (registered HC-BAJ) crashed near the southern end of the airport&#x27;s runway after attempting to execute an emergency landing. The plane had suffered an engine failure shortly after taking off from Guayaquil on a flight to Quito&#x27;s Mariscal Sucre Airport, and the crew was returning to the airport. However, the second engine failed while overflying the city during the return, and, being barely airborne, the plane stalled just as it approached the airport. Cap. Germán Cruz crash-landed the plane in a muddy puddle, produced by recent El Niño rains near the end of the runway, with the fuselage breaking in three parts but without causing a fire. The accident killed 8 of the 100 people on board and injured several others, but the fact that puddle served as a form of cushion helped avoid more fatalities. The pilot had previously reported engine issues and had tested the plane the previous day, after which it was subjected to maintenance and was later reported as fit to fly shortly before the ill-fated flight.

<text>The Irish Examiner, formerly The Cork Examiner and then The Examiner, is an Irish national daily newspaper which primarily circulates in the Munster region surrounding its base in Cork, though it is available throughout the country.

==History==
===19th and early 20th centuries===

The paper was founded by John Francis Maguire under the title &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; in 1841 in support of the Catholic Emancipation and tenant rights work of Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Historical copies of &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot;, dating back to 1841, are available to search and view in digitised form at the Irish Newspaper Archives website and British Newspaper Archive.

During the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War, the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; (along with other nationalist newspapers) was subject to censorship and suppression.

At the time of the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; reportedly took a strongly pro-Franco tone in its coverage of the conflict. As of the early to mid-20th century, the newspaper reportedly catered to a &quot;socially-conservative reader base&quot; and reflected a &quot;conservative nationalist agenda&quot;.

===Renaming and ownership===
Published as &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; from 1841 until 1996, the newspaper was renamed &quot;The Examiner&quot; in 1996. Since 2000 it has been published as &quot;The Irish Examiner&quot;, to appeal to a wider national readership.

The newspaper, along with &#x27;sister paper&#x27; the &quot;Evening Echo&quot;, was part of the Thomas Crosbie Holdings group. Thomas Crosbie Holdings went into receivership in March 2013. The newspaper was acquired by Landmark Media Investments.
, its chief executive was Thomas J. Murphy, and its editor was Tim Vaughan. Vaughan left the group in August 2016.

The newspaper was based at Academy Street, Cork for over a century, before moving to new offices at Lapp&#x27;s Quay, Cork in early November 2006, and subsequently to editorial offices at Blackpool, Cork, with a sales office in Oliver Plunkett Street.

===Sale to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;===
In February 2017, it was reported that Landmark Media Investments had appointed KPMG to advise on a range of options, including an Independent News and Media link with the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;.

In March 2017, it was reported that &quot;The Irish Times&quot; might bid for the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;, and by April 2017 both &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and INM had entered a sales process and signed non-disclosure agreements.

In May 2017, it was reported that Sunrise Media and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; were exploring an acquisition, and a sale was agreed to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in December 2017, pending regulatory approval. The sale to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; was completed in July 2018.

As of 2021, its editorial policy has been described as centrist or conservative; the Eurotopics website described the political orientation of the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; as liberal.

==Circulation==
Average print circulation was approximately 57,000 copies per issue in 1990, had risen to 62,000 by 1999, had decreased to 50,000 by 2009, and was approximately 28,000 by 2017. Reflecting a changing trend in newspaper sales, the &quot;Examiner&quot; markets to advertisers on the basis of its print and online audience, stating in 2017 that &quot;236,000 people read the Irish Examiner in print or online every day&quot;.

The Irish Examiner exited ABC circulation audits in 2020.

<text>&quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; is a 1930 song written by Hoagy Carmichael (1899–1981), and Stuart Gorrell (1901–1963), and first recorded that same year by Hoagy Carmichael at the RCA Victor Studios at 155 East 24th Street in Manhattan of New York City. However, the song has been most often associated with soul singer Ray Charles (1930–2004), who was a native of the U.S. state of Georgia in The South of the United States, and recorded it for his 1960 album &quot;The Genius Hits the Road&quot;.

In 1979, the State of Georgia through its General Assembly of Georgia (state legislature), designated Ray Charles&#x27; version the official state song. The song has become part of the Great American Songbook tradition.

&quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame twice. The first induction was in 1993 for the 1960 recording on the ABC-Paramount label by Ray Charles. The second induction happened in 2014 for the earlier 1930 recording on the RCA Victor label by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra.

==Background and original recording==
It has been asserted by some that composer Hoagy Carmichael wrote the song about his sister, named &quot;Georgia&quot;. However, Carmichael wrote in his second published autobiography / memoirs &quot;Sometimes I Wonder&quot; (1976), that saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer (1901–1956), told him he should write a song about the state of Georgia. Trumbauer jokingly volunteered the first two words, &quot;Georgia, Georgia...&quot;, which Carmichael ended up using while working later on the song with his roommate, Stuart Gorrell. Gorrell, who wrote the lyrics, stated however, that he wrote the lyrics about Carmichael’s sister. Gorrell&#x27;s name was absent from the copyright application papers submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, but Carmichael sent him royalty checks afterwards anyway.

Carmichael first recorded &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, with Bix Beiderbecke (1903–1931), on cornet, in New York City on September 15, 1930.

==Ray Charles version==
In 1960, Ray Charles, a native of Georgia, recorded a version of the song that went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Hot 100. Charles&#x27; hit rendition would become the most widely-known version of the tune from this time on. It would also be the song most associated with his musical career. The string intro was famously copied by the Eagles for their piano intro to &quot;Desperado&quot;.

In 1977, Robert Grossman, James Picker and Craig Whitaker created a clay animation short, &quot;Jimmy the C&quot;, in which U.S. President Jimmy Carter sings in Ray Charles&#x27; version of the song.

In 1979, the song was designated the State Song of Georgia, and Charles was invited to perform it at the state capitol.

The TV series &quot;Designing Women&quot; used an instrumental version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; as its opening theme. During the opening credits of the show&#x27;s sixth season in 1991, Charles performed his version of the song live on piano while the show&#x27;s cast watched him.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named the Ray Charles version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; the 44th greatest song of all time.

The original lyrics, including the commonly excised introductory verse, are in the Georgia Code under license.

== Ella Fitzgerald version ==
In 1962, famed jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald released a rendition of the song, produced by Norman Granz, on the album &quot;Ella Swings Gently with Nelson.&quot;

== The Hawks/The Band version ==
The song was a standard at performances by Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks, where it was sung by pianist Richard Manuel after 1964. When The Hawks broke up and formed The Band, they kept the song in their repertoire. They recorded a studio version of the song for Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential bid in 1976. It was released as a single that year as well as on their 1977 album &quot;Islands&quot;.

==Willie Nelson version==

Willie Nelson recorded the song on &quot;Stardust&quot;, his 1978 album of standards. It was released as single, peaked at No. 1 for a single week, and ranked for sixteen weeks on Billboard’s country charts. Nelson&#x27;s version won him a Grammy Award in 1979 at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.

<doc id="715418" wikidata="Q4819208" url="?curid=715418" title="Aubrey holes">
<text>The Aubrey holes are a ring of 56 chalk pits at Stonehenge, named after seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey. They date to the earliest phases of Stonehenge in the late fourth and early third millennium BC. Despite decades of argument and analysis, their purpose is still unknown, although an astronomical role has often been suggested.

Whilst visiting the monument in 1666, Aubrey noticed five circular cavities in the ground and noted them in his records. These features were ignored or not seen by the later antiquarians to investigate the site, and it was not until the 1920s during the work carried out by Colonel William Hawley that Hawley&#x27;s assistant Robert Newall identified a ring of pits he named in honour of Aubrey and his early survey.

The depressions seen by Aubrey himself are more likely to have been different features from those that now bear his name. Mike Pitts in a 1981 article in &quot;Nature&quot; pointed out that the holes had been backfilled thousands of years before Aubrey visited the site. The presence of later cremation burials and sarsen stone chips in the holes&#x27; upper fills supports this. That none of the other antiquarians who visited the site noticed any such holes implies that they were not permanent features either. Pitts argues that they were more likely to be the cavities left by features that had recently been removed. He has suggested that perhaps further megaliths stood at Stonehenge which occupied these other holes and are now lost.

==The holes==
25 of the holes were excavated by Hawley in 1920 and seven more in 1924. In 1950 Stuart Piggott and Richard Atkinson dug two more Aubrey Holes which brought the total excavated to 35, including one that Richard Colt Hoare may have encountered whilst digging beneath the fallen Slaughter Stone (so named from its reddish coloration) in the early nineteenth century. It was found that the pits were an average of 0.76m deep and 1.06m in diameter. 25 of the pits contained later cremation burials inserted into their upper fills along with long bone pins which may have secured leather or cloth bags used to hold the remains. Their presence makes Stonehenge Britain&#x27;s oldest cremation cemetery.
The pits appear to have been refilled with the freshly excavated chalk rubble soon after being dug as no weathering has been noted on the chalk sides of the pits. They may also have been dug out and refilled numerous times. The holes are in an accurate, 271.6m circumference circle, distributed around the edge of the area enclosed by Stonehenge&#x27;s earth bank, with a standard deviation in their positioning of 0.4m. The circle they describe is around 5m inside the monument&#x27;s bank. 21 of the holes remain unexcavated and no reliable dating material has been recovered from the other 35. The only available carbon date from the holes comes from charcoal in one of the later cremations. It gives the broad range of 2919–1519 BC. That sarsen stone chips have only been found in the upper fills of the excavated pits implies that the digging of the holes predates the megalithic phases of Stonehenge. From this stratigraphic evidence it is therefore likely that the holes were dug during the first phase of the monument, Stonehenge 1 (around 3100 BC) and were then reused for burials during Stonehenge 2 in successive centuries. By the time the standing stones of Stonehenge 3 were erected (around 2600 BC), the holes had fallen out of use.

The positions of the holes are marked at the Stonehenge site by white discs laid in the ground surface. Archaeologists number them 1 to 56 counting clockwise from the later Slaughter Stone at the eastern side of the north east entrance. Hawley reburied the human cremations he found, placing them in the backfilled hole number 7. These remains were re-excavated in August 2008 as part of the Stonehenge Riverside Project. A plaque dating from the 1935 reburial was uncovered at the site. The project was detailed in an episode of the PBS TV series &quot;Nova&quot; around the same time.

==Theories about the holes==
Many interpretations prefer an astronomical explanation for the purpose of the holes although this is by no means proved. It was formerly thought that when the Aubrey holes were first dug, the only standing feature at Stonehenge was the Heelstone, which marked the point of the midsummer sunrise, viewed from the centre of the henge. But the Heelstone is now attributed to Stonehenge 3 and was therefore not contemporary with the holes.

It has been suggested that the Aubrey holes were originally intended to be postholes containing timbers or stones but this is uncertain. Analogous timber circles at sites such as Woodhenge have influenced this interpretation; the positioning of the Aubrey Hole circle relative to the earth bank and ditch at Stonehenge is reproduced at similar sites with rings of timber postholes. That the holes appear to have been filled soon after excavation and then possibly redug does not exclude the possibility that they held timber posts which were replaced intermittently. No evidence of postpipes has been recovered with the holes although modern archaeological excavation techniques have not been applied to the pits. If the putative timbers were purposefully removed when they fell out of use, then even this evidence would be difficult to spot however. The lack of full documentation from the early Stonehenge digs in the twentieth century and the disturbance caused by the insertion of the later cremations during Stonehenge 2 have also added to the uncertainty over the function of the holes.

In a survey of twentieth-century excavations at Stonehenge, English Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Stonehenge in its landscape&quot;, archaeologist Karen Walker collated and studied the surviving records from all the earlier work on the holes and concluded that &quot;Although the evidence is inconclusive, and will no doubt be the subject of continued debate, the authors are inclined to support the view that the Aubrey Holes held posts, which were removed, rather than burnt in situ or left to decay.&quot;

In August 2008, further excavation of Aubrey Hole 7 by Mike Parker Pearson, Mike Pitts and Julian Richards led the archaeologists to suggest that the 56 holes had held Welsh bluestones, since they are too shallow to be postholes. In fact the holes are identical in width, depth, and shape to the bluestones located elsewhere in Stonehenge. They are confident that the Aubrey holes belong to Stonehenge&#x27;s initial phase of construction. Professor Parker Pearson said: &quot;It&#x27;s very exciting that we have evidence for stones right from its beginnings around 3000 BC. That&#x27;s almost 500 years earlier than anyone had thought.&quot;

==Archaeoastronomy and the Aubrey Holes==

The astronomical readings of the holes are largely a product of the interpretation of them as being simple pits without any structural features. This approach has required finding an explanation which tends towards the theory that the holes were repeatedly dug, filled and redug and excludes possibilities relating to any possible timber posts standing in them. The theory that they may have been used to hold temporary markers for use in astronomical observations gained credence in the 1960s.

An early attempt to analyse the positions of the Aubrey holes was undertaken by Gerald Hawkins, a professor of astronomy at Boston University in the 1960s, using an IBM 7090 computer. In his book &quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot;, Hawkins argued that the various features at the Stonehenge monument were arranged in such a way to predict a variety of astronomical events. He believed that the key to the holes&#x27; purpose was the lunar eclipse, which occurs on average about once a year on a 346.62 day cycle. Lunar eclipses are not always visible as the Moon may be below the horizon as it moves across the sky, but over 18 to 19 years (18.61 years to be precise) the date and position of a visible eclipse will return to its beginning point on the horizon again. As the motion of the Moon&#x27;s orbit also causes it to work its way across the sky on an 18.61 year cycle in what is known as the journey between major and minor standstill and back, the theory that this period was both measurable and useful to Neolithic peoples seemed attractive.

Lunar movements may have had calendrical significance to early peoples, especially farmers who would have benefited from the division of the year into periods which indicated the best times for planting. 18.61 is not a whole number and so it cannot be used to predict an eclipse without precision equipment, using only crude marker stones or timber posts in a circle instead. Hawkins&#x27; theory was that three 18.61 year cycles multiply out to 55.83, which is much closer to an integer and therefore easier to mark using 56 holes. Hawkins argued that the Aubrey Holes were used to keep track of this long time period and could accurately predict the recurrence of a lunar eclipse on the same azimuth, that which aligned with the Heel Stone, every 56 years. Going further, by placing marker stones at the ninth, eighteenth, twenty-eighth, thirty-seventh, forty-sixth and fifty sixth holes, Hawkins deduced that other intermediate lunar eclipses could also be predicted.

More recent examination, notably by Richard Atkinson, has proved Hawkins largely wrong, as it is now established that the different features at the monument that he tried to incorporate into many of his alignment theories were in use at different times and could not have worked alone, the lateness of the installation of the Heel Stone being the final nail in the coffin. Furthermore, the 56-year period is not in fact a reliable method of predicting eclipses and it is now accepted that they never repeat their date and position over three consecutive 18.61 year-long lunar cycles. Hawkins&#x27; theories also required strict observance of the phases of the moon which further complicated predictions using his model.

In 1966 Sir Fred Hoyle examined the arguments in favour of an astronomical purpose for the holes and concluded that the 28 day lunar cycle could still have been indicated by moving a marker stone representing the moon anticlockwise by two holes every day, ending up with 56 holes in total. By moving another marker anticlockwise two holes every 13 days, which represented the Sun, an annual journey around the circle could also be made. Two further marker stones would also have had to be moved round 3 holes per year to represent the points where the moon (or rather its marker) crossed the Sun marker&#x27;s path. Hoyle proved that this could have been used to produce a much more reliable method of predicting eclipses as whenever the moon and sun markers are directly opposite each other and the other two stones occupy those same opposing points, an eclipse can be guaranteed. This also has the additional benefit of not needing any standing stones to be present at the site.

On astronomical symbolism several analysts from Gerald Hawkins to Anthony Johnson have noted that Plutarch reported that Set in Egyptian myth or Typhon in Greek myth was identified as the shadow of the Earth which covers the Moon during lunar eclipses. Plutarch further records that the Pythagoreans symbolically associated Typhon with a polygon of 56 sides, hence the connection of 56 to lunar eclipses is explicit, at least for the Hellenistic era.
Although less complex and romantic than Hawkins&#x27; &#x27;Stone Age calculator&#x27; such a technique is certainly feasible if only in theory. Much more elaborate predictive practices have also been suggested for the holes although all these methods, including Hoyle&#x27;s, require a high level of astronomical awareness and a grasp of some very abstract concepts including knowing where and when to first position the stones around the circle. It has also been pointed out by R. Colton and R. L. Martin that simpler methods exist, based on observing the position of each moonrise, which would have worked just as well and which would not require moving numerous markers amongst 56 holes. This diminishes the astronomical significance of the number of the Aubrey Holes and their circular arrangement and tends to suggest that any astronomical purpose for the site may have been no more than symbolic.

According to the astrologers Bruno and Louise Huber the Aubrey holes were an astronomical abacus to mark the positions and calculate the movement of lunar nodes.

==Extra-astronomical interpretations==
Mike Pitts has asserted that the Aubrey Holes did in fact originally hold timbers and compares the site at this stage to Woodhenge, The Sanctuary near Avebury and other Neolithic timber circles. Such a view contradicts the archaeo-astronomical view of the holes as being a unique predictive device.

In fact, early Stonehenge may have been barely different from the other Neolithic timber circles of the British Isles, which had varying numbers of postholes and orientations and could therefore not have been used for in island-wide eclipse predicting. The interpretation of such timber circles is unclear, although parallels were drawn with Native American totem poles by Stuart Piggott in a 1946 BBC radio lecture. A 50 cm high carved wooden figure found in the Thames Marshes in 1912 and carbon dated to 2460–1980 BC has been used rather tenuously to support the theory of carved wooden posts serving a more terrestrial purpose.

Another possible explanation for the holes, suggested by Richard Atkinson, is that they were excavated in turn in some unknown ritual involving a procession around the inside of the monument. Others have pointed out the significance of the 28-day human menstrual cycle and argued that the holes may have been fertility indicators. Alexander Thom calculated that the circle of holes had been laid out in a circumference of 131 of his megalithic rods although this number has no known significance. A recent CAD study of the holes has shown that a 56-sided polygon can be generated by the simple use of square and circle geometry. Aubrey Burl also notes that the azimuth of the Heel Stone, beyond the Aubrey Circle, marks the midpoint in the swing of the Moon between major and minor standstill points, at 51.3 degrees.

The true purpose of the holes may never be known, although future excavation of the remaining twenty-four using modern archaeological techniques will certainly provide more information.

<text>Grant Show (born February 27, 1962) is an American actor. He is best known for his role on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; as Jake Hanson, which he played from 1992 to 1997. From 2017 to 2022, he portrayed Blake Carrington in the soap opera reboot &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Show is the son of Ed and Kathleen Show (née McMillion), and has a sister, Kelly, with whom he was raised in the Milpitas, California, area. He is a graduate of UCLA, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

==Career==
He broke into show business during college. His first major role was on the daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, in which he played Rick Hyde from 1984–1987. During his last year on the show, he received a Daytime Emmy nomination for &quot;Outstanding Young Actor in a Daytime Drama Series&quot;. Also during his time on the soap, Show dated fellow &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; actor Yasmine Bleeth. Hyped as the series&#x27; leading heart-throb, he even had a pin-up poster issued during the series&#x27; run but later became dissatisfied with acting in soaps and went to London in order to improve his craft. Returning to the US in the late 1980s, he landed occasional primetime television acting jobs.

He auditioned for (but did not receive) the part of J.D in the 1990 film Thelma and Louise, which was a break-out role for Brad Pitt. The other two actors who missed out after auditioning with Geena Davis were Mark Ruffalo and George Clooney, whom she did not recognise until he reminded her of his disappointment at missing out on the role several years later, a tale she recounted on the Graham Norton Show.

His appearances on television attracted the attention of producer Aaron Spelling, who felt he had star potential and decided to cast him as Jake Hanson on a few episodes of the popular series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; in order to spin off the character as the lead in his next series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Debuting with much fanfare (Show was on the covers of both &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;People&quot; immediately after the series&#x27; debut), the series&#x27; ratings in its first season were not up to expectations, and the show was revamped in the middle of the first season from an episodic strait-laced drama format to a melodramatic soap opera serial format in the tradition of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, one of Spelling&#x27;s earlier hits. The series made Show one of the most popular and best-known actors on American television during the 1990s. He also played Jake in a guest appearance in the pilot of the &quot;Melrose&quot; spin-off &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, making him the only actor to play the same character on the first three shows in the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; franchise.

During his time on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Show also appeared on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Laura Leighton. In 1997, Show, Laura Leighton (an off-screen girlfriend of Show&#x27;s for a period ), Doug Savant, Courtney Thorne-Smith and Marcia Cross left &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, which led the show into a major decline. It was cancelled two years later, though Show later regretted his decision to leave, despite his dislike of the scripts during his final season.

He has since starred in a number of television movies, including &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot; with Cicely Tyson, &quot;Between Love and Honor&quot; with Robert Loggia, and &quot;Homeland Security&quot; with Tom Skerritt and was one of the leads in the short-lived Fox Network supernatural drama &quot;Point Pleasant&quot; in 2005. He made a guest appearance for three episodes in HBO&#x27;s acclaimed series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; in 2002, and in 2006 he guest-starred on two episodes of the ABC Family show &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, alongside former &quot;Melrose Place&quot; co-star Daphne Zuniga.

In 2007, Show appeared in three episodes of the FX show &quot;Dirt&quot;, playing a closeted gay action movie hero, Jack Dawson. In 2008, Show starred in the short-lived CBS summer drama series &quot;Swingtown&quot; as an airline pilot, Tom Decker. Show was also featured in a recurring role in episodes of &quot;Private Practice&quot; in the 2008–2009 season. He starred opposite Jenna Elfman in the 2009 series &quot;Accidentally on Purpose&quot;, his first sitcom. In the 2010 and 2011 season, he appeared in the recurrent role of Michael Sainte, the Goji Guru, on the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot;. He has acted in a number of stage productions. In 1990, he played the lead in an adaptation of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and after his stint on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; he appeared in a production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. He was on Broadway in 1999 playing a doctor in Wit. In 2012, he appeared in the film &quot;The Possession&quot;, directed by Ole Bornedal, alongside Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick. In 2013, he began his role as Spence Westmore on &quot;Devious Maids&quot;. In March 2017, he was cast in The CW&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot; reboot as Blake Carrington.

==Personal life==
Grant Show married model and actress Pollyanna McIntosh in 2004. The couple met when they posed together for a Lane Bryant ad in 2003. They were divorced in 2011. In July 2012, Show became engaged to actress Katherine LaNasa. They married on August 18, 2012. They had a daughter, Eloise McCue Show, on March 25, 2014.

He is known for his leading role as Dr. Chris Turk in the ABC/NBC comedy-drama &quot;Scrubs&quot; (2001–2010), and a supporting role as Murray in both the film &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995) and the subsequent television series of the same name. He also starred as Phil Chase in the TV Land sitcom &quot;The Exes&quot; (2011–2015).

<doc id="715446" wikidata="Q147426" url="?curid=715446" title="Picea sitchensis">
<text>Picea sitchensis, the Sitka spruce, is a large, coniferous, evergreen tree growing to just over tall, with a trunk diameter at breast height that can exceed 5 m (16 ft). It is by far the largest species of spruce and the fifth-largest conifer in the world (behind giant sequoia, coast redwood, kauri, and western red cedar), and the third-tallest conifer species (after coast redwood and South Tibetan cypress). The Sitka spruce is one of only four species documented to exceed in height. Its name is derived from the community of Sitka in southeast Alaska, where it is prevalent. Its range hugs the western coast of Canada and the US and continues south into northern California.

==Description==
The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small, circular plates across. The inner bark is reddish-brown. The crown is broad conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may not have branches lower than . The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, and glabrous (hairless), but with prominent pulvini. The leaves are stiff, sharp, and needle-like, 15–25 millimeters long, flattened in cross-section, dark glaucous blue-green above with two or three thin lines of stomata, and blue-white below with two dense bands of stomata.
The cones are pendulous, slender cylindrical, long and broad when closed, opening to broad. They have thin, flexible scales long; the bracts just above the scales are the longest of any spruce, occasionally just exserted and visible on the closed cones. They are green or reddish, maturing pale brown 5–7 months after pollination. The seeds are black, long, with a slender, long pale brown wing.

===Size===
More than a century of logging has left only a remnant of the spruce forest. The largest trees were cut long before careful measurements could be made. Trees over tall may still be seen in Pacific Rim National Park and Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park on Vancouver Island, British Columbia (the Carmanah Giant, at tall, is the tallest tree in Canada), and in Olympic National Park, Washington and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California (United States), the latter of which houses the tallest individual measuring at 100.2 meters or 329 feet tall; two others at the last site are just over 96 m tall. The Queets Spruce is the largest in the world with a trunk volume of , a height of , and a dbh. It is located near the Queets River in Olympic National Park, about from the Pacific Ocean. Another specimen, from Klootchy Creek Park, Oregon, was previously recorded to be the largest with a circumference of and height of .

===Age===
Sitka spruce is a long-lived tree, with the oldest known individual just under 600 years old. Because it grows rapidly under favorable conditions, large size may not indicate exceptional age. The Queets Spruce has been estimated to be only 350 to 450 years old, but adds more than a cubic meter of wood each year.

===Root system===
Because it grows in extremely wet and poorly-drained soil, the Sitka spruce has a shallow root system with long lateral roots and few branchings. This also makes it susceptible to wind throw.

==Taxonomy==
DNA analysis has shown that only &quot;P. breweriana&quot; has a more basal position than Sitka spruce to the rest of the spruce. The other 33 species of spruce are more derived, which suggests that &quot;Picea&quot; originated in North America.

==Distribution and habitat==

Sitka spruce is native to the west coast of North America, with its northwestern limit on Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, and its southeastern limit near Fort Bragg in northern California. It is closely associated with the temperate rainforests and is found within a few kilometers of the coast in the southern portion of its range. North of Oregon, its range extends inland along river floodplains, but seldom does its range extend more than around from the Pacific Ocean and its inlets. It is situated at about above sea level in Alaska and generally below further south.

Forests with the species average between of rain annually. It is tolerant to salty spray common in coastal dune habitat, such as at Cape Disappointment State Park in Washington, and prefers soils high in magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus.

Sitka spruce has been introduced to Europe as a lumber tree, and was first planted there in the 19th century. Sitka spruce plantations have become a dominant forest type in Great Britain and Ireland, making up 25% of forest cover in the former and 52% in the latter. Sitka spruce woodland is also present in France and Denmark, and the plant was introduced to Iceland and Norway in the early 20th century. Observations of Sitka spruce along the Norwegian coast have shown the species to be growing 25–100% faster than the native Norway spruce there, even as far north as Vesterålen, and Sitka spruces planted along the southwest coast of Norway are growing fastest among the Sitka plantations in Europe.

A 9-metre-tall, 100-year-old Sitka spruce growing in the middle of the permanently uninhabited sub-antarctic Campbell Island has been recognised by the Guinness World Records as the &quot;most remote tree in the world&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Value to wildlife ===
Sitka spruce provides critical habitat for a large variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Its thick, sharp needles are poor browse for ungulates, and only the new spring growth is eaten. However, in Alaska and British Columbia the needles of &quot;Picea sitchensis&quot; comprise up to 90% of the winter diet of blue grouse.

Lichen-forming fungi &quot;Helocarpon lesdainii&quot; is found on &quot;Picea sitchensis&quot; trees in Harris Beach State Park, Oregon, USA.

It provides cover and hiding places for a large variety of mammals, and good nesting and roosting habitat for birds. Sitka deer require old-growth Sitka spruce forests for winter habitat, as the extensive foliage holds a significant percentage of fallen snow in a given area, thus allowing for better understory browsing and easier migration for terrestrial animals. Cavity nesting birds favor Sitka spruce snags, and the tree is used by bald eagles, and peregrine falcons as nesting habitat.

=== Successional status ===
Sitka spruce is shade tolerant but not as much as its competitors, preferring full sun if possible. It is a pioneer on landslides, sand dunes, uplifted beaches, and deglaciated terrain. However, it is a climax species in coastal forests, where it can become dominant.

===Fire ecology===
Due to the prevalence of Sitka spruce in cool, wet climates, its thin bark and shallow root system are not adapted to resist fire damage and it is thus very susceptible. Sitka spruce forests have a fire regime of severe crown or surface fires on long intervals, (150 to 350+ years) which results in total stand replacement. Sitka spruce recolonizes burned sites via wind-dispersed seed from adjacent unburned forests.

==Uses==
The root bark of Sitka spruce trees is used in Native Alaskan basket-weaving designs and for rain hats. The pitch was used for caulking, chewing, and its medicinal properties. Native Americans heated and plied the roots to make cord. The resin was used as glue and for waterproofing. Natives and pioneers split off shakes for construction use. The wood is light and relatively strong.

Sitka spruce is of major importance in forestry for timber and paper production. Outside its native range, it is particularly valued for its fast growth on poor soils and exposed sites where few other trees can prosper; in ideal conditions, young trees may grow per year. It is naturalized in some parts of Ireland and Great Britain, where it was introduced in 1831 by David Douglas, and New Zealand, though not so extensively as to be considered invasive. Sitka spruce is also planted extensively in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. In Norway, Sitka spruce was introduced in the early 1900s. An estimated have been planted in Norway, mainly along the coast from Vest-Agder in the south to Troms in the north. It is more tolerant to wind and saline ocean air, and grows faster than the native Norway spruce. But in Norway, the Sitka spruce is now considered an invasive species, and effort to eliminate it is being made.

The resonant wood is used widely in piano, harp, violin, and guitar manufacture, as its high strength-to-weight ratio and regular, knot-free rings make it an excellent conductor of sound. For these reasons, the wood is also an important material for sailboat spars, and aircraft wing spars (including flying models). The Wright brothers&#x27; Flyer was built using Sitka spruce, as were many aircraft before World War II; during that war, aircraft such as the British Mosquito used it as a substitute for strategically important aluminium.

Newly grown tips of Sitka spruce branches are used to flavor spruce beer and are boiled to make syrup.

== Indigenous culture ==

A unique specimen with golden foliage that used to grow on Haida Gwaii, known as Kiidk&#x27;yaas or &quot;The Golden Spruce&quot;, is sacred to the Haida First Nations people. It was illegally felled in 1997 by Grant Hadwin, although saplings grown from cuttings can now be found near its original site.

In the Lushootseed language, spoken in what is now Washington state, it is known as c̓əlaqayac.

== Chemistry ==
The stilbene glucosides astringin, isorhapontin, and piceid can be found in the bark of the Sitka spruce.

==Burls==
In the Olympic National Forest in Washington, Sitka spruce trees near the ocean sometimes develop burls.

According to a guidebook entitled &quot;Olympic Peninsula&quot;, &quot;Damage to the tip or the bud of a Sitka spruce causes the growth cells to divide more rapidly than normal to form this swelling or burl. Even though the burls may look menacing, they do not affect the overall tree growth.&quot;

<doc id="715453" wikidata="Q2308547" url="?curid=715453" title="Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport">
<text>Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport , formerly known as Palmaseca International Airport, is an international airport located between Palmira and Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca Department, Colombia. It is Colombia&#x27;s fourth-busiest airport in passenger volume, with 5,600,000 people using the airport in 2016, and the third largest in area and construction. The airport often serves as the alternate airport for Bogotá - El Dorado Int&#x27;l Airport and other Colombian airports.

The airport lies in the center of the wide and fertile Cauca River valley, which runs north–south between the Western and Central Colombian Andes ranges. It is approximately a five-hour flight from Santiago de Chile, 50 minutes from Quito, Ecuador, and about three hours, 18 minutes from Miami.

The airport is one of the very few secondary airports in Latin America that operates 24 hours a day. This is made possible by the year-round stable meteorological conditions, and its distance from both Cali and Palmira, which means it is not subject to any noise restrictions, allowing aircraft to take off and land at any time of day. The airport has non-stop flights to the United States, Spain, Panama, Dutch Antilles, Mexico and Chile.

==History==
On April 21, 1921, Ferruccio Guicciardi flew his Italian-made Macchi-Hanriot HD-1, (named &quot;Telegraph I&quot;) from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to Cali, with stops in Quito and Pasto, Colombia. This was the first aircraft ever to land in Cali. He claimed the $9,500 peso prize offered by the Department of Valle and the Cali City Council to the first pilot who landed in the city. This event marked the birth of aviation activity in the capital of Valle del Cauca.

===SCADTA===
Following the war with Peru in 1932, President Enrique Olaya Herrera sought the help of SCADTA engineers and pilots to find a suitable site for an airport capable of providing air support to military operations. After evaluating several alternatives, the German pilot Herbert Boy chose an area called &quot;El Guabito&quot; because of its location, proximity to the city and an extension of Juanchito Antioquia Avenue. After levelling the land with bulldozers a fledgling Air Force Base and Air National Guard station were built and operations began on September 21, 1933. Eventually, the number of airlines operating from the airport grew to include &quot;TACA de Colombia&quot; and VIARCO SAETA along with the already established SCADTA Panagra.

However, Panagra began looking for a suitable place for an airport in order to link South America with Panama through Cali, as well as its domestic flights operated by Avianca. To this end, they acquired land in the municipality of Candelaria, 18 miles from the center of Cali. On April 17, 1947, the modern facilities at &quot;Calipuerto&quot; were inaugurated. The airport passed to the Colombian state in the 1950s and was subsequently taken over by the Civil Aeronautics Department in 1968.

In 1946, the company VIARCO Valle, under the management of Ricardo A. Deeb, implemented an expansion policy including the construction of its own airport in Cali. The airport would be open to all airlines in the country except Avianca. In November 1946, the Aviation Authority requested an inspection of the new &quot;El Limonnar&quot; airport, located in the Pasoancho area of the city. In early 1947, the works were completed at the airport, which was put in service and equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment at that time. &quot;LANSA&quot; and other smaller companies also moved operations to this airport from the military airport at El Guabito, later renamed the Marco Fidel Suarez AFB. El Limonar was closed in 1954 following a merger between &quot;LANSA&quot; and Avianca and the subsequent transfer of operations to Calipuerto. The city of Cali, like Bogota, at that time had three active airports in operation. When the new Palmaseca Airport opened the old Calipuerto buildings and runways were adapted and expanded to house Cavasa, an agricultural and food products distribution centre.

===Palmaseca International Airport===
The history of the new airport is directly linked to the 1971 Pan American Games, which were held in Cali. The infrastructure required to host an event of this magnitude made both the local and national government agencies broaden their horizons and commit to building the long-awaited and much-needed facility. The Civil Aeronautics Agency had already purchased a large plot of land from Hacienda Palmaseca in the neighbouring town of Palmira. The project was beset by operational and financial difficulties, and the central government had to inject a further US$35 million in order to complete the physical construction and meet international aviation safety standards. Furthermore, new roads linking the airport to the industrial city of Yumbo and the main Cali - Palmira highway were also built as part of the project.

Palmaseca International Airport was inaugurated on July 24, 1971, during the government of President Misael Pastrana Borrero. It had a 3000m long runway, taxiways, a parking apron, and a main terminal building for domestic and international flights. The terminal was equipped with airline service counters, restaurants, shops, a small hotel and even a nondenominational prayer chapel for nervous passengers. Although some critics initially claimed it was unnecessarily large and expensive for the city&#x27;s needs at the time, air operations and passenger numbers quickly grew, justifying the size and cost of the project. The electronic, communications and safety equipment at the airport was recognized when it was designated as the alternate for Bogotá&#x27;s El Dorado Int&#x27;l. Airport.

In June 1989 local authorities renamed the airport after Alfonso Bonilla Aragón, a local civic leader and journalist who played a prominent role in the approval and construction of the airport. This decision proved highly unpopular with the people of Cali, and there were serious efforts made to reverse the decision. Even the Business Guilds and the Cali Chamber of Commerce formally requested that the government intercede and force the Civil Aeronautics Agency to change the name back to &quot;Palmaseca&quot;.

==Reform and Privatisation==
At the beginning of 1982, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, Director of Civil Aeronautics (then President of Colombia), made the decision to decentralize the management of two important international airports: Palmaseca in Cali and Olaya Herrera in Medellín. Palmaseca would be administered by a mixed economy company, proposed by the Permanent Business Committee of Valle del Cauca and the Cali Chamber of Commerce. The entity that would have to abide by the rules of public establishments would be 90% economically backed by state capital and 10% by private capital. The shareholders included Empresas Públicas de Cali, Palmira, Cortuvalle, C.V.C and Corporación Financiera del Transporte. This decentralization was never carried out and only years later the privatization process began

In the mid-1980s, part of the international terminal satellite collapsed, causing many criticisms of the design and construction firms of the building. In 1986 Civil Aeronautics had to assume the reconstruction of the international terminal satellite, together with the reinforcement of the rest of the structure.

The mid-1980s saw the construction of the cargo terminal, the general aviation area and a new airport fire station. In mid-1989 the main runway was repaved, which had deteriorated along 700 meters of the 3000 total meters in length. The general aviation area was also built, which unfortunately soon became a clandestine center for drug trafficking operations.

For this reason, the Aeroclub del Pacifico decided to acquire a large plot of land near the Free Trade Zone, adjacent to header 1–9 to build its new facilities with direct access to the taxiway.

Years later the National Museum of Transport was built in that area.

==Structure and capacity==
*Loading facilities feature a 747 freighter dock, bonded warehouse, in-transit area, free trade zone, cargo loading and unloading vehicles and equipment, public health officials, secure storage for valuables, and express and messenger center.
*Avianca has an Executive Lounge on the top floor of the Domestic Satellite Terminal, offering free Wi-Fi, cable TV, a wet bar and snacks counter, free newspapers and charging ports for mobile devices.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport.
===Cargo===
==Accidents and incidents ==
*On 21 January 1974, a Vickers Viscount of Aeropesca Colombia was hijacked and diverted to Cali.
*On 6 June 1992, Copa Airlines Flight 201 from Panama City to Bonilla Aragón Airport crashed in the Darién Gap due to spatial disorientation caused by instrument malfunction.
*On 20 December 1995, American Airlines Flight 965 from Miami to Bonilla Aragón Airport crashed into a mountain near Cali due to pilot error resulting from misinterpretation of waypoints meant to guide the plane into Bonilla. It remains the deadliest air disaster in Colombia.

<text>Pacific Union College (PUC) is a private Seventh-day Adventist liberal arts college in Angwin, California. It is the only four-year college in Napa County, and the twelfth oldest institution of higher education in California. As a coeducational residential college with an almost exclusively undergraduate student body, most of those who attend the college are four-year students living on campus.

PUC is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission and maintains various programmatic accreditation for specific programs. Enrollment at Pacific Union College is roughly 825. The college offers about 60 undergraduate majors and three master&#x27;s programs organized in 25 academic departments, with its health science degrees the largest number of those sought out by students. The campus occupies of the college&#x27;s in property.

== History ==
=== Early years (1882–1908) ===
Pacific Union College was founded as Healdsburg Academy in Healdsburg, California, in northern Sonoma County, in 1882. The creation of schools in the state was urged by Ellen G. White and other church leaders in an effort to accommodate the Adventist Church&#x27;s growing membership on the West Coast and to train young Adventists for its work. The academy officially opened on April 11 of that year. It was the twelfth institution of higher education founded in California, and is the second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the Mississippi River.

Sidney Brownsberger served as its first President. Under his term, the academy focused on both conventional study of standard subjects as well as practical skills, such as dressmaking, blacksmithing, carpentry, and cooking, in line with White&#x27;s desire for the college. The lengthy tenure of William C. Grainger saw the heyday of the Academy&#x27;s early years, but with the turn of the century, poor financial management led to increasing debt that eventually forced the academy to close in July 1908.

=== Move to Angwin (1909–1921) ===

Despite this failure, many church leaders – including White herself – continued to push for expanded Adventist schooling, and efforts were begun in the 1900s to find a new location to rebuild the college. Many sites were scouted out in the Central Valley and elsewhere within the state, but none came to the satisfaction of the searchers.

Eventually, in 1909, the Pacific Union Conference announced that it had found an opening to purchase the 1,636 acres of the Angwin Resort on Howell Mountain in neighboring Napa County. The property had been found through the church&#x27;s St. Helena Sanitarium, and White visited the site in September in 1909. Satisfied with the condition of its facilities and living quarters and the ease with which they could be adapted for teaching purposes, its abundant resources in springs and lumber, and the healthful living its geography would provide, White approved the location. The property was bought in the same month for $60,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2022), and opened its doors September 29. The name of the college was finalized as Pacific Union College in 1910 to reflect change in location, even as it had changed names a few times before.

PUC&#x27;s first president at Angwin was Charles W. Irwin, who served from the opening of the new location until 1921. Irwin&#x27;s term was marked by self-sufficiency as the college adapted to its new location, with both the faculty and student body working to expand the campus through the area&#x27;s available natural resources.

=== Early 20th century (1922–1943) ===
In the 1920s and 1930s, PUC expanded its educational programs with the goal of receiving educational accreditation. Driven by suggestions from the college&#x27;s board, PUC required that professors have postgraduate degrees to teach, created lower and upper divisions, introduced major and minor degrees, and necessitated the completion of senior theses for graduation. The college also extended funds to pay for faculty members&#x27; graduate studies. With these changes, PUC became the first Adventist college to become accredited when it was awarded accreditation by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools in 1933.

This era also saw further expansion of the campus community through the construction of more facilities – including new men&#x27;s dormitories and its current gymnasium – as well as through the creation of the college&#x27;s first student association, the Associated Students of Pacific Union College (ASPUC), in January 1935. The college&#x27;s student newspaper, the &quot;Campus Chronicle&quot;, published its first issue in 1925 after being adapted from the previous &quot;Mountain Echo&quot;, while the &quot;Diogenes Lantern&quot;, PUC&#x27;s current yearbook, was first published in 1938.

With the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, over 400 male students and alumni were eventually drafted into military service.

=== Other history (1943–2023) ===
In 2006 the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees underscored PUC&#x27;s commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done.

In 2006, PUC&#x27;s Board of Trustees made plans to transform the area into an ecovillage of several hundred settlements, in partnership with Triad Development, a Seattle-based construction firm. Although the college downscaled its original plans due to community opposition – primarily by Save Rural Angwin, a local NIMBY group – the board voted in October 2010 to sever its contract with Triad and cancel the project.

Pacific Union College has had a total of twenty-four presidents. The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. Ralph Trecartin, the current president, took office in July 2021 after serving as the associate provost and dean of the College of Professionals for Andrews University.

== Academics ==
Pacific Union College is the only four-year college located in Napa County, California. It offers around 60 undergraduate majors in various fields, along with other types of programs. Health science, business, and education are the leading fields in which students seek out degrees, and their degree programs are accredited by their respective accreditation bodies.

=== Curriculum ===
Pacific Union College offers 44 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 10 associate degree programs, and three master&#x27;s degree programs, in addition to minors, credential programs, pre-professional tracks, and an honors program. These are all organized throughout 25 academic departments. The school operates on a quarter-based academic calendar.

Though the range of its offerings is quite broad, PUC&#x27;s most prominent programs are those in the health sciences, which are sought out by a considerable number of those who attend. In the 2020–2021 school year, two-thirds of all undergraduate degrees awarded were in the medical field, and 96% of the associate&#x27;s degrees awarded were for nursing.

PUC maintains an especially close connection to Loma Linda University School of Medicine, another Adventist institution, and most of the college&#x27;s pre-professional programs are meant specifically for admission into Loma Linda. The college has sent a steady stream of students to the university for several decades; visiting from Loma Linda in 1925, John H. Kellogg noted that PUC was &quot;the college that sends the largest number of medical students from any one place.&quot; Degrees in business and education follow behind as the second two most sought-after.

Similar to its emphasis on manual labor and physical health in its Healdsburg days, PUC necessitates that students takes fitness classes as part of its general education requirements. Offerings in the past have included fencing, trikke, pickleball, swimming, water aerobics, polo, canoeing, skiing, snowboarding, soccer, dance, and yoga, though some of these have since been discontinued.

Similar to other Adventist schools, PUC offers study-abroad programs through Adventist Colleges Abroad (ACA), primarily in Europe and Latin America. Most of these programs were designed for those seeking degrees from the college&#x27;s World Languages Department, though non-language majors often study abroad through the ACA as well. PUC also organizes mission trips independently of ACA.

=== Rankings ===
At the start of the 2023–2024, the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Pacific Union College the 13th best regional college in the Western United States, the 12th top performer in social mobility (a position in shares with the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising), and the second Best Value School. In the same year, the &quot;New York Times&quot; ranked PUC the 8th most economically diverse college in the U.S. Niche gives the college an overall B− score, and ranks it the 24th most diverse college in California, with its diversity graded A+. It also ranks PUC as the 14th best nursing college in California.

=== Accreditation ===
Pacific Union College has been accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission or its predecessor since 1951. In February 2020, however, the commission issued a formal Notice of Concern regarding the college&#x27;s accreditation, citing PUC&#x27;s dwindling financial resources and dramatic drops in enrollment as areas that needed improvement. Though in the years following PUC noted moderate increases in enrollment and dismissed a number of its employees in response to WSCUC&#x27;s recommendations, the commission has not withdrawn its Notice of Concern. PUC is also accredited by the Adventist Church&#x27;s own Adventist Accrediting Association.

In addition to these two institution-wide accreditations, many of PUC&#x27;s programs and departments are accredited or approved by their respective programmatic accreditation bodies, including:

* National Association of Schools of Art and Design
* National Association of Schools of Music
* California Commission on Teacher Credentialing
* International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education
* Council on Social Work Education
* Accrediting Commission for Education in Nursing

== Campus and facilities ==
The college is located in Angwin, on Howell Mountain overlooking the Napa Valley, 70 miles (110 km) north of San Francisco and 60 miles (85 km) from the Pacific Ocean. The main campus comprises about only of the college&#x27;s in property. The remaining is managed as a conservation easement.

Since 2007, Bon Appétite has catered the PUC Dining Commons. It serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan menu items sourced from local producers, in accordance with Adventist health beliefs and the company&#x27;s own catering methods. During winter 2011, the Commons saw heavy renovations which redesigned the cafeteria&#x27;s architectural style and expanded its space. In 2021, supply chain shortages caused by COVID-19 disrupted the kitchen&#x27;s ability to source local ingredients.

The college&#x27;s main library is the Nelson Memorial Library, with holdings of around 150,000 books. It also houses the Pitcairn Islands Study Center, with a collection of materials about the Pitcairn Islands, as well as literary collections for various figures in Adventist history. In 2011, the library was renovated at a cost of over a million dollars.

=== Albion Field Station ===
The college owns as operates the Albion Field Station, in Mendocino County, on the Albion River by the Pacific coast. Though the station was designed for educational purposes, and PUC&#x27;s biology department makes use of the river&#x27;s tide pools and estuaries for course learning, its cabins and other facilities have made it a center of broader student life, and sees visits from other departments.
=== Angwin–Parrett Field ===
Pacific Union College owns and operates Angwin–Parrett Field, a public use airport located on its campus. The airport was the landing spot during George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential visit to the Napa Valley in 2006. The airport also supports PUC&#x27;s Bachelor of Science degree in aviation and offers ground schools and flight instruction to the community.

=== PUC Forest ===
Much of the school&#x27;s undeveloped acreage is managed as the PUC Demonstration &amp; Experimental Forest, though on campus it has sometimes been called the Back 40. The forest was part of the Angwin property and a site of lumber before it was bought by the college. It spans roughly . In addition to providing the resources necessary for the expansion of the campus in its early years, the forest has also served as a site for biological research and preservation, enclosing as it does unique species and biodiversity.

In 2018, PUC partnered with the Napa County Land Trust to preserve the forest as a conservation easement; the easement is currently held by CalFire. Covering , the easement protects about half of college&#x27;s total property. It was valued at $7.1 million, much of it due to vineyard potential. Attempts in the past have been made to develop or sell the land, however; most notably, the college made plans to transform the area into an ecovillage in 2006, but it ultimately chose to cancel the project.

Still, with a network of hiking trails spanning 35 miles, the forest sees regular use. In 2019, the college partnered with Napa County&#x27;s Open Space District to open its trail network to the public. The forest is also a section along the Bay Area Ridge Trail, and was linked in the same year. The 2009 Tour of California, an cycling race held within the state, raced through PUC.

=== Pacific Union College Church ===
Pacific Union College Church is the campus church, built in 1968. It has around 1,600 members. The church&#x27;s large pipe organ was built by Austrian organ-maker Rieger Orgelbau and installed in 1981. The church complex also has classrooms for theology classes and houses PUC&#x27;s Office of Service, Justice, and Missions.

==Student life==
Pacific Union College&#x27;s stated focus is on undergraduate education. In the fall of 2021, 829 students were enrolled at PUC, 825 of whom were undergraduate students. The school maintains a student/teacher ratio of roughly 12:1. As a residential college, the vast majority of these students live in one of seven on-campus residence halls.

=== Demographics ===
Within PUC&#x27;s student body, the three largest ethnic demographics are Hispanic (31% in fall 2021), Asian (23%), and White (21%), while the remaining quarter includes Black students and others. Female students make up a majority of those on campus (63%), while male students comprise about a third (37%). A large majority of students are from California (78%), with only a fraction enrolling from out of state. PUC was ranked as the most diverse liberal arts college in the Western United States by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for the 2022–2023 school year.

PUC also maintains a DEI Council as well as a Title IX Office. It accepts the WSCUC criteria for diversity: race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender, age, religious belief, sexual orientation and disability.

=== Student association ===
The Pacific Union College Student Association (PUCSA) was started in 1887, just five years after the college was founded. It consists of an executive branch and a Student Senate. PUCSA funds publication of the school&#x27;s student-run newspaper, the &quot;Campus Chronicle,&quot; and the college yearbook, the &quot;Diogenes Lantern&quot;.

=== Student organizations ===
There are more than 50 clubs, Honor&#x27;s Associations and Student Ministries active on campus at Pacific Union College. These include the Secular Student Alliance, Biology Club, Asian Student Association, Pre-Med Club, Korean Adventist Student Association, Dramatic Arts Society, Musical Arts Symposium, Homeless Ministry, Psi Chi, College Democrats and others. In addition to the &quot;Campus Chronicle&quot;, there are several other student-run publications including a literary periodical, &quot;Quicksilver&quot;.
==== Gay and Straight People ====
A gay-straight alliance, Gay and Straight People (GASP), has operated on campus since October 2008. It was first organized by a pre-med student named Jonathan Heldt, who established the alliance when he was a senior in the hopes of creating a support group for LGBTQ students and their allies. Originally intending to form an official club, Heldt&#x27;s proposal was rejected by PUC&#x27;s Advisory Council.

Students and faculty continue to meet regularly to discuss LGBTQ issues. Though the club remains formally unrecognized by the college, the group contributed to the expansion of all-gender bathrooms on campus, and has had presence at the college&#x27;s student orientation and club fairs. In December 2022, the Student Senate passed a bill calling for GASP&#x27;s recognition as an official club, though it has yet to be addressed by administration.

== Athletics ==
The Pacific Union athletic teams are called the Pioneers. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (CalPac) since the 1996–97 academic year.

Pacific Union competes in eight intercollegiate sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and volleyball.

=== Accomplishments ===
PUC has been awarded the &quot;California Pacific Conference Team Sportsmanship Award&quot; five times since 2003, most recently for the 2010–2011 school year. In fall 2011, the coaches for varsity women&#x27;s volleyball and men&#x27;s soccer described it as &quot;rebuilding&quot; time. This award signifies the school that displays outstanding sportsmanship and exemplifies the true spirit of the &quot;Champions of Character&quot; program set forth by the NAIA.

=== Intramurals ===
PUC maintains an active intramural athletic program under the name RecRadio.org. The intramural athletic program is the top intramural athletics program in the country according to College Prowler&#x27;s &quot;Best Intramural Sports&quot; ranking.

== Alumni ==
Pacific Union College has been described as a &quot;training ground for an inordinately large number of outstanding physicians, dentists, nurses, teachers and theologians&quot; who make up its 50,000 alumni. A large majority of students who graduate from the college do so with degrees in the health sciences. Most of PUC&#x27;s notable alumni include individuals in academic administration or political offices, though some have been recognized in other fields.

<text>The Caribbean hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita clypeatus&quot;), also known as the soldier crab, West Atlantic crab, tree crab, or purple pincher (due to the distinctive purple claw), is a species of land hermit crab native to the west Atlantic, Belize, southern Florida, Venezuela, and the West Indies.

==Description==
Adults burrow and hide under the roots of large trees, and can be found a considerable distance inland. As with other terrestrial decapods, they use modified gills to breathe air. Their shells help maintain the humidity necessary for gas exchange to function. Typically, the Caribbean hermit crab&#x27;s left claw is larger in size than its right claw and is purple in color. Female land hermit crabs release fertilized eggs into the ocean. The spawning (called &quot;washing&quot; in the English-speaking Caribbean) occurs on certain nights, usually around August.

==Ecology==
Caribbean hermit crabs are both herbivorous and scavengers. In the wild, &quot;C. clypeatus&quot; feeds on animal and plant remains, overripe fruit, and faeces of other animals, including the Mona ground iguana (&quot;Cyclura stejnegeri&quot;). The West Indian top snail (&quot;Cittarium pica&quot;) shell is often used for its home, and the hermit crab can use its larger claw to cover the aperture of the shell for protection against predators. As with other species of hermit crabs, &quot;C. clypeatus&quot; may engage in &quot;shell fights&quot; and can emit a chirping noise when stressed.

==Pet Trade==
This species is one of the two land hermit crabs commonly sold in the United States as pets, the other being the Ecuadorian hermit crab. &quot;C. clypeatus&quot; has been confirmed to live as long as 12 years, and some crab owners have claimed to have crabs live up to 40 years.

<doc id="715472" wikidata="Q166977" url="?curid=715472" title="Chiayi County">
<text>Chiayi County is a county in Taiwan. Located in southwestern Taiwan surrounding but not including Chiayi City, it is the sixth largest county in the island of Taiwan. Its major tourist destination is Alishan National Scenic Area.

==Name==
The former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (), a representation of the original Formosan-language name &quot;Tirosen&quot;. A shortened version, Tsulo, was then used to name Tsulo County, which originally covered the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of the island. In 1704, the county seat was moved to Tsulosan, the site of modern-day Chiayi City. Following the 1723 Zhu Yigui rebellion, the county was reduced in size. In 1787, the county and city were renamed &quot;Chiayi&quot; (; ) by the Qianlong Emperor to acknowledge the citizens&#x27; loyalty during the Lin Shuangwen rebellion.

==History==
===Qing dynasty===
Chiayi County was originally part of Zhuluo County during the Qing dynasty. It was given its modern name by the Qianlong Emperor after the Lin Shuangwen rebellion  in 1788 for its role in resisting the rebels.

===Empire of Japan===
From 1920, during the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the area of Tainan Prefecture covered modern-day Chiayi County, Chiayi City, Tainan and Yunlin County.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945, the area of present-day Chiayi County was administered under Tainan County. In October 1950, Chiayi County was established as a county of Taiwan Province. Chiayi City was designated as the county seat.

In July 1982, Chiayi City was upgraded to a provincial city, thus in December 1981, Chiayi County government relocated the county seat to Dongshiliao Farm in Taibao Township.

In March 1989, Wufong Township was renamed Alishan Township. In July 1991, Taibao Township was reorganized as Taibao City. In November 1991, Chiayi County government relocated the county seat from Dongshiliao Farm to Hsiangho New Village in Taibao City. Puzi Township was reorganized as a county-administered city in September 1992.

==Geography==
Chiayi County borders Mount Yu to the east, Taiwan Strait to the west, Tainan City to the south and Yunlin County to the north. It spans over , about 5.35% of the area of Taiwan. Chiayi County is located along the Tropic of Cancer.

==Administration==

==Demographics==

The current population of Chiayi County as of May 2022 is 490,423 people. The county has been experiencing a population decline since 2009 due to higher migration out of the county and a higher death rate than birth rate.

All of the existing industrial parks in the county were built before 1981. Class 2 and class 3 industries have been developing slowly throughout Chiayi, thus the economic development is sluggish as well, resulting in slow urban development.

Three industrial parks named the Dapumei Industrial Park (), Ma Chou Hou Industrial Park () and Budai Intelligent Industrial Park are currently under planning in the county. Industrial parks in the neighboring counties and cities also contributed to the difficulty of industrial developments in Chiayi County.

<text>The Golden Rose (, ) is a gold ornament, which popes of the Catholic Church have traditionally blessed annually. It is occasionally conferred as a token of reverence or affection. Recipients have included churches and sanctuaries, royalty, military figures, and governments.

== Significance and symbolism ==
The rose is blessed on the fourth Sunday of Lent, Lætare Sunday (also known as &quot;Rose Sunday&quot;), when rose-coloured vestments and draperies substitute for the penitential purple, symbolizing hope and joy in the midst of Lenten solemnity. Throughout most of Lent, Catholics pray, fast, perform penance, and meditate upon the malice of sin and its negative effects; but Rose Sunday is an opportunity to look beyond Christ&#x27;s death at Calvary and forward to His joyous Resurrection. The beautiful Golden Rose symbolizes the Risen Christ of glorious majesty. (The Messiah is hailed &quot;the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys&quot; in the Bible.) The rose&#x27;s fragrance, according to Pope Leo XIII, &quot;shows the sweet odor of Christ which should be widely diffused by His faithful followers&quot; (Acta, vol. VI, 104), and the thorns and red tint of the petals refer to His bloody Passion.

Many popes, on the occasion of conferring the Rose, have in sermons and letters explained its mystical significance. Innocent III said: &quot;As Lætare Sunday, the day set apart for the function, represents love after hate, joy after sorrow, and fullness after hunger, so does the rose designate by its colour, odour and taste, love, joy and satiety respectively,&quot; also comparing the rose to the flower referred to in Isaiah 11:1: &quot;There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of his root.&quot;

== History and development of the modern Rose ==

=== Workmanship ===
The blossom

Before the pontificate of Sixtus IV (1471–84) the Golden Rose consisted of a simple and single blossom made of pure gold and slightly tinted with red. Later, to embellish the ornament while still retaining the mystical symbolism, the gold was left untinted but rubies and afterwards many precious gems were placed in the heart of the rose or on its petals.

Pope Sixtus IV substituted in place of the single rose a thorny branch with leaves and many (ten or more) roses, the largest of which sprang from the top of the branch with smaller roses clustering around it. In the center of the principal rose was a tiny cup with a perforated cover, into which the pope poured musk and balsam to bless the rose. The whole ornament was of pure gold. This &#x27;Sistine&#x27; design was maintained but varied as to decoration, size, weight and value. Originally it was little over three inches in height, and was easily carried in the Pope&#x27;s left hand as he blessed the multitude with his right hand, when passing in procession from the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (in Rome) to the Lateran Palace. Afterwards, especially when a vase and large pedestal became part of the ornament, a robust cleric was required to carry it, preceding the papal cross in the procession. The rose sent to Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick, wife of Joseph I, afterwards emperor, by Innocent XI, weighed twenty pounds and was almost eighteen inches high. It was in bouquet form, with three twisting branches that came together after many windings at the top of the stem, supporting a large rose and cluster of leaves.

Vase and pedestal

The vase and the pedestal supporting it have varied as to material, weight, and form. In the beginning they were made of gold; but afterward of silver heavily gilt with gold. The pedestal can be either triangular, quadrangular, or octangular, and is richly ornamented with various decorations and bas-reliefs. In addition to the customary inscription, the coat of arms of the pope who had the ornament made, and that of he who blessed and conferred it, are engraved on the pedestal.

=== Value of the ornament ===

The value of the rose varies according to the munificence of the pontiffs or the economic circumstances of the times.
Baldassari (1709) says that the rose conferred about the year 1650 cost about 500 &quot;scudi d&#x27;oro&quot; (equivalent of about 1.7 kg of gold).
The two roses sent by Pope Alexander VII were valued at about 800 and 1200 scudi respectively. Pope Clement IX sent the Queen of France one costing about 1600 scudi, made of eight pounds of gold. 
The workmanship on this rose was exceedingly fine, for which the artificer received the equivalent of 300 scudi. Innocent XI caused seven and one-half pounds of gold to be formed into a rose, which was further embellished with many sapphires, costing in all 1450 scudi.
Rock (1909) adds that in the 19th century not a few of the roses cost 2000 scudi and more.

=== Origin ===
The custom of giving the rose supplanted the ancient practice of sending Catholic rulers the Golden Keys from St. Peter&#x27;s Confessional, a custom introduced either by Pope Gregory II (716) or Pope Gregory III (740). A certain analogy exists between the rose and the keys: both are of pure gold blessed and bestowed by the pope upon illustrious Catholics, and also, both are somewhat reminiscent of a reliquary—the rose contains musk and balsam, the keys are filings from the Chair of St. Peter.

The exact date of the institution of the rose is unknown. According to some it is anterior to Charlemagne (742–814), according to others it had its origin at the end of the 12th century, but it certainly antedates the year 1050, since Pope Leo IX (1051) speaks of the rose as of an ancient institution at his time.

The custom, started when the popes moved to Avignon, of conferring the rose upon the most deserving prince at the papal court, continued after the papacy moved back to Rome. The prince would receive the rose from the pope in a solemn ceremony and be accompanied by the College of Cardinals from the papal palace to his residence. From the beginning of the seventeenth century, the rose was sent only to queens, princesses and eminent noblemen. Emperors, kings and princes were given a blessed sword and hat as a more suitable gift. However, if a deserving Catholic emperor, king or other great prince was present in Rome on Lætare Sunday, he would be presented with the rose.

The office of carrying and conferring the rose upon those living outside of Rome was given by the pope to cardinal legates &quot;a latere&quot;, nuncios, inter-nuncios and Apostolic ablegates. In 1895 a new office, called &quot;Bearer of the Golden Rose&quot; or &quot;Keeper of the Golden Rose&quot;, destined for Members of Royal Houses (not hereditary), was instituted, and assigned to a privy chamberlain of sword and cape &quot;de numero participantium&quot;, a rank within the Papal Household, but it was abolished in a series of reforms in 1968 by Pope Paul VI.

== Blessing of the Rose ==
The earliest roses were not blessed; instead, blessing was introduced to render the ceremony more solemn and induce greater reverence for it on the part of the recipient. According to Cardinal Petra (&quot;Comment. in Constit. Apostolicas&quot;, III, 2, col. 1), Pope Innocent IV (1245–54) was the first to bless it. However, others claim that Pope Innocent III (1198–1216), Pope Alexander III (1159–81) or Pope Leo IX (1049–55) was the first. It is said that Leo IX, in 1051, obliged the monastery (nuns) of Bamberg in Franconia, to furnish a Golden Rose to be blessed and carried on Laetare Sunday each year (Theop. Raynaud, &quot;De rosa mediana a pontifice consecrata&quot;, IV, 413). Pope Benedict XIV attests that the ceremony of blessing originated at the end of the 14th or the beginning of the 15th century. Catalanus, papal master of ceremonies, believes that even the earliest roses were anointed with musk and balsam, but the blessing with prayers, incense, and holy water had its inception later on, sometime before pontificate of Pope Julius II (1503–13). Currently, the pope blesses the rose every year, but it is not always a new and different rose; the old one is used until it has been given away.

Originally (before the papacy moved to Avignon) the rose was blessed in the Hall of Vestments (sacristy) in the palace where the pope was; but the solemn Mass and the donation of the rose took place in the Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (a figure, according to Pope Innocent III, of the heavenly Jerusalem). The blessing was followed by a solemn Mass sung either by the pope himself or the first Cardinal Priest. In the former case the rose was placed on a veil of rose-colored silk richly embroidered with gold; in the latter the pope held the rose in his hand, except while kneeling, or during the Introit, Confiteor, Elevation and the singing of &quot;Laudemus in Domino&quot;. Rose in hand, the pope returned processionally to the Lateran Palace; the Prefect of Rome led his horse by the bridle and aided him in dismounting. Upon arrival, he gave the rose to the Prefect, as a recompense for these acts of respect and homage. Before 1305, the rose was given in Rome to no foreigner, except to the Emperor on the day of his coronation. While residing at Avignon (1305–1375), the popes, unable to visit Roman churches and basilicas, performed many of their sacred functions, among them the blessing of the rose, in the private chapel of their palace (whence the origin of the Cappella Pontificia). On their return to Rome they (Sixtus V excepted) retained this custom.
The blessing of the rose now takes place in the Hall of Vestments (camera dei parimenti), and the solemn Mass in the papal chapel. The rose is placed on a table with lighted candles, and the pope, vested in alb and rose-colored stole and cope with precious mitre on his head, begins the ceremony with the usual versicles and the following poetical prayer:

:&quot;O God! by Whose word and power all things have been created, by Whose will all things are directed, we humbly beseech Thy Majesty, Who art the joy and gladness of all the faithful, that Thou wouldst deign in Thy fatherly love to bless and sanctify this rose, most delightful in odour and appearance, which we this day carry in sign of spiritual joy, in order that the people consecrated by Thee and delivered from the yoke of Babylonian slavery through the favour of Thine only-begotten Son, Who is the glory and exultation of the people of Israel and of that Jerusalem which is our Heavenly mother, may with sincere hearts show forth their joy. Wherefore, O Lord, on this day, when the Church exults in Thy name and manifests her joy by this sign [the rose], confer upon us through her true and perfect joy and accepting her devotion of today; do Thou remit sin, strengthen faith, increase piety, protect her in Thy mercy, drive away all things adverse to her and make her ways safe and prosperous, so that Thy Church, as the fruit of good works, may unite in giving forth the perfume of the ointment of that flower sprung from the root of Jesse and which is the mystical flower of the field and lily of the valleys, and remain happy without end in eternal glory together with all the saints.&quot;

The prayer finished, the pope puts incense (handed by the cardinal-deacon) into the censer and incenses the balsam and then the musk, and afterwards puts the balsam and powdered musk into the tiny cup in the heart of the principal rose. He then incenses the rose and sprinkles it with holy water. It is then given to the youngest cleric of the Camera, who carries it in front of the pope to the chapel, where it is placed on the altar at the foot of the cross upon a richly embroidered silk veil, where it remains during the Mass sung by the first cardinal-priest. After the Mass, the rose is carried in procession before the pope to the sacristy, where it is carefully put away in a place set apart for it, until bestowed upon some worthy personage.

==Recipients==

Golden Roses have been awarded to people – men, women, and one married couple - as well as to states and churches.

Until the sixteenth century Golden Roses were usually awarded to male sovereigns. From the sixteenth century onwards it became more common to award them to female sovereigns and to the wives of sovereigns. The last male to receive a Golden Rose was Francesco Loredan, Doge of Venice, in 1759. The last person to receive a Golden Rose was Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, in 1956.

Among the principal churches to which the rose has been presented are St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (five roses), the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (four roses), the Basilica of Our Lady of Aparecida (three roses), and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore (two roses).

* In the twentieth century Pius X, Benedict XV, John XXIII, and John Paul I made no awards of the Golden Rose. 
* Pius XI revived the practice which was continued by Pius XII.
* Paul VI (1963–1978) made five awards
* John Paul II (1978–2005) made ten awards
* Benedict XVI (2005–2013) made nineteen awards
* Francis has made sixteen awards of the Golden Rose during his reign since 2013.

Since Paul VI, all Golden Roses have been awarded to churches; all of Benedict XVI&#x27;s awards were to Marian shrines.

<text>Khwe (also rendered &quot;Kxoe, Khoe&quot; ) is a dialect continuum of the Khoe branch of the Khoe-Kwadi family of Namibia, Angola, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Zambia, with some 8,000 speakers.

== Classification ==
Khwe is a member of the Khoe branch of the larger Khoe-Kwadi language family.

In 2000, the meeting of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in South Africa (WIMSA) produced the Penduka Declaration on the Standardisation of Ju and Khoe Languages, which recommends Khwe be classified as part of the Central Khoe-San family, a cluster language comprising Khwe, ǁAni and Buga.

&quot;Khwe&quot; is the preferred spelling as recommended by the Penduka Declaration, but the language is also referred to as &quot;Kxoe&quot;, &quot;Khoe-dam&quot; and &quot;Khwedam&quot;. &quot;Barakwena, Barakwengo&quot; and &quot;Mbarakwena&quot; refer to speakers of the language and are considered pejorative.

Other names and spellings of ǁAni include &quot;ǀ᪶Anda, Gǀanda, Handá, Gani&quot; and &quot;Tanne&quot; with various combinations of &quot;-kwe/khwe/khoe&quot; and &quot;-dam.&quot;

==History==
The Khwe-speaking population has resided around the &quot;bush&quot; in areas of sub-Saharan Africa for several thousand years. Testimonies from living Khwe speakers note that their ancestors have come from the Tsodilo Hills, in the Okavango Delta, where they primarily used hunter-gatherer techniques for subsistence. These testimonies also indicate that living Khwe speakers feel as though they are land-less, and feel as though the governments of Botswana and Namibia have taken their land and rights to it.

Until the 1970s, the Khwe speaking population lived in areas that were inaccessible to most Westerners in remote parts of Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa. Since then, livelihoods have shifted from primarily from hunter-gatherer to more Westernized practices. The first Bantu-speaking education that Khwe speakers received was in 1970 at a settlement in Mùtcʼiku, a settlement proximate the Okavango River.

Some argue that this put the language in a state of decline, as younger populations learned Bantu languages, such as Tswana. Khwe is learned locally as a second language in Namibia, but the language is being lost in Botswana as speakers shift to Tswana. It is also argued that this has led to a semantic broadening in meaning of words in the Khwe language. For example, &quot;to write&quot;, &quot;ǁgàràá&quot;, was formerly used to describe an &quot;activity the community members perform during healing ceremonies&quot;. The semantic broadening of word meanings has also permeated other parts of Khwe-speaking culture, such as food, animals, and other forms of naming that some argue have introduced nonconformity. Noting this, the original meanings of these words is still understood and used during Khwe cultural practices.

While Khwe-speakers were in minimal contact with the outsiders until 1970, there was limited interaction between the Khwe and missionaries in early and mid-twentieth centuries. The missionaries, for the most part, failed to convert the Khwe-speaking population. The introduction to missionaries, however, introduced Western culture and languages, in addition to Bantu languages.

Despite the influence of Bantu languages in Khwe speakers education, historically, Khwe, and other Khoisan languages, have had linguistic influences on Bantu languages. The Bantu language speakers of the Okavango and Zambezi regions migrated to the area during the Bantu Migration, and came in contact with the native Khoe speakers in the area. Several Bantu languages of this area adapted the clicks of the Khoe languages and integrated them into their phonology, in a reduced manner through paralexification. Some scholars argue that the &quot;contact-induced&quot; changes in Bantu languages have contributed to the general language shift away from Khoe languages, such as Khwe, to Bantu languages because of the increased familiarity in phonology.

== Distribution ==
The Khoe mainly occupy the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Specifically, Khwe speakers primarily live in the western Caprivi area in Namibia, however, the entirety of the Khoe population occupies a much larger geography. Khwe speakers in the western Caprivi are somewhat distant, lexically, from other similar Khoe languages, such as Damara. According to a dialect survey conducted by the University of Namibia&#x27;s Department of African Languages, it was revealed that proto-Damara most likely migrated through the western Caprivi area before the Khwe settled the area, as there is little lexical overlap.

The Khwe speakers&#x27; distribution in the greater Kavango-Zambezi region influenced clicks in Khoisan languages, some argue. The Khwe, and other Khoe language speaking peoples, resided in greater Southern Africa, prior to the great Bantu Migration, which occurred about 5,000 years ago. In this migration, the Bantu speaking population of West and Central Africa, around the Nigeria-Cameroon borderlands, migrated to Southern Africa, and in this process, encountered the native Khwe population. While the Khwe migrated into the Caprivi and greater Kavango-Zambezi region after the Damara, they were certainly there 5,000 years ago when Bantu speakers migrated to the area, and through their linguistic and cultural exchanges, both languages were fundamentally altered. The morphology, syntax, and phonology sections on this page further discuss the changes occurred, and how it has influenced contemporary Khwe.

Today, an estimated 3,700 Khwe speakers live in Namibia, with the vast majority residing in the western region of the Zambezi Region. The largest known Khwe settlements are Mutc&#x27;iku, located adjacent to the Okavango River, and Gudigoa in Botswana.

Noting this, there have been major forced migrations from government pressures that have influenced the contemporary distribution of Khwe speakers. In 1990, 4,000 Xhu- and Khwe-speaking people, including former members of the 31 Battalion (SWATF) who fought under the South African Defence Force in the Namibian War, were settled in a tent town in Schmidtsdrift, South Africa. In 2003, the majority of this community relocated to Platfontein, outside Kimberley, following the Schmidtsdrift Community Land Claim.

==Phonology==

Khwe has 70 phonemic consonants, including 36 clicks, as well as 25 vowel phonemes, including diphthongs and nasalised vowels. Khwe&#x27;s tone system has been analysed as containing 9 syllabic tones (3 register and 6 contour), although more recent proposed analyses identify only 3 lexical tones, high, mid and low, with the mora as the basic unit of phonological structure. Tone sandhi processes are common in Khwe and related languages.

=== Vowels ===

* /o/ is realized as [o] when lengthened, but is realized as [ɔ] if it is pronounced short.
* Three nasal vowels are recognized as /ã ĩ ũ/. A nasal /õ/ also exists, but only in diphthongs as /õã/.
* Nasal diphthongs include /ãĩ, ũĩ, ãũ, õã/.
* /oɛ/ and /uɛ/ are free in variation with /oe/ and /ue/, but only dependent upon speakers.

=== Consonants ===
* /ʃ/ is realized as [ç] only in Buma-Khwe, but as [s] in ǁXo-Khwe and Buga-Khwe, and as [ʃ] in ǁXom-Khwe
* /l/ is only found in borrowings.

=== Click consonants ===
Khoe click inventories generally combine four anterior constrictions types with nine to eleven anterior constrictions. The exact size of the click inventory in Khwe is unclear. Köhler established an inventory of 36 click phonemes, from combinations of four influxes /ǀ ǂ ǃ ǁ/, and nine effluxes (only five on the alveolar), as well as a borrowed voiced alveolar click, /ǃᶢ/. Khwe is the only language to have a pre-nasalized voiced click.

=== Tones ===
There are three tones in Khwe: high /V́/, mid /V̄/, low /V̀/. Long vowels and diphthongs have eight tones (missing only *mid–low as a combination).

== Morphology ==
Khwe is a suffixing language, and thus has a rich inventory of head-marking suffixes on nouns and verbs. Verbs take tense-aspect-mood suffixes (TAMs), marking for causative, applicative, comitative, locative, passive, reflexive and reciprocal. Nouns are marked with person-gender-number suffixes (PGNs). Gender division in Khwe is based on sex, and is expressed by PGNs, with gender being marked even in first-person dual and plural.

Negation in Khwe is indicated with the clause-final negative particle &quot;vé,&quot; which can be used to indicate non-occurrence of an event, non-equation between entities, and the non-possession of an entity. The post-verbal particle &quot;tí&quot; can also be used, although its application is limited to prohibitive functions, such as negative imperatives and the negative hortative and jussive constructions, in which &quot;vé&quot; can also be used.

== Syntax ==
Generally, Khoisan languages have an SV constituent order. Central Khoisan languages have a dominant AOV constituent order, including Khwe, though OAV order is used more frequently in casual conversation and storytelling.

Khwe lacks a separate class of adjectives. Pronouns, nouns and verbs, especially state verbs, can be used attributively. Khwe has a modifier-head order, in which manner adverbs precede the verb, and adjectives and possessors attributes precede the noun.

In Khwe, subjects of intransitive verbs, subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs, and one of the objects of ditransitive verbs are commonly omitted when the participants are known to the speakers through inner- or extra-linguistic context.

Khwe has two multiverbal constructions that may denote a series of closely connected events: serial verb constructions (SVC) and converb constructions. An SVC expresses a complex event composed by two or more single events that happen at the same time, and a converb construction marks the immediate succession of two or more events.

SVCs in Khwe consist of two or more verbs forming a single intonation unit, with only the last verb being marked for TAM. The preceding verbs obligatorily take the active voice suffix. Converb constructions may consist of two or more verbs, only one of which takes the TAM marking.

== Vocabulary ==
In opposition to the postulated linguistic universal regarding the primacy of the visual domain in the hierarchy of the verbs of perception, Khwe&#x27;s most widely applied verb of perception is &quot;ǁám̀&quot;, &#x27;taste, smell, touch&#x27;. Khwe has three verbs of perception, the other two being &quot;mṹũ&quot; &#x27;see&#x27;, and &quot;kóḿ&quot; &#x27;hear&#x27;, but &quot;ǁám̀&quot;, which is semantically rooted in oral perception, is used to convey holistic modes of sensory perception.

The Khwe term &quot;xǀóa&quot; functions both as a verb &#x27;to be little, few, some&#x27; and as an alternative way of expressing the quantity &#x27;three&#x27;. This term is unique in its ambiguity among numeral terms used by African hunter-gatherer subsistence communities.

Khwe has a large number of loan words from Afrikaans.

== Orthography ==
In 1957, Oswin Köhler, founder of the Institut für Afrikanistik at the University of Cologne, designed an orthography of Khwe in which he published three volumes of texts and grammatical sketches, based on observations of language and culture made over 30 years of visits to Namibia. As Köhler&#x27;s orthography was designed for academic purposes, his volumes were published in German and French, and therefore inaccessible to the Khwe themselves. Köhler never made an attempt to teach literacy to members of the community.

Attempts to teach the Khwe orthography to first language speakers were not made until 1996, by scholars of the institute who took up Köhler&#x27;s work. At the request and with the consultation of the Khwe, the orthography was revised and simplified by Matthias Brenzinger and Mathias Schladt between 1996 and 1997.

A collection of Khwe folktales was published in 1999 by Christa Kilian-Hatz and David Naude, using the revised orthography along with interlinear and free translations. Kilian-Hatz also published a dictionary of Khwe, although this is written in the linguistic orthography which uses symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet in place of the Latin script use for the applied orthography.

The revised orthography has not been granted official status in Namibia. The Khwe language is not taught as a subject or used as a language of instruction in formal education, and few literacy materials exist.

<doc id="715496" wikidata="Q830228" url="?curid=715496" title="Tiritiri Matangi Island">
<text>Tiritiri Matangi Island is located in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand, east of the Whangaparāoa Peninsula in the North Island and north east of Auckland. The island is an open nature reserve managed by the Supporters of Tiritiri Matangi Incorporated, under the supervision of the Department of Conservation and is noted for its bird life, including takahē, North Island kōkako and kiwi. It attracts between 30,000 and 32,000 visitors a year, the latter figure being the maximum allowed by the Auckland Conservation Management Strategy.

The name, Māori for &quot;tossed by the wind&quot;, is often popularly shortened to Tiritiri. Māori mythology considers the island to be a float of an ancestral fishing net.

==Geography==

The island is located on the Hibiscus Coast to the east of Whangaparāoa Peninsula, and is composed of ancient greywacke rock.

===Climate===

== History ==

=== Human use ===

The first people to settle on the island were Māori of the Kawerau iwi. Later, members of the Ngāti Pāoa moved to the island, like the Kawerau partly for shark fishing until about 1700, when the Kawerau regained control and remained until forced to retreat to Waikato in 1821 when Hongi Hika attacked from the north. There were two pā, Tiritiri Matangi Pā located to the north of Hobbs Bay, and Papakura Pā, to the north-west of the island.

European (Pākehā) settlers arrived in the early 19th century. In 1841 Ngāti Pāoa sold the land to the crown as part of the Mahurangi Block. When the Kawerau returned, friction ensued as both peoples had a claim to the island. In 1867 the Māori Land Court awarded title to the Crown.

A lighthouse was constructed near the southern end in 1864, and remains in operation. In 1956, a xenon light source was fitted to the lighthouse, creating the most powerful light-beam achieved at the time by a New Zealand lighthouse. It had an output of 11 million candle-power and a range of 58 nautical miles, making it one of the most powerful lights in the world; most lights shone for 27 nautical miles.

The island was farmed from the 1863 to 1971 by the Hobbs family, who also owned land on the peninsula. when the lease expired. Management was then vested in the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park Board.

=== Regeneration and sanctuary ===


While originally forested, the island developed into pasture by the mid-20th century. From 1984, the island has been the focus of a wide-scale native forest regeneration project, where over 250,000 native plants have been propagated on the island. The island was chosen as a unique and protected place to provide a public window for rare New Zealand native birds on the edge of a large city and it also lacked introduced predators such as mustelids which were present on the mainland. At that time, although the island was devoid of suitable habitat and food sources, the hope was that native forest would regenerate naturally. It became apparent that natural afforestation was happening very slowly because a forest can only grow at its margins, and the island was covered mostly with dense grass and bracken fern. A plan was formulated to establish a nursery to collect cuttings and seed in order to expand the small pockets of forest habitat that were left in some of the valleys. Pōhutukawa was chosen as the main tree as it would eventually provide perches and roosts for birds who would then excrete the seed of the fruits that they had been eating, which would then germinate around the pōhutukawa.

The next intervention was eradication in 1993 of the Polynesian rat, known to Māori as &quot;kiore&quot;, which was destroying seedlings and competing with birds for food. The kiore were killed by an aerial drop of poisoned bait, which was controversial due to its lack of planning and the effect on other wildlife. For instance, 90% of pūkeko on the island were killed, though the resident takahē were kept in an enclosure for the duration of the poisoning.

Eighty-seven species of birds have been observed on or near the island. Eleven native species have been translocated to the island as part of the ongoing restoration project. These are red-crowned parakeet (kākāriki, &quot;Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae&quot;), North Island saddleback (tīeke, &quot;Philesturnus rufusater&quot;), brown teal (pāteke, &quot;Anas chlorotis&quot;), whitehead (pōpokotea, &quot;Mohoua albicilla&quot;), takahē (&quot;Porphyrio hochstetteri&quot;), little spotted kiwi (&quot;Apteryx owenii&quot;), stitchbird (hihi, &quot;Notiomystis cincta&quot;), North Island kōkako (&quot;Callaeas wilsoni&quot;), fernbird (mātātā, &quot;Poodytes punctatus&quot;), North Island tomtit (miromiro, &quot;Petroica macrocephala toitoi)&quot;, and rifleman (titipounamu, &quot;Acanthisitta chloris&quot;).

Non-avian translocations include 60 tuatara in 2003, Duvaucel&#x27;s gecko in 2006 and a large insect wetapunga in 2011. Non-native species still present include the Australian brown quail. The success of the conservation project encouraged the creation of a number of similar projects around the Gulf, such as on Motuihe, Motuora and Motutapu. The closest land on the tip of the Whangaparāoa Peninsula, Shakespear Regional Park has recently (2011) also become a mammalian pest-free fenced sanctuary, increasing immigration of the birds on Tiritiri to the nearby mainland.

A ferry service runs from Auckland Ferry Terminal and Gulf Harbour, and guided tours are available.The island has hosted several tens of thousands of conservation volunteers.

<text>Roosevelt &quot;Rosey&quot; Brown Jr. (October 20, 1932 – June 9, 2004) was an American professional football offensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants from 1953 to 1965. He played college football for the Morgan State Bears and was selected by the Giants in the 27th round of the 1953 NFL draft.

Brown appeared in 162 games for the Giants, missing only four games in a 13-year career. In his prime, between 1956 and 1963, he helped lead the Giants to six division championships and the 1956 NFL Championship Game. He was selected as a first-team All-Pro player eight consecutive years and was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl nine times.

After retiring as a player, Brown remained with the Giants as an assistant coach and later as a scout. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975, was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994 and was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019. He was also included on the NFL 1950s All-Decade Team and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1932. Brown recalled his youth as follows:

I was always a big boy. When I was 6, my mother put me in school and I took a test. I must have passed it because they put me in third grade. No first grade and no second grade. That meant I graduated from high school when I was 15 and from college at 19. When I played my first game for the Giants, in 1953, I was still 19.

He attended Jefferson High School, the African American high school in Charlottesville. He played trombone in the school&#x27;s band, having been forbidden to play football after his older brother was injured playing the sport and died. The school&#x27;s football coach, Robert W. Smith, ultimately persuaded the 180-pound Brown to play football, though he did so initially without his father&#x27;s knowledge. Coach Smith said, &quot;The band director almost wanted to fight me for him. He said that &#x27;Rosey&#x27; would be a great trumpet player, and I said he&#x27;d be a great blocker. I just couldn&#x27;t see a 210 pound kid playing the trumpet.&quot;

==College career==
After graduating from high school, Brown attended Morgan State College, a historically black college in Baltimore, on a scholarship to play for the Morgan State Bears football team under head coach Edward P. Hurt. He was selected as an All-Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association player in both 1951 and 1952, and was a co-captain of the 1952 Morgan State team that compiled a 5–4 record.

In December 1952, he was selected by the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; as a first-team offensive tackle on its 1952 All-America team. The &quot;Courier&quot; cited Brown&#x27;s ability to open holes for Morgan State&#x27;s backs and quoted Morgan State coach Hurt saying, &quot;It is my considered opinion that Roosevelt Brown is the best tackle developed at Morgan State in recent years. He has weight, speed and aggressiveness. If some pro team doesn&#x27;t pick him, it will be missing a bet.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Signing and rookie season===
In January 1953, the New York Giants selected Brown in the 27th round (321st overall pick) of the 1953 NFL draft. The Giants drafted Brown after seeing him featured in the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;&#x27;s All-American team. Brown signed a one-year contract for $3,500 on March 25, 1953. Having been picked as the 321st player in the draft, he is considered &quot;one of the biggest steals in draft history.&quot;

As a rookie, Brown appeared in all 12 games for a Giants team that compiled a 3–9 record during the 1953 season. In October 1953, sports writer Earl Wright wrote of Brown: &quot;He is built like a museum statue – slender hips and broad shoulders. But he is no statue on the field. He surprised the Giants by outrunning Arnie Weinmeister, New York&#x27;s fleet defensive tackle, in windsprints.&quot; Brown also gained attention as a rookie for his style, wearing &quot;fancy street clothing&quot; and regularly sporting a mustache, derby hat and umbrella.

===1954 and 1955 seasons===
Brown again started all 12 games for the 1954 and 1955 Giants teams that compiled records of 7–5 and 6–5–1. The Giants teams during these years was overwhelmingly white, and Brown spent most of his time with Emlen Tunnell, the other African-American starter on the team. The two were roommates in New York. On the road, team owner Wellington Mara arranged for the two to stay in private homes with black families rather than staying in the hotels with the white players. Brown later recalled this as a benefit during segregation:

[W]e loved it! Hell, we didn&#x27;t have curfews like the others had. We could do just about anything we wanted to do and didn&#x27;t have any coaches to check on us. We could drink beer in our rooms, have people in, party it up. We had the best deal. It made me kind of angry when segregation ended and we had to stay with the white boys.

===1956 NFL championship===
In 1956, the Giants compiled an 8–3–1 record and won the 1956 NFL Championship Game. Brown played a key role for the Giants&#x27; championship team, blocking for the team&#x27;s backs Frank Gifford (819 rushing yards), Alex Webster (694 rushing yards), and Mel Triplett (515 rushing yards). Sports writer Murray Olderman wrote: &quot;The New York Giants have football&#x27;s greatest ground threat, and Roosevelt Brown, an ultra-fast 245-pounder, is an integral part of it.&quot; Gifford, the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1956, later said: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be in the Hall of Fame if it weren&#x27;t for him. ... The longest run of my career was on a pitchout against Washington. Rosie made a block at the line of scrimmage. I cut it up, and then I&#x27;m running downfield and I look up and I see No. 79 in front of me, and he wiped out another guy.&quot;

At the end of the 1956 season, Brown was unanimously selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), NEA, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Brown was one of only two players to be chosen by all 28 AP voters as a first-team All-NFL player. He was also received the NFL&#x27;s Lineman of the Year award.

===1957–1965===
Brown remained a fixture in the Giants&#x27; offensive line through the 1965 season. In his prime, between 1956 and 1963, he helped lead the team to six division championships and one NFL championship. Brown was known primarily as an offensive tackle but also played on the Giants&#x27; kickoff, kickoff return, punt, punt return, and field goal attempt platoons. He was also known on defense as the &quot;head &#x27;traffic cop&#x27; on New York&#x27;s last-ditch &#x27;goal-line stand&#x27; platoon.&quot;

Brown was also known for his physique. A 1964 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted:

His neck, shoulders and chest are massive. But the body tapers in a heroic way. His waist and buttocks, in proportion to what&#x27;s above, are small. Then come the legs, similarly massive. ... A lady of certain artistic talent has tried numerous times to capture Rosey Brown on her sketch pad. She has never been satisfied with the results. &#x27;I&#x27;m not worthy of the subject,&#x27; she has said. &#x27;I leave him to Michelangelo.&#x27;

In November 1964, at age 32, Brown acknowledged that time was catching up with him: &quot;You lose a step and you&#x27;re done. You know how to do things, but you can&#x27;t do them any more.&quot; Brown lasted one more year, appearing in all 14 games for the 1965 Giants.

In all, Brown appeared in 162 games for the Giants, missing only four games during his 13-year NFL career. Brown was selected as a first-team All-NFL player eight times during his NFL career: 1956 (AP, UPI, NEA, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1957 (AP, UPI, NEA, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1958 (AP, UPI, NEA, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1959 (AP, UPI, NEA, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1960 (UPI, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1961 (AP, UPI, NEA, &quot;Sporting News&quot;); 1962 (AP, UPI); and 1963 (UPI, NEA). He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl nine times: 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1964, and 1965.

While playing with the Giants, Brown and his wife Thelma were residents of Teaneck, New Jersey, where they were neighbors of New York Yankees catcher Elston Howard.

==Coaching and scouting career==
In March 1966, Brown was hospitalized with phlebitis, calling into doubt his ability to continue his playing career. Brown participated in the Giants&#x27; summer camp, but on August 23, 1966, he announced his retirement as a player. The Giants announced at the same time that the team had hired Brown as an assistant coach. He became the Giants&#x27; assistant offensive line coach and was promoted to offensive line coach in 1969. He later worked as a scout for the Giants. As a player, coach and scout, his career with the Giants spanned more than 50 years.

==Honors and halls of fame==
Brown received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport. His honors include the following:
* In August 1969, he was named to the NFL&#x27;s 1950s All-Decade Team.
* In 1974, he was inducted into the Morgan State University Hall of Fame.
* In January 1975, Brown was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
* In April 1979, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.
* In August 1994, he was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team selected by a 15-person panel of NFL and Pro Football Hall of Fame officials, former players, and media representatives.
* In August 1999, Brown was ranked number 57 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.
* In 2010, he was included in the inaugural class of the New York Giants Ring of Honor.
* In 2019 he was named to the 100 year NFL team

==Family and death==
In June 2004, Brown suffered a heart attack while gardening and died at his home in the Columbus section of Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, at age 71. He was survived by his wife, the former Linda Lock, two stepchildren, and two sisters.

<doc id="715527" wikidata="Q80553" url="?curid=715527" title="Norman Johnson (mathematician)">
<text>Norman Woodason Johnson () was a mathematician at Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts.

== Early life and education ==
Norman Johnson was born on in Chicago. His father had a bookstore and published a local newspaper.

Johnson earned his undergraduate mathematics degree in 1953 at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota followed by a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Pittsburgh. After graduating in 1953, Johnson did alternative civilian service as a conscientious objector. He earned his PhD from the University of Toronto in 1966 with a dissertation title of &quot;The Theory of Uniform Polytopes and Honeycombs&quot; under the supervision of H. S. M. Coxeter. From there, he accepted a position in the Mathematics Department of Wheaton College in Massachusetts and taught until his retirement in 1998.

==Career==
In 1966, he enumerated 92 convex non-uniform polyhedra with regular faces. Victor Zalgaller later proved (1969) that Johnson&#x27;s list was complete, and the set is now known as the Johnson solids.

Johnson is also credited with naming all the uniform star polyhedra and their duals, as published in Magnus Wenninger&#x27;s model building books: &quot;Polyhedron models&quot; (1971) and &quot;Dual models&quot; (1983).

== Death and final works==
He completed final edits for his book &quot;Geometries and Transformations&quot; just before his death on , and nearly completed his manuscript on uniform polytopes.
