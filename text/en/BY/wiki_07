<text>The scaly-breasted munia or spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), known in the pet trade as nutmeg mannikin or spice finch, is a sparrow-sized estrildid finch native to tropical Asia. A species of the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot;, it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its name is based on the distinct scale-like feather markings on the breast and belly. The adult is brown above and has a dark conical bill. The species has 11 subspecies across its range, which differ slightly in size and color.

This munia eats mainly grass seeds apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and communicate with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.

The species is endemic to Asia and occurs from India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and the Philippines (where it is called &quot;mayang pakíng&quot;). It has been introduced into many other parts of the world, and feral populations have established in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, as well as parts of Australia, and the United States of America, with sightings in California. The bird is listed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy==
In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the scaly-breasted munia in the first volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;Gowry Bird&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen at the London home of Charles du Bois, treasurer to the East India Company. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the scaly-breasted munia with the crossbills in the genus &quot;Loxia&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Loxia punctulata&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. Linnaeus specified the locality as &quot;Asia&quot; but this was restricted to Kolkata (Calcutta) by E. C. Stuart Baker in 1926. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Henry Sykes in 1832. The genus name &quot;Lonchura&quot; combines the Ancient Greek lonkhē meaning &quot;spear-head&quot; or &quot;lance&quot; with oura meaning &quot;tail&quot;. The specific epithet is from Modern Latin &quot;punctulatus&quot; meaning &quot;spotted&quot; or &quot;dotted&quot;.

Over its large range there are 11 recognised subspecies. These include the nominate form found in the plains of the Indian Subcontinent, including Pakistan, India, Iran, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The name &quot;lineoventer&quot; was formerly used for the Indian population. Other populations include &quot;subundulata&quot; from the eastern Himalayas, &quot;yunnanensis&quot; of southern China, &quot;topela&quot; of Thailand, &quot;cabanisi&quot; of the Philippines and &quot;fretensis&quot; of Singapore and Sumatra. Island populations include &quot;nisoria&quot; (Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa), &quot;particeps&quot; (Sulawesi), &quot;baweana&quot; (Bawean Island), &quot;sumbae&quot; (Sumba) and &quot;blasii&quot; (Flores, Timor and Tanimbar).

==Description==

The scaly-breasted munia is about long and weighs . The adult has a stubby dark bill typical of grain eating birds, brown upperparts and a dark brown head. The underparts are white with dark scale markings. The sexes are similar, although males have darker markings on the underside and a darker throat than females.

Immature birds have pale brown upperparts, lack the dark head found in adults, and have uniform buff underparts that can be confused with juveniles of other munia species such as the tricolored munia (&quot;Lonchura malacca&quot;) across the Asian and island populations and the black-throated munia (&quot;Lonchura kelaarti&quot;) in parts of India or Sri Lanka.

==Distribution and habitat==

Scaly-breasted munias are found in a range of habitats but are usually close to water and grassland. In India, they are especially common in paddy fields where they are considered a minor pest on account of their feeding on grain. They are found mainly on the plains, but can be observed in the foothills of the Himalayas, in which they may be present at altitudes near , and in the Nilgiris, where they are found at altitudes up to during the summer. In Pakistan, they are restricted to a narrow region from Swat in the west to Lahore, avoiding the desert zone, and then occurring again in India east of an area between Ludhiana and Mount Abu. The species has also been observed in Kashmir, though this is rare.

Outside their native range, escaped birds frequently establish themselves in areas with a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby. Escaped cage-birds established in the wild and such populations have been recorded in the West Indies (Puerto Rico since 1971), Hawaii (since 1883), Japan and southern United States, mainly in Florida and California. In Oahu, Hawaii, they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia and tend to be rare where this competitor is present.
The species has been introduced to other parts of the world due to its popularity as a cage bird and populations have established in the wild.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
===Sociality===
Scaly-breasted munias form flocks of as many as 100 birds. Individuals communicate with calls that include a short whistle, variations of &quot;kitty-kitty-kitty&quot;, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.

When roosting communally, scaly-breasted munia sit side by side in close contact with each other. The outermost bird often jostles towards the center. Birds in a flock sometimes preen each other, with the soliciting bird usually showing its chin. Allopreening is usually limited to the face and neck. The scaly-breasted munia is rarely hostile but birds will sometimes quarrel without any ritualized posturing.

===Breeding===

The breeding season is during the summer rainy season (mainly June to August and also in October season in India) but can vary. Laboratory studies have found that long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the &quot;slope&quot; posture—erect with the head feathers raised.

There are two types of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an ordinary one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zigzag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering. The nest is a large domed structure loosely woven from blades of grass, bamboo or other leaves with a side entrance and is placed in a tree or under the eaves of a house. A study in southern India found the preferred nesting trees to be &quot;Toddalia asiatica&quot;, &quot;Gymnosporia montana&quot; and &quot;Acacia chundra&quot;, especially short and bushy ones in areas with low canopy cover. The nest opening is located to face downwind of the most frequent wind direction. In northern India, they preferred isolated &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot; in non-urban areas but used &quot;Thuja orientalis&quot; and &quot;Polyalthia longifolia&quot; in urban gardens.

Scaly-breasted munia clutches usually contain 4 to 6 eggs, but can contain up to 10. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs, which hatch in 10 to 16 days.

The species is extensively used as a brood host by the parasitic pin-tailed whydah in Southern California — where both species are feral — with the munia raising the whydah&#x27;s chicks as its own. This relationship is novel, as the two species do not naturally co-occur in their native ranges, and had no established evolutionary relationship as parasite and host.

== Food and foraging ==

The scaly-breasted munia feeds mainly on grass seeds, small berries such as those of &quot;Lantana&quot; and insects. Although the bill is suited for crushing small grains, they do not show lateral movements of the lower mandible which help European greenfinches in dehusking seeds. Like some other munias, they may also feed on algae, a rich protein source, prior to the breeding season.

The ease of maintaining these birds in captivity has made them popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.

===Flock size tradeoffs===
Studies on foraging have examined the effect of group size in reducing time spent on predator vigilance, thereby increasing feeding efficiency. According to the &quot;many-eyes&quot; hypothesis, a reduction in the individual time spent on vigilance against threats in larger groups allows for more time to be spent on searching for food and feeding. Vigilance is greatest among solitary individuals and reduces as the group size increases to about four. The birds collect seeds more quickly in larger groups, reflecting a decrease in individual vigilance, a decrease in handling time, and an increase in both search speed and focus when foraging.
Individuals may also take advantage of group foraging by &quot;joining&quot; members that have found food. The options to seek food or to join others that have discovered food involves information sharing and has been studied through what are termed &quot;producer-scrounger models&quot;. A cost associated with group foraging is increased resource competition, which in turn may reduce anti-predatory vigilance due to the intensity of foraging. Some studies show that increased competition results in a decreased feeding rate.

===Foraging models===
When foraging, scaly-breasted munia can search as individuals or search for others that have found food and join them. The economic consequences of the decision to join others has been modeled in two ways: the producer-scrounger model and the information sharing model. These models are based on hypotheses that differ in the degree of compatibility that is assumed between the two food and joining opportunity search modes.

The information sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model assumes that the search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird&#x27;s joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.

Studies show that scaly-breasted munias tend to adopt the scrounger tactic when food is more clumped and when the group size increases. When most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to discover new food patches is greater.

===Vigilance===
Most social foragers must search for food while also avoiding predators. It has been suggested that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic has been shown to be associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.

===Specialized foraging===
Scaly-breasted munias have variable competitive behaviors that allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.
Three hypotheses might account for consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ in their ability to use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.

Aviary experiments conducted with captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals are free to choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies have been shown to converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.

Furthermore, foraging birds may feed actively on the substrate or pick grains dropped on the ground and these strategies may be chosen according to the situation. Early departures occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller.

===Prey crypsis===
Since producers search for food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, the presence of a competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cryptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.

===Resource defence===
Recent models of economic defence in a group-foraging context predict that the frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, and the effect of changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted decrease in the number of aggressive encounters.

==Conservation==
The scaly-breasted munia is an abundant species and classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The species occupies an extremely large range, and its population, while still unquantified, is large and stable. The scaly-breasted munia is not globally threatened and is common to very common throughout most of its range. However, some populations are dwindled due to the increase of bird cagings.

In many areas it is regarded as an agricultural pest, feeding in large flocks on cultivated cereals such as rice. In Southeast Asia, the scaly-breasted munia is trapped in large numbers for Buddhist life release rituals. While most birds are eventually released, the post-release mortality rate can be as high as 90%.

<text>Stuart Douglas Barnes (born December 25, 1970) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward. He played 16 seasons at centre in the NHL with the Winnipeg Jets, Florida Panthers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Buffalo Sabres, and Dallas Stars. He currently has an arena named after him in the city of Spruce Grove, where he was born. Barnes was an assistant coach with the Dallas Stars. , he is the head coach and co-owner of the Tri-City Americans in the Western Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Barnes was drafted fourth overall by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. On November 25, 1993, the Jets traded him along with a sixth round selection (previously acquired from the St. Louis Blues; Chris Kibermanis) in 1994 to the Florida Panthers for Randy Gilhen. In Florida, he was among the leaders on the teams, who helped carry the Panthers to the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals, facing the Colorado Avalanche. Then on November 19, 1996, the Pittsburgh Penguins traded Chris Wells to the Panthers for Barnes and Jason Woolley. The trade to the Penguins has been considered the worst in Panthers history.

In 1999, Barnes was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for Matthew Barnaby. In Buffalo, he went to the Finals again, this time against Dallas, only to lose on a triple-overtime goal by Brett Hull. He served as the captain for the Sabres before being traded to the Stars in 2003 for Michael Ryan and a second round draft pick in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. When Mike Modano was injured during the 2006–07 season, Barnes served as an alternate captain of the Stars. He also served as an alternate captain for most of the 2007–08 season due to Sergei Zubov&#x27;s absence from the line-up.

Barnes announced his retirement as a player on August 28, 2008 and joined the Stars as an assistant coach for three seasons before becoming a hockey operations consultant.

Barnes left the Stars front office after the 2012–13 season, and went on to serve in a dual capacity as the Tri-City Americans co-owner in the Western Hockey League and as the head coach of the Okanagan Academy Prep hockey team.

In 2017, Barnes returned to the Dallas Stars organization as an assistant coach.

<doc id="693195" wikidata="Q3298620" url="?curid=693195" title="Jennifer Peña">
<text>Jennifer Marcella Peña (born September 17, 1983) is a Grammy Awards and Latin Grammy Awards nominated Mexican American Tejano/Latin pop singer known as &quot;The Princess of Tejano&quot;. Peña reached a milestone in her career of over 3.5 million records sold internationally. Peña was born in San Antonio, Texas, and is the third and youngest daughter of Jaime and Mary Peña with other sisters Janet and Jackie. Peña is of Mexican descent native to the state of Texas.

== Career ==
=== Los Jetz ===
Peña first achieved notoriety after performing at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, during a Selena Quintanilla tribute concert in 1995. The event was Peña&#x27;s first public performance, on a large scale, during which she performed the song &quot;Bidi Bidi Bom Bom&quot;, one of Selena&#x27;s No. 1 hits from the year prior (1994). At the time, Peña&#x27;s music career was managed by Q-Productions and Abraham Quintanilla Jr., the late Selena&#x27;s father and former manager. Peña&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Dulzura&quot;, was released in May 1996 as part of Jennifer y Los Jetz and was produced by Abraham Quintanilla. The record introduced her to the music scene, officially, at the age of 12; the title track, and &quot;Ven a mí&quot; (or &#x27;Come to me&#x27;, a Spanish-language cover of The Drifters song &quot;Dance with Me&quot;), garnered her a loyal fanbase. The album sold quite well in the Latin music market, was certified gold and won several Tejano Music Awards. At the time, Tejano music was in its heyday, and Peña was another young, staple act on the scene. Her introduction was both praised and criticized, mainly in part due to the artistic (and physical) similarities between Selena and herself, despite Selena&#x27;s own father managing her career. Reviews and comparisons came and went, and still, Peña managed to continue winning over fans. In 1997, she released her second album, &quot;Jennifer Y Los Jetz&quot;, with the singles &quot;Tu Castigo&quot; (&#x27;your punishment&#x27;) and &quot;Yo Te Vi&quot; (&#x27;I saw you&#x27;) being promoted and experiencing much of the same success as &quot;Dulzura&quot; had achieved. The album ended up earning another gold certification. Los Jetz was composed of musicians who are still in the music business, to this day, including Lucky Joe Eguia (who is now a Freddie Records solo recording artist), Joey Jimenez (&#x27;JMZ&#x27;, who has become one of Tejano&#x27;s most praised drummers), and Lalo Reyna (husband and band director for Elida Reyna).
In 1998, Peña released &quot;Mariposa&quot; with &quot;Tengo Miedo&quot; (&#x27;I’m scared&#x27;) as the lead single, another hit on the Latin market; in México, where she toured extensively, the album became Peña&#x27;s third to be certified gold. By 2000, Peña was the most prominent female Tejano singer, and had been long-dubbed &quot;La Princesa de la Música Tejana&quot; (the princess of Tejano music). Her most commercially- and critically-acclaimed album, while under Q&#x27;s management, was 2000&#x27;s &quot;Abrázame y Bésame&quot; (&quot;hug me and kiss me&quot;), for which Peña was billed as a solo act but still performing with Los Jetz. The album, as her previous, was produced by A.B. Quintanilla. Showcasing a more mature sound for the singer, the title track—a duet with former Kumbia Kings frontman DJ Kane—was the most successful single. Other songs, like &quot;Si Tú Te Vas&quot; (&#x27;if you go&#x27;), &quot;Contigo Otra Vez&quot; (&#x27;with you again&#x27;) and &quot;No Te Voy a Perdonar&quot; (&#x27;I’m not going to lose you&#x27;), resonated strongly in the US and in Mexico, garnering her a 2001 Grammy nomination and multiple Tejano Music Awards. Peña continued to promote and tour extensively after the release of every album under Q&#x27;s management, and under EMI Latin.

=== Univision Music Group and Latin pop venture ===
After a few years of management under Q Productions, Peña signed with new label Univision Music Group, whose president had launched Selena&#x27;s career while at EMI Latin, which he headed until 2000.

In 2002, Peña released &quot;Libre&quot;, produced by Rudy Pérez and Kike Santander. Rudy Pérez wrote the album&#x27;s biggest hits: &quot;Vamos al Mundial&quot;, which was chosen as the anthem for the 2002 FIFA World Cup on Univision; and &quot;El Dolor de Tu Presencia&quot;, which catapulted Peña&#x27;s popularity, spending eight consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Latin Tracks. &quot;Entre el Delirio y la Locura&quot; soon followed. &quot;Libre&quot; sold over 300,000 units. In 2003, &quot;Libre&quot; was nominated for a Grammy.

In 2004, Peña released her second album with UMG, &quot;Seducción&quot;, which was produced by Rudy Pérez, Gustavo and Kike Santander, and Emilio Estefan. Rudy Pérez was the genius behind another #1 hit, &quot;Vivo y Muero en Tu Piel&quot;. The album kept up the momentum of her previous release, again selling over 300,000 units.

In 2004, Peña performed to a crowd of over 61,000 fans at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a venue known for hosting major acts such as the Dixie Chicks, Garth Brooks, and Beyoncé. She also recorded a live album which was released later that same year. Following her commercial success, Peña performed for former United States President Bill Clinton and then current President President George W. Bush in 2006. She is actively involved with awareness campaigns of hepatitis, AIDS, and teen depression.

Peña has ventured into film, appearing in MTV&#x27;s &quot;All You&#x27;ve Got&quot; (2006) with Ciara. She also appeared in Amexicano (2007).

On , &quot;Dicen que el tiempo&quot; was released, debuting at #16 on Billboard Top Latin Albums, with &quot;Como Entender&quot; being promoted as the first single, followed by &quot;Tuya&quot; in late April 2007. Since the release, both the album and single have garnered only a lukewarm reception, despite cracking the Top 25 positions on Billboard and selling out the initial shipment of 80,000 units. Peña is on hiatus after having promoted the album all across the US and Puerto Rico with TV slots on MTV Tr3s as the artist of the month and extensive radio promotion. The second single, &quot;Tuya&quot;, reached its peak position at #5 on Billboard charts as of September 2007. &quot;Dicen Que El Tiempo&quot; did not fare well in sales in comparison to previous efforts but did win Peña critical acclaim and was well received by fans. The album, although a departure from both her Pop Ballads and Tejano Sound, was produced by Jennifer and Sebastian Kyrs, with additional songwriting and production by Obie Bermúdez. On December 6, 2007, &quot;Dicen Que El Tiempo&quot; was nominated for a Grammy.

== Personal life ==
In April 2007, Peña announced her engagement to Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Obie Bermúdez, and that they were expecting their first child. They shared their good news again during an appearance on April 26, 2007, edition of &quot;Mi TRL&quot; on MTV Tr3s. The couple was married in a private ceremony in her home state of Texas on June 3, 2007. The couple welcomed their first child, a son, in November 2007. She later had a daughter, and third child in 2019. Jennifer and her husband formally separated in 2023 and the divorce was final in 2024. Which has led her return to music after a long hiatus. Peña, before the divorce and separation, had joined Church Unlimited&#x27;s Praise &amp; Worship team where she was welcomed and loved. Separation with the church ended abruptly years after her dedication to the church, with Jennifer having plans of returning to Tejano Music while continuing to have the love and passion of God in her heart. In 2024, Peña started a tour alongside Grupo Siggno named &quot;Casate Conmigo&quot; Tour. Currently Peña resides in Texas and is now performing in Texas and Mexico.

<text>In computability theory, the μ-operator, minimization operator, or unbounded search operator searches for the least natural number with a given property. Adding the μ-operator to the primitive recursive functions makes it possible to define all computable functions.

== Definition ==
Suppose that R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is a fixed (&quot;k&quot;+1)-ary relation on the natural numbers. The μ-operator &quot;μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;, in either the unbounded or bounded form, is a &quot;number theoretic function&quot; defined from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. However, &quot;μ&quot;y&quot;&quot; contains a &quot;predicate&quot; over the natural numbers, which can be thought of as a condition that evaluates to &quot;true&quot; when the predicate is satisfied and &quot;false&quot; when it is not.

The &quot;bounded&quot; μ-operator appears earlier in Kleene (1952) &quot;Chapter IX Primitive Recursive Functions, §45 Predicates, prime factor representation&quot; as:
:&quot;formula_1&quot; (p. 225)

Stephen Kleene notes that any of the six inequality restrictions on the range of the variable &quot;y&quot; is permitted, i.e. &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;, &quot;w&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot;, &quot;w&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;, &quot;w&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; and &quot;w&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;. &quot;When the indicated range contains no &quot;y&quot; such that R(&quot;y&quot;) [is &quot;true&quot;], the value of the &quot;μ&quot;y&quot;&quot; expression is the cardinal number of the range&quot; (p. 226); this is why the default &quot;z&quot; appears in the definition above. As shown below, the bounded μ-operator &quot;μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;&quot; is defined in terms of two primitive recursive functions called the finite sum Σ and finite product Π, a predicate function that &quot;does the test&quot; and a representing function that converts {t, f} to {&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;}.

In Chapter XI §57 General Recursive Functions, Kleene defines the &quot;unbounded&quot; μ-operator over the variable &quot;y&quot; in the following manner,
:&quot;formula_2&quot; (p. 279, where &quot;formula_3&quot; means &quot;there exists a &quot;y&quot; such that...&quot;)

In this instance R itself, or its representing function, delivers &quot;0&quot; when it is satisfied (i.e. delivers &quot;true&quot;); the function then delivers the number &quot;y&quot;. No upper bound exists on &quot;y&quot;, hence no inequality expressions appear in its definition.

For a given R(&quot;y&quot;) the unbounded μ-operator μ&quot;y&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;) (note no requirement for &quot;formula_3&quot; ) is a partial function. Kleene makes it as a total function instead (cf. p. 317):

formula_5

The total version of the unbounded μ-operator is studied in &quot;higher-order&quot; reverse mathematics () in the following form:

formula_6

where the superscripts mean that &quot;n&quot; is zeroth-order, &quot;f&quot; is first-order, and μ is second-order. This axiom gives rise to the Big Five system ACA0 when combined with the usual base theory of higher-order reverse mathematics.

== Properties ==

(i) In context of the primitive recursive functions, where the search variable &quot;y&quot; of the μ-operator is bounded, e.g. &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; in the formula below, if the predicate R is primitive recursive (Kleene Proof #E p. 228), then
: μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n) is a primitive recursive function.

(ii) In the context of the (total) recursive functions, where the search variable &quot;y&quot; is &quot;unbounded&quot; but guaranteed to exist for &quot;all&quot; values &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; of the total recursive predicate R&#x27;s parameters,
:(&quot;x&quot;1)...,(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) formula_3 R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) implies that μ&quot;y&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a total recursive function.
:Here (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;) means &quot;for all &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot; and formula_8 means &quot;there exists at least one value of &quot;y&quot; such that...&quot; (cf Kleene (1952) p. 279.)

then the five primitive recursive operators plus the unbounded-but-total μ-operator give rise to what Kleene called the &quot;general&quot; recursive functions (i.e. total functions defined by the six recursion operators).

(iii) In the context of the partial recursive functions: Suppose that the relation R holds if and only if a partial recursive function converges to zero. And suppose that that partial recursive function converges (to something, not necessarily zero) whenever μ&quot;y&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is defined and &quot;y&quot; is μ&quot;y&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) or smaller. Then the function μ&quot;y&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;) is also a partial recursive function.
The μ-operator is used in the characterization of the computable functions as the μ recursive functions.

In constructive mathematics, the unbounded search operator is related to Markov&#x27;s principle.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: The bounded μ-operator is a primitive recursive function ===

:&quot;In the following&quot; x &quot;represents the string&quot; &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

The &quot;bounded&quot; μ-operator can be expressed rather simply in terms of two primitive recursive functions (hereafter &quot;prf&quot;) that also are used to define the CASE function—the product-of-terms Π and the sum-of-terms Σ (cf Kleene #B page 224). (As needed, any boundary for the variable such as &quot;s&quot; ≤ &quot;t&quot; or &quot;t&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot;, or 5 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; 17 etc. is appropriate). For example:
:*Π&quot;s&quot;≤&quot;t&quot; f&quot;s&quot;(x, &quot;s&quot;) = f0(x, 0) × f1(x, 1) × ... × ft(x, &quot;t&quot;)
:*Σ&quot;t&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot; g&quot;t&quot;(x, &quot;t&quot;) = g0(x, 0) + g1(x, 1) + ... + gz-1(x, &quot;z&quot;-1)

Before we proceed we need to introduce a function ψ called &quot;the representing function&quot; of predicate R. Function ψ is defined from inputs (t = &quot;truth&quot;, f = &quot;falsity&quot;) to outputs (0, 1) (&quot;note the order!&quot;). In this case the input to ψ. i.e. {t, f}. is coming from the output of R:
:* ψ(R = t) = 0
:* ψ(R = f) = 1

Kleene demonstrates that μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;) is defined as follows; we see the product function Π is acting like a Boolean OR operator, and the sum Σ is acting somewhat like a Boolean AND but is producing {Σ≠0, Σ=0} rather than just {1, 0}:
: μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;R(&quot;y&quot;) = Σ&quot;t&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;Π&quot;s&quot;≤&quot;t&quot; ψ(R(x, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;s&quot;)) =
: [ψ(x, 0, 0)] +
: [ψ(x, 1, 0) × ψ(x, 1, 1)] +
: [ψ(x, 2, 0) × ψ(x, 2, 1) × ψ(x, 2, 2)] +
: [ψ(x, &quot;z&quot;-1, 0) × ψ(x, &quot;z&quot;-1, 1) × ψ(x, &quot;z&quot;-1, 2) × . . . × ψ (x, &quot;z&quot;-1, &quot;z&quot;-1)]

:Note that &quot;Σ is actually a primitive recursion with the base&quot; Σ(x, 0) = 0 &quot;and the induction step&quot; Σ(x, &quot;y&quot;+1) = Σ(x, &quot;y&quot;) + Π( x, &quot;y&quot;). &quot;The product Π is also a primitive recursion with base step&quot; Π(x, 0) = ψ(x, 0) &quot;and induction step&quot; Π(x, &quot;y&quot;+1) = Π(x, &quot;y&quot;) × ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;+1).

The equation is easier if observed with an example, as given by Kleene. He just made up the entries for the representing function ψ(R(&quot;y&quot;)). He designated the representing functions χ(&quot;y&quot;) rather than ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;):
=== Example 2: The unbounded μ-operator is not primitive-recursive ===
The unbounded μ-operator—the function μ&quot;y&quot;—is the one commonly defined in the texts. But the reader may wonder why the unbounded μ-operator is searching for a function R(x, &quot;y&quot;) to yield &quot;zero&quot;, rather than some other natural number.
:&quot;In a footnote Minsky does allow his operator to terminate when the function inside produces a match to the parameter&quot; &quot;k&quot;; &quot;this example is also useful because it shows another author&#x27;s format:&quot;
::&quot;For μ&quot;t&quot;[φ(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;k&quot;]&quot; (p. 210)

The reason for &quot;zero&quot; is that the unbounded operator μ&quot;y&quot; will be defined in terms of the function &quot;product&quot; Π with its index &quot;y&quot; allowed to &quot;grow&quot; as the μ-operator searches. As noted in the example above, the product Π&quot;x&quot;&lt;&quot;y&quot; of a string of numbers ψ(x, 0) *, ..., * ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;) yields zero whenever one of its members ψ(x, &quot;i&quot;) is zero:
:Π&quot;s&quot;&lt;&quot;y&quot; = ψ(x, 0) * , ..., * ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;) = 0

if any ψ(x, &quot;i&quot;) = 0 where 0≤&quot;i&quot;≤&quot;s&quot;. Thus the Π is acting like a Boolean AND.

The function μ&quot;y&quot; produces as &quot;output&quot; a single natural number &quot;y&quot; = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. However, inside the operator one of a couple &quot;situations&quot; can appear: (a) a &quot;number-theoretic function&quot; χ that produces a single natural number, or (b) a &quot;predicate&quot; R that produces either {t = true, f = false}. (And, in the context of &quot;partial&quot; recursive functions Kleene later admits a third outcome: &quot;μ = undecided&quot;.)

Kleene splits his definition of the unbounded μ-operator to handle the two situations (a) and (b). For situation (b), before the predicate R(x, &quot;y&quot;) can serve in an arithmetic capacity in the product Π, its output {t, f} must first be &quot;operated on&quot; by its &quot;representing function χ&quot; to yield {0, 1}. And for situation (a) if one definition is to be used then the &quot;number theoretic function χ&quot; must produce zero to &quot;satisfy&quot; the μ-operator. With this matter settled, he demonstrates with single &quot;Proof III&quot; that either types (a) or (b) together with the five primitive recursive operators yield the (total) recursive functions, with this proviso for a total function:
: &quot;For all parameters&quot; x, &quot;a demonstration must be provided to show that a &quot;y&quot; exists that satisfies (a)&quot; μ&quot;y&quot;ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;)&quot; or (b)&quot; μ&quot;y&quot;R(x, &quot;y&quot;).
Kleene also admits a third situation (c) that does not require the demonstration of &quot;for all x a &quot;y&quot; exists such that ψ(x, &quot;y&quot;).&quot; He uses this in his proof that more total recursive functions exist than can be enumerated; c.f. footnote Total function demonstration.

Kleene&#x27;s proof is informal and uses an example similar to the first example, but first he casts the μ-operator into a different form that uses the &quot;product-of-terms&quot; Π operating on function χ that yields a natural number &quot;n&quot;, which can be any natural number, and 0 in the instance when the u-operator&#x27;s test is &quot;satisfied&quot;.

:The definition recast with the Π-function:
:μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;χ(&quot;y&quot;) =
:*(i): π(x, &quot;y&quot;) = Π&quot;s&quot;&lt;&quot;y&quot;χ(x, &quot;s&quot;)
:*(ii): φ(x) = τ(π(x, &quot;y&quot;), π(x, &quot;y&#x27; &quot;), &quot;y&quot;)
:*(iii): τ(&quot;z&#x27; &quot;, 0, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; ;τ(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) is undefined for &quot;u&quot; = 0 or &quot;v&quot; &gt; 0.

This is subtle. At first glance the equations seem to be using primitive recursion. But Kleene has not provided us with a base step and an induction step of the general form:
:* base step: φ(0, x) = φ(x)
:* induction step: φ(0, x) = ψ(y, φ(0,x), x)

To see what is going on, we first have to remind ourselves that we have assigned a parameter (a natural number) to every variable &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Second, we do see a successor-operator at work iterating &quot;y&quot; (i.e. the &quot;y&#x27; &quot;). And third, we see that the function μ&quot;y&quot; &quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;χ(&quot;y&quot;, x) is just producing instances of χ(&quot;y&quot;,x) i.e. χ(0,x), χ(1,x), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(&quot;n&quot;, x) yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π(x, &quot;y&#x27; &quot;) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term &quot;v&quot; = 0, μ&quot;y&quot;&quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;z&quot;χ(&quot;y&quot;) executes line (iii) and &quot;exits&quot;. Kleene&#x27;s presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents an &quot;exit&quot;—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a &quot;y&quot; to satisfy χ(&quot;y&quot;) and the middle product-term π(x, &quot;y&#x27; &quot;) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(&quot;z&#x27; &quot;, 0, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;.
: τ(π(x, &quot;y&quot;), π(x, &quot;y&#x27; &quot;), &quot;y&quot;), i.e.:
:* τ(π(x, 0), π(x, 1), 0),
:* τ(π(x, 1), π(x, 2), 1)
:* τ(π(x, 2), π(x, 3), 2)
:* τ(π(x, 3), π(x, 4), 3)
:* ... until a match occurs at &quot;y&quot;=&quot;n&quot; and then:
:* τ(&quot;z&#x27; &quot;, 0, &quot;y&quot;) = τ(&quot;z&#x27; &quot;, 0, &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; and the μ-operator&#x27;s search is done.

For the example Kleene &quot;...consider[s] any fixed values of (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and write[s] simply &#x27;χ(&quot;y&quot;)&#x27; for &#x27;χ(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;), &quot;y&quot;)&#x27;&quot;:

=== Example 3: Definition of the unbounded μ-operator in terms of an abstract machine ===

Both Minsky (1967) p. 21 and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p. 60-61 provide definitions of the μ-operator as an abstract machine; see footnote Alternative definitions of μ.

The following demonstration follows Minsky without the &quot;peculiarity&quot; mentioned in the footnote. The demonstration will use a &quot;successor&quot; counter machine model closely related to the Peano Axioms and the primitive recursive functions. The model consists of (i) a finite state machine with a TABLE of instructions and a so-called &#x27;state register&#x27; that we will rename &quot;the Instruction Register&quot; (IR), (ii) a few &quot;registers&quot; each of which can contain only a single natural number, and (iii) an instruction set of four &quot;commands&quot; described in the following table:

:&quot;In the following, the symbolism &quot; [ r ] &quot; means &quot;the contents of&quot;, and &quot; →r &quot; indicates an action with respect to register r.&quot;

The algorithm for the minimization operator μ&quot;y&quot;[φ(x, &quot;y&quot;)] will, in essence, create a sequence of instances of the function φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) as the value of parameter &quot;y&quot; (a natural number) increases; the process will continue (see Note † below) until a match occurs between the output of function φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) and some pre-established number (usually 0). Thus the evaluation of φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) requires, at the outset, assignment of a natural number to each of its variables x and an assignment of a &quot;match-number&quot; (usually 0) to a register &quot;&quot;w&quot;, and a number (usually 0) to register &quot;y&quot;.

:&quot;Note †: The &quot;unbounded&quot; μ-operator will continue this attempt-to-match process ad infinitum or until a match occurs. Thus the &quot;y&quot;&quot; register must be unbounded -- it must be able to &quot;hold&quot; a number of arbitrary size. Unlike a &quot;real&quot; computer model, abstract machine models allow this. In the case of a &quot;bounded&quot; μ-operator, a lower-bounded μ-operator would start with the contents of &quot;y&quot; set to a number other than zero. An upper-bounded μ-operator would require an additional register &quot;ub&quot; to contain the number that represents the upper bound plus an additional comparison operation; an algorithm could provide for both lower- and upper bounds.&quot;

In the following we are assuming that the Instruction Register (IR) encounters the μ&quot;y&quot; &quot;routine&quot; at instruction number &quot;&quot;n&quot;. Its first action will be to establish a number in a dedicated &quot;w&quot;&quot; register—an &quot;example of&quot; the number that function φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) must produce before the algorithm can terminate (classically this is the number zero, but see the footnote about the use of numbers other than zero). The algorithm&#x27;s next action at instructiton &quot;&quot;n&quot;+1&quot; will be to clear the &quot;&quot;y&quot; register -- &quot;y&quot;&quot; will act as an &quot;up-counter&quot; that starts from 0. Then at instruction &quot;&quot;n&quot;+2&quot; the algorithm evaluates its function φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) -- we assume this takes &quot;j&quot; instructions to accomplish—and at the end of its evaluation φ(x, y) deposits its output in register &quot;φ&quot;. At the (&quot;n&quot;+&quot;j&quot;+3)rd instruction the algorithm compares the number in the &quot;w&quot; register (e.g. 0) to the number in the &quot;φ&quot; register—if they are the same the algorithm has succeeded and it escapes through &quot;exit&quot;; otherwise it increments the contents of the &quot;y&quot; register and &quot;loops&quot; back with this new y-value to test function φ(x, &quot;y&quot;) again.

=== Total function demonstration ===

What is &quot;mandatory&quot; if the function is to be a total function is a demonstration &quot;by some other method&quot; (e.g. induction) that for each and every combination of values of its parameters &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; some natural number &quot;y&quot; will satisfy the μ-operator so that the algorithm that represents the calculation can terminate:
:&quot;...we must always hesitate to assume that a system of equations really defines a general-recursive (i.e. total) function. We normally require auxiliary evidence for this, e.g. in the form of an inductive proof that, for each argument value, the computation terminates with a unique value.&quot; (Minsky (1967) p.186)

:&quot;In other words, we should not claim that a function is effectively calculable on the ground that it has been shown to be general (i.e. total) recursive, unless the demonstration that it is general recursive is effective.&quot;(Kleene (1952) p.319)

For an example of what this means in practice see the examples at mu recursive functions—even the simplest truncated subtraction algorithm &quot;&quot;x&quot; - &quot;y&quot; = &quot;d&quot;&quot; can yield, for the undefined cases when &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, (1) no termination, (2) no numbers (i.e. something wrong with the format so the yield is not considered a natural number), or (3) deceit: wrong numbers in the correct format. The &quot;proper&quot; subtraction algorithm requires careful attention to all the &quot;cases&quot;
:(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = {(0, 0), (&quot;a&quot;, 0), (0, &quot;b&quot;), (&quot;a&quot;≥&quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), (&quot;a&quot;=&quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), (&quot;a&quot;&lt;&quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)}.

But even when the algorithm has been shown to produce the expected output in the instances {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)}, we are left with an uneasy feeling until we can devise a &quot;convincing demonstration&quot; that the cases (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) &quot;all&quot; yield the expected results. To Kleene&#x27;s point: is our &quot;demonstration&quot; (i.e. the algorithm that is our demonstration) convincing enough to be considered &quot;effective&quot;?

=== Alternative abstract machine models of the unbounded μ-operator from Minsky (1967) and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) ===

The unbounded μ-operator is defined by Minsky (1967) p. 210 but with a peculiar flaw: the-operator will not yield &quot;t&quot;=0 when its predicate (the IF-THEN-ELSE test) is satisfied; rather it yields &quot;t&quot;=2. In Minsky&#x27;s version the counter is &quot;t&quot;, and the function φ(&quot;t&quot;, x) deposits its number in register φ. In the usual μ definition register &quot;w&quot; will contain 0, but Minsky observes that it can contain any number &quot;k&quot;. Minsky&#x27;s instruction set is equivalent to the following where &quot;JNE&quot; = Jump to z if Not Equal:
:{ CLR (&quot;r&quot;), INC (&quot;r&quot;), JNE (&quot;r&quot;&quot;j&quot;, &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) }

The unbounded μ-operator is also defined by Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) p. 60-61 for a counter machine with an instruction set equivalent to the following:
: { CLR (r), INC (r), DEC (r), JZ (r, z), H }

In this version the counter &quot;y&quot; is called &quot;r2&quot;, and the function f( x, r2 ) deposits its number in register &quot;r3&quot;. Perhaps the reason Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey clear r3 is to facilitate an unconditional jump to &quot;loop&quot;; this is often done by use of a dedicated register &quot;0&quot; that contains &quot;0&quot;:

<doc id="693202" wikidata="Q537536" url="?curid=693202" title="Warm front">
<text>A warm front is a density discontinuity located at the leading edge of a homogeneous warm air mass, and is typically located on the equator-facing edge of an isotherm gradient. Warm fronts lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts, and move more slowly than the cold fronts which usually follow because cold air is denser and less easy to remove from the Earth&#x27;s surface. This also forces temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. 
Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform, and rainfall generally increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after frontal passage. If the warm air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of semicircles pointing in the direction of travel.

==Development==
Air masses are large bodies of air with similar properties of temperature and humidity that form over source regions. The warm air mass behind a warm front is not only warmer, but often (but not always) also higher in humidity than the colder air preceding it. Because of a warm air mass’s higher temperature and thus lesser density, mixing between the two air masses is unlikely. Being light, the warm air mass is unable to displace the cooler air mass and instead is forced upward along the upper boundary of the colder air in a process known as overrunning. The boundary between the two air masses has a gradual slope of 1:200 and lifting is slow but persistent.

As the air mass rises into regions of lower pressure, it expands and cools. As it cools, any water vapor that is present will condense and form extensive cloud cover. The first clouds that indicate an approaching warm front tend to be mostly high cirrus at first, changing to cirrostratus as the front approaches. However, if cirrocumulus also appears, there is greater airmass instability approaching ahead of the front. When these high clouds progressively invade the sky and the barometric pressure begins to fall, precipitation associated with the disturbance is likely about 6 to 8 hours away. A thickening and lowering of these high clouds into middle-stage altostratus or altocumulus is a good sign the warm front or low has moved closer and precipitation may begin within less than six hours. Once the clouds have thickened to from the earth’s surface, precipitation can begin to fall from heavy nimbostratus. If unstable altocumulus castellanus accompanies or takes the place of the main altostratus layer, cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus producing showers or thunderstorms may follow. Low stratus and stratocumulus commonly form underneath the main precipitating clouds.

A warm front is also defined as the transition zone where a warmer air mass is replacing a cooler air mass. Warm fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. If the warmer air originates over the ocean, it is not only warmer but also more moist than the air ahead of it.

==Characteristics==
If the air mass is relatively stable, rainfall will increase until the front reaches the location, at which time the clouds can extend all the way to the earth’s surface as fog. Once the front passes, the location experiences some warming and clearing. If the air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may precede and follow the front and temperature changes will be larger.

In the northern hemisphere, a warm front causes a shift of wind blowing from southeast to southwest, and in the southern hemisphere a shift from winds blowing from northeast to northwest. Common characteristics associated with warm fronts include:
==Warm sector==
The warm sector is a near-surface air mass in between the warm front and the cold front, on the equatorward side of an extratropical cyclone. With its warm and humid characteristics, this air is susceptive to convective instability and can sustain thunderstorms, especially if lifted by the advancing cold front.

==Depiction==

On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of the front. On colored weather maps, warm fronts are illustrated with a solid red line.

<doc id="693207" wikidata="Q876712" url="?curid=693207" title="Quasi-satellite">
<text>A quasi-satellite is an object in a specific type of co-orbital configuration (1:1 orbital resonance) with a planet (or dwarf planet) where the object stays close to that planet over many orbital periods.

A quasi-satellite&#x27;s orbit around the Sun takes the same time as the planet&#x27;s, but has a different eccentricity (usually greater), as shown in the diagram. When viewed from the perspective of the planet by an observer facing the Sun, the quasi-satellite will appear to travel in an oblong retrograde loop around the planet. .

In contrast to &quot;true&quot; satellites, quasi-satellite orbits lie outside the planet&#x27;s Hill sphere, and are unstable. Over time they tend to evolve to other types of resonant motion, where they no longer remain in the planet&#x27;s neighborhood, then possibly later move back to a quasi-satellite orbit, etc.

Other types of orbit in a 1:1 resonance with the planet include horseshoe orbits and tadpole orbits around the Lagrangian points, but objects in these orbits do not stay near the planet&#x27;s longitude over many revolutions about the star. Objects in horseshoe orbits are known to sometimes periodically transfer to a relatively short-lived quasi-satellite orbit, and are sometimes confused with them. An example of such an object is .

A quasi-satellite is similar to an object in a distant retrograde orbit, in a different context. The latter term is usually used for a space probe or artificial satellite in a retrograde orbit around a moon, and the period may be much shorter than that of the moon, whereas the term &quot;quasi-satellite&quot; usually refers to an object like an asteroid whose period is similar to that of the planet of which it is considered to be a quasi-satellite. But in both cases, the object (asteroid, space probe) viewed in a reference frame that rotates with the two main objects (once a year for Sun-Earth, once a month for Earth-Moon) appears to move retrograde compared to that rotation, thus lengthening its sidereal period. So a quasi-satellite (with low inclination) tends to stay in certain constellations rather than going through the whole zodiac. Quasi-satellites with high eccentricity can get quite far from their planet, more than an astronomical unit for quasi-satellites of Earth such as .

The word &quot;geosynchronous&quot; is sometimes used to describe quasi-satellites of the Earth, because their motion around the Sun is synchronized with Earth&#x27;s. However, this usage is unconventional and confusing. Conventionally, geosynchronous satellites revolve in the prograde sense around the Earth, with orbital periods that are synchronized to the Earth&#x27;s rotation.

==Examples==

===Venus===
Venus has one known quasi-satellite, 524522 Zoozve. This asteroid is also a Mercury- and Earth-crosser; it seems to have been a &quot;companion&quot; to Venus for approximately the last 7,000 years only, and is destined to be ejected from this orbital arrangement about 500 years from now.

===Earth===

As of 2023, Earth had seven known quasi-satellites:
* 164207 Cardea
* 
* 
* 

On the longer term, asteroids can transfer between quasi-satellite orbits and horseshoe orbits, which circulate around Lagrangian points L4 and L5. By 2016, orbital calculations showed that all five of Earth&#x27;s then known quasi-satellites repeatedly transfer between horseshoe and quasi-satellite orbits. 3753 Cruithne, , and are minor planets in horseshoe orbits that might evolve into a quasi-satellite orbit. The time spent in the quasi-satellite phase differs from asteroid to asteroid. Quasi-satellite is predicted to be stable in this orbital state for several hundred years, in contrast to which was a quasi-satellite from 1996 to 2006 but then departed Earth&#x27;s vicinity on a horseshoe orbit.

469219 Kamoʻoalewa () is thought to be one of the most stable quasi-satellites found yet of Earth. It stays between 38 and 100 lunar distances from the Earth.

===Ceres===
The dwarf-planet asteroid 1 Ceres is believed to have a quasi-satellite, the as-yet-unnamed .

===Neptune===
 is a temporary quasi-satellite of Neptune. The object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years.

===Other planets===
Based on simulations, it is believed that Uranus and Neptune could potentially hold quasi-satellites for up to the age of the Solar System (about 4.5 billion years), but a quasi-satellite&#x27;s orbit would remain stable for only 10 million years near Jupiter and 100,000 years near Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are known to have quasi-satellites. , a co-orbital to Jupiter, intermittently becomes a quasi satellite of the planet, and will next become one between 2380 and 2480.

===Artificial quasi-satellites===
In early 1989, the Soviet &quot;Phobos 2&quot; spacecraft was injected into a quasi-satellite orbit around the Martian moon Phobos, with a mean orbital radius of about from Phobos. According to computations, it could have then stayed trapped in the vicinity of Phobos for many months. The spacecraft was lost due to a malfunction of the on-board control system.

In 2005, aerospace engineer Thomas Gangale proposed a quasi-satellite orbit for spacecraft to provide communications relays between Earth and crews on Mars when Mars is in solar conjunction and direct communication is blocked by the Sun for several weeks.

===Accidental quasi-satellites===
Some objects are known to be accidental quasi-satellites, which means that they are not forced into the configuration by the gravitational influence of the body of which they are quasi-satellites. The dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto are known to have accidental quasi-satellites. In the case of Pluto, the known accidental quasi-satellite, 15810 Arawn, is, like Pluto, a plutino, and is forced into this configuration by the gravitational influence of Neptune. This dynamical behavior is recurrent where Arawn becomes a quasi-satellite of Pluto every 2.4 Myr and remains in that configuration for nearly 350,000 years.

<text>A stationary front (or quasi-stationary front) is a weather front or transition zone between two air masses when each air mass is advancing into the other at speeds less than 5 knots (about 6 miles per hour or about 9 kilometers per hour) at the ground surface. These fronts are typically depicted on weather maps as a solid line with alternating blue spikes (pointing toward the warmer air) and red domes (facing the colder air). 

==Development==
A stationary front may form when a cold or warm front slows down or grows over time from underlying surface temperature differences, like a coastal front. Winds on the cold air and warm air sides often flow nearly parallel to the stationary front, often in opposite directions along either side of the stationary front. A stationary front usually remains in the same area for hours to days and may undulate as atmospheric waves move eastward along the front.

Stationary fronts may also change into a cold or warm front and may form one or more extratropical or mid-latitude cyclone s at the surface when atmospheric waves aloft are fiercer, cold or warm air masses advance fast enough into other air masses at the surface.  For instance, when a cold air mass traverses sufficiently quick into a warm air mass, the stationary front changes into a cold front.

There are frequently variations in wind and air temperature on opposing sides of a stationary front because it delineates the boundary between two air masses. Along a stationary front, the weather is typically overcast with rain or snow, particularly if the front is in an area of low air pressure.

== Characteristics ==
A warm front is a slow-moving air mass that displaces a cold air mass. Warm fronts typically move at speeds of 10 to 25 miles per hour, and clouds form as warm air is lifted up, then cooled and condensed to form clouds. A warm front may bring persistent precipitation, fog, and cloudy skies, signaling the start of wet weather. Sleet can also form when a warm front meets an extremely cold air mass, cooling the air below. Sleet forms when a warm front meets an extremely cold air mass. On the other hand, cold fronts move faster than warm fronts, at speeds of 25 to 30 miles per hour (up to 60 miles per hour). Cold fronts can cause rapid changes in weather. When a cold front moves into an area, it brings with it a drop in temperatures, which can lead to thunderstorms. These can cause big changes in the weather.

Although the stationary front&#x27;s position may not move, there is air motion as warm air rises up and over the cold air, responsive to the geostrophic induced by frontogenesis. A wide variety of weather may occur along a stationary front. If one or both air masses are humid enough, cloudy skies and prolonged precipitation are recurring, with storm trains or mesocyclone systems. When the warmer air mass is very moist, heavy or extreme rain or snow can occur.

Stationary fronts may dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines. A stationary front becomes a shear line when air density contrast across the front vanishes, usually because of temperature equalization, while the narrow wind shift zone persists for some time. That is most common over open oceans, where the ocean surface temperature is similar on both sides of the front and modifies both air masses to correspond to its temperature. That sometimes also provides enough heat energy and moisture to form subtropical storms and tropical cyclones at the surface.

<doc id="693210" wikidata="Q747330" url="?curid=693210" title="Occluded front">
<text>In meteorology, an occluded front is a type of weather front formed during cyclogenesis. The classical and usual view of an occluded front is that it starts when a cold front overtakes a warm front near a cyclone, such that the warm air is separated (occluded) from the cyclone center at the surface. The point where the warm front becomes the occluded front is the &quot;triple point&quot;; a new area of low-pressure that develops at this point is called a &quot;triple-point low&quot;. A more modern view of the formation process suggests that occluded fronts form directly without the influence of other fronts during the wrap-up of the baroclinic zone during cyclogenesis, and then lengthen due to flow deformation and rotation around the cyclone as the cyclone forms.

== Features and variants ==

Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas. There are two types of front occlusions, warm and cold, depending on the temperature contrast: 

* In a cold occlusion, the cold air mass that overtakes the warm air mass ahead is colder than the cool air at the very front and plows under both air masses, and often has the characteristics of a cold front.
* In a warm occlusion, the cool air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm air mass and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air, and often has the characteristics of a warm front.
The occluded front symbol should show where the cold air intersects the surface. It thus varies between warm and cold occlusions. The TROWAL (short for TROugh of Warm air ALoft), is the estimated projection of the wedge of warm air above the surface, and is at the same position in both cases. Consequently, the location of the occluded front appearing in the surface weather analysis is often offset from the range of the associated weather which occurs at the TROWAL. The TROWAL, is primarily found with a connection to the warm occlusion, and are rarely seen in cold occlusion. 

== Related weather ==
One symbol of an occluded front is the TROWAL symbol with alternating blue and red lines similar to a cold/warm front junction

A cold front is diagrammed as spikes pointing to its direction of travel. A warm front is shown as semi-circles in a traditional weather map, also pointing to its direction of travel. An occluded front is a combination of those two signs: they are indicated on a weather map either by a purple line with alternating semicircles and triangles pointing to the direction of travel, or by red semicircles and blue triangles pointing to the direction of travel. On the other hand, a TROWAL is diagrammed on weather maps by the junction of blue and red lines like the junction of cold and warm fronts aloft.

A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes possible, but usually, their passage is instead associated with a drying of the air mass. Additionally, cold core funnel clouds are possible if the wind shear is significant along the cold front. Small isolated occluded fronts often remain for a period after a low-pressure system has decayed and disappeared and these create cloudy conditions with patchy areas of rain or showers.

However, the clouds and precipitation are not really the location where the projection on the Earth&#x27;s surface of the occluded front is, but it is with the TROWAL position.

<doc id="693213" wikidata="Q2742789" url="?curid=693213" title="Dry line">
<text>A dry line (also called a dew point line, or Marfa front, after Marfa, Texas) is a line across a continent that separates moist air and dry air. One of the most prominent examples of such a separation occurs in central North America, especially Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, where the moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets dry air from the desert south-western states. The dry line is an important factor in severe weather frequency in the Great Plains of North America. It typically lies north-south across the High Plains states in the warm sector of an extratropical cyclone and stretches into the Canadian Prairies during the spring and early summer. The dry line is also important for severe convective storms in other regions of the world, such as northern India and Southern Africa. In general, thunderstorms and other forms of severe weather occur on the moist side of the dryline.

==Characteristics==

Near the surface, warm dry air is denser than warm moist air of lesser or similar temperature, and thus the warm dry air wedges under the moist air like a cold front.
At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the cooler, drier air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. The dry line is most common in the spring. Its location is close to the location of the isodrosotherm, or line of equal dewpoint. The location of the dryline may not be marked with a surface pressure trough or shift of the wind direction. It bulges more to the east underneath the location of the highest winds within the jet stream. While dry lines are most common in the Great Plains, northern India also witnesses a similar moisture boundary. In northeast India, it occurs mainly before the onset of their summer monsoon, while northwest India experiences it during the monsoon season.

===Dry punch===
A dry punch is meteorological slang for a synoptic scale or mesoscale process. A dry punch at the surface results in a dry line bulge. A dry punch aloft above an area of warm, moist (buoyant) air at low levels often increases the potential for severe thunderstorms.

==Daily progression in North America==
The dry line typically advances eastward during the afternoon and retreats westward at night, mainly due to the increased mixing down to the surface of moist air aloft, rather than the air mass&#x27; surface density contrast. The movement of the dry line during daylight hours is quickest in areas where low level moisture is most shallow, as dryline movement slows in areas with deeper low-level moisture. Weaker winds aloft also slow its progression. However, a strong storm system can sweep the dry line eastward into the Mississippi Valley or Texas/Louisiana border, regardless of the time of day. Stronger dry line passages result in a sharp drop in dew point, clearing skies, and a wind shift from south or south-easterly to west or south-westerly. Blowing dust and rising temperatures also may follow, especially if the dry line passes during the daytime. These changes occur in reverse order when the dry line retreats westward during the evening and nighttime hours. Severe and sometimes tornadic thunderstorms often develop along the slope-reversal zone east of the surface dry line, especially when it begins moving eastward.

==Associated weather==
In the dry sector west of the dry line, clear skies are the rule due to the dryness of the air mass sweeping in from the Desert Southwest in North America, and the Aravalli range in India. If winds are strong enough, dust storms can develop. Cumulus clouds are common east of the dry line in the moist sector, though they are taller with greater development along the dry line itself. The moist sector is normally capped with a lid of an elevated mixed drier layer which represents subsidence from aloft as the surface air cools and contracts at night. The same process promotes the development of a low level jet to the east of the dryline. During the daytime, if heating and/or convergence are sufficient, the cap can be broken, resulting in convective clouds.

<text>Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome and Proving Ground is a privately owned former airport near the village of Bruntingthorpe, Leicestershire to the south of Leicester. It was opened as RAF Bruntingthorpe in 1942.

==History==

The aerodrome was originally RAF Bruntingthorpe and hosted both the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force during its life. In 1973 it was sold to Chrysler Motor Corporation, which used it as a vehicle proving ground. In August 1983 it was purchased by C Walton Ltd and it continued in use as a vehicle proving ground and also provided facilities for historic aircraft storage and maintenance, air shows, corporate hospitality, exhibition space, location filming, motorcycle design and development, and vehicle storage and auctions. In 2020 it was sold to Cox Automotive for vehicle storage and auctions, with a part retained by the Walton family for aircraft activities.

==Current uses==
Vehicles

The site can accommodate about 25,000 vehicles, parked on the former runway and taxi areas.

One Cold War-era hangar formerly housed the Manheim Bruntingthorpe Car Auction Centre.

Royal Enfield Motorcycles have established their Worldwide Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe.

Aircraft

The most notable aircraft at the aerodrome was the Avro Vulcan XH558, which was restored to airworthy condition over eight years at a cost of about GBP 6,000,000. Its first flight was from Bruntingthorpe on 18 October 2007. The Vulcan left Bruntingthorpe at the beginning of the 2008 flying display season, was temporarily based at RAF Brize Norton as a flying base, and RAF Lyneham as its winter maintenance base. It is now grounded and based at Doncaster Sheffield Airport, Doncaster, formerly RAF Finningley &#x27;V Bomber&#x27; base, but will be dismantled and moved in 2023 as the airport has closed.

Bruntingthorpe houses the Cold War Jets Collection aircraft museum on the edge of the site, although due a reduction in space some aircraft have now been moved to other locations such as the South Wales Aviation Museum.

Vickers VC10 C1K XR808 &quot;Bob&quot; arrived at Bruntingthorpe on 29 July 2013 after retirement from the RAF and has now moved to RAF Cosford to join their museum.

In March 2013, six of the former nine RAF Lockheed TriStars were flown to the aerodrome to be stored, but have since been scrapped.

The last VC-10 to fly (ZA147) was flown to the aerodrome to be stored, but has since been scrapped.

==1997 Boeing 747 explosion test==
In 1997, the airfield was used by the Federal Aviation Administration of the US and the Civil Aviation Authority to conduct a test to study the effects of a terrorist planted bomb explosion on board a wide-body aircraft such as had happened over Lockerbie. The test used an ex-Air France Boeing 747-100, and four similar sized bombs were detonated at the same time, two in each underfloor luggage compartment, in opposite corners. Three of the four corners where the explosions were to take place were thoroughly protected by kevlar or titanium, but the rear left hand corner of the rear luggage compartment was deliberately left unprotected, to see what the effect would be. Many cameras were positioned inside the aircraft and round it outside, and there is a well known photograph of the rear port side of the aircraft being blown out. There was no damage elsewhere, the protective measures having completely contained the other three explosions.

Photographs of the test were later involved in a hoax, which supposedly showed an Air Canada Boeing 747 with its back half exploding on landing. The photo was, however, an edit of an Air Canada Boeing 747 landing normally with the photo of the explosion test stitched onto the back of the aircraft.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 3 May 2009, during a &quot;fast taxi&quot; run, Handley Page Victor XM715 made an unplanned brief flight, reaching a height of between 20 and 30 ft before being landed. The aircraft does not have a permit to fly. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stated that they would not be conducting an investigation. The causes have been identified as the co-pilot failing to reply to the command &#x27;throttles back&#x27;, thus resulting in the pilot having to control the throttles himself, resulting in a brief loss of control of the aircraft, causing it to rise. No legal action was to be taken by the CAA against either of the crew aboard XM715 or the operators of Bruntingthorpe Airfield.

<text>The chestnut munia or black-headed munia (Lonchura atricapilla) is a small passerine. It was formerly considered conspecific with the closely related tricoloured munia, but is now widely recognized as a separate species. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and Hawaii. It also has been introduced to all the Greater Antilles and Martinique in the Caribbean.

Before 1995, it was the national bird of the Philippines, 
where it is known as &quot;mayang pula&quot; (&quot;red maya&quot;) because of its brick red patch on the lower back which is visible only when it flies. (This distinguishes it from other birds locally called &quot;maya&quot;, notably the predominantly brownish &quot;mayang simbahan&quot; (tree sparrow) which is more common in urban areas.)

==Subspecies==
The chestnut munia has several subspecies that are recognized, including:
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla atricapilla&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla rubroniger&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla sinensis&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla formosana&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla deignani&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla brunneiceps&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla jagori&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla selimbauensis&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla obscura&quot;
* &quot;Lonchura atricapilla batakana&quot;

== Description ==

Small, sexes alike, races differ slightly in intensity of color. in &quot;jagori&quot; Ad whole head, breast center of belly, and undertail coverts black; back, wing, and sides of belly chestnut, brighter on underparts, duller on wings; uppertail coverts dark reddish brown, underpart buff; uppertail coverts and tail as ad. Bill silvery gray; eye chestnut; legs gray.

==Habitat==
The chestnut munia is a small gregarious bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open grassland and cultivation. The nest is a large domed grass structure in a bush or tall grass into which 4–7 white eggs are laid.

==Characteristics==
The chestnut munia is 11–12 cm in length. The adult has a stubby pale grey-blue bill, black head, and brown body, with a brick red patch on the lower back, visible only when it flies. Some races also have a black belly.

The sexes are similar, but immature birds have uniform pale brown upperparts, lack the dark head and have white to pale buff underparts.

== National bird of the Philippines until 1995 ==
The black-headed munia was the national bird of the Philippines until 1995, when that honorific was transferred to the Philippine eagle. There, due to urbanization and the resulting lack of awareness of local species, it is nowadays often confused for the Eurasian tree sparrow because that species, one of several also categorized as &quot;maya&quot; in the Philippines, is much more common in the urban areas.

<text>Murray McElwain Roy Baron (born June 1, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers, St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Phoenix Coyotes, and Vancouver Canucks.

==Playing career==

===Philadelphia Flyers===
Baron was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the eighth round, 167th overall, of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He then attended the University of North Dakota for three years. Baron got his feet wet in the NHL playing 16 games with the Flyers in 1989–90 before playing 67 games the following year and establishing himself as an every-day NHLer. Shortly before the start of the 1991–92 season Baron was part of a deal that saw him and long-time Flyer Ron Sutter traded to the St. Louis Blues for Rod Brind&#x27;Amour and Dan Quinn.

===St. Louis Blues===
For the next five seasons in St. Louis Baron built a reputation as a bruising physical defensemen. Early on in the 1996–97 season, Baron was part of a blockbuster trade that sent him and Shayne Corson, along with a 5th-round draft pick to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Pierre Turgeon, Craig Conroy and Rory Fitzpatrick.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Baron&#x27;s time with the Canadiens proved to be short-lived and after just 60-games he was on the move again, this time off to the Phoenix Coyotes in a deal for fellow defensemen Dave Manson.

===Phoenix Coyotes===
Baron would play just 63-games with the Coyotes over the next two seasons before he was changing addresses again, signing on with the Vancouver Canucks as a free agent.

===Vancouver Canucks===
In Vancouver, Baron finally found some stability setting in on the Canucks blue line and spending the next five seasons with the team and serving as their alternate captain. Following the 2002–03 season Baron left Vancouver as a free agent.

===Return to St. Louis===
With time running out in his career, the 37-year old blue liner signed a one-year deal to return to the St. Louis Blues. Baron scored one goal and added five assists in 80 games and retired from the NHL following the season.

== Coaching career ==
In 2011, Baron began his coaching career as an assistant coach with the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League&#x27;s Kamloops Storm. He also coaches for Kamloops Minor Hockey.

<text>Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet KCH FRS (20 May 1772 – 16 May 1828) was a British Army officer, Tory politician, publisher and inventor. A pioneer in the field of rocket artillery, he was renowned for his development and use of Congreve rockets during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Rebeca Elmston and Lt. General Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet, the Comptroller of the Royal Laboratories at the Royal Arsenal and raised in Kent, England. He was educated at Newcome&#x27;s school in Hackney, Wolverhampton Grammar School and Singlewell School in Kent. He then studied law at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1793 and MA in 1796. In 1814 he succeeded his father as second Baronet Congreve.

In 1803, he was a volunteer in the London and Westminster Light Horse, and was a London businessman who published a polemical newspaper, the &quot;Royal Standard and Political Register&quot;, which was Tory, pro-government and anti-Cobbett. Following a damaging libel action against it in 1804, Congreve withdrew from publishing and applied himself to inventing. Many years previously, several unsuccessful experiments had been made at the Royal Laboratory in Woolwich by Lt. General Thomas Desaguliers. In 1804, at his own expense, he began experimenting with rockets at Woolwich. Congreve was named as comptroller of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich from 1814 until his death. (Congreve&#x27;s father had also held the same post.)

Congreve was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Hanoverian army&#x27;s artillery in 1811, and was often referred to as &quot;Colonel Congreve&quot;, later made major general in the same army. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March that year. He was also awarded the Order of St. George following the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and 1816 he was made Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH). In 1821 he was awarded the Order of the Sword by the King of Sweden.

He enjoyed the friendship of the Prince Regent, in whose household he served as an equerry from 1811, carrying on the service when the Prince, who supported his rocket projects, became King George IV in 1820.

Earlier in 1812 he offered to contest for Parliament the borough of Liverpool but withdrew before polling for lack of support. He entered Parliament later that year when he was nominated as MP for the rotten borough of Gatton in 1812, but withdrew at the next elections in 1814 in favour of the son of the borough&#x27;s proprietor Sir Mark Wood. In 1818 he was returned as Member for Plymouth, a seat he held until his death.

After living with a mistress and fathering two illegitimate sons, he married in December 1824, at Wessel, Prussia, Isabella Carvalho (or Charlotte), a young woman of Portuguese descent and widow of Henry Nisbett McEvoy. They had two sons and a daughter.

In 1824, he became general manager of the English Association for Gas Lighting on the Continent, a sizeable business producing gas for several cities in mainland Europe, including Berlin.

In later years, he became a businessman and was chairman of the Equitable Loan Bank, director of the Arigna Iron and Coal Company, the Palladium Insurance Company and the Peruvian Mining Company. After a major fraud case began against him in 1826 in connection with the Arigna company, he fled to France, where he was taken seriously ill. He was prosecuted in his absence, the Lord Chancellor ultimately ruling, just before Congreve&#x27;s death, that the transaction was &quot;clearly fraudulent&quot; and designed to profit Congreve and others.

He died in Toulouse, France, in May 1828, aged 55, and was buried there in the Protestant and Jewish cemetery of Chemin du Béarnais.
Congreve&#x27;s name was used for a kind of friction match, &quot;Congreaves&quot;, though he was not involved in their invention or production.

==Congreve Rockets==

Mysorean rockets were the first iron-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. Hyder Ali, the 18th century ruler of Mysore and his son and successor Tipu Sultan used them against the forces of the East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, beginning in 1780 with the Battle of Pollilur. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with minimal effect against the British.

The experiences of the British with Mysorean rockets, mentioned in Munro&#x27;s book of 1789, eventually led to the Royal Arsenal beginning a military rocket R&amp;D program in 1801. Several rocket cases were collected from Mysore and sent to Britain for analysis. The development was chiefly the work of William Congreve, who set up a research and development programme at the Woolwich Arsenal&#x27;s laboratory. After development work was complete the rockets were manufactured in quantity further north, near Waltham Abbey, Essex. He was told that &quot;the British at Seringapatam had suffered more from the rockets than from the shells or any other weapon used by the enemy.&quot; &quot;In at least one instance&quot;, an eyewitness told Congreve, &quot;a single rocket had killed three men and badly wounded others.&quot;

It has been suggested that Congreve may have adapted iron-cased gunpowder rockets for use by the British military from prototypes created by the Irish nationalist Robert Emmet during Emmet&#x27;s Rebellion in 1803. But this seems far less likely given the fact that the British had been exposed to Indian rockets since 1780 at the latest, and that a vast quantity of unused rockets and their construction equipment fell into British hands at the end of the Anglo-Mysore Wars in 1799, 4 years before Emmet&#x27;s rockets.

Congreve first demonstrated solid fuel rockets at the Royal Arsenal in 1805. He considered his work sufficiently advanced to engage in two Royal Navy attacks on the French fleet at Boulogne, France, one that year and one the next. In 1807 Congreve and sixteen Ordnance Department civilian employees were present at the Bombardment of Copenhagen, during which 300 rockets contributed to the conflagration of the city.

Congreve rockets were successfully used for the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars, with the most important employment of the weapon being at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The &quot;rockets&#x27; red glare&quot; in the American national anthem describes their firing at Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. In January 1814 the Royal Artillery absorbed the various companies armed with rockets into two Rocket Troops within the Royal Horse Artillery. They remained in the arsenal of the United Kingdom until the 1850s. Congreve organized the impressive firework displays in London for the peace of 1814 and for the coronation of George IV in 1821.

==Other inventions==
Besides his rockets, Congreve was a prolific (if indifferently successful) inventor for the remainder of his life. He registered 18 patents, of which 2 were for rockets. Congreve invented a gun-recoil mounting, a time-fuze, a rocket parachute attachment, a hydropneumatic canal lock (installed at Hampstead Road Lock, north London) and sluice (1813), a perpetual motion machine, a process of colour printing (1821) which was widely used in Germany, a new form of steam engine, and a method of consuming smoke (which was applied at the Royal Laboratory). He also took out patents for a clock in which time was measured by a ball rolling along a zig-zag track on an inclined plane; for protecting buildings against fire; inlaying and combining metals; unforgeable bank note paper; a method of killing whales by means of rockets; improvements in the manufacture of gunpowder; stereotype plates; fireworks; and gas meters.

Congreve&#x27;s unsuccessful perpetual motion scheme involved an endless band which should raise more water by its capillary action on one side than on the other. He used capillary action of fluids that would disobey the law of never rising above their own level, so to produce a continual ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed, and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. The capillary action raised the water, whereas the same thing could not happen in the part, since the weights would squeeze the water out. Hence, it was heavier than the other; but as &quot;we know that if it were the same weight, there would be equilibrium, if the heavy chain be also uniform&quot;. Therefore, the extra weight of it would cause the chain to move round in the direction of the arrow, and this would go on, supposedly, continually.

<text>Affine logic is a substructural logic whose proof theory rejects the structural rule of contraction. It can also be characterized as linear logic with weakening. 

The name &quot;affine logic&quot; is associated with linear logic, to which it differs by allowing the weakening rule. Jean-Yves Girard introduced the name as part of the geometry of interaction semantics of linear logic, which characterizes linear logic in terms of linear algebra; here he alludes to affine transformations on vector spaces.

Affine logic predated linear logic. V. N. Grishin used this logic in 1974, after observing that Russell&#x27;s paradox cannot be derived in a set theory without contraction, even with an unbounded comprehension axiom. Likewise, the logic formed the basis of a decidable sub-theory of predicate logic, called &#x27;Direct logic&#x27; (Ketonen &amp; Wehrauch, 1984; Ketonen &amp; Bellin, 1989).

Affine logic can be embedded into linear logic by rewriting the affine arrow formula_1 as the linear arrowformula_2.

Whereas full linear logic (i.e. propositional linear logic with multiplicatives, additives, and exponentials) is undecidable, full affine logic is decidable.

Affine logic forms the foundation of ludics.

<text>The North Sydney Bears are an Australian rugby league football club based on Sydney&#x27;s North Shore. The club competes in the NSW Cup, having exited the National Rugby League following the 1999 NRL season after 90 years in the premier rugby league competition in Australia. There have been on-going bids to resurrect the club in the NRL as either &quot;The Bears&quot;, based in Perth and Sydney, or as the Central Coast Bears, based at Gosford. However, as of January 2025, the bid to be based in Perth is the Favourite. However, the bid is a partnership and not officially considered a relocation. The North Sydney Bears are expected to keep their headquarters in Cammeray, or at least on Sydney’s North Shore
The club was established in 1908, making it one of the original founding members of the New South Wales Rugby Football League, and one of Australia&#x27;s first rugby league football clubs. They continued competing with some success in the first half of the 20th century in the NSWRL, and through the ARL and NRL premierships until the club created a joint venture with Manly Warringah Sea Eagles to form the Northern Eagles for the 2000 season. The partnership only lasted until 2001, when the licence reverted to the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, although 2002 was played under the Northern Eagles name, with the Bears not returning to first grade and being represented in the NSWRL competition, the second-tier rugby league competition, where they continue to play today. The North Sydney club also field teams in the Harold Matthews Cup and SG Ball competitions.

North Sydney had a partnership with South Sydney serving as Souths&#x27; reserve grade side from 2007 until the agreement ended in 2018. In total, 247 players who had been affiliated with Souths played with North Sydney in the Intrust Super Premiership NSW. Until the end of season 2009, Souths were coached by the Bears&#x27; record-breaking top points scorer, Jason Taylor. In September 2018, North Sydney announced that it had signed a five-year deal to become the Sydney Roosters feeder club and reserve grade side with Taylor returning to the club as head coach.
On the 17 May 2023, it was announced that North Sydney had signed a two-year partnership with NRL club Melbourne starting in 2024.

==History==
North Sydney was formed as a foundation club of the newly arrived rugby league game in 1908 and were initially known as the Shoremen. The club was formed at the North Sydney School of Arts in Mount Street on 7 February 1908. Like the other Sydney district clubs, Norths were largely born from players and officials from the local Rugby Union club, Northern Suburbs Rugby Club. The club initially struggled to obtain access to North Sydney Oval, but council obstruction was removed and the Shoremen played their first real home game in 1910. Many good players such as Andy Morton, Jimmy Devereaux and Sid Deane were lost to English clubs in the years after making the semi-finals in the season of 1908. 

They were nearly dropped from the competition during World War I due to dwindling spectator numbers. Towards the end of the war Norths&#x27; fortunes improved, playing quality and spectators numbers increased, and they won 2 premierships in 1921–22 coached by Chris McKivat. Unfortunately, these would be their last first grade premierships, and their last grand final appearance was in 1943. when an injury riddled North Sydney were beaten by Newtown 34–7. North Sydney&#x27;s Captain-coach in the Grand Final of 1943 was the future doyen of rugby league broadcasters, Frank Hyde. Hyde, who was living in Lane Cove at the time, had been forced to switch from Balmain to Norths in 1941 due to the league&#x27;s residency rules which stated that a player was required to live in their club&#x27;s district. As Lane Cove was in North Sydney&#x27;s district, the club protested to the NSWRFL and claimed Hyde from Balmain.

The team became known as the North Sydney Bears in 1959 after accepting a sponsorship from the nearby Big Bear supermarket at Neutral Bay.

The 1952 season saw North Sydney reach the finals for the first time since 1943. Norths went on to make the finals again in 1953 and 1954, losing to Souths and St. George respectively. Norths then had to wait 10 years to make the finals again, this time against Balmain where they lost 11–9. The following year North Sydney came 2nd in the regular season, but were defeated 47–7 by St George, and then lost to South Sydney 14-9 the following week.

During that time, North Sydney produced arguably the greatest winger the game has ever seen in Ken Irvine. Irvine held the record for most first grade tries for one club (171) and overall (212). New South Wales representative Queenslander, Bruce Walker, captained the Bears in the final of the 1976 Amco Cup.

It would be 17 years before North Sydney made the finals series again when they finished 3rd in the 1982 season. North Sydney were coached that year by the great Ron Willey. Norths were knocked out of the finals series that year in consecutive games, first losing to Manly and then to Eastern Suburbs. In 1986 North Sydney missed the finals. They were eliminated by Balmain in a playoff for 5th place.

The nineties saw finals appearances and near misses in 1991 and 1994–1998. In that time Norths made the preliminary final 4 times but lost on each occasion. In 1991 North Sydney finished the regular season in 3rd place and defeated local rivals Manly in the first week of the finals. In the next match North Sydney had the chance to make their first grand final in 48 years if they could defeat Penrith in the semi-final. After being behind on the scoreboard 12–0, Norths fought their way back into the match to level the scores at 14–14. Normally a reliable goal kicker, Daryl Halligan missed 4 shots at goal and kicked only 1 from 5 including a penalty miss in the dying minutes. Penrith won the match 16–14 despite the fact that Norths scored more tries. North Sydney would have another chance the following week to make the grand final going up against defending premiers Canberra in the preliminary final. North Sydney went down 14–30 giving Penrith a rematch of the 1990 grand final against Canberra.

On 14 July 1994, the club was fined $87,000 for breaching the salary cap. That year they came within one match of the grand final but lost to Canberra.

North Sydney remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war of the mid-1990s. In the 1996 ARL season Norths came within one match of the Grand Final but lost the game to the St George Dragons 29-12.

The following year saw two separate national rugby league championships, and confirmation of the club&#x27;s intention to move north to New South Wales&#x27; Central Coast.

In the 1997 season North Sydney again made the preliminary final against Newcastle at the Sydney Football Stadium. The winner of the match was to play minor premiers Manly in The Grand final. With the score 12–8 in favour of Newcastle with less than 10 minutes to play Jason Taylor set up Michael Buettner for a try which made the score 12–12. Normally a very reliable kicker and one of the most accurate in the competition, Taylor had already missed two previous conversions in the match but if he was to kick this goal it could send North Sydney through to their first grade final since 1943. Taylor ended up missing the goal. With the scores locked at 12–12, Newcastle player Matthew Johns kicked a field goal with 2 minutes to play to make it 13–12. With only seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around and lost it, the ball was swooped up by Newcastle&#x27;s Owen Craigie and he raced away to score a try and won the game.

In 1998, Norths finished 5th on the table and qualified for the finals. Once again they were eliminated from the finals after losing both their matches in consecutive weeks, 25–12 against Parramatta and 23–2 the following week against Canterbury.

By the start of the 1999 NRL season the future looked bright with plans for the move north well underway, but one unfortunate and apparently non-negotiable outcome of the Super League war&#x27;s peace deal was a criterion designed to reduce the number of teams in the NRL to fourteen.
With the NRL deeming North Sydney Oval unfit for first grade rugby league at the end of 1998, North Sydney spent the majority of the 1999 NRL season on the road playing home matches at Parramatta Stadium, Stadium Australia and Lang Park whilst they awaited their new stadium on the Central Coast to be constructed but heavy rainfall delayed the ground being built. North Sydney were allowed to return to North Sydney Oval midway through the season where they played Balmain winning 64–12. North Sydney played their final game in the top grade at the oval in round 25 against Melbourne with Norths winning 24–20. On 28 August 1999, Norths played their final game as a first grade side against the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville. Norths won the game 28–18.

===Northern Eagles===

Due to having a debt of around $4 million largely because the Central Coast Stadium not being constructed in time, the North Sydney club was not considered under the NRL&#x27;s inclusion criteria.

The joint venture club played out of Brookvale Oval and Central Coast Stadium at Gosford, a ground successfully lobbied and built for the Bears. However, poor on-field performances and factional fighting led to the collapse of the Northern Eagles in 2002, after only three years. After this, the Northern Eagles&#x27; licence then reverted to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, leaving the foundation club out of the top flight of rugby league in Australia after more than 90 years.

===New South Wales Cup===
North Sydney continue to play in the second-tier NSW Cup competition, initially serving as the reserve side for the Sydney Roosters. They have also been affiliated with the New Zealand Warriors, the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Melbourne Storm in the past, and are once again serving as a feeder club for the Melbourne Storm.

In the 2007 NSWRL Premier League the North Sydney club made the Grand Final facing off against Parramatta. They were beaten 20-15 by Weller Hauraki, scoring a controversial try with just 13 seconds to go, which many believed should not have been allowed due to a forward pass. North Sydney finished the 2008 season as NSW Cup minor premiers and were eliminated in the finals in straight sets.

In 2009, North Sydney lost to Balmain Tigers in extra time to miss out on the Grand Final 19–18. 2010 was a poor season for Norths, who received the wooden spoon. However this was turned around in the 2011 season with the North Sydney side reaching the preliminary final and losing to eventual premiers the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Deon Apps and Curtis Johnston represented the Bears in the 2011 NSW Residents side with Johnston finishing up leading try scorer for the competition by the end of the regular season with 28 tries, Johnston would play 110 games with the North Sydney NSW Cup scoring 97 tries in 6 seasons.

2012 saw North Sydney make the semi-finals, missing out on the minor premiership by points differential to Canterbury-Bankstown. They lost their first semi final to Newcastle Knights but had a chance to remain in the running of the competition the week after only to give up a 24–6 lead to the Newtown Jets and lose in extra time 32-30 from a Daniel Mortimer 35-metre penalty goal.

Newtown went on to beat Balmain in the 2012 NSW Cup Grand Final. In 2013, the Bears recorded several large victories in the regular season and finished third. They defeated the Newcastle Knights 32–28 in the first week of the finals, and were then eliminated by minor premiers and eventual NSW Cup premiers the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the preliminary final, who recorded a convincing 38-6 win. This was the third consecutive season that the North Sydney side had been eliminated in the finals by the team which would eventually win the premiership. This was also Matt King&#x27;s final game of Rugby League.

After three consecutive top four finishes, season 2014 was a horror year for North Sydney, who recorded only two wins throughout the entire season and finished with the wooden spoon, eight points below the second-last placed Manly Warringah. Season 2015 saw a strong improvement as Norths won nine games throughout the season and returned to the NSW Cup finals, only to be eliminated by Canterbury in Week One, and finished eighth.

In the 2016 NSW Cup North Sydney finished the season in 10th place and therefore missed the finals.

In the 2017 season, Norths finished 6th on the ladder and qualified for the finals. On 3 September 2017, Norths played against Newcastle in the first elimination match and were defeated 40–18 ending their season. On 19 September, it was announced that Ben Gardiner was leaving as coach of the club after two and a half years in charge.

On 11 October 2017, Shane Millard was announced as new head coach by the club. On 20 May 2018, it was revealed that North Sydney were in advanced negotiations to sign former NRL player Todd Carney. South Sydney who had a partnership with Norths at the time were not happy with this decision and declared that there would be no NRL pathway for Carney, and also declared that they might withdraw their relationship with Norths as a result. North Sydney chairman Perry Lopez said of the deal &quot;We are the North Sydney Bears, we&#x27;re not South Sydney,&quot; The decision is based on what&#x27;s best for our club. At the end of the day, if they don&#x27;t like the decision the Bears make, they can take it up with us. &quot;If Souths don’t agree with what we&#x27;re doing and decide it&#x27;s not in our interest, we will look at the other avenues we have to ensure we have a competitive ISP side. At the end of the day, we are the North Sydney Bears and we&#x27;ll look to not just have a competitive side but a winning side. This decision comes on the back of that. Our club is a 1908 foundation club,&quot;. &quot;We are here to win games and show our fans a product they can be proud of. We are super excited to have a player of Todd Carney&#x27;s calibre join the mighty North Sydney Bears&quot;.

On 21 May 2018, Carney officially signed with North Sydney, in reaction to the signing, General Manager of football at Souths Shane Richardson said &quot;We&#x27;ve spoken to Norths about Todd Carney and it&#x27;s our position that we will develop our young halves, as opposed to bringing in a player from outside the club in this instance,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;&#x27;The &#x27;Rabbitoh Way&#x27; is to build a culture that rewards young players for hard work, a culture that has respect for the club and its people, respects the members and sponsors that invest financially and emotionally into what we are doing here at South Sydney, and a culture of developing young players that want to play for South Sydney and that we see having a future NRL career&quot;. On 1 July 2018, Carney&#x27;s move to North Sydney was blocked after Carney refused to pay a $15,000 release fee. The Northern Pride who Carney was contracted with demanded that Norths pay the fee which the club refused to do and hoped that a deal could be met between Carney&#x27;s management team and The Queensland Cup side before the 30 June transfer window closed. Carney spoke to the media saying &quot;I had that option with the Bears but Souths have blocked that, I&#x27;m sure something will come up&quot;. Carney&#x27;s blocked move coincided with the departure of Souths contracted player Robbie Farah who spent the first 12 weeks playing for North Sydney.

On 25 August 2018, Norths lost their last game of the season against the New Zealand Warriors due to a last minute try scored by Chanel Harris-Tavita. Norths came into the game with an outside chance of making the finals but the loss ensured Norths finished outside the top 8 and with a bad point points differential meant they finished in second last place on the table.

On 5 September 2018, North Sydney announced that they were ending their agreement with the South Sydney Rabbitohs to act as their reserve grade side and had signed a 5 year deal to join the Sydney Roosters as their new feeder club team for the 2019 season. Former North Sydney player and the club&#x27;s leading record point scorer Jason Taylor was named as new head coach. At the end of the 2019 Canterbury Cup NSW regular season, Norths finished third on the table and qualified for the finals.

North Sydney would go on to lose both finals matches against South Sydney and Newtown. In the elimination final against Newtown, Norths lost 30-28 even though they scored more tries than the opposition. Norths player Drew Hutchison also had a bad match kicking two goals from six attempts including one from right in front to send the game into extra-time.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canterbury Cup NSW, Ron Massey Cup and Sydney Shield competitions were cancelled. North Sydney chose to join the temporary Presidents Cup competition which involved teams from country New South Wales and the Ron Massey Cup. North Sydney would eventually reach the preliminary final in the competition but were defeated by Glebe 26-6.
In the 2022 NSW Cup season, North Sydney finished third on the table and qualified for the finals. North Sydney would be eliminated from the finals in straight sets losing to Penrith and Canterbury. On 8 November 2022, the Sydney Roosters announced that they would be ending their partnership deal with North Sydney at the end of the 2023 season. The Sydney Roosters revealed that they would be fielding their own team in the NSW Cup for 2023 but would still provide some contracted players to North Sydney as part of the agreement.
On 17 May 2023, North Sydney announced that they had agreed a two-year partnership with NRL club Melbourne starting in 2024. Throughout the two-year deal, Melbourne players will now be divided between three feeder clubs — the North Sydney side in the New South Wales Cup, as well as Queensland Cup sides Sunshine Coast Falcons and Brisbane Easts.
In the 2023 NSW Cup, North Sydney claimed their first minor premiership since 2008 with two games to spare in the regular season.
North Sydney would reach the 2023 NSW Cup grand final against South Sydney who they had lost against in the first week of the finals. In the grand final, North Sydney lead the match with only five minutes remaining before South Sydney scored a try to win 22-18.
In November 2023, Jason Taylor left his position as North Sydney head coach to take up a role as Canterbury&#x27;s new assistant head coach. The club then announced Pat Weisner as his replacement.
In the 2024 NSW Cup season, North Sydney claimed their second consecutive minor premiership.
Norths would eventually reach their second consecutive NSW Cup grand final and were favourites going into the game against fellow foundation club Newtown. However, North Sydney would lose the final 28-22.

The Bears have won eight premierships in reserve grade, making them the fifth most successful club currently participating in the competition. They last won a premiership in 1993, defeating Newcastle in the grand final 5–4. The Bears have also been the only team to have participated in every season of reserve grade since the competition&#x27;s inception in 1908.

===Central Coast Bears===

There was a movement for a return to first-grade Rugby League for the club, with the North Sydney Bears moving to Gosford (on the Central Coast, New South Wales) and becoming the Central Coast Bears. The Bears bid committee lobbied the NRL for inclusion as the next expansion team. They were headed up by Perry Lopez and Greg Florimo and had the corporate backing of a number of local Central Coast and some North Shore businesses. The proposed team would play 11 games in Gosford and one game at North Sydney Oval (Against arch rivals across the Spit and Roseville BridgesManly as part of a heritage or rivalry round). North Sydney legend David Fairleigh was proposed to become the inaugural coach. Prominent rugby league personalities who publicly backed the club include Phil Gould, Andrew Johns and Peter Sterling while support has also come from as high up as Federal Treasurer and North Sydney MP Joe Hockey.

Bears fan Alan McLoughlin, a Central Coast resident, set up a Facebook petition to bring the Bears to Gosford.

The Central Coast Bears had 7,200 financial members with new members joining weekly. They were aiming for 5,000 by March 2011, when the official bid was due to be handed in to the NRL but passed that mark in 2010. Mortgage House signed a three-year deal to sponsor the Central Coast Bears, also becoming a major jersey sponsor for the Bears. In November 2010, it was reported that Ken Sayer, CEO of Mortgage House, planned to underwrite the bid for $10 million to help ensure their financial equity was shored up when the bid was submitted. Both major political parties showed support for the Central Coast Bears bid in 2010–2011, with Labor supporting the bid by granting $100,000 for the Bears, and the Liberal party supporting the bid by promising to acquire land at Mt Penang, Central Coast, NSW to build a state-of-the-art Sports Centre of Excellence in the lead up to the 2011 New South Wales state election.

With weekly membership drives and ongoing community involvement, the Central Coast Bears targeted entry into the NRL in 2015, but this date passed without admission. In 2016, it was reported that there were moves for the Bears to buy the Gold Coast Titans franchise. The General Manager of Norths and most capped player of the club Greg Florimo said at the time of North Sydney&#x27;s first public interest in purchasing The Gold Coast licence as &quot;the last chance&quot;. Florimo then went on to say &quot;I don&#x27;t see too many other options presenting themselves, The energy and finance that we put into the Central Coast bid really didn&#x27;t come to fruition ... so we&#x27;re going hard to the plate on this&quot;.

Throughout 2017 there was much media speculation around North Sydney and their moves to purchase the struggling Gold Coast Titans licence when it went on sale by The NRL. North Sydney reportedly placed a $7 million bid to purchase The Gold Coast Licence and as part of the bid if they were to be successful was to rename the side The Gold Coast Bears and continue to play games at Robina plus taking two games to North Sydney Oval with one game being held against fierce rivals The Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. The Gold Coast colors would also change to Norths red and black with the logo being changed as well to fit the proposed new club. On 3 November 2017, it was revealed that Norths had failed in their bid to purchase The Gold Coast licence. On 14 December 2017, it was officially announced by The NRL that the consortium of Darryl Kelly and self made property tycoon Rebecca Frizelle had won the bid to purchase The Gold Coast Titans.

On 22 February 2018, it was announced that North Sydney were in talks with a Western Australian consortium with the possibility of creating a franchise and to seek inclusion into The NRL.

On 11 November 2018, new North Sydney CEO David Perry said he was aiming at seeing a North Sydney/Central Coast bid come to fruition when the current television deal ends at the end of 2023. Perry suggested that the NRL should look at creating a promotion/relegation system similar to other sports around the world. Perry went on to say &quot;You need 12 and 12, so 24 key markets, and stricter criteria about those clubs around their funding model which means all of the 24 may not fit the top tier criteria, it may only be 16-18 franchises that make the cut, their catchment areas, their population, and their commercial growth, because currently I believe a lot of clubs haven’t been accountable as much as they should have. They&#x27;ve been too reliant on funding from the NRL and haven&#x27;t been measurable enough&quot;.

On 9 August 2019, rugby league immortal Andrew Johns said that having a team on the Central Coast would be a &quot;no-brainer&quot;. Johns went on to say &quot;I think it’s a must, We keep talking about Perth, but it’s so far away I imagine the costs would be astronomical getting everyone over there and back. At the Central Coast they have a stadium up there and they have a huge junior base. There are so many players play up there, so you can get the best kids aspiring to play for the Central Coast&quot;.

On 25 September 2019, Australian entrepreneur John Singleton spoke to former NRL player Matthew Johns about a team being placed on the Central Coast. Singleton said &quot;We had the players and the lifestyle on the Central Coast once you get people up there they go: &#x27;wow, how good&#x27;s this&#x27;. I can live on the beach.&quot; Singleton then spoke about the Gold Coast Titans and how their bid beat Singleton&#x27;s initial bid for a Central Coast team in 2006 saying &quot;They had no money and no stadium, and we did have a stadium built for North Sydney. And was a year late, that&#x27;s all. And we had a $50 million bank guarantee, so we would have been strong. It made sense to relocate one of the Sydney teams to the Central Coast.&quot;

===The Bears===
After the Northern Eagles went defunct, the North Sydney Bears have continued to field teams in several grades of the NSW rugby league competitions, and were behind the failed Central Coast Bears bid in the mid-2000s. But as recently as April 2021 the Bears have expressed their intent on eventually returning the brand to the NRL competition. In 2018 they had explored the possibility of establishing a &quot;Western Bears&quot; franchise based in Perth.

On 27 October 2021, the Bears revealed their intention to return to the NRL, coinciding with a new logo. The proposed franchise, to be known simply as The Bears, would split home matches between various regional centres including Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Tamworth, Coffs Harbour and Central Coast, along with major cities Perth, Adelaide, Hobart and Darwin that are otherwise currently without NRL representation. They would allocate between four and six games at a potentially upgraded North Sydney Oval. The Bears intend to retain their 113-year history and traditional black and red colours.

===Western Bears===
In August 2024, the North Sydney Bears and a Western Australian consortium headed by Cash Converters founders the Cumins family, signed off on an agreement to lodge an application for the Western Bears to enter a team in the 2027 NRL season. The logo would have been red, white and black with yellow as a nod to Western Australia, not The Western Reds as had been incorrectly reported.
On 8 October 2024, the bid was rejected by the NRL.
On 12 December 2024, North Sydney and the West Australian consortium missed out on selection to be the 18th team in the competition. The NRL instead decided to choose the PNG bid with ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys stating &quot;The Western Australian situation is still progressing&quot;.

==North Sydney Leagues Club==
Rebranded as &quot;Norths,&quot; the North Sydney Leagues Club was established by the district&#x27;s football club, the North Sydney Bears, in 1955 in a house in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay. In 1964, the club moved to new premises, its current location, in Abbott Street, Cammeray.

In the fifty years the new building has stood, a number of redesigns and refurbishments have taken place. In 2014 facilities comprised two dining areas, function rooms, a 530-seat auditorium, a fitness and wellness centre, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, a bottle shop, a TAB, two squash courts, a courtesy bus service, a members rewards program and a multi-level car park for 320 vehicles. Membership in 2016 stood at 21,500.

In 1996, Norths merged with the North Sydney Bowling Club, which was established in 1888 and is the second oldest club (by one day) in Australia. This Bowling Club was transformed and re-branded as The Greens North Sydney in November 2014. Norths also amalgamated with the Seagulls, a border club at Tweed Heads on the far north coast of New South Wales, the oldest provincial rugby league club in Australia.

==Local catchment area==
Despite partially and fully leaving the NRL after the 1999 and 2001 seasons respectively, the Bears keep a large fanbase on Sydney&#x27;s Lower North Shore, Upper North Shore, and Hornsby Shire regions (Although it’s support is strongest on the Lower North Shore). The North Sydney Bears are the only Sydney team without NRL representatives to have a Junior Rugby League District, the North Sydney Junior Rugby League District, In which clubs compete in a joint district with Manly Warringah.

<text>The Bor District (, ; ) is one of nine administrative districts of Southern and Eastern Serbia. It has a population of 101,100 inhabitants, according to the 2022 census results. The administrative center of the Bor district is the city of Bor and the judicial one, due to tradition, Negotin. This district is the easternmost district of Serbia and contains the Serbian panhandle that extends into the Romanian border.

==History==
The Triballi dominated the region before the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC that weakened and subdued the Paleo-Balkan tribes. The Triballi, a Triballi-Dacian tribe, were defeated by the Roman army under Marcus Licinius Crassus, the consul of 30 BC. The region was organized into Moesia Inferior in 87 AD by Emperor Domitian.

Hellenistic religious influence is attested through archeological findings in Rovine and Tamnič where Heracles was worshipped, a relief of Zeus, Heracles and Dionysus found in Bukovo.

The Roman site of Selište with a necropolis has been excavated in the village of Rogljevo. Silver and gold fibulae from 250–320 AD have been found at sites in Negotin.

==Municipalities==
The district encompasses the city of Bor and three municipalities:
* Kladovo
* Majdanpek
* Negotin

==Demographics==

According to the last official census done in 2011, the Bor District has 124,992 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
The ethnic composition of the Bor district is as follows:
==Economy==
The region is a traditionally energy oriented, as it has the hydroelectric power plants of Đerdap: Iron Gate I and Iron Gate II, and is also rich in copper and gold deposits, especially in the Bor and Majdanpek areas; silver has also been discovered, but is rare. The giant mining company RTB Bor operates in the region.

<doc id="693237" wikidata="Q932736" url="?curid=693237" title="Volcanoes National Park">
<text>Volcanoes National Park is a national park in northwestern Rwanda. It covers of rainforest and encompasses five of the eight volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains, namely Karisimbi, Bisoke, Muhabura, Gahinga and Sabyinyo. It borders Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda. It is home to the mountain gorilla and the golden monkey, and was the base for the primatologist Dian Fossey.

==History==
The park was first gazetted in 1925, as a small area bounded by Karisimbi, Bisoke and Mikeno, intended to protect the gorillas from poachers. It was the very first national park to be created in Africa. In 1929, the borders of the park were extended further into Rwanda and into the Belgian Congo, to form the Albert National Park, a huge area of , run by the Belgian colonial authorities who were in charge of both colonies. In 1958, of the park were cleared for a human settlement.

Between 1969 and 1973, 1,050 hectares of the park were cleared to grow pyrethrum.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the indigenous Twa people were involuntarily resettled out of Volcanoes National Park.

The park later became the base for the American naturalist Dian Fossey to carry out her research on the gorillas. She arrived in 1967 and set up the Karisoke Research Centre between Karisimbi and Visoke. From then on, she spent most of her time in the park, and is widely credited with saving the gorillas from extinction by bringing their plight to the attention of the international community. She was murdered by unknown assailants at her home in 1985, a crime often attributed to the poachers she had spent her life fighting against. Fossey&#x27;s life later was portrayed on the big screen in the film &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, named after her autobiography. She is buried in the park in a grave close to the research center, and amongst the gorillas which became her life.

The Volcanoes National Park became a battlefield during the Rwandan Civil War, with the park headquarters being attacked in 1992. The research centre was abandoned, and all tourist activities (including visiting the gorillas) were stopped. They did not resume again until 1999 when the area was deemed to be safe and under control. There have been occasional infiltrations by Rwandan rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda in subsequent years, but these are always stopped quickly by the Rwandan army and there is thought to be no threat to tourism in the park.

Buhanga Eco-Park, an ancient woodland containing Rwanda&#x27;s most interesting folklore, and Musanze Caves, constructed 62 million years ago after the last estimated volcanic explosion, are both located inside the limits of Volcanoes National Park.

==Flora and fauna==
=== Flora===
Vegetation varies considerably due to the large altitudinal range within the park. There is some lower montane forest (now mainly lost to agriculture). Between 2400 and 2500 m, there is &quot;Neoboutonia&quot; forest. From 2500 to 3200 m &quot;Arundinaria alpina&quot; (bamboo) forest occurs, covering about 30% of the park area. From 2600 to 3600 m, mainly on the more humid slopes in the south and west, is &quot;Hagenia-Hypericum&quot; forest, which covers about 30% of the park. This is one of the largest forests of &quot;Hagenia abyssinica&quot;. The vegetation from 3500 to 4200 m is characterised by &quot;Lobelia wollastonii&quot;, &quot;L. lanurensis&quot;, and &quot;Senecio erici-rosenii&quot; and covers about 25% of the park. From 4300 to 4500 m grassland occurs. Secondary thicket, meadows, marshes, swamps and small lakes also occur, but their total area is relatively small.

===Fauna===

The park is best known for the mountain gorilla (&quot;Gorilla beringei beringei&quot;). Other mammals include: golden monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus mitis kandti&quot;), black-fronted duiker (&quot;Cephalophus niger&quot;), African buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer&quot;), spotted hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;) and harnessed bushbuck (&quot;Tragelaphus scriptus&quot;). The bushbuck population is estimated to be between 1760–7040 animals. There are also reported to be African elephants in the park, though these are now very rare. There are 178 recorded bird species, with at least 13 species and 16 subspecies endemic to the Virunga and Rwenzori Mountains.

==Expansion==
In 2022, the Government of Rwanda announced plans to expand this national park from to . Of the new , park activities will expand into an estimated new , and an estimated will be used to create a buffer zone between the national park and the surrounding human communities. The buffer zone will be used for agriculture, particularly agroforestry, which will benefit the park and the humans together. It is expected that this arrangement will reduce &quot;human-wildlife conflicts by 80 percent&quot;. Work was expected to start in 2022 and last five years, working with a budget of US$255 million. The Rwanda Development Board announced that a pilot program will begin in 2024.

<doc id="693248" wikidata="Q334494" url="?curid=693248" title="Borr">
<text>In Norse mythology, Borr or Burr (Old Norse: &#x27;borer&#x27; sometimes anglicized Bor, Bör or Bur) was the son of Búri. Borr was the husband of Bestla and the father of Odin, Vili and Vé. Borr receives mention in a poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century by Icelander Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed a variety of theories about the figure.

== Attestation ==
Borr is mentioned in the fourth verse of the &quot;Völuspá&quot;, a poem contained in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, and in the sixth chapter of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the second section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

=== &quot;Völuspá&quot; ===

=== &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; ===

Borr is not mentioned again in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. In skaldic and eddaic poetry, Odin is occasionally referred to as &quot;Borr&#x27;s son&quot;.

== Scholarly reception and interpretation ==
The role of Borr in Norse mythology is unclear. Nineteenth-century German scholar Jacob Grimm proposed to equate Borr with Mannus as related in Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot; on the basis of the similarity in their functions in Germanic theogeny.

The 19th century Icelandic scholar and archaeologist Finnur Magnússon hypothesized that Borr was &quot;intended to signify [...] the first mountain or mountain-chain, which it was deemed by the forefathers of our race had emerged from the waters in the same region where the first land made its appearance. This mountain chain is probably the Caucasus, called by the Persians &quot;Borz&quot; (the genitive of the Old Norse &quot;Borr&quot;). Bör&#x27;s wife, Belsta or Bestla, a daughter of the giant Bölthorn (&quot;spina calamitosa&quot;), is possibly the mass of ice formed on the alpine summits.&quot; In his &quot;Lexicon Mythologicum&quot;, published four years later, he modified his theory to claim that Borr symbolized the earth, and Bestla the ocean, which gave birth to Odin as the &quot;world spirit&quot; or &quot;great soul of the earth&quot; (&quot;spiritus mundi nostri; terrae magna anima, aëris et aurae numen&quot;), Vili or Hoenir as the &quot;heavenly light&quot; (&quot;lux, imprimis coelestis&quot;) and Vé or Lódur as &quot;fire&quot; (&quot;ignis, vel elementalis vel proprie sic dictus&quot;).

Highlighting that no source provides information about Borr&#x27;s mother (Borr&#x27;s father was licked free from the earth by the primeval cow Auðumbla), Rudolf Simek observes that &quot;It is not clear how Burr came to be&quot;.

<doc id="693254" wikidata="Q2005341" url="?curid=693254" title="Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Angel is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the American television programs &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;Angel&quot;. The character is portrayed by actor David Boreanaz. As introduced in &quot;Buffy&quot; in 1997, Angel is a love interest for heroine Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a young woman whose destiny as &quot;the Slayer&quot; is to fight the forces of evil, such as vampires and demons. However, their relationship is complicated by the fact that Angel is himself a vampire cursed with remorse and a human soul, which motivates him to assist Buffy in her duties as Slayer. The character&#x27;s popularity led to the production of the spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, which follows the character&#x27;s struggle towards redemption after moving to Los Angeles. In addition to the two television series, the character appears in the comic book continuations of both series, as well as much other expanded universe literature.

In the character&#x27;s backstory, he was born as Liam in 18th-century Ireland and, after being sired, assumed the name Angelus, achieving infamy as the most sadistic vampire in European history. After angering a Romani clan, he was cursed with his human soul, leading to great personal torment and the decision to resist the evil impulses that come with being a vampire. He later assumes the shortened name Angel, and over the course of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, he matures into an altruistic champion of mankind, and learns he is a central figure of several prophecies concerning an approaching apocalypse. In later editions of the comic series, Angel adopted the identity of the masked Twilight and gathered a cabal of humans and demons who had become wary of the rise of multiple Slayers.

&quot;Angel&quot; ended its five-year run in 2004. However, the canonical comic books &quot;&quot; (2007–2009), &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011) and &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; (2011–2013) depict the character&#x27;s continued story, in which he is caught up in events of cosmic proportion and must deal with the fallout from enormous mistakes he has made.

Season 2 of &quot;Buffy&quot; and season 4 of &quot;Angel&quot; feature storylines in which, deprived of his soul, he resumes his Angelus persona and torments and kills some of his allies. He has attracted significant interest due to his dichotomous personality in the presence or absence of his soul, and the ways in which his relationship with Buffy conforms to and subverts the tropes of romantic drama and horror fiction.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;===
Angel&#x27;s first appearance is in &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;, the first episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in 1997. In it, he meets the protagonist Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a young girl destined to fight evil in the small town of Sunnydale, California. For the first half of the season, Angel is an enigmatic love interest for Buffy, showing up only to offer her cryptic messages about upcoming threats. It is not until the episode &quot;Angel&quot; that the character is revealed to be a benevolent vampire from Galway, Ireland, who emigrated to the United States to escape his past as the sadistic Angelus after his soul was restored by a vengeful Romani clan. Although uneasy about trusting a vampire, Buffy and the Scooby Gang eventually come to view Angel as an ally. In the second season (1997–1998), Buffy and Angel&#x27;s romantic relationship develops and the pair make love in the episode &quot;Surprise&quot;. For experiencing a moment of pure happiness, however, the Romani curse on Angel is revoked, unleashing his soulless alter-ego, who reunites with his old friends, vampires Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau), and begins terrorizing Buffy and her friends. Upon discovering Romani descendant Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte), who is working to translate the text of a spell to restore Angel&#x27;s soul, Angelus murders her by breaking her neck, and places her body in the bed of her boyfriend, Giles (Anthony Head), for him to discover. Angelus then attempts to destroy the world by awakening the demon Acathla. In the season finale, neophyte witch Willow (Alyson Hannigan) manages to restore Angel&#x27;s soul at the last moment, but Buffy is forced to kill him to save the world from Acathla, and Angel is sent to hell. In season 3 (1998–1999), episode three, &quot;Faith, Hope &amp; Trick&quot;, Angel is inexplicably returned from hell by an unknown party and is soon found by Buffy. The Scooby Gang are outraged when they discover that Buffy has been secretly caring for him since his resurrection, but grudgingly accept him after he saves Willow&#x27;s life in episode seven, &quot;Revelations&quot;. In the episode &quot;Amends&quot;, the primordial First Evil attempts to manipulate Angel to murder Buffy, but Angel chooses suicide instead by waiting for the sun to rise on Christmas morning. California&#x27;s heatwave is suddenly interrupted by a freak snowstorm hiding the sun, sparing Angel&#x27;s life, which he takes as a sign from God that he was brought back for a reason. Buffy and Angel initially attempt to be friends but eventually resume their romance. However, Angel becomes more and more aware of their limitations as a couple and breaks up with her in the hopes that she will be happier without him, leaving Sunnydale altogether after attending Buffy&#x27;s prom and helping her in the battle against Mayor Wilkins (Harry Groener).

===&quot;Angel&quot;===
After his departure from &quot;Buffy&quot;, Angel appeared in his own spin-off series, titled &quot;Angel&quot;. Moving to Los Angeles, he starts a supernatural detective agency called Angel Investigations. He dedicates himself to &quot;helping the helpless,&quot; and becomes a Champion of The Powers That Be, who send him psychic visions through his employees Doyle (Glenn Quinn), and later Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). In doing so, he frequently clashes with the powerful law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart, who represent the evil of the world. During this season (1999–2000), Buffy and Angel appear in each other&#x27;s shows (the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Pangs&quot; and the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;), but are forced to accept that nothing has changed and they still can not or should not be together. Later in the television season, Buffy crosses over into the episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot; where she attempts to kill rogue Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) to whom Angel shows compassion, and Angel appears in &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Yoko Factor&quot; where he squares off with Buffy&#x27;s new boyfriend Riley (Marc Blucas). They finally decide to stay away from each other&#x27;s business and stick to phone calls at this point. In the season 1 finale, Angel is given some hope at redemption when the Shanshu prophecy reveals that a vampire with a soul may eventually become human after fulfilling his role in the upcoming apocalypse.

In season 2 (2000–2001), Angel discovers that Wolfram &amp; Hart has brought his sire and former lover Darla (Julie Benz) back from the dead in human form. Although Darla is intent on bringing back Angelus, Angel hopes to save her soul and help her seek redemption while she still has a chance. However, just as it looks like he might succeed, Wolfram &amp; Hart bring in Drusilla to turn Darla back into a vampire. Angry at the lawfirm and embracing his darker side, Angel fires his employees, Cordelia, Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and Gunn (J. August Richards) (secretly to protect them from this dark territory, as he later revealed to Lorne (Andy Hallett)), and embarks on a vendetta against Wolfram &amp; Hart, even allowing Darla and Dru to massacre a group of lawyers. Eventually losing faith in his mission, Angel has sex with Darla in the hopes of losing his soul. Instead, he experiences an epiphany and realizes that the good fight is still worth fighting. A disgusted Darla flees L.A. and Angel reconciles with his friends, who eventually forgive him. Angel also appears in &quot;Buffy&quot; season 5&#x27;s &quot;Forever&quot;, comforting Buffy after her mother&#x27;s death.

Season 3 (2001–2002) sees Angel struggle with fatherhood when Darla returns pregnant with his child, despite the fact that vampires supposedly are unable to conceive. When Darla kills herself to give birth, Angel is left to raise the baby Connor (played by triplets Connor, Jake and Trenton Tupen) and protect him from those who wish to get their hands on a child of two vampires. False prophecies, time travel, and betrayal lead to Angel losing his infant son to an old enemy, Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), who abducts Connor into a hell dimension where time passes differently. Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) returns days later, fully grown and under the belief that Angel is a soulless monster. Holtz kills himself and Angel is framed for his death by Holtz&#x27;s lover, prompting Connor to take revenge by sinking his father to the bottom of the ocean. Over the course of this season, Angel&#x27;s friendship with his colleague Cordelia evolves into romance, but circumstances prevent him from ever confessing his feelings.

In &quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s fourth season (2002–2003), Angel is rescued from the ocean by his former friend Wesley. As Los Angeles crumbles under signs of the apocalypse, Angel is forced to cope with the romantic relationship between his son and Cordelia. In order to find out more about the Beast (Vladimir Kulich) terrorizing L.A., Angel Investigations remove Angel&#x27;s soul and bring back Angelus after a vision from Cordelia suggests that Angelus has history with the Beast that Angel does not remember. Angelus, however, manages to escape, kills the Beast for fun and wreaks havoc until an old friend, Willow, manages to return his soul for the second time. It is eventually revealed that Cordelia has been possessed by the Beast&#x27;s master, Jasmine (Gina Torres), a higher power who manipulated many events in Angel&#x27;s life in order to be born in this world. Once born, she puts humanity under her thrall in the hopes of achieving world peace. When Angel restores free will and ruins Jasmine&#x27;s plan, Wolfram &amp; Hart offer him control of their L.A. branch as a reward for putting a stop to world peace. Angel accepts when they agree to rewrite Connor&#x27;s memories of growing up in hell, allowing him to live a normal life with a new family. Afterwards, Angel appears in the penultimate and final episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot;, presenting Buffy with an amulet, which is given to Spike, to help her battle the First Evil.

In the fifth and final season of &quot;Angel&quot; (2003–2004), the character has made a deal with the Devil to become CEO of Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s Los Angeles office. All of his friends have also become W&amp;H employees, hoping to reform the organization from within under Angel&#x27;s supervision. Angel&#x27;s life this season is complicated by the increasingly blurred line between good and evil, the deaths of loved ones Cordelia and Fred (Amy Acker), and the possibility that the Shanshu prophecy may in fact be referring to Spike (who is now also a vampire with a soul and has joined the team) and not Angel. Allowing his friends to believe he is being corrupted, Angel secretly plots to bring down the Senior Partners of Wolfram &amp; Hart by assassinating the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Partners&#x27; primary agents on Earth, even signing away his prophesied humanity in the process to convince them of his complex deception. Realizing that he may never be able to fully stop the forces of evil, Angel and his friends enter into a suicidal battle against the armies of the Senior Partners, and the series ends with the question of their survival unanswered.

Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for &quot;Buffy the Animated Series&quot;, which was set during the show&#x27;s first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Angel (voiced by David Boreanaz) in more adventures set during &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s first season. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.

===Comic books===
In 2007, Angel began appearing in two canonical continuations of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; from Joss Whedon. The first of these was &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, published by Dark Horse Comics, which continued the story of the &quot;Buffy&quot; television series. Later that year, Whedon and IDW Publishing released the series &quot;&quot;, which continued on from the series finale of &quot;Angel&quot;. The two series were published by different publishers due to Dark Horse initially giving up the rights to licensed &quot;Angel&quot; comic books several years ago when the series was still on air.

In Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;Buffy&quot; continuation, Angel initially appears to feature in Buffy&#x27;s dream sequences (in the comic&#x27;s third and twentieth issues, as well as in the &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; special &quot;Season Eight&quot; comic &quot;Always Darkest&quot;), but is later revealed to have been in the series from the beginning. He then features substantially in the remainder of the series. Angel features as the central character in IDW&#x27;s &quot;After the Fall&quot;, however, which has no crossover with the events of &quot;Buffy&quot;. Whedon devised the storyline for &quot;After the Fall&quot; issues 1-17 with writer Brian Lynch, but did not write for the series himself as with &quot;Buffy&quot;. Beginning with the eighteenth issue of the series, IDW chose to continue telling &quot;Angel&quot; stories in an ongoing comic book with rotating writers and artists, although these stories &quot;did not come from Whedon himself&quot;. In the continued series without Whedon&#x27;s involvement, Angel engages in episodic adventures, while the series also takes breaks to focus on other characters. Subsequent writers included Bill Willingham. When rights to &quot;Angel&quot; settings and characters reverted to Dark Horse, IDW promised to end their ongoing &quot;Angel&quot; series with its forty-fourth issue in 2011, and began negotiating with Dark Horse so that it would bridge continuity with &quot;Season Eight&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot;. Its final &quot;Angel&quot; story is the hardcover send-off &quot;Angel Yearbook&quot;. During its tenure, IDW also published various miniseries depicting Angel and related characters, such as John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Angel: Blood and Trenches&quot; (2009), and several &quot;Illyria&quot; and &quot;Spike&quot; stories.

In &quot;After the Fall&quot;, set after the fifth season, Angel and his friends struggle as Los Angeles has been moved to a hell dimension by the Senior Partners who have also turned Angel human as a punishment. With the help of Wesley&#x27;s ghost, magical spells to simulate his old abilities, and a friendly dragon (seen in &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;) which he names after Cordelia, Angel continues helping the helpless. Angel eventually outsmarts and kills the Demon Lords of Los Angeles to win the city back for its people. Gunn, now a vampire out for revenge against Angel following the fight in the alley, confronts Angel, and brings him to the point of death. Cordelia&#x27;s spirit comes to convince Angel to keep fighting, in spite of a vision of the &quot;final battle&quot; which sees Angel responsible for countless deaths. Wesley also confirms that Angel is still viable for the Shanshu prophecy, because his signed contract was never filed. Angel&#x27;s body is subsequently taken by the Senior Partners and restored to health while Gunn successfully manages to restore the demon Illyria (introduced in season 5) to her true form, hoping she will restore time to before the Fall of Los Angeles only to embark on a destructive rampage instead. Gunn kills Connor, but rather than avenge the death Angel allows Gunn to kill him, forcing the Senior Partners to restore time back to before the Fall, as he is necessary to their plans. Restored to the fight in the alley with memories intact, Angel saves Gunn this time and later is happily reunited with Connor. Angel enjoys celebrity status from the citizens of Los Angeles, and gives Cordelia the dragon over to Groosalugg. As a mark of respect for his friends, he names a wing of the Los Angeles public library after Wesley and Fred; Wesley is no longer a ghost. Angel leaves the human, traumatised Gunn an Angel Investigations card and returns to his duties helping the hopeless.

In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Twilight appears in the premiere issue, written by Whedon; his shoes are seen floating in the air as he surveys Buffy. At the end of the arc, the military general who coordinated a large-scale attack on Buffy is revealed to be a follower of &quot;Twilight&quot;; later issues show that many of the anti-Slayer forces serve under the leadership of a masked person known as Twilight. Buffy herself finally confronts Twilight in &quot;A Beautiful Sunset&quot;, along with the Slayer Satsu, but Twilight&#x27;s superior strength and ability to fly ensures his easy victory. In Jane Espenson&#x27;s story arc &quot;Retreat&quot;, Twilight locates Buffy&#x27;s allies through their use of magic, forcing them to converge and retreat. In Tibet, Slayers and witches suppress their magic, which ultimately leads to a mutually destructive military conflict between the Slayers and Twilight&#x27;s forces. In its aftermath, however, Buffy mysteriously acquires abilities conspicuously similar to Twilight&#x27;s. In the penultimate arc, written by Brad Meltzer, the newly empowered Buffy faces up to her masked enemy again. Twilight reveals himself to be Angel, and claims to have been distracting the various groups that would seek to destroy Buffy while pushing her towards some other end. Buffy and Angel — destiny&#x27;s agents in discarding the old reality and ushering in a new one — are overcome with desire for one another. They kiss, have sex and fly through space, eventually ascending to a dimension called Twilight. Meanwhile, Giles exposits a prophecy pertaining to the creation of a new universe, brought about by a Slayer falling in love with a vampire. The two come to their senses and return to Earth to fight off the hordes of demons unleashed by their ascension. Espenson&#x27;s &quot;Riley&quot; one-shot flashes back to an uneasy Angel, early in his Twilight masquerade, convinced by Whistler (Angel&#x27;s mentor in flashbacks from &quot;Buffy&quot; season 2) that this course of actions leads to the only possible future in which Buffy survives. The final arc, &quot;Last Gleaming&quot;, depicts Angel&#x27;s first encounter with the higher power which bestowed Twilight&#x27;s superheroic abilities on him. Spike explains the next step in the prophecy, which concerns the new universe springing from the mystical Seed of Wonder, a source for all the magic in the universe, buried beneath Sunnydale. Although he tries to stop more of the damage caused by the Twilight dimension&#x27;s coming, the Twilight dimension (the aforementioned higher power) possesses Angel. To protect the seed, a possessed Angel then tries to kill Buffy and Spike, and goes so far as to snap Giles&#x27; neck. This prompts Buffy to destroy the Seed. This stops the Twilight dimension from destroying the existing world, and Angel is dispossessed, but the universe is also stripped of all magic.

Following on from this, Angel headlines the series &quot;Angel and Faith&quot;, primarily set in London. Its stories aim to be respectful to the storylines featured in IDW&#x27;s forty-four issue &quot;Angel&quot; run, and maintains a very tight continuity with &quot;Buffy Season Nine&quot; and other related comics. In his series, Angel faces the looming threat of his now unstable former mentor Whistler, who helped bring about his transformation into Twilight, as well as his two dangerous former acolytes, half-demons Pearl and Nash, in addition a group of British Slayers who cannot forgive his actions as Twilight. Along with Faith, he lives in Giles&#x27; London apartment where they are joined by Giles&#x27; ageless aunts, witches Lavinia and Sophronia. Angel intends to honor Giles&#x27; memory, and seeks to collect fragments of Giles&#x27; soul from magical items as part of a plan to resurrect him. In the series&#x27; conclusion, Giles is successfully resurrected, albeit as a young teenage boy, and the gang pursue Whistler, Pearl and Nash to a rooftop, where they plan to unleash a horrific magical plague on the world as an inelegant means to restore magic to the universe. Nash is killed, and Angel is able to persuade Whistler to see the error of his ways, successfully limiting to the extent of the plague to an area of Hackney in London. In the season&#x27;s denouement, Faith returns to America alongside Giles, while Angel remains behind to guard over the plagued neighborhood, now called Magic Town, where residents—magically mutated into all manner of creature—are already causing problems.

A second volume of the series launched alongside &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot; in 2014. Angel defends Magic Town against threats such as Amy Madison during Faith&#x27;s absence, and acquires several new allies: Eldre Koh, an ancient Nitobe demon freed from his prison by the end of magic; Detective Brandt; Rory, a magically-mutated bartender; and the mutant Tricia and her boyfriend Parker. Angel is also aided by Sophronia and Lavinia, as well as Nadira, a Slayer who hated him for his actions as Twilight but found inner peace after being mutated, and has a deep connection with the magic of Magic Town, which has become sentient. Following Illyria&#x27;s death in &quot;Buffy Season Nine&quot;, Angel finds Fred alive again, having been restored by the reset of the laws of magic; she is forced to share her body with Illyria but is able to keep the ancient demon mostly under control. Faith also returns, now working for Zane Pharmaceuticals. A crossover with &quot;Buffy Season Ten&quot; reveals a new demon villain: Archaeus, who sired the Master and is able to control all the vampires from that bloodline, including Angel, Spike and Drusilla. Angel travels to San Francisco to help Buffy combat the demon lord, discovering that Buffy and Spike are now in a relationship, which Angel believes will not last. Meanwhile, Faith and Fred discover Drusilla in Magic Town, building a vampire army for Archaeus, who follows Angel back to London. The season ends with a conflict between Archaeus and his vampire army (including Drusilla and Detective Brandt), and Angel and his makeshift &#x27;family&#x27; (Faith, Fred/Illyria, Koh, Nadira, Sophronia and Lavinia, and the Magic Town populace). Observing the battle, the sentient magic is almost convinced to join Archaeus, but ultimately defends Nadira from him and traps Archaeus inside a statue.

==Reception==
&quot;SFX&quot; magazine named Angel as the third greatest vampire in television and film, with rival Spike in first place. They stated that, while he could have worked simply as a brooding love-interest (&quot;Buffy&quot;) or redemption-seeking hero (&quot;Angel&quot;), the character also has a &quot;wonderfully appealing, self-effacing humour, helped no end by Boreanaz&#x27;s ability to look like a slapped puppy&quot;. While Angel could be &quot;big and hard and manly&quot;, he could also be &quot;sulky, pathetic, in need of a hug&quot;. They also cite his poor singing and dancing as examples of his &quot;amusing awkwardness&quot;, which &quot;spoke volumes about who he was&quot;. For his role in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; season 2, &quot;Whatculture&quot; placed Angelus at number 1 on their list of &quot;Buffy&quot; Big Bads, alongside Spike and Drusilla, stating that having Buffy&#x27;s lover become her enemy &quot;emphasiz[es] the tragedy at the show’s centre that Buffy’s Slayer responsibilities mean she has to make difficult choices.&quot;

Angel was voted by thousands of &quot;Hello!&quot; readers as the sexiest on-screen vampire in 2009. He gathered 34 percent of the vote and finished ahead of other popular vampires like Edward Cullen, Eric Northman, Lestat de Lioncourt and Spike. &quot;Forbes&quot; named the series &quot;Angel&quot; as Hollywood&#x27;s second most powerful vampire show. Rankings were based on television ratings, inflation-adjusted box office performance, as well as presence in popular culture through blog and press mentions since 1979.

<text>Tjörnin () is a small, prominent lake in central Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Most visitors to the city pass along its shore, as it is situated in the city centre next to the Reykjavik City Hall and several museums. &quot;Tjörnin&quot; means &quot;the pond&quot;.

Feeding the birds on the lake shores is a popular pastime, so much that it has been referred to as &quot;the biggest bread soup in the world&quot;.

==Geography==

Tjörnin is described as a lagoon next to a barrier beach. The lake&#x27;s formation is attributed to the lagoon which was part of a reef that existed at the present location of Hafnarstræti (a city street, &quot;Harbour Street&quot;). This street, which passes through the business section of the city, lies on the southern side of the lake and leads to the gardens. The Vatnsmýri marsh feeds the lake. The outflow from the lake is Lækurinn, previously an open water channel flowing through the city centre, but since 1911 part of the sewage system under Lækjargata. During the winter, the lake usually freezes periodically and is used for ice skating. The average depth is 0.57m (1.9 feet) with the deepest point at 0.8m (2.4 feet). Both banks of the lake are paved and terminate at the Hljómskálagarður (formally known as Tjarnargarður), a well-tended park decorated with statues to the south of the lake. The winding paths are frequented by joggers and cyclists. Notice boards along the shore give daily reports of the numbers of birds on the lake.

==Avifauna==

The lake is frequented by between 40 and 50 species of water birds, including the Arctic tern, the Eider, the Gadwall, the Greylag goose and other species of goose, the Mallard, several species of seagulls, and the scaup. Whooper swan are viewable within close proximity. The Arctic tern’s arrival heralds the start of summer. Birders from all over the North Atlantic come to pursue their hobby in the lake area. The lake is also a favorite place to take young children to watch and feed birds. The popularity of bird feeding has led to the lake being poetically referred to as &quot;the biggest bread soup in the world&quot; (&quot;stærsta brauðsúpa í heimi&quot;). Lately, however, preying seagulls have caused the City Council to issue warnings to residents, asking them to refrain from feeding the ducks in Tjörnin to avoid putting ducklings at risk.

==Cityscape==

The earliest urban development of Reykjavík took place between the lake and the northern coast of the peninsula. Over the years, the lake became an integral part of the urban environment. 
Development of the city has centered around the lake. The postmodern City Hall, &quot;Ráðhúsið&quot;, stands in the northwest corner on the edge of the lake: it looks as if it is rising out of the lake. Other notable buildings in the area are those of the Supreme Court, Reykjavík Art Museum, the National Museum, the Living Art Museum, Reykjavík City Library, and the National Theatre, as well as the Parliament building, which houses the Parliament of Iceland, and the &quot;Dómkirkja&quot; cathedral, apart from a shopping complex and restaurants. Several buildings belonging to the University of Iceland are also close by.

Reykjavík airport is situated immediately south of the lake, on the other side of the Hringbraut thoroughfare.

A wooden pedestrian bridge was built over Tjörnin in 1920. To accommodate motorized traffic, the original construction was replaced in 1942 by a concrete bridge which is still in use.

==Conservation==
Vatnsmýrin Reserve, the protected area around Tjörnin, has deteriorated in recent years as evidenced by a drop in
the variety of reported birds. Part of the issue is attributed to the lack of appropriate nesting grounds due to invasive flora species as well as the presence of animals in the reserve. Action plans have been initiated jointly by the Nordic House, the University of Iceland, and Reykjavík City Council, to improve the reserve&#x27;s condition with appropriate wetland vegetation, construction of embankments and sedimentation ponds to improve the water flow, as well as some desilting of the lake.

==In popular culture==

Tjörnin was the setting for scenes in the 2010 film &quot;Gauragangur&quot; as well as a tragic scene from the 2014 film &quot;Life in a Fishbowl&quot;.

<doc id="693263" wikidata="Q852860" url="?curid=693263" title="Lonchura">
<text>Lonchura is a genus of the estrildid finch family, and includes munias (or minias) and mannikins. They are seed-eating birds that are found in South Asia from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka east to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. The name mannikin is from Middle Dutch &quot;mannekijn&quot; &#x27;little man&#x27;, and also the source of the common name of the family Pipridae, manakin.

Some of the &quot;Lonchura&quot; species were formerly placed in &quot;Spermestes&quot;. Others have been placed in a genus of their own, &quot;Euodice&quot;.

==Characteristics==
They are small gregarious birds which feed mainly on seeds, usually in relatively open habitats, preferring to feed on the ground or on reeds of grasses. Several species have been noted to feed on algae such as &quot;Spirogyra&quot;.
The nest is a large domed grass structure into which four to ten white eggs are laid. Some species also build communal roosting nests for overnight rest.

The species in this genus are similar in size and structure, with stubby bills, stocky bodies and long tails. Most are 10–12 cm in length. Plumage is usually a combination of browns, black and white, with the sexes similar, but duller and less contrasted for immature birds.

The similarities within this group and the existence of subspecies with differing vocalisations and plumage mean that some races may be elevated to species status. African and Indian silverbill are now usually considered distinct species in the Genus &quot;Euodice&quot;, and the two races of black-throated munia are often also split.

The munias are popular in the bird trade and many freed or escaped birds have formed feral colonies in different pockets across the world.

The red munia &quot;Amandava amandava&quot; and green munia &quot;Amandava formosa&quot; also take the name munia, but are in the genus &quot;Amandava&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lonchura&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist William Henry Sykes in 1832. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;lonkhē&quot; meaning &quot;spear-head&quot; or &quot;lance&quot; with &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;. Sykes included three species in the genus and of these the type species was designated as &quot;Fringilla nisoria&quot; Temminck 1830 by Arend Wiegmann in 1835. This taxon is now a subspecies, &quot;Loxia punctulata nisoria&quot;, of the scaly-breasted munia.

===Species===
The genus contains 28 species:

<text>The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a prominent bundle of nerve fibres which pass within the ventral/anterior portion of periaqueductal gray of the mesencephalon (midbrain). It contains the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, responsible for oculomotor control, head posture, and vertical eye movement.

The MLF interconnects interneurons of each abducens nucleus with motor neurons of the contralateral oculomotor nucleus; thus, the MLF mediates coordination of horizontal (side to side) eye movements, ensuring the two eyes move in unison (thus also enabling saccadic eye movements). The MLF also contains fibers projecting from the vestibular nuclei to the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei as well as the interstitial nucleus of Cajal; these connections ensure that eye movements are coordinated with head movements (as sensed by the vestibular system).
The medial longitudinal fasciculus is the main central connection for the oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, and abducens nerve. It carries information about the direction that the eyes should move. Lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus can cause nystagmus and diplopia, which may be associated with multiple sclerosis, a neoplasm, or a stroke.

== Anatomy ==
The MLF is the main intersegmental tract of the brainstem. It extends across the dorsal tegmentum of all three parts of the brainstem, as well as reaching caudally into the upper cervical spinal cord levels.

Descending fibers arise from the superior colliculus in the rostral midbrain (for visual reflexes), the accessory oculomotor nuclei in the rostral midbrain for visual tracking, and the pontine reticular formation, which facilitates extensor muscle tone. Ascending tracts arise from the vestibular nucleus and terminate in the oculomotor nucleus (of the oculomotor nerve, CN III), the trochlear nucleus (of the trochlear nerve, CN IV), and the abducens nucleus (of the abducens nerve, CN VI).

=== Structure ===
It contains the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the rostral interstitial nucleus (riMLF) (the vertical gaze center). 

=== Pathways ===

==== Horizontal conjugate gaze ====

The paramedian pontine reticular formation (PMPRF) is involved in coordinating horizontal conjugate eye movements and saccades. To do so, besides projecting to the ibsilateral abducens nucleus, the PMPRF projects fibers through the MLF to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (specifically, those of its motor neurons that innervate the medial rectus muscle).

==== Interstitial nucleus of Cajal ====
The interstitial nucleus of Cajal receives some ascending afferents from the vestibular nuclei via the MLF; the nucleus in turn projects descending efferents via the MLF back to the (superior and medial) vestibular nuclei, as well as to all levels of the spinal cord.

==== Vestibulo-ocular reflex ====
As part of the &quot;ascending&quot; MLF, the vestibular nuclei also project to the nuclei of all cranial nerves that control eye movements (i.e. oculomotor, abducens, and trochlear nuclei) to coordinate head-eye movements via the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

==== Perihypoglossal nuclei ====

The three perihypoglossal nuclei project efferents to the three cranial nerve nuclei controlling extrinsic eye muscles through the MLF.

==== Medial vestibulospinal tract ====
The vestibulocerebellum receives vestibulocerebellar fibers from the vestibular nuclei, then projects back to the vestibular nuclei to influence medial vestibulospinal tract (MVST). The MVST then projects bilaterally to cervical and upper thoracic levels of the spinal cord to control head/neck movements in order to coordinate head-eye movements. In the cervical spinal cord, it descends as a component of the &quot;descending&quot; MLF.

==== Tectospinal tract ====
The tectospinal tract originates in the superior colliculus and tectum of the mesencephalon (midbrain). It projects to the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord to mediate reflex turning of the head and trunk in the direction of startling sensations. In the medulla oblongata, it descends within the MLF.

=== Relations ===
In the midbrain, the MLF is situated just ventral to the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei.

In the pons, the MLF is situated just ventral/anterior to the abducens nucleus.

== Clinical significance ==
A lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus produces slowed or absent adduction of the ipsilateral eye upon contralateral gaze. This is usually associated with involuntary jerky eye movements (nystagmus) of the abducting eye, a syndrome called internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Because multiple sclerosis causes demyelination of the axons of the central nervous system, it can cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia when medial longitudinal fasciculus axons get demyelinated. This presents as nystagmus and diplopia. Other demyelinating diseases, as well as certain neoplasms and strokes, can also cause the same symptoms.

== History ==
In 1846, neurologist Benedict Stilling first referred to the medial longitudinal fasciculus as the &quot;acusticus&quot;. This was followed by Theodor Meynert in 1872 calling it &quot;posterior&quot;. In 1891, Heinrich Schutz chose the name &quot;dorsal&quot; to describe the longitudinal bundle. This name stuck despite other authors attempting further renaming (Ramon y Cajal&#x27;s &quot;periependymal&quot; in 1904, Theodor Ziehen&#x27;s &quot;nubecula dorsalis&quot; in 1913). Finally, Wilhelm His Sr. changed the name to &quot;medial&quot; to comply with Basle nomenclature.

<text>Jonathan &quot;Bates&quot; Battaglia (born December 13, 1975) is an American former professional ice hockey left winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Washington Capitals and the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1997 to 2008. He finished his professional career in 2012 with Karlskrona HK of the Swedish HockeyAllsvenskan.

==Playing career==
Battaglia was drafted by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the sixth round, 132nd overall, of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Growing up, Bates played hockey in Park Ridge, Illinois, under coach Tom Godwin. He played on the three-time NCAA National Championship-winning Lake Superior State University Lakers ice hockey team from 1994 to 1997.

On March 18, 1997, Battaglia was traded by the Mighty Ducks to the Hartford Whalers for Mark Janssens. He made his professional debut in the 1997–98 season with the Beast of New Haven of the American Hockey League (AHL) before making his NHL debut with the Carolina Hurricanes in their inaugural season in Raleigh, having relocated from Hartford, Connecticut. Battaglia established himself as an NHL regular with the Hurricanes, enjoying his most successful period as a third of the &quot;BBC line&quot; (consisting of Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, Battaglia and Erik Cole) during their run to the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals.

On March 11, 2003, Battaglia was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Radim Vrbata. His tenure with Colorado was short, as he was traded at the start of the 2003–04 season (along with Jonas Johansson) to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Steve Konowalchuk.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, on February 21, 2005, Battaglia joined his younger brother Anthony on the Mississippi Sea Wolves of the ECHL for the 2004–05 season.

On October 2, 2005, Battaglia was signed by the AHL&#x27;s Toronto Marlies to a one-year contract. For the following season, on July 2, 2006, he signed as a free agent with the Marlies&#x27; NHL parent club, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to a one-year contract. On July 2, 2007, he re-signed as a free agent with the Maple Leafs to a two-year contract. On December 13, 2007, he was assigned to the Marlies on a conditioning stint, but was left in the minors for the duration of the season. He was again assigned to the Marlies at the start of the 2008–09 season and scored a respectable 51 points in 59 games for the Marlies.

A free agent in the 2009–10 season, on November 11, 2009, Battaglia signed with the AHL&#x27;s Syracuse Crunch. After 29 games with the Crunch, he left the club after signing a contract for the rest of the season with Finnish team Jokerit of the SM-liiga as an injury replacement on January 28, 2010.

On December 8, 2010, Battaglia signed a 25-game professional try-out contract with the AHL&#x27;s Rochester Americans. After contributing only 3 points in 20 games with the Americans, he was released and signed with Lausitzer Füchse of the German 2nd Bundesliga. Battaglia&#x27;s brief stay with Füchse was limited to two games due to injury, and on March 16, 2011, he returned to North America and signed to again join his brother Anthony, this time with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League.

In November 2011, Battaglia signed with Karlskrona HK of the Swedish Division 1. In the 2011–12 season, Battaglia scored 23 points in 25 games to help Karlskrona gain promotion to the HockeyAllsvenskan. Battaglia finished third among import players in league scoring behind Andrew Fournier and Bill Keenan.

==Personal life==
Battaglia is the grandson of former Chicago Outfit mobster Sam Battaglia, although this family connection has been downplayed by Battaglia in interviews.
Bates and his brother Anthony competed in twenty-second season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and won the season.

<text>The lake Sigöldulón () is a reservoir in Iceland, also known as Krókslón . Situated in the south of the country, not far from Landmannalaugar, it is one of the country&#x27;s 20 largest lakes at 14 km2.

Both the lake and the nearby power station (Sigölduvirkjun ) take their names from a tuff ridge at about 600 m above sea level where the river Tungnaá once passed through a canyon. Its waters now flow in tubes into the power station, constructed between 1973 and 1977.

<text>Noncommutative logic is an extension of linear logic that combines the commutative connectives of linear logic with the noncommutative multiplicative connectives of the Lambek calculus. Its sequent calculus relies on the structure of order varieties (a family of cyclic orders that may be viewed as a species of structure), and the correctness criterion for its proof nets is given in terms of partial permutations. It also has a denotational semantics in which formulas are interpreted by modules over some specific Hopf algebras.

==Noncommutativity in logic==

By extension, the term noncommutative logic is also used by a number of authors to refer to a family of substructural logics in which the exchange rule is inadmissible. The remainder of this article is devoted to a presentation of this acceptance of the term.

The oldest noncommutative logic is the Lambek calculus, which gave rise to the class of logics known as categorial grammars. Since the publication of Jean-Yves Girard&#x27;s linear logic there have been several new noncommutative logics proposed, namely the cyclic linear logic of David Yetter, the pomset logic of Christian Retoré, and the noncommutative logics BV and NEL.

Noncommutative logic is sometimes called ordered logic, since it is possible with most proposed noncommutative logics to impose a total or partial order on the formulas in sequents. However this is not fully general since some noncommutative logics do not support such an order, such as Yetter&#x27;s cyclic linear logic. Although most noncommutative logics do not allow weakening or contraction together with noncommutativity, this restriction is not necessary.

===The Lambek calculus===
Joachim Lambek proposed the first noncommutative logic in his 1958 paper &quot;Mathematics of Sentence Structure&quot; to model the combinatory possibilities of the syntax of natural languages. His calculus has thus become one of the fundamental formalisms of computational linguistics.

===Cyclic linear logic===

David N. Yetter proposed a weaker structural rule in place of the exchange rule of linear logic, yielding cyclic linear logic. Sequents of cyclic linear logic form a cycle, and so are invariant under rotation, where multipremise rules glue their cycles together at the formulas described in the rules. The calculus supports three structural modalities, a self-dual modality allowing exchange, but still linear, and the usual exponentials (? and !) of linear logic, allowing nonlinear structural rules to be used together with exchange.

===Pomset logic===

Pomset logic was proposed by Christian Retoré in a semantic formalism with two dual sequential operators existing together with the usual tensor product and par operators of linear logic, the first logic proposed to have both commutative and noncommutative operators. A sequent calculus for the logic was given, but it lacked a cut-elimination theorem; instead the sense of the calculus was established through a denotational semantics.

===BV and NEL===

Alessio Guglielmi proposed a variation of Retoré&#x27;s calculus, BV, in which the two noncommutative operations are collapsed onto a single, self-dual, operator, and proposed a novel proof calculus, the calculus of structures to accommodate the calculus. The principal novelty of the calculus of structures was its pervasive use of deep inference, which it was argued is necessary for calculi combining commutative and noncommutative operators; this explanation concurs with the difficulty of designing sequent systems for pomset logic that have cut-elimination.

Lutz Straßburger devised a related system, NEL, also in the calculus of structures in which linear logic with the mix rule appears as a subsystem.

===Structads===

Structads are an approach to the semantics of logic that are based upon generalising the notion of sequent along the lines of Joyal&#x27;s combinatorial species, allowing the treatment of more drastically nonstandard logics than those described above, where, for example, the &#x27;,&#x27; of the sequent calculus is not associative.

<text>Military surplus is goods, usually materiel, that are sold or otherwise disposed of when held in excess or are no longer needed by the military. Entrepreneurs often buy these goods and resell them at surplus stores. Usually the goods sold by the military are clothing, equipment, and tools of a nature that is generally useful to the civilian population, as well as embroidered patches, name tags, and other items that can be used for a faux military uniform. Occasionally, vehicles (jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be sold as well. Some military surplus dealers also sell military surplus firearms, spare parts, and ammunition alongside surplus uniforms and equipment.

Demand for such items comes from various collectors, outdoorsmen, adventurers, hunters, survivalists, and players of airsoft and paintball, as well as others seeking high quality, sturdy, military issue garb. Reenactment groups usually seek historically-accurate restrike uniforms and equipment for displays, filmwork etc.

The goods may be used, or not. Some merchants of surplus goods also sell goods that are privately manufactured in military standards. Most items that are sold in military surplus stores in the United States are deemed &quot;military grade&quot;. This designation refers to meeting a relevant United States Military Standard. For example, uniforms meet Army Regulation 670-1.

==History==

The history of army surplus in the United States dates back to the American Civil War. This was the first large American war that required proper military uniforms for many troops. In earlier wars, most troops were basically a militia wearing whatever they had with them. This required mass-produced wears and arms for both sides. After the war, to recoup some money, they sold the supplies in stores. Thus the military surplus store was born.

In the 1870s, Francis Bannerman VI operated &quot;Bannerman&#x27;s surplus&quot;. His surplus company was one of the largest ever to operate. He built Bannerman&#x27;s Castle, a massive storage facility on Pollepel Island in the Hudson River, to store his goods.

<doc id="693286" wikidata="Q7883717" url="?curid=693286" title="Undermind (album)">
<text>Undermind is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Phish, released on June 15, 2004 by Elektra Records. The album was the group&#x27;s last release before they disbanded in August 2004. It is also their final studio release for Elektra Records (or a major record label for that matter); When the band reunited in 2009, their subsequent albums would be released through their own JEMP Records label which had launched in December 2005 for live releases.

==Contents==

The album&#x27;s cover art appears to be a direct nod to &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the final studio album by The Beatles. In a review of &quot;Undermind&quot;, &quot;Glide Magazine&quot; suggests that the album&#x27;s individual song contributions may also be intentionally &quot;Beatles-esque&quot;. While the bulk of the songs are by frontman Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, keyboard player Page McConnell, bass guitarist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman all contributed one song each. &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is the album&#x27;s only instrumental.

The introductory passage of &quot;Scents and Subtle Sounds&quot;, which opens the album, is taken from a demo recorded by Phish frontman Trey Anastasio and the band&#x27;s primary lyricist Tom Marshall. The track marks Marshall&#x27;s first vocal contribution to a Phish album. In concert, this intro is regularly performed as the first verse of the main &quot;Scents and Subtle Sounds&quot;.

Early copies of the album included a DVD with the 25 minute documentary &quot;Specimens of Beauty&quot;, a behind-the-scenes film on the making of &quot;Undermind&quot;, directed by Danny Clinch.

An extended improvisational studio jam recorded at the start of the &quot;Undermind&quot; sessions was later released as the &quot;Headphones Jam&quot; at LivePhish.com. Two excerpts from the &quot;Headphones Jam&quot; were used for the &quot;Undermind&quot; album: &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Tiny&quot; (an internet-only bonus track).

==Reception and legacy==

Many reviews praised &quot;The Connection&quot;, calling it &quot;the most commanding&quot; and &quot;most commercially accessible&quot; song of Phish&#x27;s recording career to date. The song never became a regular fixture in the band&#x27;s live rotation, and has only been performed six times as of 2024.

One month before the album&#x27;s release, Anastasio (and separately, McConnell) announced on Phish.com that the band would split following their summer tour. As such, a number of the songs were not performed live before the break up, though most have been played since the band&#x27;s return in 2009, with &quot;Scents and Subtle Sounds&quot;, the title track and &quot;A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing&quot; ultimately entering the band&#x27;s setlist rotation. &quot;Undermind&quot;&#x27;s songs remain among the least played originals in Phish&#x27;s large catalog.

In February 2009, &quot;Undermind&quot; was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

<text>Materiel or matériel (; ) is supplies, equipment, and weapons in military supply-chain management, and typically supplies and equipment in a commercial supply chain context.

==Military==
In a military context, the term &quot;materiel&quot; refers either to the specific needs (excluding manpower) of a force to complete a specific mission, or the general sense of the needs (excluding manpower) of a functioning army.

An important category of materiel is commonly referred to as ordnance, especially concerning mounted guns (artillery) and the shells they consume. Along with fuel, and munitions in general, the steady supply of ordnance is an ongoing logistical challenge in active combat zones. 

Materiel management consists of continuing actions relating to planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, controlling, and evaluating the application of resources to ensure the effective and economical support of military forces. It includes provisioning, cataloging, requirements determination, acquisition, distribution, maintenance, and disposal. The terms &quot;materiel management&quot;, &quot;materiel control&quot;, &quot;inventory control&quot;, &quot;inventory management&quot;, and &quot;supply management&quot; are synonymous.

Military materiel is often shipped to and used in severe climates without controlled warehouses or fixed material handling equipment. Packaging and labeling often need to meet stringent technical specifications to help ensure proper delivery and final use. Some military procurement allows for commercial packaging rather than the more stringent military grades.

==Commercial==
Materiel in the commercial distribution context refers to the products of the business, as distinct from those involved in operating the business itself.

<text>Nolan Baumgartner (born March 23, 1976) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently an assistant coach for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was formerly an assistant coach with the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL. Baumgartner was selected by the Washington Capitals in the 1st round (10th overall) of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He played parts of ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for six different teams between 1995 and 2010. Baumgartner played only one full season in the NHL, 2005–06 with the Vancouver Canucks, and spent most of his playing career in the AHL.

==Playing career==
Coming off a 1994 Memorial Cup championship with the Kamloops Blazers of the WHL, Baumgartner was chosen by the Washington Capitals in the first round, 10th overall of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, he returned to the WHL and joined future NHLers Darcy Tucker, Shane Doan and Jarome Iginla to capture a second consecutive Memorial Cup in 1995. Baumgartner was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team for the second consecutive year. En route to the CHL championship, Baumgartner was distinguished with the airBC Trophy as the WHL playoffs MVP after scoring 17 points in 21 games and at the season&#x27;s end, he was also awarded the Bill Hunter Trophy as the league&#x27;s best defenceman.

Baumgartner&#x27;s NHL career got off to an uneven start due to a serious shoulder injury. After playing the majority of his tenure in Washington with the Capitals&#x27; American Hockey League affiliate, the Portland Pirates, he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks on July 20, 2000, for Rémi Royer. Baumgartner would continue to play in the AHL with Chicago&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.

On July 11, 2002, he was signed as a free agent by the Vancouver Canucks. After one season with the Canucks, he was left unprotected for the 2003 NHL Waiver Draft and selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 3, 2003. However, after just five games with the Penguins, he was placed on waivers again and reclaimed by Vancouver on November 1. Playing with the Canucks&#x27; AHL affiliate, Baumgartner captained the Manitoba Moose in the season of 2003–04 and scored, 27 points. As the Moose began play at the newly opened MTS Center in 2004–05, Baumgartner earned the distinction of scoring the first ever professional goal at the arena, on November 17, 2004. When NHL play resumed the following season, Baumgartner cracked the Canucks regular lineup and set NHL career highs in every statistical category, as well as leading all team defencemen with 34 points.

Following Baumgartner&#x27;s breakout season, he became an unrestricted free agent, and on July 1, 2006, he signed a two-year deal with the Philadelphia Flyers. However, after six games, he was waived on October 17, 2006, and assigned to the Philadelphia Phantoms of the AHL a week later. Baumgartner was claimed on re-entry waivers by the Dallas Stars on February 24, 2007, and after spending the 2007–08 season with Dallas&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Iowa Stars, Baumgartner was reassigned by Dallas to the Manitoba Moose.

On July 2, 2008, he returned for a third stint with the Canucks, signing a one-year, two-way contract. He continued to play in the AHL for the Moose in 2008–09 and recorded 33 points in 72 games. He helped the Moose to the 2009 Calder Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the Hershey Bears. The following season, Baumgartner was named captain of the Canadian team for the 2010 AHL All-Star Game. He was called up by the Canucks on January 22, 2010, to replace injured defenceman Sami Salo.
On October 20, 2010, Baumgartner was named captain of the Manitoba Moose. This was Baumgartner&#x27;s second stint as Moose captain, when he held this position during the 2005-06 AHL season.

Baumgarter retired from hockey at the end of the 2011–12 season with the Chicago Wolves and was named an assistant coach of the team.

==International play==
Baumgartner represented Team Canada twice in the World Junior Championships (1995, 1996), captaining the team in 1996 and capturing gold both years

==Coaching career==
On July 6, 2012 the Vancouver Canucks announced that Baumgartner would be an assistant coach with their AHL affiliate in Chicago. On June 14, 2013 The Vancouver Canucks relocated their AHL team to Utica, New York. Baumgartner was subsequently hired to be an assistant coach with the new Utica Comets. On June 7, 2017, Baumgartner was named as an assistant coach of the Vancouver Canucks. Baumgartner was relieved of his duties by the Canucks on December 5, 2021 alongside head coach Travis Green

Baumgartner was hired on June 4, 2024 as an assistant coach with the Ottawa Senators.

<doc id="693301" wikidata="Q1817033" url="?curid=693301" title="Lateral lemniscus">
<text>The lateral lemniscus is a tract of axons in the brainstem that carries information about sound from the cochlear nucleus to various brainstem nuclei and ultimately the contralateral inferior colliculus of the midbrain. Three distinct, primarily inhibitory, cellular groups are located interspersed within these fibers, and are thus named the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.

==Connections==
There are three small nuclei on each of the lateral lemnisci: 
* the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (INLL)
* the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL)
* the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL)

Fibers leaving these brainstem nuclei ascending to the inferior colliculus rejoin the lateral lemniscus. In that sense, this is not a &#x27;lemniscus&#x27; in the true sense of the word (second order, decussated sensory axons), as there is third (and out of the lateral superior olive, fourth) order information coming out of some of these brainstem nuclei.

The lateral lemniscus is located where the cochlear nuclei and the pontine reticular formation (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It is the main auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior colliculus (IC). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the contralateral LL via the ipsilateral and contralateral Dorsal Acoustic Stria.

The two lemnisci communicate via the commissural fibers of Probst.

==Nuclei of the lateral lemniscus==
The function of the complex of Nuclei of the lateral lemniscus is not known; however it has good temporal resolution compared to other cells higher than the cochlear nuclei and is sensitive to both timing and amplitude changes in sound. It is also involved in the acoustic startle reflex; the most likely region for this being the VNLL.

===DNLL===
The cells of the DNLL respond best to bilateral inputs, and have onset and complexity tuned sustained responses. The nucleus is primarily GABAergic, and projects bilaterally to the inferior colliculus, and contralaterally to the DNLL, with different populations of cells projecting to each IC.

In rat, the DNLL has a prominent columnar organization. Nearly all neurons are stained for GABA, especially in the central part of the nucleus, and the remaining GABA negative cells are interspersed with the positive, and often stain for glycine. Two populations of GABA+ cells are visible: larger, lightly stained cells that project to the contralateral IC, and smaller, darker stained cells that project ipsilaterally. GABAergic axon terminals form dense groups surrounded by GABA-lemniscal fibers throughout the nucleus, and synapse on both somata and in the neuropil. Glycinergic axon terminals, on the other hand, are more finely localized, with the majority of recipient neurons located laterally in the nucleus.

===INLL===
INLL also has little spontaneous activity and broad tuning curves. The temporal responses are significantly different from cells of the VNLL.

This structure is greatly hypertrophied in the rat, forming a prominent bulge on the surface of the brainstem. GAD, GABA, and Glycine staining reveals several distinct regions that are not evident in standard cytoarchitectural preparations. A modest number of GABA-stained neurons are arranged in small groups, generally in the center of the nucleus, whereas glycine-stained neurons are more common and widely dispersed, with regional concentrations in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral portions of the nucleus. Most GABA+ cells are gly+ as well.

===VNLL===
Sound in the contralateral ear leads to the strongest responses in the VNLL, which deals with some temporary processing. The VNLL may also be essential to the IC’s decoding of amplitude modulated sounds.

VNLL cells have little spontaneous activity, broad and moderately complex tuning curves; they have both phasic and tonic responses and are involved in temporal processing.

In rat, the VNLL is composed of two subdivisions, the ventral (columnar) and dorsal (non columnar) regions. The columnar region contains many glycine-positive (0 GABA+) neurons, whereas the dorsal region contains clusters of GABA+ neurons intermingled with gly+ cells, with some cells containing both.

==Inputs and outputs to nuclei==
The table below shows that each of the nuclei have a complicated arrangement of ipsilateral and contralateral afferent inputs and outputs:

<doc id="693305" wikidata="Q18645284" url="?curid=693305" title="Prochlorococcus">
<text>Prochlorococcus is a genus of very small (0.6 μm) marine cyanobacteria with an unusual pigmentation (chlorophyll &quot;a2&quot; and &quot;b2&quot;). These bacteria belong to the photosynthetic picoplankton and are probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; microbes are among the major primary producers in the ocean, responsible for a large percentage of the photosynthetic production of oxygen. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; strains, called ecotypes, have physiological differences enabling them to exploit different ecological niches. Analysis of the genome sequences of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; strains show that 1,273 genes are common to all strains, and the average genome size is about 2,000 genes. In contrast, eukaryotic algae have over 10,000 genes.

==Discovery==
Although there had been several earlier records of very small chlorophyll-&quot;b&quot;-containing cyanobacteria in the ocean, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; was discovered in 1986 by Sallie W. (Penny) Chisholm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Robert J. Olson of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and other collaborators in the Sargasso Sea using flow cytometry. Chisholm was awarded the Crafoord Prize in 2019 for the discovery. The first culture of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; was isolated in the Sargasso Sea in 1988 (strain SS120) and shortly another strain was obtained from the Mediterranean Sea (strain MED). The name &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; originated from the fact it was originally assumed that &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; was related to &quot;Prochloron&quot; and other chlorophyll-&quot;b&quot;-containing bacteria, called prochlorophytes, but it is now known that prochlorophytes form several separate phylogenetic groups within the cyanobacteria subgroup of the bacteria domain. The only species within the genus described is &quot;Prochlorococcus marinus&quot;, although two subspecies have been named for low-light and high-light adapted niche variations.

==Morphology==
Marine cyanobacteria are to date the smallest known photosynthetic organisms; &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is the smallest at just 0.5 to 0.7 micrometres in diameter. The coccoid shaped cells are non-motile and free-living. Their small size and large surface-area-to-volume ratio, gives them an advantage in nutrient-poor water. Still, it is assumed that &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; have a very small nutrient requirement. Moreover, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; have adapted to use sulfolipids instead of phospholipids in their membranes to survive in phosphate deprived environments. This adaptation allows them to avoid competition with heterotrophs that are dependent on phosphate for survival. Typically, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; divide once a day in the subsurface layer or oligotrophic waters.

==Distribution==
&quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is abundant in the euphotic zone of the world&#x27;s tropical oceans. It is possibly the most plentiful genus on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater may contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, the average yearly abundance is individuals (for comparison, that is approximately the number of atoms in a ton of gold). &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is ubiquitous between 40°N and 40°S and dominates in the oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) regions of the oceans. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is mostly found in a temperature range of 10–33 °C and some strains can grow at depths with low light (&lt;1% surface light). These strains are known as LL (Low Light) ecotypes, with strains that occupy shallower depths in the water column known as HL (High Light) ecotypes. Furthermore, &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; are more plentiful in the presence of heterotrophs that have catalase abilities. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; do not have mechanisms to degrade reactive oxygen species and rely on heterotrophs to protect them. The bacterium accounts for an estimated 13–48% of the global photosynthetic production of oxygen, and forms part of the base of the ocean food chain.

==Pigments==
&quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is closely related to &quot;Synechococcus,&quot; another abundant photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which contains the light-harvesting antennae phycobilisomes. However, &quot;Prochlorochoccus&quot; has evolved to use a unique light-harvesting complex, consisting predominantly of divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a2) and chlorophyll b (Chl b2) and lacking monovinyl chlorophylls and phycobilisomes. &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; is the only known wild-type oxygenic phototroph that does not contain Chl a as a major photosynthetic pigment, and is the only known prokaryote with α-carotene.

==Genome==
The genomes of several strains of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; have been sequenced. Twelve complete genomes have been sequenced which reveal physiologically and genetically distinct lineages of &quot;Prochlorococcus marinus&quot; that are 97% similar in the 16S rRNA gene. Research has shown that a massive genome reduction occurred during the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth, which was followed by population bottlenecks.

The high-light ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 basepairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, but the genome of the low-light type is much larger (2,410,873 base pairs, 2,275 genes).

==DNA recombination, repair and replication==

Marine &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; cyanobacteria have several genes that function in DNA recombination, repair and replication. These include the &quot;recBCD&quot; gene complex whose product, exonuclease V, functions in recombinational repair of DNA, and the &quot;umuCD&quot; gene complex whose product, DNA polymerase V, functions in error-prone DNA replication. These cyanobacteria also have the gene &quot;lexA&quot; that regulates an SOS response system, probably a system like the well-studied &quot;E. coli&quot; SOS system that is employed in the response to DNA damage.

==Ecology==
Ancestors of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; contributed to the production of early atmospheric oxygen. Despite &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; being one of the smallest types of marine phytoplankton in the world&#x27;s oceans, its substantial number make it responsible for a major part of the oceans&#x27;, world&#x27;s photosynthesis, and oxygen production. The size of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; (0.5 to 0.7 μm) and the adaptations of the various ecotypes allow the organism to grow abundantly in low nutrient waters such as the waters of the tropics and the subtropics (c. 40°N to 40°S); however, they can be found in higher latitudes as high up as 60° north but at fairly minimal concentrations and the bacteria&#x27;s distribution across the oceans suggest that the colder waters could be fatal. This wide range of latitude along with the bacteria&#x27;s ability to survive up to depths of 100 to 150 metres, i.e. the average depth of the mixing layer of the surface ocean, allows it to grow to enormous numbers, up to individuals worldwide. This enormous number makes the &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; play an important role in the global carbon cycle and oxygen production. Along with &quot;Synechococcus&quot; (another genus of cyanobacteria that co-occurs with &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;) these cyanobacteria are responsible for approximately 50% of marine carbon fixation, making it an important carbon sink via the biological carbon pump (i.e. the transfer of organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep via several biological, physical and chemical processes). The abundance, distribution and all other characteristics of the &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; make it a key organism in oligotrophic waters serving as an important primary producer to the open ocean food webs.

== Ecotypes ==
&quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; has different &quot;ecotypes&quot; occupying different niches and can vary by pigments, light requirements, nitrogen and phosphorus utilization, copper, and virus sensitivity. It is thought that &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; may occupy potentially 35 different ecotypes and sub-ecotypes within the worlds&#x27; oceans. They can be differentiated on the basis of the sequence of the ribosomal RNA gene. It has been broken down by NCBI Taxonomy into two different subspecies, Low-light Adapted (LL) or High-light Adapted (HL). There are six clades within each subspecies.

=== Low-light adapted ===
&quot;Prochlorococcus marinus&quot; subsp. &quot;marinus&quot; is associated with low-light adapted types. It is also further classified by sub-ecotypes LLI-LLVII, where LLII/III has not been yet phylogenetically uncoupled. LV species are found in highly iron scarce locations around the equator, and as a result, have lost several ferric proteins. The low-light adapted subspecies is otherwise known to have a higher ratio of chlorophyll b2 to chlorophyll a2, which aids in its ability to absorb blue light. Blue light is able to penetrate ocean waters deeper than the rest of the visible spectrum, and can reach depths of &gt;200 m, depending on the turbidity of the water. Their ability to photosynthesize at a depth where blue light penetrates allows them to inhabit depths between 80 and 200 m. Their genomes can range from 1,650,000 to 2,600,000 basepairs in size.

=== High-light adapted ===
&quot;Prochlorococcus marinus&quot; subsp. &quot;pastoris&quot; is associated with high-light adapted types. It can be further classified by sub-ecotypes HLI-HLVI. HLIII, like LV, is also located in an iron-limited environment near the equator, with similar ferric adaptations. The high-light adapted subspecies is otherwise known to have a low ratio of chlorophyll b2 to chlorophyll a2. High-light adapted strains inhabit depths between 25 and 100 m. Their genomes can range from 1,640,000 to 1,800,000 basepairs in size.

== Metabolism ==
Most cyanobacterium are known to have an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In this process, 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase (2OGDC) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), replace the enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-OGDH). Normally, when this enzyme complex joins with NADP+, it can be converted to succinate from 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). This pathway is non-functional in &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot;, as succinate dehydrogenase has been lost evolutionarily to conserve energy that may have otherwise been lost to phosphate metabolism.

<text>A foundation (also referred to as a charitable foundation) is a type of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that usually provides funding and support to other charitable organizations through grants, while also potentially participating directly in charitable activities. Foundations encompass public charitable foundations, like community foundations, and private foundations, which are often endowed by an individual or family. Nevertheless, the term &quot;foundation&quot; might also be adopted by organizations not primarily engaged in public grantmaking.

==Description==
Legal entities existing under the status of &quot;foundations&quot; have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. Nevertheless, there are some common structural elements.
* Legal requirements followed for establishment
* Purpose of the foundation
* Economic activity
* Supervision and management provisions
* Accountability and auditing provisions
* Provisions for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation
* Provisions for the dissolution of the entity
* Tax status of corporate and private donors
* Tax status of the foundation

Some of the above must be, in most jurisdictions, expressed in the document of establishment. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.

==Europe==
There is no commonly accepted legal definition across Europe for a foundation. There was a proposal for a European Foundation Statute, a legal form that would create a legal definition recognised across all EU Member States. However, this proposal was withdrawn in 2015 following its failure to pass through COREPER 1.

==Foundations in civil law==
The term &quot;foundation&quot;, in general, is used to describe a distinct legal entity. Foundations as legal structures (legal entities) and/or legal persons (legal personality) may have a diversity of forms and may follow varying regulations depending on the jurisdiction where they are created. Foundations are often set up for charitable purposes, family patrimony and collective purposes which can include education or research.

In some jurisdictions, a foundation may acquire its legal personality when it is entered in a public registry, while in other countries a foundation may acquire legal personality by the mere action of creation through a required document. Unlike a company, foundations have no shareholders, though they may have a board, an assembly and voting members. A foundation may hold assets in its own name for the purposes set out in its constitutive documents, and its administration and operation are carried out in accordance with its statutes or articles of association rather than fiduciary principles. The foundation has a distinct patrimony independent of its founder.

===Finland===
In Finland, foundations (, ) are regulated by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office and have the four following characteristics:

* They are set up to manage property donated for a particular purpose.
* This purpose is determined when establishing the foundation.
* Foundations have neither owners, shareholders, nor members.
* A board of trustees ensures that the foundation operates appropriately, and is responsible for ensuring that the investments by the foundation are secure and profitable.

Foundations are considered legal persons in Finland. The Foundations Act in 2015 dramatically updated the laws regarding foundations.

===France===
There are not many foundations in comparison to the rest of Europe. In practice public administration requires at least €1 million necessary. State representatives have a mandatory seat in the board.

===Germany===
German regulations allow the creation of any foundation for public or private purposes in keeping with the concept of a &quot;gemeinwohlkonforme Allzweckstiftung&quot; (&quot;general-purpose foundation compatible with the common good&quot;). A foundation should not have commercial activities as its main purpose, but they are permitted if they serve the main purpose of the foundation. There is no minimum starting capital, although in practice at least €50,000 is considered necessary.

A German foundation can either be charitable or serve a private interest. Charitable foundations enjoy tax exemptions. If they engage in commercial activities, only the commercially active part of the entity is taxed. A family foundation serving private interests is taxed like any other legal entity. There is no central register for German foundations.

Only charitable foundations are subject to supervision by state authorities. Family foundations are not supervised after establishment. All forms of foundations can be dissolved, however, if they pursue anti-constitutional aims. Foundations are supervised by local authorities within each state (Bundesland) because each state has exclusive legislative power over the laws governing foundations.

In contrast to many other countries, German law allows a tax-sheltered charitable foundation to distribute up to one-third of its profit to the founder and his next of kin, if they are needy, or to maintain the founder&#x27;s grave. These benefits are subject to taxation.

, there are about 15,000 foundations in Germany, about 85% of them charitable foundations. More than 250 charitable German foundations have existed for more than 500 years; the oldest dates back to 1509. There are also large German corporations owned by foundations, including Bertelsmann, Bosch, Carl Zeiss AG and Lidl. Foundations are the main providers of private scholarships to German students.

===Italy===
In Italy, a foundation is a private non-profit and autonomous organization, its assets must be dedicated to a purpose established by the founder. The founder cannot receive any benefits from the foundation or have reverted the initial assets. The private foundations or civil code foundations are under the section about non commercial entities of the first book of the Civil Code of Law of 1942. Article 16 CC establishes that the foundation&#x27;s statutes must contain its name, purpose, assets, domicile, administrative organs and regulations, and how the grants will be distributed. The founder must write a declaration of intention including a purpose and endow assets for such purpose. This document can be in the form of a notarized deed or a will. To obtain legal personality, the foundation must enroll in the legal register of each prefettura (local authority) or some cases the regional authority. There are several nuances in requirements according to each foundation&#x27;s purpose and area of activity.

===Netherlands===

Non-profit foundations are termed as &quot;stichting&quot; in the Netherlands which are regulated by Dutch law.

===Norway===
===Portugal===
A foundation (&quot;Fundação&quot;) in Portugal is regulated by Law 150/2015, with the exception of religious foundations, which are regulated by the Religious Freedom Law. Foundations may be private, wholly public (created and managed exclusively by public bodies), or public but with private management (created by public entities and optionally also private entities, but whose management is dominated by private entities). Foundations may only be operational after being recognized by the Prime Minister of Portugal.

Foundations must designate and pursue at least one of twenty-five public benefit goals defined by law. They must also have enough assets to pursue those goals. They may not benefit the founders or any other restricted group, but the general public.

Portuguese foundations may voluntarily associate themselves via the Portuguese Foundation Centre (&quot;CPF – Centro Português de Fundações&quot;), that was founded in 1993 by the Eng. António de Almeida Foundation, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the Oriente Foundation.

===Spain===
Foundations in Spain are organizations founded with the purpose of not seeking profit and serving the general needs of the public. Such foundations may be founded by private individuals or by the public. These foundations have an independent legal personality separate from their founders. Foundations serve the general needs of the public with a patrimony that funds public services and may not be distributed to the founders&#x27; benefit.

===Sweden===
A foundation in Sweden () is a legal entity without an owner. It is formed by a letter of donation from a founder donating funds or assets to be administered for a specific purpose. When the purpose is for the public benefit, a foundation may enjoy favorable tax treatment. A foundation may have diverse purposes, including but not limited to public benefit, humanitarian or cultural purposes, religious, collective, familiar, or the simple passive administration of funds. Normally, the supervision of a foundation is done by the county government where the foundation has its domicile, however, large foundations must be registered by the county administrative board (CAB), which must also supervise the administration of the foundation. The main legal instruments governing foundations in Sweden are the Foundation Act (1994:1220) and the Regulation for Foundations (1995:1280).

===Switzerland===
A foundation needs to be registered with the company register.

==Foundations in common law==
===Canada===
Under Canadian law, registered charities may be designated as charitable organizations, public foundations, or private foundations. The designation depends on factors such as the charity&#x27;s structure, funding sources, and mode of operation. Charities receive notification of their designation from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) upon registration. A charity with only one director or trustee is automatically designated as a private foundation. To be designated as a charitable organization or public foundation, more than half of the directors, trustees, or officials must be at arm&#x27;s length. The CRA applies specific criteria to determine the designation, including the charity&#x27;s purposes, activities, income allocation, and relationships with officials and donors.

===Ireland===
The law does not prescribe any particular form for a foundation in Ireland. Most commonly, foundations are companies limited by guarantees or trusts. A foundation can obtain a charity registration number from the Revenue Commissioners for obtaining tax relief as far as they can be considered under the law on charity, however, charitable status does not exist in Ireland. The definition usually applied is that from the Pemsel Case of English jurisprudence (1891) and the Irish Income Tax Act 1967.
Trusts have no legal personality and companies acquire their legal status through the Company law and the required documents of incorporation. Foundations are not required to register with any public authority.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the word &quot;foundation&quot; is sometimes used in the title of a charity, as in the British Heart Foundation and the Fairtrade Foundation. Despite this, the term is not generally used in English law, and (unlike in civil law systems) the term has no precise meaning. Instead, the concept of charitable trust is in use (for example, the Wellcome Trust).

The States of Jersey are considering introducing civil law type foundations into its law. A consultation paper presenting a general discussion on foundations was brought forth to the Jersey government concerning this possibility. It was adopted by the states of Jersey on 22 October 2008 through the Foundations (Jersey) Law 200.

===United States===
In the United States, many philanthropic and charitable organizations (such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation) are considered to be foundations. However, the Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between private foundations (usually endowed by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations or other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). While they offer donors more control over their charitable giving, private foundations have more restrictions and fewer tax benefits than public charities.

==International networks==
At an international level there are a series of networks and associations of foundations, among them Council on Foundations, EFC (European Foundation Centre), WINGS (Worldwide Initiatives for Grantmaker Support). Those organization also have a role in supporting research on foundations.

<text>Horrorcore (also called horror hip hop, horror rap, death hip hop, death rap, or murder rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music based on horror-themed and often darkly transgressive lyrical content and imagery. Its origins derived from certain hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap artists, such as the Geto Boys, who began to incorporate supernatural, the occult, and psychological horror themes into their lyrics. Other early originators and influences on the genre include Gravediggaz, Flatlinerz, Three 6 Mafia, Brotha Lynch Hung, and Kool Keith.

Unlike most hardcore hip hop and gangster rap artists, horrorcore artists often push the violent content and imagery in their lyrics beyond the realm of realistic urban violence, to the point where the violent lyrics become gruesome, ghoulish, unsettling, or inspired by slasher films or splatter films. While exaggerated violence and the supernatural are common in horrorcore, the genre also frequently presents more realistic yet still disturbing portrayals of mental illness and drug abuse. Some horrorcore artists eschew supernatural themes or exaggerated violence in favor of more subtle and dark psychological horror imagery and lyrics.

Horrorcore has incited controversy, with some members of the law enforcement community asserting that the genre incites crime. Fans and artists have been blamed for numerous high-profile instances of violent criminal activity, including the Columbine High School massacre, the Farmville murders, murders of law enforcement officers, and gang activity.

==Characteristics==

Horrorcore defines a style of hip hop music that focuses primarily on dark, violent, gothic, transgressive, macabre and/or horror-influenced topics such as death, psychosis, psychological horror, mental illness, satanism, self-harm, cannibalism, mutilation, suicide, murder, torture, drug abuse, and supernatural or occult themes. The lyrics are often inspired by horror movies and are performed over moody, hardcore beats. According to rapper Mars, &quot;If you take Stephen King or Wes Craven and you throw them on a rap beat, that&#x27;s who I am&quot;. Horrorcore was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1995 as a &quot;blend of hardcore rap and bloodthirsty metal&quot;. The lyrical content of horrorcore is sometimes described as being similar to that of death metal, and some have referred to the genre as &quot;death rap&quot;. Horrorcore artists often feature dark imagery in their music videos and base musical elements of songs upon horror film scores.

==History==
===Origins===
&quot;LA Weekly&quot; listed Jimmy Spicer&#x27;s 1980 single &quot;Adventures of Super Rhyme&quot; as the first example of &quot;proto-horrorcore&quot;, due to a lengthy segment of the song in which Spicer recounts his experience of meeting Dracula. The group Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde specialized in horror-themed music. Dana Dane&#x27;s song &quot;Nightmares&quot; related a frightening narrative.

Since 1986, Ganxsta N.I.P. has performed horror-themed lyrics that he has described as &quot;Psycho Rap&quot;, but he was not commonly considered to be horrorcore until the term came into mainstream prominence. Ganxsta N.I.P. has written lyrics for other groups, including Geto Boys, who were also an influence on the early horrorcore sound.

In 1988, DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince released &quot;A Nightmare on My Street&quot;, which described an encounter with Freddy Krueger, and the Fat Boys recorded the similarly-themed &quot;Are You Ready for Freddy&quot; for the film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; and its soundtrack. 1988 is also the year Insane Poetry (at the time called His Majesti) released &quot;Armed &amp; Dangerous&quot;, followed by their debut single as Insane Poetry, &quot;Twelve Strokes Till Midnight&quot;, one of the first examples of music specifically made to be horrorcore. The following year saw the release of &quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot;, the debut album of Detroit-based rapper Esham, who would become particularly influential on Midwest horrorcore (though he rejects the term, preferring &quot;acid rap&quot;). 

Although Kool Keith claimed to have &quot;invented horrorcore&quot;, the first use of the term appeared on the group KMC&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Three Men With the Power of Ten&quot;. Nonetheless, Kool Keith brought significant attention to horror-influenced hip hop with his lyrical content as a part of the Ultramagnetic MC&#x27;s and his 1996 debut solo album &quot;Dr. Octagonecologyst&quot;.

In 2024, writers at Complex described Nas&#x27; 1994, debut studio album &quot;Illmatic&quot; as &quot;shocking, borderline horrorcore (before horrorcore was a genre)&quot;. The album showcased Nas&#x27;s early &#x27;90s style of rap and was credited with generating significant hype for the MC.

===Rise in the hip hop genre===
The Geto Boys&#x27; debut album, &quot;Making Trouble&quot;, contained the dark and violent horror-influenced track &quot;Assassins&quot;, which was cited by Joseph Bruce (Violent J of the horrorcore group Insane Clown Posse) in his book &quot;Behind the Paint&quot; as the first recorded horrorcore song. He writes that the Geto Boys continued to pioneer the style with their second release, &quot;Grip It! On That Other Level&quot;, with songs such as &quot;Mind of a Lunatic&quot; and &quot;Trigga-Happy Nigga&quot;. The Geto Boys&#x27; 1991 album, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped&quot;, was also influential on the horrorcore genre and contained themes of paranoia, depression, and psychological horror, especially in the track &quot;Chuckie&quot;, and &quot;Mind Playing Tricks on Me&quot;.

While rappers in the underground scene continued to release horrorcore music, including Big L, Insane Poetry, and Insane Clown Posse, the mid-1990s brought an attempted mainstream crossover of the genre.

According to the book &quot;Icons of Hip Hop&quot;, horrorcore gained mainstream prominence in 1994 with the release of Flatlinerz&#x27; &quot;U.S.A. (Under Satan&#x27;s Authority)&quot; and Gravediggaz&#x27; &quot;6 Feet Deep&quot; (released overseas as &quot;Niggamortis&quot;). The Flatlinerz and Gravediggaz, along with the Geto Boys, Insane Clown Posse and Kool Keith, remain the most important artists in the development of horrorcore as a specific genre.

In 1995, an independent horror film called &quot;The Fear&quot; was released with a soundtrack consisting entirely of horrorcore songs, including Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s biggest radio hit, &quot;Dead Body Man&quot; and a title track (&quot;The Fear (Morty&#x27;s Theme)&quot;) by Esham. 1995 also saw the release of Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s debut album &quot;Mystic Stylez&quot;, which touched on heavy drug use, ritualistic sex, mass murder, torture, and Luciferianism. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony&#x27;s &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;, released in the same year, contains tales of the occult throughout, specifically on songs such as &quot;Mr. Ouija 2&quot;, &quot;Mo&#x27; Murda&quot;, &quot;East 1999&quot;, and &quot;Da Introduction&quot;. Tension would soon rise between Bone Thugs and Three 6 over their presumed similarities in style and use of dark imagery.

In 2009, dark music-themed website Fangoria named Tech N9ne&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Anghellic&quot; as an iconic and influential album to the genre, the artist, and hip-hop as a whole.

Horrorcore is generally not popular with mainstream audiences, though in some cities, like Detroit, it is the dominant style of hip-hop, with Detroit-based performers such as Insane Clown Posse and Eminem, as well as Twiztid, having been commercially successful throughout the US. Horrorcore has thrived in Internet culture. Every Halloween since 2003, horrorcore artists worldwide have gotten together online and release a free compilation titled &quot;Devilz Nite&quot;. According to the January 2004 BBC documentary &quot;Underground USA&quot;, the subgenre &quot;has a massive following across the US&quot; and &quot;is spreading to Europe&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2007 referred to it as a short-lived trend that generated &quot;more shlock than shock&quot;.

=== Present-day horrorcore ===

In 2019, experimental trio clipping. released &quot;There Existed an Addiction to Blood&quot;, described as a &quot;transmutation of horrorcore&quot;. GORE STREET (AKA: BODIES ON GORE STREET) is a more recent horrorcore collective, being formed in 2023, that mixes scream rap with violent imagery and horrorcore. With notable members Craig Scissorhands, rejectedreyna, and YAUX.

==Controversy==

In September 1996, Joseph Edward &quot;Bubba&quot; Gallegos, an 18-year-old from Bayfield, Colorado, killed his roommates after ingesting methamphetamine and listening repeatedly to horrorcore rapper Brotha Lynch Hung&#x27;s song &quot;Locc 2 da Brain&quot;. Brotha Lynch Hung is considered a horrorcore pioneer and even created his own horrorcore sub-category called &quot;Ripgut&quot; which is known for even more graphic lyrics dealing with hardcore gore, torture, and cannibalism. After attempting to kill his ex-girlfriend and taking two other students hostage, Gallegos was in turn killed by police. Gallegos was said to be a massive fan of Brotha Lynch Hung and his minister suggested that the music played a role in the killings, although he provided no evidence to back up that claim. Similar claims have been made about other violent acts and music, although there is &quot;wide disagreement among experts over what effect--if any--music with violent content has on listeners&quot;.

In 1999, horrorcore group Insane Clown Posse (ICP) was considered a potential influence on school shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ICP responded that if the shooters had been &quot;Juggalos&quot; (fans of ICP), they would have &quot;gotten the whole damn school&quot;. However, Brooks Brown, the best friend of Dylan Klebold and a friend of both the shooters, was a Juggalo and had introduced Klebold to Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s music.

Some police departments in the United States claim that Juggalo gangs have been linked to violent crimes. Arizona Department of Public Safety Detective Michelle Vasey has expressed concern at what she describes as the Juggalos&#x27; high potential for violence, stating, &quot;The weapons, they prefer, obviously, hatchets ... We&#x27;ve got battle-axes, we&#x27;ve got machetes, anything that can make the most violent, gruesome wound&quot;, and, &quot;Some of the homicides we&#x27;re seeing with these guys are pretty nasty, gruesome, disgusting homicides, where they don&#x27;t care who&#x27;s around, what&#x27;s around, they&#x27;re just out to kill anybody&quot;. A 2017 Denver Police Department guide claimed that even Juggalos who are not affiliated with a gang are prone to commit &quot;murder, shootings, kidnapping, rape, necrophilia, cannibalism, assault, and arson&quot;, and that &quot;such acts give a Juggalo a sense of pride and street credit amongst peers&quot;, although it acknowledged that the author had not &quot;been able to find a significant source of collected data on the Juggalos&quot; to substantiate those claims. Allegedly horrorcore-related criminal activity has, in rare cases, even included ad-hoc domestic terrorism, such as when a Juggalo-led terrorist cell calling itself the &quot;Black Snake Militia&quot; attempted to raid a National Guard armory in 2012.

<text>Dismemberment is the act of completely disconnecting and/or removing the limbs from a living or dead being. It has been practiced upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with regicide, but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to surgical amputation of limbs, dismemberment is often fatal. In criminology, a distinction is made between offensive dismemberment, in which dismemberment is the primary objective of the dismemberer, and defensive dismemberment, in which the motivation is to destroy evidence. 

In 2019, American psychiatrists and medical professionals Michael H. Stone, Gary Brucato, and Ann Burgess proposed formal criteria by which &quot;dismemberment&quot; might be systematically distinguished from the act of mutilation, as these terms are commonly used interchangeably. They suggested that dismemberment involves &quot;the entire removal, by any means, of a large section of the body of a living or dead person, specifically, the head (also termed decapitation), arms, hands, torso, pelvic area, legs, or feet&quot;. Mutilation, by contrast, involves &quot;the removal or irreparable disfigurement, by any means, of some smaller portion of one of those larger sections of a living or dead person. The latter would include castration (removal of the testes), disembowelment (removal of internal organs), and flaying (removal of the skin).&quot; According to these parameters, removing a whole hand would constitute dismemberment, while removing or damaging a finger would be mutilation; decapitation of a full head would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a part of the face would be mutilation; and removing a whole torso would be dismemberment, while removing or damaging a breast or the organs contained within the torso would be mutilation.

==History==

===Cutting apart===

====Slicing to pieces by elephant====
Particularly in South Asia, execution by trained elephants was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta, visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:

====Quartering procedure in the Holy Roman Empire====

In the Holy Roman Empire emperor Charles V&#x27;s 1532 Constitutio Criminalis Carolina specifies how &quot;every&quot; dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:

Thus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of &quot;cutting&quot;, rather than dismemberment through &quot;ripping&quot; the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.

The fate of Wilhelm von Grumbach in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach&#x27;s face with the words: &quot;von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!&quot; Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach&#x27;s body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness stated that &quot;after&quot; his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for &quot;quite some time&quot;.

One example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs broken on the wheel, and finally, while still alive, quartered.

====Fabled Turkish execution method====
In the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic &quot;Turkish&quot; execution method, where first the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. William Lithgow presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:

George Sandys, however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:

====Shekkeh in Persia====
In 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called &quot;shekkeh&quot; is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the East India Company Robert Binning describes it as follows:

====Mughal Empire/Mughal–Sikh Wars====
Sikh martyr Bhai Mani Singh was dismembered on the orders of Zakaria Khan, the Mughal Subahdar of Lahore after failing to pay tribute.

====Korea====
Dismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of high treason in the Korean kingdom of the Joseon Dynasty. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.

====China====
The Five Punishments is a Chinese variation invented during the Qin dynasty. During the Tang dynasty (AD 618–907), truncation of the body at the waist by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant. That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220), no fewer than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.

Lingchi was a form of torture and execution used from the 10th century until the early 20th century to punish heinous crimes such as treason. Often translated as &quot;slow slicing&quot; or &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;, a knife was used to remove portions of the body until death.

====Current use====
Dismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or torture, though amputation is still carried out in countries that practice Sharia law.

===Tearing apart===
Dismemberment was carried out in the Medieval and Early Modern era and could be effected, for example, by tying a person&#x27;s limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions. Depending on the forces supplied by the horses or other entities, joints of the hips and shoulders were quickly dislocated, but ultimate severing of the tendons and ligaments in order to fully dismember the limbs would sometimes require assistance with cuts from a blade. 

====By four horses====
Also referred to as &quot;disruption&quot;, dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned&#x27;s arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of François Ravaillac in 1610, Michał Piekarski in 1620, and Robert-François Damiens in 1757. Ravaillac&#x27;s extended torture and execution has been described like this:

In the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness Giacomo Casanova could relate:

As late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the Peruvian rebel leader Túpac Amaru II by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied 

====By five horses====
&quot;Chēliè&quot; () was dismemberment by tying the limbs and head to five carts led by horses or oxen, which would pull the body apart. It was a form of torture and execution used in ancient China from the Warring States period until the Tang Dynasty.

====Fate of Queen Brunhilda====
Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia, executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a dragging death. The Liber Historiae Francorum, an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:

The story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a &quot;single&quot; horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: &quot;Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death&quot;. The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century &quot;Life of St. Columban&quot; by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: &quot;but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly&quot;.

The storyline of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently &quot;dragged&quot; to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.

====Torn apart by four ships====
According to Olfert Dapper, a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the Barbary corsairs was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.

====Torn apart by two trees====
Roman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor Aurelian (r. AD 270–275), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two. Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor Valens in AD 366, the usurper Procopius met the same fate.

After the defeat of Darius III by Alexander the Great, the Persian empire was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, Bessus, claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BC, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus&#x27; death is disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:

The method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat James Justinian Morier travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then-prevailing criminal justice:

====Torn apart by stones====
An obscure Christian martyr Severianus was, about the year AD 300, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.

====A Christian martyr withstands being torn apart====
During the reign of the Roman Emperor Diocletian a Christian named Shamuna withstood being torn apart in the following manner:

Some time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.

<text>The Washita River () is a river in the U.S. states of Texas and Oklahoma. The river is long and terminates at its confluence with the Red River, which is now part of Lake Texoma () on the TexasOklahoma border.

==Geography==
The Washita River forms in eastern Roberts County, Texas (), near the town of Miami in the Texas Panhandle. The river crosses Hemphill County, Texas and enters Oklahoma in Roger Mills County. It cuts through the Oklahoma counties of Roger Mills, Custer, Washita, Caddo, Grady, Garvin, Murray, Carter, and Johnston before emptying into Lake Texoma, which is the modern border between Bryan County and Marshall County.

The river bisects the heart of the Anadarko Basin, the fifth-largest natural gas formation area in the United States. When the river reaches the Arbuckle Mountains, it drops as it cuts through Big Canyon, a limestone gorge deep.

The Washita&#x27;s river bed is made up of unstable mud and sand, and its banks are composed of steeply incised and erosive red earth. This makes it one of the most silt-laden streams in North America.
===Tributaries===
Along its path, the Foss Dam impounds the Washita River in Custer County to create the Foss Reservoir. Several reservoirs in the Washita River valley hold the waters of small tributaries, including Fort Cobb Lake, Lake Chickasha, and Arbuckle Reservoir.
==History==
French explorers encountered the Washita River in the early 18th century while traveling upstream on the Red River and thought it was the same stream described by friendly Choctaw tribesmen as the Ouachita River. They soon found that it appeared very different from descriptions of the Ouachita, and named it the &quot;Faux Ouachita&quot; (False Ouachita). The name was later referred to by English-speaking American settlers as False Washita. After the American Civil War, Americans referred to the river as the Washita.

In 1842, General and future President Zachary Taylor established Fort Washita near the lower end of the river to protect resettled citizens of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, who had been removed from the Southeastern United States, from the Plains Indians inhabiting the area. The fort was about above the confluence of the Washita and Red rivers.

During the later Indian Wars, the Battle of Washita River (also known as the Washita River Massacre) occurred at dawn on November 27, 1868. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer’s 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Black Kettle’s Cheyenne village on the Washita River near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, killing many inhabitants.

Capt. Wyllys Lyman&#x27;s wagon train was besieged by Indians near the Washita in Hemphill County on September 9–14, 1874.

<text>Dave is a 1993 American political comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman, written by Gary Ross, and starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Laura Linney, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin, and Ben Kingsley appear in supporting roles. &quot;Dave&quot; was a box office success, and was met with critical acclaim.

==Plot==
Dave Kovic runs a temporary employment agency in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and, as a side job, capitalizes on his remarkable resemblance to President Bill Mitchell by comically impersonating him at events. Secret Service agent Duane Stevenson recruits him to impersonate Mitchell after a speech, ostensibly as a security precaution, but actually to allow Mitchell to meet Randi, a White House staffer with whom he is having an affair.

Dave&#x27;s appearance goes well, but Mitchell suffers a major stroke while having sex with Randi. His Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, is inspired to ask Dave to continue in his role. Bob&#x27;s scheme is to force Vice President Gary Nance to resign by embroiling him in a savings and loan scandal; then Dave, acting as Mitchell, will appoint Bob vice president; then Dave will fake a more serious stroke and Bob will become president. Communications Director Alan Reed is initially hesitant, but eventually acquiesces and tells the press corps the stroke was minor. Claiming that Nance is mentally unstable, Bob and Alan convince Dave he must continue impersonating Mitchell for the good of the country. Nance is sent on a goodwill tour of Africa.

Dave&#x27;s charm and enthusiasm improves Mitchell&#x27;s image and popularity. First Lady Ellen Mitchell, who has been estranged from her husband for years, initially suspects nothing and treats Dave with contempt on the few occasions they see each other. When she sees Dave&#x27;s empathy towards a shy boy at a homeless shelter for which she is a staunch advocate, she begins to soften towards him. Her fury returns, though, after Bob forges Mitchell&#x27;s signature on the veto of a bill that included funding for the shelter. Dave, after consulting his accountant friend Murray Blum, works with the Cabinet to restore the funding. A furious Bob threatens to destroy Dave, but Alan vows to expose their scheme if he does and all three of them will end up in jail.

Ellen, having witnessed Dave&#x27;s considerable efforts to save the shelter, tricks him into admitting he&#x27;s an impostor and asks to see her husband. Dave has Duane escort them to a secret hospital room beneath the White House, where Mitchell remains in a coma. They are told he won&#x27;t recover. They both resolve to leave the White House, but after spending a night out alone together, they begin to fall in love. Ellen tells Dave she&#x27;s gone along with the charade of a happy marriage because she thought that as First Lady, she could help people. Dave tells her he wishes he could.

The next day, Dave, still as Mitchell, calls a press conference, making Bob furious that Dave is no longer obeying him. Dave fires Bob, who in turn tries to fire him, but Dave dares Bob to tell the press about the switch. At the press conference, Dave announces a monumental plan to provide a job to every American who wants one.

Nance returns from Africa and confronts Dave for trying to frame him for crimes of which Bob and the real Mitchell are actually guilty. In retaliation against Dave, Bob reveals evidence implicating Mitchell in the scandal, which Alan admits is true. Despite talk of impeachment, Dave refuses to back off his jobs plan, while Bob quietly begins to garner support for a presidential run.

During a joint session of Congress, Dave admits that Bob&#x27;s allegations are true and produces proof, provided by Alan, that shows that Bob was also involved, and that Nance is innocent. After Dave apologizes to Nance and the country, he fakes another stroke; switching places with Mitchell, he resumes his previous life. The hospital pronounces the &quot;second&quot; stroke as major, and Mitchell continues to lie in a coma for five more months before dying. As acting president and then president, Nance backs the jobs plan, which becomes law. Bob and several Mitchell administration officials are indicted, while Alan continues working in the White House.

Dave runs for the D.C. city council with the help of Murray and his employment agency staff. Dave is surprised one day when Ellen visits. He escorts her into his office, where they share their first kiss. Dave closes the shades to give them privacy and Duane, wearing one of Dave&#x27;s campaign buttons, steps in front of the door.

==Cast==
===Cameos===
;Politicians
;Media personalities
Senators Al D&#x27;Amato, Lloyd Bentsen, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan were scheduled to make cameo appearances in the film but withdrew in protest of Warner Records&#x27;s decision to release Body Count&#x27;s song &quot;Cop Killer.&quot; NBC also prohibited Andrea Mitchell from making a planned appearance in the film.

==Production==
Producer Lauren Shuler Donner and screenwriter Gary Ross had known each other since taking a Stella Adler class in the 1970s, and in 1988 Ross told Shuler Donner his idea for &quot;Dave&quot;. Ross wrote the script while working on the Michael Dukakis presidential campaign during the 1988 election, and he was inspired by the Iran-contra affair. Ross also received advice from First Lady Barbara Bush&#x27;s press secretary Anna Perez. Shuler Donner approved it, but her employer Walt Disney Productions refused to release it while a conservative such as Ronald Reagan or George H. W. Bush held the presidency. Warner Bros. bought the project with the intent to have it directed by Shuler Donner&#x27;s husband Richard Donner, but he decided against continuing with the project in 1990. Production was delayed by three years to wait for Shuler Donner to be released from her contract with Disney and for director Ivan Reitman to become available.

According to Reitman, Warner Bros. wanted a box office star to portray the lead role and that one executive even suggested Arnold Schwarzenegger to play the part. Michael Keaton was briefly cast in the role but had to drop out. Both Warren Beatty and Kevin Costner were also considered for the role. In fact, it was Beatty who brought &quot;Dave&quot; to Reitman&#x27;s attention. Kevin Kline almost turned down the role, because he thought he would be playing the same character he played in &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;.

Nevertheless, Kline was hired to play the protagonist, as Reitman considered him to have a presidential look and be an actor &quot;who was both dramatically strong and was light on his feet,&quot; as Kline would not only be playing a double role, but the film was a comedy that dealt with very serious subject matter. Reitman then called Sigourney Weaver, with whom he had worked in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, for the First Lady role. Ross was present for production, as he was interested in starting a directing career as well.

Filming began on August 13, 1992, in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. White House interior sets were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank while exterior scenes were filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, California. The film&#x27;s Oval Office set was constructed based on a replica at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and would be reused more than 25 times, for television shows and films such as &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot; and &quot;Absolute Power&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Dave&quot; debuted at number 2 at the US box office, behind &quot;&quot;. It reached number 1 in its second weekend. In total, &quot;Dave&quot; made $63.3 million in the United States and Canada and $28.5 million internationally for a worldwide total of $91.8 million.

===Critical response===

&quot;Dave&quot; was met with critical acclaim. It has a 95% approval rate and an average score of 7.6 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 62 reviews. The critic&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Ivan Reitman&#x27;s refreshingly earnest political comedy benefits from an understated, charming script and a breezy performance by Kevin Kline.&quot; It has a score of 76 out of 100 Metacritic, based on 30 reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four. Ebert praised the film&#x27;s acting and wrote, &quot;&quot;Dave&quot; takes that old plot about an ordinary person who is suddenly thrust into a position of power, and finds a fresh way to tell it. [...] When I first heard this story line, I imagined that &quot;Dave&quot; would be completely predictable. I was wrong. The movie is more proof that it isn&#x27;t what you do, it&#x27;s how you do it: Ivan Reitman&#x27;s direction and Gary Ross&#x27;s screenplay use intelligence and warmhearted sentiment to make &quot;Dave&quot; into wonderful lighthearted entertainment. [...] Both Kline and Weaver are good at playing characters of considerable intelligence, and that&#x27;s the case here. The movie may be built on subtle variations of the Idiot Plot, in which the characters skillfully avoid tripping over obvious conclusions, but they bring such particular qualities to their characters that we almost believe them.&quot;

Then-President Bill Clinton approved of the film, and gave Ross a framed script, which Clinton had autographed, writing that it was a &quot;funny, often accurate lampooning of politics.&quot; Clinton also gave Ross a picture of himself holding a &quot;Dave&quot; mug.

===Accolades===
==Other media==
===Musical===
A musical based on the movie opened at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in July 2018. The book is written by Thomas Meehan and Nell Benjamin, with music by Tom Kitt. The production is directed by Tina Landau and stars Drew Gehling as Dave and Douglas Sills as Chief of Staff Bob Alexander.

<doc id="693334" wikidata="Q191360" url="?curid=693334" title="Foundation (engineering)">
<text>In engineering, a foundation is the element of a structure which connects it to the ground or more rarely, water (as with floating structures), transferring loads from the structure to the ground. Foundations are generally considered either shallow or deep. Foundation engineering is the application of soil mechanics and rock mechanics (geotechnical engineering) in the design of foundation elements of structures.

==Purpose==

Foundations provide the structure&#x27;s stability from the ground:
* To distribute the weight of the structure over a large area in order to avoid overloading the underlying soil (possibly causing unequal settlement). 
* To anchor the structure against natural forces including earthquakes, floods, droughts, frost heaves, tornadoes and wind.
* To provide a level surface for construction.
* To anchor the structure deeply into the ground, increasing its stability and preventing overloading.
* To prevent lateral movements of the supported structure (in some cases).

==Requirements of a good foundation==
The design and the construction of a well-performing foundation must possess some basic requirements:
* The design and the construction of the foundation is done such that it can sustain as well as transmit the dead and the imposed loads to the soil. This transfer has to be carried out without resulting in any form of settlement that can cause stability issues for the structure.
*Differential settlements can be avoided by having a rigid base for the foundation. These issues are more pronounced in areas where the superimposed loads are not uniform in nature.
*Based on the soil and area it is recommended to have a deeper foundation so that it can guard any form of damage or distress. These are mainly caused due to the problem of shrinkage and swelling because of temperature changes.
*The location of the foundation chosen must be an area that is not affected or influenced by future works or factors.

==Historic types==
===Earthfast or post in ground construction===
Buildings and structures have a long history of being built with wood in contact with the ground. Post in ground construction may technically have no foundation. Timber pilings were used on soft or wet ground even below stone or masonry walls. In marine construction and bridge building a crisscross of timbers or steel beams in concrete is called grillage.

===Padstones===
Perhaps the simplest foundation is the padstone, a single stone which both spreads the weight on the ground and raises the timber off the ground. Staddle stones are a specific type of padstone.

===Stone foundations===
Dry stone and stones laid in mortar to build foundations are common in many parts of the world. Dry laid stone foundations may have been painted with mortar after construction. Sometimes the top, visible course of stone is hewn, quarried stones. Besides using mortar, stones can also be put in a gabion. One disadvantage is that if using regular steel rebars, the gabion would last much less long than when using mortar (due to rusting). Using weathering steel rebars could reduce this disadvantage somewhat.

===Rubble-trench foundations===

Rubble trench foundations are a shallow trench filled with rubble or stones. These foundations extend below the frost line and may have a drain pipe which helps groundwater drain away. They are suitable for soils with a capacity of more than 10 tonnes/m2 (2,000 pounds per square foot).

==Gallery of shallow foundation types==
==Modern types==
===Shallow foundations===
Often called &quot;footings&quot;, are usually embedded about a meter or so into soil. One common type is the spread footing which consists of strips or pads of concrete (or other materials) which extend below the frost line and transfer the weight from walls and columns to the soil or bedrock.

Another common type of shallow foundation is the slab-on-grade foundation where the weight of the structure is transferred to the soil through a concrete slab placed at the surface. Slab-on-grade foundations can be reinforced mat slabs, which range from 25 cm to several meters thick, depending on the size of the building, or post-tensioned slabs, which are typically at least 20 cm for houses, and thicker for heavier structures.

Another way to install ready-to-build foundations that is more environmentally friendly is to use screw piles. Screw pile installations have also extended to residential applications, with many homeowners choosing a screw pile foundation over other options. Some common applications for helical pile foundations include wooden decks, fences, garden houses, pergolas, and carports.

===Deep foundations===
Used to transfer the load of a structure down through the upper weak layer of topsoil to the stronger layer of subsoil below. There are different types of deep footings including impact driven piles, drilled shafts, caissons, screw piles, geo-piers and earth-stabilized columns. The naming conventions for different types of footings vary between different engineers. Historically, piles were wood, later steel, reinforced concrete, and pre-tensioned concrete.

====Monopile foundation====

A type of deep foundation which uses a single, generally large-diameter, structural element embedded into the earth to support all the loads (weight, wind, etc.) of a large above-surface structure.

Many monopile foundations have been used in recent years for economically constructing fixed-bottom offshore wind farms in shallow-water subsea locations. 
For example, a single wind farm off the coast of England went online in 2008 with over 100 turbines, each mounted on a 4.74-meter-diameter monopile footing in ocean depths up to 16 meters of water.

===Floating\barge===
A floating foundation is one that sits on a body of water, rather than dry land. This type of foundation is used for some bridges and floating buildings.

==Design==
Foundations are designed to have an adequate load capacity depending on the type of subsoil/rock supporting the foundation by a geotechnical engineer, and the footing itself may be designed structurally by a structural engineer. The primary design concerns are settlement and bearing capacity. When considering settlement, total settlement and differential settlement is normally considered. Differential settlement is when one part of a foundation settles more than another part. This can cause problems to the structure which the foundation is supporting. Expansive clay soils can also cause problems.

<text>In machining, numerical control, also called computer numerical control (CNC), is the automated control of tools by means of a computer. It is used to operate tools such as drills, lathes, mills, grinders, routers and 3D printers. CNC transforms a piece of material (metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, stone, or composite) into a specified shape by following coded programmed instructions and without a manual operator directly controlling the machining operation.

A CNC machine is a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform, which are both controlled by a computer, according to specific input instructions. Instructions are delivered to a CNC machine in the form of a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code and M-code, and then executed. The program can be written by a person or, far more often, generated by graphical computer-aided design (CAD) or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. In the case of 3D printers, the part to be printed is &quot;sliced&quot; before the instructions (or the program) are generated. 3D printers also use G-Code.

CNC offers greatly increased productivity over non-computerized machining for repetitive production, where the machine must be manually controlled (e.g. using devices such as hand wheels or levers) or mechanically controlled by pre-fabricated pattern guides (see pantograph mill). However, these advantages come at significant cost in terms of both capital expenditure and job setup time. For some prototyping and small batch jobs, a good machine operator can have parts finished to a high standard whilst a CNC workflow is still in setup.

In modern CNC systems, the design of a mechanical part and its manufacturing program are highly automated. The part&#x27;s mechanical dimensions are defined using CAD software and then translated into manufacturing directives by CAM software. The resulting directives are transformed (by &quot;post processor&quot; software) into the specific commands necessary for a particular machine to produce the component and then are loaded into the CNC machine.

Since any particular component might require the use of several different tools – drills, saws, touch probes etc. – modern machines often combine multiple tools into a single &quot;cell&quot;. In other installations, several different machines are used with an external controller and human or robotic operators that move the component from machine to machine. In either case, the series of steps needed to produce any part is highly automated and produces a part that meets every specification in the original CAD drawing, where each specification includes a tolerance.

==Description==
Motion is controlling multiple axes, normally at least two (X and Y), and a tool spindle that moves in the Z (depth). The position of the tool is driven by direct-drive stepper motors or servo motors to provide highly accurate movements, or in older designs, motors through a series of step-down gears. Open-loop control works as long as the forces are kept small enough and speeds are not too great. On commercial metalworking machines, closed-loop controls are standard and required to provide the accuracy, speed, and repeatability demanded.

===Parts description===

As the controller hardware evolved, the mills themselves also evolved. One change has been to enclose the entire mechanism in a large box as a safety measure (with safety glass in the doors to permit the operator to monitor the machine&#x27;s function), often with additional safety interlocks to ensure the operator is far enough from the working piece for safe operation. Most new CNC systems built today are 100% electronically controlled.

CNC-like systems are used for any process that can be described as movements and operations. These include laser cutting, welding, friction stir welding, ultrasonic welding, flame and plasma cutting, bending, spinning, hole-punching, pinning, gluing, fabric cutting, sewing, tape and fiber placement, routing, picking and placing, and sawing.

==History==

The first CNC machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s, based on existing tools that were modified with motors that moved the tool or part to follow points fed into the system on punched tape. These early servomechanisms were rapidly augmented with analog and digital computers, creating the modern CNC machine tools that have revolutionized machining processes.

== Today ==
Now the CNC in the processing manufacturing field has been very extensive, not only the traditional milling and turning, other machines and equipment are also installed with the corresponding CNC, which makes the manufacturing industry in its support, greatly improving the quality and efficiency. Of course, the latest trend in CNC is to combine traditional subtractive manufacturing with additive manufacturing (3D printing) to create a new manufacturing method - hybrid additive subtractive manufacturing (HASM). Another trend is the combination of AI, using a large number of sensors, with the goal of achieving flexible manufacturing.

==Examples of CNC machines==
==Other CNC tools==
Many other tools have CNC variants, including:

* 3D printing
* CNC riveting
* CNC router
* Canned cycle
* Cylindrical grinders
* Drills
* Embroidery machines
* Glass cutting
* Hot-wire foam cutters
* Induction hardening machines
* Laser cutting
* Lathes

* Milling machine
* Oxy-fuel
* Plasma cutters
* Sheet metal works (Turret punch)
* Submerged arc welding
* Surface grinder
* Tube, pipe and wire bending machines
* Vinyl cutter
* Water jet cutters
* Wood routers
==Tool/machine crashing==
In CNC, a &quot;crash&quot; occurs when the machine moves in such a way that is harmful to the machine, tools, or parts being machined, sometimes resulting in bending or breakage of cutting tools, accessory clamps, vises, and fixtures, or causing damage to the machine itself by bending guide rails, breaking drive screws, or causing structural components to crack or deform under strain. A mild crash may not damage the machine or tools but may damage the part being machined so that it must be scrapped. Many CNC tools have no inherent sense of the absolute position of the table or tools when turned on. They must be manually &quot;homed&quot; or &quot;zeroed&quot; to have any reference to work from, and these limits are just for figuring out the location of the part to work with it and are no hard motion limit on the mechanism. It is often possible to drive the machine outside the physical bounds of its drive mechanism, resulting in a collision with itself or damage to the drive mechanism. Many machines implement control parameters limiting axis motion past a certain limit in addition to physical limit switches. However, these parameters can often be changed by the operator.

Many CNC tools also do not know anything about their working environment. Machines may have load sensing systems on spindle and axis drives, but some do not. They blindly follow the machining code provided and it is up to an operator to detect if a crash is either occurring or about to occur, and for the operator to manually abort the active process. Machines equipped with load sensors can stop axis or spindle movement in response to an overload condition, but this does not prevent a crash from occurring. It may only limit the damage resulting from the crash. Some crashes may not ever overload any axis or spindle drives.

If the drive system is weaker than the machine&#x27;s structural integrity, then the drive system simply pushes against the obstruction, and the drive motors &quot;slip in place&quot;. The machine tool may not detect the collision or the slipping, so for example the tool should now be at 210mm on the X-axis, but is, in fact, at 32mm where it hit the obstruction and kept slipping. All of the next tool motions will be off by −178mm on the X-axis, and all future motions are now invalid, which may result in further collisions with clamps, vises, or the machine itself. This is common in open-loop stepper systems but is not possible in closed-loop systems unless mechanical slippage between the motor and drive mechanism has occurred. Instead, in a closed-loop system, the machine will continue to attempt to move against the load until either the drive motor goes into an overload condition or a servo motor fails to get to the desired position.

Collision detection and avoidance are possible, through the use of absolute position sensors (optical encoder strips or disks) to verify that motion occurred, or torque sensors or power-draw sensors on the drive system to detect abnormal strain when the machine should just be moving and not cutting, but these are not a common component of most hobby CNC tools. Instead, most hobby CNC tools simply rely on the assumed accuracy of stepper motors that rotate a specific number of degrees in response to magnetic field changes. It is often assumed the stepper is perfectly accurate and never missteps, so tool position monitoring simply involves counting the number of pulses sent to the stepper over time. An alternate means of stepper position monitoring is usually not available, so crash or slip detection is not possible.

Commercial CNC metalworking machines use closed-loop feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed-loop system, the controller monitors the actual position of each axis with an absolute or incremental encoder. Proper control programming will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated safely. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, chucks, turrets, tool holders, tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.

==Numerical precision and equipment backlash==
Within the numerical systems of CNC programming, the code generator can assume that the controlled mechanism is always perfectly accurate, or that precision tolerances are identical for all cutting or movement directions. While the common use of ball screws on most modern NC machines eliminates the vast majority of backlash, it still must be taken into account. CNC tools with a large amount of mechanical backlash can still be highly precise if the drive or cutting mechanism is only driven to apply cutting force from one direction, and all driving systems are pressed tightly together in that one cutting direction. However, a CNC device with high backlash and a dull cutting tool can lead to cutter chatter and possible workpiece gouging. The backlash also affects the precision of some operations involving axis movement reversals during cutting, such as the milling of a circle, where axis motion is sinusoidal. However, this can be compensated for if the amount of backlash is precisely known by linear encoders or manual measurement.

The high backlash mechanism itself is not necessarily relied on to be repeatedly precise for the cutting process, but some other reference object or precision surface may be used to zero the mechanism, by tightly applying pressure against the reference and setting that as the zero references for all following CNC-encoded motions. This is similar to the manual machine tool method of clamping a micrometer onto a reference beam and adjusting the Vernier dial to zero using that object as the reference.

==Positioning control system==
In numerical control systems, the position of the tool is defined by a set of instructions called the part program. Positioning control is handled using either an open-loop or a closed-loop system. In an open-loop system, communication takes place in one direction only: from the controller to the motor. In a closed-loop system, feedback is provided to the controller so that it can correct for errors in position, velocity, and acceleration, which can arise due to variations in load or temperature. Open-loop systems are generally cheaper but less accurate. Stepper motors can be used in both types of systems, while servo motors can only be used in closed systems.

===Cartesian coordinates===
The G &amp; M code positions are all based on a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This system is a typical plane often seen in mathematics when graphing. This system is required to map out the machine tool paths and any other kind of actions that need to happen in a specific coordinate. Absolute coordinates are what are generally used more commonly for machines and represent the (0,0,0) point on the plane. This point is set on the stock material to give a starting point or &quot;home position&quot; before starting the actual machining.

==Coding==
===G-codes===
G-codes are used to command specific movements of the machine, such as machine moves or drilling functions. The majority of G-code programs start with a percent (%) symbol on the first line, then followed by an &quot;O&quot; with a numerical name for the program (i.e. &quot;O0001&quot;) on the second line, then another percent (%) symbol on the last line of the program. The format for a G-code is the letter G followed by two to three digits; for example G01. G-codes differ slightly between a mill and lathe application, for example:

Having the correct speeds and feeds in the program provides for a more efficient and smoother product run. Incorrect speeds and feeds will cause damage to the tool, machine spindle, and even the product. The quickest and simplest way to find these numbers would be to use a calculator that can be found online. A formula can also be used to calculate the proper speeds and feeds for a material. These values can be found online or in Machinery&#x27;s Handbook.

<doc id="693368" wikidata="Q505585" url="?curid=693368" title="Maurice Hinchey">
<text>Maurice Dunlea Hinchey (October 27, 1938 – November 22, 2017) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative from New York and was a member of the Democratic Party. He retired at the end of his term in January 2013 after 20 years in Congress.

He was born in New York City, and later moved to the Hudson Valley where he attended high school and college, Hinchey had previously represented part of the area in the New York State Assembly since 1975. As chair of that body&#x27;s Environmental Conservation Committee, he took the lead in bringing environmental issues to the fore, particularly when he held hearings on the problems created by toxic waste disposal in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls. In his later years in Congress, he opposed hydraulic fracturing to exploit the natural gas resources of the Marcellus Shale. Throughout his career, he was considered a political progressive for his liberal stands on other issues.

==Early life, education and career==
Hinchey was born to a working-class family on the Lower West Side of Manhattan, the son of Rose (Bonack) and Maurice D. Hinchey. His mother was of Ukrainian descent and his father was the son of Irish immigrants. He grew up in Saugerties, New York.

After graduating from high school, Hinchey enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served in the Pacific on the destroyer USS &quot;Marshall&quot;. After being honorably discharged, he spent two years working as a laborer in a cement plant. While in college, he earned his tuition working as a toll collector on the New York State Thruway. He graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz with a B.A. in 1968 and an M.A. in 1970.

Hinchey first sought public office in 1972, with an unsuccessful race for the New York State Assembly. Ulster County was a Republican stronghold, but Hinchey ran successfully in 1974, becoming the first Democrat to represent Ulster County since 1912. Hinchey remained in the Assembly until 1992 and was a member of the 180th, 181st, 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures.

He was particularly noted for his work on protecting the natural environment. For 14 years, he chaired the Environmental Conservation Committee. Hinchey also served on the Ways and Means, Rules, Banks, Health, Higher Education, Labor, Energy and Agriculture committees.

During his chairmanship of the Committee on Environmental Conservation, the committee conducted a successful investigation into the causes of &quot;Love Canal,&quot; the nation&#x27;s first major toxic dump site. During his tenure, he aided in the passage of the country&#x27;s first law concerning regulation of acid rain. His committee also gained public attention for its investigation of the infiltration of the waste removal industry by organized crime.
==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Campaigns===
In 1992, 28th District Congressman Matthew F. McHugh retired after 18 years in the House. Hinchey won the Democratic nomination for the district, which had been renumbered the 26th after New York lost three districts as a result of the 1990 census. He defeated Republican Robert Moppert, a county legislator in Broome County (which includes Binghamton) in the November general election by a 50% – 47% margin. In 1994, Hinchey faced Moppert again; in that year&#x27;s Republican Revolution wave election, Hinchey won by only 1,200 votes.

Hinchey&#x27;s district was significantly reconfigured when New York lost two congressional seats after the 2000 census. Hinchey was threatened with dismemberment of his district or with having to run against a popular and well-established Republican incumbent, either Ben Gilman or Sherwood Boehlert. In the intense political infighting over the redistricting, however, Hinchey emerged as one of the winners. To protect two younger Republican incumbents, the Republicans agreed to sacrifice the district of the 79-year-old Gilman, who chose to retire. In return, the Democrats accepted a district that threw together two of their incumbents, Louise Slaughter and John LaFalce, prompting the latter&#x27;s retirement. Hinchey&#x27;s district was renumbered the 22nd and wound a narrow, contorted path across eight counties in the southern part of the state, from the Hudson River through the Catskills and Binghamton to Ithaca, connecting the most politically liberal parts of the Southern Tier and Borscht Belt regions. This gerrymandered configuration is similar to the former New York&#x27;s 26th congressional district.

Hinchey ran in historically Republican areas throughout his career (his Assembly district was held by Republicans from 1915 until McHugh won it for the Democrats in 1975). He is best categorized as having been a progressive populist. For example, he was one of the first and most outspoken opponents of the 2003 war in Iraq, and one of only 11 co-sponsors of the Kucinich Resolution to impeach President Bush. He bridged the ideological gap with a reputation for supporting many measures to improve integrity in government, by popular (in New York) advocacy of strong environmental protection, and by diligent constituent services. He sat on the Appropriations Committee, a post that helped him to deliver federal support on programs important to his district.

In 2010, Hinchey was elected to his tenth and final term, with a 52% to 48% margin over Republican George Phillips of Binghamton.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Narcotics Abuse and Control Caucus
* Congressional Native American Caucus
* Congressional Progressive Caucus.
* Education Caucus
* International Conservation Caucus
* Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus
* Steel Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus

Hinchey was one of 31 members of the House who voted to uphold the objection to counting the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election put forth by Ohio Rep. Tubbs Jones in order to encourage &quot;a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities&quot;. Republican President George Bush had won the state by 118,457 votes after a recount.

On June 18, 2008, he stated: &quot;Should the people of the United States own refineries? Maybe so. Frankly, I think that&#x27;s a good idea,&quot; but conceded it was unlikely the government would do so, and suggested putting national pressure on the oil companies.

===Energy===
Hinchey was an original co-sponsor of the Small Business Clean Energy Financing Act. The act contributed about $630 million in loans to environmentally friendly energy companies in the years between 2006 and 2009. Hinchey was a solar energy supporter; he helped organize the non-profit organization called The Solar Energy Consortium (TSEC). TSEC supports the growth of a solar energy industry in New York, creating green jobs in the Hudson Valley area. Hinchey supported the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act. The bill supports green energy by offering rebates to homeowners who improve their homes to conserve more energy.

In 2010 midterm elections, Hinchey clashed with his opponent over shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing in upstate New York. Hinchey was against gas drilling in this area. Also, the Obama administration refused a request by Hinchey to slow down drilling in New York and Pennsylvania. Along with Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Hinchey introduced legislation called the &quot;FRAC Act&quot; which proposes lifting fracturing exemptions and forcing public disclosure of chemicals used.

===Environment===
Hinchey supported the Clean Air Act and did not approve of the Bush administration&#x27;s decision to roll back the New Source Review (NSR) component of the Act, fearing it would result in increased acid rain and more pollution of the lakes of the area.

Hinchey appeared in the 2010 documentary &quot;Gasland&quot;, discussing the FRAC Act, which he co-sponsored.

===Medical marijuana===
Hinchey introduced the Hinchey–Rohrabacher amendment in 2001, to prohibit the Justice Department from taking actions to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. The amendment failed 152–273 upon its initial vote in 2003 and was defeated several more times in subsequent years up until Hinchey&#x27;s 2012 retirement. In 2014, however, the amendment passed the House as the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment and was signed into law, providing supporters of medical cannabis with a key victory at the federal level.

In 2009, the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations approved adding a provision authored by Hinchey to the committee report on the fiscal 2010 Justice Department appropriations bill, requesting &quot;clarification of the Department&#x27;s policy regarding enforcement of federal laws and use of federal resources against individuals involved in medical marijuana activities.&quot;

===Abortion===

Hinchey supported a pro-choice position on abortion issues. He was a cosponsor of the Freedom of Choice Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which seeks federal protection of free access to women&#x27;s clinics and he fought Republican attempts to reduce abortion rights. Hinchey was also an advocate for family planning programs, including the Title X program.

However, Hinchey opposed late-term abortions except where necessary to protect the health of the mother.

===Honors===
Hinchey was made an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau on September 4, 2009, by the Ambassador of the Netherlands in capacity of Queen Beatrix. He was awarded the Dutch royal order for his work to commemorate the quadricentennial anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s exploration and discovery of the river in New York and for Hinchey&#x27;s efforts to strengthen the U.S.-Netherlands relationship.

Representative Hinchey voted yes on H.R. 2433
Veterans Opportunity to Work Act of 2011. This law amended title 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements in the laws relating to the employment and training of veterans, and for other purposes.

Hinchey, in August 2010, voted yes on the &quot;Offshore Drilling and Other Energy Laws Amendments.&quot; This regulates or controls the use of oil and natural gas. It also increases safety on blowout preventers on oil wells, as well as upping the penalty for leaking or spilling of oil or &quot;other hazardous substances&quot; into the Gulf of Mexico. He also voted to repeal Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell in March 2010. This makes it illegal to dismiss someone from the army for being homosexual, having engaged in or suspected of engaging in &quot;homosexual acts.&quot;

Another bill Hinchey voted yes on, the Aid to States for Medicaid, Teacher Employment and Other purposes, passed in the House in August 2010. This budgets $10 billion to the Education Jobs Fund to be given to the states for teacher hiring and training. It also increases Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) to states in need and lengthens the period for states to increase their FMAP.

In November 2011, he voted to reaffirm &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as the national motto and &quot;encourag[e] the public display of the national motto in all public buildings, public schools, and other government institutions.&quot;

===Speeches and public statements===
In a letter sent on November 10, 2010, to Jeffrey Zients, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Hinchey promoted the support of Job Corps. This program helps high-school dropouts find careers and receive their high school diplomas or GED&#x27;s. He asked Zients for increased federal funding for this recovery program in the 2012 budget.

On October 18, 2010, Hinchey held a Medicare forum to reassure seniors about provisions in the health care bill that would or would not change parts of Social Security 
and Medicare. He stated that the health care reform bill would increase the efficiency of Medicare; the Act would not cut into Medicare or social security funding.

Hinchey wrote a letter to President Barack Obama in October 2010 regarding Social Security. In the letter, he described to Obama how he believes social security is important and urged the President to increase its budget in the upcoming year.

===Arctic offshore drilling===
In May 2010, Hinchey, along with two other Progressive democrats, Lois Capps and Jay Inslee, began a petition to ask Obama to delay Shell from beginning exploratory drilling near Alaska. They wanted to understand the causes of the Gulf oil spills before Shell went ahead with Offshore drilling. Hinchey and the others were worried about the environmental effects if an accident were to occur; in the Arctic waters, a spill would not be contained as in the Gulf spill. Another priority was assuring native communities would not be harmed; since they often depend on fish and marine life to sustain them, their resources would be depleted if a spill happened.

===Bush administration&#x27;s warrantless surveillance program===

After the &quot;New York Times&quot; first disclosed the existence of the Bush administration&#x27;s warrantless surveillance program in late 2005, Hinchey was among the earliest members of Congress to criticize the program. Not long after, Hinchey—along with three other House Democrats—John Lewis of Georgia, Henry Waxman of California, and Lynn Woolsey of California—wrote the Justice Department, requesting an investigation to determine whether Bush administration violated any laws in authorizing and carrying out the program. As a result, the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) commenced an investigation. It was later disclosed the OPR investigation was closed when President Bush refused to allow the Justice Department attorneys who were to conduct the investigation to have the security clearances to conduct the inquiry. After a public outcry, President Bush capitulated and allowed the investigators to have their security clearances so they could conduct the inquiry. 
===1994 gun incident===

In December 1994, Hinchey was issued a summons after X-ray machines at Washington National Airport found a loaded .32-caliber handgun in his carry-on luggage before he boarded a flight. Hinchey claims to have forgotten the handgun was in his luggage. He pleaded no contest and was fined.
Hinchey was informally advised to carry a handgun for personal protection by NYS Law Enforcement investigators when, as Chair of the NYS Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, he conducted a major investigation into the repeated dumping of toxic waste into an Orange County NY Landfill by Organized Crime. The advice was given after the mysterious disappearance of a key worker at the landfill. 

===Retirement===

In January 2012, Hinchey held a news conference at Senate House in Kingston, where he had announced his first run for Congress two decades earlier, to announce his retirement. &quot;It&#x27;s time for someone else&quot;, he told assembled reporters. His illness and age had been factors.

He denied his decision to step down had anything to do with the state&#x27;s pending redistricting but said he wanted to make his intentions clear before the process was completed. His departure was seen as making it easier for the state&#x27;s Democratic Party to decide which member of its congressional delegation would have to give up their district since New York had to eliminate two of its seats that year. Hinchey&#x27;s seat was one of two, the other being that of newly elected Republican Bob Turner, eliminated in redistricting.

==Personal life==

On April 22, 2011, Hinchey&#x27;s office announced he was being treated for a curable form of colon cancer. A statement released by his office said Hinchey would have surgery at the Albany Medical Center, receive treatment at the Ulster Radiation Oncology Center in Kingston, New York, and also undergo chemotherapy. The statement said he would continue to work during his treatment.
Hinchey had three children, one of whom, Michelle, went on to become a New York State Senator. He and his wife, Ilene Marder Hinchey, resided together in Saugerties, New York.

===Death===
Shortly after being treated for colon cancer, Hinchey began experiencing symptoms of frontotemporal dementia, a diagnosis that his family did not make public until 2017. Hinchey died from the disease at his home in Saugerties on November 22, 2017, at age 79. In December 2017, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution honoring Hinchey.

On July 26, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a bill renaming the Saugerties Post Office after Hinchey.

<doc id="693370" wikidata="Q3984104" url="?curid=693370" title="A Cyborg Manifesto">
<text>&quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; is an essay written by Donna Haraway and first published in 1985 in the &quot;Socialist Review&quot; under the title &quot;A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s.&quot; In it, the concept of the cyborg represents a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating &quot;human&quot; from &quot;animal&quot; and &quot;human&quot; from &quot;machine.&quot; Haraway writes: &quot;The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust.&quot;

The &quot;Manifesto&quot; challenges traditional notions of feminism, particularly feminism that focuses on identity politics, and instead encourages coalition through affinity. Haraway uses the concept of a cyborg to represent the plasticity of identity and to highlight the limitations of socially imposed identities; the &quot;Manifesto&quot; is considered a major milestone in the development of feminist posthumanist theory.

Given its composition in the mid-1980s, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; also includes many references to the political context of the period, including the geopolitical tensions of the late Cold War, the anti-nuclear protests of the Livermore Action Group, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; missile defense initiative, and the rise of the new right in the United States.

==Summary==

Haraway begins the &quot;Manifesto&quot; by explaining three boundary breakdowns since the 20th century that have allowed for her hybrid, cyborg myth: those between human and animal, animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution, she claims, has blurred the lines between human and animal; 20th-century machines have blurred the lines between natural and artificial; and microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have blurred the lines of physicality.

Haraway&#x27;s piece is a novel approach to examining the culture-nature divide. She introduces the potential of a completely new ontology of hybridization of nature and culture through the cyborg, a combination of machine and organism. Haraway&#x27;s use of the cyborg illustrates her conceptualizations of socialism and feminism in the examinations of dichotomies such as nature/culture, mind/body, and idealism/materialism. Haraway&#x27;s cyborgs are a blending of imagination and material reality. The cyborg is a dualism, as opposed to a dichotomy; there is value perceived in the confusion of the borders of bounded categories. The need for the divide between culture and nature is no longer relevant, and the cyborg emerges from the blending of that boundary.

===Issues with Western patriarchal tenets===
Haraway highlights what she sees as the problematic use and justification of historical Western ideologies like patriarchy, colonialism, essentialism, and naturalism (among others). These traditions in turn allow for the problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the Other) and what Haraway explains as &quot;antagonistic dualisms&quot; that order Western discourse. These dualisms, Haraway states, &quot;have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all [those] constituted as others.&quot; She highlights specific problematic dualisms of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these dualisms are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic dualisms.

There is also the idea that cyborgs are beings that have been uncoupled from organic reproduction. Haraway also distinguishes the cyborg from other literary ideas that are lacking in their parentage such as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, because that parentage is no longer a relevant or desired connection. Haraway paints the cyborg as the illegitimate offspring of patriarchal capitalism; because that connection isn&#x27;t sought or is irrelevant, the cyborg is not beholden to its capitalistic, patriarchal, and neoliberal origins. There are social and bodily realities that come about from the joint kinship with both organisms and machines that inform on the identities of cyborgs to be permanently partial identities, incorporating aspects of both. The struggle is to see from both perspectives at once, and can provide an archetype for resistance, as another of Haraway&#x27;s premises is about the need for unity of people in the face of what she refers to as “world wide intensification of domination.”

===Cyborg theory===
Haraway&#x27;s cyborg theory rejects the notions of essentialism, proposing instead a chimeric, monstrous world of fusions between animal and machine. Cyborg theory relies on writing as &quot;the technology of cyborgs,&quot; and asserts that &quot;cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism.&quot; Instead, Haraway&#x27;s cyborg calls for a non-essentialized, material-semiotic metaphor capable of uniting diffuse political coalitions along the lines of affinity rather than identity. Following Lacanian feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Haraway&#x27;s work addresses the chasm between feminist discourses and the dominant language of Western patriarchy. As Haraway explains, &quot;grammar is politics by other means,&quot; and effective politics require speaking in the language of domination. Still, as Haraway states, &quot;Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.&quot; These stories are &quot;communications devices&quot; which &quot;can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies,&quot; dualisms which engender the illusion of perfect coded communication. Haraway mentions Octavia Butler, John Varley, and Vonda McIntyre as authors/artists whose work constitute a feminist science fiction of cyborg stories.

As she details in a chart of the paradigmatic shifts from modern to postmodern epistemology within the Manifesto, the unified human subject of identity has shifted to the hybridized posthuman of technoscience, from &quot;representation&quot; to &quot;simulation&quot;, &quot;bourgeois novel&quot; to &quot;science fiction&quot;, &quot;reproduction&quot; to &quot;replication&quot;, and &quot;white capitalist patriarchy&quot; to &quot;informatics of domination&quot;. While Haraway&#x27;s &quot;ironic dream of a common language&quot; is inspired by Irigaray&#x27;s argument for a discourse other than patriarchy, she rejects Irigaray&#x27;s essentializing construction of woman-as-not-male to argue for a linguistic community of situated, partial knowledges in which no one is innocent.

In her discussion of cyborg theory, Haraway describes two possible worlds resulting from embracing cyborg identity. The first future, which aligns with the view point taken by socialist and radical feminism, is that the breaking down of the boundary between the organism and technology will represent the final conquering of the oppressed body. The second future, which Haraway offers as an alternative in her critique of binary thinking, allows for kinship between boundaries and acceptance of fluid and contradictory identities. These futures function within her argument for cyborg theory in that she sees the acknowledgment of both possibilities as necessary for understanding intersecting forces of oppression and preparing for how technological advancement will change the ways that political forces as well as identity and kinship will function in the future.

===Criticism of traditional feminism===
Haraway takes issue with some traditional feminists, reflected in statements describing how &quot;women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological (relating to the theory of knowledge) position potentially.&quot; The views of traditional feminism operate under the totalizing assumptions that all men are one way, and women another, whereas &quot;a cyborg theory of wholes and parts,&quot; does not desire to explain things in total theory. Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism, criticizing feminist tactics as &quot;identity politics&quot; that victimize those excluded, and she proposes that it is better strategically to confuse identities. Her criticism mainly focuses on socialist and radical feminism. The former, she writes, achieves &quot;to expand the category of labour to what (some) women did&quot;. Socialist feminism does not naturalize but rather builds a unity that was non-existent before - namely the woman worker. On the other hand, radical feminism, according to Catharine MacKinnon, describes a world in which the woman only exists in opposition to the man. The concept of woman is socially constructed within the patriarchal structure of society and women only exist because men have made them exist. The woman as a self does not exist. Haraway criticizes both when writing that &quot;my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice&quot; and &quot;MacKinnon&#x27;s intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the &#x27;essential&#x27; non-existence of women is not reassuring&quot; (299).

Haraway also indirectly critiques white feminism by highlighting the struggles of women of color: she suggests that a woman of color &quot;might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her &#x27;biomythography.&#x27;&quot;

To counteract the essentializing and anachronistic rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists, who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.

===Call to action===
Haraway calls for a revision of the concept of gender, moving away from Western patriarchal essentialism and toward &quot;the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender,&quot; stating that &quot;Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.&quot;

Haraway also calls for a reconstruction of identity, no longer dictated by naturalism and taxonomy but instead by affinity, wherein individuals can construct their own groups by choice. In this way, groups may construct a &quot;post-modernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity&quot; as a way to counter Western traditions of exclusive identification.

== Publication history ==
Haraway began writing the &quot;Manifesto&quot; in 1983 to address the &quot;Socialist Review &quot;request for American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of socialist feminism in the context of the early Reagan era and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the &quot;Socialist Review &quot;East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley &quot;Socialist Review&quot; Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier. The essay was most widely read as part of Haraway&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Simians, Cyborgs and Women&quot;. In 2006, a variorum edition of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was published in &quot;The International Handbook of Virtual Learning Environments&quot; integrating variations from the various versions and returning references and some of the scholarly apparatus that had become separated from the text.

== Updates and revisions ==
Although Haraway&#x27;s metaphor of the cyborg has been labelled as a post-gender statement, Haraway has clarified her stance on post-genderism in some interviews. She acknowledges that her argument in the &quot;Manifesto&quot; seeks to challenge the necessity for categorization of gender, but does not correlate this argument to post-genderism. She clarifies this distinction because post-genderism is often associated with the discourse of the utopian concept of being beyond masculinity and femininity. Haraway notes that gender constructs are still prevalent and meaningful, but are troublesome and should therefore be eliminated as categories for identity.

==Applications of &quot;The Cyborg&quot;==
Although Haraway intended her concept of the cyborg to be a feminist critique, she acknowledges that other scholars and popular media have taken her concept and applied it to different contexts. Haraway is aware and receptive of the different uses of her concept of the cyborg, but admits &quot;very few people are taking what I consider all of its parts&quot;. &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; overlooked the feminist theory of the cyborg and instead used it to make a more literal commentary about the enmeshment of humans and technology. Despite this, Haraway also recognizes that new feminist scholars &quot;embrace and use the cyborg of the manifesto to do what they want for their own purposes&quot;.

=== &quot;Patchwork Girl&quot; ===
&quot;Patchwork Girl&quot;, a hypertext work, makes use of elements from &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot;. &quot;Patchwork Girl&#x27;s&quot; &quot;thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is apparent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scarred and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line...Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its &#x27;limbs&#x27; or links to different sections of the text.&quot; In Jackson&#x27;s narrative, the Patchwork Girl is an aborted female monster created by Victor Frankenstein of Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, &quot; an abhorrent and monstrous creature that is &quot;part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and &#x27;razed&#x27; up through hypertext technology.&quot; The monster, following her destruction by Victor, is sewn back together by Mary Shelley herself, while simultaneously becoming Mary&#x27;s lover; she is thus, &quot;a cyborg who is queer, dis-proportioned, and visibly scarred. She both facilitates and undermines preoccupations with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to &#x27;catch&#x27; and one day prevent.&quot; The Patchwork Girl embraces Haraway&#x27;s conception of a cybernetic posthuman being in both her physical multiplicity and her challenge towards &quot;the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics.&quot;

=== &quot;Cyborg Goddesses&quot; ===
Turkish critical scholar Leman Giresunlu uses Haraway&#x27;s cyborg as framework to examine current science fiction movies such as &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in her essay &quot;Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited&quot;. In this essay, she explores how her new concept of the &quot;cyborg goddess,&quot; a female figure &quot;capable of inflicting pain and pleasure simultaneously&quot;, can be used to make sense of how female representation is shifting towards a more multidimensional stance. Giresunlu builds from Haraway&#x27;s cyborg because the &quot;cyborg goddess&quot; goes beyond &quot;offering a way out from [the] duality&quot; and instead provides how spirituality and technology work together to form a complex and more accurate representation of women.

=== &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; ===
In her essay &quot;Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, American critical scholar Ruthellen Cunnally uses Haraway&#x27;s cyborg to help make sense of how Robert Scott Carey, the protagonist of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, transforms into a cyborg in the midst of a metaphor of cold war politics in his home. As Robert continues to shrink, the gendered power dynamic between him and his wife Louise shifts from &quot;the realm of husband/wife into the mode of mother/son&quot;. When Robert finds himself lost in the feminine space of the basement, an area of the house that was reserved for Louise&#x27;s domestic duties of sewing and washing, he is forced to fight for his life and reclaim his masculinity. Although he is able to conquer some of his foes and regain his &quot;manhood&quot;, the gender lines do not become established again because there is no one to share and implement the gendered power structure with. Robert&#x27;s transformation presents &quot;an existence in which acceptance and meaning are released from the limitations of patriarchal dualisms&quot;, which aligns with Haraway&#x27;s cyborg.

==Reviews and criticism==
Traditional feminists have criticized &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; as anti-feminist because it denies any commonalities of the female experience. In the &quot;Manifesto&quot;&quot;,&quot; Haraway writes &quot;there is nothing about being &#x27;female&#x27; that naturally binds women&quot;, which goes against a defining characteristic of traditional feminism that calls women to join in order to advocate for members of their gender.

Criticism and controversy surrounded the essay&#x27;s publication history: the East Coast Collective of the &quot;Socialist Review&quot; found the piece &quot;a naive embrace of technology&quot; and advocated against its publication, while The Berkeley Collective ultimately insisted that it go to print. The essay has been described as &quot;controversial&quot; and &quot;viral&quot; in its circulation through multiple academic departments and disciplinary boundaries, contributing to the critical discourse on its claims.
This controversiality was matched by its omnipresence; Jackie Orr, Associate Professor of Sociology at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs Syracuse University, writes, &quot;It is hard to be a feminist graduate student in the U.S. humanities or social sciences after 1985 and not be touched in some way by the Cyborg Manifesto.&quot; The rapid adoption of the article in academic circles also increased the pace of the critical conversation surrounding the work, and in 1990, Haraway felt that the essay had &quot;acquired a surprise half life,&quot; which made it &quot;impossible to rewrite&quot; and necessitated revisiting the topic in her subsequent publications.

Many critiques of &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; focus on a basic level of reader comprehension and writing style, such as Orr&#x27;s observation that &quot;undergraduate students in a science and technology class find the Cyborg Manifesto curiously relevant but somewhat impenetrable to read.&quot; This is corroborated by Helen Merrick and Margret Grebowicz&#x27;s observation that scientists who reviewed &quot;Primate Visions&quot; had similar issues, particularly as related to Haraway&#x27;s use of irony. Judy Wajcman, Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, suggests in &quot;TechnoFeminism&quot; that &quot;the openness of her writing to a variety of readings is intentional,&quot; which &quot;can sometimes make Haraway difficult to interpret;&quot; however, it does not seem that Wajcman critiques Haraway&#x27;s tone for its capability to encompass more possibilities, rather than limit them. Wajcman concludes her chapter &quot;Send in the Cyborgs&quot; on a critical note, claiming that &quot;Certainly, Haraway is much stronger at providing evocative figurations of a new feminist subjectivity than she is at providing guidelines for a practical emancipatory politics.&quot;

Critiques of Haraway have also centered on the accessibility of the thematic topics she discusses in her writing, and according to third-wave feminist readings, her work &quot;assumes a reader who is familiar with North American culture,&quot; and posits that &quot;readers without the appropriate cultural capital are...likely to find it infuriatingly obscure and impenetrable.&quot; Therefore, Haraway&#x27;s symbolism is representative of North American culture symbolizing a &quot;non-universalizing vision for feminist strategies&quot; and &quot;has been taken up within cyberfeminism as the symbol of an essential female being.&quot; Considering the question of accessibility more broadly, disability studies have focused on Haraway&#x27;s essay, noting the absence of &quot;any kind of critical engagement with disability...disabled bodies are simply presented as exemplary...requiring neither analysis nor critique&quot;—a gap which Alison Kafer, Professor of Feminist Studies at Southwestern University, attempts to address in &quot;Feminist, Queer, Crip&quot;. Wajcman also argues that Haraway&#x27;s view of technology in &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; is perhaps too totalizing, and that the binary of &quot;the cyborg solution and the goddess solution&quot; ultimately &quot;caricatures feminism&quot; by focusing too readily on a dichotomy that may in fact be a false one.

In &quot;Unfinished Work-From Cyborg to Cognisphere&quot;, N. Katherine Hayles questions the validity of cyborg as a unit of analysis. She says that because of the complicated situation of technology and media, &quot;cyborg is no longer the individual person – or for that matter, the individual cyborg – is no longer the appropriate unit of analysis, if indeed it ever was.&quot;

As for the relationships between cyborg and religion, Robert A. Campbell argues that &quot;in spite of Haraway&#x27;s efforts to move beyond traditional Western dualisms and offer a new hope for women, and by extension of humanity and the world, what she in fact offers is a further legitimation for buying into the not so new American civil religion of high technology.&quot; He says that &quot;in spite of what some may view as a radical critique of the present and a potentially frightening prescription for the future, the stark reality about Haraway&#x27;s &#x27;postmodern reality&#x27; is that there is no such thing.&quot;

Beyond its presence in academic context, &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; has also had popular traction including &quot;Wired&quot;″s piece by Hari Kunzru and &quot;Mute&quot;, BuzzFeed,
 as well as &quot;Vice&quot;. Retrospective articles consistently mark its anniversary.

In 2018, the disability rights activist and self-described cyborg Jillian Weise argued that &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; erased disabled people and appropriated the aesthetic of disability.

=== Sonographic fetus as cyborg ===
Scholar Marilyn Maness Mehaffy writes that the &quot;sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is &#x27;created&#x27; in a space of virtuality that straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text.&quot; Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway&#x27;s posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, &quot;is publicly envisioned as both independent of [its mother&#x27;s] body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women.&quot; In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies &quot;reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt.&quot; Valerie Hartouni argues, &quot;most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the &#x27;order of nature&#x27;&quot; which would make Haraway&#x27;s vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.

<doc id="693383" wikidata="Q377643" url="?curid=693383" title="Ridge lift">
<text>Ridge lift (or slope lift) is created when a wind strikes an obstacle, usually a mountain ridge or cliff, that is large and steep enough to deflect the wind upward.

If the wind is strong enough, the ridge lift provides enough upward force for gliders, hang gliders, paragliders and birds to stay airborne for long periods or travel great distances by &#x27;Ridge soaring&#x27;. Although unpowered aircraft are usually descending through the air, they will climb if the surrounding air is rising faster than their sink rates. Model glider enthusiasts refer to this technique as &quot;slope gliding&quot; or &quot;sloping&quot;.

Orville Wright used ridge lift, setting a duration record of 11 minutes in 1911. However the sport of soaring started in Germany after the First World War. In 1921, Dr. Wolfgang Klemperer broke the Wright Brothers’ 1911 soaring duration record with a flight of 13 minutes. In 1922, Arthur Martens became the first glider pilot to use an updraft rising along a mountain slope to stay aloft for a lengthy period, with a flight over an hour.

== Basic requirements ==

Ridge lift is generated when the wind blows against a hill, ridge, escarpment or ocean wave, causing the air to rise. In meteorology this is known as orographic lift. The wind creates a region of rising air directly above the slope, which may extend some distance upwards and outwards from its face because the airflow follows the upward contour of the hill. However, at near vertical cliffs, there is usually an area of turbulence with descending air near the base of the cliff. Downwind of the hill, lee waves can form; these are also used by glider pilots to gain height, but this should not be confused with slope lift.

Near slopes rather than vertical cliffs, the strongest lift is often to be found in a flight path that intersects with an imaginary line emerging at right angles from the slope.

Long mountain ranges such as those found in Ridge-and-valley Appalachians in the United States, New Zealand, and Chile have been used by glider pilots to fly in excess of a thousand kilometers in a single flight. Birds, such as many seabirds (in particular albatross) and raptors, also use slopes in this way.

<text>Sutro Tower is a unique three-legged tall TV and radio lattice tower located in San Francisco, California. Rising from a hill between Twin Peaks and Mount Sutro near Clarendon Heights, it is a prominent feature of the city skyline and a landmark for city residents and visitors. The tower was the tallest structure in San Francisco from the time of its completion in 1973 until it was surpassed by the Salesforce Tower in 2018.

The tower is named after Mount Sutro. Adolph Gilbert Sutro, grandson of former mayor Adolph Sutro, built a mansion, &quot;La Avanzada&quot;, on the family property in the highest peaks of San Francisco. In 1948, the mansion and property were sold to the American Broadcasting Company, where it became the original home of their San Francisco operation as KGO Television. KGO then formed a consortium with KTVU, KRON, and KPIX, the three other major San Francisco television broadcasters at the time, to build and maintain the tower. It stands above ground and above sea level. It is the second tallest structure in the city by ground-to-tip height, though its mountain location overlooks the city&#x27;s downtown skyscrapers.

==History==

Before the construction of Sutro Tower in 1973, television reception in San Francisco was spotty because the many hills of the city blocked the line-of-sight television signal. The great height of the new tower helped to resolve that problem. Transmitters had been scattered throughout the Bay Area, including at San Bruno Mountain, Mt. Allison, Monument Peak, and Mt. Diablo. By having all the main Bay Area television station transmitters in one location, reception was improved by allowing a receiving antenna pointed in a single direction to receive all those stations rather than a subset.

Local residents opposed the tower even before it was completed, including criticism of the aesthetic effect the tower would have on the rest of San Francisco. San Francisco writer Herb Caen once wrote, &quot;I keep waiting for it to stalk down the hill and attack the Golden Gate Bridge.&quot;

When first built, the long legs of the tower were illuminated at night with long tubes of white light that looked like long fluorescent tubes. However, public outcry resulted in the lights being removed soon after they were turned on. Despite the initial revulsion of some residents, Sutro Tower is now recognized by many as a Bay Area icon. A local entertainment guide, &quot;SF Station&quot;, uses it as a logo, as does the collaborative art game &quot;SFZero&quot;. In 2022, Sutro Tower was included in the video game &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot; as one of the prominent landmarks in the San Francisco area.

Beginning in 2019, one of the three upper antenna assemblies was temporarily removed for the installation of new antennas for the FCC spectrum repacking. Antenna installation for the repacking was completed on May 1, 2020. Additionally, &quot;To accommodate some final project cleanup work, some stations will broadcast from their auxiliary antennas intermittently between mid-July and mid-August.&quot;

==Construction==

Construction began in 1971 by Kline Towers of Columbia, South Carolina. The tower was completed in 1973, with the first transmissions on July 4, 1973. Approximately of concrete were used to make the foundation of the 1,700 ton (3.7 million pound) tower. Earthquake proofing includes ballasting two-thirds of the weight of the structure below ground, resulting in a center of gravity at sixteen feet below ground level. It is used to transmit the signals of eleven television stations and four FM radio stations and for various other communications services.

The tower is owned by Sutro Tower Inc., a nonprofit corporation, which in turn is owned by a consortium of the four major television broadcasters in San Francisco at the time of its construction: KTVU (previously owned by Cox Media Group, now owned by Fox Television Stations); KRON-TV (owned by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; at the time of the tower&#x27;s completion, now owned by Nexstar Media Group); KPIX (a former Westinghouse Broadcasting property, now owned by CBS); and KGO-TV (an ABC-owned station). Sutro Tower also leases space to other Bay Area radio and television stations, including PBS outlet KQED; independent station KOFY-TV; non-commercial station KPJK; and KPYX, a sister station to KPIX. With the advent of channel-sharing agreements after the 2016 FCC spectrum auction, San Jose&#x27;s KQEH began to transmit from Sutro with sister station KQED on January 17, 2018, moving from its former Monument Peak transmitter.

Three other major Bay Area TV stations are unable to be located at Sutro Tower—the NBC-owned duopoly of KNTV and KSTS; and KTVU&#x27;s duopoly partner KICU-TV. KNTV, which assumed the area&#x27;s NBC affiliation from KRON-TV in 2002, relocated its transmitter from Loma Prieta Peak to San Bruno Mountain, south of Sutro Tower; KSTS and KICU-TV transmit from east of Fremont. Those locations allow these stations to maintain primary coverage over San Jose and the South Bay, as San Jose is the city of license for all three stations.

==Access==

The facility is accessible only by authorized vehicles. The area near the site offers beautiful panoramic viewpoints of San Francisco. There is a platform near the top of the tower, above ground and above sea level. Only authorized maintenance workers can access the tower via a small two-person elevator that runs inside the west tower enclosed leg. There is no public access within the Sutro Tower property lines.

On a clear day, the tower can be seen from the East Bay peak of Mount Diablo and is sometimes the only part of San Francisco seen above the coastal fog when it is blown inland, typically on summer mornings and evenings.

==Stations==

===Television===
TV stations that transmit from Sutro Tower include the following. Most of these stations carry additional subchannels on their frequencies. Subchannel affiliations are shown via the digital channels link.

===Radio===

FM stations that transmit from Sutro Tower include KEXC (Formerly KREV) (92.7), KOIT (96.5), KSOL (98.9), KOSF (103.7), and KNBR-FM (104.5).

Others believe that the word &quot;sartoris&quot; comes from the Medieval Latin past participle &quot;exsartum&quot; (&quot;cleared for cultivation&quot;), from Latin &quot;sartum&quot; (&quot;hoed&quot;), and means &quot;estate of the land-clearers&quot;, probably in reference to the deforestation that took place around Sartrouville in Antiquity or in the Early Middle Ages to enable the cultivation of the land.

<doc id="693391" wikidata="Q4589550" url="?curid=693391" title="1994 London Israeli embassy bombing">
<text>The 1994 London Israeli Embassy bombing was a car bomb attack on 26 July 1994 against the Israeli embassy building in London, England. Twenty civilians were injured. A second bomb was exploded outside Balfour House, Finchley, premises occupied by the UJIA, a registered British charity.

== The attack ==
A car containing of explosives parked in front of the embassy blew up minutes after the driver left it. The blast, which caused widespread damage, was heard over a mile away. Apart from damage to the embassy building, shop windows were blown out. The attack took place one day after King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin met in Washington, D.C. to discuss a Jordan-Israel peace treaty.

Thirteen hours later another car bomb exploded outside Balfour House, which at the time was the London headquarters of one of the largest Jewish charities, The United Jewish Israel Appeal (UJIA), injuring six.

== Aftermath ==
Initially, the Israeli ambassador and British intelligence experts were blaming &quot;pro-Iranian extremists, probably linked to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah group.&quot; Between the two attacks, letters were sent to two Arab newspapers claiming responsibility for both bombs on behalf of the &quot;Palestinian Resistance Jaffa Group&quot;.

Five Palestinians were arrested in London in January 1995 in connection with the bombings. In December 1996, two of them, both Palestinian science graduates educated in the UK, Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, were found guilty of &quot;conspiracy to cause explosions&quot; at the Old Bailey. They were sentenced to 20 years in jail, and lost their appeal in 2001.

Botmeh was released from prison in 2008.

Former MI5 agent David Shayler stated that the British security services were warned of a plan to attack the embassy in advance, yet took no action. The Crown Prosecution Service later confirmed a warning had been received, though it related to a plan by a group unconnected to those who were convicted of the bombing. The Home Secretary at the time, Jack Straw, said that Shayler&#x27;s interpretation of events was understandable, but concluded that MI5 still could not have prevented the bombing.

==Convicted==
Samar Alami, a Lebanese-Palestinian woman and daughter of a banker, graduated with a BSc in chemical engineering from University College London and an MSc from Imperial College London.

Jawad Botmeh, a Palestinian student based in London, graduated with degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Leicester and King&#x27;s College London.

Alami and Botmeh were convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom. During the trial Alami and Botmeh were accused of being part of a team that had planned the bombing but were not accused of planting the bomb themselves or being present at the scene of the crime. There was no direct evidence linking the suspects to the bombing. Another woman involved in carrying out the bombing has never been found. In the course of the trial, both suspects did admit that they had conducted experiments using home made explosives in order to pass information back to Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories. Botmeh and Alami were convicted of the charges in December 1996, receiving 20-year sentences.

Alami and Botmeh have maintained their innocence; Amnesty International stated that Botmeh had been &quot;denied [his] right to a fair trial&quot;. Numerous groups and individuals campaigned on behalf of the pair, including the government of Palestine, Amnesty International, Unison (Britain&#x27;s largest trade union), human rights activist Gareth Peirce, investigative journalist Paul Foot, and Miscarriages of JusticeUK (MOJUK), Support for Alami and Botmeh&#x27;s appeal attracted cross-party support in Parliament – five early day motions raised by John Austin MP were supported by a total of 71 Members of Parliament, including Labour Party MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, Conservative Party MPs Peter Bottomley and Robert Jackson, and Liberal Democrats Tom Brake and Colin Breed. Beyond the early day motions, further support for a review of the conviction by parliamentarians included Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar and Harry Cohen.

The pair&#x27;s appeal against their convictions came to an end when their case was dismissed by the European Court of Human Rights in 2007. Upon review of the evidence, the court concluded that their right to a fair trial had not been infringed.

Following Botmeh&#x27;s release from prison in 2008 he found work as a researcher at the London Metropolitan University. He was suspended from work on 7 February 2013, having become an activist for his trade union, Unison; they have pointed out that his suspension was related to his election as a staff representative, and that he had declared his conviction for involvement in two car bombs at the Israeli Embassy prior to appointment. His suspension was lifted in March 2015.

<text>Farman Gurban oghlu Salmanov (; ; July 28, 1931, Morul – March 31, 2007, Moscow) was an Azerbaijani geologist known for discovering extensive oil fields in Western Siberia in Tyumen Oblast in 1961.

==Biography==
Farman Salmanov was born in the village of Morul of Shamkir District of Azerbaijan SSR in a family of farmers of Azerbaijani origin. After graduating from school with honors, he entered the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute and upon graduation was sent to explore oil in Kuzbass. He soon realized that there was no oil in Kuzbass, and decided to move with volunteers from his exploration team to Surgut in Siberia without the consent of the Soviet authorities. According to the doctrine prevailing at the time in the Soviet geological science Siberia was not considered an oil-bearing region. The authorities tried to initiate criminal prosecution of Salmanov, but had to give a post factum approval of his mission when his team threatened they would go on strike.

Salmanov struck oil on March 21, 1961, in the Megion field. He sent all his opponents similar telegrams: &quot;Dear comrade, an oil fountain is gushing from the depth of 2,180 meters in Megion. Is it clear?&quot; His opponents in the Soviet Ministry of Geology said that it was a natural anomaly and that the oil fountain would soon exhaust. When Salmanov struck the second oil reserve in Ust-Balyk, he sent a telegram to the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev: &quot;I found oil. That&#x27;s it.&quot; The Soviet leaders realized the importance of Salmanov&#x27;s discoveries, and Siberian oil soon became the main driving force of Soviet economy and a primary source of hard currency for the Soviet budget.

Farman Salmanov spent fifty years in the oil-and-gas industry of the Soviet Union and Russia, and discovered or participated in the discovery of over one hundred fields, including such huge oil and gas reserves as Mamontovskoye, Megionskoye, Pravdinskoye, Ust-Balykskoye, Surgutskoye, Urengoyskoye, Yamburgskoye, etc. He was awarded the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor in 1966 and the Lenin Prize in 1970. From 1978 to 1987 Salmanov headed the &quot;Glavtyumengeology&quot; after Y.G. Ervier, an organization in charge of oil and gas exploration in Tyumen Oblast. In 1987–1991 he was the first deputy to the Minister of Geology of the USSR. Until his death, Salmanov was an adviser to the president of Russian Itera Gas Company. Farman Salmanov was doctor of geological-mineralogical sciences, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the author of over 160 monographs and scientific works. He was an honorary citizen of Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs, the city of Surgut, and the state of Texas. A number of feature and documentary films were dedicated to Salmanov&#x27;s story.

Farman Salmanov died on March 31, 2007. He was buried in Moscow at the Vagankovo Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
Materials on the life and work of Salmanov are kept in museums of the Tyumen Region and the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area in Surgut.

In 2008, the youth scientific-practical conference, held by the Siberian Scientific Analytical Center, Tyumen, was named Salman Readings.

In memory of Farman Salmanov, monuments and busts were opened in Moscow, Baku, Surgut, Salekhard, Khanty-Mansiysk.

A street in Surgut, Nizhnevartovsk, an oil and gas condensate field and a motor ship was named in honor of Salmanov.

The name Farman Salmanov was assigned to the Tu-154M aircraft of UTair airlines, then to the Boeing 737-800 aircraft of the same company.

On August 29, 2013, a memorial board dedicated to Farman Salmanov was opened in Tyumen. The author of the memorial plaque, made of tinted bronze, is a member of the Union of Artists of Russia Zaur Rzayev.

In December 2018, it was announced that Surgut International Airport in Western Siberia would be named after Salmanov. This was the result of a nationwide vote on airport names across the country.

<doc id="693404" wikidata="Q1376011" url="?curid=693404" title="Fabian strategy">
<text>The Fabian strategy is a military strategy where pitched battles and frontal assaults are avoided in favor of wearing down an opponent through a war of attrition and indirection. While avoiding decisive battles, the side employing this strategy harasses its enemy through skirmishes to cause attrition, disrupt supply and affect morale. Employment of this strategy implies that the side adopting this strategy believes time is on its side, usually because the side employing the strategy is fighting in, or close to, their homeland and the enemy is far from home and by necessity has long and costly supply lines. It may also be adopted when no feasible alternative strategy can be devised.

By extension, the term is also applied to other situations in which a large, ambitious goal is seen as being out of reach, but may be accomplished in little steps.

== Rome versus Carthage: The Second Punic War ==

This strategy derives its name from Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, the dictator of the Roman Republic given the task of defeating the great Carthaginian general Hannibal in southern Italy during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). At the start of the war, Hannibal boldly crossed the Alps and invaded Italy. Due to his skill as a general, Hannibal repeatedly inflicted devastating losses on the Romans—quickly achieving two crushing victories over Roman armies at Trebia in 218 BC and Lake Trasimene in 217 BC. After these disasters, the Romans gave full authority to Fabius Maximus as dictator. Fabius initiated a war of attrition, fought through constant skirmishes, limiting the ability of the Carthaginians to forage for food and denying them significant victories.

Hannibal was handicapped by being a commander of an invading foreign army (on Italian soil), and was effectively cut off from his home country in North Africa due to the difficulty of seaborne resupply over the Mediterranean Sea. As long as Rome&#x27;s allies remained loyal, there was little he could do to win. Hannibal tried to convince the allies of Rome that it was more beneficial for them to side with Carthage (through a combination of victory and negotiation). Fabius calculated that, in order to defeat Hannibal, he had to avoid engaging him altogether (so as to deprive him of victories). He determined that Hannibal&#x27;s largely extended supply lines (as well as the cost of maintaining the Carthaginian army in the field) meant that Rome had time on its side.

Fabius avoided battle as a deliberate strategy. He sent out small military units to attack Hannibal&#x27;s foraging parties while keeping the Roman army in hilly terrain to nullify Carthaginian cavalry superiority. Residents of small villages in the path of the Carthaginians were ordered by Fabius to burn their crops creating scorched earth and take refuge in fortified towns. Fabius used interior lines to ensure that Hannibal could not march directly on Rome without having to first abandon his Mediterranean ports (supply lines). At the same time, Fabius began to inflict constant, small, debilitating defeats on the Carthaginians. This, Fabius had concluded, would wear down the invaders&#x27; endurance and discourage Rome&#x27;s allies from switching sides, without challenging the Carthaginians to major battles. Once the Carthaginians were sufficiently weakened and demoralized by lack of food and supplies, Fabius and his well-fed legions would then fight a decisive battle in the hope of crushing the Carthaginians once and for all.

Hannibal&#x27;s second weakness was that much of his army was made up of Spanish mercenaries and Gaulish allies. Their loyalty to Hannibal was shallow; though they disliked Rome, they mainly desired quick battles and raids for plunder. They were unsuited for long sieges, and possessed neither the equipment nor the patience for such tactics. The tedium of countless small-skirmish defeats sapped their morale, causing them to desert.

With no main Roman army to attack, Hannibal&#x27;s army became virtually no threat to Rome, which was a walled city that required a long siege to take. Fabius&#x27;s strategy struck at the heart of Hannibal&#x27;s weakness. Time, not major battles, would cripple Hannibal.

=== Political opposition ===

Fabius&#x27;s strategy, though a military success and tolerable to wiser minds in the Roman Senate, was unpopular; the Romans had been long accustomed to facing and besting their enemies directly on the field of battle. The Fabian strategy was, in part, ruined because of a lack of unity in the command of the Roman army. The magister equitum, Marcus Minucius Rufus, a political enemy of Fabius, famously exclaiming:

Are we come here to see our allies butchered, and their property burned, as a spectacle to be enjoyed? And if we are not moved with shame on account of any others, are we not on account of these citizens... which now not the neighboring Samnite wastes with fire, but a Carthaginian foreigner, who has advanced even this far from the remotest limits of the world, through our dilatoriness and inactivity?
As the memory of the shock of Hannibal&#x27;s victories grew dimmer, the Roman populace gradually started to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, the very thing which had given them time to recover. It was especially frustrating to the mass of the people, who were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. Moreover, it was widely believed that if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, the allies, believing that Rome was incapable of protecting them, might defect to the Carthaginians.

Since Fabius won no large-scale victories, the Senate removed him from command in 216 BC. Their chosen replacement, Gaius Terentius Varro, led the Roman army into a debacle at the Battle of Cannae. The Romans, after experiencing this catastrophic defeat and losing countless other battles, had by this point learned their lesson. They utilized the strategies that Fabius had taught them, which, they finally realized, were the only feasible means of driving Hannibal from Italy.

This strategy of attrition earned Fabius the cognomen &quot;Cunctator&quot; (The Delayer).

== Later examples ==
During Antony&#x27;s Atropatene campaign, the Parthians first destroyed the isolated baggage train and siege engines of the invaders. As Antony proceeded to lay siege on the Atropatenian capital, they began harassing the besiegers, forcing them to retreat.

During the Hanzhong Campaign in 219 AD, one year before the fall of ancient China&#x27;s Han dynasty, the warlord Liu Bei and his strategist Fa Zheng captured strategic locations from the forces of the rival warlord Cao Cao, resulting in the death of one of Cao Cao&#x27;s top generals, Xiahou Yuan. Cao Cao attempted to recapture those locations but Liu Bei&#x27;s forces refused to engage. 

Nearly a decade later, the Fabian strategy was used by Sima Yi as part of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Northern campaigns. Zhuge Liang&#x27;s campaigns had some success but often lacked supplies to capitalise on gains. By the time of the fifth expedition (234 AD), Sima Yi maintained a defensive stance and did not engage Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Shu troops. Zhuge Liang fell ill while trying to push through the defensive lines and died at the Wuzhang Plains that same year. 

During the Roman campaign against Persia prosecuted by Julian in 363 AD, the main Persian army under Shapur II let the numerically superior Romans advance deep into their territory, avoiding a full-scale battle at the expense of the destruction of their fortresses. As the fortified Persian capital seemed impregnable, Julian was lured into Persia&#x27;s interior, where the Persians employed scorched earth tactics. Shapur II&#x27;s army appeared later and engaged in continuous skirmishes only after the starving Romans were in retreat, resulting in a disastrous Roman defeat.

The Fabian strategy was used by King Robert the Bruce in combination with scorched earth tactics in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English after the disastrous defeats at the Battle of Dunbar, Battle of Falkirk, and Battle of Methven. Eventually King Robert was able to regain the entire kingdom of Scotland which had been conquered by the English.

The strategy was used by the medieval French general Bertrand du Guesclin during the Hundred Years&#x27; War against the English following a series of disastrous defeats in pitched battles against Edward, the Black Prince. Eventually du Guesclin was able to recover most of the territory that had been lost.

During the Italian Wars, after a first defeat in pitched battle in Seminara, Spanish general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba used Fabian tactics to retake southern Italy from Charles VIII of France&#x27;s army, compelling the French to withdraw after the Siege of Atella. Despite his success, he took to reform his army in pike and shot manner.

The most noted use of Fabian strategy in American history was by George Washington, sometimes called the &quot;American Fabius&quot; for his use of the strategy during the first year of the American Revolutionary War. While Washington had initially pushed for traditional direct engagements using battle lines, he was convinced of the merits of using his army to harass the British rather than engage them, both by the urging of his generals in his councils of war, and by the pitched-battle disasters of 1776, especially the Battle of Long Island. In addition, given his background as a colonial officer who had participated in asymmetric campaigns against Native Americans, Washington predicted that this style would aid in defeating the traditional tactics of the British Army (his predictions were proven correct). John Adams&#x27; dissatisfaction with Washington&#x27;s conduct of the war led him to declare, &quot;I am sick of Fabian systems in all quarters.&quot;

Throughout history, the Fabian strategy has been employed all over the world. Used against Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée in combination with scorched earth and guerrilla war, it proved decisive in defeating the French invasion of Russia. Sam Houston effectively employed a Fabian defense in the aftermath of the Battle of the Alamo, using delaying tactics and small-unit harrying against Santa Anna&#x27;s much larger force, to give time for the Army of Texas to grow into a viable fighting force. When he finally met Santa Anna at San Jacinto, the resulting victory ensured the establishment of the Republic of Texas. During the First World War in German East Africa, Generals Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and Jan Smuts both used the Fabian strategy in their campaigns.

During the First Indochina War, the Viet Minh used the strategy by utilizing delaying and hit-and-run tactics and scorched-earth strategy against the better-equipped French forces, which prolonged the war and caused both the French high command and home front to grow weary of the fighting, ending with the decisive Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu. The Viet Cong and the PAVN would later use this strategy against the Americans and ARVN forces during the Vietnam War.

There are some indications that the Ukraine strategy in the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a war of attrition.

== Fabian socialism ==
Fabian socialism, the ideology of the Fabian Society (founded in 1884), significantly influenced the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. It utilizes the same strategy of a &quot;war of attrition&quot; to facilitate the society&#x27;s aim to bring about a socialist state. The advocation of gradualism distinguished this brand of socialism from those who favor revolutionary action.

<doc id="693414" wikidata="Q7871092" url="?curid=693414" title="USS La Salle (AP-102)">
<text>The first USS &quot;La Salle&quot; (AP-102) of the United States Navy was the lead ship of her class of transport ships in use during the latter part of World War II.

The ship was laid down on 29 April 1942 under Maritime Commission contract as the Type C2 ship SS &quot;Hotspur&quot; by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, launched on 2 August 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Naomi S. Kehoe, acquired by the Navy on 18 March 1943, and commissioned as &quot;Hotspur&quot; on 31 March 1943.

==Service history==
Renamed &quot;La Salle&quot; on 6 April 1943, she left Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California on 14 April with Seabees for Guadalcanal, returning to San Francisco on 10 July. On 7 August, she departed from Port Hueneme, California, carrying contingents of United States Navy Argus Units 7,8 and 9, the Ninth Special Construction Battalion and the Fifth Special Medical Unit all bound for operations in the South Pacific. From there she steamed to Wellington, New Zealand, arriving on 27 October. There and in the New Hebrides, she conducted simulated attacks and landing boat exercises with marines in preparation for the assault on Tarawa, for which she sailed on 13 November with Task Force 53. She arrived off the invasion beaches on 19 November, and was shelled by enemy shore batteries early the next morning, suffering no serious damage. She cleared Tarawa the 24th and steamed to San Diego, where she arrived on 13 December to prepare for the invasion of the Marshalls.

&quot;La Salle&quot; left the west coast on 13 January 1944 and arrived off Kwajalein eight days later to land men of the 4th Marine Division. &quot;La Salle&quot; left the atoll on 8 February for Pearl Harbor, then later made several reinforcement movements.

From Pearl Harbor she sailed on 11 May with troops for the invasion of the Marianas, arriving on D-Day, 15 June to witness the pre-invasion bombardment before landing her marines. She retired from the battle zone on 23 June and reached Pearl Harbor on 24 July. She then proceeded to Guadalcanal in August where rehearsals for the capture of the Palaus ended on 8 September. She arrived off the Palaus on 15 September and made a feinting attack to keep enemy troops occupied in the northern islands during the attack on Peleliu itself. She landed her troops on the beaches of Angaur the 17th and departed on 23 September for Manus, where she embarked 1,373 troops of the Army 1st Cavalry Division for the Leyte invasion.

&quot;La Salle&quot; reached the northern transport area off Leyte on 20 October, and all troops and cargo were ashore by nightfall. She retired to the Palaus and then to Guam, where she embarked reinforcements for transport to San Pedro Bay on 23 November. The vessel next loaded 934 troops at Sansapor, New Guinea, and sailed on 30 December for Luzon. On the morning of her departure, she assisted in shooting down an enemy &quot;Jake&quot;. She unloaded on 9 January at Lingayen Gulf, and then returned to Leyte.

On 29 January 1945 she arrived off Luzon to discharge 731 troops in order to block Japanese retirement into the Bataan Peninsula. She departed the same day and put into San Pedro Bay on 1 February to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa, off which she arrived from Ulithi on 11 April. She fought off heavy suicide attacks during the next five days, and retired unscathed on 16 April, steaming for Guam and a Seattle overhaul.

Between September 1945 and June 1946, &quot;La Salle&quot; made four &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; voyages, and one passage in January to deliver occupation troops to Yokosuka. She decommissioned at Seattle on 24 July 1946 and was returned to the Maritime Commission the following day.

&quot;La Salle&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="693423" wikidata="Q4653043" url="?curid=693423" title="Answer Me!">
<text>Answer Me! (typically rendered ANSWER Me!) was a magazine edited by Jim Goad and Debbie Goad and published between 1991 and 1994. It focused on the social pathologies of interest to the Los Angeles–based couple.

&quot;Answer Me!&quot; also featured illustrations by racist antisemitic cartoonist Nick Bougas.

Issue 4 of &quot;Answer Me!&quot; was the subject of a high-profile obscenity trial against two booksellers whose magazine store carried the issue.

==Issues==

===Issue No. 1===
Released 31 October 1991.

Featured interviews with Russ Meyer, Timothy Leary, Holly Woodlawn, Kid Frost, Public Enemy, Iceberg Slim, and pieces on Bakersfield, California, Sunset Boulevard, masturbation in literature, and Twelve-Step programs.

===Issue No. 2===
Released 17 July 1992.

Featured Anton LaVey, David Duke, Al Goldstein, El Duce of The Mentors, the Geto Boys, Ray Dennis Steckler, 100 serial killers and mass murderers, Vietnamese gangs, and Mexican murder magazines.

===Issue No. 3===
Released 19 July 1993.

Featured Jack Kevorkian, Al Sharpton, NAMBLA, the Kids of Widney High, Boyd Rice, Suzanne Muldowney, 100 suicides, guns, Andrei Chikatilo, pedophilia in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s work, Mexican deformity comics, paintings and drawings by murderers, and a prank call to a suicide hotline.

===Issue No. 4===
Released 1994.

Known as &quot;The Rape Issue&quot;, features a teen-mag-style interview with Richard Ramirez, Donny the Punk, work by Molly Kiely, Boyd Rice, Randall Phillip, Shaun Partridge, Adam Parfrey (on Andrea Dworkin), Peter Sotos (with illustrations by Trevor Brown), pieces on amputation, the police, racist country &amp; western music, and &quot;Chocolate Impulse&quot;.

===The book===
The first three issues were released in a collection with autobiographical introductory pieces by Debbie and Jim. It was first published as &quot;Answer Me!: The First Three&quot; () by AK Press.

It was reissued, along with 60 pages of new material, by Scapegoat Publishing () in 2006.

According to Jim Goad&#x27;s website , a collection of issues #1–4 &quot;will be reprinted this year.&quot;

== Controversy ==
In 1995, a complaint about issue no. 4 being sold at a Bellingham, Washington magazine store known as The Newsstand resulted in owners Ira Stohl and Kristina Hjelsand being tried on charges of distribution of obscenity. Charged with one felony count of promoting pornography, they faced a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. The defendants were found not guilty. A later lawsuit against the City of Bellingham by Stohl and Hjelsand resulted in the City paying $1.3 million to the plaintiffs on the grounds of violation of First Amendment rights and infliction of emotional distress.

==&quot;Chocolate Impulse&quot;==
&quot;Chocolate Impulse&quot; was a &quot;hoax zine&quot; created by Jim and Debbie Goad, publishers of &quot;Answer Me!&quot;. Wanting to address the negative feedback they&#x27;d received from the zine community, the Goads wrote and distributed a pseudonymous screed against themselves (in which they claimed to be the lesbian couple &quot;Valerie Chocolate&quot; and &quot;Faith Impulse&quot;), going so far as to set up a fake address for it in Kentucky. The zine received some positive response from the publishers of &quot;Feminist Baseball&quot; and other zines that had negatively reviewed the Goads. In issue #4 of &quot;Answer Me!&quot;, Jim Goad revealed the prank and insulted those who had taken the bait.

As a driver he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the Indianapolis 500 in 2004 and 2020 as team owner for Buddy Rice and Takuma Sato, respectively.

After retiring as a driver, Rahal held managerial positions with the Jaguar Formula 1 team and also was an interim president of the CART series. Rahal was also a sports car driver during the 1980s, and made one NASCAR start for the Wood Brothers.

==Racing career==

Rahal began his career in SCCA feeder categories, eventually finishing second to Gilles Villeneuve in the 1977 Formula Atlantic championship. The following year, he competed in the 1978 New Zealand Grand Prix with Fred Opert Racing (Formula Pacific) and in European Formula Three with Wolf Racing. Near the end of the season, Rahal raced for the Wolf Formula 1 team in the 1978 United States Grand Prix and the 1978 Canadian Grand Prix. The deal with Wolf did not continue into the 1979 season, as Wolf signed up James Hunt for the one and only car available. Rahal began the 1979 racing a Chevron in Formula Two, but returned to America mid-season and raced in the Can-Am series. During the next few seasons, he competed in various sports car events, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the IMSA GT Championship.

In 1982, Rahal entered the CART Indy car series with the Truesports team, winning two races and finishing second in the championship behind Rick Mears. He continued racing for Truesports through the 1988 season, winning at least one race every year. In 1986, Rahal dramatically passed Kevin Cogan on a restart with two laps to go to win the Indianapolis 500, only days before his team owner, Jim Trueman died of cancer. Later that year, Rahal won his first CART championship, and successfully defended it the following year.

In 1988, Rahal won the last race the Truesports team ever won, the Quaker State 500 at Pocono, the first and only Indy car victory for the Judd engine.

During his CART career, Rahal also won races in IMSA and IROC. By 1989, Rahal had ended his occasional forays into sports car racing and focused solely on CART. He moved over to the Kraco race team, but this association produced only two wins over three seasons.

Rahal competed in one NASCAR race in his career. In November 1984 he drove the 7-11 sponsored Wood Brothers #21 Ford (substituting for Buddy Baker) to a 40th-place finish in the Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Speedway, completing only 44 laps before breaking a rear end gear.

==IndyCar owner==

After losing the championship to Michael Andretti in 1991, Rahal (with partner Carl Hogan) acquired the assets to the former Pat Patrick Racing team, with Rahal becoming an owner-driver. The team was an immediate success in 1992, producing four wins for Rahal and his third CART championship, making him the last owner-driver to win the CART title, and the last driver to win a race with his own team until Adrian Fernandez did so in 2003. In 1993, Rahal attempted to develop his own Rahal-Hogan chassis, but reverted to the Lola chassis after failing to qualify for the 1993 Indianapolis 500. In 1994 the team brought the Honda engine into the CART series. Except for a second-place finish at Toronto, he and teammate Mike Groff struggled to show the full potential of an engine that would soon dominate the series. In 1995 at Long Beach Rahal became the 10th driver in Championship Car history (including AAA, USAC, and CART) to start 200 races in his career. Despite no wins, Rahal finished a strong 3rd in the 1995 standings using the Mercedes engine.

Rahal continued as a racing driver until his retirement in 1998. Meanwhile, Hogan left to form his own team and talk show host David Letterman became a minority owner in 1996. The team became known as Team Rahal in 1996 and Rahal Letterman Racing in 2004, when Rahal switched from CART to the IRL full-time.

==Other business roles==
In 2000, Rahal joined the Jaguar Formula One team in a managerial capacity. During this time, Rahal attempted to hire championship-winning aerodynamicist Adrian Newey, briefly believing that the deal had been completed, but was unsuccessful. However, Rahal was fired after reportedly attempting to sell driver Eddie Irvine to rivals Jordan. Ironically, the team fired Irvine little more than a year after firing Rahal, while Newey joined in 2006, a year after the team was sold to Red Bull.

Rahal was the interim President and CEO of CART for six months during the 2000 season.

His business interests include Bobby Rahal Automotive Group, a network of car dealerships in western and central Pennsylvania selling Acura, BMW, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo.

In 2021, Rahal began to venture into race promoting with the help of former IndyCar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George. Rahal&#x27;s first move in race promotion was to return the popular Iowa Speedway round to IndyCar after it had been left off of the 2021 calendar. Rahal was able to recruit Iowa supermarket chain Hy-Vee as a sponsor and secured a multi year agreement between IndyCar and Iowa Speedway to run a double header event at the track starting in 2022.

==Tribute==
At WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, the back straight leading up to the corkscrew was named the &quot;Rahal Straight&quot; in his honor.

==Personal life==
He is the son of Barbara and Michael Rahal (1924-2017) who raced autos for over two decades. His father is of Lebanese descent and his mother is of English descent. His father owned a wholesale food distribution business. Rahal was raised in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn and attended Glenbard West High School as class of 1971. Rahal is a graduate of Denison University, where his father also graduated.

Rahal formerly lived in New Albany, Ohio. He now lives in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. His son is Graham Rahal, who races in the IndyCar Series.

Rahal owns a 1975 Lola T360 which he occasionally races at vintage racing events.

In 2023, Rahal had knee surgery which he is currently recovering from.

<text>The Airspeed AS.51 Horsa was a British troop-carrying glider used during the Second World War. It was developed and manufactured by Airspeed Limited, alongside various subcontractors; the type was named after Horsa, the legendary 5th-century conqueror of southern Britain.

Having been greatly impressed by the effective use of airborne operations by Germany during the early stages of the Second World War, such as during the Battle of France, the Allied powers sought to establish capable counterpart forces of their own. The British War Office, determining that the role of gliders would be an essential component of such airborne forces, proceeded to examine available options. An evaluation of the General Aircraft Hotspur found it to lack the necessary size, thus Specification &quot;X.26/40&quot; was issued. It was from this specification that Airspeed Limited designed the Horsa, a large glider capable of accommodating up to 30 fully equipped troops, which was designated as the &quot;AS 51&quot;.

The Horsa was used in large numbers by the British Army Air Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF); both services used it to conduct various air assault operations through the conflict. The type was used to perform an unsuccessful attack on the German heavy water plant at Rjukan in Norway, known as Operation Freshman, and during the invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky. Large numbers of Horsas were subsequently used during the opening stages of the Battle of Normandy, being used in the British Operation Tonga and American operations. It was also deployed in quantity during Operation Dragoon, Operation Market Garden, and Operation Varsity. Further use of the Horsa was made by various other armed forces, including the United States Army Air Forces.

==Development==
===Background===
In the early stages of the Second World War, the German military demonstrated its role as a pioneer in the deployment of airborne operations. These forces had conducted several successful operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the use of glider-borne troops during the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Having been impressed by the performance and capabilities of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided that they would also form their own airborne formation. As a result of this decision, the creation of two British airborne divisions came about, as well as smaller-scale units. On 22 June 1940, the British airborne establishment was formally initiated when the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. During 1941, the United States also embarked on a similar programme.

While the equipment for the airborne forces was under development, it was decided by War Office officials that gliders would be an integral component of such a force. It was initially thought that gliders would be used to deliver paratroops. Transport aircraft would both carry paratroops and tow a glider with a second party of troops. The idea arose as a response to the severe shortage of transport aircraft in the early part of the war, as in this way the number of troops that could be dropped in an operation by a given number of transport aircraft would be greatly enhanced. The empty gliders would be towed back to base.

However, thinking eventually evolved into using gliders to land both troops and heavy equipment in the theatre of operations. The first glider produced was the General Aircraft Hotspur, which first flew on 5 November 1940. Several problems were found with the Hotspur&#x27;s design, the worst being its inability to carry sufficient troops. It was believed that airborne troops should be landed in larger groups than the eight that the Hotspur could carry, and that the number of towplanes required would prove to be impractical. There were also concerns that the gliders would have to be towed in tandem, which would be extremely hazardous at night or through cloud.

Accordingly, it was decided that the Hotspur would be used only as a training glider, while British industry continued with the development of several different gliders, including a larger 25-seater assault glider, which would become the &quot;Airspeed Horsa&quot;. On 12 October 1940, Specification &quot;X.26/40&quot; was issued, calling for a large assault glider. The specification required the use of wood where possible to conserve critical supplies of metal. Airspeed would designate the Horsa the &quot;AS.51&quot;.

Airspeed assembled a team headed by aircraft designer Hessell Tiltman whose efforts began at the de Havilland technical school at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, before relocating to Salisbury Hall, London Colney. The Horsa was to have had paratroopers jumping from doors on either side of the fuselage, while the glider remained under tow, while combat landings would have been secondary. The widely set doors enabled simultaneous egress, as well as for troops to fire on nearby enemies while still in the glider. For this they were provided with several firing points in the roof and tail. That idea was dropped, and it was decided that the glider would simply land troops.

===Production===
In February 1941, an initial order was placed for 400 gliders and it was estimated that Airspeed should be able to complete the order by July 1942. Early on, inquiries were made into the possibility of a further 400 being manufactured in India for the use of Indian airborne forces, however, this plan was abandoned when it was discovered the required wood would have to be imported into India. Seven prototypes were ordered with Fairey Aircraft producing the first two prototypes, which were used for flight testing, while Airspeed completed the remaining prototypes that were used in equipment and loading tests. On 12 September 1941, the first prototype (DG597), towed by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, made its first flight, 11 months after the specification was issued.
As specified in Specification &quot;X3/41&quot;, 200 &quot;AS 52&quot; Horsas were also to be constructed to carry bombs. A central fuselage bomb bay holding four or two bombs was fitted into the standard Horsa fuselage. The concept of towing bombs was dropped as other bombers became available, resulting in the order for the AS 52 being cancelled.

In early 1942, production of the Horsa commenced; by May 1942, some 2,345 had been ordered by the Army for use in future airborne operations. The glider was designed from the outset to be constructed using components and a series of 30 sub-assemblies required to complete the manufacturing process. Manufacturing was intended primarily to use woodcrafting facilities, which were not needed for more urgent aviation production, and as a result, production was spread across separate factories, which consequently limited the likely loss in case of German attack. The designer A. H. Tiltman said that the Horsa &quot;went from the drawing board to the air in ten months, which was not too bad considering the drawings had to be made suitable for the furniture trade who were responsible for all production.&quot;

The initial 695 gliders were manufactured at Airspeed&#x27;s factory in Christchurch, Hampshire; production of the remainder was performed by an assortment of subcontractors. These included Austin Motors, and a production group coordinated by the furniture manufacturers Harris Lebus. These same contractors would produce an improved model of the glider, designated as the &quot;AS.53 Horsa Mk II&quot;, while none would be manufactured by Airspeed themselves. The Horsa Mk II had been specifically designed for the carriage of vehicles, featuring a reinforced floor and a hinged nose section in order to accommodate such use. Other changes included the adoption of a twin nosewheel arrangement, a modified tow attachment and an increased all-up weight of .

As a consequence of the majority of subcontractors not having available airfields from which to deliver the gliders, they sent the sub-assemblies to RAF Maintenance Units (MUs), who would perform final assembly themselves; this process has been attributed as being responsible for the widely varying production numbers recorded of the type. Between 3,655 and 3,799 Horsas had been completed by the time production ended.

==Design==

The Airspeed AS.51 Horsa was a large troop-carrying glider. It was capable of transporting a maximum of 30 seated fully equipped troops; it also had the flexibility to carry a Jeep or an Ordnance QF 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The Horsa Mark I had a wingspan of and a length of , and when fully loaded weighed . The later &quot;AS 58 Horsa II&quot; featured an increased fully loaded weight of along with a hinged nose section, reinforced floor and double nose wheels to support the extra weight of vehicles. The tow cable was attached to the nose wheel strut, rather than the dual wing points of the Horsa I. The Horsa was composed largely of wood; it was described by aviation author H. A. Taylor as being: &quot;the most wooden aircraft ever built. Even the controls in the cockpit were masterpieces of the woodworker&#x27;s skill&quot;.

It was considered to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot&#x27;s compartment and main freight loading door, the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.

The fuselage joint at the rear end of the main section could be broken on landing to facilitate the rapid unloading of troops and equipment, for which ramps were provided. Initially the tail was severed by detonating a ring of Cordtex around the rear fuselage. But this was thought to be hazardous, especially if detonated prematurely by enemy fire. In early 1944, a method of detaching the tail was devised that used eight quick-release bolts, and wire-cutters to sever the control cables.

The wing carried large &quot;barn door&quot; flaps which, when lowered, made a steep, high rate-of-descent landing possible—this performance would allow the pilots to land in constricted spaces. By employing a combination of the flaps and pneumatic brakes, the glider could be brought to a stop within relatively short distances. The Horsa was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear and it was one of the first gliders equipped with a tricycle undercarriage for take off. On operational flights, the main gear could be jettisoned and landing was then made on the castoring nose wheel and a sprung skid set on the underside of the fuselage.

The pilot&#x27;s compartment had two side-by-side seats and dual controls, all of which being contained within a large Plexiglas nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which had the advantage of being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot&#x27;s compartment was the freight loading door on the port side; the hinged door could also be used as a loading ramp. The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another access door on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.

During March 1942, the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment and 1st Airlanding Brigade commenced loading trials using several of the prototypes, but immediately ran into problems. During an attempt to load a jeep into a prototype, Airspeed personnel present informed the evaluation staff that to do so would break the glider&#x27;s loading ramp, as it had been designed to hold only a single motorbike. With this lesson learnt, 1st Airlanding Brigade subsequently began sending samples of all equipment required to go into Horsas to Airspeed, and several weeks were spent ascertaining the methods and modifications required to fit the equipment into a Horsa. Even so, the loading ramp continued to be considered to be fragile and prone to damage, which would ground the glider if sustained during loading.

==Operational history==
===Wartime use===
The Horsa was first deployed operationally on the night of 19/20 November 1942 in the unsuccessful attack on the German heavy water plant at Rjukan in Norway (Operation Freshman). The two Horsa gliders, each carrying 15 sappers, and one of the Halifax tug aircraft crashed in Norway due to bad weather. All 23 survivors from the glider crashes were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler, in breach of the Geneva Convention which protects prisoners of war (POWs) from summary execution.

In preparation for further operational deployment, 30 Horsa gliders were air-towed by Halifax bombers from bases in Great Britain to North Africa; three of these aircraft were lost in transit. On 10 July 1943, the 27 surviving Horsas were used during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, which was the type&#x27;s first large-scale operation.

The Horsa was deployed in large numbers (estimated to be in excess of 250) during the Battle of Normandy, in the British Operation Tonga and the American airborne landings in Normandy. The first unit to land in France during the battle was a British &quot;coup-de-main&quot; force, carried by six Horsas, that captured the Caen canal and Orne river bridges. During the opening phase of the operation, 320 Horsas were used to perform the first lift of the 6th Airborne Division; a further 296 Horsas participated in the second lift. Large numbers of both American and British forces were deployed using the Horsa during the opening phase of the battle.

The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) acquired approximately 400 Horsas in a form of reverse Lend-Lease. Capable of accommodating up to 30 troop seats, the Horsa was much bigger than the 13-troop American Waco CG-4A (known as the &quot;Hadrian&quot; by the British).

In British service, the Horsa was a major component during several major offensives that followed the successful Normandy landings, such as Operation Dragoon and Operation Market Garden, both in 1944, and Operation Varsity in March 1945. The latter was the final operation for the Horsa, and had involved a force of 440 gliders carrying soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division across the Rhine.

Operationally, the Horsa was towed by various aircraft: four-engined heavy bombers displaced from operational service such as the Short Stirling and Handley Page Halifax, the Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley twin-engined bombers, as well as the US Douglas C-47 Skytrain/Dakota (not as often due to the weight of the glider). In Operation Market Garden, a total of 1,336 C-47s along with 340 Stirlings were employed to tow 1,205 gliders,) and Curtiss C-46 Commando. The gliders were towed with a harness that attached to points on both wings and also carried an intercom between tug and glider. The glider pilots were usually from the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps (AAC), although Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots were used on occasion.

===Postwar use===
A small number of Horsa Mk IIs were obtained by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and participated in evaluation trials which were held at CFB Gimli, Manitoba. Three of these survivors were purchased as surplus in the early 1950s and ended up in Matlock, Manitoba, where they were scrapped. India also acquired a small number of Horsas for their own evaluation purposes. Due to low surplus prices in the UK, many were bought and converted into trailers, sheds and even holiday cottages.

On 5 June 2004, as part of the 60th anniversary commemoration of D-Day, Prince Charles unveiled a replica Horsa on the site of the first landing at Pegasus Bridge and talked with Jim Wallwork, the first pilot to land the aircraft on French soil during D-Day.

Ten replicas were built for the 1977 film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, mainly for static display and set-dressing, although one Horsa was modified to make a brief &quot;hop&quot; towed behind a Dakota at Deelen, the Netherlands. During the production, seven of the replicas were damaged in a wind storm; the contingent were repaired in time for use in the film. Five of the Horsa &quot;film models&quot; were destroyed during filming with the survivors sold as a lot to John Hawke, aircraft collector in the UK. Another mock-up for close-up work came into the possession of the Ridgeway Military &amp; Aviation Research Group and is stored at Welford, Berkshire.

==Surviving aircraft==

An Airspeed Horsa Mark II (KJ351) is preserved at the Museum of Army Flying in Hampshire, England. The Assault Glider Trust built a replica at RAF Shawbury using templates made from original components found scattered over various European battlefields and using plans supplied by BAE Systems (on the condition that the glider must not be flown). The replica was completed in 2014 and then stored at RAF Cosford until it was transferred to the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands in June 2019.

A fuselage section displayed at the Traces of War museum at Wolfheze, Netherlands, was retrieved from Cholsey, Oxfordshire, where it had served as a dwelling for over 50 years. It was recovered around 2001 by the de Havilland Aircraft Museum, of London Colney, where it was stored until being bought by museum owner Paul Hendriks. The airframe is believed not to have seen active service. A cockpit section is on display at the Silent Wings Museum in Lubbock, Texas.

BAPC.232 Horsa I/II Composite – Nose &amp; Fuselage sections is on display in the Walter Goldsmith Hangar at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. A full-sized replica stands close to Pegasus Bridge, Normandy, as part of the Memorial Pegasus museum.

<text>Albert Lee &quot;Buddy&quot; Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American former race car driver. He is best known for winning the 2004 Indianapolis 500 while driving for Rahal Letterman Racing, and the 2009 24 Hours of Daytona for Brumos Racing.

==Career==

===Early years===

Born in Phoenix, Arizona, Buddy Rice is the son of a former drag racer. Rice&#x27;s grandfather was from Indianapolis and passed on his interest in racing to Rice&#x27;s father. Rice saw his first race when he was six years old. He started racing in go-karts when he was 11. Rice played baseball in high school in Phoenix, Arizona, and attracted the attention of college and professional scouts. However, both Rice and his father decided he would pursue a career in racing instead.

Rice&#x27;s professional career began in 1996, when he drove in one U.S. F2000 event; he finished eighth after starting second. He also drove in the Dodge Shelby Pro Series, winning from the pole at Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1997, Rice drove in F2000 for Lynx Racing/DSTP Motorsports, finishing fourth in points and winning at Phoenix. He also won the 1997 Valvoline Team USA Scholarship, where he represented the United States in Europe’s &quot;Nations Cup&quot;.

In 1998, he won from the pole at Nazareth. He finished seventh in Toyota Atlantic points, and won the Gilles Villeneuve Memorial Award. He finished fifth in the Toyota Atlantic championship in 1999, driving for Lynx Racing.

He won the 2000 Toyota Atlantic Series championship, which gained the attention of Red Bull Cheever Racing. In 2001, he tested with Red Bull Cheever Racing in November at California.

===IRL IndyCar Series===
In August 2002, Rice had his first race in the IRL for Red Bull Cheever Racing at Michigan International Speedway. Hired initially to replace crash-prone Tomas Scheckter, team owner Eddie Cheever discovered that Scheckter&#x27;s contract was more iron-clad than first thought. Team Cheever then ran three entries (joined by their team owner), and the best crew and parts were given to Rice. Rice lost the race by inches to Scheckter, but made a mark in the series. He competed in the final five races of the IRL IndyCar Series season with Red Bull Cheever Racing, scoring four top-10 finishes and two top-five finishes in five starts.

In 2003, Rice competed in 13 of 16 races for Red Bull Cheever Racing but was replaced by the more experienced Alex Barron.

In November 2003, he dabbled with a one-off drive in a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at the Homestead circuit before being called by Bobby Rahal to drive the No. 15 Argent Mortgage Honda when Kenny Bräck was injured in a late-race crash at Texas Motor Speedway in 2003.
In 2004, Rice started on pole and won a rain-shortened Indianapolis 500, his first Indycar race victory. He finished 3rd in the IRL championship that year, earning five poles, three wins and leading 342 laps. After his Indy 500 win, his sponsors told him that they would buy him any car he wanted, he chose a 1949 Mercury Eight.

For 2005 he and Vítor Meira were joined by Danica Patrick. However, Rice was injured in a crash at Indianapolis during practice, and was not cleared to race. In an ironic twist, Bräck then substituted for Rice.

The 2006 season began tragically for Rice at the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway when teammate Paul Dana of Rahal Letterman Racing team was killed in the final practice session. Rice and his other teammate Danica Patrick immediately withdrew from the race. Rice started his 2006 season in the following race at St. Petersburg, Florida. His Indianapolis 500 race ended early in a crash with Hélio Castroneves. After the IRL season ended, he raced in the Champ Car World Series race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez for Forsythe Racing and finished 10th.
For 2007, Rice joined Sarah Fisher at Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing. He captured 3 top-five finishes in the first half of the season and finished 9th in points, his best result since 2004. He was retained by the team for the 2008 IndyCar season, the high point of which came with a 4th-place finish at Watkins Glen. He ultimately finished 16th in points.

He did not participate in the 2009 IndyCar Series season after being released from Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing at the end of the 2008 season. Further, his long-standing partnership with Red Bull also expired and was not renewed.

He raced for Panther Racing in the 2011 Indianapolis 500 as a teammate to J. R. Hildebrand driving the No. 44 Honda Dallara.

===A1 Grand Prix===
Starting the 2007-08 season, Rice signed to drive for A1 Team USA in the A1 Grand Prix international racing series. He drove in the first two rounds of the season with a best finish of 13th in the Zandvoort feature race before ceding the seat to Jonathan Summerton for the remainder of the season.

===Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series===

Rice competed in a few Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series in the early 2000s. In his debut in 2000, he finished second at Watkins Glen on a TRP Lola Nissan. In 2002 he resulted second at the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen and fourth in Homestead and Phoenix, driving a Miracle Riley &amp; Scott Ford.

The driver competed at the 24 Hours of Daytona from 2005 to 2008, with a best result of 9th in 2006. He also raced at Utah from 2006 to 2008, collecting a 7th again in 2006.

In 2009, Rice won the 24 Hours of Daytona on a Brumos Racing Riley Porsche. He spent the second half of the season as teammate of Antonio García in a Spirit of Daytona Coyote Porsche, where he finished 4th at Barber in his only top 10.

Rice raced full-time for Spirit of Daytona in the 2010 Rolex Sports Car Series, joining again García. He helped Spirit of Daytona get the first podium finish for the team at the Six Hours of the Glen in 2010, collecting a third place. He also resulted 5th in three races and ended the season in 11th place.

His last Grand-Am race was the 2011 24 Hours of Daytona, where he finished 9th in an Action Express Racing Riley Porsche.

==Personal==
In his free time, Rice collects and restores classic cars. He has a child, Mina, who was born on April 9, 2008.

<text>George Howard Herbig (January 2, 1920 – October 12, 2013) was an American astronomer at the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy. He is perhaps best known for his contribution to the discovery of Herbig–Haro objects.

==Background==
Born in 1920 in Wheeling, West Virginia, Herbig received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1948 at the University of California, Berkeley; his dissertation is titled &quot;A Study of Variable Stars in Nebulosity&quot;.

==Career==
His specialty was stars at an early stage of evolution (a class of intermediate mass pre–main sequence stars are named Herbig Ae/Be stars after him) and the interstellar medium. He was perhaps best known for his discovery, with Guillermo Haro, of the Herbig–Haro objects; bright patches of nebulosity excited by bipolar outflow from a star being born.

Herbig also made prominent contributions to the field of diffuse interstellar band (DIB) research, especially through a series of nine articles published between 1963 and 1995 entitled &quot;The diffuse interstellar bands.&quot;

<text>Globalization and Its Discontents is a book published in 2002 by the 2001 Nobel laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz. The title is a reference to Freud&#x27;s Civilization and Its Discontents.

The book draws on Stiglitz&#x27;s personal experience as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Bill Clinton from 1993 and chief economist at the World Bank from 1997. During this period Stiglitz became disillusioned with the IMF and other international institutions, which he came to believe acted against the interests of impoverished developing countries. Stiglitz argues that the policies pursued by the IMF are based on neoliberal assumptions that are fundamentally unsound:
Behind the free market ideology there is a model, often attributed to Adam Smith, which argues that market forces—the profit motive—drive the economy to efficient outcomes as if by an invisible hand. One of the great achievements of modern economics is to show the sense in which, and the conditions under which, Smith&#x27;s conclusion is correct. It turns out that these conditions are highly restrictive. Indeed, more recent advances in economic theory—ironically occurring precisely during the period of the most relentless pursuit of the Washington Consensus policies—have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly. Significantly, there are desirable government interventions which, in principle, can improve upon the efficiency of the market. These restrictions on the conditions under which markets result in efficiency are important—many of the key activities of government can be understood as responses to the resulting market failures.
Stiglitz argues that IMF policies contributed to bringing about the 1997 Asian financial crisis, as well as the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. Also noted was the failure of Russia&#x27;s conversion to a market economy and low levels of development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specific policies criticised by Stiglitz include fiscal austerity, high interest rates, trade liberalization, and the liberalization of capital markets and insistence on the privatization of state assets.

== Contents of the book ==

The theories which guide the IMF&#x27;s policies are empirically flawed. Free market, neoclassical, and neoliberal are all essentially euphemisms for the disastrous laissez-faire economics of the late 19th century. This approach seeks to minimize the role of government—arguing that lower wages solve problems of unemployment, and relying upon trickle-down economics (the belief that growth and wealth will trickle down to all segments of society) to address poverty. Stiglitz finds no evidence to support this belief, and considers the &#x27;Washington Consensus&#x27; policy of free markets to be a blend of ideology and bad science.

Joseph Stiglitz was awarded the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with George Akerlof and Michael Spence) for demonstrating how information affects markets. Without equal access to information between employer and employee, company and consumer, or (in the IMF&#x27;s case) lender and debtor, there is no chance of &quot;free&quot; markets operating efficiently. (This explanation also owes much to the earlier Nobel work of Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu.)

Stiglitz explains that globalization could be either success or failure, depending on its management. There is a success when it is managed by national government by embracing their characteristics of each individual country; however, there is a failure when it is managed by international institutions such as IMF.

Globalization is beneficial under the condition that the economic management operated by national government and the example is East Asian countries. Those countries (especially South Korea and Taiwan) were based on exports through which they were able to close technological, capital and knowledge gaps. By managing national pace of change and speed of liberalization on their own, those countries were able to achieve economic growth. The countries who received the benefits from the globalization shared their profits equally.

However, Stiglitz believes that if the national economy regulated by international institutions there could be an adverse effect. It is because the international institutions such as IMF, WTO, and World Bank lack transparency and accountability. Without government oversight, they reach decisions without public debate and resolve trade disputes involving &quot;uncompetitive&quot; or &quot;onerous&quot; environmental, labor, and capital laws in secret tribunals—without appeal to a nation&#x27;s courts.

In East Asia&#x27;s financial crisis, Russia&#x27;s failed conversion to a market economy, failed development in sub-Saharan Africa, and financial meltdown in Argentina, Stiglitz argues that IMF policies contributed to a disaster: It failed to promote productive investment opportunities and demand for credit of quality; only well-planned loans, based on high quality economic and sector work, lead to improved design, effective implementation, and lower cost. It is better to spend more time getting the program right than to lend prematurely. However, none of these were done. As a result, loans came with extensive conditions that subverted the growth of democracy, hampered local economic growth, and enriched multinational corporations.

To evaluate his conclusion, it is instructive to look at those cases where Third World development actually succeeded: South Asia and China are the world&#x27;s two greatest emerging markets. South Asia repeatedly resisted IMF conditions (especially South Korea and Malaysia) and China declined any IMF money whatsoever.

According to Stiglitz, IMF interventions all followed a similar free market formula. The IMF strongly advocated &quot;shock therapy&quot; in a rush to market economies, without first establishing institutions to protect the public and local commerce. Local social, political, and economic considerations were largely ignored. Privatization without land reform or strong competitive policies resulted in crony capitalism, large businesses run by organized crime, and neo-feudalism without a middle class. There is no doubt that monetary aid/lending could have an important and effective role in advocating country efforts to sustain external shocks and improve economic status but without strong forefront progress on the policy, the aid of balance of payments help could very well be counterproductive. The consequence will be escalated levels of debt, weakened policy credibility and a lot more difficult task of adjustment in the future.

The IMF also foisted premature capital market liberalization (free flow of capital) without institutional regulation of the financial sector. This destabilized entire developing economies by causing massive inflows of &#x27;hot&#x27; short-term investment capital; then when inflation rose, the IMF&#x27;s loan conditions imposed fiscal austerity and dramatically rising interest rates. This led to widespread bankruptcies without legal protection, massive unemployment without a social safety net, and the prompt withdrawal of foreign capital. The few remaining solvent owners, with zero opportunity for business growth, stripped assets for any value they could.

With loans defaulted and entire nations thrown into economic and social chaos, the IMF rushed bailouts directed mainly to foreign creditors. This fueled speculative runs on currency, and most of the bailout money soon wound up in Swiss and Caribbean bank accounts. As a result, Third World citizens carried much of the costs and few of the benefits of IMF loans, and a moral hazard ensued among the financial community: foreign creditors made bad loans, knowing that if the debtors defaulted, the IMF would pick up the tab (see Long Term Capital Management, whose overexposure in Southeast Asia might have brought down international financial markets without a massive bailout). Meanwhile, the IMF urged cash-strapped countries to further privatize—in effect selling their assets at a fraction of their value to raise cash. Foreign corporations then bought up the assets at rock-bottom prices.

Predictably, great resentment resulted from the IMF&#x27;s agenda.

Stabilization is on the agenda; job creation is not. Taxation, and its adverse effects, are on the agenda; land reform is off. There is money to bail out banks but not to pay for improved education and health services, let alone to bail out workers who are thrown out of their jobs as a result of the IMF&#x27;s macroeconomic mismanagement. Ordinary people as well as many government officials and business people continue to refer to the economic and social storm that hit their nations simply as &#x27;the IMF&#x27; — the way one would say &#x27;the plague&#x27; or &#x27;the Great Depression&#x27; [80-81, 97].

John Maynard Keynes helped conceive of the IMF as a fund to help developing countries grow at full employment. So why the consistent and disastrous failure to live up to this mandate?

The IMF is pursuing not just the objectives set out in its original mandate, of enhancing global stability and ensuring that there are funds for countries facing a threat of recession to pursue expansionary policies. It is also pursuing the interests of the financial community. This means that the IMF has objectives that are often in conflict with each other [206-7].

The global financial community apparently did not see the IMF&#x27;s track record as one of conflicted interests or consistent failure: IMF managing director Stanley Fischer and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin both left for multimillion-dollar jobs at Citigroup.

Stiglitz believes the IMF and World Bank should be reformed, not dismantled—with a growing population, malaria and AIDS pandemics, and global environmental challenges, Keynes&#x27; mandate for equitable growth is more urgent now than ever. He advocates a gradual, sequential, and selective approach to institutional development, land reform and privatization, capital market liberalization, competition policies, worker safety nets, health infrastructure, and education. Different countries will need to follow different paths. Selective policies would direct funds to programs and governments which had success in the past. He also points out &quot;global governance without global government,&quot; and suggests that we need to recognize the inequities of the &quot;global economic architecture.&quot; Based on the recognition, there is a need of rectification of the developed nations oriented imbalances, and should focus on developing nations. Lastly, democratic disciplines are needed to ensure that financial institutions serve general interests.

Debt forgiveness should be extended, building on the success of the Jubilee Movement. Since the IMF loans primarily benefited foreigners and government officials, he argues it is unjust and onerous that citizens of developing nations be heavily taxed to pay them off.

Not coincidentally, Stiglitz believes that promoting local and international democracy is fundamental to reforming global economic policy. Democracy aids social stability, empowers the free flow of information, and promotes a decentralized economy upon which efficient and equitable economies rely. Extending IMF and WTO voting rights to developing countries, along with public accountability, would be a good start. For Stiglitz, promoting democracy comes before promoting business.

==Global governance without global government==

Stiglitz argues current procedures for globalization is &quot;global governance without global government&quot;. Unlike states, which separation of powers exists, International financial institutions, IMF, WTO, and World Bank, lack any necessary checks and balances. Those international financial institutions are isolated and sole deciders of financial policies and enforce without hearing any dissenting opinions, generally developing countries. IMF’s reckless liberalization, privatization, and deregulation violate developing countries’ sovereignties. Thus rather than working for equity and extermination of poverty, financial institutions become spokespersons of the financial community. The procedures and rhetoric of financial institutions widen the gap between developed and developing, which resulted from undemocratic paternalism and lack of accountability, transparency. Undemocratic paternalism is inflicted through ideology, assuming the model IMF presents is universally applicable. Moreover, lack of accountability and transparency is pronounced in unfair trade agenda, the Uruguay round. The North, EU and US achieved bilateral conventions called Blair House Agreement to circumscribe the regulations imposed on subsidization of agriculture, leading to the failure of Uruguay round and exposing developing countries to greater risk and volatility. Stiglitz dismisses the current global governance without global government and champions global social justice, global affinity to exterminate poverty and create better environment.

== Globalization and its Discontents Revisited ==

In 2017, Stiglitz published a new edition of the book which explored more recent political developments in the developed world pertaining to the effects of neoliberal globalization. He argues that populist anti-globalization movements such as that of the Trump presidency, while accurately identifying certain negative effects of free trade agreements (e.g. NAFTA, which lowered prices for American consumers at the cost of local manufacturing jobs) other aspects of their critiques are flawed as are their prescriptions.

Stiglitz notes how Trump framed the United States as the victim of globalization, when it fact, many of the specific agreements his campaign took issues with were instigated at the behest of the US, primarily to its benefit, or at least, the benefit of the American business community, who, in the case of NAFTA, offshored large swathes of the US manufacturing base to the developing world, taking advantage of weaker regulatory and taxation regimes and cheap, non-unionized labour. Stiglitz is sympathetic to the grievances of the working classes in the developed world with respect to globalization, but sees right-wing populism as unlikely to provide substantial solutions. He argues that Trump’s proposed rewriting of NAFTA and imposition of 65% tariffs on Chinese goods, in addition to being in practice very difficult to enact, would have worsened the plight of the very groups they were intended to benefit.

== Reception ==
=== Praise ===
&quot;Globalisation and Its Discontents&quot; has earned praises from many reviewers. Noted investor George Soros describes the book as &quot;Penetrating, insightful... A seminal work that must be read.&quot;

Will Hutton from the British Guardian wrote: &quot;Stiglitz finishes his book with seven action points for change. He is not a global pessimist, but a realist - and instead of placing him in a neat box labelled &#x27;important contribution to the debate,&#x27; we should listen to him urgently.&quot;

The influential New York Review of Books stated that &quot;Joseph Stiglitz [...] has made incisive and highly valued contributions to the explanation of an astonishingly broad range of economic phenomena, including taxes, interest rates, consumer behavior, corporate finance, and much else. Especially among economists who are still of active working age, he ranks as a titan of the field,&quot; concluding that &quot;Stiglitz’s book will surely claim a large place on the public stage. It certainly stands as the most forceful argument that has yet been made against the IMF and its policies.&quot;

Business Week&#x27;s Michael J. Mandel opined that &quot;Stiglitz had a ringside seat for most of the major economic events of the last decade, including the Asian economic crisis and the transition of the former Soviet economies, as well as the administration of development programs throughout the world… This book recounts Stiglitz’s experiences, opening a window on previously unseen aspects of global economic policy. It is designed to provoke a healthy debate and… shows us in poignant terms why developing nations feel the economic deck is stacked against them.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
The book has also received criticisms from various opponents of his intellectual work affiliated with libertarian and (neo)conservative schools of thought. For instance, D. W. MacKenzie claims in the libertarian journal Public Choice that Stiglitz mischaracterizes government failures as market failures. Most of Stiglitz&#x27;s examples refer to government intervention that benefited special interests. Such examples are collective action failures of government through rent seeking.

Kenneth Rogoff, IMF Director of research, called Stiglitz&#x27;s analysis &quot;at best highly controversial, at worst, snake oil&quot; and stated that &quot;The Stiglitzian prescription (for third world nations in a debt crisis) is to raise the profile of fiscal deficits, that is, to issue more debt and to print more money. You seem to believe that if a distressed government issues more currency, its citizens will suddenly think it more valuable. You seem to believe that when investors are no longer willing to hold a government&#x27;s debt, all that needs to be done is to increase the supply and it will sell like hot cakes.&quot;

Daniel T. Griswold of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute labels the book a &quot;score-settling exercise distorted by the author&#x27;s own political prejudices and personal animus.&quot; Griswold takes issue with what he claims is Stiglitz&#x27;s assumption &quot;that protectionism enriches those nations that practice it&quot; and notes that &quot;while he is not questioning free trade, Stiglitz is disparaging the free flow of capital. The book blames the East Asian Financial Crisis almost entirely on one factor: capital account liberalisation.&quot; Stiglitz demonstrates this belief by &quot;prais[ing] Malaysia for spurning IMF advice ... by imposing capital controls to stem the flight of short term flows.&quot; Griswold also states that Stiglitz provided no evidence to support his belief that Malaysia was rewarded for their efforts. He counters that Malaysia&#x27;s GDP growth rate had fallen much farther than the other countries listed by Stiglitz, down to 6.7% and &quot;recovered less rapidly in 1999 and 2000 even though [others] did not resort to capital controls Stiglitz champions.&quot; Griswold concludes by arguing that Stiglitz &quot;distorts the history of the East Asian Miracle&quot;, while with Russian privatisation he &quot;ignores the fact that Russia&#x27;s initial reforms were timid and half baked&quot; and that the IMF with its beliefs in bail outs and non-market exchange rates is not the &quot;great symbol of market fundamentalism&quot;.

<text>The Land Conservancy of British Columbia (TLC) is a not-for-profit, charitable land trust based in British Columbia, Canada.

The purpose of the Society is to protect plants, animals, natural communities and landscape features that represent diversity of life on earth, by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive, and to protect areas of scientific, historical, cultural, scenic or compatible recreation value. This is accomplished by acquiring protective control of these lands and waters through ownership of the land or conservation covenants. As of 2024, TLC protects 9 properties and 250 conservation covenants across BC, comprising more than 15,000 acres.

The Land Conservancy achieves its conservation objectives by working in a non-confrontational, businesslike manner. TLC works with many partners, all levels of government, other agencies, businesses, community groups and individuals to ensure the broadest support for its activities. The goal of TLC is to protect and restore the biological diversity of British Columbia for present and future generations through action and education

The Land Conservancy draws much of its finances from membership revenue. It is operated by both paid staff and a large network of volunteers. It has an office in Victoria.

==History==

TLC was formed in 1997 with the help of Briony Penn. TLC has strong influences from The National Trust of England, Ireland and Wales, with whom it partakes in staff exchanges.

South Winchelsea Island, a island near Nanaimo, was The Land Conservancy&#x27;s first acquisition. It is important habitat for Steller sea lions and several migratory bird species. The property has since been transferred to The Nature Trust of British Columbia for continued stewardship.

Music star Nelly Furtado has been a strong supporter of the work of the TLC. The Land Conservancy first contacted Furtado when they discovered her interest in the Sooke Potholes, a place she used to enjoy as a child. The singer has been involved in the campaign to protect and promote the area ever since. In 2015, TLC transferred the three parcels it continued to own at the Sooke Potholes to the Capital Regional District (CRD) to become public parkland.

===Mascot===
The harlequin duck is the symbol of the Land Conservancy of British Columbia. The harlequin ranges throughout BC, from rocky coastal shores and islets to turbulent inland mountain creeks and calm lakes. A vulnerable species, the harlequin population is endangered due to habitat loss and degradation. The plucky harlequin is said to be an inspiration for the TLC to persevere in overcoming their obstacles.

===Creditor protection===
On October 7, 2013, TLC filed for protection under the &quot;Companies Creditors Arrangement Act&quot; (CCAA) to definitively resolve the organization’s long-standing financial problems. Under CCAA, TLC is working with land consultants to assess all properties and develop a plan consistent with TLC’s conservancy mandate and its objective to repay creditors to the greatest extent possible.

The CCAA process is conducted under the review of an independent, court appointed monitor and under the supervision of a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

On April 2, 2015, The Supreme Court of B.C. approved the Plan of Arrangement and Compromise as agreed upon by The Land Conservancy of B.C. (TLC) and its creditors. The Court-approved Plan of Arrangement will see secured creditors paid in full, have their secured debt assumed by a third party, or receive the mortgaged property in settlement of their secured debt, within six months. Unsecured creditors will receive payouts of the fullest extent possible in multiple tranches.

TLC’s Plan contains a multi-faceted approach to eliminating the debt. It includes innovative approaches such as density transfers, specified donations, heritage revitalization agreements, mortgage transfers, and partnership agreements with other Land Trusts and Societies. The transfers will see the original donor’s intentions upheld and TLC&#x27;s sites protected.

In an effort to stave off bankruptcy, the Conservancy entered into a sale agreement for property containing the architecturally and historically significant B.C. Binning house in Victoria. In January 2014, a B.C. court blocked the sale. The house has been returned to the original estate and is no longer owned by TLC.

The Conservancy was also looking for a buyer for its Keating Farm Property in 2014. On March 4, 2014, the Supreme Court of B.C. approved the sale of Keating Farm to Georgios and Rebecca Papadopoulos, who have plans to restore the old farm house and work with tenant farmers to continue farming the land currently in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR).

On December 2, 2016, TLC held its final meeting with creditors to seek approval of its revised Plan of Arrangement and Compromise (POA) and the conclusion of its time under the &quot;Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act&quot; (CCAA). In a supportive vote, creditors approved the non-profit’s POA and subsequent exiting of creditor protection.

==Projects and properties==

The Land Conservancy accomplishes its work through the use of covenants, land purchases, long-term leases and agreements with local and provincial governments. The land assets of the TLC are valued at over $30 million.

TLC-owned properties include:
TLC&#x27;s Conservation Covenants include:

<doc id="693453" wikidata="Q3001796" url="?curid=693453" title="Skolem–Noether theorem">
<text>In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the Skolem–Noether theorem characterizes the automorphisms of simple rings. It is a fundamental result in the theory of central simple algebras.

The theorem was first published by Thoralf Skolem in 1927 in his paper &quot;Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme&quot; (German: &quot;On the theory of associative number systems&quot;) and later rediscovered by Emmy Noether.

== Statement ==
In a general formulation, let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be simple unitary rings, and let &quot;k&quot; be the center of &quot;B&quot;. The center &quot;k&quot; is a field since given &quot;x&quot; nonzero in &quot;k&quot;, the simplicity of &quot;B&quot; implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal is the whole of &quot;B&quot;, and hence that &quot;x&quot; is a unit. If the dimension of &quot;B&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is finite, i.e. if &quot;B&quot; is a central simple algebra of finite dimension, and &quot;A&quot; is also a &quot;k&quot;-algebra, then given &quot;k&quot;-algebra homomorphisms

:&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;,

there exists a unit &quot;b&quot; in &quot;B&quot; such that for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;

:&quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;b&quot; · &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) · &quot;b&quot;−1.

In particular, every automorphism of a central simple &quot;k&quot;-algebra is an inner automorphism.

== Proof ==
First suppose formula_1. Then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; define the actions of &quot;A&quot; on formula_2; let formula_3 denote the &quot;A&quot;-modules thus obtained. Since formula_4 the map &quot;f&quot; is injective by simplicity of &quot;A&quot;, so &quot;A&quot; is also finite-dimensional. Hence two simple &quot;A&quot;-modules are isomorphic and formula_3 are finite direct sums of simple &quot;A&quot;-modules. Since they have the same dimension, it follows that there is an isomorphism of &quot;A&quot;-modules formula_6. But such &quot;b&quot; must be an element of formula_7. For the general case, formula_8 is a matrix algebra and that formula_9 is simple. By the first part applied to the maps formula_10, there exists formula_11 such that
:formula_12
for all formula_13 and formula_14. Taking formula_15, we find
:formula_16
for all &quot;z&quot;. That is to say, &quot;b&quot; is in formula_17 and so we can write formula_18. Taking formula_19 this time we find
:formula_20,
which is what was sought.

<doc id="693454" wikidata="Q1141245" url="?curid=693454" title="Insomniac Games">
<text>Insomniac Games, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Burbank, California, and part of PlayStation Studios. It was founded in 1994 by Ted Price as Xtreme Software, and was renamed Insomniac Games a year later. The company is most known for developing several early PlayStation mascots, Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet and Clank, as well as the &quot;Resistance&quot; franchise, 2014&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot; and the &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot; series with Marvel Games. In 2019, the studio was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment, becoming a part of SIE Worldwide Studios (now known as PlayStation Studios).

The company&#x27;s first project was &quot;Disruptor&quot;, for PlayStation, whose poor sales almost led to the company&#x27;s bankruptcy. Insomniac&#x27;s next project was &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, a successful video game that spawned two sequels within two years. Insomniac closely collaborated with Sony Computer Entertainment (later renamed Sony Interactive Entertainment) and created two game franchises, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, and &quot;Resistance&quot;. The two franchises proved to be both a critical and financial success for the company. The company began work on its first multiplatform game &quot;Fuse&quot; in 2013 (with Electronic Arts as its publisher), but the game turned out to become one of Insomniac&#x27;s worst-reviewed games.

Since 2014, Insomniac has actively expanded its portfolio of games. The company worked with Microsoft Studios on 2014&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot;, partnered with GameTrust to release the underwater Metroidvania game &quot;Song of the Deep&quot;, and released several mobile games and virtual reality projects. In 2016, Insomniac released a re-imagining of the first &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, and in 2018 released its first licensed title, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot; for the PlayStation 4; an additional game, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&quot;, was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 in 2020. The studio&#x27;s most recent project is &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&quot; (2023); it is currently developing &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine&quot; for the PlayStation 5.

Before 2019, Insomniac remained as an independent studio working for Sony and other publishers such as Microsoft, EA, and Oculus. In August 2019, Sony announced it had agreed to acquire Insomniac as the 14th internal studio within SIE Worldwide Studios. Over the years, Insomniac Games has received considerable recognition from critics as an acclaimed video game developer. It was named the twentieth-best video game developer by &quot;IGN&quot;, and one of the best places to work in America by the Society for Human Resource Management.

==History==

=== Founding and &quot;Disruptor&quot; (1994–1996) ===

Insomniac Games was founded by Ted Price, who was determined to work in the video game industry since the release of Atari 2600 in 1977, when he was nine years old. The company was incorporated on February 28, 1994.

Price was joined by Alex Hastings, his fellow graduate and an expert in computer programming, in June 1994. Hastings&#x27; brother Brian Hastings joined Insomniac shortly afterwards. The studio was named &quot;Xtreme Software&quot; for a year but in 1995 it was forced to rename itself by another company with the same name. The studio shortlisted &quot;The Resistance Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, &quot;Black Sun Software&quot;, &quot;Ice Nine&quot; and &quot;Moon Turtle&quot; before choosing the name &quot;Insomniac Games&quot;. According to Price, the company chose this name because &quot;it suddenly makes sense&quot;, even though it was not their first choice.

Shortly after the company&#x27;s establishment, it began developing its first project. The team took inspirations from the popular &quot;Doom&quot;, and hoped to capitalize upon the industry&#x27;s excitement for a first-person shooter. The team lacked experience and considered developing a &quot;&quot;Doom&quot; clone&quot;. The game was developed for the Panasonic 3DO because its developer kit was inexpensive, and the team had high hopes for the console. Using a time frame of one month, the team developed a functional gameplay demo for the game. It was pitched to various publishers and was later shown to Mark Cerny, an executive producer from Universal Interactive Studios, who was impressed by the team&#x27;s efforts. Universal published the game and helped with funding and marketing. Universal helped the game&#x27;s development and cutscenes, and hired actors to film real-time sequences. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to lead production design, and inspirations were taken from &quot;Warhawk&quot;.

Cerny gave input and feedback on the game&#x27;s level-design. However, the 3DO did not perform as they had expected, and Universal suggested that the team should switch to Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s PlayStation to increase sales of the game. The game originally ran on a custom engine developed by Alex Hastings, and was upgraded and converted for the PlayStation within a month. The debut title was called &quot;Disruptor&quot;, and was released worldwide in November 1996.

&quot;Disruptor&quot; was released to positive critical reception, and was named &quot;Dark Horse of the Year&quot; by various gaming publications. John Romero, founder of &quot;Doom&quot; developer id Software praised the game. Insomniac considered &quot;Disruptor&quot; a lesson about video game development. According to Price, it was &quot;the best game that nobody ever heard of&quot;. With little marketing and advertisement, the game was a commercial failure for Insomniac. Despite the game&#x27;s poor performance, Universal continued to partner with Insomniac for its next game. The team&#x27;s morale was low; they decided to develop something new instead of a sequel to &quot;Disruptor&quot;.

=== &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; (1996–2000) ===
At that time, the demographic for the PlayStation shifted, as more children and teenagers started to use the console. As a result, the team decided not to make another violent game like &quot;Disruptor&quot; and instead develop a family-friendly game that would be suitable for every member of a family, regardless of their age. The family game market was dominated by Sony&#x27;s competitor Nintendo with games like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, while the PlayStation had no similar exclusives. Cerny pushed Insomniac Games to develop a game with a mascot and mass appeal. Craig Stitt, an environment artist of &quot;Disruptor&quot;, proposed that the game&#x27;s theme and story should revolve around an anthropomorphic dragon. At the same time, Alex Hastings began developing an engine that specialized in games with panoramic view, which is suitable for open world games. The engine allowed more gameplay features including the ability for the dragon to glide through air. &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; was released in late 1998.

The game received critical acclaim upon launch and received awards from publications. Sales of the game were relatively low initially, but climbed after Christmas that year, and overall sales of the game exceeded two million. The team was expanded to 13 staff members. Because of &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;″s success, the studio was requested to develop a sequel for it. The development of &quot;Spyro 2: Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot; began shortly after the launch of &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;. The team considered developing the sequel a challenge for them; they had to develop new ideas to &quot;revolutionize&quot; the franchise within a short time. The team brainstormed ideas but later chose to expand a mini-game from the original &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, which they thought had offered a different experience from &quot;Spyro&quot;. The team designed a mature story and advanced cinematics for the game. It met its target release window, and was released in late 1999. Hastings was worried about the release because the game&#x27;s development cycle was rushed and truncated.

The studio was asked to develop the third installment in the &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; series upon the release of &quot;Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot;. To make the game more varied than its predecessors, the team introduced more special moves for Spyro the Dragon and more playable characters. The dragon&#x27;s personality was made more approachable for players. The company struggled to create new ideas for the sequel. During the game&#x27;s development, the team expanded to about 20 to 25 people. Brian Allgeier, who would later become Insomniac&#x27;s games&#x27; director, joined the studio at that time. &quot;&quot; was released worldwide in late 2000. After releasing three games in three years, the team decided to move on for a new project that had new original characters. &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; is the last Insomniac Games-developed &quot;Spyro&quot; game. Universal retains the intellectual property rights to the &quot;Spyro&quot; series. This was the end of Insomniac Games&#x27; partnership with Universal as the team at Insomniac started to work directly to develop games for the PlayStation consoles.

=== &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; (2000–2005) ===
In 2000, Sony released its successor to the PlayStation, the PlayStation 2. Insomniac&#x27;s ideas for its first PlayStation 2 project included &quot;Monster Knight&quot;, a concept that was designed in 1999 but the game did not get beyond its planning stage. The canceled project was revealed 13 years after the game&#x27;s conception. The second title was &quot;Girl with a Stick&quot;, which took inspirations from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. It was intended as a serious game, and to prove Insomniac&#x27;s ability to create games other than platformers. Insomniac spent six months on the project, developing several prototypes and a functional demo. However, most staff members, beside Price, were not passionate about the project, and thought it was &quot;one-dimensional&quot;. Sony thought the game would not find a market, and recommended Insomniac to &quot;play to [their] strengths&quot;. As a result, &quot;Girl with a Stick&quot; was scrapped. According to Price, &quot;Girl with a Stick&quot; is a lesson for Insomniac and its first failure.

A few weeks after the cancellation of &quot;Girl with a Stick&quot;, Brian Hastings proposed that the company should work on a space adventure game with a science fiction theme. The game originally revolved around a reptilian alien with weapons traveling across planets. The reptile character evolved into a caveman, and eventually became a fictional creature called a &quot;Lombax&quot;. They named the creature Ratchet and designed a robot companion called Clank for Ratchet. Inspirations for the game were drawn from manga, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; and from &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;. To differentiate the project from Insomniac&#x27;s previous projects, they made the game more complex and included shooting and role-playing gameplay elements. The team was excited about this project; however, the company was unable to develop a demo for the game because it did not have a suitable engine. As a result, they developed &quot;Art Nuevo de Flash Gordon&quot;, a Metropolis diorama, for Sony, which decided to help the game&#x27;s funding and publishing. Jason Rubin, on behalf of Naughty Dog, lent Insomniac the engine used in &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;. The game&#x27;s title was &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;; it was originally to be a launch title for the PlayStation 2 but it was delayed by two years and was released in November 2002. It was a critical success.

Five months before the launch of &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, Sony approved the development of its sequel. Insomniac hoped to bring new elements to the franchise; it received feedback from players and improved some features of &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;. About a year later, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando&quot; was released to critical acclaim, at which time Insomniac had finished the prototype of their next game, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal&quot;, which introduced a multiplayer mode and expanded upon &quot;Going Commando&quot;″s arenas. Alex Hastings continued to optimize the engine and increase its processing power to fine-tune the game. The sales of &quot;Up Your Arsenal&quot; were considerably higher than those of its predecessors; it was the highest-rated game in the franchise&#x27;s history.

Insomniac released three &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; games within three years. As of 2005, Insomniac intended to change the direction of the franchise after &quot;Up Your Arsenal&quot;. Hastings hoped the company&#x27;s next game would have a darker tone than its predecessors. As a result, the plot switched its focus to Ratchet. The developers were inspired by &quot;The Running Man&quot; and &quot;Battle Royale&quot;; they developed an action game with no platform elements. While the gameplay of the fourth game in the series is similar to that of its predecessors, Clank&#x27;s role was significantly diminished and the character&#x27;s name was removed from the game&#x27;s title. &quot;&quot; was released in 2005.

=== PlayStation 3 era (2006–2012) ===
While Insomniac was handling the development of the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; franchise, the team wanted to work on something else. With the launch of the PlayStation 3, the team thought users of the new console would be more mature than those of its predecessors and wanted to develop a game to cater for them. They thought the studio should not specialize in one genre. This new project was part of Insomniac&#x27;s expansion; the company wanted to have multiple projects in parallel development. This project began development after the completion of &quot;Deadlocked&quot;. The team agreed to develop something different for a different platform. Inspired by &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;&quot; was Insomniac&#x27;s first first-person shooter after &quot;Disruptor&quot;. To make the game stand-out, they experimented with turning it into a squad-based shooter and introducing giant lizard enemies which were later scrapped. Sony recommended Insomniac to change its lizard antagonist because they were not fun to play with. Furthermore, the team disagreed about the game&#x27;s setting.

Cerny wanted to set the game—proposed as a &quot;space opera&quot; game—during World War I, but this was later changed to World War II because the developers wanted to introduce extreme weaponry to the game. It was shifted to the 1950s because the team considered the market for World War II shooters was over-saturated at that time. &quot;Resistance: Fall of Man&quot; was a launch title for the PlayStation 3; the team said developing a new game for the console was a challenge because they had to work quickly to meet its target release window. The game was a financial and critical success, despite causing controversy over the use of Manchester Cathedral. The development of the sequel soon began; the team wanted to drastically change the game, leading to internal debate between staff members. The sequel, &quot;Resistance 2&quot;, was released in 2008.

Meanwhile, development of the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; franchise continued. The team decided to rewrite the characters when the franchise shifted to the PlayStation 3. They introduced the &quot;Future&quot; series, which includes &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot; (2007), &quot;Quest for Booty&quot; (2008) and &quot;A Crack in Time&quot; (2009). In 2008, the company established a new studio of 25 to 30 developers, led by Chad Dezern and Shaun McCabe, in North Carolina. The new studio was responsible for some of Insomniac&#x27;s &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; games.

Both the &quot;Resistance&quot; franchise and the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; franchise continued into the 2010s. The team in North Carolina developed &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One&quot;, which received mixed reviews. The North Carolina team continued to develop the next game in the series, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Full Frontal Assault&quot;, which expanded upon levels from previous games in the series and has a structure similar to that of a tower defense game.

Meanwhile, the company developed &quot;Resistance 3&quot;—the sequel to &quot;Resistance 2&quot;—which was designed to be similar to &quot;Fall of Man&quot;. The team at Insomniac reviewed players&#x27; feedback regarding the negative aspects of &quot;Resistance 2&quot;, re-introduced some mechanics from &quot;Fall of Man&quot;, and focused on narrative. They considered such an approach can differentiate a franchise from other first-person shooters. &quot;Resistance 3&quot; was regarded by the team as the best game in the series, but it sold poorly and was a financial failure. According to Price, the team was disappointed but were still proud of the project. In early 2012, Price announced that the company would not be involved in any future &quot;Resistance&quot; projects. Sony retains the intellectual property rights to the franchise.

=== Diversifying portfolio (2012–2019) ===
Insomniac had exclusively developed games for the PlayStation console until in 2010 when Insomniac announced its partnership with Electronic Arts via EA Partners to develop a multi-platform game for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 console. The company hoped to reach a wider audience, while keeping the rights to its IP and retain full control of its franchises. The company revealed nothing about the game. The company established a new subsidiary called Insomniac Click, which focused on casual games and games for Facebook. Its first game was not set in any of Insomniac&#x27;s existing franchises. Insomniac again partnered with Electronic Arts, which owned the casual game developer Playfish, to help the game to reach a broad audience. &quot;Outernauts&quot; was announced shortly after; it was released in July 2012 for browsers and mobile platforms. Click was later re-incorporated into Insomniac, and the browser version of &quot;Outernauts&quot; was canceled.

The EA Partners game was revealed at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 as &quot;Overstrike&quot;. This game was pitched by &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; director Brian Allgeier and it has a direction similar to that of the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; series. The team thought &quot;Overstrike&quot; would appeal to teenagers. After several play-testing sessions, they realized their game was too simple for their target group. The company developed many weapons for the game, none of which related to the game&#x27;s story. The developers retooled the game and changed it to attract older players and make weapons an important part of the game. The game focuses on a co-operative campaign, which the company thought was a popular trend at that time. It was renamed &quot;Fuse&quot; and was released worldwide in May 2013. &quot;Fuse&quot; was one of the lowest-rated games developed by Insomniac, and was another commercial failure, debuting in 37th place in the UK in its first week of release. &quot;Fuse&quot; was considered a learning lesson for Insomniac to understand the type of game they are good at making. The reception to &quot;Fuse&quot; showed the company it should develop &quot;colorful, playful experiences that&#x27;s loaded with unusual, sometimes silly weapons&quot;. Also in 2013, the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future&quot; game, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Into the Nexus&quot;, was released.

Running parallel development with &quot;Fuse&quot;, and beginning soon after the completion of &quot;Resistance 3&quot;, Insomniac Games began development on &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot;. The game was inspired by &quot;Hyena Men of Kenya&quot;, &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot; was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac&#x27;s head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game&#x27;s development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the intellectual property. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot; was made for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.

Insomniac announced &quot;Slow Down, Bull&quot;, a part-commercial and part-charity project for release on Microsoft Windows; it is the company&#x27;s first game for Windows. Insomniac released a remake of &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; for the PlayStation 4 in 2016. In January 2016, Insomniac announced their next game, &quot;Song of the Deep&quot;, a water-based video game inspired by &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The game was published by retailer GameStop.

During E3 2015, the company announced &quot;Edge of Nowhere&quot;, a third-person action-adventure game for the virtual reality hardware Oculus Rift. In April 2016, the company announced two new virtual reality titles: &quot;Feral Rites&quot;, a hack and slash game, and &quot;The Unspoken&quot;, a fantasy multiplayer game, for the Oculus Rift. According to Price, the company began focusing on virtual reality projects as the team is enthusiastic about the technology, and that it allows the company to develop an expertise in creating VR games. The studio signed an exclusive deal with Oculus VR as Insomniac believed that both companies shared the same passion to &quot;[bring] games to life&quot;, and that they allowed Insomniac to retain the rights of their intellectual properties. Price compared the agreement to their previous first-party deals, and added that having the opportunity to develop games for the first generation of VR platforms is something the team could not reject. Despite the new direction, Price added that they will not give up on making console AAA video games. At E3 2016, Insomniac announced their next AAA title, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot;, developed for the PlayStation 4 in conjunction with Marvel Entertainment. Bryan Intihar, producer of &quot;Sunset Overdrive&quot;, was the game&#x27;s creative director.
In September 2017, Insomniac Games revealed its new brand logo, which replaced the moon image standing in for the &quot;O&quot; with a more stylized iconograph. The company said that part of their rebranding was to &quot;think beyond the moon&quot;. Insomniac chief brand officer Ryan Schneider said part of the rebranding was to prevent the studio being pigeonholed; while the moon-based logo had well-represented the company for its &quot;Spyro&quot; and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; cartoon-like games, it did not reflect well on the expanded directions they had moved in recent years, such as the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; game. Schneider said that along with the brand change, the company plans to be engaging with players, offering live-streaming of their work, and re-establishing a new identity, without completely eschewing their past. Schneider said they effectively &quot;blew up the moon&quot; to establish this new direction.

=== Sony acquisition (2019–present) ===
In August 2019, Sony announced a definitive agreement to acquire Insomniac as one of its first-party developers. This would make Insomniac the 14th internal studio with Sony&#x27;s SIE Worldwide Studios division. Sony&#x27;s Shawn Layden stated they had been evaluating the option of acquiring Insomniac for some time, and the success of their &quot;Spider-Man&quot; game contributed significantly towards this end, demonstrating that Insomniac was an &quot;impact maker&quot; and a &quot;style-setter&quot;. Layden believed that Insomniac&#x27;s working relationship with Sony would not change significantly in the acquisition, leaving the studio in its own creative control, but would allow Insomniac to have closer access to other innovative technologies throughout SIE Worldwide Studios. The acquisition, for which Sony paid (equivalent to ), was completed on November 15, 2019.

At the PlayStation 5 reveal event on June 11, 2020, Insomniac announced two new games: &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales&quot;, a spin-off to &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot;, and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&quot;. The former was a launch title for the PS5, released alongside a remaster of the original &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot; for the console in November 2020. The latter released on June 11, 2021, exclusively for the PS5.

On September 9, 2021, at the PlayStation showcase event, Insomniac announced a sequel to &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider Man&quot; entitled &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2&quot; would be released in 2023 for PlayStation 5. The company also announced the development of a standalone game, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine&quot;, likewise for the PS5. 

In December 2023, hackers from ransomware group Rhysida targeted Insomniac, threatening to release information if they did not pay 2 million dollars in bitcoin. Insomniac refused to pay, and as a result, over 1.67 terabytes of data was leaked containing files, including an early release build of &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Wolverine&quot;. The leak also contained Insomniac and Sony Interactive Entertainment data such as employees&#x27; personal information, past sales information, and plans for Insomniac through 2032. These included additional titles from Marvel, including a Venom-based game, as well as possible X-Men titles that would remain exclusive to the PlayStation platform through 2035. Players, developers, and publishers expressed sympathy for the leak, and Insomniac stated on social media that &quot;We’re both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyberattack on our studio and the emotional toll it’s taken on our dev team. We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other.&quot; The studio intends to continue work on &quot;Wolverine&quot;, stressing that the leaked version was still from early in development. According to Rhysida, only 98% of the data they acquired was leaked, with the other 2% being sold, and their only motivation for the attack was for money.

In July 2024, voice actors, motion capture employees and some other people employed by Insomniac who were member of Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) members would begin a labor strike over concerns about A.I.

Price announced his retirement as CEO in January 2025, to leave by the end of March 2025. His position will be filled jointly by Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern as co-studio heads.

== Games developed ==
===&quot;Spyro&quot; (1998–2000)===

<doc id="693465" wikidata="Q1322445" url="?curid=693465" title="Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr">
<text>Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr (; 1 March 1935 – 9 April 1980), also known as al-Shahid al-Khamis (), was an Iraqi Islamic scholar, philosopher, and the ideological founder of the Islamic Dawa Party, born in al-Kadhimiya, Iraq. He was father-in-law to Muqtada al-Sadr, a cousin of Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr and Imam Musa as-Sadr. His father Haydar al-Sadr was a well-respected high-ranking Shi&#x27;a cleric. His lineage can be traced back to Muhammad through the seventh Shia Imam Musa al-Kazim. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr was executed in 1980 by the regime of Saddam Hussein along with his sister, Amina Sadr bint al-Huda.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr was born in al-Kazimiya, Iraq to the prominent Sadr family, which originated from Jabal Amel in Lebanon. His father died in 1937, leaving the family destitute. In 1945, the family moved to the holy city of Najaf, where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. He was a child prodigy who, at 10, was delivering lectures on Islamic history. At eleven, he was a student of logic. He wrote a book criticizing materialist philosophy when he was 24. Al-Sadr completed his religious studies at religious seminaries under al-Khoei and Muhsin al-Hakim, and began teaching at the age of 25.

===Struggle against Saddam Hussein===
Al-Sadr&#x27;s works attracted the ire of the Baath Party, leading to repeated imprisonment where he was often tortured. Despite this, he continued his work after being released. When the Ba&#x27;athists arrested Al-Sadr in 1977, his sister Amina Sadr bint al-Huda made a speech in the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf inviting the people to demonstrate. Many demonstrations were held, forcing the Ba&#x27;athists to release Al-Sadr who was placed under house arrest.

In 1979–1980, anti-Ba&#x27;ath riots arose in Iraq&#x27;s Shia areas by groups who were working toward an Islamic revolution in their country. Hussein and his deputies believed that the riots had been inspired by the Iranian Revolution and instigated by Iran&#x27;s government. In the aftermath of Iran&#x27;s revolution, Iraq&#x27;s Shia community called on Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr to be their &quot;Iraqi Ayatollah Khomeini&quot;, leading a revolt against the Ba&#x27;ath regime. Community leaders, tribal heads, and hundreds of ordinary members of the public paid their allegiance to al-Sadr. Protests then erupted in Baghdad and the predominantly Shia provinces of the south in May 1979. For nine days, protests against the regime unfolded, but were suppressed by the regime. The cleric&#x27;s imprisonment led to another wave of protests in June after a seminal, powerful appeal from al-Sadr&#x27;s sister, Bint al-Huda. Further clashes unfolded between the security forces and protestors. Najaf was put under siege and thousands were tortured and executed. Al-Sadr issued a fatwa prohibiting membership in the ruling Ba&#x27;ath party. Called upon by the government to retract it he refused.

===Execution===
Baqir al-Sadr was arrested on April 5, 1980, with his sister, Sayyidah bint al-Huda. They had formed a powerful militant movement in opposition to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

On April 9, 1980, Al-Sadr and his sister were killed after being severely tortured by their captors. Signs of torture could be seen on the bodies.

An iron nail was hammered into Al-Sadr&#x27;s head and he was then set on fire in Najaf. It has been reported that Saddam Hussein himself killed them. The Baathists delivered the bodies of Baqir al-Sadr and Bint al-Huda to their cousin Sayyid Mohammad al-Sadr.

They were buried in the Wadi-us-Salaam graveyard in the holy city of Najaf the same night. His execution raised no criticism from Western countries because Al-Sadr had openly supported Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. In 2024, Saadoun Sabri Jamil Jumaa al-Qaisi, a senior security official during Saddam&#x27;s regime, was arrested in Erbil for overseeing Al-Sadr&#x27;s detention and killing.

==Scholarship and ideas==
The works by Baqir al-Sadr contains traditional Shia thoughts, while they also suggest ways Shia could &quot;accommodate modernity&quot;. 

The two major works by him are &quot;Iqtisaduna&quot; on Islamic economics, and &quot;Falsafatuna&quot; (Our Philosophy). They were detailed critiques of Marxism that presented his early ideas on an alternative Islamic form of government. They were critiques of both socialism and capitalism. He was subsequently commissioned by the government of Kuwait to assess how that country&#x27;s oil wealth could be managed in keeping with Islamic principles. This led to a major work on Islamic banking, which still forms the basis for modern Islamic banks.

Using his knowledge of the Quran and a subject-based approach to Quranic exegesis, Al-Sadr extracted two concepts from the Holy text in relation to governance: 
*&quot;khilafat al-insan&quot; (Man as heir or trustee of God) and
* &quot;shahadat al-anbiya&quot; (Prophets as witnesses). 
Al-Sadr explained that throughout history there have been &quot;...two lines. Man&#x27;s line and the Prophet&#x27;s line. The line of Man is the &quot;khalifa&quot; (trustee) who inherits the earth from God; the line of the Prophet is the &quot;shahid&quot; (witness)&quot;.

Al-Sadr demonstrated that &quot;khilafa&quot; (governance) is &quot;a right given to the whole of humanity&quot; and defined it as an obligation given from God to the human race to &quot;tend the globe and administer human affairs&quot;. This was a major advancement of Islamic political theory.

While Al-Sadr identified &quot;khilafa&quot; as the obligation and right of the people, he used a broad-based explanation of Quranic verse 5:44 to identify who held the responsibility of &quot;shahada&quot; in an Islamic state. First were the Prophets (anbiya&#x27;). Second were the Imams who are considered a divine (&quot;rabbani&quot;) continuation of the Prophets in this line. The last were the &quot;marja&#x27;iyya&quot; (&quot;see Marja&quot;).

While the two functions of &quot;khilafa&quot; and &quot;shahada&quot; (supervision and witness ) were united during the times of the Prophets, they diverged during the occultation so that &quot;khilafa&quot; returned to the people (&quot;umma&quot;) and &quot;shahada&quot; to the scholars.

Al-Sadr &#x27;s practical application of how 
&quot;khilafa&quot;, would be returned to the [Muslim] people in the absence of the twelfth Imam was with the establishment of a democratic system, whereby the people regularly elect their representatives in government:
Islamic theory rejects monarchy as well as the various forms of dictatorial government; it also rejects the aristocratic regimes and proposes a form of government, which contains all the positive aspects of the democratic system.
He continued to champion this point until his final days:

Lastly, I demand, in the name of all of you and in the name of the values you uphold, to allow the people the opportunity truly to exercise their right in running the affairs of the country by holding elections in which a council representing the ummah (people) could truly emerge.&#x27; &quot;

Al-Sadr was executed by Saddam Hussein in 1980 before he was able to provide any details of the mechanism for the practical application of the &quot;shahada&quot; concept in an Islamic state. A few elaborations of &quot;shahada&quot; can be found in Al-Sadr&#x27;s works. In his text &quot;Role of the Shiah Imams in the Reconstruction of Islamic Society&quot;, Al-Sadr illustrates the scope and limitations of &quot;shahada&quot; by using the example of the third Shi&#x27;i Imam, Hussein ibn Ali (the grandson of Muhammad), who defied Yazid, the ruler at the time. Al-Sadr explained that Yazid was not simply acting counter to Islamic teachings, as many rulers before and after him had done, but he was distorting the teachings and traditions of Islam and presenting his deviant ideas as representative of Islam itself. This, therefore, is what led Imam Hussein to intervene challenging Yazid in order to restore the true teachings of Islam, and consequently laying down his own life. In Al-Sadr&#x27;s own words, the &quot;shahid&#x27;s&quot; (witness – person performing &quot;shahada&quot; or supervision) duties are &quot;to protect the correct doctrines and to see that deviations do not grow to the extent of threatening the ideology itself&quot;.

=== The Logical Foundations of Induction ===
One notable book that is considered by scholars to be a great achievement of al-Sadr is his book entitled &quot;The Logical Foundations of Induction.&quot; This book represents the core of al-Sadr&#x27;s attempt to give a rational logical foundation for growing knowledge by inductive means, and ultimately establish a new inductive logic termed by al-Sadr as the &quot;Subjectivist Logic&quot; (), that sets the logical rules for this type of knowledge growth. 

==List of works==
Al-Sadr engaged Western philosophical ideas, challenging them as necessary and incorporating them where appropriate, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating that religious knowledge was not antithetical to scientific knowledge. The following is a list of his work:

===Jurisprudence===
*&quot;Buhuth fi Sharh al- &#x27;Urwah al&#x27; Wuthqa&quot; (Discourses on the Commentary of &quot;al- &#x27;Urwah al-Wuthqa&quot;), four volumes

*&quot;Al-Fatawa al-Wadhihah&quot; (Clear Decrees).
*&quot;Mujaz Ahkam al-Hajj&quot; (Summarized Rules of Hajj)

<doc id="693469" wikidata="Q966448" url="?curid=693469" title="George Frederick Bodley">
<text>George Frederick Bodley (14 March 182721 October 1907) was an English Gothic Revival architect. He was a pupil of Sir George Gilbert Scott and worked with C. E. Kempe. He was in partnership with Thomas Garner for much of his career and was one of the founders of Watts &amp; Co.

==Personal life==
Bodley was the youngest son of William Hulme Bodley, of Edinburgh, physician at Hull Royal Infirmary, Hull, who in 1838 retired to his wife&#x27;s home town, Brighton. George&#x27;s eldest brother, the Rev. W. H. Bodley, became a well-known Roman Catholic preacher and a professor at St Mary&#x27;s College, New Oscott, Birmingham.

He married Minna F. H. Reavely, daughter of Thomas George Wood Reavely, at Kinnersley Castle in 1872. They had a son, George H. Bodley, born in 1874.

==Career==

Bodley was articled to the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, a relative by marriage, under whose influence he became imbued with the spirit of the Gothic revival, and he became known as the chief exponent of 14th-century English Gothic, and the leading ecclesiastical architect in England. He is regarded as the leader of the resurgence of interest in English and Northern European late-medieval design. Noted for his pioneering design work in the Queen Anne revival.

Bodley became acquainted with William Morris in the late 1850s, and in the 1860s his commissions for stained glass and ecclesiastical decoration helped ensure the success of Morris&#x27;s firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., founded in 1861. Bodley is said to have designed two of Morris&#x27;s early wallpapers. By the late 1860s Bodley had become disenchanted with Morris, and for stained glass turned to the firm of Burlison and Grylls, founded in 1868, for the glass in his later churches, notably St Augustine&#x27;s Church, Pendlebury, near Manchester (designed 1870) and the Church of the Holy Angels, Hoar Cross in Staffordshire (designed 1871–72). 

Bodley worked with his lifelong friend, the stained glass designer Charles Eamer Kempe. They collaborated on projects including: St John the Baptist, Tuebrook in Liverpool; Queens&#x27; College Chapel, Cambridge; All Saints, Danehill, East Sussex and the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. His alterations to St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Gloucester Road, London, the architect and president of RIBA, Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel said tamed the work of its founding &#x27;rogue&#x27; Victorian architect, Joseph Peacock.

===Partnership with Thomas Garner===
From 1869 he worked in a twenty-eight-year partnership with Thomas Garner, designing collegiate buildings in Oxford and Cambridge, country houses and churches throughout the British Isles. One cathedral was completed to his design: St David&#x27;s Cathedral, Hobart in Tasmania, Australia (first design, 1865; revised 1891; building completed 1936). In 1906 Bodley designed with his pupil Henry Vaughan the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. He also designed Grace Cathedral, San Francisco in 1862, and again for its post-1906 earthquake replacement but it was adapted by his partner after his death.

As well as Vaughan, Bodley and Garner&#x27;s pupils included the garden designer Inigo Thomas who specialised in formal gardens with geometrical plans in 17th- and 18th-century styles, which suited the houses that Bodley and Garner renovated for wealthy clients.

In 1874 Bodley founded Watts &amp; Co. with Garner and George Gilbert Scott Jr. Bodley, Garner, and Scott all lived on Church Row in Hampstead in the 1860s and 70s.

His secular work included the London School Board offices, and in collaboration with Garner, the new buildings at Magdalen College, Oxford, and Hewell Grange, Worcestershire (for Lord Windsor).

===Liverpool Cathedral competition===
In 1902 Bodley was an assessor for the competition to design Liverpool Cathedral which selected a design by the young Giles Gilbert Scott. When construction of the cathedral began in 1904, Bodley was appointed to oversee Gilbert Scott&#x27;s work, but had no direct part in its design.

===Late works===
One of Bodley&#x27;s final architectural works was the chapel at Bedford School, the foundation stone of which was laid on 18 May 1907 by Lord St John of Bletso. Building took a year, the chapel was consecrated in July 1908, but by which time Bodley had died. The other was the St Chad&#x27;s parish church, Burton upon Trent. Work started in 1905 and the church was consecrated in 1910. After Bodley&#x27;s death his partner Cecil Greenwood Hare took over the project; his contribution was the design of an octagonal choir vestry.

===Royal Academy===
Bodley exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1854. He was elected an associate of the academy in 1881 and a full academician in 1902.

===Other activities===
As well as being an architect, he was a draughtsman, a connoisseur of art, published a volume of poems in 1899, inspired art works by painters such as John Melhuish Strudwick and designed wallpaper and chintzes for Watts &amp; Co. He served as prime warden of the Fishmongers&#x27; Company in 1901–02. In early life he had been in close alliance with the Pre-Raphaelites, and he did a great deal to improve public taste in domestic decoration and furniture.

==Death==
Bodley died on 21 October 1907 at Water Eaton, Oxfordshire and is buried in the churchyard of the Church of St James, Kinnersley, Herefordshire.

<text>Yoseph Alicia Machado Fajardo (; born December 6, 1976) is a Venezuelan-American actress, TV host, singer and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 1996, she previously crowned Miss Venezuela 1995. She was the fourth woman from Venezuela to be named Miss Universe.

==Early life==
Machado was born in Maracay, Venezuela. Her father was a toy store owner who emigrated from Spain and her mother&#x27;s family emigrated from Cuba prior to the Cuban revolution. Machado took to performing at an early age. She began dancing at age 4 and acting at age 12. Machado attended college for a year and half but left to pursue modeling and appearing in commercials.

==Career==
Machado won the 1995 Miss Maracay pageant, and then the 1995 Miss Venezuela pageant representing Yaracuy state and then the Miss Universe 1996 crown in Las Vegas. Early in her training, she refused plastic surgery recommended to her, notable in Venezuelan beauty pageant culture. The runner-up, Jacqueline Aguilera, also won the Miss World 1995 crown, marking the second time that two Venezuelans from the same pageant won two world titles. Machado&#x27;s reign came as American businessman Donald Trump took ownership of the Miss Universe pageant. While preparing for Miss Universe, Machado underwent intense dieting. Machado said that, when she won, she weighed 116 pounds and was anorexic and bulimic.

During her reign as Miss Universe, Machado gained what she said was about 12 pounds in weight, drawing considerable press attention. The President of Miss Universe Organization denied that the organization was considering replacing her with runner-up, Taryn Mansell of Aruba. After mounting pressure to lose weight from Trump and other pageant officials, Machado asked Trump to assist her with orienting toward a healthier lifestyle. Trump arranged for 80 reporters to &quot;watch [her] sweat&quot; in a gym, which Machado later called &quot;in very bad taste&quot;. This scandal catapulted her directly to world fame, making her the most popular Miss Universe in history.

In 1998 Machado had her first starring telenovela role as the title character in Samantha. In 2001, she had a small role on the international soap opera &quot;Secreto de Amor&quot;. During 2004–2005, she pursued a career as a TV commercial model with particular success in promoting a dieting product.

In 2005, Machado appeared on a Spanish reality show called La Granja de los celebrities, whose participation generated headlines in the press in Spain, Mexico, Miami and Venezuela, for having sex in front of the cameras with his partner on the program Fernando Acaso, when She was still engaged to Venezuelan baseball player Bob Abreu. On February 19, 2006, Machado debuted on the Mexican reality show &quot;Cantando Por Un Sueño&quot; (&quot;Singing For A Dream&quot;).

Machado appeared in (and on the cover of) the February 2006 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mexican edition, becoming the only Miss Universe to pose nude for that magazine. Machado was cast in the comedic soap opera &quot;Una familia con suerte&quot; where she played a woman who fell in love with her brother&#x27;s enemy. The show began airing in Mexico in February 2011 and in the United States in October of that same year. She again posed nude for the July 2010 issue of the Mexican edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

On September 9, 2012, Machado was one of ten competitors on the third season of &quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot;. On November 18, 2012, Alicia won 3rd place in the 3rd season of Univision&#x27;s dance competition Mira Quien Baila. In 2013, Machado starred as the protagonist of &quot;La Madame&quot;, a television serial produced by RTI Productions and RCN TV in Colombia. In February 2014, she joined Univision&#x27;s beauty pageant Nuestra Belleza Latina 2014 as a mentor where she coach the participants on how to succeed in the modeling and television industry.

In 2017, she posed nude for PETA&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur,&quot; ad campaign.

In 2019 she was part of the cast of the play Divinas, she also participated in the Latin movie, He matado a mi marido ( I have killed my husband).

In 2021 she competed in the Colombian version of the MasterChef Celebrity

On May 23, 2021, she premiered her celebrity interview show Whats Up Alicia, produced by Machado. It will initially be broadcast in Venezuela, through Venevisión, to later be launched in other countries in Latin America such as Mexico, and the United States.

In 2021, Machado appeared as a contestant in the first season of the reality television series &quot;La casa de los famosos&quot;. She went on to win the competition with 40,586,129 votes.

== Involvement in politics ==

In 1998, Machado publicly supported the presidential campaign of Henrique Salas Römer. In 2010 she criticized populist Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;.

In July 2015, after Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, Machado announced that she would publish a book detailing what she called his &quot;abuses of power&quot; and &quot;racism&quot;. She said that, during her year as Miss Universe, Trump called her &quot;Miss Piggy&quot; because she gained weight and &quot;Miss Housekeeping&quot; because of her Hispanic background. Trump&#x27;s spokeswoman denied that Trump had made those insults. Machado has repeatedly called Trump a &quot;nazi rat&quot;, compared him to Hugo Chavez and Adolf Hitler, and said that he was capable of starting a new Holocaust.

On September 26, 2016, Hillary Clinton brought up Machado&#x27;s statements against Trump during the first presidential debate. The following day, Trump responded on &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, describing Machado as &quot;impossible&quot; and saying that &quot;she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her.&quot; Later that week, Trump made a series of tweets in which he called her &quot;disgusting,&quot; condemned Clinton&#x27;s judgement for not &quot;checking her past&quot;, falsely claimed she had appeared in a &quot;sex tape&quot;, and baselessly accused Clinton of using her influence to help Machado become an American citizen.

The tweets were condemned in editorials in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. John Cassidy of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Trump&#x27;s &quot;original comments about Machado reeked of sexism and racism&quot; while his subsequent series of tweets &quot;highlighted, anew, his impulsiveness and lack of discipline.&quot; The following day, Clinton telephoned Machado to thank her for her support.

Beginning in June 2016, Machado publicly campaigned in support of Hillary Clinton. The Clinton campaign coordinated many of her media appearances, featured her in two online advertisements, and used her to introduce Clinton at a campaign rally.

==Personal life==
In 1998, a Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him while he was presiding over a case against her then-boyfriend for attempted murder. Machado was also accused of driving the boyfriend&#x27;s getaway car. Machado denied both accusations and was never charged with a crime. The controversy caused a media sensation in Venezuela unseen since the conviction of President Carlos Andres Perez.

Machado once dated professional baseball player Bobby Abreu; the couple later split, calling off their engagement.

In 2010, responding to being mocked on Twitter after mistakenly referring to North and South Korea as China, Machado closed her Twitter account and wrote, &quot;I now have a lot of psychopaths on the account and it&#x27;s best I start another one, kisses.&quot;

Machado has one daughter. In 2013, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, Machado underwent a double mastectomy.

In May 2016, Machado became a U.S. citizen.

In June 2019 in statements to the Hispanic show business program, &quot;Suelta la sopa&quot;, she talked about her bisexuality, claiming to have had girlfriends.

<doc id="693482" wikidata="Q382992" url="?curid=693482" title="David C. Jewitt">
<text>David Clifford Jewitt (born 1958) is a British-American astronomer who studies the Solar System, especially its minor bodies. He is based at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he is a Member of the Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics, the Director of the Institute for Planets and Exoplanets, Professor of Astronomy in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and Professor of Astronomy in the Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences. He is best known for being the first person (along with Jane Luu) to discover a body beyond Pluto and Charon in the Kuiper belt.

== Early life ==
Jewitt was born in London, England, in 1958. His mother was a telephonist, and his father worked on an assembly line making industrial steel cutters. The family lived with Jewitt&#x27;s grandmother in a social housing project in the north London suburb of Tottenham.

Jewitt&#x27;s interest in astronomy was kindled in 1965, when he chanced to see some bright meteors. Media coverage of NASA&#x27;s Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 lunar missions in 1968 and 1969 added to his enthusiasm. His own exploration of outer space began with a tabletop 40 mm refracting telescope that his grandparents gave him as a birthday present. Upgrading to a 150 mm reflector built by his uncle Malcolm and then a homemade 250 mm instrument, Jewitt became a serious amateur astronomer while still a schoolboy. He joined the Transient lunar phenomenon subsection of the Lunar Section of the British Astronomical Association, and regularly contributed reports of his observations to the Section&#x27;s circular.

== Education ==
Jewitt was educated at local authority primary and secondary schools. He was also an autodidact, borrowing books from a travelling library to supplement the few that his parents could afford to buy for him. His interest in physics began when a teacher introduced him to the subject, of which he had never previously heard, when he was twelve or thirteen.

In 1976, supported by a local authority grant, Jewitt enrolled at University College London to take courses in astronomy, physics, mathematics, computing, electronics, metalwork and technical drawing, studying both at UCL&#x27;s Gower Street campus and at the UCL Observatory (then called the University of London Observatory) in Mill Hill. The module that he enjoyed most was a panoramic survey of physics delivered by the Christian, Rolls-Royce-driving space scientist Professor Sir Robert Boyd. Together with his friend, the future poet and environmental activist Roly Drower, Jewitt graduated with a first class honours B.Sc. in astronomy in 1979.

Following the advice of UCL&#x27;s Professor Michael Dworetsky, Jewitt decided to pursue his postgraduate studies at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He became an Anthony Fellow at Caltech in 1979, achieving an M.S. in planetary science in 1980. After investigating planetary nebulae and comets with the 200 inch Hale Telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory, working with Ed Danielson and Gerry Neugebauer under the supervision of Professor James Westphal, he was awarded a Ph.D. in planetary science and astronomy in 1983. He has recalled his adventures in the Hale&#x27;s vertiginous prime focus cage as occasionally a risk to life and limb.

== Career ==
In 1983, Jewitt became an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1988, attracted by the powerful telescopes sited on Mauna Kea, he moved to the University of Hawaii, becoming an Associate Astronomer in its Institute of Astronomy and an associate professor in its Department of Physics and Astronomy. In 1993, the Institute promoted him to the rank of Astronomer &quot;tout court&quot;.

In 2009, Jewitt returned to the American mainland to work at the University of California, Los Angeles, becoming a Member of UCLA&#x27;s Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics and a professor in what was then its Department of Earth and Space Sciences. In 2010 he was given a second chair, becoming a professor in UCLA&#x27;s Department of Physics and Astronomy. In 2011, he became the Director of UCLA&#x27;s Institute for Planets and Exoplanets.

== Research ==
Jewitt&#x27;s research interests have embraced many topics in planetary science, including the Kuiper belt, circumstellar discs, planetary ring systems, the physical properties of comets, frozen volatiles in asteroids, the moons of the gas giant planets and the formation and evolution of the Solar System.

In 1992, after five years of searching, Jewitt and the Vietnamese-American astronomer Jane X. Luu discovered 15760 Albion, the first Kuiper belt object (other than Pluto and its largest moon Charon) to be detected. Jewitt and Luu named the object after a character who features in the mythological poetry of William Blake, a writer whom Jewitt admires. (Blake in turn took the name from an ancient poetic term for Jewitt&#x27;s native England.) Jewitt and Luu would have preferred to name the object Smiley after the protagonist of John le Carré&#x27;s novel &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;, a favourite book of both of theirs, but they were unable to do so because the name had already been allocated to the asteroid 1613 Smiley in honour of Charles Hugh Smiley, an American astronomer.

Since discovering 15760 Albion, Jewitt has identified dozens of other objects in the Kuiper belt in a series of pioneering wide field surveys. Thanks to his work and the efforts of other astronomers, it is now known that the Kuiper belt objects are divided into four distinct populations. In what is called the dynamically cold classical Kuiper belt, of which 15760 Albion is the prototypical member, objects have orbits that are almost circular and only slightly tilted with respect to the orbits of the major planets. In the dynamically hot classical Kuiper belt, objects have orbits that are more elongated and that are tilted at steeper angles. In the scattered disc, also called the scattered Kuiper belt, discovered in 1997, bodies move in large orbits that are more elongated and more tilted still. The Resonant Kuiper belt objects move in orbits that are harmonically related to that of Neptune: the ratio of the orbital period of a resonant object to the Neptunian year is equal to one small integer divided by another. (The resonant objects in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance Jewitt has named plutinos, in recognition of Pluto&#x27;s being the first of them to be discovered.) Mathematical models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System have indicated that in order for the Kuiper belt to have developed the structure that has been observed, the Kuiper belt objects and the gas giant planets must have come to their present orbits after migrating to them from elsewhere, pulled away from their earlier paths by their gravitational interactions with one another and with the disc of material that had coalesced around the juvenile Sun. In particular, it seems that Neptune long ago moved outward from an earlier orbit that was much closer to the Sun, and that the Kuiper belt objects, also originally closer to the Sun, were drawn outward with it.

In 1979, in his first months as a graduate student, Jewitt discovered the Jovian moon Adrastea on images taken by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. He has since discovered more than seventy further moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In 1982, he achieved worldwide fame as the first astronomer to recover Halley&#x27;s Comet as it approached its 1986 perihelion, detecting it with the Hale telescope using an early CCD. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of more than forty asteroids. The inner main-belt asteroid 6434 Jewitt, discovered by Edward Bowell in 1981, was named in his honour. In the naming citation, published on 1 July 1996, Jane Luu described Jewitt as &quot;the consummate astronomer&quot; ().

== Controversies ==
When Pluto was first discovered, it was added to the canonical list of major planets. After Jewitt and Luu&#x27;s discovery of 15760 Albion and the subsequent finding of many more Kuiper belt objects, it became apparent that Pluto had more in common with these objects than it did with its supposed planetary peers. Some astronomers suggested that Pluto should be demoted. Jewitt thought that the question of whether Pluto was a planet was &quot;essentially bogus&quot; and &quot;scientifically [...] a non-issue&quot;, but ultimately agreed with the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s 2006 decision to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf planet.

With the development of ever better telescopes and detectors, astronomers have been able to find moons that are ever smaller and smaller. Some astronomers have argued that moons smaller than some arbitrary size are unworthy of their title. Jewitt has dissented, asking &quot;Is a small dog not a dog because it is small?&quot;

== Outreach ==
In October 1982, Patrick Moore interviewed Jewitt about his recovery of Halley&#x27;s Comet in a special episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;. In November 1985, as the comet neared the Sun, Jewitt again described how he had recovered it in an episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; titled &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet – the Apparition&quot; (Season 22, Episode 17). A quarter of a century later, &quot;Horizon&quot; returned to Jewitt to interview him for &quot;Asteroids: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (Season 47, Episode 6). Jewitt told viewers that he had found it difficult to secure enough telescope time for his trans-Neptunian research, and had only been able to achieve his celebrated breakthrough by looking for Kuiper belt objects on nights when he was supposed to be working on other projects.

Jewitt has also explained his work to non-specialists in articles in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot; and &quot;The Sky at Night BBC Magazine&quot;.

== Honours ==
In 1994, Jewitt was awarded the University of Hawaii&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Medal for excellence in research. In 1996, the ARCS (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists) Foundation&#x27;s Honolulu chapter named him the Hawaii Scientist of the Year, and NASA gave him their Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal. In 1998, he was made an Honorary Fellow of University College London. In 2000, he became an Honorary Professor at the National Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Science. In 2005, he became a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2007, he was made an adjunct professor of the National Central University of Taiwan. In 2012, he was awarded the $1 million Shaw Prize for astronomy, jointly with his former student Jane X. Luu of MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratury, in recognition of their &quot;discovery and characterization of trans-Neptunian bodies, an archaeological treasure dating back to the formation of the solar system and the long sought source of short period comets&quot;. In 2012 too he was awarded the $1 million Kavli Prize for astrophysics, jointly with Luu and Michael Brown, for the same work. 2012 also saw his becoming a Foreign Member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

== Personal life ==
In 1991, Jewitt met Jing Li (a Chinese-American born in Beijing, China), a Ph.D. student of solar physics at the University of Paris, while she was visiting the University of Hawaii. Jewitt and Jing married in 1993. Their daughter, Suu Suu, was born in 2000.

As a child, Jewitt&#x27;s extra-astronomical interests included writing, history, music, machines, animals, trees, rocks and fossils. Among the pleasures of his mature years are the cult British TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and the music of the twentieth century modernist composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis. Jewitt remembers a visit of Xenakis&#x27;s to Caltech as a highlight of his years of working there.

In 2014, Jewitt was one of 365 eminent people invited to forecast the likely future of the Earth. He declared himself hopeful, deriving his optimism from his opinion that democracy had transcended dictatorship and science had transcended religion.

<doc id="693485" wikidata="Q19987583" url="?curid=693485" title="Alcaeus (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcaeus or Alkaios (Ancient Greek: Ἀλκαῖος derived from &quot;alke&quot; &quot;strength&quot;) was the name of a number of different people:
*Alcaeus, was a Mycenaean prince. He was a son of Perseus and Andromeda and thus the brother of Perses, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon, Cynurus, Gorgophone and Autochthe. Alcaeus was married either to Astydameia, the daughter of Pelops and Hippodamia, or Laonome, daughter of Guneus, or else Hipponome, daughter of Menoeceus, by whom he became the father of Amphitryon, Anaxo and Perimede.
*Alcaeus, the original name of Heracles (according to Diodorus Siculus), which was given to him on account of his descent from Alcaeus, the son of Perseus mentioned above.
*Alcaeus, a son of Heracles by a female slave of Iardanus, from whom the dynasty of the Heraclids in Lydia were believed to be descended. Diodorus Siculus writes that this son of Heracles is named &quot;Cleolaus&quot;.
*Alcaeus, a Cretan general of Rhadamanthus, according to Diodorus Siculus, who presented him with the island of Paros. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; relates that he was a son of Androgeus (the son of Minos and Pasiphaë) and brother of Sthenelus, and that when Heracles, on his expedition to fetch the girdle of Ares, which was in the possession of the queen of the Amazons, arrived at Paros, some of his companions were slain by the sons of Minos. Heracles, in his anger, slew all the descendants of Minos except Alcaeus and Sthenelus, whom he took with him, and to whom he afterwards gave the island of Thasus as their home.
*Alcaeus, son of Margasus and Phyllis, a Carian ally of the Trojans in the Trojan War. He was killed by Meges.

<text>Raphael Mitchel Robinson (November 2, 1911 – January 27, 1995) was an American mathematician.

Born in National City, California, Robinson was the youngest of four children of a lawyer and a teacher. He was awarded from the University of California, Berkeley in mathematics: the BA (1932), MA (1933), and Ph.D. (1935). His Ph.D. thesis, on complex analysis, was titled &quot;Some results in the theory of Schlicht functions&quot;.

In 1941, Robinson married his former student Julia Bowman. She became his Berkeley colleague and the first woman president of the American Mathematical Society.

Robinson worked on mathematical logic, set theory, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. In 1937 he set out a simpler and more conventional version of the John von Neumann 1923 axiomatic set theory. Soon after Alfred Tarski joined Berkeley&#x27;s mathematics department in 1942, Robinson began to do major work on the foundations of mathematics, building on Tarski&#x27;s concept of essential undecidabilility, by proving a number of mathematical theories undecidable. In 1950 Robinson proved that an essentially undecidable theory need not have an infinite number of axioms by coming up with a counterexample: Robinson arithmetic &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; is finitely axiomatizable because it lacks Peano arithmetic&#x27;s axiom schema of induction; nevertheless &quot;Q&quot;, like Peano arithmetic, is incomplete and undecidable in the sense of Gödel. Robinson&#x27;s work on undecidability culminated in his coauthoring Tarski et al. (1953), which established, among other things, the undecidability of group theory, lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras.

Robinson worked in number theory, even employing very early computers to obtain results. For example, he coded the Lucas–Lehmer primality test to determine whether 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 was prime for all prime &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2304 on a SWAC. In 1952, he showed that these Mersenne numbers were all composite except for 17 values of &quot;n&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281. He discovered the last five of these Mersenne primes, the largest ones known at the time.

Robinson wrote several papers on tilings of the plane, in particular a clear and remarkable 1971 paper &quot;Undecidability and nonperiodicity for tilings of the plane&quot; simplifying what had been a tangled theory.

Robinson became a full professor at Berkeley in 1949, retired in 1973, and remained active in his educational interests for the duration of his life having published late in his life:
* (age 80 years) &quot;Minsky&#x27;s small universal Turing machine&quot;, describing a universal Turing machine with four symbols and seven states;
* (age 83 years) &quot;Two figures in the hyperbolic plane&quot;.

<text>Antonio Caldara ( – 28 December 1736) was an Italian Baroque composer.

== Life ==
Caldara was born in Venice (exact date unknown), the son of a violinist. He became a chorister at St Mark&#x27;s in Venice, where he learned several instruments, probably under the instruction of Giovanni Legrenzi. In 1699 he relocated to Mantua, where he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; to the inept Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, a pensionary of France with a French wife, who took the French side in the War of the Spanish Succession. Caldara removed from Mantua in 1707, after the French were expelled from Italy, then moved on to Barcelona as chamber composer to Charles III, the pretender to the Spanish throne (following the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 without any direct heir) and who kept a royal court at Barcelona. There, he wrote some operas that are the first Italian operas performed in Spain. He moved on to Rome, becoming &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; to Francesco Maria Marescotti Ruspoli, 1st Prince of Cerveteri. While there he wrote in 1710 &quot;La costanza in amor vince l&#x27;inganno&quot; (&quot;Faithfulness in Love Defeats Treachery&quot;) for the public theatre at Macerata.

With the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I from smallpox at the age of 32 in April 1711, Caldara deemed it prudent to renew his connections with Charles III – soon to become Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI – as he travelled from Spain to Vienna via northern Italy. Caldara visited Vienna in 1712, but found Marc&#x27;Antonio Ziani and Johann Joseph Fux firmly ensconced in the two highest musical posts. He stopped at the Salzburg court on his return journey to Rome, where he was well received (and to which he subsequently sent one new opera annually from 1716 to 1727). In 1716, following the death the previous year of Ziani and the promotion of Fux to &quot;Hofkapellmeister&quot;, Caldara was appointed &quot;&quot; to the Imperial Court in Vienna, and there he remained until his death.

Caldara composed more than 70 operas, more than 30 oratorios, and other works including motets and sonatas. Several of his compositions have libretti by Pietro Metastasio, the court poet at Vienna from 1729.

<text>Kirkjubæjarklaustur (Icelandic for &quot;church farm cloister&quot;, pronounced ; often referred to locally as just Klaustur) is a village in the south of Iceland on the hringvegur (road no. 1 or Ring Road) between Vík í Mýrdal and Höfn. It is part of the municipality of Skaftárhreppur and has about 500 inhabitants. It is surrounded by hills and plateaus to the north. Kirkjubæjarklaustur is roughly east of the capital city of Reykjavik.

==Location==
Kirkjubæjarklaustur is the only place between Vík and Höfn which offers services, which includes a fuel station, a bank, a post office and a supermarket. Nearby tourist attractions include the Laki craters, the Eldgjá and Skaftafell, all in Vatnajökull National Park. An attraction close to the village is &quot;Kirkjugólf&quot; (&quot;Church floor&quot;), a natural pavement of basalt. These are basalt columns in the earth, the visible tops of which have the appearance of a paved church floor. This lava formation has similar origins to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Ireland.

== History ==
Even before the time of the first Norse settlement in Iceland, Irish monks are thought to have lived here. Since 1186, a well known convent of Benedictine nuns, Kirkjubæjar Abbey, was located in Kirkjubæjarklaustur, until the Reformation in 1550. The names of the waterfall &quot;Systrafoss&quot; (&quot;waterfall of the sisters&quot;) and of the lake &quot;Systravatn&quot; (&quot;water of the sisters&quot;) on the highland above the village refer to this abbey. Folk tales illustrate the history with stories about good and sinful nuns. The &quot;Systrastapi&quot; (&quot;sister&#x27;s rock&quot;) is where two of the convent&#x27;s nuns were buried after being burned at the stake. One of the nuns was accused of selling her soul to the Devil, carrying Communion bread outside the church, and having carnal knowledge with men; the other was charged with speaking blasphemously of the Pope. After the Reformation, the second sister was vindicated, and flowers are said to bloom on her grave, but not that of the first nun. Systravatn also has a legend relating to the convent. According to the English text on the Katla Geopark sign next to the lake, the nuns frequently bathed in the lake, and one day two nuns saw a hand holding a gold comb reach out from the water. When they tried to seize the comb, they were dragged below the water and drowned.

The village became well known in Iceland during the Lakagígar volcano eruptions in 1783. The pastor of the local church and dean of Vestur-Skaftafellssýsla, (1728 – 1791), delivered what became known as the &quot;Fire Sermon&quot; (&quot;eldmessu&quot; ) on July 20, 1783. The legend says that this sermon stopped the lava flow, and the village was spared at the last moment. The current church, constructed in 1974, was built in memory of Rev. Jón.

Today, the village is an important service center for the farms in the region as well as for tourists and weekend visitors. Many people from Reykjavík, the country&#x27;s capital, have weekend huts by a nearby lake.

Some filming for Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2014 movie &quot;Interstellar&quot; took place in and around Klaustur. The filmmaker, actors and crew reportedly filled up all of the hotel rooms in Klaustur when shooting was happening.

== Climate ==
Kirkjubæjarklaustur has a subarctic climate according to the koppen-geiger classification with warm, short summers and long, mild winters.

In January Kirkjubæjarklaustur&#x27;s average temperature is approximately . In July the average temperature is . The highest temperature ever recorded was on June 22, 1939, whilst the lowest temperature ever recorded was on February 6, 1969.

<text>Chrononauts is a family of card games that simulates popular fictional ideas about how time travellers might alter history, drawing on sources like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and the short stories collection &quot;Travels Through Time&quot;. The game was designed by Andrew Looney and is published by Looney Labs. The original game and a variant each won the Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game.

==History==
The game was designed by Andrew Looney of Looney Labs in 2000. In 2001, &quot;Chrononauts&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Traditional Card Game of 2000&quot; and Parents&#x27; Choice Silver Honors 2001 Games.

The game&#x27;s first expansion, &quot;Lost Identities&quot; was released in 2001. In 2004, Looney Labs released &quot;Early American Chrononauts&quot; (&quot;EAC&quot;), a prequel version of &quot;Chrononauts&quot;, and introduced &quot;Gadgets,&quot; a new card type.

The game&#x27;s second edition was published in 2009. &quot;The Gore Years&quot; expansion set was issued that year also. Released on September 11, 2010, &quot;Back to the Future: The Card Game&quot; variant re-implemented the system to match the movies. This variant won 2011 Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game. In 2013, EAC was reprinted.

A second expansion set &quot;The Rest of Row E Expansion&quot; was released in 2024. 

==Gameplay==
&quot;Chrononauts&quot; is played with a specially designed set of 136 (in the Third Printing) or 140 cards (in version 1.4). There are 32 &quot;Timeline&quot; cards that form the game board (with four tiers of eight cards), plus &quot;ID&quot; and &quot;Mission&quot; cards describe goals for the players, and 80-84 &quot;Chrononauts&quot; cards providing &quot;Artifacts, Actions, Gadgets, Inverters, Patches, and Timewarps&quot;, making up the deck from which players draw. Gadgets were added with the &quot;Early American Chrononauts&quot; variant and grant special actions.

The 32 timeline cards represent significant events in (real) history of two types: Linchpins and Ripple Points. Players use Inverters to directly change the Linchpin events, changing to the alternative event on the reverse side of the timeline card. Changing a Linchpin also turns over one or more Ripple Point cards, exposing paradoxes. Player can use a Patch to resolve the paradox. The timeline mechanic with linchpins and ripple points was patented by Looney in 2002.

The game can be won in one of three ways:
#&quot;Return Home&quot;: The timeline can be altered so that certain events happen as described on a player&#x27;s ID card and involves 2 patches and one linchpin.
#&quot;Complete the Mission&quot;: Each player has a Mission card detailing a set of Artifacts that can be retrieved through time travel. If a player collects all three artifacts that meet the mission conditions by the end of their turn, the player gets paid off by a rich eccentric and is able to retire.
#&quot;Become a Time Enforcer&quot;: Each time a player plays a Patch, he/she immediately draws an extra card. A player whose hand contains 10 or more cards at the end of his/her turn gets recruited to protect the timeline.
If there are ever 13 or more unpatched paradoxes on the timeline, then the universe is destroyed and all players lose.

The game comes with two other game rules, Solonauts (a solitaire version) and Artifaxx (a Fluxx-like variant). The &quot;Chrononauts&quot; and &quot;EAC&quot; timelines can be interconnected to create a third game, &quot;ÜberChrononauts&quot;, which requires players to satisfy all three winning conditions, although not simultaneously, to win the game. The original Über rules were found in the EAC set on a card, with updated rules on Wunderland.com.

===&quot;Back to the Future&quot;===
&quot;Back to the Future: The Card Game&quot; (BttF) comes with 100 cards of which there are 24 Timeline cards, 10 ID cards and the rest game cards. The game cards consist of items, time machines, doubleback, action and power action cards. Similar to Chrononauts, BttF lays out the timeline cards on the table to make a board with each era in the movies group together. Each player randomly gets an ID card which gives goals, or timeline changes need to make sure that future character exists. To lock in the goal and win, the player must go back in time and stop Doc Brown from inventing time travel. The license for this game expired in 2012 and it is no longer being produced.

==Reception==
The reviews of &quot;Chrononauts&quot; leans towards the positive. Gamers at BoardGameGeek.com gave the game an average rating of 6.23 (out of 10) as of March 22, 2016. Out of the Box columnist Kenneth Hite wrote:
And I do love all that, but the game itself needs more of the first part and less of the &#x27;scavenger hunt through time&#x27; aspect that unfortunately dominates game play — the various victory conditions are mechanically unbalanced, leading to a de-emphasis of the time changing mechanic that is Looney&#x27;s best idea for this game.
Spotlight on Games&#x27; 1001 Nights of Gaming review sub-site gave the game a personal rating of 6 as it has some well designed ID goals while others are &quot;poorly integrated&quot; and considered the draw-discard turn and wait to be &quot;hardly edifying&quot;.
The cards do have a lot of nice thematic information however and the design of the various events and alternate realities must have been a labor of love. It&#x27;s just too bad that the same kind of ingenuity wasn&#x27;t put into the game play. As a two-player game this works somewhat, but tends to be better with more as otherwise it can degenerate into long sequences of simply reversing the other&#x27;s move.
At Board Game Quest, Tony Mastrangeli found that &quot;Explaining the linchpin/ripple point mechanic takes some work&quot; and &quot;There aren&#x27;t many time travel games out there for some reason, but Chrononauts is probably one of my favorites. It&#x27;s easy to learn, plays quickly, very portable and really inexpensive.&quot; Mastrangeli gave it 3 or 5 stars, calling it &quot;A fun card game that has a great theme and is on the meatier side of the filler game category&quot;.

Reviewing version 1.4 with &quot;The Gore Years&quot; expansion, Jonathan H. Liu of GeekDad said, &quot;If you like the idea of time travel, Chrononauts is a fun way to play with it&quot;. Liu doesn&#x27;t recommend the Artifaxx variant rule set except for younger players. Also reviewing the game with the Gore expansion, Meople&#x27;s Magazine rated the game over all a 7. Brian Thomas Clements reviewed &quot;The Gore Years&quot; expansion by itself at Gamerati. He had mostly praise for the new timeline except for an out of step patch card regarding Sarah Palin&#x27;s rise to the national stage. Clements stated, &quot;...Chrononauts: The Gore Years is a great addition to Chrononauts. It continues the historical trends of the previous game smoothly and logically (mostly), and can be easily integrated into the original game and ÜberChrononauts as well.&quot; He expects future expansions.

Early American version&#x27;s average rating at Board Game Geek.com is 6.63 as of March 22, 2016. Spotlight on Games&#x27; 1001 Nights of Gaming review sub-site gave EAC a personal rating of 6 and indicated a problem with the new gadget card: &quot;This is not so much a problem in the runaway leader sense as collecting three artifacts still seems the easiest way to win, but it can mean that this player&#x27;s turn starts to become very complicated and long, increasing downtime for others.&quot; Brad Weier posted a comped playtest review of the EAC version at RPG.net in which he considered its style to be &quot;Classy &amp; Well Done&quot; (4) and its substance to be &quot;Meaty&quot; (4). He also summarized, &quot;Like all of Looney Labs card games, EAC combines simple rules and fairly chaotic play into a fun and humorous package.&quot;

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; got a positive review from Jonathan H. Liu of GeekDad in which he states, &quot;Personally, I&#x27;m a fan of a lot of the Looney Labs games, and this one has a similar feel so I enjoyed it.&quot; Liu considered that the game is weak with 2 players.
