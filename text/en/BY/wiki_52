<text>Hartwell railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Camberwell, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It opened on 7 May 1906, with the current station building provided in 1938.

Initially opened as Hartwell Hill, the station was given its current name of Hartwell on 1 August 1909. It is the only station on the Alamein line to have an island platform.

==History==
When Hartwell station opened, it was served by a train consisting of a locomotive and one or two carriages, dubbed the &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot;, which operated between Ashburton and Deepdene stations. After the line from Camberwell to Ashburton was electrified in 1924, Hartwell was served by electric trains on the Ashburton line, which was extended to Alamein in 1948.

Hartwell is named after one of the early estates in the area, &quot;Hartwell House&quot;, the residence of James Irwin. In the mid-1850s, he owned and operated Irwin&#x27;s Hotel, which was on the corner of Norwood (now Toorak) and Wattle Valley roads, and was demolished about the time the railway line was built. In the 1850s, Hartwell was a small hamlet named after the nearby Back Creek. Minutes of meetings of the Boroondara District Roads Board noted that &quot;c/- Irwin Hotel, Back Creek&quot; was used as a polling station.

The station building was originally at Walhalla, the terminus of the Walhalla line, but was moved to Hartwell in December 1938, six years before the Walhalla line closed in 1944. Until the Alamein line was converted from single to double track in 1954 (to Ashburton) and 1955 (to Riversdale), Hartwell was the only crossing loop on the line.

On 27 December 1948, an Alamein-bound train was derailed at the Flinders Street (up) end of the station, near a set of points. While the track was blocked, a shuttle service was provided between Hartwell and Alamein, but passengers going beyond Hartwell had to take trams.

== Platforms and services ==
Hartwell has an island platform with two faces and is served by Alamein line trains.

Platform 1:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Camberwell

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Alamein

<text>Burwood railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Glen Iris, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Burwood station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 30 May 1890, with the current station provided in 1954.

Initially opened as Hartwell, the station was given its current name of Burwood on 1 August 1909, the same day as the current Hartwell station was given its name.

==History==
Burwood station opened on 30 May 1890 and, like the suburb itself, was named after &quot;Burwood House&quot;, built by Sir James Frederick Palmer in 1852.

Burwood was on the second section of the Outer Circle line. From May 1897 until July 1898, the station became disused following the closure of the line. However, after a public outcry, the line and the station were reopened, being served by what became known as the &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot;, a train consisting of one or two &quot;American-style&quot; carriages hauled by a steam locomotive.

In 1924, the line was electrified to the terminus at Ashburton. On 28 June 1948, the line was extended to Alamein, becoming the present-day Alamein line.

In 1954, the current station was provided, when duplication of the line occurred between Hartwell and Ashburton.

== Platforms and services ==

<text>Ashburton railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Ashburton, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ashburton station is a ground level premium station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 30 May 1890.

Initially opened as Norwood, the station was given its current name of Ashburton on 12 December 1890. Situated immediately north of the station, the double track becomes single for the rest of the section to Alamein.

==History==
Ashburton station opened on 30 May 1890, and was on the first section of the Outer Circle line. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Ashburton Terrace in Cork, Ireland, where councillor E. Dillon, who suggested the name, had previously lived.

By 1893, the northern half of the Outer Circle line had been closed and, on 9 December 1895, the line beyond Ashburton, connecting with Oakleigh was closed as well. For a short period, that left the line from Camberwell to Ashburton as the only remaining stretch of the Outer Circle line.

On 1 May 1897, Ashburton closed, along with the line from Camberwell. After an outcry from the local community, that section of the line reopened on 4 July 1898, becoming the Ashburton line once again. The line was electrified on 30 October 1924 but, in the years leading up to that, it was served by the popularly-named &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot;, which ran a shuttle between Ashburton and Deepdene, and usually consisted of an F-Class engine and one or two American-type carriages. When the track was extended 600 metres to a new terminus at Alamein, on 28 June 1948, the Ashburton line became the Alamein line.

In 1977, a signal panel was provided in the station building. The Train Staff and Ticket safeworking system to Alamein was also abolished in that year.

A siding is located at the Flinders Street (up) end of the station. In July 1989, timetabled use of the siding ended, due to the vandalising of trains stabled there. However, from time to time, maintenance trains use the siding during track works.

On 1 February 1996, Ashburton was upgraded to a premium station. Also occurring in that year, the station was the first on the metropolitan railway system where the former Metcard ticketing system was trialled.

==Platforms and services==
Ashburton has one platform and is served by Alamein line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Alamein; weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Camberwell

==Transport links==
Ventura Bus Lines operates one bus route via Ashburton station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<text>Alamein railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Alamein line, serving the eastern Melbourne suburb of Ashburton in Victoria, Australia. Alamein is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 28 June 1948.

==History==

Alamein station opened on 28 June 1948, and was the last station to be built on what is now the line of the same name. It opened on the reservation of the former Outer Circle line. The section on which Alamein is now located was closed to all traffic in 1895.

The station served a new Housing Commission estate that had been constructed for people who were displaced after World War II. The station still bears the name of the estate, which in turn had been named after the World War II battlefield in North Africa. It opened without much fanfare; there was no official ceremony from the Victorian Railways, local politicians or local councillors. Only 103 tickets were sold up to 10:30 a.m. on the first day of operations.

On 31 December 1956, an incident involving Swing Door driving trailer 10D and motor 155ABM occurred at the station after 10D, which was the leading car of the 16:29 service from Camberwell, overshot the platform and crashed into a timber buffer at the down end of the platform. 10D derailed in the incident as it pushed down on the buffer, before lifting upwards and coming to a stop leaning on an angle and a few metres away from a stanchion. There were no injuries reported from the fifteen people in 10D. At the time, the cause of the crash was due to faulty brakes.

During the 2011/2012 financial year, it was the 8th least used station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 153,000 passenger movements.

== Platforms and services ==

Alamein has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Alamein line services.

Platform 1:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Camberwell

==Transport links==

The Outer Circle Trail for cyclists and walkers continues along the Outer Circle alignment after Alamein as far as Gardiners Creek and the Malvern Valley Public Golf Course. It then connects with the Gardiners Creek Trail and a path to East Malvern.

<text>Ringwood East railway station is a commuter railway station on the Lilydale line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Ringwood East in Victoria, Australia. Ringwood East is a below ground unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms, connected by a ground level concourse. It opened on 18 May 1925, with the current station provided in 2024.

== History ==
In 1975, the former ground-level station building were provided.

On 30 June 1984, an island platform was provided, as part of the duplication of the line between Ringwood and Croydon. In that same year, boom barriers were provided at the former Dublin Road level crossing, which was located nearby in the up direction of the station.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the level crossing will be grade separated by 2025, with a rail trench to be built underneath the road. The level crossing removal will also involve the construction of a new station. In May 2023, construction on the project began.

On 24 May 2024, Dublin Road level crossing and equipment was eliminated. At the same night, the old ground-level Ringwood East station was closed and demolished. Initially, Ringwood East station was originally scheduled to open to passengers on 5 July 2024. However, the opening was delayed and postponed to 8 July.

== Platforms and services ==

Ringwood East has two side platforms. The station is within Myki ticketing Zone 2, and is located between Railway Avenue and Patterson Street in the centre of Ringwood East. The station also has 330 car parking spaces.

<text>Mana ERG was the musical project of ex recording engineer and multi-instrumentalist Bruno De Angelis. Born in Rome and grown up in London, he gained experience by recording and producing bands playing very different genres. This had a direct influence on his music, a genre-defying blend of industrial, ethereal, ebm, electronica, and rock elements.
Bruno&#x27;s closest collaborators, who also assisted him in the production, were Joe Erber (piano and keyboards) and Tiberio (guitars), but quite often they were joined by special guests such as soprano Deborah Roberts, who, with her crystal clear and yet warm vocals, added an ethereal and dream-like touch to the sound. Other notable friends and collaborators were sound manipulator Antonym, Russian composer Artemiy Artemiev, Dieter Moebius, and Attrition&#x27;s mastermind Martin Bowes. The band ceased activities in 2011.

<text>Croydon railway station is a commuter railway station on the Lilydale line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Croydon in Victoria, Australia. Croydon is an elevated premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 December 1882, with the current station provided in 2024.

Initially opened as Warrandyte, the station was given its current name of Croydon on 1 August 1884.

== History ==
Croydon station opened on 1 December 1882 as Warrandyte, when the railway line from Camberwell was extended to Lilydale. It was renamed Croydon on 1 August 1884, like the suburb itself, the station was named after Croydon in Surrey, England. The name was suggested by local landowner Gregory Lacey, whose wife was originally from Croydon. The station was built on parts of land owned by Lacey.

Electrification was completed from Ringwood to Croydon by November 1924, and from Croydon to Lilydale by November 1925. A since-removed level crossing in the down direction of the station was provided at Main Street, with automated wig-wag signals installed in June 1928.

In 1957, the line between Croydon and Mooroolbark was duplicated, with a number of sidings provided at the same time. In 1978, the goods yard was closed and, in that same year, a number of sidings were abolished.

In May 1979, the Main Street level crossing was closed to traffic and replaced with a since-removed level crossing at Coolstore Road, located in the down direction of the station and protected with automated boom gate barriers and flashing signals.

On 30 June 1984, the former ground level Platform 1 opened, as part of the duplication of the line between Croydon and Ringwood. The remaining sidings were also abolished during this time. On 31 July 1996, Croydon was upgraded to a premium station.

On 7 February 2019, Michael Sukkar MP announced on behalf of the Federal Government that $15 million would be spent to provide multistorey commuter car parking facilities at Croydon, as part of the controversial Urban Congestion Fund. Construction of the now-$20 million project located at Devon St was undertaken by Kane Constructions on behalf of Maroondah City Council. The building is designed to enable future conversion into transit-oriented development, and incorporates environmentally sustainable design initiatives including solar PV power generation and rainwater harvesting and re-use, achieving a 5-star NABERS rating. A total of 402 parking spaces opened on 15 December 2021. The ground floor of the facility provides 83 spaces of general 3-hour time-limited parking, 6 accessible parking spaces, 4 all-day motorcycle parking spaces, bicycle parking (4 outdoor hoops and an indoor cage), 4 electric vehicle charging spaces, and a 1400m2 single-storey commercial office space currently occupied by The Orange Door family and domestic violence support service. Level 1 and 2 of the facility provides a total of 294 all-day general car parking for commuters. This is in addition to surface commuter parking for 284 vehicles and 10 motorcycles in the station precinct, for a total of 578 commuter car parking spaces.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Coolstore Road level crossing will be grade separated by 2025, with a 687 metre long rail bridge to be built over the road. The level crossing removal will also involve the construction of a new station. On 6 August 2022, early concept designs were released. In March 2023, construction on the project began.

On 30 January 2024, Croydon station closed temporarily to allow construction to take place, with the station buildings and Platform 2 demolished in the following days.

On 7 May 2024, Coolstore Road level crossing and equipment was eliminated, with a new Croydon station opening to passengers on 12 August 2024. The new station provides entrances at both the western and eastern ends, 4 lifts, stairs, public toilets, a waiting room, and 2 elevated side platforms. A total of 92 bicycle parking spaces are provided at the new station, including 33 open-air bicycle parking hoops and a Parkiteer bicycle parking cage. A new 14-bay bus interchange opened on 11 November 2024.

<text>Mooroolbark railway station is a commuter railway station on the Lilydale line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Mooroolbark in Victoria, Australia. Mooroolbark is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 10 October 1887 with the current station provided in 2021.

The current rail-over-road Mooroolbark station structure was opened on 19 November 2021, as part of railway redevelopment works, including the Level Crossing Removal Project. A crossover is located at the up end of the station, which allows services to terminate and return. Mooroolbark also marks the end of the double track on the Lilydale line.

== History ==
Mooroolbark station opened on 10 October 1887 and, like the suburb itself, is named after an Indigenous word meaning &#x27;red earth&#x27;. The name came from a cattle run that was leased to John Gardiner, with the land stretching from Brushy Creek to Olinda.

In 1949, flashing light signals were provided at the former Manchester Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In 1981, a number of sidings at the station were abolished. In 1983, boom barriers were provided at the level crossing. In 1985, the former ground-level Platform 2 was provided, along with new track which allowed down trains to enter the platform. This was in conjunction with the provision of automatic signalling between Mooroolbark and Lilydale.

In June 2001, Mooroolbark was upgraded to a premium station.

In October 2013, three small shelters were provided at the ends of both former ground level platforms. Platform 1 had shelters at each end, while Platform 2 had one at the down (Lilydale) end. Both platforms also had a raised section installed, reducing the need for a wheelchair ramp to be used.

In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced the removal of the Manchester Road level crossing. In 2020, work commenced on the project, with a rail-over-road configuration. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2022, however, on 19 November 2021, the rebuilt station opened to passengers.

The original 1887 station building, removed as part of the level crossing removal works, was relocated to the Lilydale campus of Box Hill Institute for restoration. It is scheduled to be moved to Tarrawarra, on the Yarra Valley Railway.

==Platforms and services==

Mooroolbark has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Lilydale line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations services to Lilydale; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Lilydale

<text>Lilydale railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Lilydale line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of Lilydale in Victoria, Australia. Lilydale is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 1 December 1882, with the current terminus station and stabling provided in 2021.

Initially opened as Lillydale, spelling that matched the original township, the station was given its current name of Lilydale on the 15 May 1888.

== History ==
Lilydale station opened on 1 December 1882 as an extension of the railway line from Camberwell, which had been extended from Hawthorn in April of that year. The fare from Melbourne was 3s 6d (first class) and 2s 6d (second class), and a letter-writer to &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, &quot;Cyclops&quot;, claimed that with the fare from Melbourne to Box Hill being only 9d (first class), there would soon be a line of stage coaches waiting to take people to Lillydale, with the extra cost effectively being a check on the growth of the town.

The second station building, opening in 1888, was relocated to Yarra Junction in 1915, having been replaced by the current building. When the new elevated station was constructed during level crossing elimination works between 2020–2022, the old ground-level building was retained. Its former refreshment rooms are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Until it was truncated at Lilydale in 1980, the line continued to Healesville. The line between Yarra Glen and Healesville is now part of the Yarra Valley Railway. The track from Lilydale to Yarra Glen, including Coldstream and Yering, is being repurposed as a rail trail. The Yarra Valley Railway originally leased the entire line, but they discontinued their lease on the section from Lilydale to Yarra Glen because of the bad condition of the timber bridges in that section. On 10 December 1991, the line between Lilydale and Coldstream was officially booked out of service.

Also branching off at Lilydale was the Warburton line. It opened in 1901, and closed on 1 August 1965. The track was removed in the early 1970s, as was the bridge over the Maroondah Highway. Most of the right-of-way is still intact, and has been turned into the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail. The exception is the part of the line approximately 800 metres beyond where it branched off at Lilydale. Mount Lilydale Mercy College currently leases that part of the railway reserve, which runs through its property, being the only part of the former line that is obstructed.

Until 1967, a turntable also existed at the station.

In 1985, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Maroondah Highway level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station. Occurring in that year, a signal panel was provided at the station, which controlled Lilydale and Mooroolbark. It was abolished in September 2021, with control transferred to Ringwood.

On 29 November 1991, a Hitachi train set rolled away from the stabling yard for about 1.5 km towards Coldstream. It crashed through a wire fence and traversed the Beresford and Nelson Roads level crossings, and was about to climb a hill when it rolled back 300 metres. Police advised that only one of the four brakes on the train was engaged. A train driver was suspended due to the incident.

On 31 July 1996, Lilydale was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced it was planning the grade separation of the crossing at Maroondah Highway. In 2019, the designs were revealed. In 2020, work commenced on the project and, in late 2021, the level crossing was removed. The chosen method was to raise the railway line above the former level crossing. As part of the plans, the ground-level station building remained where it was, being heritage listed. The rail bridge on John Street was demolished, and the land between it and the level crossing became an activity zone located underneath the new station. On 19 November 2021, the rebuilt station opened.

<text>ASB Bank Limited, commonly stylised as ASB, is a bank owned by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, operating in New Zealand. It provides a range of financial services including retail, business and rural banking, funds management, as well as insurance through its Sovereign Limited subsidiary, and investment and securities services through its ASB Group Investments and ASB Securities divisions. ASB also operated BankDirect, a branchless banking service that provided service via phone, online, EFTPOS and ATMs only.

==History==
ASB was established in 1847 as the Auckland Savings Bank. The first meeting was held in the store of Campbell and Brown, and was attended by John Logan Campbell, Dr John Johnson, Rev Thomas Buddle, John Jermyn Symonds, John MacDougall, David Graham (a brother of Robert Graham), Robert Appleyard Fitzgerald, Thomas Forsaith, John Israel Montefiore, James Dilworth, Alexander Kennedy, and William Smellie Graham.

During the 1980s the association of savings banks amalgamated the local savings banks throughout New Zealand with ASB at their head, and adopted the name, ASB Trust Bank. In 1986, ASB withdrew from the Trust Bank and in 1987 became a full-fledged commercial bank under the name, ASB Bank. In 1988, the Government passed the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act, which enabled ASB to become a public company. In 1989, the owner of the bank, ASB Community Trust, sold 75% of the shares to Commonwealth Bank. In 1994, ASB purchased and amalgamated Westland Bank, another former savings bank, located on the South Island&#x27;s west coast, which enabled it to operate on a truly national basis. In 1999, ASB Group acquired Sovereign Limited, a life insurance company, and the retail stockbroking and fixed income operations of Warburg Dillon Read. In 2000, Commonwealth Bank bought the remaining 25% of ASB&#x27;s shares from the Trust. In 2005 the bank changed the ASB Bank brand to ASB to reflect the more integrated financial services provider that it had become.

In early July 2020, ASB announced that it would be closing nine branches while 25 branches would be moving to three day weeks due to a shift in demand for online services. The company will also hire 150 additional staff to provide specialist online support.

==Innovation==
The bank has won awards including NetGuide Award for best financial services site in 2006 and 2007, TUANZ Innovation Award for Financial Service in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005, and recently Canstar&#x27;s inaugural annual &#x27;Best Online Banking Award&#x27; in 2012.

ASB launched pago in November 2006, which is an electronic payment service that allows anyone with a New Zealand bank account to send cleared funds via mobile phone or the internet to another person or participating retailer in real-time. The technology has not succeeded in the way ASB hoped, with very little use and virtually no significant updates since 2010. ASB Securities, launched in 1999, remains the largest online broker in New Zealand in terms of trading volume and active customers.

The bank has found significant success by being the first to introduce innovative services and features to the New Zealand market.
ASB was the first bank in New Zealand to offer:
* internet banking (FastNet Classic in 1997)
* branches open seven days a week (1998)
* online share trading on both the Australian and New Zealand share-markets (via ASB Securities in 1999)
* banking via mobile phones (ASB Mobile in 1999)
* the ability for customers to stop receiving their paper statements (2003)
* banking via PDAs and browser-based mobile banking (2006)
* automatic rounding of transactions where the difference is put into a savings account (Save the Change in 2010)
* Facebook friend payments via ASB Mobile iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps (2012)
* a dedicated real estate app for iOS (ASB Property Guide in 2012)

==Advertising and sponsorship==

ASB has become known for using well-known characters in its advertising. The bank had a series of highly successful, award-winning commercials with the Ira Goldstein character (played by American actor Steve Mellor), a bumbling American banker sent to New Zealand to find out &quot;what makes that bank different&quot;. The ads were popular over an 11-year period. However, the campaign ended in 2010 as the bank moved to a new advertising agency from TBWA/Whybin.

In October 2011 the bank introduced the Experience ASB campaign with new advertising agency Droga5. The campaign featured voice overs by English actor Dame Judi Dench and allowed potential customers to &quot;test drive&quot; the bank before joining.

In July 2012 ASB left Droga5 for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. In February 2013 ASB launched a new advertising campaign featuring Brian Blessed playing a fictionalised version of himself encouraging New Zealanders to be proud of their achievements whether big or small.

The bank also supports the ASB Community Trust, which was formed in 1988 with an endowment from the sale of ASB to Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Bank. The Trust has distributed more than $745 million since 1988, mostly giving grants to the arts, sport, recreation, environment, heritage, health and social services areas, as well as funding capital projects in local communities around New Zealand.

ASB is the corporate sponsor and partner for a number of high-profile New Zealand organisations and events such as: 
* Hato Hone St John New Zealand
* Youthline
* New Zealand Red Cross
* ASB Classic
* Black Ferns, All Blacks and Rugby Aupiki
* ASB Polyfest - A four-day event in Auckland featuring over 9,000 student performers celebrating the culture of the Pacific and attracting an audience of over 90,000.
* Cyber Skills Aotearoa 
* Springboard Trust 
* New Zealand Falcons

The bank is also a major sponsor of several event venues in New Zealand:

* ASB Tennis Centre
* ASB Theatre Marlborough
* ASB Auckland Waterfront Theatre
* ASB Atrium and ASB Careers Centre at the University of Auckland&#x27;s Owen G. Glenn Building, home of the university&#x27;s Business School.

<text>Mitcham railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Mitcham, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Mitcham station is a below ground premium station, featuring two side platforms connected by a ground level concourse. It opened on 25 December 1882, with the current station provided in 2014.

==History==

Mitcham station opened on 25 December 1882, just over three weeks after the railway line from Camberwell was extended to Lilydale. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a farm property, &quot;Mitcham Grove&quot;, owned by Wiliam Slater, a local who grew roses and herbs. Another theory is that Mitcham was named after a property, &quot;Mitcham Heights&quot;, itself named after Mitcham in Surrey, England.

In 1953, flashing light signals were provided at the former Mitcham Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station.

Until the 1970s, a shunting yard and goods shed existed where the southern car park exists today. Tracks remained embedded in the car park surface of that time, enabling parking for the great majority of the time when trains did not use the yard. In 1979, the station was one of three used as trial sites for new bike lockers under the Melbourne Bicycle Strategy, either for occasional, monthly or quarterly hire. Also occurring in that year, boom barriers were provided at the former level crossing. By 1985, goods services to and from the station ceased.

In 1989, the former ground level station buildings were provided, when the former signal box was relocated into the new building. On 4 April 1996, Mitcham was upgraded to a premium station.

On 2 January 2014, the original ground level station closed, as part of the grade separation project to replace the Mitcham Road and Rooks Road level crossings. It was replaced by a new below-ground station that opened on 25 January of that year.

Until their removal due to the level crossing removals, a crossover and siding were located at the up end of the station.

Mitcham was due to receive an upgraded commuter car park, following a 2019 commitment by the federal government. However, this was scrapped in 2021.

== Platforms, facilities and services ==

Mitcham has two side platforms with a concourse above on ground level. The concourse features a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room, toilets and a café. Access to the platforms is provided by stairs, lifts and ramps.

The station is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Lilydale and Belgrave line services.

<text>Heatherdale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Ringwood, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Heatherdale station is a below ground host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 7 September 1958, with the current station provided in 2017.

==History==
Heatherdale station opened on 7 September 1958, and was named after the locality of the same name, itself named after &quot;Heatherdale&quot;, a farm that was owned by William Witt.

When the station opened, it was located west of the former Heatherdale Road level crossing, which was provided with boom barriers in that year.

In 2007, Heatherdale was upgraded as part of the EastLink tollway project, with the works funded by ConnectEast. Upgrades included extra parking spaces, upgraded lighting and security measures, a new pedestrian crossing at Heatherdale Road and construction of new station buildings. The original station buildings were demolished and new shelters built. New lighting and signage was also installed along the platforms. The station buildings from 2007 were demolished nine years later, due to the level crossing removal works.

In mid-2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced its intention to proceed with the grade separation of the Heatherdale Road level crossing, together with the rebuilding of the station. In September of that year, an alliance including Leighton Contractors, Aurecon and Hyder Consulting was formally awarded the contract. In early 2016, construction started on the project and, by early February 2017, the level crossing was removed. On 6 February of that year, the rebuilt station opened, and was relocated to the east of the former level crossing.

== Platforms, facilities and services ==
Heatherdale has two side platforms. There are three separate car parking areas that serve the station. One is just to the north of Platform 2 and is accessible from Heatherdale Road. A second car park is beside the railway line on the eastern side of Heatherdale Road, stretching towards EastLink and was redeveloped as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. The Heatherdale Road entrance no longer serves as an exit, but a new section has been added between the railway line and Maroondah Highway, and provides as the exit and entrance. A third parking area surrounds the power transmission pylons on Molan Street. A fourth car park, accessed from Newman Street, opened in June 2013, to replace the car parks that were removed at Mitcham during the Mitcham Road crossing removal works.

It is served by Lilydale and Belgrave line trains.

<text>Ringwood railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction point for the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Ringwood in Victoria, Australia. Ringwood is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform, connected by an accessible overground concourse. It opened on 1 December 1882, with the current station provided in 2016.

The original single story brick station buildings, located on Platform 3, are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and today function as the ticket and staff offices. The station was reopened in January 2016 as part of a multimillion dollar redevelopment of the Eastland Shopping Centre, Ringwood Town Square and Railway Place.

== History ==
Ringwood station opened on 1 December 1882, when the railway line from Camberwell was extended to Lilydale. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Ringwood in Hampshire, England.

In 1926, a signal box was provided at the station, and was located on Platforms 1 and 2. It has since been relocated to the bus interchange. Signals are now controlled from within the station building on Platform 3.

Stabling sidings are located at the down end of the station. The sidings closest to the Lilydale line were provided in 1973, and were extended in 1978, whilst in 1979, the sidings closest to the Belgrave line and the former Bedford Road level crossing were provided. In order to construct these sidings, the Belgrave line was temporarily slewed.

In 1982, duplication of the line to Bayswater was provided, with duplication of the line to Croydon occurring in 1984.

In 1994, siding &quot;A&quot; was abolished. On 31 July 1996, Ringwood was upgraded to a premium station. In 1999, a major signalling project took place at the station. The project included new sets of points to replace existing ones, upgrading of all signals and a new back platform constructed (Platform 1). Prior to the project, the track on the Platform 1 side was used as a siding, which continued to the Wantirna Road bridge.

In 2015, Ringwood was upgraded as part of the Eastland Shopping Centre 2015–2016 expansion (Stage 5), with the $66 million project completed in January 2016. The work included a new concourse, the provision of lifts, a reconfigured bus interchange, CCTV and heritage work on the station buildings. The station buildings themselves were not significantly altered, as they are heritage listed.

===Incidents and accidents===
In February 1908, EE class steam locomotive 478 overran the buffer stops at the Wantirna Road siding, derailed and toppled down the embankment, ending up level with the road.

On 29 January 1969, L Class electric loco L1157 ran away, crashing through the same buffer stops, and stopping with its front bogie dangling over Wantirna Road.

On 16 October 1989, a Comeng and a Hitachi train set collided 500m east of the station, near the Bedford Road level crossing. The collision occurred on a bend when the 07:11 train from Belgrave, led by Comeng 589M, collided with the rear of the 07:13 train from Upper Ferntree Gully, which was stationary at the time, derailing the Comeng train. 10 injuries were reported.

On 7 December 1992, a Comeng set overshot the same siding as in the 1908 accident, with leading car 392M crashing into and stopping on top of the buffers, near the edge of the Wantirna Road bridge.

On 12 May 2010, an X&#x27;Trapolis 100 set ran off the end of the tracks and into a fence in the Ringwood stabling yard.

<doc id="708000" wikidata="Q240141" url="?curid=708000" title="Regulation (European Union)">
<text>A regulation is a legal act of the European Union which becomes immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously. Regulations can be distinguished from directives which, at least in principle, need to be transposed into national law. Regulations can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter. Despite their name, Regulations are primary legislation rather than regulatory delegated legislation; as such, they are often described as &quot;Acts&quot; (e.g. the Digital Services Act).

==Description==
The description of regulations can be found in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC).

Article 288

To exercise the Union&#x27;s competences, the institutions shall adopt regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions.

A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.

A decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed.

Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force.

The Council can delegate legislative authority to the Commission and, depending on the area and the appropriate legislative procedure, both institutions can make laws. There are Council regulations and Commission regulations. Article 288 does not clearly distinguish between legislative acts and administrative acts, as is normally done in national legal systems.

==Legal effect==
Regulations are in some sense equivalent to the legislative acts of the member states, in the sense that what they say is law and they do not need to be mediated into national law by means of implementing measures. As such, regulations constitute one of the most powerful forms of European Union law and a great deal of care is required in their drafting and formulation.

When a regulation comes into force, it overrides all national laws dealing with the same subject matter and subsequent national legislation must be consistent with and made in the light of the regulation. While member states are prohibited from obscuring the direct effect of regulations, it is common practice to pass legislation dealing with consequential matters arising from the coming into force of a regulation.

Although a regulation in principle has a direct effect, the Belgian Constitutional Court has ruled that the international institutions, such as the EU, may not derogate from the national identity as set out in the political and constitutional basic structures of the country, or the core values of the protection of the Constitution.

<doc id="708001" wikidata="Q4874861" url="?curid=708001" title="Bayswater railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Bayswater railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Bayswater in Victoria, Australia. Bayswater is a below ground premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 4 December 1889, with the current station provided in 2016.

==History==
Bayswater station opened on 4 December 1889, when the railway line from Ringwood was extended to Upper Ferntree Gully. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after &quot;Bayswater House&quot;, a large property owned by bookmaker and publisher James John Miller. The property itself was named after Miller&#x27;s birthplace in London. During construction, the station was known as Macaulay, which was the name of a nearby post office.

In 1957, duplication of the line between Bayswater and Lower Fern Tree Gully occurred.

In 1970, boom barriers were provided at the former Mountain Highway level crossing, which was located in the up direction of the station. In 1977, the former ground-level station building was provided.

On 19 December 1982, the former ground-level island platform was provided, as part of the duplication of the line between Bayswater and Ringwood. In that year, boom barriers were provided at the nearby Scoresby Road level crossing, in the down direction from the station.

Bayswater was once the destination for freight services conveying cement, with the last train operating on 24 June 1987, after which the traffic was relocated to Lyndhurst, near Dandenong.

In April 1998, a train maintenance centre and stabling facilities opened adjacent to the station, as part of the replacement of the Jolimont Yard. The buildings are approximately 2,850 m2 in size, and permit bogie repair and replacement, and under-carriage and overhead work. In that year, a signal panel at the station was abolished and moved to Ringwood. In 2001, Bayswater was upgraded to a premium station.

In November 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced plans to remove the level crossings on either side of the station, at Mountain Highway and Scoresby Road. In conjunction with the grade separation, a new station was built below ground level. Between October and December 2016, the level crossings were removed. On 15 October of that year, the ground-level station closed, after which it was demolished to allow the new station to be built. On 12 December of that year, the new station opened to passengers.

== Platforms and services ==
Bayswater has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Belgrave line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave

<text>Boronia railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Boronia in Victoria, Australia. Boronia is a below ground premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 19 June 1920, with the current station provided in 1998.

== History ==

Boronia station opened on 19 June 1920, like the suburb itself, was named after a suggestion by local councillor Albert Chandler, who grew boronia plants for a nursery he owned nearby.

In 1952, flashing light signals were provided at the former Boronia Road level crossing, which was located in the down direction of the station. In 1957, duplication of the line between Bayswater and Lower Fern Tree Gully occurred, with a second platform provided at the former ground-level station. On 19 December 1959, the station was closed to all goods traffic.

In 1971, boom barriers were provided at the former level crossing. In 1985, the station was rebuilt, and included new station buildings and passenger facilities, as well as an upgrade to the bus interchange facilities. On 2 July 1996, Boronia was upgraded to a premium station.

In 1998, a new below ground station was built, as part of a grade separation project to remove the nearby Boronia Road level crossing. On 5 November of that year, the rebuilt station opened.

After extensive community activism, the Andrews government announced a $60 million upgrade of the station if re-elected at the 2022 state election. Boronia will be decked over to create new open space, as well as better connections to the surrounding shopping strips. The decking will also create direct pedestrian access from the car park to the Dorset Road shops, making it easier to get around central Boronia. The station facilities will undergo a major overhaul with building upgrades, improved lighting, CCTV, platform upgrades, accessibility upgrades and new furniture to create a modern station. The bus interchange will also receive new shelters, seating and signage.

==Platforms and services==

Boronia has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Belgrave line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave

<text>Ferntree Gully railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Ferntree Gully in Victoria, Australia. Ferntree Gully is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 5 December 1889, with the current station provided in 1976.

Initially opened as Lower Ferntree Gully, the station was given the name Ferntree Gully on 1 October 1962, before it was renamed Fern Tree Gully on 29 February 1972 and finally reverted back to its current name of Ferntree Gully in May 1977.

==History==

Ferntree Gully station opened on 5 December 1889, when the railway line from Ringwood was extended to Upper Ferntree Gully. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a fern tree gully that is located nearby in the Dandenong Ranges National Park.

In 1955, a goods siding at the station was abolished and, on 19 December 1959, the station was closed to all goods traffic. In 1963, flashing light signals were provided at the Alpine Street level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station.

In 1976, the current station buildings were provided, when the former signal panel was relocated into the new building. In 1977, the panel was abolished and, in that year, boom barriers were provided at the Alpine Street level crossing.

On 18 November 2008, it was announced that the station would be upgraded to a premium station. Work began in early 2009, and was completed by December of that year. On 31 July 2017, with a budget of $20 million, work began to add 215 new parking spaces at the station, which was completed by 1 December of that year.

South of the station, the double track railway becomes single track through to Belgrave.

== Platforms and services ==

Ferntree Gully has two side platforms. It is served by Belgrave line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave

<text>Upper Ferntree Gully railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Upper Ferntree Gully in Victoria, Australia. Upper Ferntree Gully is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 4 December 1889, with the current station provided between 1960 and 1962 respectively.

A number of services each day originate and terminate at Upper Ferntree Gully. The trains are stabled overnight in six of the seven sidings opposite the station.

==History==
Upper Ferntree Gully station opened on 4 December 1889, when the railway line from Ringwood was extended. After December 1900, it became the break-of-gauge station between the broad gauge used in most of Victoria, and the narrow gauge Gembrook line (now the Puffing Billy Railway), one of the five narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways. In 1954, the narrow gauge line was closed. However, the line as far as Belgrave was rebuilt as a broad gauge electrified railway, which opened on 18 February 1962.

On 21 November 1960, the current island platform and the stabling sidings to the north of the station were provided. In 1964, a signal panel was installed at the station. It controls the single-track line between Ferntree Gully and Belgrave. The station also monitors, via closed-circuit television, all stations from Heathmont to Belgrave, and answers emergency calls from those stations.

On 4 August 1975, the name of the station was altered slightly to Upper Fern Tree Gully, although in more recent times most references have reverted to the original name. In 1978, a siding and a number of points and dwarf signals at the station were abolished.

In 1985, boom barriers were provided at the Hilltop Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station. On 2 July 1996, Upper Ferntree Gully was upgraded to a premium station.

== Platforms and services ==
Upper Ferntree Gully has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Belgrave line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Belgrave

<text>Upwey railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Upwey in Victoria, Australia. Upwey is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 3 June 1901, with the current station provided in 1964. It initially closed on 30 April 1954, then reopened on 19 February 1962. 

The station is a crossing loop in the middle of a six-kilometre section of single track between Ferntree Gully and Belgrave.

==History==
Upwey station opened on 3 June 1901 and, like the suburb itself, was named after the homestead &quot;Upwey&quot;, which was named by a local family who purchased the property in 1897. The name itself comes from Upwey in Dorset, England, which is located on the River Wey.

Upwey was originally on the Upper Ferntree Gully – Gembrook narrow-gauge line. On 30 April 1954, the station, along with the rest of the line, was closed to traffic. On 19 February 1962, Upwey reopened, when the line as far as Belgrave was converted to broad gauge and electrified. On 17 March 1964, the current island platform was provided, when the present day Platform 2 was brought into use.

The 2010/2011 state budget allocated $83.7 million to upgrade Upwey to a premium station, but plans were cancelled by the Baillieu Government in 2011.

==Platforms and services==
Upwey has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Belgrave line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Ringwood

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Belgrave

<text>Tecoma railway station is a commuter railway station on the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Tecoma in Victoria, Australia. Tecoma is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 December 1924, with the current station provided in 1962. It initially closed on 30 April 1954, then reopened on 19 February 1962.

==History==
Tecoma station opened on 1 December 1924, on the narrow-gauge Ferntree Gully to Gembrook line, which was constructed as a means of transporting produce to and from the Dandenong Ranges area, and timber from sawmills in Gembrook. The station was named by the Victorian Railways, and was named after the plant Tecoma, which was grown in the area.

On 3 August 1953, a landslide occurred between Selby and Menzies Creek, which saw the closure of the line, and the station, on 30 April 1954. The sudden loss of the railway resulted in a groundswell of public pressure for the line to quickly reopen.

The formation of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society in 1955 saw services resume on the section of the line between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave, including Tecoma. Operations continued until 23 February 1958, after which the line between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave was converted to broad-gauge and electrified. On 19 February 1962, the station reopened.

The platform was used in a short cameo in the 2012 telemovie &quot;&quot;.

The station has been the second-least-used station in metropolitan Melbourne since the 2015/2016 financial year, and saw 73,957 passenger movements in the twelve months between June 2018 and July 2019. That equates to just over 200 passengers using the station each day, on average.

<doc id="708013" wikidata="Q158819" url="?curid=708013" title=".50 Action Express">
<text>The .50 Action Express (AE) (12.7×33mmRB) is a large-caliber handgun cartridge, best known for its usage in the Desert Eagle. Developed in 1988 by American Evan Whildin of Action Arms, the .50 AE is one of the most powerful pistol cartridges in production.

==Overview==
The actual cartridge has a base, with a rebated rim. The rim diameter of the .50 AE is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge. A Mark XIX Desert Eagle in .50 AE can be converted to .44 with nothing more than a barrel and magazine change.

The introduction of the .50 AE in the United States was met with a rocky start. Federal firearms statutes state that non-sporting firearms may not be over 0.500 inches in bore diameter (measured land to land) to meet Title I regulations. The original .50 AE bore diameter was .500 in, with conventional rifling, but the switch to polygonal rifling on production Desert Eagles allowed the gauge plug to drop through, rendering the gun a destructive device under Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) regulations. Actual bullet diameter was reduced to the current rather than the original thus the noticeably tapered case.

Recoil of the .50 AE in the Desert Eagle pistol is substantial, although only marginally more severe than the .44 Magnum, as the automatic mechanism and weight of the gun smooth the recoil somewhat. Other firearms chambered for the .50 AE include the AMT AutoMag V, the LAR Grizzly Win Mag, the Magnum Research BFR, and the Freedoms Arms Model 555.

==Performance==
SAAMI specifies a maximum chamber pressure of for the .50 AE. Available factory loads can produce nearly of muzzle energy.

==Use==
Like other handgun cartridges of such magnitude, the principal uses of the .50 AE are metallic silhouette shooting and medium/big game hunting. Like the .44 Magnum, .454 Casull, .460 S&amp;W Magnum, and .500 S&amp;W Magnum, it is also well suited for defense against large predators, such as bears. With heavier bullets, such as the TII Armory 400-grain and 460-grain offerings, the .50 AE closely matches the performance of the .480 Ruger and approaches the ballistics of the .500 Linebaugh.

==The .50 AE as a parent case==
The .50 AE is the parent case for the .440 Cor-Bon (1998) by Cor-Bon and the .429 DE (2018) by Magnum Research (a division of Kahr Firearms Group). Though similar, they are not interchangeable. Desert Eagle magazines for .50 AE cartridges can feed the derivative cartridges, but should be paired with barrels appropriate for their cartridge and caliber.

<text>Belgrave railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Belgrave line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Belgrave in Victoria, Australia. Belgrave is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 18 December 1900, with the current terminus station provided in 1962.

==History==
===Narrow gauge station===
Belgrave station originally opened on 18 December 1900 as Monbulk, and was renamed Belgrave on 21 November 1904. The station was on the Upper Ferntree Gully – Gembrook narrow gauge line, and was located approximately where the modern station car park is situated.

Following a landslide between Selby and Menzies Creek in the previous year, on 30 April 1954, the station closed, along with the rest of the line. From 9 April 1955 until 23 February 1958, the Victorian Railways resumed operations between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave, which was provided under a guarantee against losses by a citizens committee.

On 21 July 1962, a new station for the narrow gauge line was provided, along with the re-opening of the line as far as Menzies Creek as the Puffing Billy Railway. The Belgrave narrow gauge station is approximately 100 metres north of the metropolitan broad gauge station, and serves as the starting point for the Puffing Billy Railway. A short footpath under Belgrave-Gembrook Rd provides a pedestrian connection between the two stations. 

===Broad gauge station===
Belgrave station opened in its current configuration on 19 February 1962, after the line from Upper Ferntree Gully had been converted to broad gauge and electrified. The rebuilt station is located further down the line than the original narrow gauge station. 

In the early hours of 23 November 1989, Hitachi carriage 219M was destroyed in an arson attack whilst stabled at the station.

On 2 July 1996, Belgrave was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2018, the Victorian Government announced it would fund the construction of a multi-deck car park at the station, along with better pedestrian access and an improved bus interchange. Construction on the new four-storey, 670-space station began in March 2022, and was completed in January 2024. The new car park provides an additional 470 spaces, taking capacity from 170 to 670. This includes 16 accessible spaces, and 6 charging spaces for electric vehicles. 

Belgrave Station also provides a Parkiteer bicycle parking cage for up to 26 bicycles, in addition to casual open-air bicycle parking hoops. 

During the 2018/2019 financial year, the station had a patronage of 389,750.

<text>North Williamstown railway station is a commuter railway station on the Williamstown line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-western suburb of Newport, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. North Williamstown station is a below ground unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 February 1859, with the current station provided in 2021.

The Newport Railway Museum is located on nearby Champion Road, approximately 200 metres from the station.

==History==

North Williamstown station opened on 1 February 1859, just under a month after the railway line from Newport was extended to Williamstown Pier.

In 1967, manually operated boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Ferguson Street level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. In 1969, the boom barriers were converted to automatic operation, and the signal box for the level crossing was abolished.

The land that is located east of the station was once occupied by a strip of historic commercial premises, but is now used as car parking. Various proposals have been made by railway land manager VicTrack to subdivide this land for a high-density residential development.

The level crossing was a part of the first 50 crossings to be grade separated under the original scope of the Level Crossing Removal Project, which was promised by then opposition leader Daniel Andrews at the 2014 state election. In November 2019, the LXRP announced that consultation with the community for the project had started. On 19 June 2020, it was announced that the level crossing will be removed by lowering the railway line under the road, and will include rebuilding the station. On 11 October of that year, designs were released and, in January 2021, contracts were awarded. Major construction began in May 2021, with the station temporary closing on 2 August of that year. On 17 December of that year, the rebuilt station opened to passengers. As part of the project, the station building on Platform 2 was demolished, however the building on Platform 1 was retained for station operations.

==Platforms and services==

North Williamstown has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Williamstown line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston; all stations shuttle services to Newport

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Williamstown

<text>Williamstown railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Williamstown line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Williamstown, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Williamstown station is a ground level premium station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 17 January 1859.

The station building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, and is the second oldest railway station in Victoria, after St Kilda. It is also the oldest timber railway station building to survive in the state, and one of the earliest surviving timber public buildings in Victoria.

At the up end of the station platform, the double track railway converges into single track.

==History==

Work on the line started under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company, but were taken over by the government in 1856, after work faltered. Builders Kerr, Hodgson &amp; Billings commenced work on the timber station building in 1858, with the station opening to traffic on 17 January 1859. Arched bluestone road bridges were built over the cutting at Thompson and Cole Streets. Until 1987, the line continued around the bend to the now closed and demolished Williamstown Pier.

The central section of the station building remains today, but was originally flanked by two pavilions: one for the stationmasters residence, and the other pavilion was refreshment rooms. A now removed timber and iron verandah lined the street side of the station, while on the rail side, the original platform canopy extended along the platform much further.

The Ann Street footbridge was installed c1883, and on electrification in 1916, the Thompson Street overpass arch was removed and replaced with girder spans, to provide increased clearance.

Railway sidings, a signal box and weighbridge were once located opposite the station, but have been since removed, with a portion of the goods yard out of use by 1965. By June 1988, the majority of the sidings were removed. By October of that year, all rails, sleepers, overhead wires and signals between Williamstown and Williamstown Pier were removed, along with a further two electrified sidings, next to the platform track. The track now currently ends just under the Ann Street footbridge, at the down end of the station.

On 18 June 1996, Williamstown was upgraded to a premium station.

<text>The Eastern Suburbs is the eastern metropolitan region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

==Location==
Informally, references to &quot;eastern suburbs&quot; are often limited only to the area east of the Sydney Central Business District, one of the earliest areas developed beyond the town centre. However, the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney in the more expansive sense refers to the whole area situated to the east and south-east of the Sydney central business district, around the southern shore of Sydney Harbour to the Pacific Ocean beaches and continuing on to the port at Botany Bay and La Perouse. The region is sometimes defined as all of the suburbs within local government areas of the Municipality of Woollahra, Waverley Council and City of Randwick as well as eastern parts of Bayside Council and City of Sydney. Some suburbs in the City of Sydney and Bayside Council which are south of Central station, west of the Eastern Distributor and north of the Airport Starting with Redfern and ending in Mascot are sometimes included in this region, even though these suburbs are neither east nor south-east of Sydney CBD. The region corresponds with the Parish of Alexandria and the Parish of Botany, two cadastral parishes used for land title purposes.

For statistical purposes, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) limits its definition of the &quot;Eastern Suburbs&quot; statistical area (Statistical Area level 4) to comprising just the Woollahra, Waverley and Randwick local government areas. As at the , this ABS region had an estimated population of , up from 249,546 in the . The &quot;Eastern Suburbs&quot; statistical area is further divided into:
* &quot;Eastern Suburbs - North&quot; Statistical Area Level 3, which includes Woollahra Council, Waverley Council and The Centennial Parklands with postcodes 2021 to 2030.
* &quot;Eastern Suburbs - South&quot; Statistical Area Level 3, which includes most of City of Randwick with postcodes 2031 to 2036.
Outside the &quot;Eastern Suburbs&quot; statistical area, the ABS defines the &quot;Botany&quot; Statistical Area Level 3, which includes the part of Bayside Council that used to be City of Botany Bay along with Port Botany which is part of City of Randwick. The &quot;Botany&quot; statistical area is part of the &quot;Sydney - City and Inner South&quot; Statistical Area Level 4.

From south to north, these are the Electoral Districts of Maroubra, Heffron, Coogee, Vaucluse and (partly) Sydney. The political allegiances of these electorates reflect the socio-demographic difference between the different parts of the Eastern Suburbs. Vaucluse, covering the northern Eastern Suburbs, is a safe electorate for the Liberal Party of Australia and has elected a member from the Liberal Party or one of its predecessor conservative parties since it was established in its current form in 1927. The electorates of Maroubra and Heffron in the south are safe electorates for the Australian Labor Party and have elected members from the Labor Party since each of them was established. The electorate of Coogee is historically a marginal electorate but has been held by the Labor Party since 2019. Sydney, being an inner-city electorate, has elected independent members since it was re-established in its current form in 2007.

At the federal government level, the Eastern Suburbs are represented by the Division of Wentworth (north) and the Division of Kingsford Smith (south). Wentworth is a safe conservative seat and is currently held by a Teal independent member. The Division of Kingsford Smith is a safe Labor seat and has been held by the Labor Party since the establishment of the electorate in 1949.

<text>West Footscray railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of West Footscray, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. West Footscray station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform, accessible by a pedestrian footbridge. It opened on 1 October 1888, with the current island platform provided in 2013 and the current side platform provided in 2020.

Initially opened as Footscray West, the station was given its current name of West Footscray on 1 September 1912.

Two dual gauge tracks run to the north of the station, forming the South Kensington – West Footscray freight line, which links the Port of Melbourne and other freight terminals to the rest of the state. The tracks also form part of the Melbourne – Sydney and Melbourne – Adelaide standard gauge lines. Two Regional Rail Link tracks run to the south of the station.

==History==
In 1976, the original station buildings were demolished, and replaced with brick structures. In 2013, the station was rebuilt 200 metres further west, to accommodate two lines to the south as part of the Regional Rail Link project. On 14 October of that year, the new station opened, and the old station was demolished soon after.

A third platform has been built to the north of the existing island platform, as part of the Metro Tunnel project, to allow services to terminate and return. Work commenced in late 2018 and the new platform was opened on 6 July 2020.

==Platforms, facilities and services==
West Footscray has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. It is served by Sunbury line trains, but express services do not stop there. Access to the platforms is provided by stairs, lifts and ramps from an overhead footbridge, which also includes a cycling path. 

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2 (currently closed):
* Was Platform 1 until the new side platform opened in July 2020. Will become a turnback platform after the opening of the Metro Tunnel in 2025.

Platform 3 (formerly Platform 2):
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

In 2025, it is planned that services on the Sunbury line will be through-routed to the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

==Transport links==
CDC Melbourne operates three bus routes via West Footscray station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Laverton station – Footscray
* : Laverton station – Footscray
* : Laverton station – Footscray station

Transit Systems Victoria operates two routes via West Footscray station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<text>PR Newswire is a distributor of press releases headquartered in Chicago. The service was created in 1954 to allow companies to electronically send press releases to news organizations, using teleprinters at first. The founder, Herbert Muschel, operated the service from his house in Manhattan for approximately 15 years. The business was eventually sold to Western Union and then United Newspapers of London. In December 2015, Cision Inc. announced it would acquire the company. On January 1, 2021, Cision formally merged PR Newswire into the company.

==History==
PR Newswire was founded in March 1954 by Herbert Muschel, who ran the business from his town house in New York City for the first 15 years of its operation. The company used telecommunications lines and teleprinters owned by Western Union to distribute content to a dozen news organizations in New York. Its first customer was Trans World Airlines.

In 1963, Muschel recruited David Steinberg of the New York Herald Tribune to take a management position with the company after the 1962–1963 New York City newspaper strike. Muschel had been impressed by Steinberg&#x27;s use of the service to report financial news during the strike without using reporters.

Muschel sold 81% of the company to Western Union in 1970 for over 60 thousand shares of letter stock, with Muschel and Steinberg continuing to manage the company after the acquisition. Steinberg served as vice president and chief of operations, and became president of the company in 1976.

In 1977, PR Newswire began using electronic terminals for copy editing.

By 1978, PR Newswire distributed content to approximately 250 news points and financial institutions in 75 cities using 12,000 miles of private transmission lines. In addition to its New York headquarters, the service also sent content from offices in Boston, Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco at a rate of 150 words per minute.

In 1982, the company was sold to United Newspapers of London for $9.5 million. PR Newswire acquired Mediawire in 1983, expanding the company&#x27;s reach into over 125 newsrooms in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and West Virginia. The company acquired Intermedia Group in 1985, incorporating its regional news wires in Washington, D.C., Michigan, Ohio, and Georgia.

ABC-TV and Indesys partnered with PR Newswire in 1989 to provide news feeds to television and entertainment editors and writers in the U.S. and Canada. Program changes, production schedules, and news from entertainment sources were transmitted over a satellite distribution network and an FM subcarrier.

Steinberg retired in 1992, but continued as vice chairman until 2002. During his tenure, the service became a state-of-the-art communications network with 700 employees.

In 2000 the company acquired eWatch, founded in 1995 as an automated service to monitor websites, chat rooms, Usenet groups, web publications, online service forums and investor message boards for mentions of a specific organization, issue, product or service. In 2001, PR Newswire issued a multimedia news release for Touchstone Pictures promoting the film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, which included b-roll, soundbites, high resolution images, and film trailer. On April 17, 2007, PR Newswire acquired Vintage Filings.

In December 2008, PR Newswire moved its New York City corporate headquarters from Midtown Manhattan to Lower Manhattan, at 350 Hudson Street. In mid-2009, PR Newswire acquired The Fuel Team. The largest competitor to PR Newswire is Business Wire, . On December 15, 2015, PR Newswire was sold to global media intelligence company, Cision, for $841 million. The transaction, which required approval by the shareholders of UBM plc as well as regulatory approvals, was expected to close late in the first quarter of 2016. (closing date of the deal) it became a subsidiary of Cision. 

In the 2010s, PR Newswire and its competitor Business Wire were the target of extensive successful attacks by Ukrainian hackers, who accessed not yet published press releases to enable insider trading. According to the FBI, the case was then the world&#x27;s largest known computer hacking and securities fraud, with profits exceeding $100 million in trades that were made public by the SEC, but believed to be vastly higher than that by the authorities. Fewer than half of over 100 suspects involved had been arrested as of 2018.

==ProfNet==
ProfNet is an online community of communications professionals made to provide reporters access to expert sources and a subsidiary of PR Newswire. ProfNet was founded in 1992 by Dan Forbush, then an administrator at SUNY Stony Brook. The original pilot program operated on CompuServe. After the university changed administrations in 1994, Forbush was unable to convince them to continue running the service. Forbush privatized ProfNet in 1995 and sold it to PR Newswire in March 1996. As a commercial service, ProfNet began charging institutions to participate. By the end of the following year, the distribution list included 2,800 contacts, mostly affiliated with colleges and universities. Other contacts worked at industrial laboratories like Bell Labs and societies like the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Many contacts were spokespeople for their institutions, rather than subject-matter experts themselves.

<text>Tottenham railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of West Footscray, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Tottenham station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 2 March 1891, with the current station provided in 1982.

The station is located on the Ashley Street rail overpass, which provides station access. Tottenham Yard runs north of the station. A number of freight-only lines also operate alongside, as well as the Melbourne – Sydney and Melbourne – Adelaide standard gauge lines. The Regional Rail Link lines run on the south side of the station.

==History==
Tottenham station, as with the adjacent suburb, was named after Tottenham in Middlesex, England.

During 1981–1982, the existing ground-level station was rebuilt as part of the scheme to eliminate the Ashley Street level crossing. The new station was an island platform on a rail overpass, which extended the existing two-lane road tunnel. The new up line opened on 19 May 1981, and the down line and island platform opened on 27 July 1982. At the same time, the signal box was demolished, and a number of signal posts and a crossover were abolished.

In 2014, the station underwent minor upgrades as part of the Regional Rail Link (RRL) project. The biggest of those was the further extension of the bridge over Ashley Street, to accommodate the new RRL tracks. The façade facing Sunshine Road was also upgraded, and a new car park and &quot;park and ride&quot; facilities were added. A power substation was also built on Sunshine Road, just beyond the car park.

White City station used to be located between Tottenham and Sunshine. On 4 October 1981, White City was closed to all traffic and demolished.

==Platforms and services==
Tottenham has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Sunbury line trains. Express services do not stop at Tottenham.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

In 2025, it is planned that services on the Sunbury line will be through-routed to the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Sunshine railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the Sunbury, Geelong and Ballarat lines, serving the western suburb of the same name in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Sunshine is a ground level, premium station. It has four platforms, an island platform with two faces and two side platforms, connected by a footbridge and concourse. The station opened on 7 September 1885, with the current station provided in 2014 when it was rebuilt as part of the Regional Rail Link project.

Originally named Braybrook Junction, it was given its current name in July 1907 when the suburb of Sunshine took its name from the Sunshine Harvester Works.

V/Line services on the Bendigo corridor pass through the station but do not stop at it. Freight services running towards northern Victoria and Sydney run past the station, as well as freight trains heading for the western standard gauge line via the Newport–Sunshine railway line. The bus interchange at the station is a hub for routes to surrounding suburbs.

The station is planned to receive a significant package of upgrades as part of the Melbourne Airport Rail project, with works planned to commence in early 2026.

==History==
===19th century===
The Melbourne &amp; Murray River Railway was built in the late 1850s, from Footscray to Bendigo. No station was built at that time on the current site; the closest station was Albion and Darlington, on the site of the current Albion station.

In 1874, a line to Melton was built, branching from the Bendigo line; a station was built at the site of the junction, opening on September 7, 1885, as Braybrook Junction. This line would be extended westwards to Bacchus Marsh in 1887 and eventually meet with another line extended eastwards from Ballarat in 1889. This line became the direct route from Melbourne to Ballarat; the original line ran via Geelong.

In 1887, the Newport-Sunshine railway line was opened, connecting the new station at Braybrook Junction to Newport and Williamstown, Victoria&#x27;s major cargo port at the time.

===20th century===
In 1907, Braybrook Junction station was renamed Sunshine, after Hugh McKay had moved his Sunshine Harvester Works to a site adjacent to the station.

On 20 April 1908, Sunshine was the scene of the Sunshine train disaster, the worst train crash in Victorian railway history. 44 people were killed and over 400 were injured.

In 1929, the Albion – Jacana goods line was opened, connecting Sunshine with the North East line, allowing freight trains to avoid the steeper grades and suburban traffic on the suburban line between North Melbourne, Essendon and Broadmeadows.

The road level crossing at Sunshine was removed when grade separation was carried out in 1961. The works took place as part of the project to construct a standard gauge line from Sydney to Melbourne. In that same year, boom barriers were provided at the nearby former Anderson Road level crossing, on the Bendigo line.

In January 1963, a fourth platform was provided on the adjacent Melbourne – Sydney standard gauge line, to enable passengers to transfer between the interstate Sydney and Adelaide expresses. In 1965, control of signals at Albion was transferred to the signal box at Sunshine. Also in that year, the Grain Elevator Board sidings, that serve the nearby grail silos, opened for traffic. In 1976, a signal panel was provided to replace an existing panel and, in 1977, boom barriers were provided at the nearby former Anderson Road level crossing, on the Serviceton line.

White City station was located between Sunshine and Tottenham. It closed on 4 October 1981 and has been removed.

On 5 February 1985, Harris trailer carriage 830T was destroyed by fire in a vandalism attack, whilst stabled in the former down end siding.

In 1988, the sidings leading to the Massey Ferguson factory were booked out of use. The lead to the sidings, which crossed the standard gauge line, was removed in February of that year.

In 1994, the former station underpass, which connected the platforms to nearby City Place, was completed, replacing an underpass. It was removed during the station upgrades between 2012 and 2014. Also in that year, the track leading to the former goods shed was removed, and a number of semaphore signals were replaced with automatic colour signals.

On 26 July 1996, Sunshine was upgraded to a premium station.

===21st century===
In mid-2004, the platform on the standard gauge line was removed. The waiting room on the platform was demolished five years earlier, in 1999.

From 2012 to 2014, the station was rebuilt as part of the Regional Rail Link project. Works included:
* a new bus interchange, completed in September 2013;
* construction of a new footbridge and concourse, completed in January 2014;
* upgrading Platforms 1 and 2 with new canopies;
* rebuilding Platform 3 and a new Platform 4, both completed in April 2014;

The standalone signal box to the north of the station, commissioned in 1914, was closed in 2016, and control of trains in the Sunshine and Albion areas was transferred to Metrol. The former signal box is one of the largest surviving examples of a tappet and lever frame box on the Victorian network, having once housed 80 levers. Although mechanical signalling was replaced with electronic interlocking before the box was finally taken out of service, it remains relatively intact as an example of Victorian Railways signal box architecture.

In early 2020, construction commenced on a new signal control centre south of the station, which will share control of the Sunshine–Dandenong corridor with an existing facility at Dandenong, after completion of the Metro Tunnel.

The station is planned to be rebuilt as part of the Melbourne Airport rail link project, with planned upgrades including new platforms and an improved track layout to &quot;untangle [the] complex junction&quot; and enable increased capacity for trains to the airport and western suburbs.

==Expansion and precinct masterplan==

In 2018, the Victorian Government announced that the Melbourne Airport Rail project would operate via Sunshine. The state government committed to upgrade the station into a &quot;superhub&quot; for passengers transferring between V/Line services, metropolitan services and airport trains.

Immediate works at Sunshine, funded as part of the airport link, included the construction of a second accessible concourse for interchanging, extra ticket gates, new lifts, a new regional platform and extensions of existing regional platforms to enable 9-carriage VLocity trains to stop at the station.

In 2022, early construction commenced on the Melbourne Airport Rail project, and a masterplan for the Sunshine station precinct was released. The plan includes new entrances to the station, an integrated bus interchange, open spaces, high-density developments surrounding the station, and the creation of pedestrian and cycling links across the rail lines. Trains on the Bendigo line, which currently skip Sunshine, are planned to begin stopping at the station to enable Bendigo line passengers to change to Airport trains.

Works at Sunshine are planned to commence in early 2026 following $2 billion of funding announced by the Commonwealth Government.

== Facilities, platforms and services ==
Sunshine has two side platforms and a centre island platform with two faces. Access is provided to the platforms using stairs, lifts and ramps from an overhead footbridge and concourse, which features a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room and toilets.

It is served by Sunbury line and V/Line Ballarat and Geelong line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

By June 2025, it is planned that trains on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

Platform 3:
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (set down only)
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (set down only)
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (set down only)
* one daily V/Line service to Southern Cross (set down only)

Platform 4:

<text>Albion railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Albion, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Albion station is a ground level host station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 5 January 1860, with the current station provided in 1919. The station was originally closed on 1 January 1861, then reopened on 24 March 1891.

Initially opened as Albion and Darlington, the station was given its current name of Albion on 24 March 1891, upon its reopening.

The Melbourne – Sydney standard gauge line passes to the east of the station and, along with the Albion – Jacana freight line, branches off north of the station.

==History==
The Melbourne &amp; Murray River Railway (now the Bendigo line) opened in 1859, operating from Footscray to Sunbury. By the early 1860s, the line had been extended to Bendigo. A station named Albion and Darlington was built on the site of the current station, opening on 5 January 1860. Albion and Darlington only remained open for a single year. In 1891, a new station, named Albion, opened to the west of the previous station. In 1919, Albion was relocated to its current site.

In 1961, the former Ballarat Road level crossing was grade separated, and was replaced with a road overpass, just north of the station.

Until 1961, the station had a signal box to control of the junction with the Albion – Jacana freight line, after which it was replaced by a signal panel, which was moved to the Sunshine signal box in 1965. In 1972, both platforms were extended. In 2022, both platforms were again extended at the up end.

As part of the Melbourne Airport rail link project, Albion is scheduled to be rebuilt. An 18-metre high flyover will be built above the station and Ballarat Road.

==Platforms and services==
Albion has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Sunbury line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

In 2025, it is planned that services on the Sunbury line will be through-routed to the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

==Transport links==
Kinetic Melbourne operates two bus routes via Albion station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Caroline Springs – Highpoint Shopping Centre
* : Caroline Springs – Sunshine station

Transit Systems Victoria operates one bus route via Albion station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Sunshine station – Woodgrove Shopping Centre (Melton)

<doc id="708031" wikidata="Q5563127" url="?curid=708031" title="Ginifer railway station">
<text>Ginifer railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of St Albans, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ginifer station is a below ground unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 31 October 1982, with the current station provided in 2016.

==History==
Ginifer station opened on 31 October 1982. It was first announced in June 1977 by the then Transport Minister Joe Rafferty, and was scheduled for completion by late 1978. Originally to be named Furlong, after the nearby arterial road, upon opening it was named Ginifer, in honour of Jack Ginifer, a former local member of State Parliament.

In 1984, boom barriers were provided at the former Furlong Road level crossing, which was located nearby in the up direction of the station. In 1994, the station was provided with CCTV.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Ginifer to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

Until the extension of the Sydenham Line to Sunbury in 2012, Ginifer was served by two V/Line services a day to and from Sunbury.

In June 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced that the Furlong Road level crossing would be removed by grade separation, with Ginifer to be rebuilt below ground. During October–November 2016, the level crossing was removed and, on 1 November of that year, the rebuilt station opened.

== Platforms and services ==
Ginifer has two side platforms. It is served by Sunbury line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

Prior to electrification of the line to Sydenham in 2002, selected V/Line services stopped at Ginifer, to pick up/drop off students from the Sydenham Catholic Regional College.

In 2025, it is planned that services on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>St Albans railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of St Albans, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. St Albans station is a below ground premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 February 1887, with the current station provided in 2016.

==History==
St Albans station opened on 1 February 1887. It was provided at the request of a land development company that was sub-dividing the area. The company manager, Alfred Padley, asked for the station be named St Albans, apparently due to his forebears having an association with the English city of the same name.

Originally, only three trains each way passed through St Albans on weekdays, and passengers had to inform the train guard at the prior stop if they wanted to alight there. In 1888, a local service was provided, although it could not start operating to St Albans until 19 November of that year, when a single crossover was added, with tail-ropes probably used to shunt carriages with a locomotive on the adjacent track.

In 1898, that situation was resolved, when a second crossover was added and, by 1899, three non-interlocked signals had been provided in each direction, with the first proper signal box brought into use on 17 June 1901. Later, steam-era trains operated hourly from Flinders Street to Braybrook Junction, with eight of hose trains continuing to St Albans.

In October 1921, the station became the terminus of the electrified network from the city, and services were improved, with trains operating every 40 minutes by day and hourly at night.

The original station was located at the down end of the former Main Road level crossing, with all terminating electric trains using Platform 2. In 1959, the station was rebuilt, with an island platform built on the up side of the level crossing. One side faced the main line and the other side formed a dock platform for terminating suburban trains. The old westbound platform was removed, but the eastbound platform remained for Spencer Street-bound regional trains. Train stabling sidings were also provided around that time. In 1986, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Main Road level crossing.

A signal box with a mechanical lever frame, now abolished, was located on the former island platform, to control access to the former back platform and sidings.

On 26 July 1996, St Albans was upgraded to a premium station.

In January 2002, as part of the extension of the electrified network to Sydenham, the platform that had been located at the down end of the level crossing was replaced by a new platform at the up end of the crossing.

In November 2012, after electrification of the line was extended to Sunbury, V/Line Bendigo services ceased stopping at St Albans, and Metro Trains&#x27; terminating services also ceased, with Platform 3 no longer regularly used. The stabling yard was still used for train storage, until work on the grade separation project began in 2015.

In late 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority commenced a grade separation project that replaced the Main Road level crossing with a road bridge over a lowered rail line. On 1 November 2016, the rebuilt station opened, with the overall project completed by mid-2017. Roughly a third of the station was directly below Main Road, with the remainder also lowered.

==Platforms and services==
St Albans has two side platforms, located below ground level. It is served by Sunbury line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Watergardens and Sunbury

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Watergardens railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Sydenham, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Watergardens station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 March 1859, with the current station location provided in 2002 and the platforms extension in 2022.

Initially opened as Keilor Road, this station was renamed to Sydenham on 1 April 1887, then was given its current name of Watergardens on 26 January 2002.

A stabling yard is located at the down (Sunbury) end of the station.

== History ==
=== Sydenham ===
Sydenham station originally opened on 1 March 1859, shortly after the railway line was extended from Sunshine to Sunbury.

In 1926, interlocked gates were provided at the former Melton Highway level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. In 1987, they were replaced with boom barriers. In 1989, a rail siding at the station was abolished, as well as a number of signal posts.
=== Watergardens ===
In 2002, as part of the extension of the electrified network from St Albans, Sydenham was closed, and a new station was built approximately in the up direction. Opening on 26 January of that year, the new station was named Watergardens, after the adjacent Watergardens Shopping Centre. The new station was to be called Sydenham, with the name being built into the brickwork of the station building. However, naming rights were sold to the shopping centre. The name &quot;Sydenham&quot; can still be seen on the side of the building adjacent to Platform 3. Around 2012, the Sydenham name was dropped, with the station now generally referred to as Watergardens.

In late 2002, the Melton Highway level crossing was upgraded, in conjunction with the duplication of the highway. In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced the grade separation of the highway and railway line. In January 2018, the Melton Highway level crossing (down line) was removed and replaced with a bridge for Melton Highway, with the project completed in October.

In 2022, all three platforms were extended from to long.

== Platforms and services ==

Watergardens has one side platform and one island platform with two faces. It is served by Sunbury line trains, as well as a limited number of V/Line services on the Bendigo and Swan Hill lines.

Platform 1:
* terminating services; all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* three weekday morning V/Line services to Southern Cross (set down only)
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (set down only)

Platform 2:
* terminating services; all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street 

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Sunbury
* one weekday evening V/Line service to Bendigo (pick up only)
* V/Line services to Swan Hill (pick up only)

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Dhirajlal Hirachand &quot;Dhirubhai&quot; Ambani (28 December 1932 – 6 July 2002) was an Indian billionaire businessman who founded Reliance Industries in 1958. Ambani took Reliance public in 1977. In 2016, he was honoured posthumously with the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second-highest civilian honour for his contributions to trade and industry. Ambani faced numerous accusations of market manipulation, tax evasion, and cronyism.

==Early career==

Dhirubhai Ambani was one of the sons of Hirachand Gordhanbhai Ambani, a village school teacher belonging to the Modh vaniya (Baniya) community and Jamnaben Ambani and was born in Chorwad, Malia Taluka, Junagadh district, Gujarat on 28 December 1932. He did his studies from Bahadur Khanji school. He returned from Aden in 1958 to try his hand at his own business in India in the textile market. It is also said that he has worked at a gas station as a petrol vendor. 

==Founding of Reliance Industries==
Ambani returned to India and started &quot;Majin&quot; in partnership with Champaklal Damani, his second cousin, who lived with him in Yemen. Majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices to Yemen.

The first office of the Reliance Commercial Corporation was set up at the Narsinatha Street in Masjid Bunder. It was a room with a telephone, one table and three chairs. Initially, they had two assistants to help them with their business.

During this period, Ambani and his family stayed in a two-bedroom apartment at the Jai Hind Estate in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai. In 1965, Champaklal Damani and Dhirubhai Ambani ended their partnership and Ambani started on his own. It is believed that both had different temperaments and different takes on how to conduct business. 

==Controversies== 
===Allegation of market manipulation=== 
In 1988, Reliance Industries came up against a rights issue regarding partly convertible debentures. It was rumoured that the company was making all efforts to ensure that their stock prices did not slide an inch. Sensing an opportunity, The Bear Cartel, a group of stock brokers from Calcutta, started to short sell the shares of Reliance. To counter this, a group of stock brokers until recently referred to as &quot;Friends of Reliance&quot; started to buy the short-sold shares of Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

To find a solution to this situation, the Bombay Stock Exchange was closed for three business days. Authorities from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) intervened in the matter and brought down the &quot;Unbadla&quot; rate to 2 with a stipulation that the Bear Cartel had to deliver the shares within the next few days. The Bear Cartel bought shares of Reliance from the market at higher price levels and it was also learnt that Dhirubhai Ambani himself supplied those shares to the Bear Cartel and earned a healthy profit out of The Bear Cartel&#x27;s adventure.

After this incident, many questions were raised by his detractors and the press. Not many people were able to understand how a yarn trader until a few years ago was able to get in such a huge amount of cash flow during a crisis period. The answer to this was provided by the then finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee in the Parliament. He informed the house that a Non-Resident Indian had invested up to 220 million in Reliance during 1982–83. These investments were routed through many companies like Crocodile, Lota and Fiasco. These companies were primarily registered in Isle of Man. All the promoters or owners of these companies had a common surname Shah. An investigation by the Reserve Bank of India in the incident did not find any unethical or illegal acts or transactions committed by Reliance or its promoters.

==Death==
Ambani was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai on 24 June 2002 after he suffered a major stroke. It was his second stroke, the first had occurred in February 1986 and had paralyzed his right hand. He was in a coma for more than a week and a number of doctors were consulted. He died on 6 July 2002 at the age of 69.

==Post death==
Following his first stroke in 1986, Ambani handed over control of Reliance to his sons, Mukesh and Anil. In November 2004, Mukesh in an interview admitted to having differences with Anil over ownership issues. He also said that the differences &quot;are in the private domain&quot;.
After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani, the group was split into Reliance Industries Limited headed by Mukesh, and Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group headed by Anil. So finally Mukesh Ambani was elected as the CEO and Anil Ambani was elected as the chairperson.

As of 2017, the company had more than 250,000 employees. In 2012, Reliance Industries was one of the two Indian companies to be ranked among the top 100 in the Fortune 500 list of the world&#x27;s largest companies by revenue.

==In popular media==
In 1988 an unauthorized biography of Dhirubhai Ambani, by Hamish McDonald with the title &quot;The Polyester Prince&quot;, outlined all his political and business conquests. The book was not published in India because the Ambanis threatened legal action; an updated version went on sale under the title &quot;Ambani and Sons&quot; in 2010, and there has been no action against the publisher so far.

A Bollywood movie &quot;Guru&quot;, directed by filmmaker Mani Ratnam, is said to be set on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani due to similarities between the plot and Ambani&#x27;s life. However, Ratnam has denied that is a biography but has said it draws the &quot;essence of the character&quot; from real life.

==Accolades==

* 15 June 1998 – Dean&#x27;s Medal by The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, for setting an outstanding example of leadership. Dhirubhai Ambani was the first Indian to receive the Dean&#x27;s Medal.
* January 2016 – posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the country&#x27;s second-highest civilian award.

<text>Kensington railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Kensington in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Kensington station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 November 1860, with the current station provided in 1871. It initially closed on 1 July 1864, then reopened on 9 October 1871.

Special services to Flemington Racecourse and Showgrounds pass through the station, but do not stop, with signs on Platform 2 advising passengers of this.

== Description ==
The most obvious difference between the two station buildings is the cantilever verandah with its scalloped ripple-iron valance and the elegant post-supported one opposite. Similar to the Moonee Ponds and Ascot Vale stations, the station has a hipped roof profile, convex verandah with trellis end filling and numerous eaves brackets completing the Italian influence here and in most other station buildings in the State. Coloured brickwork and the pointed arch at openings lend a medieval time scale. Elevated siting has provided scope for an extensive wall and a piered iron fence to face the plantation reserve below; this appears to be from the 1905 improvements to the complex. The down side station is simply a deep masonry wall, with stone quoining, similar fenestration and domed pylons at each end, injecting the contemporary Edwardian Free-Style element into what was otherwise a matching design to the 1889 station. Basalt rubble garden borders, pepper trees, pitosporum and acanthus are plantings probably synonymous with the 1905 improvements. Similar landscaped track margins occur to the south. The up platform is likely to be the original 1860 basalt coping and walls, whilst the down side probably dates from the 1880s. The signal box has an unusual design and is built in the manner of the nearby station buildings, with polychrome brickwork and a hipped roof form. Three sides of glazing at the upper level are accessed by a cantilevered wrought-iron walkway cum terrace, linked with ground by a timber stair. Detail includes a scalloped eaves valance and saltire-cross panels above the windows. Nearby, a pepper tree adds period to the site. The upside, downside and signal box buildings all form a group and collectively complement the Victorian era buildings in the Bellair Street shopping precinct.

==History==

Kensington station opened on 1 November 1860, just over a week after the railway line to Essendon opened as part of the private Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company. The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, due to failure to make a profit. The needs of the Newmarket Saleyards and Racecourse, and the increasing difficulties in driving cattle mustered in the north and west of the Colony overland from North Melbourne station, inspired the line&#x27;s purchase by the Government and its reopening on 9 October 1871. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Kensington, in central London.

Increasing population in the Flemington-Kensington area resulted in new station facilities being built on the up (Melbourne-bound) side in 1888. Campbell and Gray were the contractors for the station, while A. Challingsworth built the down (west) side in 1905, together with improvements at Moonee Ponds and Essendon 1908. This also was the first line to run electric trains in Australia. Presumably as a mark of the increasing traffic on the now duplicated line, contractor A. T. Taylor built the signal box in 1887 during the reign of R. Watson as Engineer in Chief of the railways. In 1965, the interlocked gates at the Macaulay Road level crossing were replaced with boom barriers. The signal box is located at the up end of the station, just past the level crossing. A siding is also located at the up end, used for the nearby grain silos.

On 5 November 1986, a collision between a Broadmeadows-bound Comeng train and locomotive H4 occurred near the station. Also in that year, a number of goods lines to the south of the station were booked out of use. The overhead wires for these lines were also removed around this time.

== Platforms and services ==
Kensington has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Craigieburn line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Craigieburn

<text>Sverre Petterssen (19 February 1898 – 31 December 1974) was a Norwegian meteorologist, prominent in the field of weather analysis and forecasting.

==Early life==
Born in Norway into a humble family, he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office, and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit. He studied in Bergen where he met Tor Bergeron during a lecture, and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the Bergen School of Meteorology in 1923. In the late 1920s, he worked at the Geophysical Institute in Tromsø in northern Norway.

==Career==
After school, he remained a weather officer in the Norwegian Air Force until 1939. He went to the US in 1935, lecturing on Norwegian meteorological theories to the US Navy and Caltech. In 1939, he was hired by MIT as head of the meteorology department and wrote two important books there: &quot;Weather analysis and forecasting&quot; (1940) and &quot;Introduction to Meteorology&quot; (1941).

With the invasion of Norway, Petterssen returned to Europe and offered his services in England to the Met Office, on loan from the Norwegian Air Force. During World War II, he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations.

Pettersen is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history, the D-Day forecast, where he contributed significantly to the postponement of D-day by one day from 5 to 6 June; . Three groups of meteorologists gave advice to General Eisenhower; see Weather forecasting for Operation Overlord.

Pettersen disagreed with the American USAAF team of Irving P. Krick and Ben Holtzman (as did Stagg and the British naval team). Krick and Holtzman believed that weather patterns were repeated, and that there was a weather recurring pattern in the 20s which they felt was positive. Pettersen was not always diplomatic in saying that this was nonsense and quasi-science.

Eisenhower had originally picked 5 June for the invasion; with the option of postponing to 6 or 7 June. At the morning meeting on 4 June Pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 June. So D-Day was postponed, to strong protests from the American &quot;quasi-meteorologists&quot;.

But the Norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology: His analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms on the morning of 6 June – just enough to make the giant attack with more than a hundred thousand soldiers, paratroopers, planes and boats.&quot;The forecast provided by Sverre Petterssen caused Eisenhower to decide at 04.30 on 4 June to postpone D-day to 6 June.

And German ships were held in port: the Kriegsmarine thought the weather was too bad for the invasion.

The next possible period after 5, 6 and 7 June was 19 June. But on 19 June the worst storm to date in the century struck the English Channel. If D-Day had been launched on 5 June as originally planned, the Allied casualties would probably have been much higher, and even higher if launched on 19 June. International Commission for the History of Meteorology The Weather Network Proceedings of the International Commission on History of Meteorology 1.1 (2004)

==Aftermath==
In retrospect, Americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologist heroes who saved the situation, and only in 1974, shortly before his death, Sverre Pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel.

The American Meteorological historian James Fleming also honored Pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004.

<text>The Battle of Saint-Quentin of 1557 was a decisive engagement of the Italian War of 1551–1559 between the Kingdom of France and the Spanish Empire, at Saint-Quentin in Picardy. A Habsburg Spanish force under Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy defeated a French army under the command of Louis de Gonzague, and Anne de Montmorency, Duke of Montmorency.

== Battle ==
The battle took place on the Feast Day of St. Lawrence 10 August. Philibert, with his English allies, had placed St. Quentin under siege. Montmorency with a force of around 26,000 men marched to St. Quentin to relieve the city. Facing a force twice their size, Montmorency attempted to gain access to St. Quentin through a marsh, but a delayed French withdrawal allowed the Spanish to defeat the French and capture Montmorency.

During the battle the Saint-Quentin collegiate church was badly damaged by fire.
==Aftermath==
After the victory over the French at St. Quentin, &quot;the sight of the battlefield gave Philip a permanent distaste for war&quot;; he declined to pursue his advantage, withdrawing to the Spanish Netherlands to the north, where he had been the Governor since 1555. In 1558, the Habsburgs won again at the Battle of Gravelines. The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis ended the war in 1559.

==Notable participants==
The Frenchman Martin Guerre fought in the Spanish ranks and his leg was amputated.
During his long absence, another soldier famously impersonated him in Guerre&#x27;s village until he returned in 1560. Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s uncle was killed here in 1557.

== Feast of Saint Lawrence ==
Being extremely pious, Philip II was aware that 10 August is the Feast of St Lawrence, a Roman deacon who was roasted on a gridiron for his Christian beliefs. Hence, in commemoration of the great victory on St Lawrence’s Day, Philip sent orders to Spain that a great palace in the shape of a gridiron should be built in the Guadarrama Mountains northwest of Madrid. Known as El Escorial, it was finally completed in 1584.
== In culture==
 (&quot;It became the one of St. Quentin&quot;) is a Spanish proverbial phrase to describe a big dispute.

<text>Newmarket railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Flemington in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Newmarket station is an elevated host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 November 1860, with the current station provided in 1871. It initially closed on 1 July 1864, then reopened on 9 October 1871.

Special services to Flemington Racecourse and Showgrounds pass through the station, but do not stop, with signs on Platform 2 advising passengers of this. The junction for the Flemington Racecourse line is located immediately north of the station.

==History==

Newmarket station opened on 1 November 1860, just over a week after the railway line to Essendon opened as part of the private Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company. The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, but was reopened on 9 October 1871, under government ownership. The name of the station comes from the fact that land was granted in 1858 for the establishment of the Newmarket Saleyards and the Melbourne City Abattoir. Both the abattoir and saleyards opened in 1861, with livestock relocating from the &quot;old market&quot; on the corner of Elizabeth and Victoria Streets, near the Melbourne CBD.

In 1886, a permanent station building was built and, in 1925, the present buildings were provided. In 1880, interlocking and a signal box, for the Flemington Racecourse line junction, were brought into use and, in 1969, became remotely controlled from Kensington.

During April and May 1994, the timber decking across Racecourse Road was replaced, with the tracks laid on concrete, and new concrete abutments on both sides of the bridge being laid. The current bridge over Racecourse Road is the third bridge on site.

During construction of CityLink in 1997–1998, the station was used for passengers to shuttle to and from Flemington Bridge on the Upfield line, due to services not operating between Flemington Bridge and North Melbourne, and the temporary closure of Macaulay. This was to allow elevated roads, linking the West Gate and Tullamarine Freeways, to be constructed.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Newmarket to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

In 2014, it became obvious that structural problems were affecting the building on Platform 1, which is elevated and on concrete piers, on which cracks and concrete cancer were evident. The retaining wall at the back of the platform was also exhibiting extensive concrete cancer. Metal props were inserted to shore up the piers, and the cantilevered awning over the platform was demolished, and replaced by a temporary timber structure. Half of the large ramp from street level to the station entrance was removed, partly to allow three steel straps to be bolted to the outside of the building, to support the wall. Parts of the building were eventually demolished in that year.

== Platforms and services ==
Newmarket has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Craigieburn line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Craigieburn

==Transport links==

Yarra Trams operates one route via Newmarket station:

<doc id="708044" wikidata="Q7863870" url="?curid=708044" title="UBM plc">
<text>UBM plc was a British business-to-business (B2B) events organiser headquartered in London, England, before its acquisition by Informa in 2018. It had a long history as a multinational media company. Its main focus was on B2B events, but its principal operations included live media and business-to-business communications, marketing services and data provision, and it principally served the technology, healthcare, trade and transport, ingredients and fashion industries. UBM was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
==History==
===Newspaper interests===
The history of the companies that made up UBM stretches back almost two hundred years. Up until its acquisition UBM businesses published many titles that were launched in the 19th century, including &quot;Building&quot; magazine, launched in 1843 by Joseph Hansom, as well as &quot;Chemist &amp; Druggist&quot;.

The company was founded in 1918 as United Newspapers by David Lloyd George to acquire the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot;. In 1929, the company merged with Provincial Newspapers, an owner of regional papers in the north; the next year, it sold its national papers. The company continued for decades as a regional newspaper publisher, making acquisitions such as &quot;Yorkshire Post Newspapers&quot; in 1969.

It acquired PR Newswire in 1982. In 1985, it bought Express Newspapers and continued to publish the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for some 15 years. Also in 1985, it bought US trade magazine and book publisher Miller Freeman. It changed its name to United News &amp; Media in 1995, sold its regional papers in 1998, and bought CMP Media, a technology-focused trade media company, in 1999 for $920 million. In 2000, it sold the &quot;Daily Express&quot; to Richard Desmond, sold most of Miller Freeman to VNU and Reed Elsevier and adopted the name of United Business Media. United Business Media acquired the trade publisher Aprovia UK (owner of &quot;The Builder&quot;) in 2003 and the medical publishing company MediMedia in 2004.

===Television interests===
MAI was part of a consortium that bid for the ITV south and south east area, which formed Meridian Broadcasting in 1991. MAI began to expand following the successful launch of Meridian: in 1994 the company bought Anglia Television, the ITV franchise for the east of England, and the following year became a major shareholder in the consortium that won the franchise for Channel 5. In 1996, MAI merged with United Newspapers (via an agreed takeover by United) to form United News &amp; Media (UNM). The resulting company owned the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, Meridian, Anglia, and a large shareholding (through the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;) in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, the owners of Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television. The stake in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television was sold to Granada, allowing them to take control of the two franchises in 1997. In November 1997 UBM also launched the now defunct satellite TV Channel Rapture TV which focussed on dance music and extreme sports. The channel was put up for sale in 2001, and was eventually brought by Edinburgh-based company Power TV a year later, in April 2002.

United News and Media later agreed to buy Scottish Television&#x27;s 20% stake in HTV and on 28 June 1997, HTV was taken over fully by UNM for £370 million.

In 1999, plans emerged of a merger between UNM and rival Carlton, however these talks failed when it appeared that Meridian would have to be sold off as a condition of the deal. As a result, the television assets of UNM were sold to Granada, however due to regulations stating that the company could not control that large an audience share, the broadcasting arm of HTV was sold to Carlton in exchange for Central&#x27;s 20% stake in Meridian.

===Reorganisation since 2005===
In 2005 UBM re-focused on two principal businesses: PR Newswire, a global news distribution business; and CMP, an international events, print and online publishing business. It disposed of NOP which was acquired by GfK for £383 million in 2005. In September 2006, NewBay Media acquired CMP Entertainment Media from United Business Media. The trade book operations of CMP were sold to Elsevier and Hal Leonard. It went on to acquire Commonwealth Business Media for $152 million in 2006. On 1 July 2008, as part of a reorganisation of the corporate structure of the Group, United Business Media Limited (UBML) was created as a new holding company and parent company of the Group. UBML is UK-listed and incorporated in Jersey. In 2010 the principal holding company of the United Business Media group (the &quot;Group&quot;) was organised into five operating segments: Events, TD &amp; M, Data Services, Online and Print.

In 2008, UBM moved its tax headquarters to Ireland, but in 2012, the company announced its intent to move its tax base back to the United Kingdom.

In September 2010, Canon Communications announced that it had agreed to be acquired by UBM. In May 2011, United Business Media officially changed its name to UBM plc. In February 2012 Yankee Group sold its annual 4G World telecoms and wireless trade show to UBM plc where it was incorporated into its UBM Tech division.

Briefing Media acquired UBM plc&#x27;s UK agriculture and medical general practitioner portfolios for £10 million in February 2012 while UBM plc announced the acquisition of four trade shows in Asia for 19.4 million in the same month, marking UBM plc&#x27;s continuing transformation into an events and B2B marketing services company. In 2012, PA Group, the parent company of the Press Association, sold its 50% stake in Canada Newswire to joint venture partner UBM for £30.1 million. In April 2013, UBM&#x27;s data services businesses were sold to Electra Partners.

In October 2014, UBM announced it would acquire Advanstar Communications for a fee of $972 million. In November 2014 UBM plc CEO, Tim Cobbold, announced a new Events First strategy By 2015, UBM had rebranded itself as primarily focused on B2B events. Reflecting this, 82 percent of its business in 2016 derived from events and only 18 percent from other marketing services. In December 2015, UBM announced the sale of PR Newswire to Cision for $841 million, subject to regulatory approval. UBM had owned the company since 1982. Some analysts interpreted this as a further step in the transition from a diverse media company to a B2B events company. In June 2016 UBM plc announced the completion of the sale of PR Newswire to Cision. In the same month UBM reached agreement to divest its electronics media portfolio to an affiliate of Arrow Electronics Inc. for a cash consideration of $23.5m. The portfolio comprised the US and Asian versions of EE Times, EDN, ESM, Embedded, EBN, TechOnline and Datasheets.com.

In January 2018 Informa announced the acquisition of the company for £4 billion. The transaction was completed in June 2018. In January 2019, Informa sold several of the UBM Life Sciences publications (including &quot;Spectroscopy&quot; and &quot;Psychiatric Times&quot;) to MJH Associates.

==Operations==
UBM was a global B2B events organizer. Its businesses included &quot;UBM Asia&quot;, &quot;UBM EMEA&quot; and &quot;UBM Americas&quot;. It was also a shareholder of ITN and Press Association. UBM&#x27;s brands included:

<text>Ascot Vale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Ascot Vale in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ascot Vale station is a ground-level host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 November 1860, with the current station provided in 1871. It initially closed on 1 July 1864, then reopened on 9 October 1871.

==History==

Ascot Vale station opened on 1 November 1860, just over a week after the railway line to Essendon opened as part of the private Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company. The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, but was reopened on 9 October 1871, under government ownership. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Ascot Racecourse in England, given its proximity to Flemington Racecourse.

In 1882, a temporary station building was provided, after duplication of the line, with the present building on Platform 1 dating from 1889. A signal box was provided in the same year, but was closed with the abolition of mechanical signalling in 1918.

== Platforms and services ==

Ascot Vale has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Craigieburn line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Craigieburn

==Transport links==

Transit Systems Victoria operates two bus routes via Ascot Vale station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Footscray station – Moonee Ponds Junction

<text>Moonee Ponds railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Moonee Ponds in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Moonee Ponds station is a ground level host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 November 1860, with the current station provided in 1882. It initially closed on 1 July 1864, then reopened in 9 October 1871.

==History==

Moonee Ponds station opened on 1 November 1860, just over a week after the railway line opened as part of the private Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company line to Essendon. The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, but was reopened on 9 October 1871, under government ownership. Like the suburb itself, the station is believed to have gotten its name from either the Moonee Ponds Creek, which resembled a chain of ponds in dry weather (the creek was noted as &quot;Mone Mone Creek&quot; in 1837 by government surveyor Robert Hoddle, during a survey of the area), an Indigenous Australian who was attached to the mounted police, or John Moonee, who had land near the present day Moonee Valley Racecourse.

In 1882, the station building on Platform 1 was provided, with a signal box provided in 1889 to control interlocked gates at the Puckle Street level crossing. In 1969, these gates were replaced with boom barriers.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Moonee Ponds to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

== Platforms and services ==
Moonee Ponds has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Craigieburn line services.

Platform 1:

<text>Essendon railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the suburban Craigieburn line and the regional Seymour line, part of the Melbourne and Victorian railway networks. It serves the northern suburb of Essendon in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Essendon station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 November 1860, with the current station provided in 1871. It initially closed on 1 July 1864, then reopened on 9 October 1871.

==History==
Essendon station opened on 1 November 1860 as the terminus of the private Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company line. The station closed with the line on 1 July 1864, but was reopened on 9 October 1871, under government ownership. The line to the north was opened in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Essendon in Hertfordshire, England.

In 1878, a completely new station, with a single platform, was provided, on the site of the present island platform, with passenger subways and footbridges added in 1886, along with conversion of the island platform to the current layout. It was also at that time that a rail overpass was provided at Mount Alexander Road, in what was one of the first grade separation projects to be carried out in the state. In 1909, the present buildings were provided, along with a centre track between Platforms 1 and 2.

In 1919, electric train services between the city and Essendon were inaugurated, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, and all-day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941.

In 1965, the double line block signalling between Broadmeadows and Essendon was abolished, and was replaced with three position signalling. In 1969, the station took the layout it has today, with the abolition of the centre track, the closure of the stand-alone signal box, the provision of automatic signalling along the line, and the replacement of the interlocked gates with boom barriers at the former Buckley Street level crossing. A signal panel was provided within the station office in that same year.

On 7 March 1974, Harris motor 518M and Tait motor 368M were destroyed by fire whilst stabled at the station. Tait trailer 85G was also damaged in the fire.

On 8 June 1987, stabling of suburban trains at Essendon ceased, with the overhead wiring of all sidings removed just over a year later. On 1 September 1988, the former sidings near Rose Street were removed.

On 16 August 1996, Essendon was upgraded to a premium station. Also in that year, siding &quot;B&quot; was taken out of service. On 7 June 2014, the signal panel was abolished.

On 20 September 2016, the Victorian State Government announced the grade separation of the Buckley Street level crossing. Construction began in 2018, with the level crossing removed and Buckley Street reopening on 28 September of that year. Buckley Street now passes under the railway line in a trench.

As part of the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel, it is expected that the turnback facilities at the station will be upgraded, to allow services to start at Essendon when the tunnel opens in 2025.

== Platforms and services ==
Essendon has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. Platform 1 is only used by V/Line services to overtake Metro Trains&#x27; services, or when three-car trains are terminating, as it is unable to accommodate a six-car train.

The station is served by Craigieburn line trains and some V/Line Seymour line services.

Platform 1:
* Passing loop only for V/Line services and three-car passenger services during major disruptions.

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

<text>Strathmore railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Essendon in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Strathmore station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 28 October 1890, with the current station provided in 1972.

Initially opened as North Essendon, the station was given its current name of Strathmore on 1 March 1955.

==History==
Strathmore station on 28 October 1890, with the railway line past the site of the station originally opening in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. The station, like the suburb itself, was named after a Presbyterian church which opened in 1936. The church was named by local settler Thomas Napier, who had a property named &quot;Rosebank&quot; in the area. The Strathmore name comes from a valley in Scotland, near where Napier was born.

Located at the point where the original Sydney Road (now Pascoe Vale Road) crossed the railway line via a level crossing, it was considered one of the worst traffic bottlenecks in Melbourne, until grade separation works were completed in 1964.

In 1965, a number of signals at the station were abolished, in conjunction with the replacement of double line block signalling with three position signalling between Broadmeadows and Essendon.

On 24 February 1972, the present station building on Platform 1 was provided.

Glenroy station opened on 24 January 1887, with the railway line past the site of the station opening in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after a pastoral run occupied by Duncan Cameron, who originated from Glen Roy, Scotland.

In 1908, a goods siding was provided and, in 1950, it was extended to a nearby flour mill. Hand gates protected the former Glenroy Road level crossing until 1957, when boom barriers were provided.

On 14 September 1973, Tait motor carriage 424M was destroyed by fire at the station. The original station buildings were provided in 1886 and, in 1976, were replaced with brick structures. In 1999, Glenroy was upgraded to a premium station, featuring the addition of customer service facilities and the conversion of the former ground-level station building into a waiting room.

The station was rebuilt for a second time by the Level Crossing Removal Project, due to the grade separation of the Glenroy Road level crossing. On 2 July 2019, it was announced that the level crossing would be removed by lowering the railway line underneath Glenroy Road, and would include a rebuilt station. On 11 October 2020, designs for the new station were released. Major construction began soon after and, on 6 May 2022, the rebuilt station opened.

== Platforms and services ==

<text>Jacana railway station is a commuter railway station on the Craigieburn line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Glenroy in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Jacana station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 15 February 1959.

The North East standard gauge line is located to the west of the station, crossing the broad gauge suburban lines via a flyover at the Craigieburn (down) end of the station. The Albion-Jacana freight line joins the main suburban line after the flyover, and the Western Ring Road passes under the station via a short tunnel.

== History ==

Jacana station opened on 15 February 1959, a number of years before the Housing Commission started construction of its nearby Jacana estate. The station, like the suburb itself, appears to get its name from a nearby street in neighbouring Broadmeadows.

The railway past the site of Jacana originally opened in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. In July 1958, construction of the station began, with the slewing of the down line occurring on 13 September of that year to make room for the island platform, as well as the flyover for the standard gauge line, which was under construction at the same time.

On 17 December 1972, the station was damaged by fire. Three days later, on 20 December, 10 wagons on a Sydney-bound freight train on the standard gauge line derailed immediately west of the station. The pedestrian overpass at the station was damaged during the derailment, but was repaired by 24 December. Much of the debris resulting from the derailment was also cleared by that date.

In 1975, the current overpass on Pascoe Vale Road, to the west of the station, was provided, replacing an earlier overpass.

On 14 November 1996, two Comeng train sets collided between Broadmeadows and Jacana, injuring 13 people. A city-bound train collided with a stationary Broadmeadows-bound train, and two carriages derailed.

== Platforms and services ==
Jacana has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Craigieburn line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

<text>Broadmeadows railway station is a commuter, regional and inter-city railway station on the suburban Craigieburn line, the regional Seymour and Albury lines, and the inter-city Southern line. It serves the northern suburb of Broadmeadows in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Broadmeadows is a ground level premium station featuring three side platforms. Platforms 1 and 2 are used for broad gauge Metro and V/Line services, while Platform 3 is used for standard gauge V/Line and NSW TrainLink services. The station opened on 1 February 1873, with the current station provided in 1990.

Train stabling facilities are located to the north of the station.

==History==
The railway past the site of Broadmeadows station originally opened in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. At the time of opening, the village of Broadmeadows was located some distance from the station, becoming known as &quot;Old Broadmeadows&quot;, and now Westmeadows. It was not until the post-World War II housing development that the gap between the old town and the station was filled.

The station was initially provided with a -long platform, a goods siding and shed, and a passing loop for trains on the single track. That early station was closer to Camp Road than the station today. In 1878, a permanent station building was provided, along with a longer platform, all on the present site. In 1885, the line was duplicated, and a second platform was provided, of timber construction.

In 1920, sheds and sidings for bagged wheat were provided, to handle the overflow from the Port of Williamstown. The sidings and sheds have since been removed.

In 1919, electric train services between the city and Essendon were inaugurated, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, and all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941.

The level crossing at Camp Road was initially protected by hand-operated gates, with boom barriers provided in 1961. In 1978, the level crossing was replaced with the current overpass. Barry Road also had a level crossing, which was replaced by the current overpass in 1957, as part of the construction of the standard gauge line. The Riggall Street overpass, about a kilometre north of Broadmeadows, was provided during 1974–1975. In 1971, the current pedestrian underpass, which is located at the up end of the station, was provided.

In 1889, a lever frame in the signal box was installed, and was replaced in 1929, when the Albion-Jacana freight line opened. In 1961, a signal panel was provided at the station. In 1965, mechanical signalling along the line to Essendon was abolished, but it was not until 2000 that solid-state interlocking was provided. In 2007, the control centre was moved to Craigieburn, as part of the extension of suburban electrification to Craigieburn.

The original 1878 station building was demolished in 1988, and was replaced by a new structure, which was opened on 16 March 1990 by then Transport Minister Jim Kennan, as part of a commercial development of the site. On 21 March 1996, Broadmeadows was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2007, suburban electric services were extended to Craigieburn. As part of these works, the siding closest to the standard gauge line (Siding &quot;B&quot;) was abolished and removed in February of that year.

In late 2009, a third platform on the parallel standard gauge line was provided, as part of the North East Rail Revitalisation Project, under which the broad gauge line to Albury was converted to standard gauge and a standard gauge V/Line Albury service was inaugurated.

During World War II, an Army siding was provided to Broadstore, located to the north-east of the station. It opened on 12 October 1942 and remained in place until 1982. The at-grade crossing was abolished in the year that the siding closed, however, the track was not lifted until after 1991. The Broadstore branch was a single un-electrified track, extending in an easterly direction for approximately 1.6 kilometres and terminating at the Maygar Barracks on Camp Road. At one time, it also had a further branch that served a migrant hostel. The Broadstore branch line is marked on maps of the Victorian Railways in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980, terminating at a station marked &quot;Broadstore&quot;.

===Incidents and accidents===
On 14 September 1960, steam locomotive R755, which was hauling a passenger service from Numurkah, was involved in a collision when it rear-ended an Albury – Melbourne goods service at 40 mph (65 km/h). The goods service had been detaching a number of livestock wagons and was given clearance to enter the Albion–Jacana freight line. However, the passenger service, which had been waiting at Craigieburn, was also given clearance. The goods service split when it was moving forward, delaying the train, when the collision occurred. After the accident, R755 was re-railed and moved to the Broadstore branch line. The locomotive was damaged beyond repair and was scrapped in November of that year.

On 3 February 1979, a Numurkah – Geelong bound grain train derailed as it was entering the Albion–Jacana freight line. Eight wagons derailed, and the overhead wires and stanchions were also brought down.

On 14 November 1996, two Comeng train sets collided between Broadmeadows and Jacana, injuring 13 people. It occurred after a city-bound train collided with a stationary Broadmeadows-bound train. Two carriages derailed in the collision.

On 3 February 2003, an unattended Comeng set, led by carriage 394M, rolled away from Broadmeadows station, and ran as far as Spencer Street, where it collided with V/Line locomotive N463, which was leading a Bacchus Marsh-bound train.

<text>Rita Levi-Montalcini ( , ; 22 April 1909 – 30 December 2012) was an Italian neurobiologist. She was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with colleague Stanley Cohen for the discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF).

From 2001 until her death, she also served in the Italian Senate as a Senator for Life. This honor was given due to her significant scientific contributions. On 22 April 2009, she became the first Nobel laureate to reach the age of 100, and the event was feted with a party at Rome&#x27;s City Hall.

==Early life and education==
Levi-Montalcini was born on 22 April 1909 in Turin, to Italian Jewish parents with roots dating back to the Roman Empire. She and her twin sister Paola were the youngest of four children. Her parents were Adele Montalcini, a painter, and Adamo Levi, an electrical engineer and mathematician, whose families had moved from Asti and Casale Monferrato, respectively, to Turin at the turn of the twentieth century.

In her teenage years, she considered becoming a writer and admired Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf, but after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer she decided to attend the University of Turin Medical School. Her father discouraged his daughters from attending college, as he feared it would disrupt their potential lives as wives and mothers, but eventually he supported Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s aspirations to become a doctor. While she was at the University of Turin, the neurohistologist Giuseppe Levi sparked her interest in the developing nervous system. After graduating summa cum laude M.D. in 1936, Montalcini remained at the university as Levi&#x27;s assistant, but her academic career was cut short by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s 1938 Manifesto of Race and the subsequent introduction of laws barring Jews from academic and professional careers.

==Career and research==
During World War II she set up a laboratory in her bedroom in Turin and studied the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, discovering that nerve cells die when they lack targets, and laying the groundwork for much of her later research. She described this experience decades later in the science documentary film &quot;Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times&quot; (1997). The film also features her fraternal twin sister Paola, who became a respected artist best known for her aluminum sculptures designed to bring light to the rooms due to the reflective white surface.

When the Germans invaded Italy in September 1943, her family fled south to Florence, where they survived the Holocaust, under false identities, protected by some non-Jewish friends. During the Nazi occupation, Levi-Montalcini was in contact with the partisans of the Action Party. After the liberation of Florence in August 1944, she volunteered her medical expertise for the Allied health service, providing critical care to those injured during the war. This period highlighted her resilience and commitment to medical science despite the tumultuous circumstances. Upon returning to Turin in 1945, she resumed her research activities.

In September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor Viktor Hamburger at Washington University in St. Louis; he was interested in two of the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals. After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating nerve growth factor (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells. This crucial finding in biology identified NGF as the main protein responsible for the growth of neurons within the nervous system, allowing for major advances in research. The critical experiment was done with Hertha Meyer at the Carlos Chagas Filho Biophysics Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1952. Their publication in 1954 became the first definitive indication of the protein.

By transferring pieces of tumours to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibres. The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumour cells was surprising. When describing it, Montalcini said it is: &quot;like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones.&quot; The nerve growth produced by the tumour was unlike anything she had seen before – the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumour. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumour itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves. Her research led to the seminal publication &quot;In vitro experiments on the effects of mouse sarcomas 180 and 37 on the spinal and sympathetic ganglia of the chick embryo&quot; in 1954, which was a foundational work in identifying and understanding nerve growth factor (NGF). This discovery paved the way for future research in neurobiology and had profound implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases.

She was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962, she established a second laboratory in Rome and divided her time between there and St. Louis. In 1963, she became the first woman to receive the Max Weinstein Award (given by the United Cerebral Palsy Association) due to her significant contributions to neurological research.

From 1961 to 1969, she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the CNR (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978, the Laboratory of Cellular Biology. After she retired in 1977, she was appointed as director of the Institute of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council of Research in Rome. She later retired from that position in 1979, but continued to be involved as a guest professor.

Levi-Montalcini founded the European Brain Research Institute in 2002, and then served as its president. Her role in this institute was at the centre of some criticism from some parts of the scientific community in 2010.

Controversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical concern Fidia. While working for Fidia, she improved her understanding of gangliosides. Beginning in 1975, she supported the drug Cronassial (a particular mixture of gangliosides) produced by Fidia from bovine brain tissue. Independent studies showed that the drug actually could be successful in the treatment of intended diseases (peripheral neuropathies). Years later, some patients under treatment with Cronassial reported a severe neurological syndrome (Guillain–Barré syndrome). As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing the use of the drug in the treatment of diseases where it had not been tested. Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s relationship with the company was revealed during the investigation, and she was criticized publicly.

In the 1990s, she was one of the first scientists to point out the importance of the mast cell in human pathology. In the same period (1993), she identified the endogenous compound palmitoylethanolamide as an important modulator of this cell. Understanding this mechanism initiated a new era of research into this compound which has resulted in more discoveries regarding its mechanisms and benefits, a far better understanding of the endocannabinoid system and new liposomal palmitoylethanolamide product formulations designed specifically for improved absorption and bioavailability.

Levi-Montalcini earned a Nobel Prize along with Stanley Cohen in 1986 in the physiology or medicine category. The two earned their Nobel Prizes for their research into the nerve growth factor (NGF), the protein that causes cell growth due to stimulated nerve tissue.

==Political career==
On 1 August 2001, she was appointed as Senator for Life by the President of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

On 28–29 April 2006, Levi-Montalcini, aged 97, attended the opening assembly of the newly elected Senate, at which the President of the Senate was elected. She declared her preference for the centre-left candidate Franco Marini. Due to her support of the government of Romano Prodi, she was often criticized by some right-wing senators, who accused her of saving the government when the government&#x27;s exiguous majority in the Senate was at risk. Her old age was mocked by far-right politician Francesco Storace.

==Personal life==
Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s father, Adamo Levi, was an electrical engineer and mathematician, and her mother, Adele Montalcini, was a painter. The family&#x27;s Jewish roots extend back to the Roman Empire; due to the family&#x27;s strict and traditional background, Adamo was not supportive of women attending college as it would intrude in their ability to tend to the children and house.
Levi-Montalcini had an older brother Gino, who died after a heart attack in 1974. He was one of the best-known contemporary Italian architects and a professor at the University of Turin. She had two sisters: Anna, five years older than Rita, and Paola, her twin sister, a popular artist who died on 29 September 2000, age 91.

In 2003, she filed a libel suit for defamation against Beppe Grillo. During a show, Grillo called the 94-year-old woman an &quot;old whore&quot;.

Levi-Montalcini never married and had no children. In a 2006 interview, she said, &quot;I never had any hesitation or regrets in this sense... My life has been enriched by excellent human relations, work and interests. I have never felt lonely.&quot; She remained active in scientific research and public life well into her later years, even attending the opening assembly of the newly elected Senate at the age of 97. She died in her home in Rome on 30 December 2012 at the age of 103. In honor of her legacy, numerous institutions, scholarships, and awards have been named after her. For instance, the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation was established to support education and research for young women in Africa and Italy, ensuring her impact on science and society continues to inspire future generations. Additionally, various commemorative events and memorials, including a Google Doodle on her 106th birthday, celebrate her life and contributions to neurobiology.

Upon her death, the Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, stated it was a great loss &quot;for all of humanity.&quot; He praised her as someone who represented &quot;civic conscience, culture and the spirit of research of our time.&quot; Italian astrophysicist Margherita Hack told Sky TG24 TV in a tribute to her fellow scientist, &quot;She is really someone to be admired.&quot; Italy&#x27;s premier, Mario Monti, paid tribute to Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s &quot;charismatic and tenacious&quot; character and for her lifelong endeavour to &quot;defend the battles in which she believed.&quot; Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi praised Levi-Montalcini&#x27;s civil and moral efforts, saying she was an &quot;inspiring&quot; example for Italy and the world.

According to the former President of the Grand Orient of Italy, she was invited and participated in many cultural events organized by the main Italian Masonic organization.

==Awards and honours==

In 1966, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1968, she became the tenth woman elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. She was elected an EMBO Member in 1974.

In 1970, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1986, Levi-Montalcini and collaborator Stanley Cohen received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, as well as the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. This made her the fourth Nobel Prize winner to come from Italy&#x27;s small (less than 50,000 people) but very old Jewish community, after Emilio Segrè, Salvador Luria (a university colleague and friend) and Franco Modigliani.

In 1987, she received the National Medal of Science, the highest American scientific honor.

In 1991, she received the Laurea Honoris Causa in Medicine from the University of Trieste, Italy. On that occasion, she expressed her desire to formulate a Carta of Human Duties as a necessary counterpart of the too much-neglected Declaration of Human Rights. The vision of Rita Levi-Montalcini came true with the issuing of the Trieste Declaration of Human Duties and the foundation in 1993 of the International Council of Human Duties, International Council of Human Duties (ICHD), at the University of Trieste.

She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995.

<text>North Melbourne railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the suburban Craigieburn, Flemington Racecourse, Sunbury, Upfield, Werribee and Williamstown lines; and the regional Seymour line, part of the Melbourne and Victorian railway networks. It serves the inner north-western suburb of West Melbourne, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. North Melbourne is a ground level premium station and major junction, featuring six platforms: two side platforms, and two island platforms with two faces each. It opened on 6 October 1859, with the current station provided in 2009.

The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==History==
The first railway through the site of North Melbourne station was today&#x27;s Williamstown line, and the first section of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company line (to Sunbury), which both opened on 13 January 1859. On 6 October 1859, the first passenger station, with two platforms, was opened, and on 9 June 1886, the present six-platform station opened.

The new station was of free classical architecture. Red brick was used, with cream brick banding, along with verandas and cast iron lace work. As built in 1886, North Melbourne had six platforms, with four platform buildings containing ladies&#x27; toilets and a ladies&#x27; waiting room. The main booking office, waiting room and station master&#x27;s office were near the ramp to Platform 1, and the men&#x27;s toilets and porters&#x27; offices were located under the ramps themselves.

In December 1973, the suburban train stabling yard to the north of the station opened, as part of the City Loop project. The footbridge that links the sidings with the Macaulay maintenance centre was also provided around that time. In 1974, the station buildings on the northern concourse were provided and, in the 1980s, as part of the construction works for the City Loop, the ramps to Platforms 1 and 2 were altered, and the platform extended at the down end.

In May 1995, a washing plant and additional sidings in Melbourne Yard, located to the west of the station, were provided, as part of the Jolimont Yard rationalisation. On 19 July 1996, North Melbourne was upgraded to a premium station.

In May 2006, it was announced that the station was to be redeveloped as part of a $36 million project. Work included a new main entrance at the up (southern) end of the station, with escalators, stairs and lifts installed for quicker access to other platforms and to cater for disabled passengers. Work started in May 2007, and was completed on 16 November 2009. To aid construction and avoid disruption to train passengers, a crash deck was erected over the tracks, to allow trains to run normally underneath while building work continued overhead.

In March 2008, bus route 401 began operating from North Melbourne to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne in Carlton and Parkville, removing the need for passengers to those destinations to travel via the City Loop.

After December 2013, V/Line Geelong and Warrnambool services no longer stopped at the station, due to the opening of the first section of the Regional Rail Link (RRL) between Southern Cross and South Kensington. The line runs to the west of North Melbourne, but no platforms were provided. On 11 July 2014, Ballarat, Ararat, Bendigo, Swan Hill and Echuca line services also ceased stopping at North Melbourne, having moved to the RRL tracks.

In November 2017, the Victorian State Government announced that North Melbourne would be renamed West Melbourne, to better reflect its geographical location, and to allow one of the new stations constructed as part of the Metro Tunnel project to be named North Melbourne. The change was abandoned in 2020, with the Metro Tunnel station being named Arden instead.

== Platforms, facilities and services ==
North Melbourne has six platforms: two side platforms and two island platforms with four faces. It is served by Craigieburn, Sunbury, Upfield, Werribee and Williamstown line trains, as well as V/Line Seymour and Shepparton line services.

The main station entrance is at the southern end of the platforms, at the intersection of Adderley and Dryburgh Streets. The station building contains the main booking office, public toilets and a kiosk, with platform access via escalators and lifts. At the north end, the original asphalt ramps link all six platforms, with Platforms 2 through to 6 having heritage-listed verandas and brick waiting rooms.

At the north end of the station are 1970s-era brown brick buildings, built over the former Dynon Road overpass, which include public toilets and the former railway parcels office. Until November 2009, that building was also the main exit to Ireland Street and Railway Place, and contained the booking office and a kiosk, until those facilities were moved to the new concourse at the south end. The north end also has an exit leading west to the Melbourne Yard rail freight terminal, which is not open to public access.

<text>Macaulay railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the inner-northern suburb of North Melbourne, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Macaulay station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 December 1887, with the current station provided in 1976.

Initially opened as Macaulay Road, the station was given its current name of Macaulay on 1 May 1909.

The station is located beside the Moonee Ponds Creek to its west, and surrounded mainly by factories and warehouses. Kensington, on the Craigieburn line, is only west of Macaulay, and is significantly closer to the residential area and handles a larger number of commuters.

The station is also located at ground level, beneath the CityLink tollway, which is supported atop concrete columns that are located outside the platform fencing.

==History==

Macaulay station opened on 1 December 1887, three years after the railway line from North Melbourne was extended to Coburg. The station is named after Macaulay Road, itself named after Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British politician and historian.

To the east of the station were a number of goods sidings, which opened after 1919, and have since been removed.

In May 1972, the suburban train stabling yard near the station, located towards North Melbourne, opened, as part of the City Loop project. Also in that year, automatic signalling was provided between Macaulay and Royal Park, replacing Double Line Block signalling, and boom barriers replacing interlocked gates at the Macaulay Road level crossing, located at the up end of the station, as well as the abolishment of the signal box. On 1 July 1975, parcel facilities at the station were abolished. In 1976, the current station buildings were provided.

On 17 November 1993, a light repair facility officially opened in the stabling yard, as part of the closure of the Jolimont Workshops. In 1997, a crossover at the down end of the station was abolished.

== Platforms and services ==

Macaulay has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Upfield line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

<text>Flemington Bridge railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the inner-northern suburb of Flemington, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Flemington Bridge station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 10 April 1885.

Initially opened as Flemington, the station was given its current name of Flemington Bridge on 3 December 1885.

The station is located on an embankment between the Mount Alexander Road and Racecourse Road rail overpasses. An overpass on the CityLink tollway is located a short distance west of the station.

== History ==
The station opened seven months after the railway line from North Melbourne was extended to Coburg, and was named after the nearby bridge on Flemington Road that passes over the Moonee Ponds Creek. Originally built in 1851, to improve the connection for gold prospectors travelling to the Bendigo goldfields, the bridge was named &quot;Mains Bridge&quot;, after James Patrick Mains, a well-known contractor. It was later renamed &quot;Flemington Road Bridge&quot;, before being shortened to &quot;Flemington Bridge&quot;.

In 1886, permanent station buildings were erected at the station, with timber stairs leading to Boundary and Mount Alexander Roads.

In 1891, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways recommended the construction of a spur line from Flemington Bridge to Pascoe Vale, to relieve crowding on the Essendon line at peak times, as well as providing a shorter alternative route to the city, following the route of what is now CityLink. The committee estimated the single track line would cost £93,000 to build, but recommended that only £30,000 be spent, with the remainder to be made up by donated land. However, the proposal was not taken up by government.

In 1944, the current station buildings, with asbestos cement roofs, were provided and, at the same time, the stairs were replaced by asphalted ramps.

In 1997, to allow construction of an elevated section of CityLink between Flemington Bridge and North Melbourne, a temporary crossover was provided near the Mount Alexander Road bridge, to allow Upfield line trains to terminate, and passengers were shuttled by bus to Newmarket station to continue their journey.

== Platforms and services ==
Flemington Bridge has two side platforms. It is served by Upfield line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upfield

<text>Royal Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Parkville in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Royal Park station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 9 September 1884.

It is located in the park of the same name, and is the nearest station to Melbourne Zoo. A disused signal box is located at the up end of Platform 1.

==History==

Royal Park station opened on 9 September 1884, when the railway line was extended from North Melbourne to Coburg. The original plan for the route of the line through Royal Park was to be east of the Zoological Gardens, but after local protests against the destruction of the park, a decision was made to build the line to the west for &quot;reasons of economy&quot;. On opening, only temporary station buildings were provided, along with a signal box and gatekeepers cottage.

On 8 May 1888, Royal Park became a junction, with the opening of the Inner Circle line, to both Clifton Hill and Northcote. At the same time, a timber station building and station masters residence were erected. Between 1889 and 1912, there was a goods siding near the station, named Royal Park Cutting Siding.

In 1920, the current station building on Platform 1 opened, after the original station building was destroyed by fire in 1919. It opened with a tile roof in the &quot;Gisborne style&quot; and, in 1936, a new waiting shed and ticket office replaced earlier structures on Platform 2.

In 1971, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Poplar Road level crossing, located at the up end of the station, when automatic signaling reached the station from Jewell, with automatic signaling extended to Macaulay in 1972. In 1981, the Inner Circle line (by then a goods-only stub to Fitzroy) was closed and, in 1989, the waiting shed on Platform 2 was destroyed by arson. In 1994, the signal box on Platform 1 was closed.

<text>Jewell railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Brunswick in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Jewell station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 9 September 1884.

Initially opened as South Brunswick, the station was given its current name of Jewell on 1 February 1954.

A disused goods shed is located next to the entrance to Platform 1, and a disused signal box is located at the down end of the station, next to the Union Street level crossing. The main station building, signal box and level crossing gates are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

== History ==
Jewell station opened when the railway line from North Melbourne was extended to Coburg. It was renamed in honour of a long-serving member of the State Parliament, James Jewell, who represented the Brunswick electorate from 1910 to 1949.

In 1971, automatic signalling was provided between Jewell and Royal Park, replacing double line block signalling. The goods yard was closed to traffic in 1977. Former siding &quot;B&quot; was also abolished in that year.

In 1997, siding &quot;A&quot;, a crossover, and a number of points and signal discs at the station were abolished. In August 1998, the former level crossing at Barkly Street, at the up end of the station, was closed to vehicle traffic. In September of that year, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Union Street level crossing at the down end of the station. The signal box protecting the level crossing was also abolished during that time.

In June 2012, VicTrack announced its intention to revamp the station as part of a mixed development that could include station restoration, enhanced open space, and a new commercial and residential development adjacent to the eastern side of the station. A program of community consultation was undertaken to find out local people&#x27;s priorities for any alterations. Safety and better access were identified as main the concerns. VicTrack was to seek interest from developers in 2013. In 2018, upgrades to the station were completed.

On 19 September 2022, it was announced that the Union Street level crossing would be removed by grade separation as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project and would be elevated, along with seven other level crossings in Brunswick.

On 19 September 2024, it was announced that Jewell station, along with Brunswick and Anstey stations would be replaced by two new stations located approximately 200 metres to 450 metres from all three existing stations. Jewell station would be replaced by a new station located between Union Street and Dawson Street, just 200 metres and north of the existing station and the eight level crossings to be elevated and removed by 2030. It was also announced that the heritage listed station building on Platform 1 at the existing station and some heritage listed interlocking hand gates at some closed level crossings will be kept and located at its current spot.

The decision to build two stations in different locations instead of rebuilding Jewell, Brunswick and Anstey generated significant criticism from residents and the local council. Local newspaper Brunswick Voice reported that the Minister for Transport Infrastructure, Danny Pearson, claimed &quot;the decision to build two stations followed 18 months of technical and engineering assessments which found fewer stations would boost capacity on the line in the future and deliver more open space&quot;, noting that &quot;[the government claimed] the plan would also minimise the impact to heritage in the area, but [the politician] provided no detail about whether the three station buildings and the historic boom gate operators&#x27; cabins would be preserved&quot;.

==Platforms and services==
Jewell has two side platforms. It is served by Upfield line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upfield

Brunswick station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 9 September 1884.

The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

== History ==
Brunswick station opened when the railway line from North Melbourne was extended to Coburg. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after &quot;Brunswick Park&quot;, a property that was purchased by Thomas Wilkinson and a partner. &quot;Brunswick Park&quot; was named in honour of either Princess Caroline of Brunswick, or the 1840 marriage of Queen Victoria to Prince Albert, of the royal house of Brunswick.

Brunswick had a goods yard which closed in 1966. The goods siding and associated points and signal discs were abolished in that same year. In 1972, the station platforms were lengthened.

Just after 4:45am on 2 August 1977, a seven-car Harris train set rolled away from Gowrie, after the driver and guard were changing ends after taking the train out of a siding, because it was scheduled to operate a city-bound service from Upfield. The train passed through fifteen level crossings and destroyed seven sets of hand gates, before stopping just south of Brunswick, between the Albert and Dawson Streets level crossings.

In 1998, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the Albert Street level crossing, at the up end of the station, and replaced interlocked gates at the Victoria Street level crossing, at the down end of the station. The signal box protecting Victoria Street was also abolished during that time.

On 19 September 2022, it was announced that the Albert Street and Victoria Street level crossings would be removed by grade separation and elevated as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, along with six other level crossings in Brunswick.

On 19 September 2024, it was announced that Brunswick station, along with Jewell and Anstey stations would be replaced by two new stations which are both currently planned to be located approximately 450 metres from the existing Brunswick station. The new southern station is planned to be located next to Union Street and Dawson Street, while the new northern station is planned to be located next to Hope Street and the eight level crossings to be elevated and removed by 2030. It was also announced that the heritage listed station building on Platform 1 at the existing station and some heritage listed interlocking hand gates at some closed level crossings will be kept and located at its current spot.

The decision to build two stations in different locations instead of rebuilding Jewell, Brunswick and Anstey generated significant criticism from residents and the local council.

<text>Anstey railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Brunswick in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Anstey station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 15 December 1926.

Initially opened as North Brunswick, the station was given its current name of Anstey on 1 December 1942.

== History ==
Anstey station was renamed in honour of former member of parliament, Frank Anstey, who represented the local area in the seats of East Bourke Boroughs and Brunswick in the state parliament, and Burke in the federal parliament, between 1902 and 1934.

In 1971, the station platforms were lengthened. In 1998, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Albion Street level crossing, at the down end of the station. The signal box controlling the level crossing was also abolished during that time.

In 2020, the station became a temporary terminus while level crossing removals occurred at Coburg and Moreland. A temporary crossover was provided at the up end of the station, to allow trains to terminate and return to Flinders Street.

On 19 September 2022, it was announced that the Albion Street level crossing would be removed by grade separation as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project and would be elevated, along with seven other level crossings in Brunswick.

On 19 September 2024, it was announced that Anstey station, along with Brunswick and Jewell stations would be replaced by two new stations located approximately 200 metres to 450 metres from all three existing stations. Anstey station would be replaced by a new station located next to Hope Street, just 200 metres and south of the existing station and the eight level crossings to be elevated and removed by 2030.

<text>Moreland railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Coburg in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Moreland station is an elevated unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 9 September 1884, with the current station provided in 2020.

==History==

Moreland station opened when the railway line from North Melbourne was extended to Coburg. 

The name Moreland has been associated with the local area since 1839 when land speculator Farquhar McCrae acquired 638 acres of land between the Moonee Ponds Creek and Sydney Road.
McCrae named this land Moreland after the Jamaican slave plantation that was run by his father and grandfather. The landholdings were increased in 1841 to encompass a total of 908 acres, which was subdivided in 1858 including the establishment of Moreland Road. 

On 2 May 1975, the former ground-level station was damaged by fire.

In 1983, a number of sidings at the station were dismantled. In 1986, manually controlled boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Moreland Road level crossing, which was at the up end of the station. In August 1988, former sidings &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; and associated point work were abolished. Also abolished were the up and down end crossovers, and a number of disc signals.

On 7 May 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Moreland Road and Reynard Street level crossings would be removed by grade separation. On 12 June 2019, the designs for the new, rebuilt station was announced.

On 27 July 2020, the Moreland Road and Reynard Street level crossings and equipment were eliminated and on the same night, the ground level station was closed and demolished and the Platform 1 heritage building restored during these works. On 2 November 2020, trains started running through the new elevated rail bridge after a four month closure. On 14 December 2020, the rebuilt station opened to passengers.

== Platforms and services ==

Moreland has two side platforms. It is served by Upfield line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

== Description ==

Coburg railway station is located in the northern suburb of Coburg in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency and the station is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is or around a 25 minute train ride to Flinders Street. The adjacent stations are Moreland station up towards Flinders Street and Batman station down towards Upfield.

The station consists of two side platforms with two edges. As is standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on edges. The side platforms are approximately long, long enough for a 7 car High Capacity Metro Train. The station features a ground level concourse, accessible by stairs and lifts up to the elevated platforms. There is one main station building, opened in 2020, which contains a waiting room, a customer service,PSO office and a ground level concourse inside the main station building. The station building presents as a civic gesture drawing abstract references to the formal language of classical architecture and has decorative features such as friezes, hexagonal reliefs on the pre-cast elements and the primary colours of the station are orange.

The station building, concourse and platform largely stayed the same since the station was rebuilt in 2020. There are 120 parking spaces, including 2 accessible parking spaces and 26 protected bike parking at the station. The station is listed as fully accessible on the Metro Trains website, as there are lifts and accessible features available at the station.

== History ==
Coburg station opened on 9 September 1884 as the terminus when the railway line was extended from North Melbourne. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the Duke of Edinburgh, a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The suburb was renamed from Pentridge to Coburg in 1870, when the Duke was planning to visit the colony.

On 8 October 1889, the line was extended to Somerton, where it junctioned with the main North East railway line to Albury. On 13 July 1903, the line beyond Coburg was closed, but was reopened to Fawkner on 13 November 1906. On 2 December 1920, the line to Coburg was electrified.

In 1962, boom barriers replaced hand-operated gates at the former Bell Street level crossing, which was at the down end of the station. In 1972, the former ground-level station building was refurbished.

A signal box was located at the up end of the station, directly opposite the former Munro Street level crossing. It was provided in 1928 to control the interlocked gates at the former level crossing, and replaced the original signal box. In 1983, boom barriers replaced the interlocked gates.

Although the line from Coburg to Fawkner was duplicated in 1959, Coburg continued to have only one side platform, used by trains travelling in both directions. On 11 September 1995, an additional platform (Platform 2) was provided. On 28 June 1996, Coburg was upgraded to a premium station, featuring the addition of customer service facilities and the conversion of the now heritage station building into a waiting room.

On 7 May 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Bell Street and Munro Street level crossings would be removed by grade separation. On 12 June 2019, the designs for the new, rebuilt station was announced.

On 27 July 2020, the Bell Street and Munro Street level crossings and equipment were eliminated and on the same night, the ground level station was closed and demolished and the Platform 1 heritage building restored during these works. On 2 November 2020, trains started running through the new elevated rail bridge after a four month closure. On 14 December 2020, the rebuilt station opened to passengers.

<text>Batman railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Coburg North in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Batman station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 1959. It initially closed on 13 July 1903, then reopened on 1 October 1914.

Initially opened as Bell Park, the station was given its current name of Batman on 1 October 1914.

==History==
Batman station opened when the railway line was extended from Coburg to Somerton. It was named after one of the founders of Melbourne, John Batman.

In 1920, a siding for the former Lincoln Mills knitting works on Gaffney Street was provided. In 1959, the current island platform was provided, when the line was duplicated between Coburg and Fawkner.

In 1970, the siding serving the Lincoln Mills knitting works was abolished, along with the associated signal discs and posts. In 1982, a crossover at the station was abolished, along with a number of signals and levers.

There is a disused signal box at the up end of the station, which was provided in 1935, controlling interlocked gates at the Gaffney Street level crossing. In 1998, the gates were replaced with boom barriers, when the Upfield line was upgraded.

== Platforms and services ==

<text>Merlynston railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Coburg North in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Merlynston station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 1959. It initially closed on 13 July 1903, then reopened on 1 October 1914.

Initially opened as North Coburg, the station was given its current name of Merlynston on 6 February 1922.

==History==
Merlynston station opened when the railway line was extended from Coburg to Somerton. The locality was named by Donald Bain who, in 1919, purchased 31 hectares of land to be subdivided into a housing estate. Bain named the estate after his daughter, Merlyn.

In 1948, flashing light signals were provided at the Boundary Road level crossing, in the down direction from the station. In 1959, the current island platform was provided when the line was duplicated between Coburg and Fawkner.

In 1984, boom barriers were provided at the Boundary Road level crossing.

In November 1998, the level crossing at Shorts Road, south of the station, was closed, and a dead-end street was created on either side of the railway line. Until the track was duplicated to Gowrie in that year, the line north of the station had only a single track, apart from the island platform at Gowrie, which had two platforms. However, one of those was a dock platform, meaning trains couldn&#x27;t pass each other at Gowrie, and had to do so at Merlynston.

On 9 April 2002, Comeng motor carriage 533M was destroyed by a fire at the station. The fire also damaged part of the station building.

== Platforms and services ==
Merlynston has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Metro Trains&#x27; Upfield line trains.

<text>Fawkner railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Hadfield in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Fawkner station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 1998. It initially closed on 13 July 1903, then reopened on 12 December 1906.

Initially opened as Fawkner, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Fawkner Cemetery upon its reopening on 12 December 1906, then was given its current name of Fawkner in 1914.

==History==

Fawkner station originally opened on 8 October 1889, when the railway line from Coburg was extended to Somerton. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after John Pascoe Fawkner, one of the founders of Melbourne.

It is located adjacent to the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park, which opened in 1906, and from then until 1939, special mortuary trains operated. From October 1914, only seven trains operated to Fawkner daily, as well as the daily mortuary train to the cemetery. A former mortuary van is located near the entrance to Platform 2.

From 1920, Fawkner was the extent of suburban electrified services. From 1928 until 1959, an AEC railmotor was used to provide a connecting service north to Somerton. In that year, electrified services were extended to Upfield.

Also in 1959, flashing light signals were provided at the Cemetery Entrance level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station, and the line from Coburg was duplicated. However, the duplicated line converged at the up end of the station and, until 1998, the station had one platform (present day Platform 2). The second track and Platform 1 were added as part of the duplication of the line to Gowrie. Also in that year, boom barriers were provided at the Cemetery Entrance level crossing.

== Platforms and services ==

Fawkner has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Upfield line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Upfield

<text>Gowrie railway station is a commuter railway station on the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Fawkner in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Gowrie station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 17 May 1965.

==History==
===1928–1956===
On 16 October 1928, after the reinstatement of a passenger service on the Fawkner – Somerton line in March of that year, Rail Motor Stopping Place No. 21 opened at the site of the present Gowrie station. It was closed on 5 May 1956, when the passenger service ceased.

===1965–present===
On 17 May 1965, Gowrie station opened in its current form, on what was by then the Upfield line. The name of the station derives from a former grazing property called &quot;Gowrie Park&quot;, which the owner named after Gowrie, in the UK. The Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park is located on part of the former property.

Just after 4:45am on 2 August 1977, a seven-car Harris train set rolled away from the station when the driver and guard were changing ends, having taken the train out of a siding, prior to operating a city-bound service from Upfield. The train passed through fifteen level crossings and destroyed seven sets of hand gates before stopping just after Brunswick, between the Albert and Dawson Streets level crossings.

In 1998, Gowrie was upgraded to a premium station. Also in that year, the track from Fawkner to Gowrie was duplicated and boom barriers were provided at the Box Forest Road level crossing, in the up direction from the station. Immediately north of the station, the double track merges into a single track, which continues to the terminus at Upfield. Prior to 1998, Platform 1 was a dock platform for terminating trains, which meant that trains could not pass each other there, but had to do so further down the line at Merlynston.

Under the 2013 PTV Network Development Plan, the line between Gowrie and Upfield was to be duplicated, and the line to Roxburgh Park reinstated. That was to include a flyover across the North East standard gauge line, to allow Seymour V/Line services to run via Upfield, and eventual electrification of the line to Wallan.

== Platforms and services ==
Gowrie has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Upfield line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

<text>Upfield railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Upfield line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the northern suburb of Campbellfield in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Upfield station is a ground-level premium station, featuring a single platform. It opened on 8 October 1889, with the current station provided in 1963. It initially closed on 13 July 1903 and 5 May 1956, it was then reopened on 5 March 1928 and 17 August 1959.

Initially opened as North Campbellfield, the station was given its current name of Upfield on 17 August 1959.

==History==
The original station on the site opened when the railway from Coburg was extended to Somerton in 1889. The current station was opened on 17 August 1959, especially to serve workers at the nearby Ford factory, with the line from Fawkner to Somerton being reopened and electrified as far as Upfield. The name of the station comes from the open country in the area at the time of its 1959 opening.

During 1963–1964, the present station building was constructed. In 1965, flashing light signals were provided at the Barry Road level crossing, located at the up end of the station.

There is a train stabling yard north of the station, which opened in 1997. Also in that year, a signal panel was installed. In 1998, boom barriers were provided at the Barry Road level crossing, as part of upgrade works along the Upfield line.

During 2002–2003, the station was refurbished and, in December 2007, Upfield was upgraded to a premium station. In 2011, an extra stabling siding (Siding &quot;A&quot;) was provided.

Under the PTV Network Development Plan, released in 2013, the section of the line between Upfield and Roxburgh Park was to be reinstated, and would include a flyover across the North East standard gauge line. That would allow V/Line services to Seymour to operate via Upfield, and would facilitate the eventual electrification of the line to Wallan.

On 30 June 2019, the Upfield signal panel was abolished, and control was transferred to Metrol.

== Platforms and services ==
Upfield has one side platform. It is served by Upfield line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

==Transport links==

Broadmeadows Bus Service operates two routes via Upfield station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : to North Coburg
* : Craigieburn station – Broadmeadows station

Dysons operates one bus route to and from Upfield station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<text>South Kensington railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee and Williamstown lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the inner north-western suburb of Kensington in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. South Kensington is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 11 March 1891, with the current station provided in 1975.

Freight lines run to the south of the station. The closest of those lines are used by V/Line to reverse empty services from Traralgon and Bairnsdale, while the tracks further south are used by a variety of standard gauge freight operators. The lines to the east join Melbourne Yard, while those to the west are the South Kensington–West Footscray set of lines that lead to either South Dynon or West Footscray, via the Bunbury Street tunnel.

All the private sidings that formerly existed around South Kensington have now been closed. They included a siding to a large wool store to the north-east (now demolished), one to a warehouse and silos to the east (open but no longer served by rail), and two sidings to the north serving the Melbourne City Council abattoirs and Kenstore, a military warehouse complex that opened during World War II.

The current configuration of the station dates from 2014, as part of the Regional Rail Link (RRL) project. The goods-only tracks immediately to the south of the station were replaced by a pair of tracks used by regional passenger services operating to and from Southern Cross. The signal box, formerly located at the up end of the down platform (Platform 2), was demolished to make way for the new RRL tracks. A mural outside the station on Childers Street was funded by the City–Maribyrnong River arm of the project, but it has since been painted over.

==History==
In 1972, the platforms were extended at the down end of the station. In 1975, the present platform shelters were provided, when the station was modified to accommodate the quadruplication of the line to Footscray. The disused station office, located near the entrance to the pedestrian underpass on Childers Street, was also provided around that time. On 1 July of that year, parcel facilities at the station were abolished. The following year, in November 1976, the quadruplicated line between South Kensington and Footscray was provided.

In 2020, in a survey conducted by the RACV, South Kensington was ranked as the worst railway station in Victoria.

==Platforms and services==
South Kensington has two side platforms. It is served by Werribee and Williamstown trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Laverton via Altona (weekdays only); all stations services to Werribee
* all stations services to Williamstown

<text>Footscray railway station is a commuter and regional railway station and the junction point for the Sunbury, Werribee and Williamstown lines and V/Line services to Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong, part of the Metropolitan and Regional railway networks. It serves the western Melbourne suburb of Footscray in Victoria, Australia. Footscray is a ground level premium station, featuring six platforms, two island platform with two faces and two side platform, connected by an accessible overground concourse. It opened on 17 January 1859, with the current location provided in 1900 and station provided in 2014.

A disused signal box is located on the island platform at the up end of Platform 5. A pair of dual gauge tracks for the South Kensington–West Footscray line run in a cutting under the station before entering the Bunbury Street tunnel, providing a rail link to the Port of Melbourne and other freight terminals, as well as access to Southern Cross station for the NSW TrainLink XPT, &quot;The Overland&quot;, and V/Line Albury passenger services.

== History ==
On 17 January 1859, the railway arrived in Footscray, when the Williamstown line opened, with trains operating from Spencer Street in Melbourne to the important port of Williamstown. The line between Melbourne and Williamstown, via the North Melbourne and Footscray, had been made possible by the construction of the Saltwater River Rail Bridge over the Maribyrnong River.

Not long after, that line was connected to the 18-month-old Geelong line at a junction near the current Newport station. The original Footscray station opened on the first day of service. It was not where the current Footscray station is but was located at Napier Street.

Less than a month later, on 10 February 1859, Footscray became a junction when a line, branching at Footscray, was opened to Sunbury, extended to Sandhurst (later renamed Bendigo) in 1862. On 1 March 1859, Footscray&#x27;s second station, on the Sunbury line, opened at Nicholson Street, not far from the Napier Street location. In 1879, a signal box was provided at the junction.

On 16 September 1900, a new station was opened at the present location, the junction of the two lines. The two other stations were then closed.

A number of sidings once existed at the station, but that site, on the eastern side of the Newport-bound lines, is now used for car parking. In 1972, the last siding at Footscray (siding &quot;B&quot;) was abolished.

On 21 October 1928, the two tracks under the station were opened, as part of the South Kensington–West Footscray line. They were dual-gauged in the early 1960s, as part of the construction of the Melbourne–Albury standard gauge line. Quadruplication of the tracks towards Melbourne in November 1976 eliminated the switched junction and so the signal box was closed, although the building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

On 31 May 1996, Footscray was upgraded to a premium station, although the enclosed waiting area and ticket facilities were built in 1993, as part of the &quot;Travel Safe&quot; program of the early 1990s.

At around 08:30 on 5 June 2001, on Platform 4, an out-of-service train heading to Newport collided with a Williamstown-bound train carrying about 20 passengers. Three injuries were reported.

In 2010, as a part of the Brumby State Government&#x27;s Footscray renewal program, the footbridge over the platforms, which was accessed by ramps, was replaced with a new $15 million footbridge. The bridge, named after Indigenous activist William Cooper, had stairs and associated lifts. There were complaints that the new footbridge was less usable than the one it replaced. The roof was not weatherproof, and the lifts were prone to breakdown.

During the 2017/2018 financial year, Footscray was the sixth-busiest station on the Melbourne metropolitan network, with 5.26 million passenger movements recorded.

=== Regional Rail Link upgrade ===
From 2012 to 2014, Footscray station underwent a major upgrade and conservation works as part of the Regional Rail Link project. An additional two platforms were provided to the north of the existing ones, to allow the separation of Sunbury Metro train services and V/Line train services to Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. On 20 January 2014, coinciding with the opening of the new platforms, ticket office and a waiting area adjacent to Platform 1 on Irving Street, Platforms 1 to 4 were renumbered 3 to 6, with the new platforms becoming Platforms 1 and 2. At the same time, Platforms 3 and 4 were temporarily closed, so that they could be rebuilt as platforms for V/Line services. They reopened when the new Regional Rail Link tracks between Sunshine and Southern Cross were brought into service on 16 July 2014. A new waiting area and toilet facilities for regional services was provided between Platforms 4 and 5.

The $15 million footbridge, erected in 2010, was partially demolished in 2013 to accommodate the works. New canopies, stairs and escalators were installed at the Irving and Hyde Street ends of the footbridge, and wider ramps were built from the footbridge to the platforms and the street level, to allow easier access to the platforms. New lifts were also added to the structure.

The car-park on Irving Street was relocated to McNab Avenue, and a new forecourt, with greenery and seating areas was opened, along with two new kiosks, close to the Irving Street station entrance.

<text>Seddon railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee and Williamstown lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of the same name, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station opened on 10 December 1906, and the current station buildings date from 1981.

==History==
Seddon station, like the suburb itself, was named after Richard John Seddon, who had worked at the Newport railway workshops, was a corporal in the artillery at Williamstown, and was Prime Minister of New Zealand between 1893-1906.

The station opened as a double line block post with a signal box for the control of trains, in the section from Footscray to Yarraville. The block post closed in 1912, but automatic signalling was not provided on the section until 1927.

In 1972, both platforms were extended. In 1980, the former timber buildings were demolished, and were replaced with the current station buildings.

==Platforms and services==
Seddon has two side platforms and is served by Werribee and Williamstown line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Laverton via Altona (weekdays only); all stations services to Werribee
* all stations services to Williamstown

<doc id="708086" wikidata="Q1369568" url="?curid=708086" title="Kobayakawa Hideaki">
<text>(1577 – December 1, 1602) was the fifth son of Kinoshita Iesada and a nephew of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He was gained the rank of &quot;Saemon no Kami&quot; (左衛門督) or in China &quot;Shikkingo&quot; (執金吾) at genpuku and held the court title of &quot;Chūnagon&quot; (中納言), Hideaki was also called &quot;Kingo Chūnagon&quot; (金吾中納言).

==Biography==
He was adopted by Hideyoshi and called himself &quot;Hashiba Hidetoshi&quot; (羽柴 秀俊). He was then again adopted by Kobayakawa Takakage, becoming &quot;Kobayakawa Hidetoshi&quot; (小早川 秀俊). He then renamed himself &quot;Hideaki&quot; (秀秋) after Takakage&#x27;s death. Shortly after the Battle of Sekigahara, he renamed one last time to &quot;Kobayakawa Hideaki&quot; (小早川 秀詮).

During the Siege of Ulsan he led reinforcements to rescue Ulsan Castle from Joseon-Ming allied forces that were besieging the castle. Fighting on the front line with a spear, he managed to capture an enemy commander and broke the siege. However, Hideyoshi chastised him for making a dangerous and reckless charge (as he was overall commander, an adverse outcome could have had severe consequences) and deprived him of his domain Chikugo when he returned to Japan. Kobayakawa, angered by this, he believed the rumor circulated by Tokugawa Ieyasu that this had been the doing of a jealous Ishida Mitsunari. He never forgot nor forgave Mitsunari and worked to undermine his position.

Kobayakawa was known to attack women and children during the campaigns in Korea, an act that was despised by many of his fellow commanders.

==Battle of Sekigahara==

Before the battle of Sekigahara, Kobayakawa happened to be in Osaka and gave aid to Mitsunari in the Siege of Fushimi. He acted as though he would go along with Mitsunari, even though he intended to betray him, having secretly communicated with Ieyasu. Knowing Kobayakawa held ill feelings, Mitsunari and Ōtani Yoshitsugu promised him two additional domains around Osaka and the position of kampaku (until Toyotomi Hideyori grew old enough to rule) if he helped them to victory.

Even after the battle began, Kobayakawa kept his intentions hidden. Ieyasu&#x27;s force (east) was not faring well against Mitsunari&#x27;s force (west); Ukita Hideie was winning against Fukushima Masanori and Ōtani Yoshitsugu was also winning against Tōdō Takatora. Kobayakawa was hesitant to participate with either side. According to some later historial accounts of the battle, Ieyasu ordered troops to fire blanks against the Kobayakawa troops to force them into action. Kobayakawa then ordered an attack on the Otani troops, and while this attack was beaten back temporarily, his action forced the other armies who had pledged betrayal to also turn. However, more recently, some historians have argued that &quot;the earliest accounts of Sekigahara show that Hideaki&#x27;s so-called treachery happened when the battle began, not halfway through&quot;, and that the &quot;story about Ieyasu ordering ‘probing shots’ to be fired into his ranks is therefore a complete myth.&quot; 

Historian Junji Mitsunari viewed the defection of Hideaki during the battle was not solely his decision, but it is also a collective intention of the entire Kobayakawa clan, as his vassals also urged Hideaki to change side to the Eastern Army.

Kobayakawa also experienced success in the mopping up operations that followed, defeating Mitsunari&#x27;s father, Ishida Masatsugu in the Siege of Sawayama.

==Death==
Once the dust had settled, Kobayakawa was given the defeated Ukita clan&#x27;s former fiefdoms of Bizen and Mimasaka, for a total of 550,000 koku. However, Kobayakawa drank himself to death two years later after supposedly going mad, and with no one to succeed him, the Kobayakawa clan disbanded, and his fiefdoms were absorbed by the neighboring Ikeda clan.

<text>Yarraville railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee and Williamstown lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the inner-western suburb of the same name, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station opened on 20 November 1871 as South Footscray.

==History==
Yarraville station opened twelve years after the line from Footscray was extended to Newport. Like the suburb, the station was named after the &quot;Yarraville&quot; real estate development, which was promoted by Biers, Henningham &amp; Co. Land sales began in 1859.

In 1892, the present station buildings were provided, replacing timber buildings that had been destroyed by fire in 1890. The station opened to goods traffic in 1883 and, in 1893, a goods shed that had been at South Morang was relocated to Yarraville. In 1912, an extension of the yard was provided at the up end.

By July 1969, the station had been closed to goods traffic, with the goods shed demolished shortly after. In 1970, an overpass replaced a level crossing at nearby Somerville Road and, in 1991, the goods yard was removed. Interlocked crossing gates, controlled from a signal box at the down end of Platform 1, protected the Anderson Street level crossing until 1995, when the gates were fixed in the open position and replaced by boom barriers, leading to the closure of the signal box the next year. In 1997, a pedestrian subway under the line in Anderson Street was filled in and replaced by pedestrian gates. 

In October 2022, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Anderson Street level crossing would be closed to vehicular traffic by 2030, and would be replaced by a pedestrian subway.

==Platforms and services==
Yarraville has two side platform and is served by Werribee and Williamstown trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:

<text>Spotswood railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee and Williamstown lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Spotswood, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and opened on 1 December 1878.

Initially opened as Edom, the station has been renamed three times: to Bayswater on 1 September 1881, Spottiswoode on 1 October of that year, and Spotswood on 1 August 1905.

==History==
As with the suburb it serves, the station was named after John Stewart Spottiswoode, who purchased land in the area in 1841.

Over the years, a number of sidings were provided for businesses in the area. In 1914, a branch line was opened at the down end of the station to the Newport Power Station, in addition to a number of other sidings serving oil terminals in the area. A siding at the up end of the station served the Australian Glass Manufacturers factory, and was used to receive sand trains from Koala Siding (near Nyora on the South Gippsland line). The last sand train operated on 15 January 1998.

In 1972, both platforms were extended. In 1988, a number of points and dwarf signals at the station were abolished. In 1989, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Hudson Road level crossing, located at the up end of the station.

In 1994, a number of alterations occurred at the station, including the removal of a crossover at the down end, as well as the overhead wire for siding &quot;K&quot;, the connections for siding &quot;K&quot; and the oil sidings, and a number of points and signals.

There is a disused signal box at the up end of Platform 1, which was decommissioned on 12 August 2001, along with the removal of the crossover at the up end, a number of dwarf signals, and a siding. In 2007, the remains of some sidings that ran along public roads in the area were removed by Hobsons Bay Council.

On 26 October 2022, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the level crossing would be grade separated by 2030, with the railway line likely to be rebuilt over the road, including a new station.

==Platforms and services==
Spotswood has two side platforms and is served by Werribee and Williamstown line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Laverton via Altona (weekdays only); all stations services to Werribee
* all stations services to Williamstown

<text>Newport railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction point on the Werribee and Williamstown lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Newport, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Newport station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 March 1859.

Initially opened as Geelong Junction, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Williamstown Junction in January 1869, then was given its current name of Newport on 1 November 1881.

Two sidings exist at the northern (up) end of the station, used for the stabling of trains that operate the Williamstown and Altona line shuttle services. The Western standard gauge line to Adelaide runs to the west of the station, behind Platform 1, and the Newport Railway Workshops are located to the south.

==History==
In 1857, two years before the station opened, the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company had opened its railway line from Geelong to Newport but, because the line from Melbourne to Newport was not yet complete, a track was constructed along North Road to a temporary terminus on the bank of the Yarra River at Greenwich, from where passengers were conveyed to Melbourne by ferry. In October of that year, the line from Melbourne to Williamstown, via Newport, was opened, and the Geelong line was connected to it.

In 1887, a line from Sunshine to Newport was opened, to allow easier access to the port of Williamstown for trains from the north of Victoria. A number of sidings were also provided in the Newport area: to a flour mill on the Melbourne side, and a goods yard on the western side of the Williamstown line.

In October 1960, the Melbourne Road level crossing, which was just south of the station, was grade separated and replaced with the current road overpass. In 1966, the stabling sidings to the north of the station were provided. On 22 July 1967, a freight line was constructed to the west of Platform 1, so that freight services could bypass the station itself. In 1995, that line was converted to dual gauge, and became part of the Western standard gauge line to Adelaide.

On 18 July 1996, Newport was upgraded to a premium station.

There have been several calls to build a Melbourne Metro 2 line, once the Melbourne Metro Rail Tunnel has been completed. Melbourne Metro 2 would run from Newport to Clifton Hill via Southern Cross. The project, designed to serve the Fishermans Bend development, as well as add capacity to the Mernda and Werribee lines, would bring considerable change to Newport, perhaps adding underground platforms. There have also been suggestions to route Geelong line services via Newport into Southern Cross once again, given the crowding at Wyndham Vale and Tarneit, as well as the lack of capacity on the Regional Rail Link set of tracks between Sunshine and the city.

Announced as part of a $57.7 million package in the 2022/23 Victorian State Budget, Newport, along with other stations, will receive DDA-compliant accessibility upgrades. The work was to begin in late 2022, with a timeline for the project to be released once construction began.

On the Altona loop line, Mobiltown station, now closed and demolished, was located between Newport and Seaholme. On the direct route to Werribee, Paisley station now closed, and Galvin station, closed and demolished, were situated between Newport and Laverton.

==Platforms and services==
Newport has two side platforms. Platform 1 features a large brick building which houses an enclosed waiting area and toilets. Platform 2 has a smaller brick building which also contains toilets.

It is served by Werribee and Williamstown line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Werribee; all stations services to Laverton via Altona (weekdays only)
* all stations services to Williamstown

Until the opening of the Regional Rail Link in June 2015, Geelong and Warrnambool line services stopped at Newport.

==Transport links==
Transit Systems Victoria operates four bus routes via Newport station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : to Yarraville station
* : Williamstown – Sunshine station
* : Williamstown – Moonee Ponds Junction
* Night Bus : to Footscray station (Saturday and Sunday mornings only)

<text>Seaholme railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of the same name, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Seaholme station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 26 January 1920.

==History==
Seaholme station opened on what was then a branch line to Altona Beach. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a housing estate that was opened up in the early 1920s.

In 1954, flashing light signals were provided at the Millers Road level crossing, located at the down end of the station, with boom barriers provided in 1985. In 2020, the boom barriers were replaced with a new mechanical system and repainted into the current red and white scheme.

During the 2016/2017 financial year, Seaholme was the fifth-least-used station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 103,446 passenger movements recorded.

There used to be two stations, Mobiltown and Williamstown Racecourse, between Seaholme and Newport, but they are now closed and demolished.

==Platforms and services==
Seaholme has one platform. It is served by Werribee line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston; all stations services to Laverton (weekdays only) and Werribee

<text>Altona railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-western suburb of the same name, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Altona station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 December 1917.

Initially opened as Altona Beach, the station was given its current name of Altona on 3 October 1938.

== History ==
Altona station was originally opened as the terminus of the line from Newport. In 1888, the Altona Bay Estate Company, a private land developer, constructed a railway to Altona. The first official trains ran on the line on 8 September of that year. In 9 November 1888, the line was extended to a station named &quot;Altona Beach&quot;, which was about a kilometre to the west of the current station.

As a result of the collapse of the 1880s Land Boom, regular services to Altona Beach ceased after August 1890, and the Victorian Government declined the offer of the owners to gift it the line. In the 1890s, a company opened a brown coal mine near the terminus of the line and, in 1907, a siding was built in the same area to enable sand to be dispatched by rail. In 1910, the Altona Brown Coal Colliery Company began railing quantities of brown coal, using a short north-west extension of the Altona line.

In 1917, the owners of the railway entered into an agreement with the Victorian Railways (VR) to provide a regular passenger service, having guaranteed to cover any operating losses. On 1 December 1917, the VR opened a new &quot;Altona Beach&quot; station at the present site. For a period of time, de-motored McKeen railmotors were used as carriages on steam-hauled passenger services.

By 1924, the private owner of the Altona line owed the VR £7,289, being the accumulated deficit on operating passenger services, so the VR took full control of the line on 1 October of that year. In 1926, the track was electrified and, in 1938, the station was renamed &quot;Altona&quot;. Apart from a few direct trains between Altona and Melbourne in peak periods, all trains were run as shuttle services between Newport and Altona.

On 31 July 1959, the station was closed to goods traffic and, in 1967, flashing light signals were provided at the Pier Street level crossing, at the up end of the station. In 1977, the platform was extended at the down end.

By the early 1980s, the station, and the line itself, was under threat of closure, as recommended in the Lonie Report. In October 1981, the rail service was drastically cut, with all shuttle services withdrawn, and only two morning and evening trains being operated to and from Melbourne. However, a change of state government in 1982 saw the restitution of most services in July of that year.

On 21 January 1985, the line was extended to Westona and, on 14 April of that year, it was further extended, from Westona to Laverton. Also in that year, boom barriers were provided at the Pier Street level crossing.

== Platforms and services ==
Altona has one platform and is served by Werribee line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street and Frankston; all stations services to Laverton (weekdays only) and Werribee

<text>Westona railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Altona, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Westona station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 21 January 1985.

Westona is a crossing loop in the middle of a 10-kilometre-long section of single track between Altona Junction and Laverton. The direction in which trains cross at Westona is unusual for Melbourne, in that they pass each other on the right, rather than passing on the more common left.

== History ==
In 1965, the Victorian Parliament passed the &quot;Altona Railway Extension Act&quot;, which authorised a extension of the Altona railway, west to Maidstone Street. Despite a sign being erected on the future site of Westona station, proclaiming that a railway was to be built to there, nothing was done for almost two decades.

Westona station opened on 21 January 1985, when the railway line from Altona was extended. After opening, the station was briefly the terminus of the line, with the up face of the island platform (Platform 1) only in use. On 14 April of that year, the track to Laverton was opened. The station was named by Joanna O&#x27;Connor, Alan Angus and Betty Angus, who won a council-run contest to find a name. Because the new station was west of Altona, they suggested Westona.

In 1986, control of all signals and points was transferred to the Newport signal box, with the signal control panel moved to the relay room for maintenance purposes only.

== Platforms and services ==
Westona has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Werribee line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Laverton (weekdays only); all stations services to Werribee

<text>Laverton railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Laverton in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Laverton station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 July 1886, with the current station provided in 2010.

At the up end of the station, the tracks diverge. Werribee-bound services take the direct double track route to Newport, while all-stations Altona services operate on the single track Altona loop line to Newport. The loop line reconnects with the direct route just after the demolished station Mobiltown.

The Western standard gauge line passes to the north of Platform 1.

== History ==
Laverton station opened on 1 July 1886, like the suburb itself, was named after the pastoral run &quot;Laverton&quot;, which was settled by Alfred Langhorne in 1836.

In 1968, the former side platform was converted to an island platform, as part of the duplication of the line to Werribee. In 1969, the station building on the island platform (Platforms 2 and 3) was provided.

At about 7:55pm on 12 July 1976, a derailment occurred at the up end of the station, involving a Port Fairy – Melbourne passenger service. After crossing from the east line to the west line, the train derailed and sideswiped the Princes Highway overpass, destroying a number of wood-bodied carriages. There was one fatality in the derailment, and a number of other passengers were injured. It was later revealed that the train diverged through a crossover at excessive speed.

In 1986, the control of all signals and points was transferred to the Newport signal box, although the signal control panel remained within the station building until 2009.

On 1 October 1987, two Hitachi suburban trains collided at the up end of the station, near Laverton Junction, after an up train over ran the Altona loop line and collided with a down train.

In 1998, Laverton was upgraded to a premium station.

In May 2008, the Victorian State Government announced, as part of the 2008/2009 State Budget, that Laverton would receive a $92.6 million upgrade, which would include the building of a third platform. The work included the tripling of one kilometre of existing double track, between the Altona loop line and the station. In October 2009, the first section of the footbridge was installed and, on 9 February 2010, the completed bridge was opened to the public. The remainder of these works were completed in mid-2010.

Until June 2015, Geelong and Warrnambool line services passed through the station, but those services now use the Regional Rail Link route via Sunshine, Tarneit and Wyndham Vale.

As part of stage 1 of the Western Rail Plan Geelong Fast Rail project, Laverton is scheduled to be upgraded.

On the express route between Laverton and Newport stations, former station Galvin has been closed and demolished, and former station Paisley has been closed, and has had its platform access and station building removed.

<text>Aircraft railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Laverton, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Aircraft station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 7 March 1925, with the current station provided in 1964.

Initially opened as Aviation Siding, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Aircraft Siding on 10 May 1927 then was given its current name of Aircraft on 19 March 1963.

The Western standard gauge line passes to the north of platform 1.

==History==
Aircraft station opened on 7 March 1926, being provided to serve the former Royal Australian Air Force Laverton base. In the following year, on 10 May 1927, a platform was provided. On 10 May 1932, the station was relocated in the up direction.

In 1964, the station was rebuilt when it was relocated in the down direction, just beyond the former Aviation Road level crossing. In that year, flashing light signals were provided at the level crossing and, in 1968, in conjunction with the duplication of the railway line to Werribee, Aircraft was converted to an island platform. In 1979, boom barriers were provided at the level crossing.

Doubt was cast on the future of the station after the announcement that Williams Landing would be built just a kilometre down the line. In June 2010, a spokesman for then Public Transport Minister, Martin Pakula, said only that Aircraft would remain open until 2012, the opening date of Williams Landing. At the same time, the construction of 100 new car-parking spaces was cancelled, and railway sources confirmed that the government&#x27;s plans were to close Aircraft. However, in September 2010, the Public Transport Minister ended speculation by pledging that the station would not be closed.

In March 2018, it was announced by the Level Crossing Removal Project that the level crossing would be grade separated with a road-over-rail bridge, and the entrance of the station would be reconstructed. In September 2019, the level crossing was abolished.

In March 2022, a new pedestrian underpass opened at the up end of the station, replacing a pedestrian crossing. In April of that year, a new car-park opened to the south of the station.

==Platforms and services==
Aircraft has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Werribee line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Werribee

==Transport links==
CDC Melbourne operates three bus routes via Aircraft station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Laverton station – Williamstown
* : Laverton station – Laverton station (loop service via Laverton North)
* : Laverton station – Sanctuary Lakes (Point Cook)

<text>Hoppers Crossing railway station is a commuter railway station on the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Hoppers Crossing, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Hoppers Crossing station is a ground level host station, featuring an island platform, it opened on 16 November 1970, with the current platforms provided in 1983 and the footbridge in 2022.

The Western standard gauge line, which operates between Melbourne and Adelaide, passes to the north of Platform 1.

==History==
The station&#x27;s name matches that of the locality on which the suburb was built. Elizabeth Hopper was a gatekeeper, closing and re-opening a set of large timber level crossing gates whenever a train passed through. She and her husband, Stephen Hopper (1832-1908), a railway ganger, lived nearby with their eleven children.

The original station was located on the down (Werribee) side of the former Old Geelong Road level crossing. Problems with stationary trains blocking the level crossing led to the station being relocated to the up (Flinders Street) side of the crossing in July 1983, in conjunction with the electrification of the line to Werribee. Also in that year, boom barriers were provided at the former level crossing.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Hoppers Crossing to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

The crossing was removed as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, and was replaced with a road overpass 800m to the east of the crossing, directly connecting Old Geelong Road with the Princes Highway. Construction began in February 2021 and, on 9 December of that year, the new road bridge opened to traffic. The level crossing was closed to road traffic on the same day, and was replaced with a pedestrian overpass, which opened in February 2022.

==Platforms and services==
Hoppers Crossing has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Werribee line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:

<text>Werribee railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Werribee line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the western suburb of Werribee, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Werribee station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 25 June 1857, with the current station provided in 1983.

The Western standard gauge line, which operates between Melbourne and Adelaide, passes to the north of Platform 1.

==History==

Werribee station opened on 25 June 1857 by the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company, as part of the railway line between those two cities. It was designed by Frederick Kawerau, in partnership with Edward Snell, the engineer for the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company. In May 1927, the station building was heavily damaged by fire. As part of the rebuilding, a new, low-pitched roof was provided, and the surviving bluestone walls were cement rendered. A stone plaque, embossed with &quot;G.&amp;M.R. 1857&quot;, was once located on the south gable, but was lost after the fire. It has since been found, and has been built into the wall of the former Victorian Railways printing works in Laurens Street, North Melbourne.

In 1963, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Cherry Street level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station. In 1968, the line between Werribee and Laverton was duplicated, with duplication to Little River occurring in 1970.

In 1973, all interlocking at the station was abolished, with a signal panel provided. In 1976, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Werribee Street level crossing, which was located nearby in the down direction of the station. On 11 October 1979, a Seymour-Geelong goods train derailed at the station, causing extensive damage to both platforms and the station building on Platform 2 (now Platform 3).

In April 1983, the current island platform and underpass was provided. In November of that year, the line from Newport to Werribee was electrified. In 1987, sidings &quot;B&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; were abolished.

In 1997, Werribee was upgraded to a premium station.

On 27 June 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Cherry Street level crossing will be grade separated, with a road overpass built approximately east of the station, connecting Tarneit Road with the Princes Highway. Construction began in February 2020 and, on 11 March 2021, the overpass was opened to traffic. The Cherry Street level crossing was closed to traffic on the same day, and was replaced with a pedestrian and cyclist underpass, which opened on 1 April of that year.

As part of stage 1 of the Western Rail Plan&#x27;s Geelong Fast Rail project, Werribee is scheduled to be upgraded. Construction is set to begin in 2023.

==Platforms and services==

Werribee has one side platform and one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Werribee line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Platform 3:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street and Frankston

Until June 2015, V/Line Geelong and Warrnambool line services operated via Werribee, with many of the services stopping at the station. The Melbourne-bound services used Platform 2, while Geelong-bound services used Platform 3. These services now operate via the Regional Rail Link.

<doc id="708102" wikidata="Q1197711" url="?curid=708102" title="Sha Wujing">
<text>Sha Wujing () is one of the three disciples of the Buddhist pilgrim Tang Sanzang in the 16th century novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; written by Wu Cheng&#x27;en in the Ming dynasty, although versions of his character predate the Ming novel. In the source novel, his background is the least developed of the pilgrims, and he contributes the least to their efforts.

==Names==
In English renditions of the story, the character is called &quot;Friar Sand&quot;, &quot;Sand Monk&quot;, or just &quot;Sandy.&quot; 

His Buddhist Dharma name, &quot;Sha Wujing&quot;, given to him by the bodhisattva Guanyin, means &quot;sand aware of purity&quot;. His name is rendered in Korean as &quot;Sa Oh Jeong&quot;, into Japanese as &quot;Sa Gojō&quot;, into Sino-Vietnamese as &quot;Sa Ngộ Tịnh&quot;. 

He is also known as &quot;Monk Sha&quot; (; Sa Tăng in Sino-Vietnamese; &quot;Sua Cheng&quot; in Thai) or Sha Heshang (沙 colloquial Chinese), both basically translating as &quot;Sand Monk&quot; or &quot;Sand Priest&quot;.

==Overview==
Like Zhu Bajie, Wujing was originally a general in Heaven, more specifically a Curtain-Lifting General (卷帘大将 &quot;juǎnlián dàjiàng&quot;). His fall from grace happens when he broke a valuable Jade or Crystal vase or goblet, during a Heavenly Peach Festival; some sources say that he had done this in a fit of rage while other sources say that he had done this unintentionally, and it was an accident. Either way, he was punished by the Jade Emperor, who had him struck 800 times with a rod and exiled to earth, where he was to be reincarnated as a terrible man-eating sandman, orc, ogre, troll, oni, demon, monster, or hulk. There, he lived in the &quot;Liúshā-hé&quot; (流沙河, &quot;flowing-sand river&quot;, or &quot;quicksand-river&quot;). Each day, seven flying swords sent from Heaven would stab him in the chest and then return. He had to live in the river full-time to avoid the punishment.
Wujing&#x27;s appearance was grisly. He had a red beard and sometimes had blue skin, and he was partially bald. He was sometimes much bigger and stronger than an average human being. He still carried the weapon he had in Heaven, a magic wooden staff (made from a species of evergreen tree that grew on the moon, holds within it a solid-gold core and the outside is decorated with &quot;countless pearly-threads&quot;), which is named &quot;Xiangyaobaozhang&quot; (降妖寶杖, lit. &quot;Monster-subduing Precious Rod&quot;), created for him by Lu Ban (often depicted in artwork as a Monk&#x27;s spade). Like Sun Wukong&#x27;s Ruyi Jingu Bang, Wujing&#x27;s &quot;Xiangyaobaozhang&quot; is capable of growing, shrinking, lengthening and shortening at will. A necklace consisting of skulls made him look even more terrible; according to one story, an earlier group of nine monks on a pilgrimage west to fetch the scriptures met their end at the hands of Wujing. Heedless of their pleas for mercy, he devoured them, sucked the marrow from their bones, and threw their skulls into the river. Unlike his other victims, whose bone sank to the river bottom, these skulls of the nine monks floated. This fascinated and delighted Wujing, who strung them on a rope and played with them when he was bored.

Later, Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion, and her disciple, Prince Moksha, came searching for powerful bodyguards in preparation of Tang Sanzang&#x27;s journey west. She recruited Wujing, in exchange for which, she granted some respite from his suffering. She then converted him to Buddhism and gave him his Dharma name, &quot;Shā Wùjìng&quot; (沙悟淨); his surname &quot;Shā&quot; (&quot;Sand&quot;) was taken from his river home, while his given name &quot;Wùjìng&quot; means &quot;Awakened-to/Aware-of Purity&quot;. Finally, he was instructed to wait for a monk who would call for him. When Wujing does meet Tang Sanzang, he is mistaken for an enemy and attacked by Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie. Guanyin is forced to intervene for the sake of the journey.

After the misunderstanding was cleared up, Wujing became the third disciple of Tang Sanzang, who called him &quot;Shā-héshàng&quot; (, i.e. the &quot;sand priest&quot;; a &quot;héshàng&quot; is a Buddhist monk or priest in charge of a temple; in Japanese, &quot;oshō&quot;). Now, he was clad in a Buddhist pilgrim&#x27;s robe. During the Journey to the West, his swimming ability was useful. He always carried a small gourd which he could turn into a huge one, in order to cross rivers. Wujing was a kind-hearted and obedient person and loyal to his master, and, compared to his fellow disciples, Wujing serves as a &#x27;Straight man&#x27; character. Amongst the trio, he was likely the most polite and the most logical. Some adaptations portray him as also being bookish and philosophical. At the journey&#x27;s end, Buddha transformed him into an arhat known as the &quot;Golden-bodied Arhat&quot; ().

As the third disciple, even though his fighting skills are not as great as that of Wukong or Bajie, he is still a great warrior protecting Tang Sanzang and can use his intellect as well as his strength to beat the enemy. He knows only 18 forms of transformation (one-quarter of the full 72 that Wukong knows, and one-half of Bajie&#x27;s 36) and, in the middle of the story, admits as much.

==Historical origins==
Sha Wujing is the end result of embellishing a supernatural figure mentioned in Monk Hui Li&#x27;s () 7th-century account of the historical Xuanzang called &quot;Daciensi Sanzang Fashi Zhuan&quot; (, &quot;A Biography of the Tripitaka-master of the Great Ci&#x27;en Monastery&quot;). According to the text, Xuanzang spilled his surplus of water while in the deserts near Dunhuang. After several days without liquid, Xuanzang had a dream where a tall spirit wielding a &quot;ji&quot; (halberd) chastised him for sleeping on such an important journey to get scriptures from India. He immediately woke up and got on his horse, which took off in a different direction than what he wanted to go. They finally came to an oasis with green grass and fresh water.

The &quot;Tang Sanzang ji&quot; (唐三藏记, Record of the Tang Monk Tripitaka), a book of unknown date appearing in an 11th-century Japanese collection of tales known as &quot;Jōbodai shū&quot; (成菩堤集), states Xuanzang (Tang Sanzang) was magically provided food and drink by a Deva while in the &quot;Flowing Sands&quot; (&quot;liusha&quot;, 流沙) desert. The compiler of the &quot;Jōbodai shū&quot; explained: &quot;This is the reason for the name Spirit of the Deep Sands (&quot;Shensha shen&quot;, 深沙神).&quot; After performing a pilgrimage to China in 838–839, the Japanese Buddhist monk &quot;Jōgyō&quot; (常晓) wrote a report which mentions Xuanzang&#x27;s fabled exchange with the deity, as well as equates &quot;Shensha shen&quot; with King Vaiśravaṇa, one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism. Therefore, the &quot;Tang Sanzang ji&quot; most likely hails from the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The &quot;Jōbodai shū&quot; also mentions the god manifested itself before the famous Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian (c. 4th century) during his pilgrimage to India. &quot;Shensha shen&quot; tells him: &quot;I am manifested in an aspect of fury. My head is like a crimson bowl. My two hands are like the nets of heaven and earth. From my neck hang the heads of seven demons. About my limbs are eight serpents, and two demon heads seem to engulf my (nether-) limbs…&quot;
By the compiling of the &quot;&quot;Kōzanji&quot; version&quot; (高山记, 13th century), the earliest known edition of &quot;Journey to the West,&quot; &quot;Shensha shen&quot; was transformed into a blood thirsty demon who had continuously eaten Tang Sanzang&#x27;s past reincarnations. The demon tells him: &quot;Slung here from my neck are the dry bones from when I twice before devoured you, monk!&quot; &quot;Shensha Shen&quot; only helps him to pass over the deep sands with the aid of a magic golden bridge after Tang Sanzang threatens him with heavenly retribution.

As can be seen, the complete version of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; anonymously published in 1592 borrowed liberally from tales concerning &quot;Shensha shen&quot;. The character of Sha Wujing was given his monstrous appearance and dress. The skulls of the nine Buddhist monks hanging from his head recalls both the demon skulls worn by the spirit, and the skulls of Tang Sanzang&#x27;s past incarnations worn by his wrathful counterpart from the &quot;Kōzanji&quot; version. His home of the &quot;Flowing Sands River&quot; (&quot;Liusha he&quot; 流沙河) is derived from the &quot;Flowing Sands&quot; desert inhabited by &quot;Shensha shen&quot;. Sha Wujing also aids Tang Sanzang pass over the Flowing Sands River by tying his nine skulls into a makeshift raft.

<text>Jolimont railway station is a commuter railway station on the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the inner-eastern suburb of East Melbourne, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Jolimont station is a ground-level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 21 October 1901.

Jolimont is one of two stations that are close to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), the other being Richmond. During events at the MCG, extra exit gates are open to reduce crowding.

==History==

Jolimont station opened on 21 October 1901, when a direct railway line was provided between Princes Bridge and Collingwood. Like the locality itself, the station was named after the French words &#x27;joli mont&#x27;, which translates to &#x27;pretty mount&#x27; in English. The name was believed to have been given by the French-Swiss wife of Charles Joseph La Trobe, Victoria&#x27;s first Governor.

The original timber station building was manufactured in England in 1899. In the late 1920s, it was sold and re-erected in Canberra, on the site of the present Jolimont Centre. After being damaged by fire, it was demolished in 1977.

In 1973, additional entrances and exits were provided. In 1985, the station was renamed Jolimont MCG, and at the time it was noted that it was unique in that no advertising was permitted on the station site, according to the construction finance contract.

In November 2015, extra shelter and seats were provided on both platforms.

==Platforms and services==

Jolimont has two side platforms. It is served by Mernda and Hurstbridge line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Flinders Street

<doc id="708112" wikidata="Q8040272" url="?curid=708112" title="Wynyard railway station, Sydney">
<text>Wynyard railway station () is a heritage-listed underground commuter rail station located in the north-west precinct of the Sydney central business district, in New South Wales, Australia. The station opened on 28 February 1932 to coincide with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

==History==

The station opened on 28 February 1932. Wynyard was originally constructed with six platforms (the existing four platforms are still numbered from 3 to 6), with platforms 1-4 located on the upper level and platforms 5 and 6 on the lower level. The original intention was that Platforms 1 and 2, located adjacent to platforms 3 and 4, would eventually serve the eastern pair of railway tracks across the Harbour Bridge for a proposed railway line to the Northern Beaches. In the interim, with construction yet to begin on the Northern Beaches line due to lack of funds, they were used as a terminus for North Shore tram services on Sydney&#x27;s tram network, operating from the bridge&#x27;s opening in 1932 until 1958. A feature of these lines was Australia&#x27;s only underground tram terminus. On 22 January 1956, the lines from platforms 5 and 6 were extended to Circular Quay as part of the City Circle.

In 1999, along with Town Hall, the station received an easy access upgrade which included lifts to each island platform. The station was extensively refurbished in 2016, with Wynyard Walk, a pedestrian-only tunnel, being officially opened on 20 November 2016.

===Former tram tunnels===
Following the closure of the North Shore tram lines, in 1958 the tracks were lifted from platforms 1 and 2. Later, the platforms were walled off from 3 and 4 and part of the space converted into an underground car park for the Menzies Hotel. The tunnels were accessed from Wynyard Lane where a descending ramp was cut west under Wynyard Park to the disused platforms. The Wynyard Lane Car Park was closed in October 2016 to make way for the mixed-use Wynyard Place development which would obstruct the entrance ramp to the tunnels.

The remainder of the tunnels north of the car park exit were walled off as were the northern portals on the Harbour Bridge. North of the portals, two additional road lanes were built above the old tramway as part of the Cahill Expressway. The disused tunnels and ramp that formerly connected the station to the eastern tram tracks can still be seen from the pedestrian path along the east side of the bridge, mirroring those still in use to the west of the bridge.

==Station configuration==
Wynyard station currently has two levels, each with two platforms. The upper level serves the North Shore line, whilst the lower level serves lines traversing the City Circle. Both lines run south under York Street from Wynyard to Town Hall. There is no connection between the rails of these two lines at Wynyard.

The passenger concourse is on an intermediate level between the upper and lower platforms. Wynyard is connected via underground passageways to several surrounding buildings and shopping arcades and is located immediately below Wynyard Park. Direct access via tunnels is possible to George, Hunter and Pitt Streets. Escalators connect the station concourse with York Street (emerging underneath Transport House) and Carrington Street (under Wynyard Park).

===Refurbishment===

Commencing in 2015, the platforms and concourse were thoroughly refurbished with new flooring and ceilings as well as an extra stairway to platforms 3 and 4 and the addition of more ticket barriers. The four wooden escalators underneath Transport House, which had been operational since the opening of the station, were replaced with modern escalators. Parts of the former escalators were repurposed into a ceiling-mounted artwork titled &#x27;Interloop&#x27;, which was installed at the York Street entrance to the station concourse. The refurbishment was completed in 2018.

===Brookfield Place===

Above Wynyard Station, Brookfield Properties has created a mixed-use scheme of offices, retail and leisure in one new block that rises out of the reconfigured transit hall of Wynyard Station. The design team of Make Architects and Architectus assembled four separate sites including the former Menzies Hotel, Thakral House, and the retained Shell House and Beneficial House, and merged them into one reinvigorated block, which has been named Brookfield Place Sydney – a name the developer reserves for their premium international developments. The George and Carrington Street entrances to Wynyard Station have been greatly expanded to allow for greater access to the railway concourse but also to the buildings above and the new retail levels at street level and below. The development provides a new, street level pedestrian route from George Street through to Carrington Street and Wynyard Park beyond.

===Wynyard Walk===

The Wynyard Walk is a pedestrian link and tunnel between Wynyard station and Barangaroo that opened in September 2016, with a Clarence Street entrance that opened in December 2016. Based on a design by architecture firm Woods Bagot, the project combined a new entrance, a pedestrian tunnel, a pedestrian bridge, and a new pedestrian plaza. Wynyard Walk provides direct access via tunnels to Clarence, Kent and Sussex streets. Wynyard Walk features a huge video screen showcasing digital art.

<doc id="708114" wikidata="Q407372" url="?curid=708114" title="Pomorie">
<text>Pomorie ( ), historically known as Anchialos (), is a town and seaside resort in southeastern Bulgaria, located on a narrow rocky peninsula in Burgas Bay on the southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.

It is situated in Burgas Province, 20,5 km away from the city of Burgas and 18 km from the Sunny Beach resort. The ultrasaline lagoon Lake Pomorie, the northernmost of the Burgas Lakes, lies in the immediate proximity. The town is the administrative centre of the eponymous Pomorie Municipality.

Pomorie is an ancient city and today is an important tourist destination. As of 2020, it had a population of 13,926. It lies at .

==Geography==

=== Topography ===
The modern city of Pomorie is located on a narrow peninsula of the same name, extending 3.5 km into the Black Sea, on the northwest coast of the Burgas Bay. From the south, east and northeast, the city is surrounded by the sea, from the north - by Lake Pomorie, and only from the west-northwest it is connected to the Pomorie field, which is part of the Burgas lowland. 

The sea coast is low, sandy, with an open horizon to the east and west, protected to the north by Stara Planina. Pomorie Bay has 18,700 sq.m. of beaches. The seabed is shallow, with a gentle slope, without reefs and cold sea currents, and is safe for swimming.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Pomorie has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). The summertime in Pomorie lasts about five months from mid-May until late September. Average temperatures during high season is . Summertime sea temperatures stay around at sunrise and go up to at dawn, averaging . Winters are milder compared with the inland part of the country, with average temperatures of and below during the night. Snow is possible in December, January, February and rarely in March; however, it can quickly melt. The highest temperature was recorded in June 2007, at and the lowest at in January 1942.

==History==

Pomorie was founded by the Ancient Greeks under the name &quot;Anchialos&quot; (), deriving from Ancient Greek &quot;anchi-&quot; (&quot;near, close to&quot;) and &quot;hals-&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;). In Latin, this was rendered as &quot;Anchialus&quot;. The Bulgars called the town &quot;Tuthom&quot;, though its more common name in Bulgarian was Анхиало, &quot;Anhialo&quot; based on the Greek name. During the Ottoman rule, the town was called &quot;Ahyolu&quot;. In 1934 the town was renamed to Pomorie, from the Bulgarian &quot;po-&quot; (in this context &quot;by, next to&quot;) and &quot;more&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;), corresponding to one of the two etymologies of the original Greek name.

===Ancient Greek colony and Roman centre===
Possibly founded in the 5th or 4th century BC as a colony of Apollonia (today Sozopol), Anchialos was mentioned in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; as a small town. It was briefly captured by Messembria (Nesebar) in the 2nd century BC, but reconquered by Apollonia and its fortified walls destroyed. 

The western Black Sea coast was ultimately conquered by the Romans under Marcus Licinius Crassus in 29-28 BC after continuous campaigns in the area since 72-71. The fortified wall was meanwhile rebuilt, as evidenced by Ovid in 9 AD en route to Tomis. In the early 1st century AD Anchialos was the centre of a &quot;strategia&quot; of the vassal Odrysian kingdom, and the town had a Thracian population in the 6th century AD according to the early Byzantine historian Procopius. As the Odrysian kingdom&#x27;s self-independence was abolished in 45 AD, Anchialos became part of the Roman province of Thrace and was formally proclaimed a city under Emperor Trajan. At the time the city controlled a vast territory bordering that of Augusta Trajana (Stara Zagora) and reaching the Tundzha to the west, bordering that of Messembria to the north and the southern shore of Lake Burgas to the south. Anchialos acquired the appearance of a Roman city and thrived in the 2nd and 3rd century under the Severan Dynasty, serving as the most important import and export station of Thrace.

===Early Byzantine rule===
However, the invasion of barbarian tribes from the north meant an end to this prosperity in the middle of the 3rd century, with the Goths briefly capturing Anchialos around 270. Diocletian stayed in the city between 28 and 30 October 294. His and Constantine the Great&#x27;s reforms restored the city&#x27;s prosperity for a while, as the proximity to the new capital of Constantinople made Anchialos a key food supply centre.

Theodoric the Great passed through the city in 476 on the way to Adrianople. A high-ranking Byzantine general named Vitalian in 513 revolted in the region and briefly took control of Anchialos and the neighbouring cities to use their fleet in his attack of Constantinople until he was crushed in 515. 

The bishopric of Anchialus was originally a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto, capital of the Roman province of Haemimontus. However, the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; of Pseudo-Epiphanius, written in the reign of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (c. 640), gives it as an autocephalous archbishopric, today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. The first bishop of the see whose name is known is 2nd-century Sotas, mentioned by Eusebius of Caesarea as an adversary of Montanism. Timotheus was at the Council of Sardica in 343/344. Sebastianus was one of the bishops at the First Council of Constantinople of 381. Sabbatius was a signatory of the decree of the Patriarch of Constantinople against simoniacs in 459. Paulus was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Jacobus was a contemporary of Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople. Nicolaus was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). No longer a residential bishopric, Anchialus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

The Slavic and Avar invasion in 584 meant Anchialos was conquered and its fortifications were destroyed. Avar Khagan Bayan turned the city into his residence for a few months and concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines. At the eve of his campaigns, the emperor Maurice visited the city to oversee reconstruction.

===Byzantine and Bulgarian rule===
After 681 and the formation of the First Bulgarian Empire to the north Anchialos played an important role in many conflicts between the two empires. In 708 the forces of Justinian II were completely defeated near the fortress by the army of Bulgar Khan Tervel. On 30 June 763 the Bulgars under Telets suffered a defeat by the Byzantine army of Constantine V. On 21 June 766 the same emperor&#x27;s fleet of 2,600 heavy ships sank en route to Anchialos, where Constantine was waiting, and most soldiers drowned, forcing him to return to Constantinople.

In May 783 Irene undertook a demonstrative campaign across Thrace and restored Anchialos&#x27; destroyed fortifications. The city was first conquered by the Bulgarian Empire in 812, under Khan Krum, who settled Slavs and Bulgars in Anchialos. The Byzantines restored their control over the city and the area in 864.

The Battle of Anchialus took place near the city on 20 August 917, and was one of Tsar Simeon the Great&#x27;s greatest military achievements. Simeon&#x27;s army routed the considerably larger Byzantine forces under Leo Phocas. Bulgaria retained the city until 971, when the Byzantine Empire reconquered it and held it for two centuries as Bulgaria was subjugated. After the restoration of the Bulgarian state Anchialos changed hands several times until it was captured by the Venetian knights of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in October 1366. The next year it was ceded to Byzantium.

===Ottoman rule===
After the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans in the 14th century, Anchialos remained a Byzantine bulwark until submission in 1453 together with Constantinople. Whilst under Ottoman administration, it became the centre of a kaza also encompassing the area around Sozopol as &quot;Ahyolu&quot;. It was the centre of an eparchy of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and continued to act as a cultural, religious, economic and administrative centre of the region until the early 19th century, as many noble Byzantine families settled after 1453. Two Patriarchs of Constantinople stem from the city—Michael III of Anchialus (1170–1178) and Jeremias II Tranos (1572–1579, 1580–1584, 1587–1595).

Already before 1819 many prominent locals joined the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Eteria. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) a part of the town&#x27;s representatives, priests as well as the Orthodox bishop Eugenios were executed by the Ottoman authorities. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 Anchialos was captured by the Russian forces on 11 July 1829 and held for a year. At the time it was mainly inhabited by Greeks, with minorities of Bulgarians and Turks, had a population of 5,000-6,000, six Orthodox churches and a mosque. After the Russian forces withdrew the whole of what is today Eastern Bulgaria gradually depopulated, with many people fleeing to the Christian lands to the north. Pomorie&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Monastery was founded in 1856. It was a kaza centre in İslimye sanjak of Edirne Province before 1878 as &quot;Ahyolu&quot;.

===Part of Bulgaria===
Anchialos was liberated from Ottoman rule on 27 January 1878 and became part of Eastern Rumelia as a kaza centre in Burgaz sanjak until Bulgaria unified in 1885. At the turn of the 20th century Anchialos was a town of about 6,000 inhabitants of which 82% were Greeks. Pomorie was one of the predominantly Greek-inhabited towns in Bulgaria that were affected by anti-Greek pogroms in early 1900s. The local Greek community was already targeted by the Bulgarian authorities from early 1905. The town was burnt down in July, 1906, and over 300 Greeks were murdered. The perpetrators were Bulgarian refugees from the region of Macedonia as a response to the massacre of the Bulgarian inhabitants of the village of Zagorichani by Greek militants. In addition to political reasons there were also economic motives. The Bulgarian authorities were accused by most European governments due to this turn of events. The destruction of the town was compared by contemporary European diplomacy to the anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia.

The town accommodated many Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace, mainly from around Lozengrad after World War I, who replaced the Greeks who had fled in the first decade of the 20th century; in 1906 they founded Nea Anchialos in Greece. During the 19th and 20th century it gradually lost most of its importance in the southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast at the expense of rapidly developing Burgas. It established itself as a centre of wine and salt production and was renamed &quot;Pomorie&quot; in 1934/1935.

<doc id="708116" wikidata="Q7821745" url="?curid=708116" title="Tony Adams (actor)">
<text>Anthony Stephen Adams (born 11 December 1940) is a Welsh actor of English and Norwegian descent, known for his performances in two British television soap operas.

==Early life==
Adams was born on 11 December 1940 in Anglesey, Wales, to Winifred Brown, a sportswoman and aviator. In 1930, she had been the first woman to win the King&#x27;s Cup Air Race around England.

Adams trained as an actor at the Italia Conti Stage School. As a child he appeared on the London stage, notably alongside the young Kenneth Williams in a production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Scala Theatre. Other stage appearances included a starring role opposite Cheryl Kennedy in a West End revival of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, and he also appeared on the original cast album released with this production. He also appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and in pantomime with David Essex.

==Career==
Adams made his name as Dr Neville Bywaters in the 1970s soap &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He also appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Green Death&quot; (1973) as Elgin. However, he became ill with peritonitis during filming, and some of his lines were given to another character.

In November 1978 he moved on to a role in &quot;Crossroads&quot;, as accountant Adam Chance, who soon became a major character. It is for this role that he is best known. In September 1987, Adams decided to leave the programme. The announcement was made that the series would end in April 1988, and Adams stayed to the end. He was one of the cast members who returned in the 2001 revival of the series, though his character was later killed off in a fire. He also appeared in a one-off DVD made in 2014.

In late 2004, Adams appeared in the stage version of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the London Palladium theatre where he played Grandpa Potts.

In 2023, Adams appeared in a cameo role in the ITVX miniseries &quot;Nolly&quot;, which dramatised the life of his former &quot;Crossroads&quot; colleague Noele Gordon, and in which Adams himself was portrayed by Augustus Prew.

==Personal life==
In 2013, aged 72, Adams began suffering from osteoarthritis, which he speculated might have resulted from eating an excess of seafood, especially prawns.

<doc id="708120" wikidata="Q375786" url="?curid=708120" title="Hippolytus (play)">
<text>Hippolytus (, &quot;Hippolytos&quot;) is an Ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides, based on the myth of Hippolytus, son of Theseus. The play was first produced for the City Dionysia of Athens in 428 BC and won first prize as part of a trilogy. The text is extant.

Euripides first treated the myth in a previous play, &quot;Hippolytos Kalyptomenos&quot; ( – &quot;Hippolytus Veiled&quot;), which is lost, and survives only in fragments. What is known of it is based on echoes found in other ancient writings. The earlier play, and the one that has survived are both titled &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, but in order to distinguish the two they have traditionally been given the names, &quot;Hippolytus Kalyptomenos&quot; and &quot;Hippolytus Stephanophoros&quot; ( – &quot;Hippolytus the wreath bearer&quot;).

It is thought that the contents to the lost &quot;Hippolytos Kalyptomenos&quot; portrayed a woman, Phaedra, reduced to shamelessness by a god, and not given the dignity of being able to resist the spell that Aphrodite has placed on her. Athenians may have been offended by a determinedly lustful heroine of a tragedy offering herself directly to Hippolytus. Such a weakness in Phaedra’s character, may have caused Hippolytus’ desire for purity to be less effectively portrayed. In 428 B.C., Euripides offered to the festival of Dionysus a second version of the story, in which Phaedra resists Aphrodite as best she can. This is the version that has survived.

Euripides revisits the myth in &quot;Hippolytos Stephanophoros&quot;, its title refers to the garlands Hippolytus wears as a worshipper of Artemis. In this version Phaedra fights against her own sexual desires, which have been incited by Aphrodite.
==Synopsis==

The play is set in Troezen, a coastal town in the north-eastern Peloponnese. Theseus, the king of Athens, is serving a year&#x27;s voluntary exile after having murdered a local king and his sons. His illegitimate son is Hippolytus, whose birth is the result of Theseus&#x27;s rape of the Amazon Hippolyta. Hippolytus has been trained since childhood by the king of Troezen, Pittheus. Hippolytus has a step-mother, Phaedra, who lives in Athens.

At the opening of the play Aphrodite, Goddess of love, explains that Hippolytus has sworn chastity and refuses to revere her. Instead, he honours the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis. This has led Aphrodite to initiate a plan of vengeance on Hippolytus. When Hippolytus went to Athens two years previously Aphrodite caused Phaedra to fall in love with him.

Hippolytus appears with his followers and shows reverence to a statue of Artemis, a chaste goddess. A servant warns him about slighting Aphrodite, but Hippolytus refuses to listen.

The chorus, consisting of young married women of Troezen, enters and describes how Theseus&#x27;s wife, Phaedra, has not eaten or slept in three days. Phaedra, sickly, appears with her nurse. After an agonizing discussion, Phaedra finally confesses why she is ill: she loves Hippolytus. The nurse and the chorus are shocked. Phaedra explains that she must starve herself and die with her honour intact and to save Theseus from shame. However, the nurse quickly retracts her initial response and tells Phaedra that she has a magical charm to cure her. However, in an aside she reveals different plans.

The nurse, after making Hippolytus swear not to tell anyone, informs Hippolytus of Phaedra&#x27;s desire and suggests that Hippolytus consider yielding to her. He reacts with a furious tirade and threatens to tell his father, Theseus, everything as soon as he arrives. Phaedra realizes disaster has fallen. After making the chorus swear secrecy, she goes inside and hangs herself.

Theseus returns and discovers his wife&#x27;s dead body. Because the chorus is sworn to secrecy, they cannot tell Theseus why she killed herself. Theseus discovers a letter on Phaedra&#x27;s body, which falsely asserts that she was raped by Hippolytus. Enraged, Theseus curses his son either to death or at least exile. To execute the curse, Theseus calls upon his father, the god Poseidon, who has promised to grant his son three wishes. Hippolytus enters and protests his innocence but cannot tell the truth because of the binding oath that he swore. Taking Phaedra&#x27;s letter as proof, Hippolytus proudly defends his innocence, saying that he has never looked at any woman with sexual desire. Theseus does not believe his son and still exiles him. As Hippolytus is departing he swears that if he is lying then Zeus should strike him down on the spot. 

The chorus sings a lament for Hippolytus.

A messenger enters and describes a gruesome scene to Theseus; as Hippolytus got in his chariot to leave the kingdom, a bull roared out of the sea, frightening his horses, which dashed his chariot among the rocks, dragging Hippolytus behind. Hippolytus seems to be dying. The messenger protests Hippolytus&#x27; innocence, but Theseus refuses to believe him.

Theseus is glad that Hippolytus is suffering and about to die. But then the goddess, Artemis, appears and rages at Theseus for killing his own son. She brutally tells him the truth and that Aphrodite was behind all their suffering, because she felt disrespected by Hippolytus&#x27;s pride in his chastity. Artemis states that there was no rape, Phaedra had lied, and Theseus&#x27; son is innocent. Theseus is devastated by this revelation. Hippolytus is carried in physically battered and barely clinging to life. In the last moments of the play, Hippolytus forgives his father, kind words are exchanged between father and son, and then Hippolytus dies. Theseus is then left living to dwell on the fact that he killed his beloved son.

==Interpretations==

In this play, all characters, humans and gods, have blindnesses that prevent them from understanding others, and these blindnesses combine to result in tragedy. The clash between Phaedra and Hippolytus is a conflict between what is repugnant and depraved — a woman sexually desiring her step son–and what is inhuman and arrogant–a young man that finds sexuality repellant. Hippolytus is possessed by a desire for purity, which is represented by the goddess Artemis. Hippolytus describes the goddess&#x27; purifying power in terms of the ancient Greek concept of sophrosyne, which is translated in the script variously as the situation requires–&quot;wisdom, chastity, moderation, character&quot;. This play illustrates that it is not possible for a person to be sophron and also a devotee of Aphrodite.

Scholar Rachel Bruzzone argued in 2012 that Pygmalion in Book X of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; and Hippolytus share certain characteristics. The main antagonist of both stories is Aphrodite, who seeks revenge on both for insulting her by remaining virgins. They are also both obsessed with remaining pure. Both are misogynistic with Hippolytus believing that women are morally corrupt and will ruin his pureness. Pygmalion believes the same in that women are just lust-filled creatures that will ruin his pureness. But Pygmalion unlike Hippolytus does desire a woman, just one he deems as perfect which is one that does not speak, is nameless and compliant. Both have a love affair with a statue. Hippolytus&#x27;s love affair is more subtle where he just says that his wife is a statue but Pygmalion actually marries his statue, which is brought to life.

<doc id="708147" wikidata="Q1535526" url="?curid=708147" title="Targa top">
<text>Targa top, or targa for short, is a semi-convertible car body style with a removable roof section and a full-width roll bar behind the seats. The term was first used on the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa, and it remains a registered trademark of Porsche AG.

The rear window is normally fixed, but on some targa models, it is a removable plastic foldable window, making it a convertible-type vehicle. Any piece of normally fixed metal or trim which rises up from one side, over the roof and down the other side is sometimes called a targa band, targa bar, or wrapover band.

Targa tops are different from &quot;T-tops&quot;, which have a solid, non-removable bar running between the top of the windscreen and the rear roll-bar, and generally have two separate roof panels above the seats that fit between the window and central t-bar.

== Origin ==
The word targa first came into use from the 1965 Porsche 911 Targa, though it was not the first to use the removable roof panel system. The system first appeared in 1957 on the limited-production Fiat 1200 &quot;Wonderful&quot; by Vignale, designed by Giovanni Michelotti. The later Triumph TR4 from 1961, another Michelotti design, also featured a similar system, defined by Triumph as a surrey top. The 1964 SAAB Catherina prototype and the 1965 Toyota Sports 800 both used similar systems before the 1967 Porsche 911 Targa.

The targa style roof opening became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were fears that the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the United States would ban convertibles, due to concerns over the safety of occupants when a car overturns. As a result, manufacturers adopted Targa tops or T-tops. As Porsche helped to popularise this body style, they took out a trademark for the Targa name and manufacturers sought for alternative names for their removable tops. Porsche got the name &quot;Targa&quot; from the Targa Florio, the road race in Sicily where Porsche was very successful. &quot;Targa&quot; means &quot;plate&quot; (or placard) in Italian.

Targa and T-top numbers have slowly declined as manufacturers discontinued them in favour of full convertibles with retractable hardtops and folding metal roofs such as the Mercedes-Benz SLK, and by better structural engineering with pop-up roll-over bars behind the seats and front roll-over bars incorporated into the front windscreen.

== Glass roof ==
The year 1996 saw the debut of a retractable glass roof in the Porsche 993 Targa, a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The glass roof retracted underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. A shade was there to help prevent the greenhouse effect of the closed roof. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new glass roof design allowed the 993 Targa to retain nearly the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and eliminated the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa had the body of the Cabriolet with the Targa glass roof replacing the fabric roof. The 911 Targa continued with the all-new 996-model and gained a lifting hatchback glass window. This, in turn, was used on the later 997 model of 911.

== Motorized roof ==
With the introduction and production of the latest two generations of 911, the Type 991 and 992, Porsche decided to take the Targa in a different direction from that of the previous water-cooled Type 996/997 cars. The latest Targas were introduced in 2013 and 2019, and unlike the Type 993/996/997 Targas, the newer cars have somewhat returned to their earliest Targa roots by utilizing a solid roof panel spanning over the front seats. However unlike the manual lift-out panels of earlier 911s, the Type 991 and 992 Targa&#x27;s roof panels are mechanized for automated lift-away and storage under the rear glass roof, which itself is mechanized to lift up and out of the way as the roof panel is placed into its stowed position. The Type 991 Targa also brought back the styling feature of the &#x27;Targa bar&#x27; that was perhaps the most obvious and overt design cue of the air-cooled generation Targas. But unlike the previous Targa hoops, the one used on the Type 991 is in sections, where the horizontal span member is a physically separate piece that itself is mechanized to lift off of its vertical supports in order to allow the solid roof panel and its motorized components to slide rearwards as the panel is being stored within the car.

== Rotating roof ==
Ferrari introduced a hybrid variation of the targa roof and folding metal roof with the 180 degree rotating roof featured on the 2005 Ferrari Superamerica designed by Leonardo Fioravanti, which was previewed on his Alfa Romeo Vola concept in 2000. The concept was also used in the 2010 Renault Wind.

<text>The Shamrock Summit was the colloquial name given to the March 17–18, 1985 meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and US President Ronald Reagan in Quebec City. It gained this nickname because of the Irish background of the two leaders and because the meeting started on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. The summit was capped by a televised gala, which ended with Mulroney, Reagan and their wives singing &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; at the Grand Théâtre de Québec, which publicly exemplified the camaraderie between the two leaders.

Documents later revealed that American officials saw the summit as a chance to mend relations between the two countries in the post-Pierre Trudeau era.

Among the many issues discussed in a busy 24-hour schedule were military planning, upgrading the DEW line to use modern electronics, a landmark agreement on the control of acid rain, and the formal signing of the Pacific Salmon Treaty and the &quot;Canada-US Declaration on Goods and Services&quot;, the first major step towards the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

==Background==
Mulroney enjoyed a close friendship with Reagan at the time; both men considered themselves conservatives politically, and shared a common agenda on many issues, notably free trade. This relationship bred some resentment among those who felt it was improper for Canadian-US relations to be too intimate. Canadian historian Jack Granatstein said that this &quot;public display of sucking up to Reagan may have been the single most demeaning moment in the entire political history of Canada&#x27;s relations with the United States.&quot;

<text>Heidi Hudson Leick (born May 9, 1969) is a former American actress, known for her role as villainess Callisto in the television series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Leick was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 9, 1969, and grew up in Rochester, New York.

==Career==

=== Acting ===
Leick started her career as a model in Japan, but decided to concentrate on acting. She took courses in drama and diction to improve her voice. In 1992, she appeared in one episode of the series CBS Schoolbreak Special. The following year, Leick appeared in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She played a small role as a &quot;sexpot&quot; in &quot;University Hospital&quot; as nurse Tracy Stone. In 1994, she appeared as the virtual reality designer Hannah in the television film &quot;Knight Rider 2010&quot;.

Leick&#x27;s big break came in 1995 when she won a part on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Leick appeared in ten episodes of the series. After a couple of small roles in &quot;Hijacked: Flight 285&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Cargo&quot;, the director Robert Tapert selected Leick for the role of Callisto on &quot;&quot;. Leick also portrayed Callisto on three episodes of &quot;Xena&quot; companion TV series &quot;&quot;, as well as portraying screenwriter/producer Liz Friedman in two modern-day episodes.

In 2000, Leick announced at a convention that she would not be in more episodes of &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; or &quot;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&quot; because she was being offered more and different roles, and felt that she needed to play another character besides Callisto. Beginning in 1999, she appeared in the films &quot;Chill Factor&quot;, &quot;Hallowed Ground&quot;, &quot;Blood Type&quot;, &quot;Denial&quot;, and &quot;After the Game&quot;, and had roles in the series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, and &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;. She performed in &quot;A.I. Assault&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Lords of Everquest&quot;, &quot;Tru Calling&quot; (in its pilot episode), the voice of Jen in the computer game &quot;Primal&quot;, &quot;Fastlane&quot; and &quot;Cold Heart&quot;.

In 2008, Leick finished the films &quot;One, Two, Many&quot; and &quot;Unconditional&quot;. She played the role of Coco DeVille in the Jackie Collins film, &quot;Paris Connections&quot;, which was released in 2010.

<text>Felix von Hartmann (15 December 1851 – 11 November 1919) was a German prelate, who was Archbishop of Cologne from 1912 to 1919.

== Life ==
Felix von Hartmann was born in Münster, the child of the second marriage of government official Albert von Hartmann. The family was close to the Westphalian aristocracy and served in a manner that was similar to that of traditional Prussian public servants.

After finishing his courses at Gymnasium Paulinum in Westphalia, he attended the Roman Catholic boarding school Collegium Augustinianum Gaesdonck, where Hermann Dingelstad, later Bishop of Münster, was his teacher. In 1870, he enrolled in a theological school in Westphalia, and on 19 December 1874, he was ordained a priest. Because the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture war&quot;) made employment in Germany impossible. He went to Rome, where he joined the priest college at Santa Maria dell&#x27; Anima, and became Chaplain in the church Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima, that was then the German national church in Rome. He simultaneously started his study of Canon law. In 1877, he earned the title of Dr. jur. can. (doctor of canon law) and returned to Westphalia in 1879, where he became a chaplain in the parishes of Havixbeck and Emmerich.

In 1890, he became secretary and chaplain to Dingelstad, by this time Bishop of Münster. He rose through the ranks of the Church by serving as counselor of the episcopal curia of Münich, 1895–1905; canon of the cathedral chapter of Münster, 1903–1905; vicar general of Münster, 30 October 1905 – 1911; dean of the chapter and vicar capitular, 1910; and &quot;protonotary apostolic ad instar participantium&quot;, 20 December 1907.

He was prepared, on the basis of royal nomination, to be promoted to the episcopate of Münster, where he was promoted to dean in 1911. Having a great influence on church politics because the bishop trusted him completely, he had a certain view concerning reforming Catholicism that even later he would never give up. Because his influence was well known, his election to the bishopric of Münster on 6 June 1911 surprised no one. Despite the royal government&#x27;s disapproval of his ultramontane views, it was impressed by his wise and polite ways, his excellent manners and his noble descent. His papal confirmation followed on 27 July and then his ordination as bishop by the Archbishop of Cologne, Anton Fischer, on 26 October in Münster.

On 29 October 1912, von Hartmann was selected as Archbishop of Cologne. He was enthroned on 19 April 1913. On 2 May 1914, Pope Pius X made him a Cardinal. From 1914 to his death, he was the leader of the Conference of German Bishops in Fulda.

When he arrived in Cologne at the height of the labour union strike, his main concern were the Catholic workers&#x27; organizations. In that issue, he succeeded in assuming a flexible attitude, and in 1913, he also began openly endorsing the interdenominational trade unions. He found support for his stance in Cologne and other places, but many others considered his opinion to be a stab in the back. Cardinal Kopp even tried to block his creation as Cardinal because of that.

Often and certainly accurately described as patriotic and loyal to the monarchy, those around him always saw him as a political conservative because his restraint with reference to the Centre Party was self-explanatory. In addition, he did not support the abolition of the Prussian three-class franchise, a system that weighted votes according to how much tax one paid. That was because he feared that doing so would benefit the Social Democratic Party.

He was convinced of the legitimacy of the First World War and in 1915 went to Rome personally to explain the German government&#x27;s view on the Belgian question. The risk-averse and conflict-shy Hartmann sought in that manner to escape at any price from Belgian Cardinal Mercier. 
When Mercier then asked the German episcopate to acquit the Belgian population of the accusation of partisan warfare in 1916, Hartmann could be dissuaded only with difficulty from giving a public reply, which would have involved the episcopate in nationalist polemics.

In general, Hartmann cared for the cure of souls, for prisoners of war and for mercy for many foreigners who were sentenced by German war tribunals. Therefore, he travelled to the Western Front in the summer of 1916 and continued to maintain good contacts with Kaiser Wilhelm II even after the fall of the German Empire.

In mid-September 1919, Hartmann became ill with shingles on the left side of his head, which led rapidly to the paralysis of the left half of his face. In early November he contracted pneumonia as well, which led to his death in the early morning hours of 11 November in Cologne.

Hartmann is buried in the Cathedral of Cologne.

<text>The Summa contra Gentiles is one of the best-known treatises by Thomas Aquinas, written as four books between 1259 and 1265.

Whereas the &quot;Summa Theologiæ&quot; was written to explain the Christian faith to theology students, the &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot; is more apologetic in tone. While the last book deals with topics of revealed theology such as trinity, incarnation, and the sacraments, the first three books limit themselves to natural theology: Arguments on the basis of reason, Thomas believes, will be understood also by those who do not believe in Christian revelation.

==Title==
The conventional title &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot;, found in some of the earliest manuscripts, is sometimes given in the variant &quot;Summa contra Gentes&quot;. The title is taken from chapter I.2, where Thomas states his intention as the work&#x27;s author:

I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of Hilary: &#x27;I am aware that I owe this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him&#x27; (&quot;De Trinitate&quot; I, 37).

A longer title is also given as &quot;Tractatus de fide catholica, contra errores infidelium&quot;, meaning &quot;Tractate on the universal faith, against the errors of the pagans&quot;.

==Date and composition==
The work was written over a period of several years, between 1259 and 1265.

In the spring of 1256 Thomas was appointed regent master in theology at Paris and one of his first works upon assuming this office was &quot;Contra impugnantes Dei cultum et religionem&quot;, defending the mendicant orders, which had come under attack by William of Saint-Amour. 
During his tenure from 1256 to 1259, Thomas wrote numerous works, and he was working on &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot; by the time he left Paris.
From Aquinas&#x27;s autograph, Torrell (1996) identified the first 53 chapters of Book I as having been written in Paris based on studies of the parchment and the ink used.

According to a tradition that can be traced to shortly after Thomas&#x27;s death, the &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot; was written in response to a request, made in 1259, for a book that would help the Dominican missionaries in Spain to convert the Muslims and Jews there.
The request was made by Raymond of Peñafort, a Dominican friar and advisor to James I of Aragon. Raymond had been active in the Christian defense against the Moors (Muslims) and Jews in the kingdom of Aragon since the 1240s. To this end, Raymond instituted the teaching of Arabic and Hebrew in several houses of the friars, and he also founded priories in Murcia (then still under Muslim rule) and in Tunis. Additionally he went to help establish the Church in the recently conquered island of Mallorca. Raymond&#x27;s request to Thomas was transmitted by fellow Dominican Ramón Martí, one of eight friars appointed to make a study of oriental languages with the purpose of carrying on a mission to Jews and Moors.
The historicity of this account has been questioned in modern scholarship. Arguments adduced include the lack of an explicit dedication to Raymond, the evidence that substantial portions of book 1 were complete by mid-1259 (suggesting that Thomas started work on the book as early as 1257), and the suggestion that the work makes no effort to address tenets of Islam specifically.

Later in 1259, Thomas left Paris and returned to Naples, where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to Orvieto as conventual lector responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a &quot;studium generale&quot;. It was in Orvieto that Thomas completed &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot;, which was followed by the &quot;Catena aurea&quot; and minor works produced for Pope Urban IV such as the liturgy for the newly created feast of Corpus Christi and the &quot;Contra errores graecorum&quot;.

Parts of the text have survived in Aquinas&#x27;s autograph, kept in the Vatican Library as Lat. 9850. The manuscript includes fragments of books one and two, and large portions of book three.

==Contents==
The &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot; consists of four books. The structure of St. Thomas&#x27;s work is designed to proceed from general philosophical arguments for monotheism, to which Muslims and Jews are likely to consent even within their own respective religious traditions, before progressing to the discussion of specifically Christian doctrine.

* Book I begins with general questions of truth and natural reason, and from chapter 10 investigates the concept of a monotheistic God. Chapters 10 to 13 are concerned with the existence of God, followed by a detailed investigation of God&#x27;s properties (chapters 14 to 102). When demonstrating a Truth about God which can be known through reason, St. Thomas gives multiple arguments, each proving the same Truth in a different way.
* Book II is dedicated to the Creation (viz. the physical universe, everything which exists).
* Book III discusses providence and the human condition, i.e. good and evil acts, human fate and intellect and the relation of created beings to the creator.
* Book IV is dedicated to discussing points of Christian doctrine which separate Nicaean Christianity from the other monotheistic religions, i.e. the doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Sacraments and the Resurrection.

Books I–III cover truths that naturally are accessible to the human intellect while Book IV covers revealed truths for which natural reason is inadequate.

==Editions and translations==
Giuseppe Ciantes (d. 1670), a leading Hebrew expert of his day and professor of theology and philosophy at the College of Saint Thomas in Rome, was appointed in 1640 by Pope Urban VIII to the mission of preaching to the Jews of Rome (&quot;Predicatore degli Ebrei&quot;) in order to promote their conversion. In the mid-1650s Ciantes wrote a &quot;monumental bilingual edition of the first three Parts of Thomas Aquinas’ &quot;Summa contra Gentiles&quot;, which includes the original Latin text and a Hebrew translation prepared by Ciantes, assisted by Jewish converts, the &quot;Summa divi Thomae Aquinatis ordinis praedicatorum Contra Gentiles quam Hebraicè eloquitur…&quot;. Until the present this remains the only significant translation of a major Latin scholastic work in modern Hebrew.&quot;

The first modern edition of the work is the one by Ucceli (1878) re-published in 1918 as part of the &quot;Editio Leonina&quot;. Appendices to the first three books, based on the authograph, were edited as vols. 13 (1918, 3–61) and 14 (1926, 3–49) of the Leonine edition. The Leonine text was re-edited, with corrections, by P. Marc, C. Pera and P. Carmello and published with Marietti, Torino-Rome, in 1961.
Modern translations have been published in: 
English (1924, 1957),
German (1937, 2001),
Spanish (1968) and French (1993, 1999).

<text>The International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) is the second-largest drag racing sanctioning body after the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA).

==The Carrier Era 1971-1987==
The IHRA was formed in November 1970 by businessman Larry Carrier. Throughout this period the organization was operated primarily in the south-eastern United States from its headquarters in Bristol, Tennessee. The IHRA initially followed the NHRA&#x27;s professional class structure of Top Fuel, Funny Car and Pro Stock until the 1984 season when it decided to drop the premier Top Fuel category, an arrangement that only lasted three years before the class was reinstated for the 1987 season. Carrier is also credited with initiating drag racing&#x27;s long-term sponsorship association with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company&#x27;s Winston brand, which has ended.

==1988-98==
IHRA headquarters briefly moved to Waco, Texas in 1988 after it was purchased by Texan racer and track operator Billy Meyer who made many changes to the organization, some of which proved controversial amongst racers such as completely restructuring the sportsman classes overnight. Another radical change came as a result of Meyer&#x27;s ownership of the Texas Motorplex, considered then to be the premier drag racing facility in the world. The Motorplex had previously been the NHRA&#x27;s flagship track but for 1988 it hosted two IHRA national events and was the site of Top Fuel&#x27;s first 4 second run by Eddie Hill. Other changes included the addition of a &#x27;junior&#x27; Pro Stock class for small-block and V6 engines, named Factory Modified, which lasted until the end of the 1990 season. However, financial failure meant that Meyer&#x27;s reign lasted just one year before the association was again sold on.

In 1988, the headquarters moved back to Bristol, Tennessee, under the ownership of Ted Jones and Jim Ruth.

In 1990, an all new class, Pro Modified, was introduced which has since become a feature at IHRA events and has become one of drag racing’s most successful classes enjoying popularity in both North America and Europe. During this period Pro Modified became the IHRA&#x27;s main asset in its recovery from the 1988 season that had nearly destroyed it.

However, the nitromethane powered Funny Car class was dropped for the 1991 season only to be reinstated for 1992 before being dropped again, not to return until 2006. In 2009 IHRA dropped the funny car class again due to sponsor problems caused by a deep recession in the American economy.

==Bill Bader, Clear Channel, Feld and Palm Beach==
In 1998, the organization was purchased by Bill Bader who significantly expanded the promotion in the Great Lakes from his headquarters in Norwalk, Ohio. He sold the IHRA to Clear Channel Communications, but remained as president until his retirement in October 2004. The headquarters remain in Norwalk, which was once the site of the IHRA&#x27;s flagship World Nationals event.

In 2005, Clear Channel was split into Clear Channel Radio and Live Nation, with IHRA becoming part of the latter. Feld Entertainment bought Live Nation&#x27;s motorsports division in 2008, and operated the IHRA for four years.

In 2010, the IHRA adopted the &quot;Chicago style&quot; format for professional classes, which was criticised by racers.

IHRA was purchased by Palm Beach International Raceway owners in 2013 and was renamed IHRA Motorsports. PBIR also owns and operates Memphis International Raceway since 2011. Those companies were integrated into IRG Sports + Entertainment also in 2013. IRG also eliminated the Chicago format for 2014. IRG has since sold off its race tracks, and currently only operates the sanctioning body.

IHRA became a sportsman only series with track sanctioning after 2014 with elimination of national events, leaving NHRA the only viable drag racing series for the general public.

==Outside the Continental USA==
In addition to tracks in 30 states in the continental United States, IHRA oversees tracks in Canada, Hawaii, and Aruba. Despite the &quot;international&quot; in its name the IHRA was for years based solely in the United States. However, in recent years the organization has made significant inroads north of the border. The IHRA&#x27;s first major event in Canada was a one-off in 1992 at Toronto Motorsports Park in Cayuga, Ontario but it wasn&#x27;t until later in the decade that Canadian events became the regular fixtures they are today.

The IHRA is now the premiere motorsports sanctioning body in Canada, holding three national drag racing events. One event is hosted in the province of Ontario (Grand Bend) and one in Alberta (Edmonton).

In addition to Canada, there are IHRA tracks outside the Continental USA in Hawaii (Hilo Dragstrip), Alaska (Alaska Raceway Park), and Aruba (International Raceway Park Aruba).

In 2015, the IHRA also added three Australian tracks following the split from Australian National Drag Racing Association Perth Motorplex, Willowbank Raceway, and Sydney Dragway joining as part of the IHRA-sanctioned 400 Thunder series. A few months later, Cairns&#x27; Springmount Raceway joined the IHRA. Shortly thereafter, in 2016, Perth Motorplex returned to ANDRA sanctioning following an extensive tender process run by the Western Australia State Government, which owns the Perth Motorplex. ANDRA was deemed to have a more comprehensive set or rules and procedures which Drag Racing events would be run in accordance with, one major point being that IHRA Australia did not submit a proposal to the Government. IHRA Australia does not have a published rulebook. ANDRA has periodically run Group One cars since (Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock), as most teams have switched to IHRA and its 400 Thunder series. However, recently Top Fuel Australia (the organization that represents the Top Fuel Team owners) extracted itself from the 400 Thunder Series due to the series lack of National coverage and steady decline since its inception. More recently, the Australian Government appointed Motorsport Australia organization stated that it does not acknowledge IHRA Australia as a Drag Racing sanctioning body, for numerous reasons.

<doc id="708166" wikidata="Q7894215" url="?curid=708166" title="Universe Symphony (Ives)">
<text>The Universe Symphony is an unfinished work by American classical music composer Charles Ives.

The date of composition is unknown, but he probably worked on it periodically between 1911 and 1928. Intended to be a spatial composition for two or more orchestras, it is in three sections:

Ives conceived the idea during the autumn of 1915 while he was staying in the Adirondacks of New York State, but he left it alone until 1923, when he returned to working on it. Although he spent many years on it, many of the sketches are missing. During the 1990s there were three separate performing versions assembled, including a version by David Gray Porter (1993, Section A plus the Coda and part of a first Prelude only), Larry Austin (1994), and Johnny Reinhard (1996).

It is a complex work, using 20 independent musical lines; each moves in a separate meter, only coinciding on downbeats eight seconds apart. According to his notes on a sketch of the Universe Symphony, Ives was &quot;striving to ... paint the creation, the mysterious beginnings of all things known through God and man, to trace with tonal imprints the vastness, the evolution of all life, in nature, of humanity from the great roots of life to the spiritual eternities, from the great inknown to the great unknown.&quot; Ives envisioned the work being performed by multiple orchestras located in valleys, on hillsides and mountains, with the music mimicking &quot;the eternal pulse ... the planetary motion of the earth ... the soaring lines of mountains and cliffs ... deep ravines, sharp jagged edges of rock&quot;.
Pages are missing or were never written.

The first part (&quot;Section A&quot;) was derived from a sketch of 1915 for a piece called &quot;The Earth and the Heavens&quot; or &quot;The Earth and the Firmament&quot;, with one group of instruments representing the Earth and another group representing the Heavens, and with a group of percussion instruments representing the eternal pulse of the universe underlying both. This is the most complete large fragment of the piece, along with a Coda for the complete movement written in a similar style that shares the same four main &quot;Earth-themes&quot; of Section A. The main &quot;sky-theme&quot; is the only theme built upon a quotation, the hymn tune &quot;Bethany&quot; (&quot;Nearer My God to Thee&quot;, the same hymn tune used as the basis for the Finale of his Fourth Symphony.)

There were also to be three Preludes to the Symphony, but none were completed. The most complete is the first Prelude, but again this was not completed, left only in the form of an outline-sketch with musical examples. For more information see James B. Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Descriptive Catalogue&quot; of Ives&#x27;s music and manuscripts (1999). In addition, Reinhard has written a detailed history of Ives&#x27;s composition of the Universe Symphony as well as his own process in preparing a performance edition from Ives&#x27;s sketches.

==Instrumentation==
The score calls for unorthodox instrumentation, as follows:

*Woodwinds: 9 flutes (2 doubling piccolo, 1 doubling wooden flute), 2 oboes, 3 clarinets, 5 bassoons (2 doubling contrabassoon)
*Brass: 5 trumpets, 4 horns, 4 trombones, 2 tubas
*Keyboards: piano or celeste, organ
*Strings: harp, 8 violins, 5 violas, 4 cellos, 3 double basses
*Percussion: 12 percussionists (low bell, bass drum and cymbal, low gong, bass drum, timpani, triangle, high gong, log drum, piccolo tympani, Indian drum, snare drum, 2 kinds of metal pipe, high brittle wood, medium small xylophone, clay pipes, different sizes of wood blocks and boards, low xylophone, large tambourine, small triangle, wood block, high bell, suspended cymbal, glasses, drum rims, small steel bars, castanets, marble slab)

Another realization, by conductor Larry Austin, is for the following instrumentation, broken into seven distinct groups:

*Group A (The Heavens): solo clarinet, solo viola, piano doubling celesta, 1 percussionist (vibraphone, 5 singing bowls, 4 rototoms, 2 log drums, flexatone, wooden and metal wind chimes), at least 10 violins and 2 violas
*Group B (The Heavens): 2 oboes, English horn, 1 percussionist (marimba, 4 temple blocks, claves, small gong, triangle, large suspended cymbal, wooden wind chimes, woodblock, bass drum), at least 8 violins and 2 violas
*Group C (The Heavens): 2 flutes, alto flute (doubling piccolo), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 1 percussionist (vibraphone, 4 ceramic cup gongs, crotale in A, large tam-tam, large triangle, small cymbal, metal wind chimes)
*Group D (The Heavens): harp, 1 percussionist (marimba, 4 woodblocks, crotale in E, large gong, castanets, medium-large cymbal, wooden wind chimes, bass drum with cymbals attached), at least 6 violins and 2 violas
*Group E (The Life Pulse): piccolo, piano, 20 percussionists (glockenspiel, 2 triangles and tambourine, first xylophone, second xylophone, ceramic bells or small pipes, 5 woodblocks, first snare drum, second snare drum, third snare drum and tom-tom, tenor drum, small gong and piccolo timpano, bass drum with cymbals attached, marimba, timpano, tam-tam, low bell, large bass drum, deep hanging bell)
*Group F (The Earth and Rock Formations): 4 trumpets (doubling 2 piccolo trumpets in Bb and one in D), 4 horns, 2 tenor trombones, 2 bass trombones, tuba, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon
*Group G (The Earth Chord): at least 5 celli and 5 double basses

Groups A, B, C and D each require assistant conductors; group E needs as many as four assistants.

<text>Robert Brier (; born December 13, 1943) is an American Egyptologist specializing in paleopathology. A senior research fellow at Long Island University/LIU Post, he has researched and published on mummies and the mummification process and has appeared in many Discovery Civilization, TLC Network, and National Geographic documentaries, primarily on ancient Egypt. He is recognized as one of the world&#x27;s foremost Egyptologists.

==Background==

Born and raised in The Bronx, New York, Brier earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Hunter College of the City University of New York. He earned his PhD in philosophy from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1970 and began teaching at Long Island University in 1972. He served as chairman of the philosophy department from 1981 to 1996 and has also served as the director of the National Endowment for the Humanities&#x27; &quot;Egyptology Today&quot; program. He was appointed senior research fellow at LIU Post in 2004. In addition to his career at Long Island University, Brier has taught ancient Egyptian at The New School and Egyptology at Webb Institute for many years.

==Research and other achievements==

Brier has worked in pyramids and tombs in 15 countries and conducted research in mummification practices worldwide. He has investigated well-known mummies such as Tutankhamen, Ramses the Great, Vladimir Lenin, Eva Perón (more commonly known as Evita), and the Medici family.

In 1994 Brier and a colleague, Ronald Wade, director of the State Anatomy Board of Maryland, mummified a human cadaver using ancient Egyptian techniques which they noted was the first known effort in 2,000 years. This research earned Brier the affectionate nickname &quot;Mr. Mummy&quot; and was also the subject of the National Geographic television special of the same name, which made him a household name. He is also the host of several television programs for the TLC Network including &quot;The Great Egyptians&quot;, &quot;Pyramids&quot;, &quot;Mummies and Tombs&quot;, and &quot;Mummy Detective&quot;. His research has been featured in &quot;Archaeology Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, CNN, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot;.

In 1999, Brier gave a series of 48 specially-prepared lectures entitled &quot;The History of Ancient Egypt&quot; for The Teaching Company. He later did two more series of lectures for them. One focused on &quot;Great Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt&quot; and the other &quot;Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs&quot;.

<text>Canary Wharf is an Elizabeth line station in Canary Wharf in East London, England. The station forms an artificial island in the West India Docks (North Dock). The five upper levels of the station are a mixed-use development known as Crossrail Place. It is on the Abbey Wood branch of the Elizabeth line between and Custom House. Construction began in May 2009, and the station opened on 24 May 2022 when the section between Paddington and Abbey Wood stations began services. During the project&#x27;s development the station was named &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;, before the current name was adopted. The station was developed under a fixed price contract of £500 million with £350 million provided from the Crossrail budget and £150 million from the Canary Wharf Group with Crossrail spending an additional £80 million on safety improvements before it was opened.

The station is one of the largest on the Elizabeth line, providing Canary Wharf with a connection to the National Rail network and additionally an interchange with Canary Wharf station on the London Underground as well as Canary Wharf, West India Quay and Poplar stations on the Docklands Light Railway.

==Design and construction==
The station is located beneath and within the West India North Dock on an artificial island and extends from east of the Docklands Light Railway bridge to the east end of the dock. It stands within a long concrete box with a long island platform. It is fitted out to with the potential for extension should the need to operate longer trains arise.

===Original design===
The main access point for the Crossrail station was initially going to be the rebuilt Great Wharf Bridge. From this entrance there would have been a set of escalators to the concourse level, which would have been located underwater. Another bank of escalators would take passengers to the platforms.

Construction of the station was to predominantly take place on Hertsmere Road, which runs parallel to the West India North Dock. This would have involved digging a wide shaft to the station depth of below the dock water-level to enable crew and equipment to begin boring the box that would form the station. The construction including fit-out and commissioning of the Hertsmere Road shaft was expected to take approximately four years whilst the same would take five years for the station.

===Redesign and construction===
In December 2008 an extra £150 million of funding from the Canary Wharf Group was announced for the station with work due to commence in January 2009. As part of the deal Canary Wharf Group substantially redesigned the station, incorporating a large shopping centre and a park above the platforms situated in the middle of the dock.

A ground-breaking ceremony for the station development was held on 15 May 2009.

Throughout 2009 the main focus was on installing 293 interlocking steel piles high and wide into the dock floor using ten-storey high piling cranes and Giken piling machines to form a cofferdam. As part of this, deep reinforced concrete piles were placed through each of the 293 tubes.

On 11 February 2010 Sadiq Khan, then Transport Minister, activated pumps designed to drain nearly 100 million litres () from the work site over the following six weeks. The pumps transferred water from inside the site&#x27;s cofferdam to the North Dock at a maximum rate of per minute.

A station &#x27;box&#x27; was constructed in a dry environment in a similar technique to that used in the construction of the nearby Canary Wharf Underground station. Crossrail Place is the structure above the platforms and was partly opened on 1 May 2015. In September 2015, the station construction was completed and the focus has shifted to fitting the station screen doors, ticket machines and other things before the station is scheduled for opening.
The station project became the subject of a dispute between Crossrail and developer Canary Wharf Group after Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild said work was inadequate. The station &quot;had to have a wholesale retrofit, particularly in the safety systems,&quot; and Wild said the station required an extra £80m to fix. Canary Wharf Group dismissed the comments as &quot;an attempt to pass blame for the delays on Crossrail&quot;. Wild said: &quot;The key issues [at Canary Wharf] have been the quality of the electrical installation [redacted phrase] and the extensive safety critical upgrade work that has been required.&quot; The work was completed and handed over in January 2022, ahead of the official opening as part of the beginning of services between Paddington and Abbey Wood on 24 May 2022.

==Ownership==
Whilst the Elizabeth line operates services at the station as a train operating company and forms a part of National Rail, all infrastructure is owned and maintained by Transport for London and not by Network Rail.

==Services==

All services at Canary Wharf are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to 
* 4 tph to of which 2 continue to 
* 4 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 12 tph in each direction.

* the Dartford Loop Line via Sidcup.

Westbound services normally terminate at London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street (both via London Bridge), London Victoria and, for Thameslink trains, Luton and Bedford. Services from London also continue through Dartford to Greenhithe (for Bluewater) to terminate at Gravesend, Strood, Rochester or Gillingham. Thameslink trains terminate at Rainham.

Many of the terminating services at Dartford form London bound services, but the remainder will be stabled and maintained at Slade Green Depot approximately two miles west on the North Kent Line. There are several sidings to the east of the station where terminating trains can be stabled until such time as needed to return to Dartford to form London bound services or until drivers are available to return the train to Slade Green Depot.

== History ==
The first station was opened here by the South Eastern Railway. It extended its North Kent Line from Gravesend on 30 July 1849, taking the line from there to London. The original station building had an Italianate design; this was replaced by a glass and metal ticket office complex in 1972. A footbridge leads across the line to the two island platforms.

Replacement of the 1972 station building was approved in 2011, with enabling works started late that year, and major works commenced in mid-2012. The new building was completed in November 2013.

==Future development==

In the future, Dartford station may form part of a Crossrail extension line, linking to Canary Wharf, London Paddington station, Heathrow Airport and Reading.

==Trivia==
In 1961, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards met by chance at the station, going on to be the core writing team of the Rolling Stones. There is a plaque on the London-bound platform to commemorate this fact.

Dartford railway station gained a lot of attention due to the high numbers of people travelling using this line, mistakenly not knowing that Oyster cards were not valid, and there was evidence of being approached by staff and receiving penalty fares. In September 2015 Transport for London extended the London fare zones to add Dartford to zone 8, thus allowing Oyster and Contactless payment methods to be used there.

==Concessionary and electronic ticketing==

===Oyster and contactless bank cards===
Dartford entered the TfL zonal Oyster/contactless system on Sunday 6 September 2015, in Zone 8. Whilst season tickets, daily capping and contactless weekly capping are set at standard Zone 8 levels, single fares from Dartford are lower than &quot;standard&quot; Zone 8 fares.

This followed Southeastern agreement to seek to bring Oyster/Contactless PAYG to Dartford by 31 January 2016 as part of the 2014–2018 franchise extension.

<doc id="708181" wikidata="Q1452270" url="?curid=708181" title="Subtext">
<text>In any communication, in any medium or format, &quot;subtext&quot; is the underlying or implicit meaning that, while not explicitly stated, is understood by an audience. 

The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as &quot;an underlying and often distinct theme in a conversation, piece of writing, etc.&quot;, while according to Merriam-Webster, subtext is &quot;the implicit or metaphorical meaning (as of a literary text)&quot;. 

These definitions highlight that subtext involves themes or messages that are not directly conveyed, but can be inferred.

==About subtext==

Subtext is content &quot;sub&quot; i.e. &quot;under&quot; (with the sense of &quot;hidden beneath&quot;) the verbatim wording; readers or audience must &quot;gather&quot; subtext &quot;reading between the lines&quot; or inferring meaning, a process needed for a clear and complete understanding of the text. A meaning stated explicitly is, by definition not subtext (for lack of hiding), and writers may be criticized for failure artfully to create and use subtext; such works may be faulted as too &quot;on the nose&quot;, with the characters meaning what they literally have said, undermining dramatic tension, and leaving the work too prosaic.

Subtext also may be included in the action of narratives, with secondary themes expressed in order to appeal to a general audience. Such approaches to sexual or otherwise more adult story-content, in works accessible to the young, often fails to &quot;register&quot; for the young reader, though adults will catch the child-invisible nuances.

==Formats for creating subtext==

Below are the main types of subtext that are used in film:
*Have a character comment on an aspect of another person&#x27;s relationship which is present in the relationship of the people in the current conversation.
*Body language communicates subtext. Body language is often used to convey whether a character is welcoming or threatening.
*Implied accusations, often communicated through leading questions, are a form of subtext. For example, when a lawyer asks you &quot;what were you doing on the night of the 23rd&quot;, that is an implied accusation.
*Facial expressions and voice tone express many things including discontent and suspicion. For example, a quiet one-word answer to a question implies that the speaker is lying and that they do not want to say the true answer.
*The subtext of how much people care for each other can be communicated by showing the amount of care, interest, and attentiveness people have for each other&#x27;s opinions, desires, and character traits.
Linguistic implicature studies the kinds of subtext that are often used within language itself.

<text>Goodmayes railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line serving the district of Goodmayes in the London Borough of Redbridge, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is GMY, and it is in Travelcard Zone 4.

The station was opened in 1901 by the Great Eastern Railway. It is managed and served by the Elizabeth line.

==History==
Goodmayes station was opened on 8 February 1901 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on the Great Eastern Main Line out of London Liverpool Street at the same time as the line between and was being upgraded from 2 tracks to 4 tracks.

Although delayed by World War 2, electrification of the local tracks of the Great Eastern line between and finally opened on 7 November 1949 and steam-hauled trains using articulated carriages and N7 tank engines were replaced by Class 306 Electric Multiple Units. These in turn were replaced by Class 315 units from 1980.

===Yards and connections===
There was an extensive freight yard for goods traffic on the down side of the line which extended from the station building a considerable distance towards . This was a busy yard with a signal box controlling movements, and after 1900 a turntable and water tower were added, and part of the yard was given over to Permanent Way maintenance. The yard closed in 1962 and after the tracks were removed the land was grassed until replaced by a supermarket, other shops and housing.

At the end of the 19th Century a short line extended from the eastern end of the yard and curved away under the High Road to a gravel pit. This line was still extant in 1914 but had been removed by 1938 when housing covered the area.

Early in the 20th Century a large yard was constructed on the up side of the line extending as far as Kinfauns Road. Associated with this was the Becontree Estate Railway which built to transport materials that were used in construction of the Becontree Estate, although this was removed after construction of the estate was completed.

===Elizabeth line===
In 2017 new trains entered operation on the Shenfield – London Liverpool Street route as the new Crossrail service partially opened. The four platforms at Goodmayes have been extended from their current length of to accommodate the new trains, which are over long at their full nine carriage length. The station also received three new lifts providing access to all platforms, improved lighting and signage, help points, and new ticket machines and gates within a refurbished ticket hall.

<text>Chadwell Heath railway station is a stop on the Great Eastern Main Line in Chadwell Heath, which straddles the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking &amp; Dagenham in East London, England. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . Its three-letter station code is CTH and it is in Travelcard Zone 5.

The station was opened in 1864 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on the line between London and Romford built by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1839 (extended in 1840 to Brentwood and thereafter to Colchester and Norwich); the GER had taken over the line in 1862. The station is currently managed and served by the Elizabeth line.

==History==
===Great Eastern Railway (1864–1922)===

Chadwell Heath station was opened on 11 January 1864 and is built on the site of Wangey House, one of Dagenham&#x27;s oldest buildings dating back to 1250. Wangey House was partly demolished when the Eastern Counties Railway built the line in the 1830s; the last surviving portion was demolished when the Great Eastern Railway widened the line in 1901.

Chadwell Heath had just two platforms linked by a footbridge when it opened in 1864; a Great Eastern Railway mid-Victorian single-storey ticket office was attached to a two-storey station master’s house at platform level, fronting a station approach leading down from what was then called Chitty’s Lane (now Station Road) which crossed the tracks on an overbridge. A simple open waiting shelter with projecting canopy sheltered the London-bound platform. All of this was swept away in 1900, when the line was quadrupled between and in 1899-1902; a new station with four platforms was opened in 1901. The ticket office was relocated over the tracks and was the same design as and ; a dual-pitched roof structure of red brick with stone dressings, a semi-circular pediment above the entrance which was sheltered by a generous twin-arched canopy; miniature arched pediments topping the end gables.

A signal box existed between the two sets of running lines and this controlled access to the east end of Goodmayes Goods Yard which stretched from Chadwell Heath to Goodmayes station. 

At the other end of the station, Chadwell Heath had a small goods yard that predominantly dealt with domestic coal traffic and this had a small signal box controlling access.

In 1923, the GER amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

===London and North Eastern Railway (1923–1947)===
Chadwell Heath was the focus for the housing estate temporary railway built for the construction of the Becontree estate in the period 1926–33.

The housing estate was not well served by public transport and, by the mid 1930s, 24 trains were operating towards London between 05:30 and 09:48 in the morning.

During this period, local stopping trains were generally hauled by LNER Class N7 locomotives on trains of corridor type carriage stock.
Plans were drawn up in the 1930s to electrify the suburban lines from Liverpool Street to at 1,500VDC and work was started on implementing this. However, the outbreak of the Second World War brought the project to a temporary halt and it was not until 1949 that the scheme was completed.

The station suffered a direct bomb hit in April 1941, which wrecked platform 1 and the footbridge, and damaged the ticket office. The damage was repaired but the damaged semi-circular pediments to the ticket office façade and the end gables were all removed; a simple box-style canopy replaced the elaborate late Victorian original.

===British Railways (1948–1994)===
On 1 January 1948, following nationalisation of the railways, Chadwell Heath became part of the British Railways Eastern Region.

The electrification scheme saw the two signal boxes closed as the signalling was upgraded. First to close was Chadwell Heath Goods Yard box on 26 August 1949, followed by Chadwell Heath on 10 July 1949. The area was covered by a new box.

From February 1949, the Class 306 electric multiple units (EMUs) operated the service to steam timings, but an accelerated all electric schedule was introduced in September 1949.

During the 1960s, the goods yard and Goodmayes freight yard were both closed.

The signal box, dating from 1949, closed in June 1972 with responsibility for signalling the area passing to Goodmayes.

In 1980, the first Class 315 EMUs were introduced to replace the Class 306s. The 315s were in service until 2022 and were used on passenger trains serving Chadwell Heath. Around this time, many of the 1901 platform buildings were demolished.

The stopping services usually call at platforms 3 and 4, whilst platforms 1 and 2 are used by longer distance services to/from , , and .

The railway was sectorised in 1982; Chadwell Heath and the trains calling at it became part of the London and South-East sector. On 10 June 1986, this was rebranded to become Network SouthEast which was responsible for working services up to privatisation.

===Privatisation Era (1994 - present day)===
In April 1994, Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure; it was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002.

Between privatisation on 1 April 1994 and 4 January 1997, the station was operated by a non-privatised business unit.

Passenger services calling at the station have been operated by the following franchises:
* First Great Eastern: 5 January 1997 – 31 March 2004
* National Express East Anglia: 1 April 2004 – 4 February 2012
* Abellio Greater Anglia: 5 February 2012 – 30 May 2015
* MTR TFL Rail: 31 May 2015 - 23 May 2022; after which the line was rebranded as the Elizabeth Line which is the current operator.

In June 2017, new trains began entering service in preparation for the opening of the Crossrail line. As of March 2023, the four platforms at Chadwell Heath station have been extended from their previous length of to accommodate the Crossrail trains which are over long as they have been extended to nine carriages. New lifts, signage, help points, customer information screens and CCTV were installed. Additionally, a new passing loop for freight traffic was constructed to the west of the station, to replace the disused loop further up the line at .

Initially, Elizabeth Line services from Chadwell Heath operated into Liverpool Street only; on 22 November 2022, services were able to operate through central London and onto .

==Services==
All services at Chadwell Heath are operated by the Elizabeth line using electric multiple units.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 8 tph to , of which 2 continue to 
* 8 tph to 

During peak hours, the station is served by a number of additional services between Liverpool Street and ; these services do not call at .

On Sundays, the service to and from Shenfield is reduced to 4 tph, with alternating services running only as far as Gidea Park.

<text>Harold Wood railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line in east London, serving Harold Wood in the London Borough of Havering. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between Gidea Park and Brentwood. Its three-letter station code is HRO and it is in Travelcard zone 6.

The station is currently managed and served by the Elizabeth line.

==History==
Harold Wood station was opened on 1 December 1868 by the Great Eastern Railway in the north of the parish of Hornchurch. It was located on its main line from in London to the east of England and consisted of two staggered platforms of wooden construction, the down platform accessed from Station Road and the up platform from Oak Road. Goods facilities consisted of two sidings on the north side of the line opposite the up platform, and there was also a long siding serving a brickworks. A signal box was provided at the up end of the down platform controlling the signals, access to the goods facilities, and a trailing crossover.

Two additional tracks were built to the north of the original lines in 1934 under London and North Eastern Railway ownership. The original tracks are normally used today by express services which do not call at Harold Wood. At this time the current station building was constructed on the overbridge at Gubbins Lane, and new platforms of precast concrete construction located slightly further east nearer to the new station building. The signal box was removed as part of these works, with control of the new colour light signals shared between Gidea Park and Brentwood.

==Services==
All services at Harold Wood are operated by the Elizabeth line using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 8 tph to of which 2 continue to 
* 8 tph to 

On Sundays, the service is reduced to 4 tph in each direction between Shenfield and London Paddington with 2 tph continuing to run to and from Heathrow Terminal 5.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 256, 294, 346 and 496 serve the station.

<doc id="708189" wikidata="Q30671684" url="?curid=708189" title="Chapel of ease">
<text>A chapel of ease (or chapel-of-ease) is a church building other than the parish church, built within the bounds of a parish for the attendance of those who cannot reach the parish church conveniently, generally due to distance away.

Often a chapel of ease is deliberately built as such, being more accessible to some parishioners than the main church. Such a chapel may exist, for example, when a parish covers several dispersed villages, or a central village together with its satellite hamlet or hamlets. In such a case the parish church will be in the main settlement, with one or more chapels of ease in the subordinate village(s) and/or hamlet(s). An example is the chapel belonging to All Hallows&#x27; Parish in Maryland, United States. The chapel was built in Davidsonville from 1860 to 1865 because the parish&#x27;s &quot;Brick Church&quot; in South River was distance which took an hour to walk each way. A more extreme example is the Chapel-of-Ease built in 1818 on St. David&#x27;s Island in Bermuda to spare St. David&#x27;s Islanders crossing St. George&#x27;s Harbour to reach the parish church, St. Peter&#x27;s, on St. George&#x27;s Island.

Some chapels of ease are buildings which used to be the main parish church until a larger building was constructed for that purpose. For example, the small village of Norton, Hertfordshire, contains the mediaeval church of St Nicholas, which served it adequately for centuries, but when the large new town of Letchworth was built, partly within the parish, St Nicholas&#x27;s became too small to serve the increased population. This led to the building of a new main church for the parish, and St Nicholas&#x27;s became a chapel of ease.
Chapels of ease are sometimes associated with large manor houses, where they provide a convenient place of worship for the family of the manor, and for the domestic and rural staff of the house and the estate. There are many such chapels in England, for example that at Pedlinge in Kent. An example in the New World is Saint John&#x27;s Chapel of Ease in Chamcook, New Brunswick, Canada, which was built in the 1840s to support a gentleman&#x27;s house and the small nearby settlement of shipbuilders, farmers, and a grist-mill.

Sometimes an ancient parish church is reduced in status to a chapel of ease due to a shift of population. The churches of St Mary Wiston and All Saints&#x27; at Buncton in West Sussex are an example of this. For centuries St Mary&#x27;s was the parish church, located near to Wiston House and therefore the centre of population, whilst All Saints&#x27; served the nearby hamlet of Buncton, as a chapel of ease. Today, however, the resident population of Wiston is tiny, whilst Buncton has grown, so that in 2007 the status of the buildings was reversed, with All Saints&#x27; becoming the parish church, and St Mary&#x27;s reduced to a chapel of ease.

When two or more existing parishes are combined into a single parish, one or more of the old church buildings may be kept as a chapel of ease. For example, the six Roman Catholic parishes in Palo Alto, California, were combined into a single parish, St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in 1987. Since then, St. Thomas Aquinas Church serves as the parish church, with Our Lady of the Rosary Church and St. Albert the Great Church as chapels of ease.

When a parish is split because of expanding population a chapel of ease may be promoted to a full parish church. An example of this is St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Rochester in Kent which started as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Nicholas in 1108, became a parish church in 1488 then reverted to a chapel of ease when the parish was recombined with St Peter&#x27;s in 1953.

<doc id="708195" wikidata="Q708653" url="?curid=708195" title="Death certificate">
<text>A death certificate is either a legal document issued by a medical practitioner which states when a person died, or a document issued by a government civil registration office, that declares the date, location and cause of a person&#x27;s death, as entered in an official register of deaths.

An official death certificate is usually required to be provided when applying for probate or administration of a deceased estate. They are also sought for genealogical research. The government registration office would usually be required to provide details of deaths, without production of a death certificate, to enable government agencies to update their records, such as electoral registers, government benefits paid, passport records, transfer the inheritance, etc.

==Nature of a certificate==
Before issuing a death certificate, the authorities usually require a certificate from a physician or coroner to validate the cause of death and the identity of the deceased. In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead (usually because their body is being sustained by life support), a neurologist is often called in to verify brain death and to fill out the appropriate documentation. The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government (to trigger issuance of the death certificate) is often both a crime and cause for loss of one&#x27;s license to practice. This is because of past cases in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or vote in elections.

A full explanation of the cause of death includes any other diseases and disorders the person had at the time of death, even though they did not directly cause the death.

The cause of death combined with the occupation and industry information, is used for public health research purposes:

* Detecting new illnesses or injuries occurring in relation to specific industries or occupations.
* Monitoring known associations between job hazards and illnesses (e.g., Black Lung Disease, once thought to be on the decline within the coal industry, reemerged in 2019).
* Calculating burden of illness for specific industries or occupations to prioritize research.
* Guiding prevention efforts and more in-depth research on links between work and health.

==History==
Historically, in Europe and North America, death records were kept by the local churches, along with baptism and marriage records. In 1639, in what would become the United States, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first to have the secular courts keep these records. By the end of the 19th century, European countries were adopting centralized systems for recording deaths.

In the United States, a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910.

==Specific jurisdictions==
=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====
When someone dies in England and Wales, a doctor involved in their care completes a &quot;medical certificate of cause of death&quot; (MCCD). This is then forwarded to the register office to register the person&#x27;s death. The General Register Office, which is a section of HM Passport Office, is responsible for civil registration services in England and Wales.

==== Scotland ====
National registration began in 1855; registrations are rather more detailed.

=== United States ===
In most of the United States, death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester&#x27;s relationship to the deceased. Other jurisdictions restrict to whom death certificates are issued. For example, in the State of New York, only close relatives can obtain a death certificate, including the spouse, parent, child or sibling of the deceased, and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim, documented medical need, or New York State court order.

==Stillbirths==
===United States===
A 2007 article in &quot;People&quot; magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a birth certificate and a death certificate. Most states instead issue a &quot;certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth&quot;.

<text>Not proven (, ) is a verdict available to a court of law in Scotland. Under Scots law, a criminal trial may end in one of three verdicts, one of conviction (&quot;guilty&quot;) and two of acquittal (&quot;not proven&quot; and &quot;not guilty&quot;).

Between the Restoration in the late 17th century and the early 18th century, jurors in Scotland were expected only to find whether individual factual allegations were proven or not proven, rather than to rule on an accused&#x27;s guilt. In 1728, the jury in a murder trial asserted &quot;its ancient right&quot; to declare a defendant &quot;not guilty&quot;. Over time, the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict regained wide acceptance and use amongst Scots juries, with the encouragement of defence lawyers. It eventually displaced &quot;not proven&quot; as the primary verdict of acquittal. Nowadays, juries can return a verdict of either &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;, with the same legal effect of acquittal.

Although historically it may be a similar verdict to not guilty, in the present day not proven is typically used by a jury when there is a belief that the defendant is guilty but The Crown has not provided sufficient evidence. Scots law requires corroboration; the evidence of one witness, however credible, is not sufficient to prove a charge against an accused or to establish any material or crucial fact.

In Scotland, there have been attempts to abolish what Sir Walter Scott famously called &quot;that bastard verdict&quot;. In 1827, Scott, who was sheriff in the court of Selkirk, wrote in his journal that &quot;the jury gave that bastard verdict, &quot;Not proven&quot;.

It is proposed to remove the not proven verdict as part of a 2023 judicial reform.

==History==
By the early 17th century, the standard practice of juries in Scotland was to return a finding of &quot;fylet, culpable and convict&quot; or &quot;clene, innocent and acquit&quot;. This changed in the late 17th century, at which point the role of the jury became simply to &quot;declare whether or not the facts alleged had been proved&quot;, with the judge left to determine, based on that declaration, whether the accused was guilty or not.

There is some disagreement between historians as to why this change happened. David Hume and Hugo Arnot argue that it was rooted in religious oppression. The Crown persecuted the Covenanters but popular support made it impossible to convict them in a jury trial. To pare the power of the jury, the Scottish judges began restricting the jury&#x27;s role: no longer would the jury announce whether the accused was &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot;; instead it would decide whether specific factual allegations were &quot;proven&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;; and the judge would then decide whether to convict.

===Reintroduction of &quot;not guilty&quot;===
In 1728, in the trial of Carnegie of Finhaven for the murder of the Earl of Strathmore, the defence lawyer (Robert Dundas) persuaded a jury to reassert its ancient right of acquitting, of finding an accused &quot;not guilty&quot;, in spite of the facts being proven. The law required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of &quot;proven&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot; depending on whether they believed the evidence proved that the accused had killed the Earl. Carnegie had undoubtedly killed the Earl, but had also clearly not intended to do so. If the jury brought in a &quot;proven&quot; verdict they would in effect constrain the judge to find Carnegie guilty of murder, for which the punishment was hanging. To avert this outcome, the jury asserted what it believed to be their &quot;ancient right&quot; to judge the whole case and not just the facts, and brought in the verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;.

The reintroduction of the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was part of a wider movement during the 17th and 18th century which saw a gradual increase in the power of juries, such as the trial of William Penn in 1670, in which an English jury first gained the right to pass a verdict contrary to the law (known as jury nullification), and the trial of John Peter Zenger in New York in 1735 in which jury nullification is credited with establishing freedom of the press as a firm right in what became the United States. Legal academic Ian Willock argues that the 1728 case was &quot;of great significance in calling a halt to a process of attrition which might have led to the total extinction of the criminal jury&quot;.

Although jurors continued to use both &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot; after 1728, jurors tended to favour the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict over the &quot;not proven&quot; and the interpretation changed.

===Calls for reform===
There have been repeated calls to abolish the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict since the middle of the 20th century. In 1975, the Thomson Committee on Criminal Procedure in Scotland (chaired by Lord Thomson) recommended retaining the three-verdict system. The Scottish Office consulted on removing &quot;not proven&quot; in 1994. Unsuccessful attempts to scrap the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict were made in Parliament by Donald Dewar in 1969, George Robertson in 1993 (prompted by the trial outcome in the murder of Amanda Duffy) and Lord Macauly of Bragar in 1995. A members&#x27; bill to abolish the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict was debated in the Scottish Parliament in 2016, but was rejected by 80 votes to 28.

Proponents of reform argue that the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict is widely regarded as an acquittal used when the judge or jury does not have enough evidence to convict but is not sufficiently convinced of the accused person&#x27;s innocence to bring in a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. Essentially, the judge or jury is unconvinced that the suspect is innocent, but guilt has not been proven &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. Conversely, its opponents argue that a two-verdict system would lead to an increase in wrongful convictions.

Following a not proven verdict in a criminal trial in 2015, Miss M successfully sued Stephen Coxen in the civil courts, in what was the first civil damages action for rape following an unsuccessful criminal prosecution in almost 100 years. In 2018, Miss M launched #EndNotProven alongside Rape Crisis Scotland, calling for Not Proven to be removed and citing the disproportionate use in rape cases, the widespread misunderstandings of the verdict and fears that it is being used as an &#x27;easy way out&#x27; by jurors.

In April 2023, the Scottish government published the Victims, Witnesses, and Justice Reform Bill which, if passed, will abolish the not proven verdict. In April 2024, the Scottish Parliament voted to advance the bill to Stage 2, where members can submit amendments on the bill to committee.

==Current procedure==
In Scotland, a criminal case may be decided either &quot;in solemn procedure&quot; by a jury (instructed by the judge), or &quot;in summary procedure&quot; by the judge alone (with no jury appointed). There are various rules for when the one or the other procedure may or must be employed; in general, juries are employed for the more severe accusations, while petty crimes and offences are treated summarily. A criminal case jury consists of fifteen jurors, who make their decision by a simple majority vote: eight votes are necessary and sufficient for the verdict &quot;guilty&quot;, which has replaced the verdict &quot;proven&quot;.

Approximately one-third of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries use the formulation &quot;not proven&quot;; the others use &quot;not guilty&quot;. The verdict &quot;not proven&quot; also is available for judges in the summary procedure, and is employed in about a fifth of such acquittals. The proportion of &quot;not proven&quot; acquittals, in general, is higher in the more severe cases; but so then are the proportion of acquittals versus convictions. This might have many different reasons, for example that on average it might be more difficult to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the more severe cases.

&quot;Not proven&quot; is sometimes interpreted as indicating that the jury or judge is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find the evidence sufficient for a conviction.

==Use in other jurisdictions==

In general, the Scottish verdict has not been permanently adopted outside its home country, but it was sometimes used in colonial Canada, especially by some judges in southwestern Ontario. Its most famous use in the United States came when Senator Arlen Specter tried to vote &quot;not proven&quot; on the two articles of impeachment of Bill Clinton (his votes were recorded as &quot;not guilty&quot;) and when, at the O. J. Simpson murder case, various reformers, including Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman&#x27;s father, pushed for a change to &quot;not proven&quot; because of what they felt was an incorrect presumption of innocence on the part of Simpson. The verdict is often referenced in US cases where the jury is obliged to find the state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but there is widespread feeling that the defendant does not deserve the exoneration of a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. A popular saying about the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict is that it means &quot;not guilty, but don&#x27;t do it again&quot;.

In 2005, a proposal was made in the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; to introduce the not proven verdict into the United States.

<doc id="708208" wikidata="Q2167348" url="?curid=708208" title="Globalism">
<text>Globalism has multiple meanings. In political science, it is used to describe &quot;attempts to understand all of the interconnections of the modern world—and to highlight patterns that underlie (and explain) them&quot;. While primarily associated with world-systems, it can be used to describe other global trends. The concept of globalism is also classically used to focus on ideologies of globalization (the subjective meanings) instead of its processes (the objective practices); in this sense, &quot;globalism&quot; is to globalization what &quot;nationalism&quot; is to nationality.

The term &quot;the globalists&quot; was popularized by Alex Jones, and used interchangeably with the concepts of a New World Order and the deep state. This term is now frequently used as a pejorative by far-right movements and conspiracy theorists. It is sometimes associated with antisemitism, as antisemites frequently appropriate the term &quot;Globalist&quot; to refer to Jews.

== Definition ==
Paul James defines &quot;globalism&quot;

Early ideas of globalism were also expressed by Adam Smith through his views on the role of commodities in distinguishing the civilized from the barbarous, which was deeply embedded in the ideology of empires.

Manfred Steger distinguishes among different globalisms, such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism. Market globalism includes the ideology of neoliberalism. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. In his 2005 book &quot;The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World&quot;, Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests in both positive and destructive ways. 

Political scientists Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane, major thinkers of liberal institutionalism as a new international relations theory, generalized the term to argue that &quot;globalism&quot; refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by networks of connections that span multi-continental distances, while globalization refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism. The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization, such as whether globalization is unprecedented or not. For example, this use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.

Globalization has been used to describe international endeavours begun after World War II, such as the United Nations, the Warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, and sometimes the later neoliberal and neoconservative policies of nation building and military interventionism between the end of the Cold War in 1991 and the beginning of the war on terror in 2001. Historically in the international relations of the 1970s and 1980s, globalism and regionalism had been defined somewhat differently due to the Cold War. Analysts discussed a globalism vs. regionalism dichotomy, in which globalists believed that international events more often arose from great power competition (then U.S.–Soviet rivalry), whereas regionalists believed they more often arose from local factors.

== Concept ==
The term first came into a widespread usage in the United States of America. The earliest use of the word is from 1943, in the book &quot;The War for Man&#x27;s Soul&quot; by Ernst Jäckh, who used it to describe Adolf Hitler&#x27;s global ambitions.
The modern concept of globalism arose in the post-war debates of the 1940s in the United States. In their position of unprecedented power, planners formulated policies to shape the kind of postwar world they wanted, which in economic terms meant a globe-spanning capitalist order centered exclusively upon the United States. This was the period when its global power was at its peak: the United States was the greatest economic power the world had known, with the greatest military machine in history. In February 1948, George F. Kennan&#x27;s Policy Planning Staff said: &quot;[W]e have about 50% of the world&#x27;s wealth but only 6.3% of its population. ... Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity.&quot; America&#x27;s allies and foes in Eurasia were still recovering from World War II at this time. Historian James Peck has described this version of globalism as &quot;visionary globalism&quot;. Per Peck, this was a far-reaching conception of &quot;American-centric state globalism using capitalism as a key to its global reach, integrating everything that it can into such an undertaking&quot;. This included global economic integration, which had collapsed under World War I and the Great Depression.

Modern globalism has been linked to the ideas of economic and political integration of countries and economies. The first person in the United States of America to use the term &quot;economic integration&quot; in its modern sense, such as combining separate economies into larger economic regions, was John S. de Beers, an economist in the United States Department of the Treasury, towards the end of 1941. By 1948, &quot;economic integration&quot; was appearing in an increasing number of American documents and speeches. Paul G. Hoffman, then head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, used the term in a 1949 speech to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized it thus:

Globalism emerged as a dominant set of ideologies in the late twentieth century. As these ideologies settled, and while various processes of globalization intensified, they contributed to the consolidation of a connecting global imaginary. In 2010, Manfred Steger and Paul James theorized this process in terms of four levels of change: changing ideas, ideologies, imaginaries and ontologies. Globalism has been seen as a pillar of a liberal international order along with democratic governance, open trade, and international institutions. At Brookings Institution, David G. Victor has suggested cooperation in carbon capture and storage technology could be a future element of globalism as part of global efforts against climate change.

== Usage in right-wing politics ==

&quot;Globalist&quot; has been used as a pejorative in right-wing and far-right politics, and in various conspiracy theories. During the election and presidency of United States president Donald Trump, he and members of his administration used the term &quot;globalist&quot; on multiple occasions. The administration was accused of using the term as an antisemitic dog whistle, and to associate their critics with a Jewish conspiracy. Followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory refer to what they term &quot;the Cabal&quot; as a secret worldwide elite organisation who wish to undermine democracy and freedom, and implement their own globalist agendas. Hungary&#x27;s prime minister Viktor Orbán has used antisemitic tropes in accusations against globalists, espousing a conspiracy theory of a world network controlled by Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros.
